The ring he was wearing on his hand deeply stung Wei Han\u2019s eyes\u2026</p><br/><p>The scene turned again, Qi Zhifan was in front of Wei Han, and he took up Chu Chuanyao\u2019s hand. The two smiled and went farther and farther, heads not turning back.</p><br/><p>Looking at his and Qi Zhifan\u2019s distant backs, Wei Han wanted to chase, but he couldn\u2019t catch up\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Yao!\u201d Wei Han suddenly sat up in bed, awakening from his sleep. He wiped his eyes and found they were a little wet.</p><br/><p>During the day, Qi Zhifan looked at his laptop and browsed Chu Chuanyao\u2019s personal data. Every time Qi Zhifan saw the picture of his face, he couldn\u2019t help but be in a bit of a trance.</p><br/><p>In the lower right corner of the computer screen, Pei Yuyang\u2019s QQ picture flashed non-stop. \u201cI Am Curlie\u2019s Little Tiger Teeth\u201d sent a lot of information. Qi Zhifan conveniently clicked it open.</p><br/><p>Since knowing Jiang Chengrui, Pei Yuyang had changed his QQ name, but the picture has always been his family\u2019s Archie. No matter which angle and which posture that was arranged, it was still an ugly black boar in Qi Zhifan\u2019s eyes. In this regard, starting from high school, Qi Zhifan\u2019s nickname for him has not changed and always been \u201cPei Pervert\u201d.</p><br/><p>Pei \u3010Dearest Ah Fan, what, are you satisfied? Do you want to give me a positive evaluation?\u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010This is what you asked me to investigate a few days ago. Chu Chuanyao, this person\u2019s three views are proper and has no bad habits. Anyway, in addition to those basic files, I\u2019ve also got his physical examination forms from small to big. Rest assured, he\u2019s not sick.\u3011</p><br/><p>Qi \u3010\u2026It seems like you\u2019re very good at this?\u3011</p><br/><p>Pei \u3010Don\u2019t dare say I\u2019m good at it, but \u2018unfamiliar at first, but soon accustomed to it\u2019. I had sent someone to check Curlie before: family background, hobbies, emotional experience, I\u2019m all very clear on. Now, even his butt has a mole, I know. Alas, I really want to see it with my own eyes, to touch it, to kiss it.\u3011</p><br/><p>Qi \u3010\u2026Goodbye\u3011</p><br/><p>Pei \u3010Hey, hey, hey, <i>yamete</i>! Good Ah Fan, I\u2019m being serious with you. Chu Chuanyao, he\u2026really looks like that guy?\u3011</p><br/><p>The next second, Pei Yuyang sent another picture. The resolution of the picture was not high. At first glance, it was an old picture. Two boys were shoulder-to-shoulder, leaning on each other. One of them was Qi Zhifan from junior high school, and the other\u2026</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan was slightly stunned and somewhat lost in thought. When he first saw Chu Chuanyao on the day of the accident, he really thought that the person had come back.</p><br/><p>Pei \u3010Ah Fan, in the past few years, you haven\u2019t had any true interactions with anyone. Is it because you\u2019ve never forgotten him?\u3011</p><br/><p>Qi \u3010You talk so much, beware of dying from your many words.\u3011</p><br/><p>After finishing the information, the somewhat displeased Qi Zhifan didn\u2019t want to deal with Pei Yuyang anymore, and decided to click the X and logout.</p><br/><p>Pulling out his bedside drawer again, Qi Zhifan looked at the sexy pink panties and was thoughtful again.</p><br/><p>In fact, he didn\u2019t tell Wei Han that he wanted to chase Chu Chuanyao, but even more didn\u2019t want Wei Han to be together with him. Why did Wei Han like Chu Chuanyao so much? So annoying.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan\u2019s pursuit of Chu Chuanyao was not as mild as Wei Han\u2019s, such as slowly taking an indirect approach, trying to hold hands, making appointments, sending gifts, and so on, these kind of lovey-dovey connections. He\u2019d stated his intentions to Wei Han the night before, and he immediately took action today.</p><br/><p>Downstairs from the faculty department building of the Economics Faculty, Qi Zhifan had both hands in his pockets, and was casually stationed there. The charm of his every gesture made people unable to move their eyes, and immediately aroused a crowd of onlookers.</p><br/><p>And the one who\u2019d caused the last term to roil with his and his brother\u2019s scandal, Wei Han, unexpectedly stood next to him. It was even more surprising, and the people all whispered and discussed it.</p><br/><p>Since Wei Han was frequently in contact with Chu Chuanyao, the scandal between him and Qi Zhifan had slowly faded. Now, Qi Zhifan also came running to the Economics Faculty. Was this the rhythm of catching the adulterous couple in the act?</p><br/><p>At this moment, Wei Han couldn\u2019t attend to the peculiar gaze of others. This morning, he had a very bad premonition. He secretly paid attention to Qi Zhifan\u2019s every move, and the result was that Qi Zhifan ran here to stop Chu Chuanyao! Wei Han certainly couldn\u2019t sit by, so he also followed along after Qi Zhifan.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Seeing Qi Zhifan stand and wait outside, Wei Han thought it was a little strange. He wanted to make a bid for Chu Chuanyao, but actually came empty-handed, not even preparing any gifts? Could it be that he was just going to open his mouth and confess? That was simply crude!</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t wait for long. The second before, a quite distressed Chu Chuanyao had a frowning face, and the next second, he smiled after seeing Wei Han and Qi Zhifan, these two brothers. \u201cHow come you\u2019re both here? Great! I was thinking of asking you about a little something.\u201d</p><br/><p>When would he give Qi Zhifan the opportunity to open his mouth? Wei Han rushed forward and patted his chest: \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Little Yao, don\u2019t hesitate to tell me. I\u2019ll help you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, that is\u2026\u201d Chu Chuanyao nodded, then lowered his voice and whispered, \u201cHow do you chase after a female teacher who\u2019s older than you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?!\u201d Wei Han was so shocked his jaw almost dropped.</p><br/><p>So, this day passed. Qi Zhifan said nothing to Chu Chuanyao, and also did nothing. Wei Han accepted the cruel fact that Chu Chuanyao had a crush on his female teacher, and took a whole day to accept it.</p><br/><p>The Qi home, after dinner, Dad Qi and Mother Wei watched TV together in the living room. The hard-working Wei Han was in the kitchen washing the dishes, chopsticks and plates, and Qi Zhifan also occasionally helped out.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Zhifan, you\u2019re going to give up like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han asked the question tentatively. He saw that Qi Zhifan had clearly made a solemn vow before. Now that he knew Chu Chuanyao had a secret crush on his female teacher, there was no longer any action.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a man who has someone else in his heart.\u201d Qi Zhifan didn\u2019t lift his head and continued washing the dishes.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh oh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han nodded and instantly felt relieved, but also inevitably cursed him in his heart: Odd Trouble asked that others only had him in their hearts, but his own heart didn\u2019t necessarily only have that person, for example, Lu Yan, ai.</p><br/><p>Seeing Wei Han\u2019s eyeballs roving around, Qi Zhifan had seen this expression a lot and immediately realized that Wei Han must be bad-mouthing him in his heart.</p><br/><p>Coldly glancing at him, Qi Zhifan very confidently said, \u201cI advise you to let go, and don\u2019t waste your time and energy. He doesn\u2019t look like someone who\u2019d fall for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to!\u201d Wei Han loudly retorted, a pair of black eyes shining, \u201cI will impress him with my sincerity. Even if it\u2019s a stone heart, it\u2019d heat up when covered.\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice hadn\u2019t fallen when Qi Zhifan put down the bowl with a \u2018<em>thump</em>\u2018. His entire body shrouded in a depression, he flung his hands and walked away.</p><hr/><br/><p>Chu Chuanyao\u2019s one-side love was a female teacher surnamed Dong, with flowing long hair and curvaceous body, was absolutely a managing older sister type. Professor Dong was twenty-six or twenty-seven years old, and had just returned from abroad. Not mentioning being pretty and sexy, she also had a Ph.D in Economics: a high IQ Ms. Perfect.</p><br/><p>Wei Han knew that anyway, in his past life, he was bent by Chu Chuanyao, but Chu Chuanyao was not the same in this life. Not only was he not bent, but he actually wanted to engage in a teacher-student love affair!</p><br/><p>Fate really was a bit disorderly without end. How come he hadn\u2019t known that Chu Chuanyao was hiding an older sister complex ah!</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Yao, if\u2026if you were rejected by her, then you\u2026\u201d Wei Han hesitated, somewhat unable to ask out loud.</p><br/><p>He wanted to ask Chu Chuanyao whether he could consider him. He would knead his shoulders, do his laundry and make the bed, but also very happily help him warm the bed.</p><br/><p>Chu Chuanyao waved his hand, his eyes abnormally firm: \u201cI will not give up so easily! Age is not a problem. She\u2019s certainly testing my patience and sincerity towards her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Why was Little Yao so single-mindedly infatuated ah! Could you give him a little chance?</p><br/><p>Forget it, this kind of thing couldn\u2019t be forced at the moment. This must be God testing his patience and sincerity towards Little Yao.</p><br/><p>Because before, Wei Han had patted his chest and made a promise, so now he was forced to help Chu Chuanyao to chase Professor Dong. Every time he thought of this, he couldn\u2019t help but beat his chest and stamp his feet, have that kind of regret ah.</p><br/><p>Wei Han had been bent for two lifetimes and only thought of Chu Chuanyao. Where would he understand how to gain a woman\u2019s favor? To this end, he took advantage of the time when his friends weren\u2019t around to secretly buy a comprehensive book on love and slowly studied it at home.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Chu Chuanyao\u2019s grades in his major were among the best, and he was particularly active in Professor Dong\u2019s class, so Professor Dong really liked him. After class, they also often talked on QQ and WeChat, even sometimes eating alone together.</p><br/><p>The relationship that started out as teacher-and-student, gradually became a kind of sibling relationship. Professor Dong always cared for Chu Chuanyao like an elder sister. Chu Chuanyao was joyful but distressed. He could never find a suitable opportunity to show her his heart, and also didn\u2019t dare to say it out loud.</p><br/><p>On Sunday morning at the dessert shop, Wei Han got permission from the store manager, Song Bohao, to bring Chu Chuanyao into the kitchen.</p><br/><p>Professor Dong\u2019s birthday was arriving soon. Chu Chuanyao had already prepared a gift, but still wanted to make a birthday cake for her, so he looked for Wei Han.</p><br/><p>Wei Han very much wanted to refuse, but in the face of Chu Chuanyao\u2019s pleading eyes, he could only shed blood and tears in his heart and promised with a smile on his face.</p><br/><p>After preparing the basic ingredients such as eggs, milk, low-gluten flour, sugar and cooking oil, Wei Han asked Chu Chuanyao to follow what he did. He did it himself on one side, and on the side, also reminded Chu Chuanyao of points to pay attention to at each step.</p><br/><p>The two were busy for a while. When the egg yolk mixture was evenly mixed, Wei Han used the egg beater to begin beating the egg whites. \u201cLittle Yao, you can drop in a few drops of lemon juice when you beat the egg whites, or white vinegar also works. This can neutralize the basicity of the egg whites.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Chuanyao nodded and immediately did so. After mixing for a while, it started to froth. Then Wei Han stopped and instructed, \u201cYou can add sugar at this time. Wait until the egg whites become airy, then you can add sugar the second time, approximately a third of the total amount.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen you pour the egg whites into the egg yolk mixture, you have to stir it in batches because the density is different. Little Yao, you just blindly turning it isn\u2019t enough. Like cooking, from time to time, turn the bottom, scrape the sides and fold it over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han taught very well, too busy to be distracted by thinking about other things. When he saw Chu Chuanyao made a mistake, he immediately corrected it with his hands. So even now, when he\u2019d already held Chu Chuanyao\u2019s hand, he was unaware of it. Not only did his face not blush and heart not jump, but the serious side of his face was also very handsome.</p><br/><p>Chu Chuanyao couldn\u2019t help but blank, the gaze looking at Wei Han becoming somewhat different, with a few more points of worship.</p><br/><p>Later, Wei Han poured the mixed batter into the drop bottom mold, raised the mold a little, and very skillfully shook it horizontally and vertically, shaking out the extra air bubbles. Then, it was placed into the oven.</p><br/><p>In the time while they were waiting, because Chu Chuanyao was going to make a fruit cake, Wei Han cut up some kiwifruit, pineapple, grapes and so on, and then he also stuffed a few grapes into the blankly staring Chu Chuanyao\u2019s mouth. He winked and laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWei\u2026Big Brother Wei, you\u2026you are so awesome ah, the God of Chefs ah!\u201d Chu Chuanyao\u2019s eyes lighted up.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Heh heh, I\u2019ll make some biscuits for you to eat.\u201d After saying this, he did it. Wei Han once again washed his hands, rolled up his sleeves, and was busy again.</p><br/><p>After the cake was baked, the buttery, sweet and flaky biscuits coated with plenty of milk and caramel sauce were also made: the outside light, crisp and sweet, and the inside flaky and soft. Also, these cup-shaped muffins and scones made people\u2019s mouth water from looking.</p><br/><p>Finally, Wei Han handed the carefully-packaged fruit cake to Chu Chuanyao. Chu Chuanyao smelled it, and only thought the milk fragrance was rich, the fruit fragrance was fresh, and immediately grinned.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Brother Wei, thank you so much! I\u2019ll buy you a big dinner sometime.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a small thing,\u201d Wei Han also laughed, but his heart was bleeding.</p><br/><p>After tearfully sending off Chu Chuanyao, Wei Han belatedly came to realize that these two days were clearly the weekend, but Jiang Chengrui unexpectedly hadn\u2019t even shown up in the shop.</p><br/><p>\u201cManager, Little Jiang didn\u2019t come to the store today?\u201d</p><br/><p><b>The author has something to say: </b></p><br/><p>Author: Trouble is still gradually determining his own intention\u2026</p><br/><p>Silly Han: (\u2299o\u2299) Determining what intention? What happens when it\u2019s confirmed?</p><br/><p>Author: A certain person\u2019s chrysanthemum can\u2019t be protected eh!</p><br/><p>Silly Han: Who\u2019s this certain person? Anyways, it\u2019s definitely not me. Bro\u2019s a <i>gong</i>~</p><div><div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

In the next second, he hurriedly took off his jacket and put it on Qi Zhifan. \u201cHow can I let a little brother spoil a big brother ah? Anyway, I already promised Uncle Qi and Mom Wei to take good care of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Without the \u201clove rival\u201d relationship with Qi Zhifan, Wei Han really wanted to be a good brother.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan took the chance to catch Wei Han\u2019s hand and held it tightly. Then, he looked into his eyes and said, \u201cWei Han, I don\u2019t want you as this kind of idiotic older brother, I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSilly Han, what are you doing there? The rain\u2019s getting heavier. We have to find a place to shelter from the rain,\u201d not far from them, Jiang Chengrui suddenly shouted, interrupting Qi Zhifan\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>The rain was fierce and soon turned into a torrential downpour. Luckily, Wei Han and them found a cave in time and hid in there.</p><br/><p>Seeing that the torrential rain wouldn\u2019t stop for a while, and finding no beasts\u2019 footprints, feces or nests around the cave, they thought that the time was not early, and they planned to spend the night there.</p><br/><p>The fire was started, and they scattered some ashes near the cave entrance to prevent snakes and poisonous insects from invading. Later, after they had eaten a simple meal, they were ready to go to sleep. However, there were too many uncertain risk factors in the field and they still had to take turns to keep a night watch.</p><br/><p>The first half of the night was Jiang Chengrui and Pei Yuyang together. The second half of the night, they were replaced by Wei Han and Qi Zhifan.</p><br/><p>Two people sat beside the fire. Seeing Wei Han rubbing his eyes and yawning repeatedly with an appearance of not having enough sleep, Qi Zhifan used his elbow to nudge him. \u201cHey, you go to sleep. I can keep watch alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han waved his hand. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not okay. We\u2019ve agreed that it\u2019d be two people together. Besides, the two of us can still chat to kill the time. If you\u2019re alone and get too bored ah, you\u2019d easily get sleepy and doze off\u2026<i>achoo</i>!\u201d</p><br/><p>While talking, Wei Han suddenly sneezed, and Qi Zhifan\u2019s brows creased.</p><br/><p>\u201c<i>a\u2026achoo! achoo</i>!\u201d Wei Han successively sneezed several times again. He touched his nose and wryly smiled at Qi Zhifan. \u201cOdd Trouble, I seem to have a cold. Don\u2019t sit next to me, to avoid infecting you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What was this called? Qi Zhifan stuck closer instead, his big hand touching Wei Han\u2019s forehead. Fortunately, this blockhead didn\u2019t have a fever.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo sleep,\u201d Qi Zhifan said with a serious face.</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s head shook like a rattle. \u201cOdd Trouble, let\u2019s chat. Tell me about some fun things from your childhood. What did you like to play when you were little?\u201d</p><br/><p>Toward this genius little brother, Wei Han was still very curious.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan picked up a tree branch and began to draw on the earth. Wei Han stared, and soon, Qi Zhifan drew out a music staff.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the score for a piano song?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, Canon\u2019s staff.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ah hey, was this the rhythm of bullying him for having less learning?</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, I don\u2019t really understand this.\u201d The corners of Wei Han\u2019s mouth pulled, barely squeezing out a smile. \u201cOdd Trouble, why don\u2019t we just talk about something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTalk about something? Sure, right after the three-month training session, don\u2019t you also have the final exam? Then now, I will help you review the theoretical knowledge.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han didn\u2019t respond for a while. Qi Zhifan opened his mouth and recited the police law from heart. Wei Han listened to the first few articles of the general provision law, and unexpectedly, it was exactly the same as the ones written in the book.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Fuck, Odd Trouble, are you really human? Can we enjoy ourselves and play happily?</p><br/><p>In Qi Zhifan\u2019s mouth\u2014article by article from the police law general provisions: from authorities to duties and discipline to the organization and management\u2014Wei Han listened in a daze. He thought that Qi Zhifan had good intentions, so he couldn\u2019t interrupt Qi Zhifan.</p><br/><p>The rules and regulations of the law were quite dreary; usually Wei Han became mush when he listened to them. At this time, they really were comparable to a hypnotic spell. He felt his eyelids getting heavier, then his eyes closed, and finally, not too long later, completely threw himself into <b>Zhou Gong\u2019s</b> embrace. (T/N: God of Dreams)</p><br/><p>Seeing Wei Han leaning on his shoulder, already fast asleep, Qi Zhifan hooked his lips and smiled. Very good, the goal had been achieved.</p><br/><p>Not daring to move too much, Qi Zhifan slowly eased Wei Han to lie down, and then gently placed Wei Han\u2019s head on his lap. The ground was as hard as a board and really uncomfortable. In order to ensure that Wei Han could sleep comfortably, Qi Zhifan simply let him directly rest his head on his thighs to sleep.</p><br/><p>Such treatment, Wei Han was the first one.</p><br/><p>By the firelight, Qi Zhifan reached out his hand and pushed aside the fringe in front of Wei Han\u2019s forehead and carefully examined the face that he\u2019d missed for more than two months. Wei Han\u2019s cheeks on both sides couldn\u2019t pinch out any flesh, thin and sunken down, but the contours of the eyebrows were a lot more distinct; his blanched lips were cracked through, which wasn\u2019t good, and his right hand had several cuts.</p><br/><p>He clearly knew that if he lifted Wei Han\u2019s clothes, his back, waist and legs must have a lot of bruises. This silly\u2026thinking to here, Qi Zhifan\u2019s heart was slightly cut apart.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Wei Han turned around and turned his face to the inner side of Qi Zhifan\u2019s thigh. The breaths he exhaled, all without exception, blew in the middle of Qi Zhifan\u2019s crotch\u2026</p><br/><p>How could he endure this intense stimulation? Qi Zhifan was shamefully hard, the tall small tent propped up near Wei Han\u2019s slightly open mouth.</p><br/><p>The dark tips in his eyes pulsing, Qi Zhifan tightened his lips. With a big hand, he grabbed Wei Han\u2019s perky butt, and kneaded and pinched those two round, soft flesh\u2026</p><br/><p>This night was doomed to be long and agonizing.</p><br/><p>Early next morning, the heavy rain that had fallen all night finally stopped. Wei Han woke up and, finding that he had slept on Qi Zhifan\u2019s thighs for a night, immediately jumped up in fright.</p><br/><p>\u201cOdd\u2026Odd Trouble, I\u2019m\u2026I\u2019m sorry ah!\u201d Wei Han apologized in a panic, \u201cI accidentally fell asleep last night.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Wei Han flustered, the just-awakened Qi Zhifan shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Did you sleep well last night?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan was obviously asking a rhetorical question, thinking that he had contributed his own thighs to serve Wei Han.</p><br/><p>Wei Han nodded. \u201cMhm, usually when I wake up during training, I almost always have a sore waist and back pain. But today, it\u2019s only a little butt pain, as if I was mercilessly pinched by someone, strange.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After packing up their things, the four people took up their backpacks again, and they left the cave to continue on their journey.</p><br/><p>After a single-log bridge, they came to a thicket of bushes. They hadn\u2019t walked for long when \u201c<i>bang</i>\u201c, a gunshot echoed, frightening Wei Han and them.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>So, they ran in the direction of the gunshot and soon saw Shao Yi and several of his attendant brothers. Under their feet, there was wild boar that had just fallen to the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cYo, look who it is.\u201d</p><br/><p>The pointy mouth, monkey-cheeked younger brother from before blew his whistle when he saw them, constipated with anger and brimming with provocation.</p><br/><p>Shao Yi coldly snorted and also raised his nose to the sky with an arrogant attitude. The first evening they\u2019d come here, when he\u2019d first seen the newcomers Qi Zhifan and Pei Yuyang, he\u2019d been unmindful and let Qi Zhifan win. Now, if they were to fight again, it wasn\u2019t certain who\u2019d win and who\u2019d lose.</p><br/><p>\u201cShao Yi, what are you doing! There are rules that you can\u2019t over-hunt wild animals,\u201d Jiang Chengrui was the first to rush forward and resentfully shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot killing a few to eat, could it be we\u2019d want to starve to death? Laozi also want to kill a few deers and try the taste of venison,\u201d another fat younger brother shouted.</p><br/><p>Wei Han also wanted to say something, but his eyelid kept jumping non-stop, and he suddenly had a very bad feeling.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, there was a gust of evil wind in the forest and the ground vibrated. From the rear came the sound of a herd of wild boars\u2019 roaring grunts, charging over from afar. The several leading big boars were not the ordinary type of big bodies either. Everyone was immediately alarmed!</p><br/><p>Fuck, this was a fucking herd of wild boars rushing toward them!</p><br/><p>Faster than words could tell, everyone quickly scattered, pale with fright. Because of yesterday\u2019s heavy rain, the soil was loose. When Shao Yi was hurrying, his foot slipped, and his body fell down one side of the steep slope.</p><br/><p>Upon seeing this, Wei Han roused and grabbed Shao Yi\u2019s arm, but the downward impact was too great. He couldn\u2019t save the person, but also fell down the steep slope with him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWei Han!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan reached out his hand to pull, but it was too late. He couldn\u2019t even grasp his clothes. Wei Han and Shao Yi both rolled to the bottom, and their figures could no longer be seen.</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t know how many layers of shrubs they crashed through, Wei Han and Shao Yi\u2019s bodies uncontrollably rolled, uneven ground and tree branches digging into them extremely painfully. Halfway down, there were also large and small rocks that rolled down with them, smashing into Wei Han and several times, he almost fainted.</p><br/><p>When the tumbling finally stopped, Wei Han didn\u2019t directly faint because he\u2019d been desperately biting his lower lip to resist falling unconscious. His eyeballs turned, wanting to see Shao Yi\u2019s situation.</p><br/><p>Head and face covered with grime, Shao Yi was lying not far away, but his condition seemed a little bad. His left foot was pressed under a big stone, and he\u2019d also fainted.</p><br/><p>Frightened, Wei Han hurriedly climbed up. He gritted his teeth and lifted up the big stone, pulling out the crushed left foot.</p><br/><p>He crouched down and examined Shao Yi\u2019s left foot, also weighing it with his hand. Wei Han sighed, ai, it was estimated that this ankle bone was probably broken.</p><br/><p>Wei Han looked at Shao Yi\u2019s face again, thinking that even though Shao Yi was always set against him and wasn\u2019t a good person, but he wasn\u2019t some evil villain ah. In the end, he still carried him on his back.</p><br/><p>After looking at the surrounding environment, Wei Han\u2019s face became even worse: wretched, they really were lost this time.</p><br/><p>They had rolled down from above and certainly couldn\u2019t climb back up. It seemed that they had to find a new road. The map wasn\u2019t on him, so they could only take one step at a time.</p><div><div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

What happened to you all of a sudden?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han was pressed and a little uncomfortable. Qi Zhifan\u2019s body was like a fire closely affixed to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnswer me. Do you not see anyone else except Chu Chuanyao?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Qi Zhifan uncharacteristically not letting him off and unyielding in his questioning, Wei Han\u2019s scalp went numb. \u201cNo, I\u2026I, I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Not letting Wei Han continue, Qi Zhifan lowered his head and blocked his mouth with a kiss. Startled, Wei Han suddenly widened his eyes.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan frantically sucked and bit Wei Han\u2019s soft lips. Following right after, he immediately pried open Wei Han\u2019s lips and drove his tongue straight in, gently sweeping over his gums, and then chasing, licking and sucking his tongue, constantly deepening this overbearing kiss.</p><br/><p>Wei Han intensely felt Qi Zhifan\u2019s heavy breath chaotically sweeping over his face, but also the shameful wet noises drilled into his eardrums. His heart beat very fast, as if it\u2019d jump out at any time.</p><br/><p>Seeing Wei Han\u2019s face reddened and nearly unable to breathe, Qi Zhifan finally let go of Wei Han\u2019s lips. But he didn\u2019t let go of Wei Han. Instead, he bit his ear, nimble tongue wandering in the hollow of his ear and between his neck, teasing back and forth.</p><br/><p>Finally, Qi Zhifan even spread open Wei Han\u2019s shirt collar and nipped his collarbone. Wei Han was scared. With a burst of trembling, he reached out and pushed away Qi Zhifan, who was pressed on him.</p><br/><p>In only a split second, Qi Zhifan\u2019s actions stopped. Then, he slowly stood up because he\u2019d felt Wei Han\u2019s rejection.</p><br/><p>\u201cWei Han, can we only be brothers between us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan asked with a faint expression, but in the depths of his eyes was a thread of disappointment and powerlessness.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Wei Han was completely dumbfounded. His brain had blanked, simply unable to think at all. After all, he\u2019d just suffered the greatest impact: many \u201cfirsts\u201d were taken away just like that.</p><br/><p>Seeing Wei Han remained silent, Qi Zhifan gave two bitter laughs, and then \u201c<i>thump</i>\u201c, he closed the door and left the house, not returning that night.</p><br/><p>This day, Wei Han was helping Mother Wei at the flower shop. In the last few days, Mother Wei had always looked miserable because of her two sons\u2019 matter, and was somewhat distressed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHan-han, tell me, is Fan-fan in his rebellious period? He\u2019s actually willing to leave our warm home and move out alone; it makes me so sad. Was it because I did something bad?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMom, don\u2019t think too much, you\u2019re fine. And at his age, Qi Zhifan has already had his rebellious period long ago. Him moving out should\u2026should be for his own reasons,\u201d Wei Han comforted. When he thought of Qi Zhifan, his chest felt somewhat unbearably stifled.</p><br/><p>Wei Han remembered that day, after the abnormal Qi Zhifan had pressed him on the sofa and did those mess of things, he\u2019d never returned home.</p><br/><p>Later, Qi Hao had called and asked, only to learn that he was living outside. He had asked for the reason, and Qi Zhifan also casually gave a few perfunctory words: saying that he was going to take an internship and that it would be more convenient to live outside.</p><br/><p>Seeing that his son hadn\u2019t wanted to say more, Qi Hao also hadn\u2019t asked more. Unlike his father, he\u2019d always believed that Qi Zhifan had his own judgment and he would respect it.</p><br/><p>\u201cAi, that\u2019s true.\u201d After listening to Wei Han\u2019s words, Mother Wei nodded her head. Suddenly, she pointed to Wei Han and suspiciously said, \u201cHan-han, is it possible that you often bully Fan-fan, and then he was heartbroken and left home?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve wronged me, mom. How would I dare to bully him?\u201d Wei Han shook his head.</p><br/><p>He\u2019d only been bullied by Odd Trouble, okay?</p><br/><p>Although at the beginning when Wei Han had come to this family, as his older brother, he\u2019d really wanted to bully him and abuse him, but in the end, he was unable to mess with Odd Trouble. Instead, he was pitted again and again, adding to the countless foolish, black history ah.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Okay. Ai, Han-han, are you lovesick?\u201d Mother Wei asked, concerned about her big son.</p><br/><p>\u201cLovesick?\u201d Wei Han stared blankly and softly said, \u201cProbably, it can be considered that\u2026\u201d</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>It hadn\u2019t been easy for him to determine that he liked Qi Zhifan. But that day, he seemed to have hurt Qi Zhifan, and then Qi Zhifan left like that, no longer keeping in contact with him.</p><br/><p>Later, Wei Han sent a text message, but he hadn\u2019t replied. Calling? Because that day was too embarrassing, Wei Han momentarily hadn\u2019t dared to talk to Qi Zhifan, so he never dared to call. This caused Wei Han to stay on the three characters \u201cOdd Trouble\u201d in the address book for a good while everyday.</p><br/><p>Looking at Wei Han\u2019s dejected expression, Mother Wei patted him on the back. \u201cAi, I knew it would be like this. Else, without rhyme or reason, how could you take your head and have it shaved like a monk? Han-han, to tell the truth, when mother saw your bald head that day, my god, it was so ugly I almost didn\u2019t dare to recognize.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Mom, are you really my mother?</p><br/><p>The hair wouldn\u2019t grow long in a short time, so Wei Han had to borrow a lot of hats from Jiang Chengrui. Anyway, Jiang Chengrui had many hats, and Pei Yuyang would frequently send him the latest styles of hats. Picking some that hadn\u2019t been worn, Jiang Chengrui simply gave them to Wei Han.</p><br/><p>Every time he saw the pitiful black stubble on top of Wei Han\u2019s head, Jiang Chengrui couldn\u2019t help but reach out and touch it. \u201cSilly Han ah, that day when you decided to get a haircut, did your head get mercilessly pressed by the door when you went out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>That evening, Wei Han was on the internet. He wasn\u2019t too eager to tell the people he knew about his emotional problems with Qi Zhifan, and believed that he could rely on the wisdom of the vast number of netizens to resolve this.</p><br/><p>Searching for several same-sex dating sites, Wei Han casually clicked into one. The homepage had a variety of portrait shots, all were gay friends from every part of the country. The two sidebars also had high-energy films and large-scale photo galleries. The chat room also flashed in the lower right corner of the webpage. Once Wei Han saw this, his whole body tensed and couldn\u2019t help but remember that day when he was overpowered by Qi Zhifan on the sofa, and then\u2026</p><br/><p>Your mom, bro\u2019s obviously a <i>gong</i> ah!</p><br/><p>After shaking his head, Wei Han clicked into the forum and found the board related to emotions. Then he prepared to post.</p><br/><p>When registering his username, the two sock puppets, \u201cFuck Buddy Lord 366\u201d and \u201cPastry Lord\u201d, suddenly flashed in his mind. Thinking about those things that had happened before in S Uni\u2019s BBS , it was a fucking shameful muddled accounts.</p><br/><p>After a short while, Wei Han posted a message for help.</p><br/><p>Stomach Very Hot Very Hot Ah: \u3010Help\u3011I like my younger brother, what should I do?</p><br/><p>In the post, Wei Han stated that he followed a remarried mother and entered a new family. He explained that he and Qi Zhifan were not related to each other, and he also briefly mentioned their former \u201clove rival\u201d relationship.</p><br/><p>Also, recently he discovered that the person he liked wasn\u2019t Chu Chuanyao, but Qi Zhifan, but Qi Zhifan suddenly ignored him and also left home.</p><br/><p>After waiting for a few minutes, one by one, Wei Han received some messages.</p><br/><p>1st post: Directly get on \u2642!</p><br/><p>2nd post: If you like then go chase. You must rely on yourself to fight for your own happiness!</p><br/><p>3rd post: Fight for it as much as possible. Clearly ask him, does he like you or not? And, after all is said and done, can you come together in the end? You\u2019d still need to go through a lot.</p><br/><p>4th post: May the world\u2019s love rivals become husbands!</p><br/><p>5th post: Go after it! Don\u2019t dilly-dally, are you a man or not?</p><br/><p>Seeing everyone\u2019s encouraging messages, Wei Han clenched his fist, suddenly brimming with confidence. Yeah, he wanted to brazenly confess! He vowed to make Qi Zhifan gasping and breathless under his body!</p><br/><p>The next day was just the weekend. Wei Han specially wore a fairly stylish outfit and matched it up with a good hat. Then, he asked Mother Wei for the address and went over to where Qi Zhifan lived.</p><br/><p>In S City, the different high-end villas were linked together. The black fence surrounding them isolated them from the outside world. The place where Qi Zhifan lived was very close to Pei Yuyang. Anyway, the people who lived here were all wealthy and respectable people.</p><br/><p>Wei Han stood at the door, carrying the tiramisu he\u2019d made in his hand, and rang the doorbell.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>The doorbell had a video intercom. Wei Han was planning to make his identity known when the voice of a middle-aged uncle came out, \u201cIs it Young Master Wei Han?\u201d</p><br/><p>Young master? Wei Han was foolish. He\u2019d lived for so long, but this was the first time someone had called him \u201cyoung master\u201d.</p><br/><p>Scratching his head, Wei Han was a little embarrassed. \u201cMhm, I am, but you can just call me \u2018Wei Han\u2019, I can\u2019t afford to accept this \u2018young master\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that end, Butler Sun said gravely, \u201cApologies, but this does not conform to custom. Young Master Wei Han, please come in first.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as he entered the door, Butler Sun stationed inside smiled and welcomed Wei Han. Then, he led Wei Han through a rock garden courtyard to reach the entrance of the back court.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Master Qi is inside,\u201d Butler Sun pointed inside the house.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han nodded at him and then he went in. Not long after he entered, a melodious piano sound drifted out. In the center of the first floor living room, there was a black grand piano. Qi Zhifan was playing a tune, and the little cousin, Wu Yunqi, was sitting by his side.</p><br/><p>Looking at this situation, it was obvious that Qi Zhifan was teaching his little cousin to play the piano.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to disturb you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han awkwardly said. Fuck, why was this little loli here? How can he still happily confess?</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan gave him a faint look. \u201cIs there something? Brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Wei Han\u2019s heart <i>\u201cba-dump\u201d</i> and he was silly.</p><br/><p>In Qi Zhifan\u2019s mouth, this disharmonious and undiluted \u201cbrother\u201d sound, made him blank. Wei Han was so frightened that he simply forgot the over hundreds of lines of confession in his heart. Suddenly, he couldn\u2019t even say a single word.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there something?\u201d Qi Zhifan repeated, still expressionless.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026uh, I came to give you some food.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han reluctantly squeezed out a smile, and lifted the tiramisu that he\u2019d carried for a long time in his hands and put it on the table.</p><br/><p>\u201cYunqi, go and eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ignoring Wei Han, Qi Zhifan turned to look at Wu Yunqi by his side.</p><br/><p>\u201cMhm, okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yunqi smiled and came over, giving Wei Han a meaningful look and whispering in his ear, \u201cHey, Wei Foxy Spirit, did you cause Brother Zhifan to be sad?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Wei Han shook his head, only feeling sour inside.</p><br/><p>Wu Yunqi sighed, suddenly smiled coldly and said, \u201cGreat. Brother Zhifan is very cold towards you. It seems like I still have a very good chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, Wei Han was simply deaf to what Wu Yunqi was saying. The destructive power of Qi Zhifan\u2019s \u201cbrother\u201d word was really too big, becoming a thick, invisible barrier that separated the two of them.</p><br/><p>Not a moment later, Wei Han also didn\u2019t want to invite a snub, so hanging his head, he returned home. He didn\u2019t know that Qi Zhifan stood in front of the French window on the second floor to watch him leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Ah Fan, exactly what are you thinking?\u201d Pei Yuyang called after a few days.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat else can I mean ah, don\u2019t play dumb. From you suddenly moving out to live alone to your recent attitude towards Wei Han, Ah Fan, what kind of medicine are you selling inside this bottle gourd?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Qi Zhifan hooked up his lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Pei Yuyang thought for a moment. \u201cCould it because Wei Han is bald now, you\u2019d be frightened early the next morning when you got out of bed, so you were so scared that you didn\u2019t dare to stay at home?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScram!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, okay okay, I won\u2019t joke.\u201d After laughing, Pei Yuyang solemnly said, \u201cSeriously, Curlie told me that Wei Han has been inattentive these few days, always in a daze. Ah Fan, don\u2019t you like him? How come now\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan interrupted him, \u201cThis is called \u2018playing hard to get\u2019. Are you foolish?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Suddenly, Pei Yuyang was really foolish. The next second, he laughed, \u201cWell, good Ah Fan, your black-bellied attribute has finally been exposed.\u201d</p><br/><p><b>Notes</b></p><ul><li><b>Playing hard to get: </b>() \u2018loosening the reins, only to grasp them better\u2019</li></ul><div><div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

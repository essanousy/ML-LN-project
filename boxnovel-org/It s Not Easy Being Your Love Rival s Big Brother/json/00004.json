The blue veins on his forehead jumped. Wei Han quickly broke loose and hid.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig\u2026big brother, I\u2019m a 1. Just like you, I push other people down.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little mustache uncle listened with a strange expression on his face, \u201cWhat, you\u2019re actually a 1? No matter how Laozi looks, you don\u2019t look like it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han was crying without tears. He forced a smile and tried to persuade him, \u201cYou can\u2019t judge people by their appearances. How can you look at the face to tell this kind of thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>If you just look at the face, then with Qi Zhifan\u2019s pretty face, it\u2019d make people want to pounce on him within minutes.</p><br/><p>\u201cTch, but I just like your little face. Why don\u2019t we compare our penises to see whose is bigger? If yours isn\u2019t bigger than mine, then obediently let me press you down.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished talking, little mustache uncle prepared to pull down Wei Han\u2019s pants.</p><br/><p>At this moment, there were thousands of mud horses running through Wei Han\u2019s heart. <i>Fuck me, how did I fall under this unscrupulous uncle\u2019s gaze!</i></p><br/><p>There were a lot of people playing in the big room. Originally, it was just the small movements of men flirting in the corner, and it didn\u2019t attract too much attention from other people. But as Wei Han resisted more and more fiercely, the two people\u2019s movements became somewhat bigger, and other people\u2019s sights also slowly shifted.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey Gavin, look. Bear Brother seems to have run into a spirited kid tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Yan smiled and pointed his finger. Qi Zhifan looked in the direction he was pointing at and narrowed his eyes. He felt that the man who was being teased by little mustache uncle looked familiar.</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s struggles caused\u2026a sexy pink thong to fall out from his pant pocket. It was so bright, it blinded the eyes of everyone present.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Amidst the other people\u2019s laughter, Qi Zhifan frown deepened. He\u2019d recognized Wei Han.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck! Enough nonsense. Kid, you still dare to say you\u2019re not a 0, but still carry that thing around, heh heh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little mustache uncle picked up the thong and tossed it to Wei Han, a wretched smile on his face.</p><br/><p>Wei Han held the thing that came over, and at this moment, his face turned red with shame. To have this kind of thing fall out under everyone\u2019s gaze, no one could hold on to their dignity.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026this, this, this really isn\u2019t mine. Someone forced it on me. I really had no choice but to accept.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han hurriedly explained, but little mustache uncle\u2019s hands clamped Wei Han\u2019s shoulders forcefully, entirely deaf to his explanation. \u201cLess fucking nonsense. Anyways, now it\u2019s yours! Since you can accept it, then you should be able to accept sleeping with me for a few nights.\u201d</p><br/><p>Obviously, little mustache uncle was trying to \u201cforce himself on him\u201d, this kind of trick. Little Yan suddenly felt a chill beside him. He turned his head, and when he saw Qi Zhifan\u2019s look had become especially gloomy, immediately shouted, \u201cBear Brother, don\u2019t make a fuss here. Even if you want to force someone, you could casually find a place. Don\u2019t you see Gavin\u2019s mood hasn\u2019t recovered yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know. I wouldn\u2019t dare to disturb our Gavin here,\u201d Bear Brother answered.</p><br/><p>The next second, Qi Zhifan clenched his fist again. The always discerning Little Yan didn\u2019t know that he\u2019d thought wrongly this time.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026I am Qi Zhifan\u2019s brother!\u201d In an emergency, seeing that he can\u2019t defend his chastity, Wei Han didn\u2019t care about the other and yelled out loudly.</p><br/><p>Everyone: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Bear Brother\u2019s disbelieving look, Wei Han emphasized again, \u201cReally\u2026it\u2019s true! I\u2019m really Qi Zhifan\u2019s older brother, your Gavin\u2019s older brother. If you don\u2019t believe me, then ask him.\u201d</p><br/><p>As a result, one after the other, everyone looked at Qi Zhifan who had been in a depression all along. Qi Zhifan was silent, neither admitting nor denying. His attitude was to completely ignore the person.</p><br/><p>Wei Han, who\u2019d thought he had caught a lifeline, was stupefied. What the hell!</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan, this little brother was too heartless, right? Even if they didn\u2019t have any blood relationship, he didn\u2019t even remember brotherly feelings. Whether good or bad, they still lived under the same roof. What\u2019s more, the bastard even ate how many of his home-cooked meals!</p><br/><p>Bear Brother grunted and sneered: \u201cHaha, you shouldn\u2019t try to worm your way into being Gavin\u2019s friend. He\u2019s not to be trifled with. You should just obediently lie in my arms tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease just let me go. In fact, as long as it\u2019s not sleeping with me, I\u2019m willing to do anything else.</p><br/><p>I can cook delicious food. Whatever you want to eat, I can cook for you.\u201d Qi Zhifan was completely unreliable from the start. Wei Han could only use his expertise in fine cuisine to entice the other.</p><br/><p>Bear Brother: \u201cI\u2019m not hungry right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen something to drink? I also learned a bit of bartending, and can mix a cocktail for you to drink.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe drinks here are ready-made, you mix a fart! Laozi only wants to get on you.\u201d Bear Brother was already very impatient.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>\u201cSing\u2026singing! Then alright, I can sing a little song to amuse big brother and make you happy, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at the trembling Wei Han with face wanting to cry from embarrassment, Little Yan, who was watching the liveliness, suddenly became interested and smiled, \u201cOh, then you sing a song for us to hear.\u201d</p><br/><p>A dark light quickly flashed through Qi Zhifan\u2019s pupils.</p><br/><p>In this situation in a gay bar, Wei Han\u2019s eyes spun around, thinking. Finally, he cleared his throat and \u201cheart tearing and lung splittingly\u201d sung loudly at the top of his lungs\u2013</p><br/><p><i>\u201cHorseman, you\u2019re so mighty and magnificent, horse galloping like a storm. Endless wilderness as you go wandering. Your heart is as vast as the earth\u2026</i></p><br/><p><i>Horseman, you\u2019re in my heart. I wish to melt in your broad chest, endless wilderness go with you to wander. All the days are as sunny as you\u2026\u201d</i></p><br/><p>Everyone: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan decisively got up and left.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck, too fucking bad, so bad I want to throw up! Kid, you\u2019re looking for a beating!\u201d</p><br/><p>After little mustache uncle heard this song, he completely had no interest in sleeping with Wei Han and only wanted to beat him up.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was born tone deaf. It\u2019s not my fault,\u201d Wei Han said as if he\u2019d been wronged.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you dared to fucking sing out for this Laozi to hear, then it\u2019s your fault!\u201d</p><br/><p>Little mustache uncle lifted his foot and kicked. This time he was really angry. Tormented by this kid for so long, his lust was choked to death. But he still had to vent out his bellyful of anger.</p><br/><p>His foot kicked Wei Han far away. The empty bottles that were piled on the table fell on him, landing on his aching belly. He couldn\u2019t help but spit out a mouthful of acid water.</p><br/><p>Bear Brother originally came from a shady background, and his anger didn\u2019t disappear. He again went over and ruthlessly gave him a few more kicks, the pain making Wei Han dazed for awhile.</p><br/><p>In this dazed state, Wei Han unconsciously recalled some things from his past life.</p><br/><p>He was bullied by his classmates when he was a child. When he worked a part-time job while attending school, he was defrauded by an evil boss. At first, he used his chef\u2019s certificate to work in a restaurant. With great difficulty, he waited until he had a chance to be promoted to a chef, only to have the manager\u2019s nephew come in through the back door. Then he went to the cake shop, and the \u2018bully the weak, fear the strong\u2019 miserly shop owner used him as free labor\u2026</p><br/><p>Wei Han wasn\u2019t stupid, but he was used to keeping the peace, and never excessively resisted. He would rather suffer more grievances, and swallow whatever complaints he had into his own stomach rather than cause trouble.</p><br/><p>But being reborn again, in this life, he must change this!</p><br/><p>Grabbing an empty wine bottle on the ground, Wei Han climbed up. Completely throwing caution to the wind, he aimed at Bear Brother\u2019s head and smashed with a \u201cbang\u201d. The wine bottle shattered and the blood poured down.</p><br/><p>Blood everywhere! Other people\u2019s eyes were full of turmoil. Little Yan\u2019s mind also darkly said <i>no good</i>. The development seemed to be getting worse.</p><br/><p>There was a small puncture hole on his forehead. Although it wasn\u2019t a big injury, it still made Bear Brother\u2019s teeth ached. He seized Wei Han, \u201cOh, are you fucking looking to die?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDear, how did you run to here?\u201d</p><br/><p>A low and graceful voice suddenly drifted in. Dressed in a violet shirt, a man wearing the same-colored earrings on his ears looked at Wei Han with an intimate look in his eyes. He looked to be in his twenties.</p><br/><p>Bear Brother was shocked, and he immediately let go. Wei Han turned and stared at this gay violet, and silently thought, <i>Hey, hey, who are you calling \u201cdear\u201d?</i></p><br/><p>\u201cPei\u2026Master Pei?! What wind brought you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Yan laughed \u201chehe\u201d and went up to greet him, bowing and scraping. Pei Yuyang was the City Section Chief Pei\u2019s third son. They were only small minions, and absolutely couldn\u2019t afford to offend him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal. I was just looking for a person.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pei Yuyang waved his hand casually and grabbed Wei Han. His outstanding, handsome and bright face held a tender, honeyed smile. \u201cAh, dear, you\u2019ve had enough fun tonight. We should go home.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Wei Han was still very depressed. When did he become this gay violet\u2019s \u201cdear\u201d? Moreover, looking at the other people\u2019s pale and uncertain faces, this person\u2019s identity wasn\u2019t small.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry! Master Pei, I\u2026I really didn\u2019t know he was your man.\u201d Bear Brother completely had none of his imposing manners now, his face deathly pale.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, this statement is a bit wrong.\u201d Pei Yuyang shook his head, but didn\u2019t explain. He glanced at the wound on Bear Brother\u2019s forehead and lazily said, \u201cI\u2019ll pay for your medical expenses. You should first rest well for a few days.\u201d</p><br/><p>In this way, the gay violet who inexplicable appeared and kept calling him \u201cdear\u201d, brought Wei Han out.</p><br/><p>As soon as he saw that he was out of danger, Wei Han immediately took Pei Yuyang\u2019s hand off his shoulder, face puzzled said, \u201cHey, who the hell are you? I obviously don\u2019t know you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know me now?\u201d Pei Yuyang swept his front bangs, a roving smile in his eyes, \u201cMy name is Pei Yuyang, and I can be seen as\u2026your friend.\u201d</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t agreed to be friends with you yet.\u201d Wei Han was still very wary, and his expression leveled, \u201cRight, do you also want to sleep with me? I\u2019m telling you clearly, this brother is a 1.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOK, I understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo calm? Could it be you\u2019re a 0?\u201d Wei Han said without thinking, but seeing this person\u2019s reaction, his whole body became very alert and retreated back. \u201cNo! I\u2019m not interested in pressing you down. I have no affections for you. Don\u2019t think about it, and don\u2019t be eager to force me. Hey! You say, you look taller and more handsome than me. How could you want someone like me to press you down? You\u2019re a shaking M, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWei\u2026Wei Han\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Pei Yuyang\u2019s smile became somewhat shaky. He clearly hadn\u2019t say anything, but the thoughts of the person in front him had already floated far away. Besides getting out of hand, his mental associative power was truly astonishing.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, how do you know my name? You wouldn\u2019t have investigated everything beforehand, right?\u201d Wei Han became increasingly uneasy and continued to retreat.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Ah Fan. He called me over. Qi Zhifan, your little brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Wei Han retreating further away, Pei Yuyang, who was treated as a villain, expressed his true innocence.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Wei Han\u2019s mood became somewhat complicated.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Ah Fan\u2019s friend. Can you put your mind to rest now? Then get in the car with me and I\u2019ll take you home.\u201d</p><br/><p>Actually, Pei Yuyang also had unspeakable bitter suffering because of Qi Zhifan, this close friend with an eccentric temperament. This early in the night, didn\u2019t he care about whether Pei Yuyang was enjoying a village\u2019s gentle pleasure? With a phone call, he made him rush eight hundred miles to hurry over here.</p><br/><p><i>Since you already knew your older brother was in trouble, why didn\u2019t you go save him yourself? </i>Why did he have to rush over from so far away, and waste so much effort. This person was really proud and arrogant.</p><br/><p>Following Pei Yuyang into the car, Wei Han didn\u2019t sit in the passenger seat and directly sat in the backseat. Who knew that when his butt fell down, a clear, cold voice floated out next to him, \u201cHow are you so slow. You can really dawdle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fuck, the frightened Wei Han shivered. This man had left earlier. How come he\u2019s still here?</p><br/><p>\u201cAiyo, good Ah Fan, this can\u2019t be blamed on me. Who told your brother to be so heavily vigilant.\u201d Pei Yuyang driving in front, couldn\u2019t help but complain.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan\u2019s eyes fell on Wei Han. He looked at his messy clothes and the bruises on his arms, but fortunately, they weren\u2019t too serious.</p><br/><p>He saw that his \u201colder brother\u201d Wei Han obviously already knew that he\u2019d been merciful and asked his friend to rescue him, but he didn\u2019t seem to have any reaction, not even a \u201cthank you\u201d. Qi Zhifan felt growing traces of displeasure.</p><br/><p>\u201cWei Han, I\u2019ve clearly warned you before. In the end, you amazingly still followed me today.\u201d Without waiting for a response, Qi Zhifan spoke on, \u201cThis time you got the little lesson that you deserved. Later on, you\u23bc\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrr\u2026\u201d a strange sound echoed.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrumble, rumble\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s stomach growled at this time. The driving Pei Yuyang \u201cpfft\u201d laughed, and the interrupted Qi Zhifan narrowed his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t glare at me, I can\u2019t control it. Can\u2019t I be hungry? I haven\u2019t eaten for hours. I was just beaten until I threw up my morning meal, even throwing up stomach acid. I almost don\u2019t even have bile to spit out\u2026\u201d Wei Han rubbed his stomach. Fortunately his skin was still thick and able to endure a beating.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll immediately find a place to park and get you something to eat at the convenience store nearby,\u201d the amused Pei Yuyang kindly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need, no need.\u201d Wei Han waved his hand and glanced at Qi Zhifan, \u201cI can\u2019t waste little brother Gavin\u2019s valuable time. I\u2019ll cook noodles to eat when I get home.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing this, Qi Zhifan lips pressed tighter.</p><br/><p>So, close to eleven o\u2019clock in the evening, Pei Yuyang sent Wei Han and Qi Zhifan back to their home, accompanied from time to time by the \u201cgrumbling\u201d sound.</p><br/><p>Once they arrived downstairs, Wei Han thanked Pei Yuyang, and then he quickly ran upstairs.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, your brother isn\u2019t only amusing, but he also seems very mensao. This thing\u2026\u201d Pei Yuyang smiled meaningfully and directly threw something that Wei Han had dropped in the car to Qi Zhifan. \u201cHey, take it, and remember to give it back to your brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan held the hot pink thong and his brows quickly furrowed\u2026</p><br/><p><b>The author has something to say: </b>Author: It\u2019s a pink thong, eh, or a Tintin pink?</p><br/><p>Panties: Later, people will have a great use for ~\\ (\u2267\u25bd\u2266)/~ la la la~</p><br/><p><b>Notes</b></p><ul><li>Wulan Tuoya \u2013 Horse Harness ( \u23bc ) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM2w6MzMsac</li><li>mensao (): outwardly cold, but deeply passionate inside</li></ul><hr/><div><div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

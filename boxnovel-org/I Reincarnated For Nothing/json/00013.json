13 - The Link Between You and I (1)</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At first, Artpe couldn\u2019t fathom how the Dungeon and Skeletons were connected through the Record Link.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, it was simple once he understood it. \u00a0From the beginning, the Record Link was over the entire Dungeon\u2026 \u00a0To be more precise, when the requirement for destroying the Elite Skeleton Warrior was met, a field was placed over the Dungeon. \u00a0Everything within the Dungeon was placed within its sphere of influence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Usually, it was impossible to synchronize all the monsters, yet this method had allowed the impossible to become possible. \u00a0This field also allowed the Dungeon\u2019s monsters to change the structure of the Dungeon using their will. \u00a0They merged the separated space, and it allowed them to send forth countless number of monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe had realized this fact before it was too late. \u00a0Of course, even if he realized it, there wasn\u2019t much he could do at this point in time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was normal to have no options in such a situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHowever, I\u2019m an abnormality.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if Artpe couldn\u2019t cancel the Record Link in its entirety, he could push and distort the enormous magic spell using his Mana. \u00a0It was possible to cause a minute amount of change.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why he was using his Mana Control ability to its limit as he spliced small parts of the Record Link using his Mana. \u00a0Then he rejoined the split ends in different configurations to set small restriction.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He tied off the part of the region considered to be the 6th floor of the Dungeons. \u00a0Afterwards, he tied off the 7th floor, then he moved on to tie the next region below\u2026..</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why there was no change occurring to the Dungeon now. \u00a0Of course, all the monsters on the same floor were still connected through the Record Link. \u00a0However, at the very least, the outer appearance of the Dungeon had returned to looking like any other normal Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe fact that it\u2019ll be difficult to smash through this Dungeon hasn\u2019t changed, but we no longer have to fear about our stamina running out by fighting against an unknown number of reinforcements. \u00a0Moreover, the Record Link to the other Skeletons on the other floors was completely severed\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf it is as you\u2019ve said, does this perhaps mean\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are pretty quick on the uptake.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe met Maetel\u2019s sparkling eyes, and he smirked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAfter we disable their ability to move, we can kill all of the Skeletons on this floor.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeletons here had been isolated from the others. \u00a0The ridiculous concept that they couldn\u2019t gain any EXP until they cleared the entire Dungeon was gone now. \u00a0They would no longer have to suffer under such crazy and tortuous stricture.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were still under the difficult restriction where they had to disable all the monsters on a single floor without killing the monsters. \u00a0However, it didn\u2019t feel onerous to the two heroes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They\u2019ll win. \u00a0They will survive to become stronger. \u00a0It didn\u2019t matter who tried to test them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn't care about the reasons behind such tests. \u00a0He would take them all. \u00a0If he was at a test site, he would upend it. \u00a0If he was in a prison, he would destroy it. \u00a0If it was a kingdom, he would raze it to the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe aren\u2019t obligated to play on a stage made by the enemy. \u00a0Remember that, Maetel. \u00a0The enemies should dance to our music. \u00a0We are the ones that have to survive after defeating our enemies. \u00a0It doesn\u2019t matter if they call us cheap. \u00a0They can even cuss us out for being the bad guys.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the philosophy of survival developed by the Four Heavenly King Artpe Hirtana Kelduke of the Demon King\u2019s army. \u00a0In his previous life, he had merely been an extra that should have been killed off early in the story. \u00a0However, he had been able to stay alive until the hero invaded the Demon King\u2019s castle. \u00a0This was the reason why.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, he was dispatched by the radiant hero, but she was by his side now. \u00a0Nothing would be impossible for the two of them. \u00a0Even if it was impossible, they would make it possible.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe fact that we survive is us winning. \u00a0That is why we have to survive to win. The most important thing is our own survival. \u00a0There is nothing worth more than that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c....Yes..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel firmly nodded her head. \u00a0Of course, she was was born with a strong sense of justice. \u00a0She was too innocent to understand the selfishness and spite he had developed by surviving through the long years.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Still, this would be enough. \u00a0She wouldn\u2019t be easily swindled by others now. \u00a0He had created a foundation he could build on.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[W...what the hell is this.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Koo-ahhhhhhhhhhh!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeletons were having a hard time accepting the fact that an outsider had changed the entire layout of the Dungeon. \u00a0How long had they been waiting for this moment! \u00a0How patient had they been! \u00a0They had been eagerly waiting for this as they hated every moment of the wait!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had even allowed themselves to become lowly Undead to protect this place. \u00a0They had placed their worth in protecting the place. \u00a0This was their shining moment, yet these little brats were treating them like trash! \u00a0The little brats had spit on them! \u00a0It was a twisted situation where they were being looked down on!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[This is wrong! \u00a0They won't be able to prove their worth this way! \u00a0They will only just get stronger!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You are making a mistake! \u00a0You don\u2019t possess the necessary qualification!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou guys should all shut up. \u00a0If this qualification involves us being accepted by such rotten Skeletons, I would rather not have it! \u00a0I care not for it! \u00a0Maetel!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNone of you will be able to run away!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His Magic was running smoothly, so he just had to focus on Maetel and his shield. \u00a0Artpe was able to bolster Maetel\u2019s power as he freely controlled his shield. \u00a0He attacked the flustered group of Skeletons.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[How can this\u2026. \u00a0Koohk!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[These bastards don\u2019t have the right to take the test. We\u2019ll kill you! \u00a0We\u2019ll destroy you!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeletons had been shaken when an abnormality occurred in their Record Link, so they weren\u2019t able to properly react to the situation. \u00a0However, they had now accepted the truth that they would have to defeat Artpe and Maetel with the troops on this floor. \u00a0They strengthened the Record Link between each other, and they started actively attacking the two heroes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Maetel was getting stronger even at this moment as she participated in the battle. \u00a0This was why the Skeletons weren\u2019t in a favorable position.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t as if the Skeletons had gone easy on them from the beginning, because it was a test. \u00a0Nothing would change from their adjusted attitude!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Are you planning on imitating a boomerang with your shoddy shield? \u00a0It is too heavy! \u00a0It looks like a pig rolling across the ground!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat the hell are you looking at! \u00a0That is only an after-image!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Koo-ahhhhhhk!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He hadn\u2019t wanted to grow in this direction, but Artpe\u2019s ability to throw the shield\u2026 \u00a0No, the ability to control it was growing in real time. \u00a0He was providing Maetel with Mana. \u00a0Was he receiving some of her stamina and reflexes in return?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Several dozen Mana Threads were extended from his one hand, and they were used to control the shield. \u00a0The sharp edge of the shield, which could inflict the curse, was raised. \u00a0It flew freely across the large hallway as it impacted the Skeletons\u2019 bodies in order. \u00a0The damage it inflicted wasn\u2019t light.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHere and here!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The bastard\u2019s shield is weakening us.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[We have to catch and kill him. \u00a0We have to kill\u2026.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As time passed, Artpe\u2019s shield flew faster, and it rotated more sharply. \u00a0He was inflicting damage on par with Maetel\u2019s bastard sword. \u00a0The Skeletons had been afraid of Maetel, so they had been herded towards him. \u00a0However, he was taking them down faster as time passed, and he finally realized something.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018What is this? \u00a0What the hell is happening? \u00a0I\u2019m satisfied with just being able to push and keep others in check. \u00a0\u00a0What is the deal with this? \u00a0How is it possible for me to dominate foes that are 20 levels higher than me? \u00a0If I make a mistake, I might kill them outright\u2026. Moreover, I think the curse effect has gotten stronger.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe reflected on why this was so. \u00a0\u00a0He realized that the act of infusing Mana into the shield was slowly strengthening the shield\u2019s special characteristic.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was on an another level compared to simply infusing a rock in an attempt to make it explode. \u00a0He had used his Mana to increase the performance of the Artifact at a fundamental level. \u00a0Basically, he had used [Reinforcement].</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In other words, it was a special rare Support type skill. \u00a0He didn\u2019t have to say it out loud, but this was a hellishly difficult skill to learn.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018....when and how did I learn this skill?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What did he actually do to precipitate this? \u00a0He had caused change on the Record Link casted on the entire Dungeon. \u00a0He knew he had done a pretty good job, but this act and the reinforcing of the shield was part of an entirely different discipline.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The only thing else he had done was establishing the Mana link with Maetel. \u00a0He had poured Mana into her, and he had busily thrown his shield around.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Koo-ahhhhhhhhhhhh!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The shield\u2026 \u00a0The shield is getting larger! \u00a0It is starting to rotate!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Dodge it. \u00a0The bastard isn\u2019t trying to kill us! \u00a0He is just trying to inflict pain! \u00a0The bastard is not a hero! \u00a0He is the devil! \u00a0His wickedness is almost on par with the Four Heavenly Kings under the Demon King!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was as if they knew about his past occupation as one of the Four Heavenly Kings. \u00a0The Skeletons kept spouting impudent words, so he thought about mowing them down with his shield.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I\u2019m awakening to skills at a ridiculous level. \u00a0This should only be possible for Maetel\u2026. \u00a0Wait a moment. \u00a0When I used the link on Maetel, maybe Mana wasn\u2019t the only thing that was shared between us?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His body was moving more swiftly, and he had easily acquired a skill he hadn\u2019t possessed before. \u00a0\u00a0Maybe this spell didn\u2019t simply link their Mana. \u00a0He might have created something more grand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At this point, he wanted to check his ability using his Read All Creation skill, and he was annoyed that he didn\u2019t have the spare time to do so. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Still, if my theory is correct, Maetel\u2019s aptitude is being shared with me.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a very dangerous occurrence for him. \u00a0Maetel was supposed to become the most brilliant hero in history using her talent. \u00a0This talent was being shared with Artpe, who was of mediocre talents. \u00a0This would throw a big wrench in his plan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This would slow down Maetel\u2019s growth, and there was a chance that Artpe might pass her. \u00a0Then the enemy\u2019s gaze might focus more on him. \u00a0Something terrible such as that might occur to him!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If possible, he had planned on maintaining the Mana link indefinitely. \u00a0However, this changed the story. \u00a0After the battle ended, he would get a clear assessment of himself using his Read All Creation ability. \u00a0Then he planned on severing the Mana link as soon as possible.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The brightest star had to be Maetel.\u00a0 Artpe didn\u2019t want to shine brighter than her. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Basically, the act of emitting light is like a work out. \u00a0I\u2019m too lazy to work out.. \u00a0After I receive enough light from Maetel, I\u2019ll just reflect the light. \u00a0That will be sufficient.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was a mindset unbefitting of a hero. \u00a0However, his previous occupation was being one of the Four Heavenly Kings, and he had always dreamed about living the life as a dairy farmer! \u00a0He was able to come up with such possibilities, because he was Artpe!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel didn\u2019t even realize what was going through his thoughts. \u00a0She diligently moved her body. \u00a0Even now she was efficiently pulling Artpe\u2019s bountiful Mana towards her for her use. \u00a0She was getting stronger even at this moment!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-ahhhhhhhhhhhp!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Strong. \u00a0They are too strong!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[We need more reinforcement\u2026. \u00a0\u00a0Aht! \u00a0We don\u2019t have any!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Maetel]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Level : 32]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Swordsmanship Lv8]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Berserk Lv4]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Mana Control Lv6]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFrom the looks of it, it doesn\u2019t look like her talent had decreased at all\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe mumbled bitterly as he waved his hand. \u00a0The last reinforcement added before the 6th floor was isolated stepped forward. \u00a0The highest level among the group was 55. \u00a0They hesitatingly moved towards the two.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You, who explore the domain of the impossible, shall face either creation or destruction at the end of this chaos. \u00a0We will test your small body...kuhk!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStop giving a monologue, and fight me!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[How dareeeeeeeee you\u2026 \u00a0Kah-ahk!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two heroes had a lot to think about, yet the Skeleton with an empty skull was spouting philosophical words! \u00a0It was merely an extra, yet it was trying to act cool. \u00a0Even if the creator forgave such actions, Artpe wouldn\u2019t forgive them!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll of you fuck off! \u00a0If you know what is good for you, you should separate your head from your body! \u00a0Just roll around on the floor!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[How dare you sully our noble resolve\u2026 \u00a0Kahk!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One Skeleton in particular was filled with rage. \u00a0It had tried to speak, yet the edge of Artpe\u2019s shield impacted on its body. \u00a0The Skeleton was thrown to the Dungeon\u2019s wall.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even after impacting on the Skeleton, the shield didn\u2019t lose any momentum. \u00a0It attacked three additional Skeletons. \u00a0Then it violently revolved around Artpe to fend off the Skeletons trying to swing their swords towards him. \u00a0The shield was even able to break their weapons.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. \u00a0This should be enough.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He would be able to prevail over this situation without asking a favor of Maetel. \u00a0The Skeletons that had been crowding around him were mostly defeated. \u00a0He nodded in satisfaction when he checked that less than 100 Skeletons were left.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I will not open the way for such wicked beings!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[We have to defeat them. \u00a0I\u2019ll make them into Skeletons!

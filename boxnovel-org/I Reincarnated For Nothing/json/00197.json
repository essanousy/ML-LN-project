\u00a0You\u2019ve already experienced it once before?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIn our past lives, many things went in favor of the Demon King instead of the hero.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe\u2019s past life was the record of a loser, but at the same time, the hero\u2019s party had lost too. \u00a0It was also the record of their defeat. \u00a0He added nothing and he concealed nothing as he told the events</span></p><br/><p><span>He told how the hero\u2019s party was formed. \u00a0Everything was different from their current life. \u00a0The Demon King\u2019s army had used a different strategy in attacking the human realm. \u00a0The hero\u2019s party couldn\u2019t stop the corruption within Paladia. \u00a0He told them about Vadinet\u2019s love for Silpennon, and the destruction that arose from that love. \u00a0He spoke about the hero\u2019s relationship with the other human nations. \u00a0He told them about the war, and the battle against Artpe\u2026. \u00a0\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>He told them about his demise.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt really was a shit show.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes, it was a shit show. \u00a0I was the enemy of the human race, but even I could see how hopeless the humans could be as a race. \u00a0That is the reason why I hid Maetel in the beginning. \u00a0 This is old news, but I\u2019ll make a shocking confession. \u00a0In truth, the meal that we\u2019ve had up until now was better than the meal that would have been provided by the palace.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cArtpe is a con artist.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Maetel laughed as she spoke mischievously. \u00a0There was also a faint smile on Artpe\u2019s lips. \u00a0The fact that they were able to laugh together was quite amazing.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s my story. \u00a0I don\u2019t have firsthand knowledge as to what happened to the world after I died.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI guess it\u2019s my turn.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Silpennon took up the baton. \u00a0He told them about his encounter with one of the former Four Heavenly King, and how he had recovered his memories. \u00a0He told them about what had occurred up until the point of his death. \u00a0He wondered if it would have better if he hadn't told this story. \u00a0It was a miserable story. \u00a0Still, everything became clear now.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBasically, a secret boss has to be killed after defeating the Demon King. \u00a0However, the secret boss was able to operate from the beginning when Artpe rewound the history of the world. \u00a0Basically, that\u2019s what happened.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWe defeated most of our enemies, but the previous Demon King remains to be defeated. \u00a0That still remain the same.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI see. \u00a0That is why\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019m still having a hard time accepting it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Vadinet had a sour look on her face.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHow could I like such a man as him?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019ll fight you later on. \u00a0I won\u2019t go easy on you, because you are a woman.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is such a mysterious feeling. \u00a0I wonder what I was like in that world.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Sienna absentmindedly thought about her other self in the previous world. \u00a0In the end, she just nodded her head as she smiled.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019m thankful that oppa was born as a human. \u00a0I don\u2019t think I can imagine a life without you, oppa.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for Artpe, the world would have ended.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe just let out a bitter laughter when he saw Sienna and Maetel\u2019s reaction. \u00a0He had been a Four Heavenly King, and he had fought against Maetel, who had been the hero. \u00a0Despite knowing all of this, their reaction was quite mild. \u00a0It even made him question if he had been worried over nothing. \u00a0Maybe, he was the weird one.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019m fine since I\u2019m able to love Artpe-nim now. \u00a0It is also fortunate that I avoided dying a dog\u2019s death in this life.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cArtpe, may I hit that woman once? \u00a0Just once.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou should be quiet.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>When he came to his senses, he realized Maetel was already holding his hand. \u00a0Maetel was smiling at him as if she had accepted everything. \u00a0Artpe was about to say something, but he gave up. \u00a0He thought it was no longer important. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIs that it? \u00a0Is that all you feel?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is such a ridiculous story that I\u2019m half in disbelief. \u00a0Truthfully, even if the story is true, my attitude towards you won\u2019t change.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Elrick had spoken up. \u00a0As one of the male members of the party, he was able to give the most objective opinion. \u00a0It was also the reason why Artpe could trust his words the most. \u00a0In the corner of Artpe\u2019s heart, there had always been a tight ball of worry, and he finally felt it loosen.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIf I heard that story before I met Artpe-nim, I might have a different opinion. \u00a0However, aren\u2019t we trying to return the Demon realm into a human realm right now? \u00a0If so, can\u2019t we just say that you were the first Demon to be turned back into human? \u00a0That is also the reason why you were given the power of the magic tome. \u00a0If I think of it that way, I can accept it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUh\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Vadinet was completely in love with Artpe, so Artpe had expected her to spout some nonsense that would be in favor of Artpe. \u00a0However, her words were pretty compelling. \u00a0When he heard her words, an idea flashed in his mind. \u00a0However, it went away quickly.</span></p><br/><p><span>There was one sure thing that had come out of this. \u00a0The scenario that Artpe had been most worried about hadn\u2019t come to pass. \u00a0Emotions washed over him. \u00a0He didn\u2019t know if it was a sense of shame or relief. \u00a0He just swept away all those emotions.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI feel like an idiot for suffering under the weight of this burden for so long. \u00a0Thank you for sharing your opinions.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe fact that Artpe-nim is capable of suffering is more surprising to me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cShut up, ajumma.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019m not an ajumma!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He was grumbling, but he would be lying if he said that he wasn\u2019t deeply moved by all their words. \u00a0His inner limit on how much embarrassment he could stand was surpassed. \u00a0He immediately laid down on the floor, and he pushed his hood down over his face.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019m just saying. \u00a0I thought you guys would be less upset hearing it from me rather than hearing it from the previous Demon King. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t as if I thought your attitudes would change. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t as if I didn\u2019t trust you all. \u00a0I just want you guys to know this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cArtpe-nim has a really cute side.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cShut up.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7shocked.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Regina\u2019s emotions were the most difficult to assess compared to the others. \u00a0She was the last one to open her mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cArtpe was older than me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI wondered why you weren\u2019t saying anything about it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019m younger than you physically and mentally. \u00a0I\u2019m in a very dangerous situation.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou are extremely safe. \u00a0Extremely.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAll your odd actions in the past makes sense now. \u00a0 From now on, I\u2019ll consider it a potential risk factor.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe wondered if he should play along with her. \u00a0However, he gave up on that idea. \u00a0He didn\u2019t need his relationship with women to get more complicated right now. \u00a0Regina was a bit miffed when he didn\u2019t play along. \u00a0She kept poking him with her staff, yet he ignored her until the end.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018I have to stop her from talking about me liking younger women\u2026...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>He thought about saying something, but in the end, Artpe just fell asleep.</span></p><br/><p><span>In truth, he had been the one that had been the most overextended in the battle against the Demon King and the Fragment of the Demonic god. \u00a0Of course, he was the moe tired than anyone in his party. \u00a0He had told them everything about his previous life, and the fact that he had not collapsed afterwards from exhaustion was a miracle in itself.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cArtpe fell asleep.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHmmm.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Maetel quickly moved to snipe the position beside Artpe. \u00a0Sienna was as quick as Maetel. \u00a0She positioned herself on the other side.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cLet\u2019s sleep too.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou guys really have excellent timing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cArtpe doesn\u2019t yield it up to us, so we have no choice but to take it from him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHowever, I now have some idea as to why he\u2019s like that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Maetel and Sienna guarded his sides. \u00a0Vadinet pushed through the narrow space to position herself near Artpe\u2019s head. Artpe had fallen asleep, and he had a peaceful expression on his face. \u00a0Vadinet was very careful as she put his head on her thighs, and she gently touched his hair.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019m sure this is why Artpe-nim has been so hesitant. \u00a0He inwardly felt that he was a different person from what we viewed him as. \u00a0That is why he wasn\u2019t confident in being able to accept our feelings at face value.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNormally, you sound like an ignoramus. \u00a0You sounded somewhat like a holy priestess right now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cShut up.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Vadinet sounded sullen when she gave her retort. \u00a0However, the smile on her lips didn\u2019t fade.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI now know why he\u2019s been holding back. \u00a0Now I can be at ease. \u00a0I can pursue him for real.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou haven\u2019t been pursuing him for real until now!?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Her \u00a0words were more surprising than the story told by Artpe today! \u00a0Vadinet looked at her competitors with guarded eyes, but she remained in place.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou plan on staying like that all night?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI will do so if Artpe-nim can rest in comfort. \u00a0It is as Artpe-nim had said\u2026. \u00a0Tomorrow will be a long day.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was as if her words drained them of energy. \u00a0The whole party came to a consensus without speaking a single word. \u00a0They all sprawled out on the floor. \u00a0They were all tired. \u00a0For the next several hours, no one was bothered them. \u00a0They were greeted by peace and silence.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe awoke the next day, and he felt unusually refreshed. \u00a0He thought he had been lying on the floor, but his head was being supported by something soft and warm. \u00a0He felt around, and he realized that he was touching someone\u2019s thighs. \u00a0He became more surprised when he found out that the owner of the thighs was Vadinet.</span></p><br/><p><span>Despite having Artpe\u2019s head on her thighs, she didn\u2019t look uncomfortable. \u00a0Sse was sleeping with a faint smile on her face. \u00a0It bothered him that this was the most brightest and pure smile he had seen on her face.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018Why is she doing this? \u00a0Until now, she never initiated contact until I gave her permission.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>He wondered if he had been worried about the wrong thing. \u00a0After telling them his story yesterday, he wondered if he had called forth trouble from an entirely different direction. \u00a0He had been worried about them rejecting him, but this change was worrying too.</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe let out a bitter laughter as he tried to get up. \u00a0However, he couldn't\u2019 move his body. \u00a0Maetel and Sienna was stuck to his sides. \u00a0Etna and Mycenae was holding onto his thighs. \u00a0It was as if someone had casted an Immobility spell on him. \u00a0He couldn\u2019t move.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDangerous man.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Regina was observing it all.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7do something. \u00a0Don\u2019t just stand there looking at me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe act of approaching you is dangerous. \u00a0It is more beneficial to observe the pattern where the bugs fall into a trap.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAlright. \u00a0I\u2019m sorry for ignoring you yesterday. \u00a0I fell asleep. \u00a0It couldn\u2019t be helped.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7accepted\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Regina pouted as she swung her staff. \u00a0She slowly separated the girls from him. \u00a0He sat up, and he found out that everyone was still sound asleep.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIs it ok not to wake them up? \u00a0I would like to hasten the humanification of the Demon realm. \u00a0The faster it is done the better it would be.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is more important for our party members to regain their normal physical and mental status. \u00a0If we exit this place, we won\u2019t be able to rest for awhile.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7agreed.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Regina quietly nodded her head as she approached him. \u00a0She sat down next to him. \u00a0He wondered why she was doing this.</span></p><br/><p><span>She spoke with a sincere voice.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI want to hear about my past life. \u00a0I want the details. \u00a0I want to hear how you came to know about me in my past life.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt isn\u2019t a happy story. \u00a0Are you sure?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIf I want to be happy in the future, I have to go through with this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a wise answer to a stupid question. \u00a0Artpe smirked as he opened his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOk. \u00a0I'll tell you about it. \u00a0Still, I hope you won\u2019t hate the humans too much after hearing this story.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cEven if some of the humans did me wrong, I won\u2019t be incredibly foolish in hating the whole human race. \u00a0You are worrying over nothing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes, you really are like that. \u00a0Jeez.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Even in her past life, Regina had stuck with Maetel until the end as a member of the hero\u2019s party. \u00a0Maybe, he had been worrying needlessly. \u00a0Artpe nodded his head at her words, and he spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIn my past life, the incident between the Elves and the Magic Kingdom turned out much nastier\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The conversation between the two of them ended when the other party members started to wake up. \u00a0Regina had taken a step back yesterday, so the girls were shocked when they saw her next to Artpe. \u00a0They never expected her to use such a high level tactic. \u00a0Regina stood her ground with an impassive face.</span></p><br/><p><span>This was how Artpe had revealed all the story he had kept hidden. \u00a0He didn\u2019t leave any loose ends behind that could cause any confusions in the future.</span></p><br/><p><span>The hero\u2019s party headed towards the final battlefield. \u00a0</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

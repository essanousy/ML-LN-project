font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">As expected, Artpe had guessed correctly on what the Demon King had wanted to do. \u00a0The Demon King was trying to get rid of the collar around his neck. \u00a0He was trying to use Artpe\u2019s Reclamation magic for his own end. \u00a0He was trying to shed the body of a Demon! \u00a0After he shed his Demonhood, he planned on defeating Artpe\u2019s party and the previous Demon King. \u00a0He probably wanted to become the ruler of the new world.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cNo. \u00a0I\u2019m sending you off from this place.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Of course, Artpe didn\u2019t care what the Demon King intended to do. \u00a0He just shut his eyes as he swung his staff.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Mana rose from Artpe, and he used the magic tome to complete a massive spell. \u00a0The Reclamation magic was turning the Demonic energy within the Demon King into Mana! \u00a0The spell was drawn deep within the Demon King\u2019s body, and Artpe instantly took ahold of the spell. \u00a0He used the Materialization magic on top of the Reclamation spell.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">[\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7koohk!?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">The Reclamation magic had already been completed, but it started to change. \u00a0The spell, which had been changing the Demon King\u2019s soul and Mana, stopped in its progress. \u00a0It started to let out a light so bright that it could be described as being harsh. \u00a0The light started to resonate with Artpe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">This was none other than the light spell called Hero\u2019s Flash! \u00a0It was a spell that only the hero was allowed to use!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">[Koo-ha-ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">It was akin to being poisoned after taking a potion. \u00a0The Demon King took on the attack head on as he coughed out black blood from his mouth. \u00a0Up until now, the Demon King hadn\u2019t shown any outward sign of pain when he was attacked. \u00a0This was the first time he had received a critical wound.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">[Kuhk, kuh-hoohk\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">It was to be expected. \u00a0The Demon King had willingly accepted the Mana into his body, and at that moment, the Mana had turned against him. \u00a0How could one prepare for such an eventuality? \u00a0How was he supposed to heal from this? \u00a0The Demon King realized that what he had aimed for had turned out to be the ultimate trap. \u00a0For the first time, the Demon King had to admit that he had lost in a battle of wits and craftiness.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">[Artpe, are you perhaps\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">[Ah. \u00a0You don\u2019t have to go through the trouble of finishing that sentence. \u00a0You probably want to say, \u2018Are you perhaps able to change the nature of the spell on top of changing its structure?\u2018 and \u2018What do you gain by taking control of a magic that I\u2019ve already absorbed into my body?\u2019 \u00a0I\u2019m fed up with you speaking.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">The Demon King didn\u2019t even have the time to point out anything since Artpe had already said everything the Demon King wanted to say. \u00a0Artpe twisted his hand, and the power of the Hero\u2019s Flash condensed within the Demon King\u2019s body. \u00a0The staff let out a fierce light as it heightened the energy of the spell.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">In layman's terms, the Demon King was an ice that had been swallowed up by fire.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">[You acquired\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u00a0A very dangerous power\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">The Demon King spoke as he tried to expel the fatal and poisonous energy through his mouth. \u00a0This was not the Reclamation magic where the Demonic energy was purified into Mana. \u00a0The Demonic energy was treated as an absolute evil, and the Hero\u2019s Flash started extinguishing it in its entirety. \u00a0The quality of his Demonic energy degraded significantly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Moreover, the Reclamation magic was stopped in mid-process. \u00a0The Demonic energy, which was in the midst of being purified into Mana, was torn between becoming Demonic energy and Mana. \u00a0It started to eat away at its owner from the inside. \u00a0The Demon King was being destroyed so suddenly and thoroughly that he almost laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">According to the knowledge and the power he possessed, he had no idea how to recover from this wound. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Artpe continued to look at the Demon King.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">The Demon King spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">[Magic is nature. \u00a0You guys tried to change magic at a fundamental level. \u00a0You changed a blooming flower into a rock, and a cloud into a volcano. \u00a0Soon, you will realize this. \u00a0You started walking down the road traversed by gods\u2026. \u00a0 Are you able to handle that truth?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">[That is none of my business.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">[You still don\u2019t realize the weight of the power you have gained. \u00a0If I had such power\u2026.. \u00a0 Ha ha. \u00a0I was always prideful of the fact that I was the strongest. \u00a0I\u2019ve fallen so far, and it happened when the new world is about to arrive. \u00a0If I told this to my past self, he would have burst out laughing!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">The Demon King was still verbose. \u00a0Artpe and Etna knew what that meant.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">The Demon King still had something up his sleeve.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">[All the Demonic energy\u2026 \u00a0Obey me.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">The Demon King had realized that his plan had gone awry. \u00a0He spoke those words quietly, and the entire Dungeon started to shake. \u00a0Artpe\u2019s party tried to regain their balance, so they lost sight of the Demon King for a brief moment. \u00a0The Demon King took out an Artifact from a pocket, and he stabbed it into his heart. \u00a0It was an Artifact that changed Mana into Demonic energy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">The Artifact quickly stuck to his heart as it sucked in all the Demon King\u2019s Demonic energy. \u00a0 A dark light was emitted each time his heart beat, and it was a frightening sight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">[However, it isn\u2019t enough, Artpe. \u00a0You were found lacking. \u00a0You weren\u2019t able to optimize the use of your ability, and it\u2019ll be the reason for your loss. \u00a0It\u2019ll be an albatross that\u2019ll hang around your neck.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Overwhelming Demonic energy kept overlapping each other! \u00a0Hero\u2019s Flash and the Reclamation magic needed Mana as a foundation for it to work. \u00a0As the Demon King synced with the Artifact, everything became dyed with Demonic energy. \u00a0In the end, Artpe\u2019s spells lost their power. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">If the Demon King\u2019s power took shape again, this might really be the end. \u00a0Artpe firmly bit his lips as he had this thought. \u00a0It seemed he couldn\u2019t overcome the Demon King by himself. \u00a0Of course, Artpe couldn\u2019t hide his disgust at this fact.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">[However\u2026.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">In the end, a cool smile appeared on his lips.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">[When are you going to realize that this isn\u2019t a one on one fight between the two of us?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">[What\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">The Demon King was speaking when he staggered on his feet. \u00a0The Demonic energy had been under his control as it swelled up, yet it suddenly withered away. \u00a0Even his consciousness was turning dim.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">[You bastard\u2026..]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cGoodbye.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Someone was behind the Demon King. \u00a0 He had stabbed his dual daggers into the Demon King\u2019s chest from the back. \u00a0In one fell swoop, the Demon King\u2019s heart and the Artifact fused to it was destroyed. \u00a0The young man moved his daggers back and forth as he destroyed the Demon King\u2019s internal organs.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">He was decisive and merciless. \u00a0It was to be expected of someone that had stabbed Artpe to death in his past life. \u00a0However, Silpennon\u2019s cold-blooded daggers were on Artpe\u2019s side now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cAs expected, you still didn't notice me. \u00a0That is why you are a loser, you son of a bitch.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Technically, it was all thanks to Silpennon\u2019s Innate ability called Plunder. \u00a0For a short amount of time, he had stolen Aria\u2019s Assimilation ability. \u00a0He had been completely hidden, and he had ambushed the Demon King at the perfect moment. \u00a0Silpennon unloaded the words he had wanted to drop on the Demon King. \u00a0He was similar to Artpe in that aspect. \u00a0He was a vicious person that wanted his enemies to feel bad.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">[You were able to hide even from from my eyes. \u00a0You are merely a minor character, yet\u2026. \u00a0 Koohk, koo-koohk. \u00a0Koo-ha-ha-ha-ha!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">In the midst of his speech, the Demon King fell to ground. \u00a0There was laughter on his lips as he rolled around on the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">[AHhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">This made him feel much better. \u00a0 Their attacks hadn\u2019t been flashy, but it had been very effective. \u00a0In the end, the Demon King accepted the result. \u00a0When he accepted this fact, he could accept someone else being the main character of this stage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">He raised his head with difficulty. \u00a0He met Artpe\u2019s challenging gaze. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Ah ah. \u00a0It seemed being a Demon had been a shackle in itself. \u00a0Artpe had shed this shackle, and he was glowing brighter than ever. \u00a0He opened his mouth to speak.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">[This was truly fun. \u00a0I\u2019m satisfied.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">At this moment, Artpe sensed that something was wrong. \u00a0The Demon King\u2019s body was a mess, yet a hidden reservoir of Demonic energy arose from within him. \u00a0It quickly started to rev up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cYou fight dirty until the end!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Silpennon had been trying to apply additional attacks to the Demon King. \u00a0Artpe desperately called him back with a sharp voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">[You are the Demon King, yet you are thinking about blowing yourself up!?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">[I\u2019m not going to do that. \u00a0Both of us didn\u2019t subject ourselves to the restriction of time. \u00a0Either you or I have to advance from this place.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">The Demon King had been hit with the Hero\u2019s Flash, Reclamation spell and Silpennon\u2019s strike. \u00a0The Demon King\u2019s Demonic energy had been extinguished. \u00a0He had suffered a critical wound where he could no longer maintain his body and soul. \u00a0Either he had to choose to accept his death or he had to consume the rest of his Demonic energy to attack Artpe\u2019s party.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">He chose to do neither. \u00a0He expelled both Demonic energy and Mana from his body. \u00a0He pushed out the Hero\u2019s Flash, and the Artifact piercing his heart. \u00a0Blood poured out from his body. \u00a0His blood started to create symbols. \u00a0He was trying to activate a spell by using his body as a magic circle!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cArtpe, we have to attack now!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">A bigger mess would be created if the spell was intentionally shut down! \u00a0This was a spell that couldn\u2019t be disturbed! \u00a0As expected of the Demon King, he used a spell that was befitting his station. \u00a0Artpe firmly bit into his lips as he gripped his magic tome.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">The Demon King continued to speak.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400;

font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">How should he describe what he was feeling?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

At that moment, Sienna brought down her hammer. \u00a0She had been been given the strength of her entire party, and she was able to crush one finger with her fierce attack. \u00a0As if she had been waiting for this, Maetel quickly snatched Sienna, and she retreated backwards with Sienna in tow.</span></p><br/><p><span>Afterwards, the enraged Demonic god\u2019s arm grasped the space around it. \u00a0While Artpe manifested his spells, he had been monitoring the arm\u2019s movement, form and energy. \u00a0The arm kept repeating the same grasping gesture, and Artpe realized that nothing was left behind in the space grasped by the hand. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>Everything within the space was gone. \u00a0Air, dust, Mana and even Demonic energy\u2026..</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cMy god\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>[Koo-goo-rooooooo-goo-ahhhhhhk!]</span></p><br/><p><span>The power didn\u2019t differentiate between Mana and Demonic energy. \u00a0It destroyed everything, and Artpe was sure that this was part of the arm\u2019s Innate ability. \u00a0It was the most simple and destructive Innate ability that Artpe had run across up until now!</span></p><br/><p><span>Even as Artpe saw it with his two eyes, he was having a hard time believing it. \u00a0How could so much power be given to such a creature! \u00a0 Its finger was crushed by Sienna when its Demonic energy was consumed, but it recovered from the damage. \u00a0In front of its Innate ability, the regenerative ability of the arm looked like childsplay.</span></p><br/><p><span>At that moment, dust settle atop Artpe\u2019s head. \u00a0He had been monitoring the ceiling with sharp eyes. \u00a0At long last, Artpe let out a shout.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe cave is collapsing. \u00a0Regina!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The arm was letting out too much Demonic energy. \u00a0Even though the Demon King had put his heart and soul into creating this Dungeon, it had reached its limit. \u00a0Regina used her cold air to temporarily stop the collapse of the cave. \u00a0Then she directed the large pieces of the ceiling to fall on top of the arm of the Demonic god. \u00a0She tried to damage it a little bit more.</span></p><br/><p><span>[Kee-haaaaaaaah!]</span></p><br/><p><span>A surprising fact was revealed thanks to her actions.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe rocks disappeared before they could get near the arm. \u00a0It didn\u2019t have to make that grasping motion!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt was a feint. \u00a0Its Innate ability can be activated without the hand making that grasping motion. \u00a0If it wasn\u2019t for Regina\u2026. \u00a0Shit. \u00a0Sienna! \u00a0Maetel! \u00a0Don\u2019t approach it until I can suppress its ability!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe busily moved his hands. \u00a0Several thousand strands of Mana Strings appeared from the tip of his fingers. \u00a0The Mana Strings kept changing direction as they expanded to fill the cave. \u00a0The Mana Strings stopped the charge of the arm.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKoohk!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The arm had charged forward as if it was going to swallow up the party alongside the cave. \u00a0However, the arm was stopped for now. \u00a0Artpe frowned.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis son of a bitch is sending its negative energy through my Mana\u2026..!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>When the arm\u2019s Demonic energy made contact with Artpe\u2019s Mana, a connection was formed. \u00a0A frightening image appeared within Artpe\u2019s mind, and a curse flowed into his mind. \u00a0It was intended to mess with Artpe\u2019s mind. \u00a0 It was trying to negate Artpe\u2019s spell.</span></p><br/><p><span>The arm possessed overwhelming Record, so Artpe had guessed that it had possessed more than one Innate ability. \u00a0He had been right. \u00a0As expected of a being called the Demonic god, it had splendid abilities!</span></p><br/><p><span>[Koo-goo-roo-rooooooooooo!]</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHa!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>However, the Mana Strings didn\u2019t melt under the assault of its Innate ability. \u00a0Artpe also wasn\u2019t lacking in terms of mental strength. \u00a0At the very least, it wouldn\u2019t work when Artpe\u2019s eyes were letting out the bright purple light. \u00a0It was truly an amazing attack that contaminated the mind of one\u2019s opponent. \u00a0Unfortunately, the arm had used it against the wrong opponent.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019m immune to attacks on my mind, bitch!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe didn\u2019t buckle under its mental attack. \u00a0He poured more Mana into his Mana Strings! \u00a0 Dozen layers turned into hundreds of layers. \u00a0The layers of Mana Strings stacked upon each other as it continued to stop the charge of the arm.</span></p><br/><p><span>When Etna took Artpe\u2019s hand, a bright fire ran along the strings, and the flame lit up the Demonic god\u2019s arm. \u00a0She had the blood of an Elemental, so she was weak against mental attacks. \u00a0However, she was just adding her power to Artpe\u2019s Mana. \u00a0She could accomplish this without succumbing to the mental attack.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIf we can\u2019t melee it\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>At this point, Maetel had correctly assessed the situation. \u00a0She moved on to her next attack. \u00a0She held her long sword instead of her bastard sword.</span></p><br/><p><span>The sword had the ability to compress and shoot out Mana. \u00a0Maetel preferred the bastard sword, so the long sword rarely got used now. \u00a0Despite this fact, the long sword had a top tier ability that allowed her to condense her Mana. \u00a0It was also possible to stop the sword from shooting out the condensed energy. \u00a0The condensed Mana became fixed to the sword!</span></p><br/><p><span>The Demonic god\u2019s arm was trapped by Artpe\u2019s Mana Strings, so it was barely moving. \u00a0She aimed for the weakest point on the arm. \u00a0She used Accelerate as she threw it towards the wrist joint. \u00a0She put all the power of her Innate ability, and the power granted to her by the Record Master into this deadly throw!</span></p><br/><p><span>The weapon was invaluable, yet she had basically used it as a one-off throwing weapon. \u00a0The party was close to being wiped out. \u00a0It was a desperate situation, so no one stopped her. \u00a0\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>[Koo-goo-goo-goo-gahhhhhhhh!]</span></p><br/><p><span>The arm of the Demonic god sensed the weapon flying towards it. \u00a0It tried to destroy the sword, but Artpe\u2019s Mana Strings desperately held back its ability. \u00a0It resisted against the Mana Strings as it let out a massive amount of Demonic energy. \u00a0The nearby region was destroyed as Demonic energy filled the cave!</span></p><br/><p><span>The Reclamation magic and Roa\u2019s Greed ability stopped the Demonic energy from reaching the party. \u00a0However, it couldn\u2019t stop the Demonic energy from changing the course of the sword. \u00a0When Maetel saw this, she tried to rush forward despite the risk of her mind becoming corrupted. \u00a0Artpe stepped forward before she could do so.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cMaterialization!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>In a flash, the long sword grew several dozen times larger. \u00a0The massive sword extinguished the Demonic energy in its vicinity, and it stabbed into the wrist joint. \u00a0The hand was severed at the wrist!</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWe did it!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWe aren\u2019t out of the woods yet! \u00a0G...get rid of the arm!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The severed arm and hand was in shock. \u00a0However, it started moving again in short order. \u00a0The handless arm was much larger than the hand, but Artpe didn\u2019t hesitate to attack it first. \u00a0He determined the Demonic energy of the Demonic god was nested within the arm. \u00a0The Demonic god\u2019s abilities was concentrated in the hand.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWe can\u2019t get rid of that easily. \u00a0First, we have to get rid of its arm since it supplies the hand with Demonic energy.!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>As he spoke, Artpe blocked the hand with his Mana Strings. \u00a0A more dense Demonic energy assaulted the ground and the ceiling. \u00a0The ceiling continued to decay as it threatened to fall atop the whole party. \u00a0Artpe\u2019s Mana String deflected the debris with his Mana Strings!</span></p><br/><p><span>It wasn\u2019t just that. \u00a0The giant long sword was still under the influence of the Materialization magic. \u00a0It slowly floated into the air then it shot towards the hand again.</span></p><br/><p><span>The Materialization had a special characteristic. \u00a0It took a lot of Mana to use it, but it barely used any Mana when trying to change and maintain the spell! \u00a0The Demonic god\u2019s hand became preoccupied by the enormous sword infused with powerful Mana. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>Maetel and Sienna had been waiting for that exact moment. \u00a0They charged forward. \u00a0Maetel gripped her bastard sword as she climbed atop the flailing arm. \u00a0She started degloving the arm with her sword. \u00a0Sienna ruthlessly pounded on the severed wrist with her hammer. \u00a0It was as Artpe had said. \u00a0The Demonic god\u2019s abilities were focused within its hand. \u00a0The arm was being directly attacked, yet the two girls didn\u2019t suffer from any mental attacks.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHoo, hoo-ooh\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cMaetel, just hold out a little longer!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cLittle longer? \u00a0I can do this all day\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUnni, get out of there! \u00a0Hoo-ahhhhhhp!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>[Koo-goo-goo-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga!]</span></p><br/><p><span>Everyone realized that Maetel was lying. \u00a0She couldn\u2019t keep this up. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>Despite Regina\u2019s intervention, the underground cave was slowly collapsing. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>In the end, the Demonic god\u2019s hand broke free from Artpe\u2019s Mana strings, and it crumpled the enormous sword. \u00a0Artpe bit his lips.</span></p><br/><p><span>At this point, it really looked like the Demon King had planned on killing them with the summoning.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018I thought it wouldn\u2019t be worse than the Demon King.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>He wanted to punch himself for having such thoughts. \u00a0The mere existence of a creature with such massive energy and abilities was a calamity in itself. \u00a0It was a terror, and it possessed the absolute power of the gods. \u00a0It didn\u2019t need intelligence or consciousness to be a dangerous.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBack off! \u00a0The hand is coming!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cTsk\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cRegina, over there!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDenied. \u00a0It is impossible to use this spell multiple times all at once.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cEh-eet\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The party members were doing their best to resist against the Fragment of the Demonic god. \u00a0At that moment, Artpe suddenly remembered the Demon King\u2019s last words.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018He told me to rise above the gods. \u00a0He really was laughable until the end.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>Even a portion of the Demonic god overwhelmed the hero\u2019s party, yet the Demon King expected Artpe to overcome all of it by himself. \u00a0He knew the Demon King was a psycho, but he had a renewed appreciation of this fact.</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe grumbled as he raised one hand. \u00a0Several hundred thousand Mana Strings appeared from his hand. \u00a0He once again restricted the movement of the hand. \u00a0Despite the Reclamation magic and Roa\u2019s Greed ability, the hand\u2019s power couldn\u2019t be weakened. \u00a0It started to suppress and break apart Artpe\u2019s Mana.</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe furrowed his brows as he sensed the hand\u2019s innate ability. \u00a0How could such an Innate ability exist? \u00a0It was pure destruction. \u00a0It truly was something\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSsssp. \u00a0I have no choice.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe cleared his palate as he desperately gathered the Mana that was being suppressed by the hand. \u00a0Fortunately, there was a portion of the Mana leftover after it suffered under the Demonic god\u2019s Innate ability. \u00a0It really showcased how much control Artpe had over his Mana. \u00a0He had reached the peak In terms of controlling Mana.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cRecord of Destruction\u2026. \u00a0 Please work.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cArtpe\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>When Etna heard the words mumbled by Artpe, she looked at him in disbelief. \u00a0 Artpe didn\u2019t answer her questioning gaze. \u00a0He put all his will and dearest wish into the spell he spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cMaterialization.\u201d</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

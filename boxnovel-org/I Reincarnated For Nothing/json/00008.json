\u00a0How come? \u00a0Huh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThose are some very good questions.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe laughed in a kind manner as he answered her question. \u00a0Of course, as he spoke, he was gathering Mana into his dagger to attack the silly Skeleton Warrior.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI don\u2019t know either!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh-ha. \u00a0I see!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why it was convenient to have a dummy next to you!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Kill!

Humaaaaaaaaan! \u00a0I give up!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo, you can do this!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I can\u2019t do this!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDon\u2019t believe yourself! \u00a0I want you to believe in me, who believes in you!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Warrior kept swinging its sword, but it was mired in the feeling of hopelessness. \u00a0Artpe had to keep attacking it. \u00a0He had to keep it distracted. \u00a0Maetel was watching a human and an Undead converse. \u00a0She decided not to think too deeply about this. \u00a0The important point right now was the fact that Artpe had brilliantly embedded four daggers into its body..</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. \u00a0This is going smoothly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Goo-ahhhhhhhh! \u00a0I give up!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou suffered at the hands of children, who haven\u2019t even reached half your level. \u00a0Are you really going to run away now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Kooooooooooooooo!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If the Skeleton Warrior simply stayed here, Artpe would play around with it until it died. \u00a0Unfortunately, the Skeleton Warrior\u2019s intelligence wasn\u2019t that high. \u00a0Above all else, the Skeleton Warrior was in the grip of the Rage Buff.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Buff was triggered by an emotion. \u00a0The pros of a Buff skill was the fact that it didn\u2019t consume a lot of magical energy, yet it increased one\u2019s level significantly. \u00a0If there was a downside, it was the fact that it was hard to break out of the emotion that had activated the Buff. \u00a0This was why the Skeleton Warrior was unable to give up on the battle. \u00a0\u00a0It kept following the lead of Artpe for no particular reason than that.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTake more of this! \u00a0More! \u00a0I\u2019m sure you can do this longer, right?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Humannnnnnn! \u00a0I\u2019ll kill you!

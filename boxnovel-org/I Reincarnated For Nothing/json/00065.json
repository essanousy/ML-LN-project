text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Maetel had used Record Divide to deliver magical energy to Artpe. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t her own magical energy. \u00a0She had brought Sienna\u2019s magical energy. \u00a0In the process of experiencing the Record Link and Artpe\u2019s Mana Link, she had perfected her unique skill!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Originally, it was a skill that allowed her to share spells and abilities with Artpe. \u00a0However, she had brought along Sienna\u2019s ability too. \u00a0Something incomprehensible had happened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, Artpe didn\u2019t ask how this was possible. \u00a0He used that time to think about how to kill the Kraken using this new factor. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The conclusion was simple. \u00a0He just had to Reinforce the fragments that were still falling towards the Kraken.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If the Hellfire Sentinel was intact, it would have been impossible. \u00a0However, it had broken apart completely, and each fragments were basically akin to a high rank consumable artifact. \u00a0This was why it was possible for him to pull this off. \u00a0He would have to consume a massive amount of Mana, but Artpe would be able to pull it off by squeezing out every ounce of Mana from within his body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Artpe activated his skill, and at the same time, he took out the Demite\u2019s Gemstone. \u00a0It couldn\u2019t be used as it was originally intended, since it wasn\u2019t completely refined. \u00a0Despite this fact, it could be used in the manner he had used against the Slime. \u00a0It could receive and amplify Artpe\u2019s magical energy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cThis isn\u2019t risky. \u00a0Artpe can do this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After transporting Sienna\u2019s magical energy, Maetel clung to Artpe. \u00a0She gave up her remaining magical energy to him. \u00a0The two were clinging to each other, so they were falling faster towards the surface of the water. \u00a0It was a desperate situation, yet she looked at Artpe with absolute conviction.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The hero insisted on \u2018we\u2019. \u00a0It was as if she was scoffing at Artpe, who had thought about doing all of this alone. \u00a0She truly looked like the hero he had seen in his past life. \u00a0It made him laugh. \u00a0The laughter was a mixture of admiration towards her, and the derision he felt towards himself. \u00a0It was a fifty-fifty mix.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Until now, he had recklessly tried to do everything by himself. \u00a0When he found himself unable to succeed, he had labeled himself as a \u2018fake hero\u2019. \u00a0He did as he pleased, and his thoughts were like a self-fulfilling prophecy. \u00a0He had been ready to run away. \u00a0Artpe had been under a misconception. \u00a0Even in his past life, the hero had never tried to accomplish tasks by herself!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">She had always had companions by her side. \u00a0In his past life, Artpe couldn\u2019t understand the reasoning behind it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">One plus one was always equaled two. \u00a0Usually, conflict occurred when you put people together. \u00a0There was a far greater chance of encountering a Dragon than to find people one was able to work synergistically with. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As a Demon, Artpe took no heed of others. \u00a0He considered them to be hindrances, and he considered it fortunate if he wasn\u2019t hurt by them. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t as if he liked being by himself. \u00a0However, the situation, the era and the state of his mind at the time made him fly solo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was why he couldn\u2019t completely discard his old habit even after his reincarnation. \u00a0He was with Maetel and Sienna now. \u00a0However, he had assessed their abilities, and he had put them in separate categories. \u00a0He had acted as if he was being rational, and he had done everything his own way. \u00a0This was why he had only thought about sending away Maetel and Sienna from the front line. \u00a0He had considered their roles to be done.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, that wasn\u2019t true. \u00a0Heroes had the ability to make the impossible possible. \u00a0They made things that shouldn\u2019t exist together to be able to coexist with each other. \u00a0The proof was right in front of him right now. \u00a0Sienna\u2019s magical energy was being absorbed and amplified within the Demite\u2019s Gemstone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Sienna\u2019s magical energy was being transferred through Maetel, and it was manifesting from Artpe\u2019s hands.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

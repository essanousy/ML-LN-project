(1)</p><br/><p>\u201cArtpe!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cArtpe-nim!\u201d</p><br/><p>If one was awake, one wouldn\u2019t be able to ignore the chaos that was sweeping through the entire city. \u00a0It was that chaotic. \u00a0The holy priestess and the hero had been immersed in a war that could only be waged between women. \u00a0However, they saw the images outside, and they heard the voices accompanying the footage. \u00a0They immediately stood up, and they ran out of the room. \u00a0Their eyes turned round when they discovered Artpe outside of the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cArtpe-nim, do you know what is happening right now!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have a rough idea, but I don\u2019t have time to explain it to you\u2026. \u00a0Just follow me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Silpennon had shown him his map today, and there was only one region that hadn\u2019t been explored completely. \u00a0Artpe was successful in narrowing down the location that would be most suitable for what was going on right now. \u00a0Artpe took the two girls, and he abruptly started running.</p><br/><p>\u201cAht! \u00a0Holy priestess-nim-kahk!\u201d</p><br/><p>A priest had caught sight of them, and he started running towards them. \u00a0The priest\u2019s head was sent flying when Artpe swung his Mana String.</p><br/><p>\u201cAct now, ask questions later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cArtpe-nim!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. \u00a0I won\u2019t kill anyone that doesn\u2019t possess Demonic energy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDemonic energy\u2026. \u00a0 As expected, hero-nim\u2026..!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI'll tell you everything later. \u00a0We have to move right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Artpe let out a light laughter as he tossed the corpse into his Dimensional Pouch. \u00a0Vadinet was at a loss for words when she saw this.</p><br/><p>Artpe seemed to know everything that was going on inside the temple. \u00a0However, that fact was secondary to what he was showing her. \u00a0Until now, Vadinet had strictly known him to be a magician, yet he was showing her feats that was unimaginable. \u00a0It ran counter to what he had shown everyone on the surface.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hurry before more priests gather here. \u00a0We have to save our friends.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Aria? \u00a0Who is that girl? \u00a0How come she is taking on the main role of a misfortunate heroine?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe is Silpennon\u2019s ally. \u00a0She also possess an Innate ability, and her magical energy beyond her Record. \u00a0She is the ideal candidate to use as a sacrifice for a spell.\u201d</p><br/><p>Artpe grinded his teeth as he spoke. \u00a0They were very unlucky. \u00a0If Silpennon and Aria weren\u2019t discovered by the pope, he would have be able to leisurely move the pieces on the board to his liking\u2026.\u00a0</p><br/><p>At least, Silpennon was able to activate the Artifact, and he was able to expose the true identity of their opponent with truly exquisite timing. \u00a0Fortunately, their true identity was being spread across the city. \u00a0Artpe was within the Zero Class, yet he could feel the city become red hot. \u00a0He could feel the anger, shock and suspicion of the people. \u00a0He could vividly hear the shouts coming from them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe masquerade is at an end. \u00a0Even if we resolve this as soon as possible, it will take a very long time for this city\u2019s faith to recover\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems Artpe-nim had made preparations for all of this. \u00a0While you laughed and conversed with me, you ordered your underlings to expose the dark underbelly of the temple to the whole world\u2026.. \u00a0I cannot begin to fathom the new Artifact and the type of magic being used right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHue hue. \u00a0Isn\u2019t Artpe too cool?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, he really is\u2026. \u00a0 He is too amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t as if friendship blossomed after their fight. \u00a0The two women were showing off their affections for Artpe, and in the end, they had made a connection.</p><br/><p>Artpe started not liking the idea of being connected to these women. \u00a0</p><br/><p>No. \u00a0Didn\u2019t he have hope yet?</p><br/><p>Silpennon will encounter Vadinet at the site, and she\u2019ll miraculously awaken to her true love towards Silpennon\u2026. \u00a0</p><br/><p>Was he expecting too much?</p><br/><p>\u201cKoohk!? \u00a0Hero-nim\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOk. \u00a0Bye!\u201d</p><br/><p>There were two types of priests that were running around the Zero Class. \u00a0There were the priests that were a bit slow in the head. \u00a0These priests still didn\u2019t know what was going on. \u00a0Then there were the priests, who were jittery. \u00a0They were anxious at the prospect of being found out.</p><br/><p>The former group would never cross paths with Artpe\u2019s party. \u00a0The latter group was immediately killed when encountered. \u00a0Roa growled every time a priest was killed, but he wouldn\u2019t let her drain the Demonc energy from the dead bodies.</p><br/><p>\u201cLater. \u00a0I\u2019m pretty sure a more appetizing prey will show up soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Nyaa-ahhhhhhh.]</p><br/><p>Maetel had a good idea as to who that prey was. \u00a0Maetel steadily went into her battle mode as she confirmed something with Artpe.</p><br/><p>\u201cArtpe, what level is the pope?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s around 340.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c340!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor your information, he is also one of the Four Heavenly King in the Demon king\u2019s army.\u201d</p><br/><p>Maetel and Vadinet felt like they had turned stupid when he dropped this enormous bombshell. \u00a0 He smirked as he continued to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Demon King\u2019s army always enjoys hitting humanity on the back of the head. \u00a0By taking the temple, the hero will despair even if they aren\u2019t able to kill the hero. \u00a0That is the way of the Demon King\u2019s army.\u201d</p><br/><p>Moreover, there were two heroes this time around. \u00a0This was also the reason why they were insistent on killing one of the heroes. \u00a0This plan was the height of inefficiency, so it definitely had the touch of the Chef\u2019s hands!</p><br/><p>Moreover, the one overseeing this whole plan was\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201cHis name is Jeriet, and he possesses an Innate ability of Transformation. \u00a0He is\u2026.. \u00a0 He is the weakest amongst the Four Heavenly Kings.\u201d</p><br/><p>In his past life, Jeriet had been one seat above Artpe in the Demon King\u2019s army. \u00a0It was fair to assume that he was probably the weakest now.</p><br/><p>He was like Artpe. \u00a0His abilities weren\u2019t focused solely on the martial aspects. \u00a0If the hero\u2019s party had to fight a higher level opponent, he was probably the most fair opponent.</p><br/><p>\u201cI sense something was wrong with the pope, but I never expected him to be a Demon\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat bastard eats his chosen prey. \u00a0The consumption of his preys allows him to duplicate all the special characteristics of his preys. \u00a0He is able to transform into their form. \u00a0At some point, he took the place of the real pope.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy god\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>She knew their current situation was urgent, but Vadinet couldn\u2019t help it. \u00a0She asked another question.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do you know all of this, Artpe-nim!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is the nature of my Innate ability. \u00a0You cannot hide anything from my eyes. \u00a0Like right now\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Several Mana Strings extended from his hand, and the strands swiped at empty air.</p><br/><p>In the next moment, a part of the hallway naturally crumbled, and a staircase leading downward was revealed.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy god\u2026.. \u00a0 Your powers really gives me the chills. \u00a0As expected of hero-nim\u2026.!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, Artpe\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Vadinet\u2019s eyes were full of love and admiration. \u00a0On the other hand, Maetel was somewhat used to his abilities, so she unsheathed her sword as she asked him a question.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there a way we can win against a level 340 enemy? \u00a0We were able to win against the Kraken and the Ancient Kraken thanks to extremely favorable circumstances. \u00a0The current situation\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really is the perfect situation for us. \u00a0You don\u2019t know this yet, but there is a reason why Demons don\u2019t directly confront a hero in the human realm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Maetel tilted her head in confusion, but Artpe wasn\u2019t the one to explain the situation. \u00a0The explanation was given by none other than the holy priestess.</p><br/><p>\u201cA Demon\u2019s ability is weakened in the human realm. \u00a0There is also a difference in Mana depending on the realm. \u00a0Demons are weakened up to a certain point here, and they aren\u2019t able to manifest their power given to them by their level.\u201d</p><br/><p>She continued to speak as the party descended the staircase.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m embarrassed to say this, but\u2026... \u00a0It is possible to weaken them further with the power I possess. \u00a0It is the significance of being a holy priestess.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs their first act, this was why the Demon King\u2019s army decided to render the temple powerless. \u00a0It is also why one of the Four Heavenly King transformed into the pope to infiltrate this place. \u00a0He did it despite knowing the danger.\u201d</p><br/><p>In truth, the plan had been very successful in his previous life. \u00a0A Four Heavenly King died in that venture, but he had expertly razed the temple to the ground. \u00a0The holy priestess\u2019 tragic end was just a bonus.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, even if I\u2019m capable of weakening them, I\u2019m merely a holy priestess with no battle capabilities. \u00a0That is why I acted ignorant until Artpe-nim arrived. \u00a0I had no choice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe fact that you became aware of their intentions is amazing in itself. \u00a0Even a normal hero won\u2019t be able to see through that bastard\u2019s transformation ability.\u201d</p><br/><p>Unfortunately for their enemies, Artpe and Maetel weren\u2019t normal heroes. \u00a0It was as if they were heroes that had experienced killing a Demon King before. \u00a0On the other hand, Vadinet was only a holy priestess. \u00a0It was quite the feat that she was able to notice the seditious energy crawling through the inner temple.</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess we are just going to rush him. \u00a0He is level 340, but he is weakened since he is in the human realm. \u00a0If this woman casts an additional weakening spell\u2026.. \u00a0Yes, I think it\u2019ll be possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, the biggest variable that could sway the outcome of this situation is the magic circle.\u201d</p><br/><p>She had used the magic circle in her past life to transmogrify herself into a Demon. \u00a0As expected, the holy priestess made an astute observation.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said the Demon has a transformation ability, and he ate the pope. \u00a0In turn, this gives him everything possessed by the pope, so he probably gained the ability to use the magic circle\u2026. \u00a0 However, it doesn\u2019t seem he was able to activate 100% of its power. \u00a0Anyways, there is a high probability that he\u2019ll use the magic circle to amplify his power.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. \u00a0If he did that, he\u2019ll be tied to the magic circle. \u00a0He isn\u2019t just aiming for Silpennon and Aria. \u00a0He wants to eliminate either Maetel or me. \u00a0Instead of amplifying his power, there is a high chance that he\u2019ll use it for a summoning magic.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSummon magic\u2026. \u00a0I see. \u00a0I didn\u2019t realize there was that possibility\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>In truth, similar words were written inside the exchange diary found within the Zero Class by Silpennon and Aria.</p><br/><p>At the time, it said they wanted to summon a level 250 magical beast. \u00a0However, they had a sacrifice now, so they would probably attempt to bring out a much higher level magical beast. \u00a0It might not be a one-off. \u00a0They might attempt multiple summons. \u00a0</p><br/><p>The price of this magic was Aria\u2026..\u00a0</p><br/><p>Artpe bit his lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe said she wanted an active role, but she keeps acting like a heroine in a knight\u2019s tale.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cArtpe\u2026. \u00a0That girl too\u2026.?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, she isn\u2019t mine. \u00a0She\u2019s with Silpennon.\u201d</p><br/><p>After descending the staircase, they ran through a dark hallway. \u00a0The voice and the image being projected above the city no longer reached them. \u00a0However, one thing was for sure. \u00a0Aria\u2019s situation would not get better. \u00a0In fact, her situation was turning graver by the minute. \u00a0Even if one factored in the fact that the Four Heavenly King Jeriet was weakened, Silpennon hadn\u2019t reached level 220 yet. \u00a0Jeriet wasn\u2019t a foe that could be overcome by Silpennon.</p><br/><p>\u2018If he is like the one I knew, he\u2019ll act big. \u00a0He\u2019ll try to show off. \u00a0He\u2019ll give the hero\u2019s party the time to make preparations. \u00a0He\u2019s supposed to be the prototypical Four Heavenly King of the Demon King\u2019s army\u2026. \u00a0If he finds out about the footage that is being sent out through Silpennon\u2019s magical tool, the situation will get worse. \u00a0Then Silpennon will try to save Aria even if it is unreasonable for him to do so. \u00a0He might get hurt\u2026.. \u00a0Shit!\u2019</p><br/><p>That was why it would have been better if they weren\u2019t found out in the first place!</p><br/><p>If so, the reformed holy priestess would have worked with the two heroes to gratifyingly fuck over the pope and his core allies. \u00a0Artpe would have been able to induce a classic scenario. \u00a0However, he was about to lose two precious talents if things continued along this path! \u00a0On top of that, the temple was going to be destroyed in its entirety!</p><br/><p>\u201cArtpe! \u00a0Over there!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKill them all!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood!\u201d</p><br/><p>The secret hallways reached all corners of the Zero Class. \u00a0The priests, who had thrown away their god to worship the Demonic god, were using the secret hallways to converge on the magic circle!</p><br/><p>Artpe and Maetel were merciless as they cut down anyone in their path. \u00a0Vadinet was very flustered as she watched them. \u00a0Then she finally realized she could do something to help them.</p><br/><p>\u201cO...oh, my god! \u00a0The heroes are fighting against evil as you\u2019ve ordered. Please imbue them with power suitable for this situation! \u00a0Hero Bless!\u201d</p><br/><p>This was something only a holy priestess could use on a hero. \u00a0It was a buff spell. \u00a0This was obvious, but this was the first time Artpe and Maetel had received it.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t a clear amplification of their power, but it felt as if their bodies were light as feather. \u00a0The feeling was temporary, but it felt as if they had leveled up multiple times at once.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is a buff that increases the quality of your soul! \u00a0I thought it might be something that both of you must have when facing an opponent with a higher level\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, yes. \u00a0This is the first time I\u2019ve received a buff. \u00a0It\u2019s something new.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fortunately, this blessing wasn\u2019t headed only towards Artpe. \u00a0It would have been a lie if he said he hadn\u2019t been worried. \u00a0However, even Vadinet was able to discern what was most important right now.</p><br/><p>When Artpe saw this, he carelessly smiled towards Vadient. \u00a0At his gaze, Vadinet felt embarrassment and happiness. \u00a0She lowered her head.</p><br/><p>\u2018Does Artpe-nim know about what I did back then\u2026..? Ah. \u00a0Ah-ooh-ooh. \u00a0Artpe-nim is so advanced in the path of magic that he might have noticed it. \u00a0I see. \u00a0He acted completely innocent during the Blessing\u2026.. \u00a0I can\u2019t believe how truly great he is.\u2019</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t matter what Artpe did. \u00a0In the end, she felt herself liking him more. \u00a0Her feelings surged. \u00a0In that aspect, she was similar to Maetel. \u00a0Artpe, who was unaware of her feelings, just continued to move forward.</p><br/><p>After several more priests(There were only 20 priests residing within the Zero Class. \u00a0They had killed a lot of them.) were killed, they were finally able to reach the scene.</p><br/><p>\u201cSilpennon, are you somehow holding out\u2026.. \u00a0 Huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was ready to overturn everything as he poured his magic into his Magic String. \u00a0He forcefully kicked the door open, and he saw the underground square. \u00a0Artpe was having a hard time believing his eyes.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t want it to happen, but he had been ready for the worst case scenario of Aria being sacrificed. \u00a0He had been prepared to face a level 300 three-headed monster\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.</p><br/><p>\u201cAria!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOoht. \u00a0Ooh-ahhhhhhhh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKoohk. \u00a0Y...you bitch!\u201d</p><br/><p>The center of the magic circle was still letting out an uncontrollable amount of light.</p><br/><p>However, the magic wasn\u2019t completed for the duration. \u00a0The Mana of the magic circle was pouring into the sacrifice, who had been placed in the middle of the magic circle.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7?\u201d</p><br/><p>Artpe rubbed at his eyes as he looked at the scene again. \u00a0He used his Read All ability, but the information he received wasn\u2019t different from what he already knew.</p><br/><p>Aria was using her Innate ability.</p><br/><p>She was assimilating with the magic circle.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

\u00a0Was it strong enough?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was confident that it could eat the female knight and the red haired brat. \u00a0However, the other two brats made it feel uneasy. \u00a0If it was uneasy, it had to eat more. \u00a0The Giant Slime made a firm resolve as it made a request to the Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Open the 9th floor!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMaybe, this is what happens when a Dungeon encounters a hero. \u00a0It could be a special change that occurs to match the current situation of the heroes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe watched the Giant Slime eat the level 100 and above Slimes on the 9th floor. \u00a0He became pretty sober as he mumbled to himself. \u00a0Maetel tilted her head in puzzlement as she asked him a question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDoes that hold true when we face other adventurers?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat I\u2019m discussing right now isn\u2019t that simple of a problem. \u00a0A hero is born when a Demon King appears. \u00a0A hero\u2019s presence could create a Dungeon, a city or even a country. \u00a0A hero causes a fundamental change to one\u2019s surrounding.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had explained this before to Maetel once. \u00a0He wasn\u2019t joking. \u00a0It was real. \u00a0The hero\u2019s existence itself was a miracle, and the hero was the focal point in causing changes to the Records.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one thought about it from that perspective, the biggest variable causing his past life and the current life to change so starkly wasn\u2019t the action of Maetel. \u00a0The change might be driven by the existence of the newly born hero in Artpe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOf course, a hero possesses incredible abilities within one\u2019s body. \u00a0However, they have an uncharted ability to cause change to a situation. \u00a0Maybe, this Dungeon and the growth of the Slime might be aggressively helped by our presence.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Slime eventually went over level 150. \u00a0It was so large that it wasn\u2019t able to move unless it caused changes to its body. \u00a0The amount \u00a0and density of the magical energy within its body wasn\u2019t normal anymore.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These were Slimes that would have probably rested inside the heart of the Dungeon until end of time, yet the Dungeon opened up the walls when the floor was broken by the Giant Slime.

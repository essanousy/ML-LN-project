He hadn\u2019t intended for this, yet their levels had increased explosively. \u00a0They didn\u2019t really intend for this to happen, yet they had experienced a tempest of growth. \u00a0\u00a0They really didn\u2019t need to go searching for a different Dungeon as of now. \u00a0As expected, the power of a hero was amazing!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Somehow, Maetel looked wistful at his words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo we aren\u2019t going to any more Dungeons? \u00a0I thought the Dungeons were really fun. \u00a0I love becoming stronger!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if she wasn\u2019t a hero, he surmised she would have become the strongest in the world no matter what her Class was. \u00a0While he had this distant thought, he soon let out a bitter laugh as he consoled her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere will come a day when you\u2019ll have to basically live inside Dungeons even if you don\u2019t want to. \u00a0That is why you should be patient for now. \u00a0At the very least, we won\u2019t be pushed around at this level.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the demon world, it was hard for beings under level 200 to strut around in the Demon world, but they were in the human world. \u00a0The grand master of this kingdom had barely exceeded level 200, yet the world praised his name. \u00a0No one will be able to restrain them in such a world.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On top of that, they possessed the Record Link, and Maetel\u2019s various skills had grown significantly. \u00a0If the specialness of being a hero was added, he wondered if any being under level 200 would be able to face her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In a world where level was the absolute indicator of one\u2019s strength, the fact that she could jump over this demarcation was an amazing talent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHowever, if we meet anyone above that level, we have to run away. \u00a0The high rank Class over level 200 differ in quality.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWasn\u2019t the Slime we just caught over level 200?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat one is an exception. \u00a0It is like the weakest amongst the four Heavenly Kings. \u00a0He is frequently excluded from being listed amongst the ranks of the strongest beings.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It didn\u2019t matter how far it had evolved. \u00a0In the end, the Slime suffered an ignominious death even after it ate all the Mana in its vicinity to become huge.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the reason why Artpe had been relaxed even as the Slime ate an entire Dungeon. \u00a0It wouldn\u2019t have mattered if it evolved using 10 or 100 floors. \u00a0He would have left it alone. \u00a0He would have considered it a great opportunity to completely refine the Demite\u2019s Gemstone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAs expected, Artpe is amazing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou always come to that conclusion.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-hoo-hoong.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It looked as if Maetel was very happy that she was alone with Artpe again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe was slowly getting used to her endless affection and skinship. \u00a0However, he worried she would get sick of him some day. \u00a0A person\u2019s feeling was one of the most powerful motivators, but emotions were temporary and fickle. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t something that was easy to deal with.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It isn\u2019t as if I want to detain the hero. \u00a0However, if she stops following my directions before we kill the Demon King, it\u2019ll be a problem. \u00a0Maybe, I can use Charm magic\u2026. \u00a0No, that plan is impossible if her resistance to Mana is put into consideration\u2026. \u00a0Tsk. Yes, I have to admit it to myself. \u00a0I wouldn\u2019t like myself if I did that to her.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He tried hard to think like the bad guy, but in the end, he let out a sigh. \u00a0Yes, he really hated messing with another being\u2019s free will. \u00a0From the time he was enslaved by the Demon King, he had suffered under the same treatment. \u00a0He knew how shitty something like that was.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What if he did that to a hero? \u00a0Even if god could forgive him, Artpe wouldn\u2019t be able to forgive himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Moreover, if I am to be a little bit more honest with myself, I\u2026..\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe had been trying very hard not to have these thoughts until now, yet he attempted to confront his inner feelings\u2026. \u00a0His face suddenly turned red, and he stopped that train of thought.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he stopped the thought process, the scene from his past life flashed through his mind. \u00a0It was the sight of the dependable and pure hero\u2019s face, who had faced him in front of the Demon King\u2019s castle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Artpe, what\u2019s wrong? \u00a0Are you in pain?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNope. \u00a0It\u2019s nothing. \u00a0Hey, your face is too close. \u00a0Move it. \u00a0Hey.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI don\u2019t want to! \u00a0I want to hold your hand!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Her timing was uncanny as she pushed her face towards Artpe. \u00a0Artpe was startled, so he tried to push her away. \u00a0However, there was no way Artpe could win in terms of strength.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, Artpe had to do what Maetel wanted. \u00a0She gained ownership of Artpe\u2019s arm. \u00a0She energetically swung their arms as if they were little children going on a picnic.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI really love the fact that we are walking together! \u00a0\u00a0Just the two of us!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou'll be sick of it soon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll never be sick of it. \u00a0Not even in a thousand years!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe scale you think in is like that of a dragon's\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, Artpe had to laugh at Maetel\u2019s innocent reply.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then he spoke to her in a kind voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet's go recruit a new member for the hero\u2019s party.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEeeesh-eeeeng!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As soon as she expressed her pleasure at being alone with him, Artpe immediately declared his intention of adding a new member! \u00a0This savagery was an aspect that was befitting one of Four Heavenly Kings of the Demon King\u2019s army!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In his past life, the Diaz Kingdom had been held together quite easily. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t as if there wasn\u2019t a rebellion caused by the Archduke, but the hero was able to suppress it easily.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Diaz had been peaceful thanks to the hero, and they were able to prosper. \u00a0This was all before the full-out war with the Demon King\u2019s army had started.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018However, it isn\u2019t like that anymore.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe sighed when they arrived at the first town, since they had left the Slime Dungeon. \u00a0The town was quite dreary. \u00a0Maetel, who had expected a bustle of people, was taken aback at the frozen atmosphere of the town.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with this place, Artpe?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is said that when a ruler clears his throat, the citizens would suffer. \u00a0With that in mind, the country just went through a change in ownership \u00a0Of course, the whole country will be in tumult.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In some ways, this was the biggest change that had occurred, because of Artpe. \u00a0If Artpe hadn\u2019t run away with the hero, this rebellion would have never occurred.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If the agitated Maetel, who was next to Artpe, was still inside the castle, the humans that sought to satisfy their own selfish interests and desires wouldn\u2019t have been able to take control.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Still, it was as Silpennon had said. \u00a0This occurred because of the internal politics of the kingdom. \u00a0This wasn\u2019t Maetel\u2019s fault. Of course, Artpe wasn\u2019t at fault either. \u00a0This was why they didn\u2019t need to feel any guilt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Still, this does annoy me a little bit.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe let out a sigh as he looked at Maetel, who looked a bit sad. \u00a0He placed a hand atop her head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t worry ourselves over all of this. \u00a0We just have to do what is within our power, and we have to defeat our final foe, the Demon King.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWill everyone become happy when we defeat the Demon King?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the old tales, the world became peaceful when the hero defeated the Demon King. \u00a0Of course, these were only old tales. Artpe\u2019s view was grounded in reality.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo. \u00a0However, if the Demon world loses its leader, people will rush towards the Demon world to conquer it. \u00a0For a brief time, there would be a need for manpower, and even civilians with no abilities would have a chance to get their hands on a good amount of loot. \u00a0Of course, it also depends on the ability of humans to defend their newly found peace.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Demon world\u2026...? \u00a0What about the Demons in the Demon world?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was astute in the questions she asked. \u00a0For an instant, Artpe thought about his previous life where the Demon King had subjugated their entire Demon race. \u00a0He thought about himself\u2026.. \u00a0\u00a0In the end, he shook his head from side to side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about the Demon race. \u00a0We just have to kill them all.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEveryone said that Demons are bad, but\u2026.. \u00a0There are bad people amongst humans, so wouldn\u2019t there also be kind Demons in the Demon race?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe shut his mouth at the unexpected question. \u00a0Her eyes did not falter. \u00a0She stared at Artpe with sincere eyes. \u00a0This was why he was hesitant to give her a rash answer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026....\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the human world, everyone grew up being educated that \u2018Humans are good and the Demons are bad.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The power of indoctrination was scary. \u00a0Even those that were learned and experienced in the world held absolute hostility towards the Demon race.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018However, she came to hate the humans first.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">To be precise, the humans that tried to kill Artpe, and it was apt to say that her faucet was turned the wrong way. \u00a0Afterwards, Maetel was able to willingly swing her sword against humans.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, Artpe had worried a lot about this fact. \u00a0He worried her nature would move closer to being that of a Berserker.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he just learned that he was the standard she was using to determine what was good and what was bad. \u00a0This was why he decided not to interfere in determining what was right and wrong for her. \u00a0He wouldn\u2019t do so even if the topic was about humans and the Demons.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I wonder if she\u2019ll start to hesitate when killing monsters in the future.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, Artpe let out a bitter laugh as he lightly patted her head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was still only 13 years old. \u00a0This was a question where even Artpe hadn\u2019t been able to come up with an answer. \u00a0Nothing good will come from her worrying over such a question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI already told you the standard of judgement you should use. \u00a0You do what you think is right. \u00a0That is all there is to it. \u00a0Don\u2019t try to take on too big of a problem. \u00a0You should deal with what is immediately in front of you, and it will all work out in the future\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7yes, all right. \u00a0For now, I want to do what you want to do.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe\u2019s answer was a non-answer. \u00a0However, she didn\u2019t want to admit to herself that Artpe was lacking in any aspect. \u00a0This was why she decided to accept what Artpe said as an absolute truth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She decided to pretend that it was enough.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBut\u2026 But what if Artpe\u2026...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, there was one question remaining that she needed answered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat happens if the Demon King is one the the good demons?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, you don\u2019t have to worry about that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Fortunately, this was a question where he could give a definite answer. \u00a0Artpe\u2019s eyes narrowed as he spoke in a firm manner. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf the Demon king is considered to be kind, that would mean no evil would exist in this world.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI understand. \u00a0I\u2019ll trust you, Artpe!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was how the Q&amp;A session between the two heroes ended. \u00a0\u00a0He was sure a day would come when he would come across this question again, but this was enough for now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two had a serious conversation that was unbefitting of young kids as they entered the town. \u00a0Sure enough, the town was being searched by soldiers sent by the palace.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHave you seen him before! \u00a0He\u2019s a youth with red hair! \u00a0Red hair!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe are looking for a black haired brat, and a blonde haired girl. \u00a0Are you perhaps hiding them in your home? \u00a0Huh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Rough looking soldiers were searching each house. \u00a0There was a reason why the town wasn\u2019t lively at all.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The soldiers weren\u2019t just searching for the crown prince. \u00a0They were also trying to find the missing heroes from a year ago. \u00a0When she realized this fact, Maetel was a bit frightened. \u00a0She stuck close to Artpe, but he was completely relaxed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe artifact that obstruct recognition is working perfectly, so we\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStill, I\u2019m worried\u2026...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two of them were using artifacts that obstructed recognition, so it looked as if they possessed brown hair and dark brown eyes. \u00a0These were the most common color amongst the population, and they looked very average. \u00a0If they were still detained even though they weren\u2019t heroes, they could just kill that person on the grounds that he was a pedophile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey, you guys over there! \u00a0Come here and show me your faces!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOf course, there are occasionally bastards like him\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were people, who became violent, when they were placed in a position of power. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t just about one\u2019s voice becoming louder. \u00a0This was especially true when faced with young children, who looked weak.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the solution was simple. \u00a0He just had to put them in their place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHee...heek.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe took off his robe to reveal his changed brown hair, then he floated two fireballs into the air. \u00a0The overbearing soldier, who had been shouting towards them, froze in place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are being too noisy. \u00a0I don\u2019t care who you are looking for. \u00a0Shut up. \u00a0You should go on about quietly. \u00a0All right?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cA m...mage\u2026...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The soldier couldn\u2019t reply properly. \u00a0His gaze was firmly planted on the fireballs, which were moving around freely based on the gesture of Artpe\u2019s hand. \u00a0The nearby soldiers had already retreated.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey. \u00a0Aren\u2019t you going to answer me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Artpe glared as he moved the fireballs, the soldier finally bowed his head in surprise.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI....I\u2019m sorry, mage!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you feel that way then get the hell out of my sight. \u00a0From this moment on, if I see any of you, you won\u2019t need a hearth to feel warm ever again.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. \u00a0Yes, sir!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The one that gave the answer as well as the demoralized soldiers exited the town at once. \u00a0It was as if there was a flash flood. \u00a0Artpe gave a light laugh as he turned to look at Maetel.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou just have to simply show them your power against idiots like them. \u00a0This is the easiest way to resolve the problem for both sides, so you should remember this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOooh. \u00a0Artpe is too cool\u2026..!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were stars in Maetel\u2019s eyes. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Mmm. \u00a0It seemed Artpe\u2019s message hadn\u2019t taken hold at all.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat\u2019s so cool about such a cheap threat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI said Artpe looked cool, because you looked cool. \u00a0I just said what I thought!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. \u00a0Yes. \u00a0I was the foolish one.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe let out a sigh as he turned around. \u00a0Since he chased the annoying flies away, he had to acquire a place to stay for the night.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe only realized afterwards that he had made a mistake in his calculations.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHeek \u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cH...hide!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShould we run away?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cP... please spare me!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed the townspeople had become frightened alongside the soldiers. \u00a0No one wanted to open their doors to the party with the scary magician.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh\u2026...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It took them 30 minutes. \u00a0Artpe was barely able to book a room at the inn. \u00a0As he was served soup, he decided not to use magic in front of the civilians if he could help it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe\u2019ll be on a tight schedule starting tomorrow. \u00a0We won\u2019t be resting until we get to our destination, so you should be prepared for it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span

life had undergone countless trial and error to find her companions. \u00a0She started off with a thief, then she joined forces with a warrior, archer and a priestess\u2026..</span></p><br/><p><span

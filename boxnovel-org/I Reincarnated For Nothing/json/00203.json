\u00a0How did you stop that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI just returned everything to its original form.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe was very calm as he answered her. \u00a0He hugged the magic tome to his body, and it started to melt into Artpe\u2019s body. \u00a0The magic tome joined with his soul, and it once again strengthened his Innate Ability. \u00a0The party was struck dumb as they watched Artpe.</span></p><br/><p><span>Silpenon had passed the Magic Stone to Artpe. \u00a0The Magic Stone merely strengthened Artpe\u2019s Innate Ability for a brief moment, but it acted as a spark plug. \u00a0It had spurred on his awakening. \u00a0His Read All Creation ability had already reached its 2nd stage, but now he was conscious of his ability. \u00a0It allowed him to freely used the 2nd stage of his Read All Creation ability. \u00a0He was able to use the Rewrite ability.</span></p><br/><p><span>First, he combined his Innate ability with the Unique spell called Materialization. \u00a0Then he combined it with the Reclamation magic. \u00a0His ability had become whole. \u00a0In the end, these were abilities that had been cultivated from Artpe in the first place. \u00a0It was the natural consequence of everything combining into one.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis appeared where the previous Demon King had died.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Silpennon had retrieved a small Magic Stone. \u00a0It had contained a massive amount of Demonic energy, but it couldn\u2019t escape the influence of the Reclamation magic. \u00a0It was as if it had been bleached. \u00a0Despite this fact, the Magic Stone contained an ominous power. \u00a0Arpte let out a rotten smile as he looked at it.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAs expected, she left behind her ambition for the future generations. \u00a0It really is an ending befitting a traditional hero\u2019s story.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He used his Read All Creation ability, and he could see a magic circle that could open a tunnel to the Demonic god. \u00a0Artpe had to acknowledge it. \u00a0The previous Demon King had been tenacious.</span></p><br/><p><span>If Artpe\u2019s party hadn\u2019t noticed it, some unsuspecting person might have picked it up. \u00a0It probably would have happened after several hundred or thousand years from now. \u00a0An unsuspecting person would call back the Demonic energy back into this world. \u00a0 Or maybe, the surviving force of the previous Demon King would continue their research. \u00a0In the end, they would find this stone, and they would fulfill the dying wish of the previous Demon King. \u00a0Something dramatic might have happened.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOf course, we've gained enormous power now. \u00a0We can reverse the magic. \u00a0It\u2019ll be possible for us to cross into the other world.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDungeon? \u00a0It\u2019s a Dungeon?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cShit. \u00a0In the end, we are going to go fight the Demonic god? \u00a0Really?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>She had been in high spirits up until now as she fought, and the thought of a new Dungeon made Maetel feel excited. \u00a0On the other hand, the other party members turned pale at his words.</span></p><br/><p><span>They had fought the current Demon King, the Fragment of the Demonic god and the previous Demon King. \u00a0Now he wanted them to go fight the Demonic god!? \u00a0Artpe smirked when he saw the appalled expression on the faces of his party members. \u00a0He gripped the Magic Stone then he let it go. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>When he did this, the Magic Stone just turned into a regular Magic Stone containing overwhelming amount of Mana.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAh\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cW... what did you do?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt will be too annoying.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe\u2019s face scrunched up as he spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWe finally got rid of all the enemies in this world, yet we have to go to a new world to fight a different enemy? Is this a joke? \u00a0We aren\u2019t from some martial race.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBut\u2026. \u00a0 If we don\u2019t get rid of the source of trouble\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cA new source of trouble always arises with time. \u00a0If we try to eliminate each problem that arises, who is going to feed the cows?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe had completely wiped away the Demonic energy, but he couldn\u2019t guarantee that humans in the future generations might research a similar energy as the Demonic energy.</span></p><br/><p><span>This was just a hypothetical question. \u00a0What would happen if Artpe\u2019s party went over to the other world, and they erased the Demonic god from existence? \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>Would all strife within the world come to an end? \u00a0Would humanity find a happy ending? \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>No way. \u00a0For a different reason, a great villain would appear in the future, and there will come a time when this great villain would fight against humanity. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cStrife can arise at any moment in time. \u00a0That is why we should leave this Demonic god and the other world to the future hero.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYour explanation sounds very plausible, but in the end, you just don\u2019t want to fight any more ...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>That was the correct answer. \u00a0If left alone, it wasn\u2019t as if the other side could invade this world. \u00a0There was no need to cross over to the other world. \u00a0It was unnecessary.</span></p><br/><p><span>Still, his power of Revision was able to block the tunnel heading towards the other world. \u00a0If someone capable of breaking open the tunnel appeared, it meant the person would already have enough power to cause trouble even without the help of the Demonic god. \u00a0Artpe was fine if that happened.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI have no idea if this is alright!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAh. \u00a0I don\u2019t know. \u00a0If anyone really wants to go, I can send them there. \u00a0Do you guys want to go?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He had just erased the Record within the Magic Stone, yet Artpe declared in a confident manner. \u00a0He had awakened to his 2nd stage of the Read All Creation ability. \u00a0He had reached a domain that couldn\u2019t be understood by his party members, and his party members were aware of this fact. \u00a0If he said he could send them to the Demonic god, they didn\u2019t doubt his words.</span></p><br/><p><span>This was why everyone turned pale, and they shook their head from side to side. \u00a0The only one that looked a bit regretful was Roa.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNyaa. \u00a0I'll go later if I start craving for it. \u00a0Nyaa-ah-ah.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat is this? \u00a0There is this unbearable feeling of ickiness\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAll hero\u2019s story is like that. \u00a0The story that comes afterwards always leaves a bad taste in one\u2019s mouth. \u00a0If we don\u2019t leave behind a single seed of misfortune and uneasiness, our future generations will have nothing to do. \u00a0It\u2019ll spice up their lives.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Everyone gave up on arguing with Artpe at that point in time.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes. \u00a0This is like you, Artpe.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSo we really were successful in finding peace without sacrificing an ally. \u00a0This will hold true until one of you stab each other in the back\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe only thing left is to settle our balance with Artpe-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>As expected of Artpe\u2019s party members, they were going out of their way to plant the seed of uneasiness within him. \u00a0He flicked the forehead of all his party members, then he received Etna from Regina.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI protected all of them. \u00a0It was tough.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes, yes. \u00a0You worked hard. \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7it seems she\u2019s in a critical state..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Etna was able to uncover Nanarai\u2019s Innate ability before it was too late. \u00a0However, as a price, most of her Spirit energy had been consumed. \u00a0 She was out cold right now.</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe quickly filled up her Mana, but she needed to be conscious to be able to turn the Mana into Spirit energy. \u00a0If she was left alone, there was a possibility that she would never wake up.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat damn sunbae. \u00a0He really is causing me trouble until the end.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>However, Etna was no longer in peril. \u00a0The [Reclamation] simply returned everything back to its original form. \u00a0He had moved beyond that power. \u00a0He could use [Revise] to get anything he wanted. \u00a0In Artpe\u2019s current state, he was able to convert Mana into Spirit energy. \u00a0It was a task that was easier than killing the Demon King Ganet Orzodia.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat power\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Regina finally recognized the power awakened within Artpe. \u00a0Her eyes had turned round. \u00a0Artpe smirked as he brought a finger to his lips in a shhh gesture. \u00a0After the Mana around Etna was turned into Spirit energy, he filled Etna\u2019s body with it.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKuh-hoohk\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Etna coughed as she opened her eyes. \u00a0Her two eyes took in Artpe, who had a playful look on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cArtpe\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 Did we win?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWe won.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIs it over?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is over.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGood\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u00a0Amazing. \u00a0You are the best.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>She had inwardly thought that she would never wake up again. \u00a0However, it seemed Artpe had \u00a0picked up her slack as he magnificently defeated their enemy. \u00a0At Artpe\u2019s words, Etna put on a faint smile as she planted a short kiss on his lips. \u00a0Maetel became apoplectic when she saw this.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cW...wait a moment. \u00a0I\u2019m the one that\u2019s supposed to wrap things up with a kiss!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI already did it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOooooooooh! \u00a0I knew I should have killed you!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Maetel raged, but everyone just smirked as they looked on. \u00a0The fact that she was able to get mad at such a simple thing brought home the fact that there was peacel now.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhere?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAnywhere.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe face was resolute as he answered the question. \u00a0He spoke the dream he wanted as soon as he returned to the past. \u00a0 He truly looked determined.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019ll go to a place where it is possible to set up a dairy farm.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Twenty years passed.</span></p><br/><p><span>The world was greeted with a tremendous upheaval. \u00a0The Demons had been changed back into humans. \u00a0The Demon realm and human realm was combined into one. \u00a0The truth behind the Demon race was revealed. \u00a0The Demons were an existence born through human greed. \u00a0It really brought home the fact that it was good to trust no one but yourself. \u00a0That was how everyone felt when they learned the truth of the matter.</span></p><br/><p><span>There were some portion of the Demon turned humans that had refused to accept reality, so they had caused disturbances in various locations. \u00a0However, the humans had grown stronger in the fight against the Demon race. \u00a0They were swift and ruthless in putting down such series of attacks.</span></p><br/><p><span>Peace had returned. \u00a0If one actually looked closer, one would realize that not much had changed. \u00a0At the very least the Demon King and his underlings were all gone. \u00a0They no longer appeared in this world.</span></p><br/><p><span>The King of Diaz Silpennon had applied himself in earnest to become a statesman. \u00a0Through his first Queen Leseti, he was able to create an order of loyal knights. \u00a0He was able to work with the holy nation of Paladia through his second Queen Aria. \u00a0He was able to establish a state religion. \u00a0 As high as his level was, Silpennon received as much love and support from the populace. \u00a0He had protected his nation, and he had protected his people. \u00a0If one thought about his vocation as a thief, it was a truly ironic development.</span></p><br/><p><span>The empire of Zard was successful in becoming the top power of the continent. \u00a0In truth, Zard had wanted to bring Diaz under his flag too. \u00a0However, Silpennon had been a member of the hero\u2019s party, and he was one of the strongest people on this continent. \u00a0Zard knew this truth, so he didn\u2019t dare mess with Silpennon. \u00a0Of course, one couldn\u2019t predict what would happen after Silpennon\u2019s death. \u00a0At the very least, the two nations would maintain a friendly relationship while Silpennon was alive.</span></p><br/><p><span>The hero\u2019s party was dismissed, and they went immediately into retirement. \u00a0Those that were friendly or hostile towards the hero\u2019s party didn\u2019t search them out. \u00a0Even if the hero\u2019s party could be found, they knew the hero\u2019s party couldn\u2019t be moved to any side. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>This was how Artpe finally achieved his 200 year old dream. \u00a0He was able to live the life of a dairy farmer.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHusband~.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou are giving me goosebumps!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>In the morning, Artpe immediately jumped up from his bed when Maetel whispered in his ear. His reaction speed was almost miraculous. \u00a0Maetel, who had called out to him, giggled. \u00a0She took pleasure in his reaction.</span></p><br/><p><span>How can you still be so embarrassed?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI told you not to call me by that title.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBut husband is husband.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDid I deny that? \u00a0I just don\u2019t like hearing it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>If he went along with her antics by being sweet, he knew that a second round of strenuous activities would follow. \u00a0It would be more intense than last night. \u00a0His experience with her for the past 20 years made him aware as to what would happen, so he purposefully replied in a gruff manner. \u00a0He got up from the bed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat about Sienna?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cShe went along with Vadinet to see Oompa. \u00a0Etna went to the field\u2026. \u00a0I think Mycenae is still asleep.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Oompa was the name of the dairy cow they were raising. \u00a0Of course, they didn\u2019t have just one cow. \u00a0 It started out with Oompa. \u00a0Then it went from Oompa II to Oompa Loompa. \u00a0They were raising a total of 23 dairy cows.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIf Mycenae is asleep, it means there\u2019s no one else that\u2019ll bother me for a while. \u00a0\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I can go back to sleep.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes. \u00a0Let\u2019s sleep together. \u00a0We should start making our third child.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7no. \u00a0I forgot. \u00a0I really have to go to work right now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Usually, feelings change over time. \u00a0He had assumed that her excessive and heavy love towards him would change to a different emotion after twenty years, but it seemed this didn\u2019t apply to Maetel. \u00a0Maetel stated that she was half-joking, but she was half-serious about having another child. \u00a0He flicked her forehead before he exited the house. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>No. \u00a0Before he did that\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAh. \u00a0Call the children. \u00a0It is annoying, but they have to study magic today. \u00a0We\u2019ll start the class as soon as I get done with the morning tasks.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was safe to assume that Artpe\u2019s children would be able to live a peaceful life. \u00a0However, peace had to be protected with power. \u00a0Artpe rotated with his wife to teach the children how to protect themselves.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes, husband~\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOoh-ahhhhh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Goosebump appeared on his skin when he was confronted with her last ambush attack. \u00a0Artpe exited the house as if he was running away. Maetel once again let out a warm laughter as she watched his back.</span></p><br/><p><span>She made a milkshake that she\u2019ll deliver to Artpe later on, then she made food for the children. \u00a0After she place the food on the table, she entered the room where all the children were sleeping. \u00a0She planned on waking them up.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is time to get up, children.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>There were a total of seven children. \u00a0Maetel had born two children. \u00a0One was male, and the other was female. \u00a0Vadinet had born a cute daughter. \u00a0 A pair of energetic male twins were born by Etna. \u00a0Mycenae had given birth to a half-elf son. \u00a0Lastly, Sienna gave birth to a little princess.</span></p><br/><p><span>Of course, they didn\u2019t wake up just because she had called out to them once. \u00a0Maetel put strength in her stomach as she let out a fierce shout. \u00a0It was the former hero\u2019s War Cry. \u00a0Of course, the children would wake up.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cMom! \u00a0You used War Cry again! \u00a0The kids will cry!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The first born was Hirtiga. \u00a0He represented the other children as he protested her method of waking them up. \u00a0Maetel just let out a bright smile.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is time for you guys to eat, children. \u00a0Today your father will teach you magic.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOoh ooh. \u00a0Dad is the hardest teacher. \u00a0I just want to raise Oompa Loompa. \u00a0I want to live my whole life on the farm. \u00a0I\u2019ll be satisfied with that life.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDaddy said we need strength to protect the peace, idiot oppa.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The children forgot the complaints they had when getting up. \u00a0They started talking loudly to each other as they walked past mother Maetel into the living room. \u00a0 Maetel followed behind the children. \u00a0There was a satisfied smile on her smile.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes. \u00a0This is it. \u00a0I\u2019m fine with this. \u00a0\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7there is no need to rewind it again.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The past 20 years had been peaceful, and it had been picture perfect.</span></p><br/><p><span>In that span of time, she hadn\u2019t used the 2nd stage of her Innate ability. \u00a0Not even once.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

\u00a0They wanted to trot out the heroes to face the Demon King. \u00a0It didn\u2019t matter if other humans gave them nice clothes and food. \u00a0When the time came, they would push the two of them out into the streets. \u00a0They would expect the heroes to kill the Demon King. \u00a0Basically, the two of them were akin to domesticated pigs that would be fattened and eaten later.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, let\u2019s talk about the problem we face right now. \u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPork is too expensive to eat!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe quality of the fodder they are trying to feed us stinks! \u00a0It is pathetic!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Did she understand what Artpe was trying to convey?

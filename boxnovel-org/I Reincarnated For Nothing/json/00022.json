She was slowly becoming acclimatized to the fact that there were some things that were more important than one\u2019s life as an adventurer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was also a fact that the two heroes were equally soaked. \u00a0To make things worse, it was closer to winter than fall. \u00a0The chilly winds were lowering their body temperature.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShould I make a fire?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, I\u2019m cold.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel had a shy smile on her face as she nodded her head. \u00a0Artpe looked up at the violet sky. \u00a0It was slowly getting darker. \u00a0A year had passed, so he wondered if it was possible that the soldiers of the kingdom was still searching for them near here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMmm. \u00a0Even if they are still searching for us, It doesn\u2019t matter anymore.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if one discounted their levels, the skills they possessed were formidable. \u00a0They would be able to face down even a level 200 being possessing a high rank Class. \u00a0There was also no way anyone above that level would be looking for them. \u00a0They had better things to do. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHere.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWow!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe extended several strands of Mana String, and he cut down a nearby tree. \u00a0His actions were so natural that Maetel started clapping. \u00a0However, Artpe\u2019s performance was just starting.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He created edges on the five black Mana Strings, and he rotated them to cut the tree into small pieces. \u00a0He only moved a small portion of the wood pile. \u00a0As a finishing touch, Artpe used Hyper Rubbing to cause intense friction amongst the wood. \u00a0It caused it to ignite.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It burst into flame. \u00a0The whole process took only 25 seconds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAs expected, Artpe is amazing!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf I had a fire magic spell, I could do this in two seconds\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He now had a lot of money, so he wondered if he should have bought simple magic spells when he had the chance. \u00a0Artpe thought about visiting the Tower of Mages in the future as he basked in the fire. \u00a0Maetel stuck close to him, and she started rubbing her cheek against his cheek.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was now used to this level of skinship, so Artpe could only let out small sighs. \u00a0On the other hand, Maetel had a secret smile of triumph on her face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHooo. \u00a0This is comfortable and great \u00a0The fact that we aren\u2019t doing anything is pretty good, Artpe.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI don\u2019t want you to get infatuated with that feeling. \u00a0You have to be careful or else you won\u2019t want to do anything else later. \u00a0The moment you think that work is a losing proposition, your life is at an end.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In his life as a demon, he had seen those, who hit the jackpot through creating a book or a related item\u2026. \u00a0There were those, who dreamed about not working their entire lives by living off the royalties. \u00a0However, these people failed to pull it off, because they were lacking in experience and common sense.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEh-ee. \u00a0It is good to do something like this occasionally. \u00a0If we do it every day, it won\u2019t be as good!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c....sometimes you say smart things.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two small heroes rested quietly against each other.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had been a long time since they were able to spend such carefree time. \u00a0They had been continuously tormented by the internal agents of the Dungeon. \u00a0Their current situation was tranquil and peaceful.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t feel the need to speak. \u00a0The sounds of the water flowing in the ravine and the crackling sound of the wood burning drowned out the silence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When a little bit of time had passed, Maetel opened her mouth to ask a question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c.....Artpe, what are we going to do from now on?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI want to become stronger. \u00a0I want to help the unfortunate. \u00a0Moreover, Artpe and I\u2026...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, you should stop there. \u00a0Everything you said you\u2019ll be able to do to your heart\u2019s content.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cReally!?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel\u2019s eyes had an odd shine to it. \u00a0He was sure she had misunderstood something again. \u00a0It was a hassle to set her straight, so he just kept his mouth shut. \u00a0However, at that moment, a loud sound could be heard without any warning.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Crown Prince\u2026. \u00a0\u00a0Kill\u2026.!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Knights\u2026. \u00a0\u00a0Your highness\u2026...]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The sound of weapons hitting each other could be heard, and he felt the surrounding Mana being consumed to activate a magic spell. \u00a0Then there was a stern voice and a desperate voice mixed in with those sounds. \u00a0It was a scenario that might occur at the beginning of a novel about a knight. \u00a0It was such a formulaic pattern!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Artpe assessed the commotion, his face crumpled as he mumbled to himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShit. An incident immediately occurred when you said something unnecessary. \u00a0I thought I would be able to rest for at least two pages more.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you think I have some ability I don\u2019t know about!?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo, I think this is just part of our karma.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, a fight was going on somewhere close by. \u00a0If Artpe and Maetel hadn\u2019t heard it, it wouldn\u2019t be a problem. \u00a0However, once they heard the sound of the fight, Artpe knew they will get involved one way or another.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is how the world works.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wanted to say she was always like that in his previous life. \u00a0However, he pushed down on those words firmly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yes, this was the destiny of a hero. \u00a0\u00a0It was strange, but wherever the hero went, an incident that might or might not occur in a hundred years happened. \u00a0The hero inevitably got sucked into the mess, and the hero becomes the main player of the crisis. \u00a0The hero would solve the problem in a dashing manner, and his or her name value would increase!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anyways, this wasn\u2019t something that happened just once or twice. \u00a0\u00a0Wherever a hero went, the hero was always involved in something. \u00a0There could be an awakening of a legendary ruin, a visitation by an Arch Mage, the awakening of an ancient monster or an assassination attempt of the royal family!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It made one wonder if a hero would die from stress even before he or she got a chance to fight the Demon King. \u00a0The accidental events that occurred around heroes was frequent and annoying!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI wonder if such tumult would happen in the first place if the hero hadn\u2019t existed. \u00a0Wherever the hero goes, the unrest follows the hero. \u00a0This is why we have to kill the god.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was such an incoherent explanation. \u00a0It was like saying an apple farmer had to behead the king, because there was a good harvest. \u00a0However, Maetel nodded her head in a serious manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll kill a god for Artpe!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. \u00a0How commendable.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While Artpe and Maetel was having an idiotic conversation, the sound was getting closer. \u00a0Screams were interspersed with the sounds of steel clashing. \u00a0Maetel\u2019s body flinched as if she was bothered by it. \u00a0Artpe could easily read her inner thoughts, so he let out a bitter laugh as he spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe\u2019ll eventually be swept up into whatever is going on over there, Maetel. If it bothers you, you should go on ahead. \u00a0I\u2019ll just stay here a little bit longer to warm my body.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. \u00a0No.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unexpectedly, Maetel shook her head from side to side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt does bother me and I want to rescue them, but\u2026. \u00a0The person I have to protect is Artpe. \u00a0If I head out carelessly, Artpe might get drawn in. \u00a0If you were hurt, I would feel like killing myself.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat\u2026..?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was such an unexpected answer that Artpe was at a loss for words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel\u2019s love for him was heavy. \u00a0It was so heavy that he wondered if he\u2019ll be crushed to death by it. \u00a0On a side note, he was afraid his presence was having a weird influence on the pure hero.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If it was the hero from his past life, she would have immediately ran towards those in trouble, and she would have saved them. \u00a0It wouldn\u2019t matter if the place held traps or a strong foe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, she now had Artpe. \u00a0She had someone she had to protect. \u00a0This was why she was hesitating as she mulled over the various consequences of her actions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, he couldn\u2019t blame her for it. \u00a0Most people avoided getting involved in another's trouble. \u00a0They protected what was important to them. \u00a0Artpe was merely a former member of the Four Heavenly Kings, so he was a bit happy to find out that Maetel treasured him so much.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Still, he felt as if something was off.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018When I awoke as a human boy, I surmised that I would become the biggest variable that would cause the biggest change between my past life and this current life\u2026. \u00a0Yes, I was right. \u00a0I\u2019m the biggest variable. \u00a0She\u2019s suppose to be the brightest beacon of light, yet this variable was able to bring her down to the level of a regular human\u2026.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He suddenly felt fear, but he didn\u2019t show it. \u00a0He calmly organized the situation inside his head. \u00a0He camly spoke towards the blond-haired girl, who was looking at him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat sounds idiotic. \u00a0We'll become involved anyways. \u00a0That is why you should just do whatever you feel like doing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI want to be by Artpe\u2019s side\u2026\u2026forever.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c....yes. \u00a0All right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It felt as if he had received an excessively heavy confession of love, but he dismissed it as him imagining things. \u00a0Artpe let out a big sigh as he got up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. \u00a0Artpe?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHmmph.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had made the fire, because he wanted to create a suitable atmosphere. \u00a0However, he just need a small amount of Mana to dry their clothes. \u00a0He emitted a small amount of Mana to try his underwear and robe. \u00a0Then he extended his hand to make her body moisture-less.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSince our clothes are dry now, let\u2019s go. \u00a0If I\u2019m going, will you go?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c.....yes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two heroes kept talking in a manner unfitting heroes, yet they were finally able to take on work that heroes would undertake. \u00a0A hero was a violent force that butted into other\u2019s fights. \u00a0The hero attempted to solve problems in a manner to their liking. \u00a0Heroes were the ultimate busybody. \u00a0This was what a hero was!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSince we are about to intrude on someone else\u2019s business, I\u2019ll tell you about the basic stance we\u2019ll take.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe ran through the forest with Maetel as he spoke to her. \u00a0Artpe\u2019s stamina was very poor compared to Maetel. \u00a0However, he had gone past level 140, so he had enough physical prowess to overpower most mercenaries. \u00a0He wasn't just a simple magician. \u00a0He possessed the Hero Class and it had influence on him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe most difficult part is deciding, which side is the aggressor. \u00a0We have no idea about the circumstances behind the fight. \u00a0We have no idea who is good and who is bad. \u00a0This kind of stuff isn\u2019t as clear cut as one would like it to be.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh-mmmm. \u00a0This is too difficult.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, let\u2019s say we decided which person we want to kill.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHeeeek!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Up until now, she had only slaughtered monsters. \u00a0Maetel freaked out at the idea of killing a human. \u00a0As expected, she was immature regarding this type of stuff. \u00a0Artpe let out a bitter laugh as he continued his explanation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat if we find out later that we killed the good guys? \u00a0What if we helped the bad guys? \u00a0There are times when such a thing occurs.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou can\u2019t kill good people!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHowever, there could be misunderstandings. \u00a0The good guys might think we are the bad guys too, and they might fight us.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo way\u2026...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unshed tears glistened in the innocent hero\u2019s eyes. \u00a0She was confronted with an explanation that couldn\u2019t be accepted by the simplistic values she possessed. \u00a0This was why her mind was in a state of confusion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Truthfully, Maetel was incredibly cute right now. \u00a0How could she be so righteous and innocent! Every time he cause a black stain on her pure white heart it was the sweetest\u2026. \u00a0\u00a0Crap. \u00a0A bad habit he picked up during his days as the Four Heavenly King had almost appeared. \u00a0Artpe calmed himself as he continued to speak his words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat is why our standard of judgment can\u2019t be absolute good or evil.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh\u2026..?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo one can determine what is absolutely good or evil. \u00a0This is the province of the gods. \u00a0This isn\u2019t something dem\u2026. \u00a0This isn\u2019t something should be decided by humans. \u00a0If we make such judgments, it would be a form of arrogance and delusion.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuuuuuuh\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were getting closer to the commotion. \u00a0This was why Artpe had to make this simple. \u00a0He had to speak with a firm voice, so she would never forget it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is why you should think of anyone that hates you as being evil.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a way of thinking more befitting a Demon King than a hero.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf someone tries to kill you, harm you, use you or have indecent desires\u2026. \u00a0They are all evil. \u00a0You put yourself on the side of the good, and the others on the side of evil.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHowever, Artpe, you just said we shouldn\u2019t decide what is good or evil\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe aren\u2019t determining absolute good and evil. \u00a0It is a relative form of of good and evil. \u00a0You accept that you won\u2019t always be right, then you do what you want.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was such an absurd, ridiculous and fraudulent way of thinking. \u00a0Even if Maetel was young and naive, she knew Artpe\u2019s words were wrong. \u00a0A single slip would make one fall into the pit of evil. \u00a0It was an absurdly selfish and arrogant way of thinking.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he had lived with such a philosophy as a demon for several hundred years. \u00a0He had been the weakest amongst the Four Heavenly Kings, and he always suffered under irrational violence. \u00a0This was why he had developed such a mindset.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Nevertheless\u2026...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cArtpe....\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel raised her still shaking eyes to look at Artpe. \u00a0She knew they had entered into the site of the fight, yet she still asked the question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow do you judge me, Artpe?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou dummy. \u00a0You don\u2019t even have to ask me that question. \u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe lifted the corner of his mouth. \u00a0He laughed as he made a statement.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are \u2018always\u2019 in the category of absolute good for me, hero-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......all right, Artpe.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel firmly nodded her head. \u00a0Across the thicket, weapons were clashing noisily. \u00a0She answered him as she threw herself towards the site of the battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen I\u2019ll do whatever what I want to do!\u201d</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

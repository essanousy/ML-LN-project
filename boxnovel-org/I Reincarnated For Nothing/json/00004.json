There are grasses you can eat, and of course, there are the ones that can treat wounds. \u00a0There are even a grass that can recover your energy. \u00a0He also taught me about which grasses are dangerous to eat.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI ignored you when you said you ate grass before, but now it sounds as if your words were predictive....\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet\u2019s rest for a little bit until the medicine soaks in. \u00a0Ah. \u00a0Before we do that....\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel found a patch of grass nearby, and she pulled out the wide leaved grasses. \u00a0She wiped it off on her sleeve. \u00a0Then she wrapped the wide leaves around the wound administered with the paste. \u00a0She tied it loosely.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had looked fiendish when fighting the goblins, but in this light, she showed her feminine side. \u00a0If he was a normal boy, he would have fallen for her at this point in time. \u00a0Of course, Artpe was able to sidestep this issue. \u00a0The number one cause of death for the Four Heavenly Kings had been honey traps. \u00a0He was well-informed regarding this issue, so his heart didn't beat faster at all.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOopsy daisy. \u00a0It\u2019s all done.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......thank you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is nothing compared to what Artpe has done for me!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel had a big smile on her face as she sat next to Artpe. \u00a0After the battle with the goblins had ended, they had decided to recover from the fatigue caused by their first battle. \u00a0They rested on top of a big boulder that was nearby.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat I did for you\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe felt guilty at Maetel\u2019s words, so he let out a bitter laugh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Truthfully, he had mixed feelings about all of this. \u00a0Was he really the same person as the version of himself, who had grown up with Maetel? \u00a0Why did Artpe have no memory of the time before he regained his memories?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you tired, Artpe? \u00a0I\u2019ll let you use my lap as a pillow. \u00a0Why don\u2019t you sleep even if it is for a brief time?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...no.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe faced the angelic and kind face of Maetel. \u00a0\u00a0He felt awkward facing her, so he surreptitiously turned his gaze towards the sky. \u00a0The glow of the setting sun was slowly spreading across the sky.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They didn\u2019t have any time to waste.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMy wound is fine. \u00a0Let\u2019s get up now. \u00a0It\u2019ll be extremely cold and dark once the night comes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two heroes were still too young and weak. \u00a0It was risky for them to spend the whole night within the forest. \u00a0\u00a0Be that as it may, they couldn\u2019t just blindly go back to the town.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What would be their best option right now?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe let out a gentle laugh as he revealed the answer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe can go into a Dungeon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...what?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel answered back with a question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">For the first time, since he was reincarnated, Artpe spoke words worthy of a hero.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m saying we should go clear a Dungeon!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dungeons were a scary place where it was teeming with monsters and traps. \u00a0However, at the end of the Dungeons, there was always the prospect of acquiring sweet rewards. \u00a0This was why adventurers were lured into the Dungeons. \u00a0Some called the Dungeons as being a gift from the gods. \u00a0Others called it the temptation from the devil. \u00a0\u00a0There were even some, who called it was a prank pulled off by the Demon King.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI like to refer to Dungeons as being rich mines.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cArtpe is amazing!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was unbelievably hard to find rewards within the Dungeons.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were cases where one was able to avoid all the traps, but when one reached the last room, it was revealed that the treasure was hidden in one of the traps one had already passed. There were times when the last boss was killed, but it was revealed that the last boss was the treasure. \u00a0Then there were cases where the last boss didn\u2019t turn out to be the actual boss. \u00a0The adventurer was awakened, in the course of fight monster, to become the last boss by being inflicted by poisons and curses. \u00a0The world was overflowing with such stories!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At this point, it was clear that a god\u2019s nature could be as twisted as the Demon King.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Or were they the two sides of the same coin?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, Artpe possessed the Read All Creation ability. \u00a0He could pierce through all lies to see the truths. \u00a0Nothing could deceive Artpe\u2019s eyes. \u00a0Artpe\u2019s possessed an ability that would allow him to find all the hidden Dungeons, and it wouldn\u2019t be difficult for him to acquire the hidden treasures within the Dungeons! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Of course, in my previous life, I used this amazing ability for the benefit of the Demon King\u2026.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Just the thought of that point made Artpe grind his teeth. If he had been able to take just a 20 percent cut of what he earned from those countless Dungeons, he would have been able to take care of 30 generations of his descendants!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019ll be different this time around. \u00a0\u00a0All right. \u00a0I\u2019m going to work a little bit harder, so I can enjoy a peaceful life as a dairy farmer.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m not sure what you are talking about, but let\u2019s both work harder!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe knew about a Dungeon near the village where the hero was born. \u00a0To be precise, there was exactly one Dungeon inside the forest near the country village. \u00a0It was fitting, since that village had nothing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From the start, he had thought about visiting this Dungeon, while they were running away. \u00a0This was why they had been heading in this direction from the moment they came out of the village. \u00a0It was going as planned. \u00a0The Dungeon appeared not much later.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...is it here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Maetel saw the entrance to the Dungeon, she had an odd expression on her face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo we have to go into such a strange place? \u00a0Isn\u2019t this a burial ground?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll Dungeon entrances are like this. \u00a0It was as if all the makers of Dungeons made a friendly agreement by losing their collective minds.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Aside from burial grounds, there were several thousand year old trees, natural lakes formed within a cave and a ruined house inside a town. \u00a0These were the popular spots for Dungeons.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These were very obvious and suspicious locations. \u00a0However, these spots weren\u2019t investigated unless the hero or Artpe discovered it. \u00a0He had always wondered why it was like that. \u00a0However, that issue didn\u2019t matter now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI don\u2019t want to go in there.... \u00a0My dad said we shouldn\u2019t disturb the rest of the dead.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYour father did a very good job in educating you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Up until now, Maetel had meekly followed Artpe\u2019s words. \u00a0This was the first time she had pushed back. \u00a0Well, it was true that the hero from his past life never visited this Dungeon either.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After being chosen as a hero, she had been dragged immediately into the palace. \u00a0She might have always had an aversion to burial grounds, but that didn\u2019t matter any more. \u00a0There was only one important fact right now. \u00a0She \u2018must\u2019 go into this Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Artpe spoke with a stern voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf we don\u2019t go in here, we\u2019ll be dragged back into the palace.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI like tasteless food even less! \u00a0I also don\u2019t like the cold. \u00a0Woo, woo\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, are you going to go in?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u00b7...yes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The sun had set all the way, and their surrounding was getting colder. \u00a0They didn\u2019t have the time to dawdle. \u00a0Maetel looked as if she was about to cry, but she followed Arpte. \u00a0She had no choice, but to enter the Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, when he actually entered the Dungeon, Maetel tilted her head in confusion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis isn\u2019t a grave?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel had expected to see a coffin with a dead body within. \u00a0She had expected cold brick walls with hidden bats and long spiderwebs. \u00a0The sight that greeted them was a square room, and the floor was covered with brown soil.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When she turned around, she saw the stairway heading outside. \u00a0Maetel was sure she had descended stone steps, yet unbeknownst to her, it had changed into stairs made out of dirt!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cArtpe, Artpe!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel\u2019s eyes turned round, and she grabbed Artpe\u2019s dirty sleeve. \u00a0\u00a0He had somewhat expected such a reaction from Maetel. \u00a0Artpe smirked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDungeons are all like this. \u00a0So what do you think? \u00a0Are you still cold?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo, I\u2019m not cold at all\u2026. \u00a0Huh? \u00a0Why is that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the hero realized the abnormal condition around her, she became slightly confused! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe gave a short explanation to her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDungeons are a form of pocket dimensions. \u00a0You should think of it as a space disengaged from the outside world.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat is a pocket dimension?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe concept of a pocket dimension was first introduced in the year 728 according to the Continent Calendar. \u00a0A demon named \u2018Nanarai Bodra\u2019 set up an experiment where the density of Mana within a limited space was pushed past the maximum permissible amount\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s over my head!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel raised one hand, and she yelled out in a spirited manner. \u00a0Artpe had already expected such a reaction from her. \u00a0He let out a benevolent smile as he asked her a question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhich part don\u2019t you understand?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere\u2019s too much\u2026 You should explain what the Continent Calendar is first.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. \u00a0Let\u2019s lay that aside for now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe gave up on giving her an explanation. \u00a0He was the one at fault for trying to explain a concept of magic to an idiot.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJust accept that such places exists, and the Dungeons occupies that space.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. \u00a0All right!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If she was going to gloss over everything, she shouldn\u2019t have asked for an explanation!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe\u2019ll sleep here today. \u00a0Since we are at the Dungeon entrance, the monsters won\u2019t come near here. \u00a0Moreover, no one will able to find and enter this Dungeon. \u00a0We can relax and sleep.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. \u00a0All right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had said those words, but he prepared for the unexpected. \u00a0He used his fingers to spread several threads of Mana over the Dungeon\u2019s entrance, stairway and the doorway located on the other side of the room. \u00a0It would allow him to be aware of external threats beforehand, and it would give him some time to prepare for it. \u00a0This was supposed to be an impossible task for a normal level 2 hero, but Artpe was able to pull it off.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel watched Artpe work. \u00a0Her eyes were shining relentlessly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cArtpe is really incredible. \u00a0There isn\u2019t a thing you don\u2019t know. \u00a0You are great at everything except exercise. \u00a0You are kind\u2026. \u00a0Moreover, you are a \u00a0hero!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are a hero too.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI... \u00a0I like being a hero, but in truth, I wouldn\u2019t have minded if I hadn\u2019t become a hero.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe finally remembered the words spoken by Maetel in the morning. \u00a0She most definitely said there was something she wanted to be more than being a hero.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had role played at being a hero everyday. \u00a0He knew she loved being a hero. \u00a0\u00a0So what was she referring to when she said there was something she wanted more than being a hero?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe mused over it when he turned to look at Maetel in alarm.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDid you perhaps want to become the Demon King instead of a hero!?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo way!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou should most definitely not become one of the </span><span style=\"\">Four Heavenly Kings. \u00a0It isn\u2019t worth it.</span><span style=\"\">\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m not talking about that!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel\u2019s face had turned red as she fumed. \u00a0Her anger pretty much wiped away the fear she felt for the Dungeon and the future. \u00a0Artpe smiled for the first time, and he gently patted her head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI already know, you dummy. \u00a0Whatever you want to be, you should keep it safe within your heart. \u00a0When the Demon King is dead, you\u2019ll be free.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFree\u2026.?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A hero only existed, because there was a Demon King in existence. \u00a0When the Demon King disappears, the Hero Class would vanish too. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then the hero would be able to acquire a new Class.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat day will come, so you should safeguard your dream. \u00a0You shouldn\u2019t forget about it. \u00a0I will help you achieve it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDream... Do you really think I\u2019ll be able to fulfil my dream?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOf course.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t know what her dreams was. \u00a0However, the dream was probably something she can realize after the death of the Demon King. \u00a0Artpe nodded his head vigorously, and Maetel\u2019s face visibly brightened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. I\u2019ll try harder from now on! \u00a0I\u2019ll do whatever it takes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. \u00a0Anyways, it is time for us to sleep.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes! Sleep well, Artpe!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou sleep well too.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had succeeded in motivating the hero. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Now she would be an active participant in moving forward!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe let out a pleased smile. \u00a0He was able to turn the tide of Maetel reluctance, and his plan was on track now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His expression was akin to a farmer waiting for his harvest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he knew what Maetel was dreaming about, Artpe wouldn\u2019t have been able to make such a contented expression. \u00a0\u00a0He had always been the lowest ranked of the Four Heavenly Kings, because he had a habit of not catching the important developments.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was how the two heroes slept safely within the Dungeon on their first night out.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

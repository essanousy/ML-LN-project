\u00a0If the shoulder had come out, the arm would have been able to swing a weapon. \u00a0 It would have put Artpe\u2019s party in precarious situation. \u00a0At the very least, several in their party would have died.</span></p><br/><p><span>Of course, it also sounded implausible that the Demon King taken this fact into consideration. \u00a0 The Demon King had consumed too much Demonic energy fighting against Artpe\u2019s party, so that was probably the most that the Demon King could summon.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIf you failed to manifest the last Materialization\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat hand is amazing. \u00a0It won\u2019t disappear?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIn truth, I can\u2019t get rid of it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Above all else, the white hand was the biggest factor that had allowed them to destroy the arm of the Demonic god. \u00a0Surprisingly, the hand remained in existence. \u00a0It had reduced its size, and it was as big as Artpe\u2019s hand now. \u00a0However, it was impossible to unsummon it.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis is a bit embarrassing to say, since I\u2019m talking about myself. \u00a0However, an enormous amount of power was concentrated in one place to create it. \u00a0I consumed a lot of Mana, but I also recreated an Innate ability\u2026...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cLet\u2019s call it God\u2019s Hand. \u00a0God\u2019s Hand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>If Artpe didn\u2019t use his special will to control it, the God\u2019s Hand didn\u2019t react to outside stimulus. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t particularly active. \u00a0It simply let out a faint light as it followed behind Artpe. \u00a0Artpe tried controlling it, and he tried putting it on his hand like a glove. \u00a0It was possible to do that.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHeek. \u00a0Don\u2019t touch me with that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIf my will is absent, its power of Destruction won't activate. \u00a0It is completely different from the hand of the Demonic god.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He smirked. \u00a0As a response, he released the hand as he let it float in a different location. \u00a0The only thing left was to check the items dropped by the Demon King and the Fragment of the Demonic god.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDemon King\u2026 \u00a0That bastard left only one behind.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat is that? \u00a0It looks odd\u2026.. \u00a0 I think it is a bell.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>There were few miraculous items that could exist thanks to the mere presence of the Demon King. \u00a0This was one of them. \u00a0All the Record amassed by the Demon King turned into nothing \u00a0when he died, but there were some things that couldn\u2019t \u00a0be swept away by the world. \u00a0These traces of the Demon King remained behind in the world as Artifacts. \u00a0In this case, the only thing left behind was a small bell. \u00a0It was a bell that could be rung with one hand.</span></p><br/><p><span>[Summons to the Demons]</span></p><br/><p><span>[Everything that possesses Demonic energy becomes weakened at the sound of the bell. \u00a0They will also feel an odd sense of loyalty towards the possessor of the bell.]</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe Artifact\u2019s special characteristic is the same as that bastard\u2019s Innate ability.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have a level restriction. \u00a0Does that mean\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe grinned as he nodded his head.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt means this will probably work on the previous Demon King. I think it\u2019ll also help in the Reclamation magic\u2026....\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He shouldn\u2019t complain, because only one item was left behind. Even the loot left behind in his death had contributed in making the perfect recipe!</span></p><br/><p><span>It wasn\u2019t sure if he would be able to win against the previous Demon King. \u00a0However, he was sure that it would at least be a fair fight. \u00a0It was an Artifact that put an end to all the uncertainty he had felt up until now.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cLet\u2019s ease into this. \u00a0I\u2019ll use Reinforcement four times.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s what you call easing into it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe quickly used four Reinforcement on the [Summons to the Demons]. \u00a0The Reinforcement skill didn\u2019t simply boost the ability of the Artifact. \u00a0It was a skill that utilized Artpe\u2019s abilities and Record to strengthen the item! \u00a0After going through four Reinforcements, the item was reborn by taking on a similar nature to Artpe.</span></p><br/><p><span>[Declaration of Demonic Extermination+4]</span></p><br/><p><span>[As Mana is consumed, a resonance that exterminate Demonic energy forms.]</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis looks like the weapon for the final battle\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNyaa. \u00a0You can\u2019t ring it yet, nyaa-ah-ah. \u00a0You have to ring it after I eat the Demonic god. \u00a0Nyaa-ah-ah-ah.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe bell turned white. \u00a0It also has a similar energy signature to Artpe-nim. \u00a0It is pure white. \u00a0It isn\u2019t dirty at all\u2026 \u00a0 How can something be so clean? \u00a0\u2026.I want to dye myself with that color.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHo-oh. \u00a0You still tell funny jokes, Vadinet.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Maetel and Vadinet glared at each other. \u00a0Artpe ignored them as he took out the loot items left behind by the Fragment of the Demonic god. \u00a0They hadn\u2019t killed the Demonic god, yet there were seven dropped items. \u00a0There was a bastard sword, shield, dagger, staff, hammer, glove and a level 408 Magic Stone. \u00a0As an experiment, he held up the dagger.</span></p><br/><p><span>A very terrifying description appeared in front of his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>[Dagger of Destruction]</span></p><br/><p><span>[The user\u2019s life energy and Demonic energy is used as a price to imbue the dagger with a curse. \u00a0Each stab from the dagger cuts away at the opponent\u2019s soul. \u00a0If the opponent dies to the dagger, the soul has to follow the orders of the dagger\u2019s owner. \u00a0However, if the owner of the dagger dies in battle, the owner\u2019s soul will be imprisoned within the dagger.]</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a cursed item. \u00a0It was an item that no one would pick up if they knew the story behind it. \u00a0One would run away without looking back.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cEvery one of these items are covered with dense Demonic energy. \u00a0They are unusable\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe Demon King\u2019s dropped item turned pure white when I used Reinforcement four times. \u00a0It\u2019ll be ok.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe took out several Magic Stones he had gathered beforehand. \u00a0They were supposed to be used when he reclaimed the Demon realm. \u00a0However, the sacrifice of few Magic Stones would allow them to use these weapons of war. \u00a0It was a very profitable exchange.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI just have to use Reinforcement on all of these items.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWow. \u00a0You are right! \u00a0It is turning white!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe\u2019s plan didn\u2019t go awry. \u00a0The weapons were terrifying tools of destruction. \u00a0They had been more suitable for the Four Heavenly Kings rather than the hero\u2019s party. \u00a0However, it really did turn white after going through four Reinforcements. \u00a0After checking the weapon options, he handed them out.</span></p><br/><p><span>The bastard sword was given to Maetel. \u00a0Elrick received the shield. \u00a0The dagger was given to Silpennon. \u00a0Regina received the staff. \u00a0The hammer went to Sienna, and the glove was given to Mycenae. \u00a0Artpe took the Magic Stone for himself.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cArtpe, what about me? \u00a0Huh? \u00a0Me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou aren\u2019t allowed to get too close to him. \u00a0Excessive skinship is forbidden.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI want to receive a present from you too.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe mulled over the problem for a brief moment. \u00a0He pushed his hand out towards those that hadn\u2019t received any weapon.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGive me one weapon each. \u00a0I\u2019ll Reinforce it four times.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWoo-hoo!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>All the loots were distributed, and everyone was satisfied. \u00a0Artpe let out a sigh as he checked his supply of Magic Stones. \u00a0He had too many. \u00a0He had no idea how many he had used in the Reinforcement.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cLet\u2019s rest for real now. \u00a0I have to sleep. \u00a0Sleep and Artpe\u2019s shoulder is calling out to me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo. \u00a0There is something I have to do before we do that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Maetel was about to put her head on Artpe\u2019s shoulder. \u00a0He put up one hand as if to stop her.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI know everyone wants to rest right now, but\u2026.. \u00a0 I would like you to hear my story.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cStory\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Maetel instinctively grabbed his arm.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to, Artpe.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo. \u00a0I have to do it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBut\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Maetel was looking at him with worried eyes. \u00a0Artpe let out a bitter laughter when he saw this. \u00a0He had suspected this for awhile now. \u00a0It seemed Maetel might have regained memories from her past life. \u00a0At the very least, she had a vague idea as to what had occurred.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI want to talk to you guys. \u00a0You can call it a confession if you like. \u00a0It might sound silly. \u00a0 \u2026.will you listen to me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The party realized that he wasn\u2019t joking. \u00a0The party members looked at each other, and in the end, they nodded their heads. \u00a0Silpennon and Etna had already awakened to their past lives. \u00a0They didn\u2019t interrupt Artpe as they kept their silence. \u00a0They really were good comrades.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAlright. \u00a0So\u2026. \u00a0You \u00a0probably felt that something was off when I conversed with the Demon King.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt isn\u2019t just that. \u00a0Weren\u2019t there many incidents like that? \u00a0I knew all the locations of Dungeons in each nation. \u00a0I moved as if I could predict the future. \u00a0Of course, there were times where events didn\u2019t turn out as I had expected, but at the very least, I knew the starting point of each event. \u00a0You probably all had this thought before.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>No one denied his words. \u00a0They knew there were too many incidents where they hadn\u2019t asked too many question. \u00a0They glossed over everything by saying, \u2018It\u2019s just Artpe.\u2019 \u00a0This had nothing to do with his ability to assess the present. \u00a0Some in the party thought that he might have the ability of foresight.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI have no choice, but to know it all. \u00a0It\u2019s because\u2026. \u00a0 I\u2019ve experienced it all once before.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cArtpe\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Maetel extended her hand as if she was trying to stop him. \u00a0He gently pushed her hand away as he made a declaration.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIn the past, I was a Demon in a world that is no longer accessible to us now. \u00a0I earned the title of the Four Heavenly King, and I followed the orders of the Demon King. \u00a0I died facing the hero\u2019s party led by Maetel. \u00a0At the end, I awakened to my Innate ability\u2026.. \u00a0 The world\u2026. \u00a0I rewound the world.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUh\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 That\u2019s quite the joke.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Elrick sounded as if he was punched in the solar plexus. \u00a0However, no one laughed. \u00a0Everyone present could tell that Artpe was being sincere.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI have no idea where to start. \u00a0Your story doesn\u2019t add up, Artpe-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Vadinet replied to his words. \u00a0Artpe let out a bitter laughter when he heard the confusion within her voice. \u00a0He continued to speak.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI didn\u2019t plan on ending my story there. \u00a0Alright. \u00a0Let\u2019s slow things down. \u00a0Let me see\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 I was born in the Demon realm, and I had to follow the order of the Demon King when I lost a fight against him. \u00a0I guess that\u2019s a good starting point.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Everyone was shocked by his words. \u00a0Artpe mumbled to himself in affirmation. \u00a0He nodded his head as he started his explanation.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was the story of a man\u2019s life.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

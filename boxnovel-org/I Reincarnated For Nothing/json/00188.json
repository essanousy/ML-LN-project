font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">The Demon King was using this Dungeon like the Demon King\u2019s castle. \u00a0He had used the Demonic beasts that had been placed within this Dungeon to his advantage. \u00a0The Demonic beasts were emitting Demonic energy, and he had used it to slowly dominate the Dungeon. \u00a0As the Demonic energy manifested more and more, it was making it harder for Artpe to use his Innate ability. \u00a0Even if he tried to cut through the Demonic energy using his Mana Strings, it wouldn\u2019t be an easy task. \u00a0In such an eventuality, he would have to fight directly with the Demon King's Demonic energy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

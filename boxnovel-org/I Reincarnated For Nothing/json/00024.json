Enemy (3)</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In his past life, the hero had been born within the Diaz Kingdom. \u00a0When the hero turned 12 years old, she was dragged straight into the palace. \u00a0This was the biggest mistake that had occurred in the past hero\u2019s life.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The palace followed a Hero Support Manual that was created several hundred years ago. \u00a0While she was reared with the utmost care, the hero\u2019s first party member was added during this time. \u00a0He was none other than this country\u2019s crown prince Silpennon Le Diaz. \u00a0He was a thief.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Of course, it isn\u2019t my business as to why Silpennon had turned down his seat as the crown prince to join the hero\u2019s party\u2026.. \u00a0No, I get it now.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was true that Silpennon was directing his words towards Artpe, but his eyes remained planted on Maetel. \u00a0His cheeks were red. \u00a0It seemed he had fallen for her on first sight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was understandable. \u00a0In her past life, Maetel could have easily ruined couple kingdoms with her beauty. \u00a0She was only thirteen years old right now, but her budding beauty could be seen even now. \u00a0This was why it wasn\u2019t far-fetched to think that the crown prince had fallen for her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Still, Silpennon had witnessed Maetel shed blood with his two eyes. \u00a0It was a bit baffling that he was able to show such pure ardor towards her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI don't want your answer. \u00a0I want to hear it from the girl!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Silpennon browbeat Artpe as he turned his intense gaze towards Maetel. \u00a0Artpe shrugged his shoulders, and he lightly tapped Maetel\u2019s shoulder.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c....if you put it that way, I have no choice. \u00a0You do whatever you want, Maetel.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel\u2019s tears hadn\u2019t stopped yet, but she was released from Artpe\u2019s embrace. \u00a0She faced the crown prince. \u00a0The crown prince looked on with pity when he saw her puffy eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou poor thing\u2026.. \u00a0You are a child with a very tender heart. \u00a0However, you don\u2019t have to be worried. \u00a0The people you killed right now are rebels. \u00a0They are traitors to this country, so you don\u2019t have to be wounded by their deaths\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI hate the palace! \u00a0I\u2019m not going!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Silpennon\u2019s attempt at consoling her failed miserably. \u00a0Maetel cut him off as she rejected him. \u00a0She returned to the arms of Artpe. \u00a0She was as resolute as Artpe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat the\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Silpennon was turned down in no uncertain term, so he froze in place. \u00a0One of the knights protecting Silpennon inadvertently started breaking out in laughter. \u00a0The other knights reigned him in.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Silpennon came to his senses under the impetus of the laughter. \u00a0He had never been turned down so firmly in his life. \u00a0His pride took a big hit, and he started talking incoherently.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW...why not\u2026. \u00a0I promise to give you a lot of things! \u00a0If you help me, I\u2026 \u00a0Y...yes. \u00a0What is your name? \u00a0Which family are you from? \u00a0If you have to travel around with such a terrible servant, it seems to indicates that you are unfortunately not from a suitable family. \u00a0However, when we return to the palace, I\u2019ll use all the power at my disposal to elevate you to a suitable position\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c....did you just insult Artpe right now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She didn\u2019t like something Silpennon had said. \u00a0Maetel remained in Artpe\u2019s embrace, but she extracted her face to glare at Silpennon. \u00a0Silpennon realized he had stepped on a mine, so his face turned pale.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. \u00a0I...I didn\u2019t mean it like that\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI just told you! \u00a0Artpe isn\u2019t terrible, and he isn\u2019t my servant!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cH...he isn\u2019t your servant!?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are really terrible!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It really was a sight that couldn\u2019t be seen without shedding some tears. \u00a0It seemed Artpe wasn\u2019t the only one having such thoughts. \u00a0The female knight, who had initiated a conversation with Artpe, carefully spoke to Silpennon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYour highness. \u00a0Unfortunately, we might have to give up on the idea of them helping us. \u00a0They have already saved your highness\u2019 life once. \u00a0You should be thankful, yet you are trying to detain them against their will. \u00a0This isn\u2019t unbefitting of your station, your highness. \u00a0You possess the great bloodline of Diaz.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKoo-oohk\u2026. \u00a0\u00a0So I have no choice, but to let the girl go!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYour highness\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were playing their parts well. \u00a0They continued to act as if they were still in charge of a kingdom. \u00a0If so, they could do as they wished by themselves.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to do it. \u00a0Are we done here? \u00a0We\u2019re going.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHmmph!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe let out a sigh as he turned away from them. \u00a0As if she was worried about being left behind, she matched his footsteps. \u00a0At that moment, she was very cute.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease stop\u2026...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Silpennon called after them again. \u00a0His voice drooped like a wet rag. \u00a0Artpe didn\u2019t hide his annoyance as he turned around. \u00a0However, his eyes opened slightly wider when he saw what was in Silpennon\u2019s hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease take this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat the\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was Artpe\u2019s turn to be surprised like an idiot.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Silpennon had held up a large jewel that was emitting a purple light from all its surface. \u00a0Anyone, who knew the identity of the precious gemstone, would have reacted in a similar fashion. \u00a0Artpe\u2019s Read All Creation ability didn\u2019t let him down. \u00a0It immediately displayed the item\u2019s info.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Demite\u2019s Gemstone]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Magician]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[It is part of the Limite group, which is considered to be the one of the highest ranked ingredients for magic items. \u00a0It is incredibly high in purity, and as time passed, it gained a Class of its own. \u00a0It is a legendary gem that only appears a handful of times in either the human world or the demon world.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It hadn\u2019t been refined yet, so the gemstone\u2019s enormous power is still hidden. \u00a0However, once it is refined, it will increase one\u2019s Mana by a vast amount, and it would also develop random additional abilities. \u00a0It will also develop a will of its own, so it will have the ability to help the owner finish one\u2019s spell. \u00a0However, it is so hard that it is almost impossible to refine it. \u00a0This is the only flaw to the item.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This is probably worth more than his entire kingdom!?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had run across an unexpected item at a place where he had never expected to find it. \u00a0This was why Artpe almost became lost in himself. \u00a0Silpennon spoke calmly in front of Artpe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSince I\u2019ve incurred a debt to you, it is up to me to express my thanks. \u00a0I am being chased, but I cannot neglect my duty. \u00a0Take this, youth. \u00a0I don\u2019t know what it is, but it has been kept in our kingdom\u2019s treasury for a very long time. \u00a0I\u2019m sure it is a precious gemstone. \u00a0You should sell this, so your master\u2026 \u00a0No. \u00a0I want you to use it to help the girl acquire equipment that would be of help to her.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you really know what this is\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No, if he knew, he wouldn\u2019t have given it to Artpe no matter how great of a help they were to him. \u00a0Artpe cleanly swallowed the shout of joy that was about to exit his mouth. \u00a0He took the purple colored gemstone. \u00a0In such a situation, it was one\u2019s duty to be quiet, and just take the item!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHmm. \u00a0As expected of the crown prince, you\u2019ve received a fantastic upbringing. \u00a0Thank you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs that perhaps a compliment, Artpe!?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The other knights were taken aback when they saw Silpennon hand over the Demite Gemstone. \u00a0\u00a0It seemed all the other knights weren\u2019t like the female knight, who convinced Silpennon to do the right thing. \u00a0It seemed they didn\u2019t put much importance in duty and honor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYour highness, we took that before we ran away from the palace. \u00a0I don\u2019t think you should give away such a precious treasure\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is too excessive. \u00a0I can tell at a glance that they aren\u2019t highborn. \u00a0We can\u2019t give our treasure just because they aided us with the sword once\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHis highness has made his decision, so you should all shut up.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everyone shut their mouth when the female knight gave a fiery order. \u00a0She was level 118. \u00a0Since she had the highest level amongst the knights, he had wondered if she was the leader. \u00a0He had guessed right.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Well, even if she was the leader, they were\u2026. \u00a0Artpe shrugged his shoulders, and he put away the Demite\u2019s Gemstone into the Dimensional Pouch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The knights kept looking back at Artpe as if Silpennon\u2019s actions had left much to be desired. \u00a0The female knight spoke in praise about the crown prince\u2019s upbringing. \u00a0Silpennon tried to act cool on the outside, but the crown prince couldn\u2019t let go of the lingering attachment he had towards Maetel.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMmm\u2026...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe hesitated as he looked at them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t like Silpennon, but this sentiment came from the fact that Silpennon had delivered the killing blow in his past life. \u00a0However, the one in front of him showed some promise.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No, if he thought about it, Silpennon had carried out the dirty deed instead of the hero. \u00a0He wasn\u2019t really that bad of a guy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Every time he saw Silpennon he remembered the calm face of the bastard, who stuck a dagger into his heart in his past life. \u00a0It annoyed him, but when he saw the Demite\u2019s Gemstone in his hand, any trauma he would have felt evaporated in moments.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018All right. \u00a0It feel like a waste to just send them off like this.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why he decided to give Silpennon a bonus.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCould you wait a little bit?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? \u00a0Are you perhaps going to help us.....\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you have any paper?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPaper?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The female knight tilted her head in confusion. \u00a0She took out a piece of parchment from within her clothes. \u00a0She handed it over to Artpe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He opened up the parchment, and he emitted a very small amount of Mana at the tip of his finger. \u00a0Small smoke started to rise up as he wrote his letter. \u00a0It was a trick that can be performed only by those adept at controlling Mana. \u00a0Everyone except Maetel flinched when they saw this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAs expected, this youth isn\u2019t normal either, your highness...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf he is her assistant\u2026. \u00a0At the very least, he should have that much skill if he wants to travel with her. \u00a0He\u2019s a magician.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, I'm done writing. \u00a0Also\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe took out an envelope from his Dimensional Pouch. \u00a0It contained a strange green powder. \u00a0He folded the note, and he handed it to the female knight with the envelope containing the green powder. \u00a0He gave her a light wink.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is only for your eyes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW...what....\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The female knight\u2019s face turned red. \u00a0Silpennon and the knights focused their gazes on her. \u00a0The female knight was flustered, but she quickly hid the items.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cA...are you trying to make fun of an adult!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI was sincere. \u00a0It is only for your eyes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKoohk\u2026...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe was well aware of the fact that his appearance was quite pleasing. If not, a big fish like the leader of the thieves\u2019 army Etna Carlyfate Mirecard wouldn\u2019t have clung to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, love didn\u2019t develop just based on a person\u2019s appearance. \u00a0However, one\u2019s appearance was the first impression one could give, and it was undeniable that it had an immense effect on various parts of the love that develops.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Silpennon was stunned as he looked up at her face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLeseti... \u00a0Really?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. \u00a0No way, your highness! \u00a0He\u2019s just a young lad!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHowever, your face turned red.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt isn\u2019t like that! \u00a0Anyways, I have to check if the note and the powder is safe. \u00a0I\u2019ll keep it in my possession until then!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe\u2019ll be leaving now. \u00a0I hope you live long enough for us to meet again.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe chortled as he turned away. \u00a0He had done all he could for them, so it was up to them now. \u00a0The night was getting deep, so they should return to their own campfire to get ready for camping outside...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cArtpe\u2026...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel\u2019s eyes were murky like the eyes of a dead fish. \u00a0She asked a question with a voice that was colder than winds blowing within the icy depths of hell.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDoes Artpe perhaps like old women\u2026.?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo. \u00a0Nope. \u00a0I promise you that isn\u2019t the case.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had also fallen for the ruse!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe let out a sigh as he flicked her forehead. \u00a0He dragged her towards the campfire.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other side, the crown prince\u2019s party stood in place for a moment. \u00a0Everyone was looking towards one person. \u00a0When the female knight became the focus of their attention, Leseti was flustered. \u00a0She kept waving her arms.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI...it isn\u2019t like that! \u00a0It isn\u2019t, your highness! \u00a0Anyways, we should ready our camp. \u00a0Since we don\u2019t know how long our pursuers will follow us, we can\u2019t rest long\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, we should rest, and you should read the letter.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is probably nothing!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Leseti erased the traces of battle, and she led the crown prince\u2019s party towards a suitable campsite. \u00a0She ordered the knights to make a shelter, so Silpennon could rest first. \u00a0When no one was looking, she secretly took out Artpe\u2019s letter.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat impertinent brat\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed he had good eyes to be able to recognize a beauty like her. \u00a0Leseti let out a self-satisfied smile as she lit a candle. \u00a0His penmanship was so elegant that it was hard to believe a young man had written it. \u00a0However, the letter was stuck to her eyes starting from the first word.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[All the other knights are traitors. \u00a0It is up to you to protect the crown prince before he gets killed or kidnapped by them. \u00a0They were probably waiting the right time to steal the jewel from the crown prince, but he gave it to me. \u00a0They won\u2019t hesitate anymore. \u00a0Ah. \u00a0I've enclosed a poison within the folded envelope. \u00a0You should use it. \u00a0This makes us even.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2026..the content of the letter had gone in a completely different direction than what Leseti had expected. \u00a0The letter still made her heart pound.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">The Demon King was sitting in a space filled with Demonic energy. \u00a0It had been prepared by him. \u00a0However, the Reclamation power of the magic tome was eating away at the Demonic energy. \u00a0This created a phenomena where the hero\u2019s party was standing within a pocket of Mana, and the Demon King was sitting within a pocket of Demonic energy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">At that moment, Artpe found the current situation to be hilarious. \u00a0He hadn\u2019t planned for this, and he couldn\u2019t have planned for this either. \u00a0However, the magic tome was the biggest variable that could influence the outcome of this fight. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">He kept throwing barbs as he talked to the Demon King, but he inwardly felt nervous. \u00a0The current Demon King was pushed aside by the previous Demon King, yet that brought no solace to Artpe. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t as if the current Demon King had his power stolen, because he had lost in a fight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">He still looked imposing, and a thick cloud of Demonic energy was surrounding him. \u00a0It was hard to see his true form. \u00a0Still, Artpe could tell that the Demon King\u2019s appearance hadn\u2019t changed from his past life, so he instinctively swallowed hard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">He couldn\u2019t help it. \u00a0The Demon King had refused to let go of Artpe\u2019s body and soul in his past life. \u00a0Even if he had been able to escape the grasp of the Demon King, it didn\u2019t mean he had left behind all his wounds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

\u00a0The main character\u2019s party used the perfect plan as they were assigned the perfect roles. \u00a0However, it hadn\u2019t been enough. \u00a0The final boss fell to something they found through complete coincidence. \u00a0It ends in the good guys winning, but somehow there was a lingering feeling of crappiness leftover at the end.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">This was happening in real life now, so nothing could be done about it. \u00a0If one really got down to it, was there something in this world that could truly be explained? \u00a0There were those that quibbled over the probability, and the unlikeliness of an event. \u00a0They wondered if an event was too coincidental. \u00a0However, those that thought like that were brats that hadn\u2019t lived a really complicated life that had twists and turns. \u00a0That was what Artpe thought.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">[Let\u2019s fight. \u00a0We don\u2019t need to say much to each other.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">[Koo-hoo\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 I am truly pleased with the light in your eyes. \u00a0Your eyes! \u00a0You lack nothing. \u00a0You truly are the partner I seek for this dance\u2026. \u00a0It\u2019s that look in your eyes!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">The Demon King stood up from his seat. \u00a0The Demonic energy, which was draped around his body, suddenly spread out in all direction. \u00a0It rushed towards Artpe\u2019s party. \u00a0Artpe held the magic tome open as he chanted a spell. \u00a0He also started giving orders to his party members.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cVadinet! \u00a0Aria!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cWe\u2019re ready!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">The Demon King was an excellent magician, and at the same time, he was toxic. \u00a0Petra had used Demonic energy to bring about extreme cold. \u00a0The Demon King\u2019s Demonic energy was poisonous, and he could move it at will! \u00a0If one was below level 300, just being near the Demon King was life threatening. \u00a0A single puff of the poison could kill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">In his past life, he didn\u2019t think the holy priestess could block the Demon King\u2019s poisonous Demonic energy. \u00a0However, there were two holy priestesses in his party now. \u00a0On top of that\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cHooo-ahhhhhhp!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">[What\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Sienna was an Evil Reflector. \u00a0She was the first confirmation that Demonic energy could be changed back into Mana!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">[What the hell is she?

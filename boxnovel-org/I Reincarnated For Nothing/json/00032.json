Artpe appraised each one of them, and he explained to Maetel on the use of these books.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is one of the psychotic things that monsters, beings from other races and humans fight each other for. \u00a0It is something they do in an attempt to live a little bit longer. This is the most legal and safe form of doping. \u00a0It is one of the very few cheat keys allowed in this world. \u00a0There is only one thing we have to give up in return.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe grinned as gold coins poured out of the pouch held out by Mycenae.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMoney.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf one\u2019s ability is lacking, this strategy won\u2019t work. \u00a0A sloppily-learned skill would only lead to tears later\u2026 \u00a0Well, I\u2019m pretty sure you guys will be fine.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Mycenae hadn\u2019t seen them fight, but she had a decent idea on how talented they were. \u00a0They had the luck of finding great rewards in any Dungeon they went to. \u00a0Even if one put aside their luck, they were unperturbed after doing a full clear of the Dungeon. \u00a0Just this fact was very telling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStill, haven\u2019t \u00a0you learned most of the basic Skills? \u00a0This means your Stats will go up slightly. \u00a0You won\u2019t benefit much from them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis allows one to buy one\u2019s life with money\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. \u00a0Yes. \u00a0The fact that you treasure your life is a very admirable trait.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skill Books were expensive. \u00a0The most basic and useless ones were worth several dozen silvers. \u00a0A basic Skill Book was around 1 gold, so one could only imagine how expensive a Skill Book would be if it was useful in battle. \u00a0Maetel counted the Skill Books as they were handed over to Artpe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOnly 14\u2026.. \u00a0\u00a0Moreover, I\u2019ve already learned 8 of them! \u00a0So how much are these, Artpe?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s 619 gold. Of course, there are some that are only worth couple golds, but there are also ones that are worth several dozen golds. Normally a Skill Book jumps several dozen times in value if it becomes known that it is a bit useful.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cA book costs several dozen gold!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDidn\u2019t you just hear that Mana Control was worth 350 gold?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel really didn\u2019t like the fact that she would have to learn a Skill Book when she already knew the Skill. \u00a0She would be doing such an act in an attempt to marginally grow her Stats. However, Artpe had provided all of this with her in thought, so she couldn\u2019t just spurn the gesture. \u00a0She had no choice, but to learn it all.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-ooooh\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAs expected, you aren\u2019t an ordinary talent. \u00a0You were able to learn and get used to the Skills in an instant\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFor the love of god, you are using those expensive Skill Books in one sitting!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat\u2019s the part that surprises you, Leseti?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was an upside in learning all the Skills at once. \u00a0Each of Maetel\u2019s stamina, agility and strength rose by 10. \u00a0Normally, one\u2019s Stat rose by three in total when a warrior leveled up. \u00a0This meant she had gained Stats equivalent to increasing 10 levels.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, a level up didn\u2019t only give Stats, so it was impossible to do a one on one comparison. \u00a0Still, if one was in a situation where one\u2019s death was assured, a difference in 30 Stat points might be enough to allow one to survive the situation. Moreover, if it was Maetel, she would be much more efficient in using the increase in Stats.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo this is how adventurers arm themselves.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI told you it isn\u2019t like that. \u00a0There aren\u2019t that many adventurers, who are blessed with such an environment!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKoohk. \u00a0If I had that much support, I would be stronger\u2026....\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLeseti, it must have been hard on you\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anyways, the purchase of the Skill Books ended without any hitch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The problem was the Spell Books.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere are only 9 Spell Books!?

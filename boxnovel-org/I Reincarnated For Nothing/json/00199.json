In an instant, a level 400 plus high ranked Demon was killed. \u00a0 Of course, the reaction to such an event wouldn\u2019t be minor. \u00a0The Demons, who were under the command of the dead Demon, came to a halt in fright. \u00a0In the end, they were turned into humans by the power of the magic circle.</span></p><br/><p><span>[My power is decreasing.]</span></p><br/><p><span>[It isn\u2019t just our power. \u00a0The aggression that we use to violently attack our enemies can\u2019t be felt. That bastard is trying to shackle us by turning us into humans!]</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cShackle? \u00a0You guys have been wearing a mask up until now. \u00a0Why can\u2019t you see that I\u2019m just taking that mask off?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>When a firm idea took root within him, Artpe no longer hesitated over his actions. \u00a0He didn\u2019t agonize over what he had to do. \u00a0 The Reclamation magic existed to turn everything back into its original form. \u00a0This wasn\u2019t Artpe\u2019s will. \u00a0It was the will of the world, so there was no way this spell would be defeated!</span></p><br/><p><span>[Can it be\u2026..]</span></p><br/><p><span>The low voice of an old man could be heard.</span></p><br/><p><span>[I never expected someone to complete that spell\u2026..]</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHe has overwhelming Demonic energy. \u00a0Regina! \u00a0Etna!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWe are ready.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis Demonic energy\u2026..?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He let the staff use the Reclamation magic. \u00a0He had done this before when he fought against the arm of the Demonic god. \u00a0This allowed Artpe to participate in the battle. \u00a0Of course, the Reclamation magic expanded at a slower rate as a result! \u00a0 This was why he wanted his party to take care of the fighting, but\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWait a moment.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>As he induced the staff and the magic tome to resonate, he was able to gain momentary freedom. \u00a0He put his Mana into the hand of destruction, and in a flash, it grew in size. \u00a0It regained its original size. \u00a0When Artpe relayed his will to it, it spread its fingers, and it created an enormous barrier. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>Afterwards, the Baptism of the Demonic Spear impacted on the middle of the barrier!</span></p><br/><p><span>The hand did well in blocking it, and it destroyed the spear. \u00a0In the process, Artpe was able to assess his opponent. \u00a0He scrunched up his face.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI knew it didn\u2019t make sense. \u00a0I should have known it would turn out like this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>[What is that hand? \u00a0A life form such as this exists in this world? \u00a0No. \u00a0I asked the wrong question. \u00a0It is type of golem made through magic! \u00a0Interesting. \u00a0 A mere golem was able to block my attack. \u00a0How is that possible? \u00a0However, it won\u2019t be able withstand my next attack. \u00a0I already figured out the golem\u2019s special characteristic!]</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cArtpe, he\u2019s annoying.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDon't worry. \u00a0I feel the same way.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The second attack came flying in. \u00a0First, the enemy manifested a magical net to restrict the movement of the hand of destruction. \u00a0Then he followed up with a barrage of powerful magic bombs. \u00a0It was supposed to destroy the hand, but of course, the hand of destruction completely extinguished the attack.</span></p><br/><p><span>[What\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7!?]</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis is odd. \u00a0It is the first time I\u2019ve heard this voice, but his manner of speech is quite familiar\u2026...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is also annoying.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe\u2019s party members felt a weird sense of de ja vu as they raised their weapons. \u00a0Artpe knew they were in a desperate situation, yet the couldn\u2019t suppress his laughter. \u00a0His Read All Creation ability had already picked up on the presence of his enemy.</span></p><br/><p><span>Maybe, the Demon was confident no one could pierce through his stealth magic. \u00a0He continued to be in a defenseless position. \u00a0Of course, his stealth magic was so great that it couldn\u2019t be penetrated unless one had the Read All Creation ability\u2026..</span></p><br/><p><span>[Etna.]</span></p><br/><p><span>[Yes, he really is annoying in my opinion.]</span></p><br/><p><span>Etna was sharing his Read All Creation ability, so she caught sight of the enemy. \u00a0He was making every effort to destroy the hand of destruction with his magic, but the hand was blocking all his attempts. \u00a0She could see that he was growing angry.</span></p><br/><p><span>[We have to give up on the idea that we can kill him outright. \u00a0Before he picks up on it, we have to focus on dealing as much damage to his body. \u00a0He is a master that knows our magic better than anyone else.]</span></p><br/><p><span>[How do you know this\u2026.? \u00a0Never mind. \u00a0I understand. \u00a0I have to minimize my use of my magic, and I have to deal a fatal blow?]</span></p><br/><p><span>However, their foe was too far for him to leave the battle to the close range fighters of his party. \u00a0Unfortunately, Mycenae was still lacking in terms of damage when it came to single burst attacks.</span></p><br/><p><span>This was why the task fell onto Etna. \u00a0Etna was the only one in the party that dealt with magic that wasn\u2019t truly magic.</span></p><br/><p><span>[Alright. \u00a0I\u2019ll show you how it is done.]</span></p><br/><p><span>Etna activated her Innate ability. \u00a0If it was a simple spell, it would have been detected by her opponent. \u00a0However, her Innate ability was Spirit Transformation. \u00a0It was an ability that hadn\u2019t existed hundreds of years ago when the previous Demon King and the previous hero had run amok.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAt the very least, I\u2019ll take one arm!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>[Koo-huhk?]</span></p><br/><p><span>This was why the Demon Nanarai Bodra couldn\u2019t respond to the suddenly surging white flame. \u00a0Etna had transformed into a Fire Spirit. \u00a0As soon as he saw her, he immediately created a barrier. \u00a0However, Etna had kept her words. \u00a0She had already burned away his entire arm!</span></p><br/><p><span>[Koohk, koo-ha-ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!]</span></p><br/><p><span>He hadn\u2019t felt pain for a very long time. \u00a0The Demon screamed as he grabbed his shoulder. \u00a0Artpe spoke as he watched the face, which had been distorted by pain. \u00a0There was a cold smile on his lips.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI believe this is the first time we\u2019ve met directly, sunbae-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSunbae-nim\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7? \u00a0Huh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The rest of the party finally realized what had caused that sense of incongruity. \u00a0From the moment he had appeared, the Demon had spoken like a know it all asshole. \u00a0He was Nanarai Bodra. \u00a0He was the previous hero that had periodically helped Artpe\u2019s party by leaving behind vestiges of his legacy.</span></p><br/><p><span>There was distinct pattern to his Demonic energy, and he had overwhelming power. \u00a0He also possessed an overwhelming presence and level. \u00a0He had reached an absurdly high level of 403.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>Finally, the name that was being shown through Artpe\u2019s eyes proved his identity.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhy\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhy is he attacking us? \u00a0Does he have dementia? \u00a0Does he not know that we are heroes?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo, he knows it. \u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe looked at the enraged Demon, who was pointing his remaining arm towards them.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHowever, everything else within his head might have rotted away.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>[A party of two heroes\u2026. \u00a0It is quite the familiar sight. \u00a0It also makes me yearn for the good old days. \u00a0I also fought for the humans once.]</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe let out a bitter laughter as he spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt isn\u2019t too late to return to our side.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>[It is too late, young hero. \u00a0My juniors\u2026. \u00a0 Do you know about the weight of time? \u00a0Do you know about the weight of death? I\u2019ve spent too long a time as a Demon, and I am too used to it now. \u00a0The Demonic energy stole many things from me, but as a price, it breathed in new desires within me.]</span></p><br/><p><span>At the old former hero\u2019s words, Artpe snorted.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou and your party had enough power to kill the previous Demon King. \u00a0Despite that fact, you chose to seal the previous Demon King. \u00a0Am I wrong?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>[No. \u00a0At the time, our party didn\u2019t have the power to kill the Demon King. \u00a0We could only seal the Demon King.]</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou might have been able to convince your party members, but your lies won\u2019t work on me. \u00a0I know that your ability is more geared towards attacking rather than sealing. \u00a0Why did you do it? \u00a0You don\u2019t like using your sealing ability since it is mundane. \u00a0You prefer to use flashy attacks. \u00a0Am I right?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe approached it from an angle that was unimaginable to a normal person. \u00a0Nanaria Bodra flinched at Artpe\u2019s words, and he took a step backwards.</span></p><br/><p><span>[H\u2026.how did you know\u2026.]</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAh. \u00a0This asshole is an idiot.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI see. \u00a0He really is an idiot.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe didn\u2019t give him time to respond. \u00a0He pushed ahead.</span></p><br/><p><span>[I wondered why you sealed the Demon King instead of killing him. \u00a0The reason was quite simple. \u00a0At that point, you were already drawn towards the Demonic energy. \u00a0You were drawn towards becoming a Demon. \u00a0You said you turned yourself into a Demon, and that it was for research. \u00a0You planned on searching for a way to turn the Demonic energy back into Mana. \u00a0However, you were merely trying to make an excuse. \u00a0You tricked yourself into accepting your true nature.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>[\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.]</span></p><br/><p><span>He was silent for a brief moment before he opened his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span>[It is truly a great deductive reasoning. \u00a0Unfortunately, you are wrong, my junior.]</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019m wrong?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>His eyes let out a bright light. \u00a0Demonic energy overflowed as it strengthened his old body. \u00a0If Etna hadn\u2019t destroyed one arm, he might have been able to push the hero\u2019s party. \u00a0That was how fierce his power was! \u00a0As he raised his fighting spirit, he yelled out!</span></p><br/><p><span>[The reason why I sealed her is simple. \u00a0I was in love with her! \u00a0I sealed her, and I dedicated my whole life in finding a way to revert her back into being a human. \u00a0I was able to meet her again when the world was rewound. \u00a0My way of thinking had been wrong from the start. \u00a0The ones that were in the right were the Demons!]</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe was struck dumb. \u00a0He quietly nodded his head. \u00a0The previous Demon King was a woman. \u00a0It was a good information to know.</span></p><br/><p><span>The story he had heard from the Elven elders from the Forest of Eternity came to mind. \u00a0The previous hero had hit on many Elven women, so this explanation was very direct. \u00a0Maybe, that story was foreshadowing this moment. \u00a0It was an entirely believable explanation.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHe\u2019s an idiot that can\u2019t be cured.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes, let\u2019s kill him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Everyone was in agreement. \u00a0Nanarai Bodra was Maetel\u2019s ancestor, and at the same time, he had a big influence in allowing Artpe\u2019s party to grow so much. \u00a0This was why they had decided to listen to his story a little bit more. \u00a0However, they had found out that Nanarai Bodra didn\u2019t know his ass from his forehead.</span></p><br/><p><span>Moreover, Artpe suspected this when Nanarai Bodra had shown up as an ally to the previous Demon King. \u00a0It seemed he had lost a significant portion of his memories throughout the long years. \u00a0If he hadn\u2019t, he would have know about the power of the ruins he had created. \u00a0He would have recovered the three Evil Hearts that he had put in safekeeping.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018He is unstable.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>The magic that turned humans into Demons wasn\u2019t complete. \u00a0This was quite evident. \u00a0If it was complete, the previous Demon King\u2019s faction wouldn\u2019t be having such a difficult time turning humans into Demon after being released from their seal. \u00a0This also applied to Nanarai Bodra.</span></p><br/><p><span>[I realized what the correct path was. \u00a0Demonic energy isn't a twisted form of Mana. \u00a0It is an evolved form of Mana, and it is the future we should strive for. \u00a0I\u2019ve been rejecting the existence of Demons all my life. \u00a0She fixed my way of thinking. \u00a0The existence of the Demonic god gives legitimacy to the Demonic energy. \u00a0It is superior to Mana!]</span></p><br/><p><span>The bastard was completely twisted in the mind. \u00a0At the very least, he had wanted to pay his respects to his sunbae, who had walked a much higher road in magic. \u00a0However, that ship had sailed. \u00a0Nanarai Bodra didn\u2019t care about the Demonic energy or Mana. \u00a0He only cared about power and fear. \u00a0Once he started worshipping the Demonic god, his career as a mage had come to an end.</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe was cold as he gave his orders.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cEtna, you\u2019ll be the main one to attack. \u00a0I\u2019ll focus on weakening them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat about me, Artpe?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou can take on the remaining group. Regina, may you protect the party?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe didn\u2019t need to say anything further. \u00a0They knew what to do. \u00a0The party\u2019s expression hardened all at once. \u00a0Sine Nanarai Bodra had come out, there was only one person left that had yet to make an appearance!</span></p><br/><p><span>[You are a quite the sensible kid. \u00a0You are different from the previous hero. \u00a0Moreover, you are cute.]</span></p><br/><p><span>A slightly sweet voice could be heard from somewhere. \u00a0Nanarai Bodra\u2019s face glowed as he looked up. \u00a0Artpe gritted his teeth.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7if you lay your hands on Artpe, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo, she just threw those words out there instead of greeting us. \u00a0Don\u2019t be baited by her, Maetel\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>[Hoo hoo. \u00a0As expected, this is fun. \u00a0The twisted hero and the two heroes\u2026. \u00a0This is the best stage that I can offer him.]</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe let lout a low sigh as he raised his head.</span></p><br/><p><span>He saw a blindingly beautiful woman with black hair. \u00a0The previous Demon King made her appearance.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

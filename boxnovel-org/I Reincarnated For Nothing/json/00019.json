The Undead, who tried to test the heroes, had run out of all its opportunities.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It hadn\u2019t even been able to put up a good fight. \u00a0It hadn\u2019t been able to use its secret technique. \u00a0It had been unable to give its cool final line nor was it able to lecture the heroes. \u00a0It had pathetically frozen in place before it was able to punish Artpe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEh-eet.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Meanwhile, Maetel was being sensible by distancing herself from the Death Knight. \u00a0If she killed the Death Knight right now, its power would be transferred into the Zombies and Ghouls. \u00a0They would harden to a point where the they wouldn\u2019t be able to handle them. \u00a0She had arrived at a very logical conclusion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo, Maetel!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel was patting herself on the back when Artpe gave her instructions to the contrary.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf that bastard kills itself in a suicide, our reward will become infinitely worse! \u00a0We don\u2019t want to receive dropped items from really high level Zombies or Ghouls! \u00a0We want the dropped items of a Death Knight created from gathering all the energy through Record Link! \u00a0You have to prevent it from killing itself!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, all right! \u00a0As expected, Artpe is smart!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Who in the world would call these wicked people as being heroes! \u00a0\u00a0They were superbly rotten to the core that even the Demon King would come study under their tutelage!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Death Knight watched Maetel break through the flood of monsters falling from the sky, and she immediately disarmed it. \u00a0\u00a0It was vexed that it couldn\u2019t move to stop her, but Artpe had killed an excessive amount of cursed monsters. \u00a0It was hard for the Death Knight to even lift a single finger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Cheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaapppppppppppppppppppppppp\u2026\u2026..]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. \u00a0It is game over for it since the curse has stacked this much. \u00a0Maetel, you should now help me kill the others.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had descended this Dungeon for the past year, so they were well versed in what to do now. \u00a0There were a lot of monsters tied to the Record Link right now. \u00a0It was as if someone had barfed them all up. \u00a0It was a good thing Artpe and Maetel had faced all of them before while they came down here. If not, they wouldn\u2019t have stood a chance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEh-eet, eh-eet.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Ooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhng.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Ggeeeeeeeeeeeee, ggeeeeeeeeeeeeee.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Death Knight didn\u2019t tie himself to so many beings so that it would die after twitching slowly across the ground like a cicada larva. \u00a0\u00a0Of course, Artpe and Maetel didn\u2019t care about that!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel had made sure to cripple the Death Knight so it couldn\u2019t kill itself. \u00a0Then she put away her sword as she beat the nearby monsters to death using a bone club.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe hummed as he controlled the shield. \u00a0By the time he killed all of them, the shield would become unusable. \u00a0\u00a0However, this shield was only useful for this Dungeon. \u00a0He didn\u2019t care what happened to it after this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are really a genius, Artpe.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, I do think I'm somewhat of a genius. \u00a0Maetel is also quite the genius.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThank you! \u00a0I think I fought fairly well even if I say so myself!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two heroes kept praising each other as they cleared the Dungeon in a friendly manner. The Death Knight was rolling around on the floor like a larvae, so what could mere Zombies and Ghouls do against them! \u00a0\u00a0It was as if they were hit by lightning!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The lucky ones died immediately after they hit the floor. \u00a0The unlucky ones already had the misfortune of being Undead, yet they were in a situation where they couldn\u2019t even move properly. \u00a0They were only able to blink their eyes until it was their turn to die.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Goo-ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was unknown as to who had created this Dungeon, but at the very least, the creator of this Dungeon probably didn\u2019t place the Record Link expecting to see such a sight! \u00a0This wasn\u2019t a Dungeon that was meant to grow candidates for becoming the Demon King! \u00a0This was a place built to develop heroes! \u00a0\u00a0It was the builder\u2019s mistake in assuming that all heroes were goody two shoes pushovers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Ah. \u00a0Ahhhhhhhhh\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Death Knight had lost both its arms, and it had been completely disarmed. \u00a0As it rolled around the floor, the Death Knight watched the two evil heroes clear the Zombies and Ghouls.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Every time one of the Undead died, a minuscule amount of power was coming in towards the Death Knight. \u00a0Most of them were cursed, so it was a scary proposition where the slowdown effect was much higher than the strengthening effect. \u00a0It had lost the power to move around a long time ago, and now it was having a hard time thinking.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Death Knighted lamented over its misfortune. \u00a0It had failed to read Artpe\u2019s outrageous abilities, so it mocked itself on its own ignorance. \u00a0It moaned at the sight of the broken Dungeon. \u00a0The Death Knight wondered if it could really entrust it all to them\u2026...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It decided not to think about it anymore.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Four days passed. \u00a0It took a long time even though the two were killing defenseless monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From the midpoint on, the records of monsters had started to overlap too much. \u00a0\u00a0From that point on, the constitution of the remaining Undead became unnecessarily high. \u00a0This was why it was taking so long. \u00a0The only danger that posed a threat to the two heroes was them becoming too tired, and falling asleep in front of the monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDid we really kill all of them?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, we killed every single one of them. \u00a0We even killed the ones stuck up there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, I also confirmed it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This Dungeon was ridiculously large and deep. \u00a0It took him around 30 minutes to sweep the place for monsters that were still alive with his Read All Creation ability.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, it was all over now. \u00a0There was only one monster left in the entire Dungeon. \u00a0It was the Death Knight that was only capable of rolling around on the floor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHmmm.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe wanted to ask if it wanted have its last words, but there was no response from the Death Knight even after Artpe pounded on it. \u00a0It was acting like a normal corpse.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cArtpe, you have to kill it. \u00a0Currently, my level is too high compared to yours. \u00a0We have to balance it out.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI knew you would say that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe raised his shield. \u00a0He had killed numerous monsters with it so it was damaged and deformed. \u00a0It was hard to call it a shield now. \u00a0It was basically a lump of metal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wondered if the Death Knight would be satisfied with being killed by a lump of metal, which was neither a weapon nor a defensive gear. \u00a0Of course, it was \u00a0no concern of his.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKoohk. \u00a0Eh-eet. \u00a0Crap. \u00a0It is so damn hard.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe diligently pounded the Death Knight with the lump of metal. \u00a0However, the Death Knight had absorbed all the records to reach its final form, so it wouldn\u2019t die from an attack of that caliber. \u00a0Artpe had no choice, but to forcefully push his Mana into the lump of metal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you don\u2019t die from this, I\u2019ll call you my teacher!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He placed the lump of metal beneath the Death Knight\u2019s body, and he immediately used the Hyper Rubbing spell. The lump of metal rubbed against the Death Knight with a ludicrous amount of force!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It couldn't be helped. \u00a0The surface of the Death Knight\u2019s body touching the lump of metal was starting to fracture a little bit. \u00a0It was a brutal sight! \u00a0It made one wonder if this was some new form of torture!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Go-oooooooooooooooh.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed the Death Knight wanted to say something, but its reaction had slowed down too much. \u00a0One couldn\u2019t tell what it was trying to say. \u00a0Artpe wanted to end its misery, so he increased his Mana output. \u00a0The rubbing became more fierce, and it was accompanied by a change.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. \u00a0The lump of metal is becoming red-hot!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s a Mana reaction. \u00a0That lump of metal used to be an Artifact. The Mana infused within it will become agitated by the Mana I injected. \u00a0It\u2019ll cause an explosion. \u00a0The explosion caused by detonating an Artifact is much stronger than detonating a simple rock. \u00a0You should keep that in mind.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen why did you activate the Hyper Rubbing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI just wanted to tease that bastard\u2026. \u00a0\u00a0Duck!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, the lump of metal exploded! \u00a0The Death Knight received the entirety of the incredible force generated by the explosion. \u00a0As a result, it was able to find its eternal rest. It probably would have been much happier by the fact that it was taken out this way.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKoo-ooooooooooooooooh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKoohp.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was obvious, but an incredible amount of EXP entered into Artpe and Maetel when the Death Knight was killed. The primary form of the completed Death Knight had been incredible already, but the Dungeon had been restored to its original form. \u00a0All the record of the monsters were gathered into a single being! \u00a0\u00a0This result was to be expected.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cArtpe. \u00a0It feels as if my head is going to split open-ahhhhh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDon\u2019t worry. \u00a0I feel the same way\u2026. \u00a0Koo-heek.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even in his previous life, he had never experience such successive level ups. \u00a0Mana filled up within his body as it kept evolving. \u00a0It put a great amount of stress on his mind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUghhh, Artpe.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe was trying to hold back the urge to lose consciousness when he heard Maetel calling for him. \u00a0He raised his head to respond to her when he realized why she had called out to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWow. \u00a0This is nuts.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGgoo-oooooooooh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maybe, the killing of all the Monsters connected to the Record link was the impetus. \u00a0The Dungeon was once again going through a change!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If more monsters came out once again, it would have been really annoying. \u00a0Fortunately, this wasn\u2019t the case. The Dungeon was quickly losing its size. \u00a0The square was also getting smaller, and the material making up the Dungeon was changing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is as if\u2026.. \u00a0\u00a0Ah.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The cherry on top was the fountain that appeared in the middle of the square. \u00a0Maetel\u2019s body and mind was tired, so she was about to let out a shout of joy. \u00a0As she was about to run towards the clear water, she paused to look back at Artpe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat\u2019s poisoned water, right! \u00a0Aren\u2019t I right, Artpe!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She thought she had shown sound judgment by stopping, so Maetel let out a fake cough.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He put on a bright smile as he faced her. \u00a0He spoke to her..</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNope, that is just regular water.\u201d</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

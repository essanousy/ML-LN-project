\u00a0Why are the Demon race stronger than the human race? \u00a0It is because the Demons are in the right. \u00a0That should be the direction we should be moving towards. \u00a0The gods spoken by humans do not interfere with our lives. \u00a0They just observe. \u00a0The Demonic god willingly gives us his power!]</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBullshit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He could see why the current Demon King had despised Garnet. \u00a0Garnet was a lunatic. \u00a0She was basically a representation of the group of humans that had dreamed about Demonificiation of this world.</span></p><br/><p><span>Evil was capable of existing between humans. \u00a0However, it was impossible for good to exist amongst the Demons. \u00a0The current Demon King had loved the struggle between good and evil. \u00a0He had taken this love to the extreme, but even so he was similar to humans in how he had acted.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNyaa. \u00a0I\u2019m into men. \u00a0Nyaa.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>[Cute child. \u00a0Why don\u2019t you show me everything you are hiding? \u00a0The Evil Hearts are noble treasures. \u00a0It seems you\u2019ve swallowed all of them. \u00a0Right? \u00a0Am I right?]</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNyaaaaaaa!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Roa realized that Garnet was aiming for her. \u00a0She quickly dodged.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNyaa. \u00a0I don\u2019t know what you are talking about! \u00a0I digested it all, so I have nothing!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>[The essence of that power can\u2019t disappear. \u00a0Yes. \u00a0You were chosen! \u00a0Your body was chosen for the advent of the Demonic god!]</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cMaster, this woman is weird. \u00a0Nyaa-ah-ah! \u00a0Nyaa-nyaa-ah!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Roa kept jumping away from the hands that was trying to catch her. \u00a0However, Garnet was much faster than her. \u00a0Roa was close to being caught. \u00a0Maetel acted right on time as she used her Acceleration ability. \u00a0She roughly pushed aside Roa as she attacked Garnetl. \u00a0However, it was as if Garnet had been waiting for Maetel. \u00a0She had a bewitching smile on her face as she broke the Magic Stone in her hand.</span></p><br/><p><span>[You should help me, child.]</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKoohk\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7!?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cMaetel!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The Magic Stone possessed a spell that strengthened her Innate ability!? \u00a0In a flash, Maetel\u2019s body froze. \u00a0In the next moment, Maetel was able to rebuff the Demonic energy. \u00a0However, it caused Maetel and her entire party to be knocked backwards. \u00a0Garnet took a step forward in the air. \u00a0In front of her eyes, she could see Roa. \u00a0Roa\u2019s hackles were raised. \u00a0Her body had frozen in place when she was confronted with the strengthened Innate ability of Garnet.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to face me before you can do that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>[Mmm\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7?]</span></p><br/><p><span>Garnet was trying to procure Roa. \u00a0At that moment, Aria revealed herself. \u00a0It seemed she had always been there. \u00a0She was much weaker than Maetel, but Garnet\u2019s Innate ability was based on Demonic energy. \u00a0Therefore, Aria didn\u2019t falter.</span></p><br/><p><span>[Holy Priestess? \u00a0I see. \u00a0You are the second Holy Priestess. \u00a0Your ability to hide is peerless, but what can you do?]</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI can protect those that I must protect. \u00a0I was given the power of the Holy Priestess, and this power is for everyone.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>A golden light shone from Aria\u2019s eyes. \u00a0Garnet gritted her teeth. \u00a0Aria\u2019s power was overwhelming when compared to the Holy Priestess from her era. \u00a0The power of the gods had been divided into two holy priestesses, yet she was unbelievably strong.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIn the end, your Demonic energy is a form of Mana. \u00a0Artpe-nim told us this. \u00a0You won\u2019t be able to touch Roa until you destroy all of my soul.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It would have been impossible without the Declaration of Demonic Extermination and the Reclamation magic. Aria was able to use her Innate ability Assimilation to absorb Garnet\u2019s Demonic energy. \u00a0Garnet\u2019s boundless Demonic energy was being turned into Holy energy. \u00a0Her eyes widened when the Holy energy started to suppress her Demonic energy.</span></p><br/><p><span>[All of your powers are considered to be so excessive that only one should exist in the world at a given time. \u00a0However, all your powers have been gathered in one place. \u00a0Ah ah. \u00a0The weak gods were afraid of the Demonic god, so they sent all of them here!]</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI feel pity for you! \u00a0You are hanging onto an illusion called the Demonic god!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Aria was sucking in Garnet\u2019s Demonic energy, and she was making it her own. \u00a0This allowed Maetel to overcome Garnet\u2019s Seduction ability. \u00a0She was successful in moving again! \u00a0She swung her bastard sword. \u00a0Garnet had to use one of Nanarai\u2019s Magic Stones to block the attack. \u00a0Garnet bared her teeth.</span></p><br/><p><span>[You saw the evidence of the Demonic god\u2019s power, yet you are unable to recognize it\u2026 \u00a0 After several hundred years, we were able to create the Demon realm. \u00a0Now you are trying to turn it back into a human realm. \u00a0You are metabolizing the Demonic energy to return it to Mana.]</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDodge, Maetel!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Arpte retrieved Roa using Blink. \u00a0He yelled out in shock when he saw the amount of Demonic energy surging forward from Garnet\u2019s body. \u00a0Fortunately, he had given his warning in time. \u00a0Maetel grabbed Aria, and she retreated.</span></p><br/><p><span>[This is all the delusion of foolish children!]</span></p><br/><p><span>In the next moment, the Demonic energy detonated! \u00a0Even Regina\u2019s barrier couldn\u2019t neutralize all of the attack. \u00a0The shockwave washed over the region. \u00a0In the middle of the crater, one could see the figure of Garnet once again. \u00a0Her skin had been dyed black.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cShit. \u00a0It really feels as if the world is going to end\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIsn\u2019t that woman basically the Demonic god? \u00a0How rotten! \u00a0There is no sign of her own energy left within her body\u2026...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Demonic energy, Demonic energy, Demonic energy. \u00a0It was an enormous amount of Demonic energy. \u00a0It was at a point where her body might not be able to withstand the presence of so much Demonic energy. \u00a0If the Demonic energy hadn\u2019t been reduced by the power of the Reclamation magic and the Declaration of Demonic Extermination, the Demonic energy would have overwhelmed the whole world!</span></p><br/><p><span>[You can try to revert everything, but there will always be the possibility of everything being turned back into Demonic energy again. \u00a0Isn\u2019t this what you have demonstrated with all of this? \u00a0Demonic energy is one with the Mana. \u00a0Mana turning into Demonic energy is part of the natural flow. \u00a0Even the gods you follow and believe can\u2019t deny this fact! \u00a0Humans seek to become stronger. \u00a0All humans want a new order under the Demonic god!]</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNyaa-ah. \u00a0That woman is crazy. \u00a0Nyaa-ah-ah.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Roa whispered her words as she remained in Artpe\u2019s arms. \u00a0It was such a desperate situation that one had to wonder if her words were necessary.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHowever, there is some truth to her words. \u00a0Roa, you made the Evil Hearts your own by eating it. \u00a0However, that woman has the Magic Stones that\u2019ll turn your Mana into Demonic energy\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNyaaa. \u00a0If my Mana keeps changing into Demonic energy, does that mean I can constantly eat it? \u00a0Nyaa-ah-ah.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>She really was wired in a weird and happy-go-lucky way. \u00a0After he told her that was not how it worked, he raised his head. \u00a0The sight he had seen once before was unfolding in front of his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>[You are the new owner of the Evil Heart. \u00a0I pity you, beast. \u00a0You should stay put. \u00a0I gave you the opportunity to worship the Demonic god, yet you refused it \u2026.. \u00a0 All of you have rejected him!]</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cO...oh no! \u00a0Maetel!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The Demonic energy coming off from Garnet\u2019s body was arranged in a particular pattern. \u00a0It looked extremely familiar, and in the next moment, Artpe realized that the current Demon King had activated a similar magic circle to what the current Demon King used. \u00a0Artpe wondered if Nanarai Bodra had engraved the magic circle on the Demon King\u2019s body. \u00a0Artpe was probably right.</span></p><br/><p><span>[Until the end, Nanarai wanted to stop me from doing this. \u00a0He was the one that opened the road to the Demonic god, so I respected his wishes. \u00a0I determined it wouldn\u2019t be too late to enact this plan after we recovered the Evil Heart. \u00a0I no longer think that. \u00a0I have no reason to hesitate any more. \u00a0I follow the Demonic god\u2019s wishes! \u00a0That is why the Demonic energy obeys me!]</span></p><br/><p><span>The past Demon King was adding the power of the Magic Stones. \u00a0These Magic Stones were given to her by Nanarai Bodra. \u00a0She was letting out an overwhelming amount of power as she activated the magic circle\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span>[I\u2019ll just host the Demonic god in my body!]</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOh no, you don\u2019t!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Maetel charged forward. \u00a0She was borrowing half the strength and stamina of her party excluding Artpe. \u00a0She gathered everyone\u2019s magical energy, and she strengthened it once more. \u00a0At the end, she placed her Innate ability over that power. \u00a0It was as if lightning was falling from the sky.</span></p><br/><p><span>[Hero, it is fate that I am sharing this moment with you. \u00a0When the Demonic god descends, everything will be changed into Demonic energy. \u00a0I\u2019ll use everything you\u2019ve prepared to dye this world with Demonic energy!]</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKoohk\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u00a0This won\u2019t do! \u00a0It isn\u2019t enough\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHoo-ahhhhhhp!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe infused the power of his Reclamation and Materialization magic into the Mana Strings. \u00a0He shot the Mana Strings towards Garnet. \u00a0He wanted to weaken her Demonic energy even by a little bit. \u00a0He somehow had to stop her from activating her spell.</span></p><br/><p><span>He had already seen the structure of the spell that Garnet was trying to manifest. \u00a0There must be a way to mess up the spell without killing her. \u00a0There must be a way to turn it into nothing! \u00a0He was sure that he already knew this method. \u00a0It must be possible\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cArtpe!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>At that moment, Silpennon threw a Magic Stone towards Artpe. \u00a0Artpe desperately snatched it out of the air. \u00a0When he checked what it was, he realized it was one of the Magic Stones plundered from Garnet by Silpennon. \u00a0He could see the magic circle engraved within it\u2026.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSilpennon, you are the best!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cJust hurry up and solve this mess!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>[Stay still, my children. Just show reverence to the Demonic god. \u00a0Worship him!]</span></p><br/><p><span>Was it caused by the flooding of the Demonic energy? \u00a0Her Innate ability was being severely boosted. \u00a0However, it didn\u2019t work on Artpe and Silpennon. \u00a0Their feelings couldn\u2019t be shaken by an outside source. \u00a0That time was long past.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAlright. \u00a0Let\u2019s do this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe held Nanarai Bodra\u2019s Magic Stone. \u00a0It held the ability of [Strengthen Innate Ability]. \u00a0He followed Garnet\u2019s example. \u00a0He crushed the Magic Stone with his hand.</span></p><br/><p><span>At that moment, he could hear a voice in his ears. \u00a0He had no idea whose voice it was. \u00a0The voice was soft, and it brought up sentimental feelings within him.</span></p><br/><p><span>[Innate Ability - Read All Creation Ability 2nd Stage : Rewrite(Revision) has been completely released.]</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe finally understood it at that moment.</span></p><br/><p><span>He now knew why he was able to return to the past. \u00a0He knew why he was able to turn into a human. \u00a0He also realized why he was placed next to Maetel of all places. \u00a0He realized why he was able to acquire the Materialization magic.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cShit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>If he had been able to keep a clear mind during his death in his past life, he would have be able to awaken to his ability at a much earlier date. \u00a0His only regret was the fact that he hadn\u2019t realized it sooner.</span></p><br/><p><span>However, it wasn\u2019t too late.</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe held power within his hands.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a power that couldn\u2019t be prepared by the Demon King\u2019s recipe. \u00a0It was an absolute power that was beyond what the Demon King could imagine. .</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cRewrite.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe quietly intoned his words as he opened his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>[Wait a minute. \u00a0This is\u2026. \u00a0 Oh, Demonic god! \u00a0Please show us your power\u2026...!]</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou are too late, previous Demon King.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe grinned as he spoke those words. \u00a0His eyes let out a bright purple light.</span></p><br/><p><span>Everything within his sight was the subject to his power.</span></p><br/><p><span>His supreme Innate ability of Revision was implemented.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

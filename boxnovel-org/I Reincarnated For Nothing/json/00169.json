background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was simple as to the reason why Petra was powerful. \u00a0His mere presence froze his surrounding, and a basic debuff was applied to his enemies by the environment created by him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Artpe\u2019s party had Regina, so she was able to stop most of the adverse effect of Petra\u2019s cold energy. \u00a0Despite her doing this, Artpe\u2019s party could feel frost starting to form on their skin. \u00a0It proved that Petra hadn\u2019t acquired the Four Heavenly King title through mere chance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As always, Maetel was about to unsheathe her bastard sword. \u00a0However, Artpe pulled out a longsword from his belongings. \u00a0It was the sword gifted to Artpe by Etna. \u00a0She had put the power of her fire into this sword, and she had asked him not to give this sword to Maetel. \u00a0It was only for his use.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Artpe had used three consecutive Reinforcement on the sword. \u00a0Then he had used the magic stones he had gathered over time to complete the 4th Reinforcement. \u00a0He was able to upgrade his sword to hellfire status. \u00a0The fire from the past was like a candle flame compared to the current flame.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Petra knew his barrier hadn\u2019t failed, because the fire sword was excellent. \u00a0His control hadn\u2019t dipped either. \u00a0It was happening, because a similar yet different cold energy was competing with his own power. \u00a0His domain was being taken away by the presence of another magician.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

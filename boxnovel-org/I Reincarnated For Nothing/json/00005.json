Artpe had been inwardly worried about a highly skilled adventurer or a thief, who could neutralize his perception, catching them by surprise. \u00a0However, a refreshing morning arrived without the need for Artpe to use his contingency plan 1, 2, 3 and 4. \u00a0Of course, they were in a Dungeon, so they couldn\u2019t check whether it was light outside!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGood morning, Artpe!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI don\u2019t know if it is is morning yet, and I also don\u2019t know if it is a good one, but hello.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Maetel opened her eyes, she had confirmed that Artpe was sleeping safely next to her. \u00a0She let out a bright smile before she took stock of herself. \u00a0Her eyes widened in surprise.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWow. \u00a0We slept on floor, yet my body feels really great.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Mana inside a Dungeon is extremely active. \u00a0It has a positive effect on one\u2019s vitals. \u00a0However, we aren\u2019t the only living being in this place, and that is a problem.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Most monster, who entered a Dungeon, became much stronger. \u00a0Of course, this increased the EXP one could gain. \u00a0Still, it was scary to face these fortified monsters. \u00a0This was why most adventurers and mercenaries was reluctant to enter a Dungeon. \u00a0In truth, if one wanted to live a long life, it was best not to enter a Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs this why you insisted on entering the Dungeon? \u00a0Since we\u2019ve slept and refreshed ourselves, can\u2019t we just head out?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe could. \u00a0However, the soldiers dispatched from the palace would have expanded their search radius by now. \u00a0If we go out right now, we\u2019ll be caught. \u00a0We\u2019ll be dragged back into the palace.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI don\u2019t like tasteless food!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She could deal with wearing shoddy clothes, and not being able to sleep. \u00a0However, she wanted to avoid not being able eat good food at all cost. \u00a0There were tears in Maetel\u2019s eyes as she shouted those words. Artpe nodded his head in satisfactions, and he handed her the leather waterskin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. \u00a0After we drink some water, let\u2019s work hard to catch the monsters in here. \u00a0By the time we are able to go out again, we\u2019ll be stronger. \u00a0When we exit the Dungeon, we\u2019ll be able to easily evade the soldiers pursuing us.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the cheapest part about being a hero. \u00a0Maetel had been a normal child only a day ago. \u00a0Before she became a hero, she had merely been the leader of a group of children, who she played with. \u00a0If things continued as they were progressing right now, she would be more skillful than the soldiers that were being killed like flies in the current war. \u00a0She would be able to look down upon them!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a common saying within the Demon world. \u00a0Yesterday\u2019s defeated hero will kill you tomorrow. \u00a0Of course, the idiots within the Demon world ignored this saying, and they were killed and looted by the hero like clock-work. \u00a0The biggest problem was the chef\u2026</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Demon King was the biggest idiot amongst them!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo we have to fight those weird goblins again, Artpe?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo, we\u2019ll be fighting something much weirder. \u00a0They are also stronger.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHeeek!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When she thought about the fight against the goblins yesterday, she shrank into herself. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Artpe had seen her remarkably learn four skills at once in yesterday\u2019s battle. \u00a0He thought about how she looked yesterday, and he gravely nodded his head. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are capable of fighting opponents that are 10 levels above you. \u00a0If you aren\u2019t careless, you\u2019ll be able to win easily, so don\u2019t worry too much about it. \u00a0I\u2019m also capable to a certain extent.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He most definitely felt the difference in yesterday's battle with the goblins. \u00a0When Artpe was part of the Demon race, it didn\u2019t matter how great an ability he had possessed. \u00a0He had a hard time distinguishing himself with his limited talent. \u00a0Now he was born as a human, and he had acquired the Hero Class. \u00a0His situation had changed drastically.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIn the Demon world, there are no weak monsters like this\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou even know about the Demon world. \u00a0Artpe is amazing.!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI read about it from a book...a book.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The monsters from the Demon world were inherently outstanding at Mana detection, and they possessed a high Mana resistance. \u00a0If one manifested Mana to attack those types of monsters, it wouldn\u2019t work. \u00a0Yesterday, Artpe had infused a portion of his Mana into a rock, and he had thrown it. \u00a0He also used threads of Mana to detect the approach of his enemies. \u00a0These methods would have never work against the monsters from the Demon world.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he was in the realm of the humans now. \u00a0There were countless monsters here that could be killed using such simple methods. \u00a0He didn\u2019t have to level up, and acquire proper magic spells. \u00a0Any magic spells that dealt with direct manipulation of magic could be mimicked with his control over Mana. \u00a0He would be able to create a similar effect!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWow. \u00a0Can all magicians do that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThey can, but they don\u2019t bother using it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The reason being it looked cooler to chant a spell, and the destructive power one could inflict was higher with a spell. \u00a0Of course, these weren\u2019t the only reasons why Mana manipulation wasn\u2019t used by others. \u00a0If Artpe didn\u2019t have his Innate Ability, Read All Creation, he wouldn't be able to figure out his opponent\u2019s tendencies ahead of time. \u00a0He wouldn\u2019t be able to properly respond with his Mana.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe hadn\u2019t really given a detailed explanation about his Innate Ability to Maetel. \u00a0Despite that fact, she passively accepted everything he said by saying, \u2018Artpe is amazing!\u2019 \u00a0This was why there was no need to give a more thorough explanation. \u00a0If he said it, she believed it!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is scary, but I\u2019ll do my best, Artpe!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBefore we do anything...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While Maetel was tilting her head in confusion, Artpe unhesitatingly strode towards the bottom step of the stairway connected to the entrance to the Dungeon. \u00a0He gathered Mana into his hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs there a monster there, Artpe!?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe\u2019s hand knocked on the riser of the bottom step. \u00a0The stair reacted to the Mana, and it opened up like a drawer. \u00a0A large wooden box appeared. \u00a0Maetel\u2019s eyes turned round. \u00a0Artpe had a delighted expression on his face. \u00a0He laughed as he turned to look at Maetel.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHowever, there is a treasure box here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cArtpe is really amazing!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, I\u2019m amazing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As always, Artpe didn\u2019t stop Maetel from giving him praise.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the past, this single ability allowed him to rise to the seat of the Four Heavenly Kings! \u00a0Artpe was feeling good, so he decided to be a little bit more kind in his explanation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMost Dungeons have something called a Starter Set. \u00a0These are for the fugitives, who were chased into the Dungeons, without knowing anything about the Dungeons. \u00a0However, these people are being chased. \u00a0They don\u2019t have the luxury to search for secret locations.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStill, if they are lucky, they might be able to find it. \u00a0So who made these preparations? \u00a0I\u2019m sure it was a kind person, who doesn\u2019t want unsuspecting people to die within the Dungeons.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKind person?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe grinned. \u00a0The hero\u2019s way of thinking was still too soft. \u00a0She was soft like a warm pudding that was freshly made!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe beginner\u2019s equipment isn\u2019t called beginner\u2019s equipment for nothing. \u00a0It\u2019ll break after couple swings. \u00a0There is nothing here that can be used for the duration of couple days. \u00a0On top of that, it is very difficult to acquire additional equipments in the Dungeon unless one is experienced in traversing such Dungeons. \u00a0Usually, the people, who were lucky enough to find the beginner\u2019s equipment, are more likely to enter the Dungeon in high spirits. \u00a0It gives them a false sense of confidence. \u00a0This is the reason why most of them die.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cD...does that apply to us!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt doesn\u2019t, because we are heroes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI see!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe gave another explanation, and Maetel once again accepted that explanation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This is why it is easy to have a dummy by one\u2019s side!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFirst, let\u2019s equip you with all of this. \u00a0This rusted steel sword will break after swing it exactly 186 times. \u00a0Ah, that number decreases by half if you imbue it with mana, hit a monster with a level difference of five or hit a monster\u2019s bone. \u00a0You have to be careful. \u00a0\u00a0Moreover, this leather armor is useless if you take a hit from a monster with a level difference of 3. \u00a0Otherwise, it can survive 20 cuts from the monsters before it becomes useless.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. \u00a0I\u2019ll be careful.!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe had given a pretty detailed instruction, yet she readily nodded her head. \u00a0Of course, there was no way she was able to remember all the details. \u00a0However, she simplified it in her head as \u2018I have to avoid being hit, and I have to kill them with the least number of swings as possible!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh? \u00a0Aren\u2019t there any weapons here that Artpe can use?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere is no god in this world that would think a magician would come into a beginner's Dungeon like this one.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe used Mana so naturally that it was easy to forget that there were very few number of magicians in the human world. \u00a0First, one had to be born with the constitution for magic. \u00a0Secondly, one had to be smart. \u00a0Thirdly, one needed an environment where there\u2019s a specialized school, who helped a young magician in dealing with Mana. \u00a0A very small number of people possessed all three requirements.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cArtpe is really really amazing\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI know. \u00a0I know.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the box, there were two daggers, three emergency potions and a little bit of ration. \u00a0Artpe put the potions and ration into a bag. \u00a0Then he equipped the daggers on his waist.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cArtpe knows how to use daggers?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI know how to throw them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe had an exceptional talent of being able to find hidden stuff. \u00a0He was also very talented at hitting targets with whatever he threw. \u00a0In the past, he had grown up in the Demon world with nothing to his name. \u00a0He didn\u2019t have the money to buy proper weapons or magic scrolls.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Before he caught the eyes of the Demon King, he had to manipulate Mana directly or he had to infuse Mana into objects to fight. \u00a0He had used these tactics to defeat threats to himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had already mentioned this before, but his tactics didn\u2019t work well against monsters in the Demon world. \u00a0This was why Artpe\u2019s childhood had been very difficult. \u00a0Even now his eyes teared up just from thinking about that period in his life.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe only thing left now\u2026. \u00a0All weapons differ in weight and balance. \u00a0If you swing the sword thinking it is the same as the wooden branch you swung yesterday, you might be killed before you can say \u2018ah\u2019. \u00a0You should swing it about couple times to get a feel for it\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe was going through his \u2018Fifty reasons why beginner adventurers die\u2019 speech. \u00a0He talked about information that was so obvious that people overlooked it. \u00a0At that moment, Maetel swung the sword through the air, and she let out a bright smile as she let out a shout.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMmm, mmm. \u00a0This will do! \u00a0Weapons with edges are very scary!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Maetel]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Level : 2]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Swordsmanship Lv3]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, yes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had been trying to give advice to a hero. \u00a0It was basically akin to a little kid trying to lecture a court magician after reading a single tome of magic. \u00a0After Artpe had this epiphany, he stepped forward. \u00a0The hero grabbed him in surprise.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou said there are monsters here!?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere should be none in front of us. \u00a0I\u2019ll be able to perceive everything.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Normal monsters appeared in the beginner\u2019s Dungeon, and the monsters couldn\u2019t avoid his detection when he used the Mana threads. \u00a0He was about to take another step with a leisurely smile on his face. \u00a0However, he took a step backwards as his expression stiffened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c....I guess not.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the first room of the Dungeon, an Elite Monster was waiting near the exit. \u00a0The Elite Monster was positioned perfectly. \u00a0It was poised to take off the head of the adventurer trying to exit the first room. \u00a0If Artpe didn\u2019t have his Read All Creation ability, he would have suffered the same fate as a regular adventurer!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy\u2019s there a monster of that caliber inside the 1st room on the 1st floor of a beginner\u2019s Dungeon!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere are strong monsters in there?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere's a level 10 Elite Zombie inside. \u00a0It possesses a Stealth ability, and the Critical Hit Skill. \u00a0It is the ideal monster to kill low level adventurers.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLevel 10?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was seven levels highers than the goblins they faced yesterday. \u00a0However, the concept of levels was foreign to Maetel. \u00a0She didn\u2019t have a point of reference for levels, so she had no idea how much stronger the monster was than her. \u00a0She tilted her head in puzzlement.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is hard to feel the difference at the low levels, but the difference in levels represents the absolute power gap. Normally, one shouldn\u2019t attack an opponent if there is a level gap of 5 levels.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen we should run away immediately!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere was a king, who thought similarly. \u00a0That bastard waged a war, but he failed spectacularly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWho is it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Demon world\u2019s greatest chef.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Heroes always developed, while ignoring the level gap. \u00a0This would be true this time around. \u00a0\u00a0Still, the Elite monster be too hard for a level 2. \u00a0The hill was too steep, so Artpe formulated a plan to decrease the gradient.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFirst, we have to kill all the monsters inside the room to increase our level. \u00a0If we consider your Stats, even a single level increase will allow you to pierce through the Elite Monster\u2019s defense.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat do I do after that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you walk forward as if nothing is wrong, the Elite Zombie will try to attack you. \u00a0At that moment, I\u2019ll attack to create an opportunity for you. \u00a0You\u2019ll attack afterwards for good measure, and you\u2019ll retreat. \u00a0Your attack won\u2019t be too effective, but I\u2019ll follow it up with an additional attack. \u00a0Don\u2019t worry too much about it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right! \u00a0What do I do afterwards?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAfterwards, you retreat and return to this entrance.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c....huh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJust be familiar with the plan I explained right now. \u00a0All right?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes!..... \u00a0Yes?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Matel didn\u2019t see the need to retreat mid fight, so she still had questions about the plan. \u00a0However, Artpe didn\u2019t give any further explanations. \u00a0Maetel tilted her head in puzzlement as she entered the Dungeon\u2019s first room with Artpe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2026 Wa\u2026 \u00a0Wa\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHumans\u2026. \u00a0Killed me\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDaughter's face\u2026.. \u00a0Want to see\u2026...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a pretty large room and there were a total of six zombies there! \u00a0Unlike the Elite Zombie, these zombies were around level 5. \u00a0When they entered the room, the zombies became aware of them. \u00a0They slowly got up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The zombies were letting out a rotting stench, and their nails were poisonous. \u00a0They were a very annoying opponent to face, but they were easy to kill. \u00a0The zombies were slow. \u00a0It was the ideal candidate for a beginner hero to face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat shall we do, Artpe? \u00a0He wants to see his daughter\u2019s face\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Their enemies were getting up slowly, and this was the ideal time to attack them. \u00a0However, Maetel wasn\u2019t moving at all! \u00a0Tears gathered in her eyes when she heard their words. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had expected her to snap under the pressure. \u00a0He had expected her to get angry. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe nodded his head as if he understood her feelings. \u00a0He spoke to her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOccasionally, there are some adventurers, who hesitate from attacking, when they hear the words spoken by the zombies.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat\u2019s right! \u00a0How can we attack such pitiful people! \u00a0We can\u2019t kill them twice!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHowever, there\u2019s something unusual here to be discovered.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe turned to look at Maetel with sharp eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf we wait a little bit longer, all the zombies will speak in a uniform pattern. \u00a0This fact can be observed.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMy daughter's\u2026.\u00b7 I want to see\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, just like that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWow. \u00a0I think that zombie also has a daughter.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere is more to it than that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel and Artpe had responded to their words, and the zombies felt their advance slow. \u00a0Several zombie hesitated before they started talking about the same subject!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDaughter\u2026.

lashed out towards the nearest zombie. \u00a0She severed its legs.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The strike was so strong and sharp that Artpe wanted to question if she really was a level 2! \u00a0It was as if the thread holding up the zombie had been severed. \u00a0It fell to the floor as it writhed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Maetel]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Level :

</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe let out a gasp as he took a step backwards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a towering rage within Maetel\u2019s eyes!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLying is bad!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDaughter\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStop lying!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDaughhhhhhhter!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The hero\u2019s fight was incredible. \u00a0No one had taught her this tactic, yet she severed the legs of zombies slowly coming towards her. \u00a0The zombies were all writhing on the ground!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The hero yelled with fire raging in her eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll never believe a monster\u2019s words from now on!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, that\u2019s the stance to take!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An ex-</span><span style=\"\">Four Heavenly King had succeeded in making the hero abandon her good character!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGoo-wuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the zombies had fallen to the floor, but they continued moving by dragging their bodies forward. \u00a0Their speed of advance was incredibly slow. \u00a0Maetel approached the closest zombie, and she cut off the head of the zombie. \u00a0She went down the line. \u00a0After she cut three heads, she turned around to look at Artpe as if she had just remembered something she had forgotten.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf I kill them all, I\u2019m the only one that\u2019ll grow. \u00a0Artpe has to increase his level!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo, you can kill the rest. \u00a0You are the one fighting from the front. \u00a0You are more important than me right now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Artpe said his words, Maetel unhesitatingly finished off the zombies. \u00a0It seemed she was still enraged by the fact that the zombies had lied to her. \u00a0Of course, even in her angered state, she was careful in preserving the sword\u2019s durability. \u00a0Her actions were praiseworthy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When she killed the six zombies, Artpe stepped forward to tap on the zombies.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet\u2019s loot first\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo matter how many times I see it, it is fascinating.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the loot that came out from the lousy zombies weren\u2019t much better than what the goblins had dropped. \u00a0The only thing that dropped with greater probability was their long nails, which was seeped with poison. \u00a0It was a very good weapon for the current Artpe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere are three poisoned nails and five copper coins. \u00a0That should be it. \u00a0Now you should walk\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe was instructing Maetel on what to do next, but he shut his mouth. \u00a0He had naturally activated his Read All Creation, and he had shut his mouth when he saw the information in front of him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Maetel]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Level - 4]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel tilted her head in puzzlement. \u00a0However, Artpe let out a bitter laugh as he shook his head from side to side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The six zombies were level 5 monsters, but this didn\u2019t mean her level should have grown from level 2 to 4 in one sitting. \u00a0However, this was normal for her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Heroes are an abnormality. \u00a0This was especially true for this one in particular if her Innate ability was taken into account\u2026 \u00a0I\u2019m pretty sure that this iteration of the hero will awaken to the same ability.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A spike of jealousy towards the hero was felt by him, but it disappeared quickly. \u00a0This hero was on his side now. \u00a0He spoke once again to the pure and simple girl, who was looking at him with worried eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJust walk forward.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel didn\u2019t hesitate. \u00a0She walked forward. \u00a0When she reached the exit, the hidden Elite Zombie appeared, and it tried to bite her neck. \u00a0Artpe threw a Mana-infused dagger. \u00a0The Elite Zombie stiffened!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGoo-wuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEh-eet!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Its Stealth ability was down, so Maetel was able to see the bastard. \u00a0She unhesitatingly swung her sword towards its leg! \u00a0Of course, this zombie wasn\u2019t called Elite for nothing. \u00a0There was no way its leg would be cut off with a single blow like the other zombies\u2026..</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGoo-wuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt fell off!?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m really angry right now!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKee-ahhhhhh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The next attack severed both legs, and the Elite Zombie fell to the floor! \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A level 10 Elite monster usually needed a 3 member party of similar level to take it down. \u00a0Maetel had been able to neutralize it with just three hits.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo we have to return to the entrance now, Artpe?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel took two steps away from the Elite Zombie. \u00a0She gallantly yelled towards Artpe. \u00a0Artpe looked at the fierce girl. \u00a0He scratched his head as he gave a reply.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo, you can just kill it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI said you can just kill it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The hero was much stronger than he had estimated, so his plan had went up in smoke. Artpe tilted his head, and he watched the girl\u2019s sword find the Elite Zombie\u2019s weak spot in an instant. \u00a0As he watched her repeatedly bring down the sword\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He just decided to laugh it off.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

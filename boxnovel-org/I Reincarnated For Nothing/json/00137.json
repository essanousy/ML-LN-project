background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">When he witnessed this sight, Artpe nodded his head as he put on a satisfied expression on his face. \u00a0Sienna was standing next to him. \u00a0Her eyes had turned round as she mumbled her words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Artpe\u2019s party was acting in an extremely leisurely manner. \u00a0The warriors were flustered by this sight. \u00a0Until a moment ago, they had been fighting for their lives. \u00a0These people had shown up from nowhere, and they had killed several hundred to several thousand of their enemies! \u00a0Their enemies were dying without being able to put up much of a resistance!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">First, Artpe was going to cut off the idea that his party was the enemy. \u00a0Artpe pointed towards the black fog that was zipping across the square.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cI\u2019m her owner. \u00a0Moreover, I\u2019m human.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was unexpected, but the Dwarves weren\u2019t using the common language of the continent. \u00a0They were using an ancient language. \u00a0However, Artpe was fluent in most languages, so it wasn\u2019t too hard to reply in the same tongue as the Dwarves.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It didn\u2019t matter if the Dwarven warriors were in a state of confusion. \u00a0Roa enthusiastically continued to satiate her appetite. \u00a0 It didn\u2019t take too long for the Shadows to be eradicated from the square. \u00a0There wasn\u2019t a single one of them left.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The short Dwarven warriors kept hanging back as they bunched together. \u00a0The sight was a bit adorable, but that wasn\u2019t important right now. \u00a0Roa looked across the square to the location where the Shadows had exited. \u00a0Roa turned backed into the form of a black cat as she stared at the deep black hole. \u00a0She nodded her head as she returned to Artpe\u2019s arms.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">[Nyaa nyaa nyaa, nyaa-nyaa-ah.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Artpe let out a bitter laugh when he heard Roa\u2019s explanation. \u00a0He never expected such a horrible \u2018Dungeon\u2019 to exist below the surface of the world.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Just the presence of the hole dyed its surrounding with Demonic energy. \u00a0It was also a Dungeon that periodically spat out evil spirits from within. \u00a0It was no wonder the Dwarves were trapped underground. \u00a0It was understandable as to why they no longer appeared above ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cA...a cat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Dwarven warriors quieted down. \u00a0Artpe had gained the upper hand by merely having Roa in his arms. \u00a0He smirked as he took a step forward. \u00a0The Dwarves flinched, and every one of them clenched their weapons harder.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Artpe spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was the proper way to handle a first meeting with a different race! \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Dwarves thought they were going to fight a battle that would determine the fate of the entire race. \u00a0They had been trembling at that thought. \u00a0When they heard Artpe\u2019s random question, they tilted their head in confusion. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It seemed the Dwarves had come to a conclusion. \u00a0Several Dwarven warriors quickly turned around, and they quickly ran into a tunnel. \u00a0On one end of this enormous square, there was the hole where the evil spirits had crawled out from. \u00a0On the other side, there was a tunnel that presumably led to the territory of the Dwarves. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u2018As expected of the Dwarves...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Artpe had been surprised when he saw the existence of the long tunnel. \u00a0Aside from the Dwarves from the legends, it was impossible to excavate and maintain structures so deep within the earth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">When one of the Dwarves spoke to him in a courteous manner, Artpe let out a bitter laugh as he spoke. \u00a0Artpe and his party members had show up from nowhere, and they had slaughtered several thousand monsters. \u00a0They had kill them, because the monsters possessed Demonic energy. \u00a0The Dwarves were like the Elves. \u00a0They were of another race. \u00a0 Artpe wasn\u2019t going to attack them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

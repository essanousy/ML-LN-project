background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In truth, it was a desperate situation, yet Artpe continued to make fun of his enemy. \u00a0He was taking his time. \u00a0However, as he kept attacking Jeriet\u2019s mind with truths, he was trying very hard to comprehend what was going on right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">First, he knew that Silpennon and Aria had been exploring the last region left in the Zero Class. \u00a0They were unlucky, and they were found out by Jeriet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Jeriet realized that it would be impossible to quietly dispose of Silpennon and Aria. \u00a0Moreover, he realized that Aria possesed an ability that would make her a great sacrifice for the magic circle. \u00a0This was why he had revealed his true nature by activating the magic circle. \u00a0Silpennon had been smart, and he was able to use the Image Transmission artifact to broadcast everything above Lihazeta.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Silpennon also attacked the pope in an attempt to save Aria, but his ability was sorely lacking to be able to fight one of the four Heavenly King. \u00a0He had suffered grievous wounds, and Aria was in danger of dying after being used as a sacrifice for the magic circle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was the information he had discerned before he entered this place. \u00a0This was why he couldn\u2019t guarantee the lives of Silpennon and Aria before he got here. \u00a0When he entered the underground Plaza, he had found Aria placed in the center of the magic circle as a sacrifice, and she was assimilating with the magic circle\u2019s Mana. \u00a0She was doing an excellent job fusing with the magic circle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even if Aria\u2019s Innate ability was amazing, Artpe was having a hard time accepting what was going on. \u00a0If she was able to assimilate with anything or anyone she wanted, she would have already reached the realm of the gods. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The magic circle was completed through the countless years. \u00a0A magic contract was created, and only a very limited number of people was able to use the magic circle. \u00a0Despite this fact, Aria was assimilating with the magic circle, so of course, Artpe was shocked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If she was able to do this, he was sure Aria was\u2026..</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was already a situation where he couldn\u2019t use the magic circle according to his will. \u00a0This was why he gave up on controlling the magic circle. \u00a0He took off the pope\u2019s outer shell, and he regained his original form of a Demon!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

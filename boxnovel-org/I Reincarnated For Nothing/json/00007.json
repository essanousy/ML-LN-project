\u00a0In his past life, if the Demon King had seceded his seat to Artpe, he wondered if he would have been able to bring about a victory for the Demon world against the human world. \u00a0This was how great his brainwashing was!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy is Artpe so good at throwing weapons?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou were able to freely control and wield a blunt weapon when you picked it up. \u00a0My skills aren\u2019t as great as yours.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Maetel]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Level : 29]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Blunt Weapon Lv4]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe snorted at Maetel\u2019s words as he looted the fallen Skeletons. \u00a0Maetel was now used to the concept of looting, so she helped Artpe. \u00a0A silver coin had dropped from one of the monsters. \u00a0It felt as if it was eons ago(it had been around 4 days) when they had been surprised by the appearance of silver coins. \u00a0Now the two of them picked it up without being surprised by its presence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt feels almost magical when my level increases. \u00a0I know I am the same person, yet I am well aware that that I can do much more now! \u00a0Something I would consider to be miraculous in the past is now part of my daily life. \u00a0Things that I considered to be impossible are within my reach. \u00a0This really is quite enjoyable.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNormally, that sensation can be barely achieved only after undergoing countless tribulation. \u00a0Please keep that in mind.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Artpe was going through the same process as her, but Artpe had experienced reaching level 350 in his past life. \u00a0He was able to keep everything in perspective.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel\u2019s talent wasn\u2019t simply better than others, because she had superior strength and status. \u00a0It had to do with her constitution and level. \u00a0Moreover, she possessed an instinct that allowed her to adapt in battle situations. \u00a0She had the potential to bring out the best result from within herself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCurrently, we are on par with most mercenaries. \u00a0I\u2019m talking about career mercenaries, who\u2019ve been to war.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat are you saying, Artpe?

\u00a0After Artpe assessed the situation, he once again sent several dozen threads into his surrounding. \u00a0At the same time, he grabbed Maetel\u2019s hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cRun! \u00a0Right now!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo matter who the enemy is, we should try fighting it first....\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is completely different from the Elite Zombie we met earlier! \u00a0Run!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two started running in a hurry. \u00a0They had doubled back, but a Skeleton was approaching them at overwhelming speed. \u00a0Each room of the Dungeon was separated by a steel door, and the Skeleton was simply busting through them as it gathered the other monsters under its command. \u00a0It was the worst type of Elite monster! \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you think I\u2019ll go down\u2026.so easily!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His Mana Threads had been severed, but he had sent out his Mana Threads once again. \u00a0This \u00a0move wasn\u2019t a waste of Mana. \u00a0Artpe had used the power of his Read All Creation ability, \u00a0and he used it to activate all the traps with his Mana Threads. \u00a0The traps got in the way of the Skeletons.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Goo-wuhhhhhhhh!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeletons were being destroyed at various locations. \u00a0Even the Elite Skeleton leading the horde was being damaged. \u00a0Still, the Elite Skeleton hadn\u2019t slowed down much. \u00a0Instead, it started using the corpses of dead Skeletons to shield itself from the traps.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTsk\u2026..!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This Dungeon had been annoying in the fact that it had more traps than monsters. \u00a0However, none of the traps would be able to cause critical damage to the Elite Skeleton. \u00a0\u00a0Artpe mainly focused on killing the Skeletons trailing behind the Elite Skeleton with the traps. \u00a0Artpe and Maetel kept retreating.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhere are we running to, Artpe?!?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe are going to the Dungeon entrance.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Dungeon entrance?

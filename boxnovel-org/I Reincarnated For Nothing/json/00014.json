It was also the moment in their lives where Artpe and Maetel had to focus the most.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe was in a precarious situation where his Mana was about to bottom out, so he continued to keep a low profile. \u00a0In the end, Maetel\u2019s Swordsmanship had reached level 9\u2026..</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeletons, who were exhausted from battle, tried a new tactic where they purposefully tried to die through Maetel\u2019s attacks. \u00a0However, Artpe intercepted them by throwing his shield into their abdomen. \u00a0They were put out of the battle by the hard hits, and the only thing these Skeletons could do was roll around the floor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Finally, Artpe felt himself reach his limit in terms of his body and Mana.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-ooh. \u00a0Koo-hoo-ooh\u2026.!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is all done, Artpe!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGgoo-oohk. \u00a0All right.!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe was moments away from losing his consciousness. \u00a0He was about to fall to the floor. \u00a0However, a voice of an angel could be heard through Artpe\u2019s ears. \u00a0Artpe gritted his teeth as he fought to stay up. \u00a0He checked the state of the Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was as if hell had manifested on this floor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Goo-gahk, gah-gah-gahk\u2026...]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[There is no way\u2026. \u00a0\u00a0I\u2019ll

\u00a0The number of Skeletons capable of continuing the battle was also zero. \u00a0The floor was a mess. \u00a0It was hard to tell if the bones were ribs or spines. \u00a0They were all just rolling around the floor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two heroes had taken down over 400 Skeletons, and it drove home the absurdity of the situation faced by the party of two.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you ok, Artpe\u2026.?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m still alive but, you\u2026. \u00a0\u00a0Are you able to cancel your Berserk state?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u00b7\u2026...yes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was as she said. \u00a0Her emotions started to calm after speaking those words. \u00a0The red haze that had covered her entire body dissipated, and her Mana calmed. \u00a0Artpe let out a bitter laugh at the sight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Rage had swept over her, and her rage had paralyzed a portion of her rationality. \u00a0He had been a little bit worried that she wouldn\u2019t have been able to cancel her Berserk state. \u00a0It might have led to an accident occurring\u2026. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed his fears had been baseless.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Still, a wrong was a wrong even if the two of them survived the battle unharmed. \u00a0First, he ended the Mana link with her. \u00a0He narrowed his eyes as he spoke in a stern voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWere you aware that you had learned a dangerous skill?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. \u00a0However, if I hadn\u2019t maintained it, I thought Artpe would die\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStill, if you had died, all of this would have been for naught. \u00a0If I survived while you died in this place, do you think I would have been happy?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh-oooh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When she heard Artpe\u2019s cold voice, Maetel\u2019s cheeks turned red, and she lowered her head. \u00a0When he saw this sight, he finally took his ire down a peg.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was easy to forget, but she was a beginner hero. \u00a0She had picked up the sword less than a week ago. \u00a0She was only a 12 year old girl. \u00a0Yet she had somehow kept a hold on her rationality as she maintained her Berserk skill. \u00a0In truth, she deserved praise.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe danger of using that skill is so high, because it is a skill that deals with an emotion. \u00a0If you think of the skill as your absolute ally, it\u2019ll come back as a blade that will plunge itself into your heart. \u00a0I just want you to remember this fact. \u00a0\u00a0All right?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cY...yes. \u00a0I\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c....all right. \u00a0Let\u2019s finish this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, he wanted to sit her down and give her a lecture. \u00a0However, he worried his words would create an artificial ceiling for her talent, so he decided to leave it be.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoohp.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He violently pulled on the threads connected to the shield. \u00a0The enormous shield fell from the air to destroy the skulls of the nearest Skeletons. \u00a0All the Skeletons on the floor had already been inflicted with several layers of the shield\u2019s curse, so they couldn\u2019t put up any fight against the shield. \u00a0\u00a0They were broken into pieces.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[D...dead.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Our comrades were completely annihilated\u2026..]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Our power is getting stronger, but\u2026.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMay I destroy all of them, Artpe?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, you can destroy all of them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe let out a kind laugh as he raised his hand again. \u00a0The shield floated into the air as it followed his hand gesture. \u00a0It stood on its edge, and it started to rotate in a violent manner. \u00a0Maetel also squeezed out the remaining energy left in her tired body as she swung her bastard sword.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Koo-ahk!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Koo-gah-gahk!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Regret\u2026\u2026..]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Every time one Skeleton was killed the other Skeletons felt a surge of energy within their bodies. \u00a0However, the only thing they could do with the abundance of energy was to rattle around the floor. \u00a0Of course, as more Skeletons died, the defense of the remaining Skeletons also increased. \u00a0The Skeletons couldn\u2019t even jump towards the two heroes to attack them, so the improvements being wrought on the Skeletons were meaningless.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cA single blow isn't enough to kill them. \u00a0Eh-eet! \u00a0Eh-eet!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere is a better way to do this, Maetel. \u00a0You shouldn\u2019t unnecessarily harm you weapon\u2019s durability.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe extended his Mana Threads, and he took control of the Skeletons, who couldn\u2019t put up much of a fight. \u00a0He started bashing the skulls of Skeletons against each other. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was able to smash and eliminate the Skeletons in an effective manner!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Koo-ahhhhh!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You\u2026 \u00a0You wicked bastards\u2026..!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He used the hardened skulls against each other! \u00a0Although his past occupation was being one of the Four Heavenly Kings, he was displaying a level of ruthlessness that might exceed the Demon King!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cArtpe is amazing! \u00a0This really is easier than breaking them with my sword!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, it really is\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The current hero was already different person now. \u00a0In her previous incarnation, Maetel had been a pure and innocent woman. \u00a0He had seen her shed tears when one of the Four Heavenly King had died. \u00a0She had been a virtuous woman. \u00a0Now she was a girl, who was smashing Skeletons against each other!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe realized how important early education was as he swung the skull. \u00a0If someone saw the two, they wouldn\u2019t think they were heroes. \u00a0They looked like great candidates to become the next Demon King.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Finally, the moment of truth arrived.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThese are the last ones, Artpe.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLook at how hard their skulls are. \u00a0It is hard to call them as being Skeletons anymore. \u00a0They are almost on the same rank as a Dullahan.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[We want you to give us an honorable death\u2026.!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The power of several hundred Skeletons were split between the two remaining Skeletons. \u00a0The two skulls were the product of this process. \u00a0They were so heavy and hard that one wondered if they could be used as weapons. \u00a0Artpe was weak in strength, so he couldn\u2019t even lift the skulls. \u00a0Maetel, who easily swung the bastard sword, was barely able to lift them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As an experiment, she threw the skulls against the wall. \u00a0The blameless wall cracked instead of the skulls. \u00a0Artpe tilted his head in puzzlement when he saw this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI think it is comparable to a level 100\u2026..?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo is it better to catch 400 level 50 Skeletons or one level 100 Skeleton? \u00a0Which gives better EXP?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOf course, the former gives an overwhelmingly more EXP. \u00a0Anyways, this magic wasn\u2019t meant to give its opponents EXP in such a manner.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In terms of EXP, Artpe and Maetel was suffering a very huge loss through this venture.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If they had killed 400 normal level 50 Skeletons, they would have been strengthened by a ridiculous amount. \u00a0However, if one looked at the outcome of this battle, it had been equivalent to killing a level 10 Skeleton.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHowever, the world isn\u2019t only about EXP.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When one defeated an enemy that was significantly higher in level, one\u2019s Achievement was recorded. \u00a0It was something that followed one throughout one\u2019s lifetime.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one defeated a level 70 enemy at level 50, the Achievement remained throughout one\u2019s lifetime. \u00a0It had the effect of aiding the one, who had acquired the Achievement. \u00a0\u00a0Even if one faced an enemy of higher level at a later date, the effects of the Achievement won\u2019t weaken or disappear. \u00a0It helped one fight the higher level enemy head-on. \u00a0It even had an influence on the acquisition of skills, and the reward items that one acquired from battling monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOn top of it all, you can\u2019t ignore the skill growth that occurs when you apply the finishing blow. \u00a0Normally, a skill grows the more you use it. \u00a0The other method to grow your skill is to kill an enemy using the skill. \u00a0If you acquired the skill while fighting an enemy, the successful killing of the enemy allows the skill to grow once more.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWow. \u00a0Amazing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, there was no adjustment if one wasn\u2019t successful in killing the enemy. \u00a0This was also true for running away or canceling the battle. \u00a0The reason why this happened was unknown.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Someday, he\u2019ll ask the question to the god, who had made this world. \u00a0He\u2019ll seize the bastard by the collar.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe technical term for this phenomena is called Rumination.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cArtpe knows everything!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI don\u2019t know everything. \u00a0I know what I know.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While Maetel was asking questions and receiving answers from Artpe, she was bashing the two skulls against each other. \u00a0Cracks were forming on the skulls. \u00a0Her repetitive action was so mechanical that he felt goose bumps all over his body. \u00a0Artpe took a small step backwards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I won\u2019t forgive you. \u00a0I will revive someday, and I will raise my sword in revenge against you guys!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. \u00a0Next Undead, please.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-ooh\u2026.. This is the last one!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel let out a shout as she brought one skull against the other. \u00a0At that moment, she gathered the small amount of Mana left inside her body into her arms. \u00a0This single strike was more powerful than any of her previous blows. \u00a0It cleanly pulverized both skulls. \u00a0At the same time, it wouldn\u2019t have surprised Artpe if she gained the Bash skill through this action.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anyways, this was how all the monsters on the 6th floor were eradicated. \u00a0\u00a0The Mana and the Record had been gathered into a single bundle. \u00a0It was finally released from the monsters, and it was given to the challengers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh-ooh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel let out a short moan. Artpe had somewhat expected this so he kept his mouth shut, but it wasn\u2019t as if he was fine. \u00a0It felt as if all their internal organs had been dislodged. \u00a0They felt nausea sweep over them as if their internal organs were spinning around like a tornado.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cArtpe\u2026. \u00a0This is....\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEndure it\u2026. \u00a0It is the level up.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is it?

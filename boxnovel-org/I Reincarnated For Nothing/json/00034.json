\u00a0He didn\u2019t even need to ask that question. \u00a0The general population would fall into chaos, so the Demon King\u2019s army would have achieved its goal. \u00a0Anything that happened afterwards was a bonus.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat means\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe looked at Aena, and he thought how unlikely all of this was. \u00a0If they hadn\u2019t come to this town\u2026 \u00a0No, if he hadn\u2019t frightened away the soldiers, it would have been Aena\u2019s turn to be taken away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There weren\u2019t any cursed children left in the town besides Aena. \u00a0If she wasn\u2019t here, he wouldn\u2019t have been so aggressive in jumping into this matter. \u00a0He wouldn\u2019t have budged no matter what anyone would have said to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Basically, a small flame he had created at a whim had turned into this Quest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c....so this is what it like to be a hero.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe shut his eyes as he mumbled to himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he researched the progress of the hero in the past, he had wondered why trouble seemed to follow the hero. \u00a0Now that he was the person directly involved in the matter, everything was falling into place. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had no more excuses. \u00a0Their actions forged the future. \u00a0It sounded as if he was using circular reasoning\u2026. \u00a0Ah, it couldn\u2019t be. \u00a0He probably wasn\u2019t.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, it became noisy outside. \u00a0The townspeople had brought their \u2018entire fortune\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cM...magician-nim! \u00a0We brought it all! \u00a0This really is all our fortune!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt really is tough to make a living these days, so this is all we have. \u00a0We are telling you the truth\u2026.!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWill you really find my child just from receiving this?

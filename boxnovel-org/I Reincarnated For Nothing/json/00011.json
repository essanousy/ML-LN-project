\u00a0Mana potion? \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unfortunately, this Dungeon didn\u2019t drop expensive potions that would allow her to recover her Mana.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What about Mana recovery herb? \u00a0Of course, there were rare cases where Mana herb grew in the corners of a Dungeon. \u00a0However, this Dungeon hadn\u2019t had any.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This meant that he had to consider his last option. \u00a0It was Mana transfer. \u00a0Artpe was overflowing with Mana.(He possessed Magical talent that would never be seen again in the human race. \u00a0His body was ridiculous.) \u00a0He just had to find a way to transfer it to Maetel.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This would allow Maetel to maintain her buff, and he wouldn\u2019t have to waste Mana on a spell like Hyper Rubbing. \u00a0Of course, if this was easily done, he would have done it already.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018There are magic that allows one to transfer Mana to others, but I haven\u2019t learned those spells yet.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, he would have to directly control his Mana to be able to inject it into Maetel. \u00a0At this rate, Artpe might develop a new Mana Control Class never before seen in history. \u00a0As he mulled over the new questions about his own identity, he grabbed a Mana Thread with his free hand. \u00a0His other hand was holding onto the leather strap of the shield.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMaetel! \u00a0I want you to decrease your movement radius!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right! \u00a0I shagged two!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel shouted with great vigor. \u00a0She swung her bastard sword as it impacted three Skeletons. \u00a0Their bodies were severely damaged. \u00a0It made one think that they would be better off dead. \u00a0In a short amount of time, she had quickly gotten used to using the bastard sword. \u00a0This truth was self evident.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe shot out his Mana Thread towards Maetel, and it gently touched her shoulder. \u00a0Artpe had never tried Mana transfer before, so he focused his mind as he tried to inject his Mana into her. \u00a0Sure enough, the Mana wasn\u2019t easily absorbed by Maetel. \u00a0It dissipated in the middle of the process.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had delivered Mana to Maetel, but it hadn\u2019t bolstered her Mana reserve. \u00a0His magical energy had basically gave her a shoulder massage!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI shagged three again! \u00a0Eh-hee hee. \u00a0You are tickling me, Artpe.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStop liking it so much. \u00a0You are annoying me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe continuously threw and received his shield with one hand. (He didn\u2019t know the cause behind it, but once the shield returned, it was sent out at a higher speed and strength than the previous throw. \u00a0He was coming close to taking down as many enemies as Maetel.) \u00a0He used his other hand to continuously send the Mana Thread towards Maetel.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Fail, fail and fail.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If things progressed as is, he wouldn\u2019t become more proficient at Mana transfer. \u00a0He would become more proficient at giving Maetel a massage!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cArtpe is really amazing!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe fact that your heart is always in the right place makes this much more annoying!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He couldn\u2019t waste his Mana like this. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Would it be more advantageous to take down the Skeletons using Hyper Rubbing?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe was having such thoughts as he turned his head. \u00a0The number of broken Skeletons were rising. \u00a0There were almost 50 of them. \u00a0It was at this moment when he realized something. \u00a0The more shocking news was that over 20 Skeletons had appeared once again at the end of the hall!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat the heck!

\u00a0\u00a0A good amount of red light was starting to emanate in vaporous form from her body. \u00a0It was evidence that the skill was consuming her stamina instead of her magical energy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are going to kill yourself, Maetel!

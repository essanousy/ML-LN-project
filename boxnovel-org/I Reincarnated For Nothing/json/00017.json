That kind of sweet words will only work against the Four Heavenly Kings of the Demon king\u2019s army.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why such words worked on him. \u00a0It was a direct hit. \u00a0Artpe let out a fake cough as he tried to hide the fullness he felt within his heart.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t know what would appear in front of them. \u00a0It was something that couldn\u2019t be confirmed unless one saw it with one\u2019s eyes. \u00a0He also knew that priority of this Dungeon had changed when he found out how the Dungeon was structured.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In other words, they were too far down the road to back off now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018In my past life, the hero wasted five years of her life at the castle. \u00a0We have a lot of time to spare.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, even if Artpe had used all types of methods to focus on leveling up, it was unclear as to whether he would have been able to achieve a better result than this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They would have missed out on fighting a horde of Skeletons linked by a rare magic called Record Link. \u00a0They would have missed out on the precious EXP, and the artifacts they received as reward. \u00a0They wouldn\u2019t have been amass this much fortune. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The factor that tipped the scale was the fact that Artpe and Maetel was able to develop so many high quality Skills here. \u00a0It was crazy. \u00a0If they hadn\u2019t drawn this Dungeon as their first starting place, he wondered if they would have been able to develop skills like Berserk and Mana Link.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if they continued to stay inside the Dungeon for five years, it wouldn\u2019t impede with their development.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Ah. \u00a0Of course, I have to get out of here and find those places as soon as possible\u2026..\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe possessed the memories of his past life, so he had several significant advantages he could acquire for himself. \u00a0He was talking about spell books of great magic, ancient ruins and the like.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While Artpe battled within the Dungeon, he created a hierarchy of which goodies he will go for first. \u00a0\u00a0He would gain enough level in the Dungeon where they would be able to travel the world without worry. \u00a0They will start traveling according to the list he had made.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why they didn\u2019t have time to hesitate or look back on what had already occurred. \u00a0It didn\u2019t matter what waited for them. \u00a0They would move forward. \u00a0This was the will of Maetel and Artpe even if their destination differed!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After they smoothly defeat the Demon King, he would have the means to be able to raise cows in the countryside. \u00a0At that time, he would be done with Maetel! \u00a0He didn\u2019t care if she wanted to become the queen of a country or a female pope of a religion she built. \u00a0She was free to do whatever she wanted!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Until that time arrived, Artpe and Maetel had to live a healthy and well-off life. \u00a0In the immediate future, they would have to pass this Dungeon without any complications.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAren\u2019t you tired, Maetel? \u00a0Shall we head down after we sleep?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m not tired, Artpe. \u00a0What about you, Artpe? \u00a0Do you want to use my lap as a pillow?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m also not tired.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTsk.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel grumbled as if she was dissatisfied with his answer. \u00a0Artpe led Maetel down to the Dungeon\u2019s 35th floor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, a powerful vibration shook the Dungeon. \u00a0Accompanying the tremor, a wet and moldy voice could be heard in their ears.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[This test has been maintained for a very long time.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018That is a pretty ominous introduction!?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was as if a legendary figure was about to step forward from the darkness if they took a step forward. \u00a0It was a line given by a being, who would drop the adventurers into hell!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey, let\u2019s head back for a moment.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Denied.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he heard the introductory line emanating from the darkness, Artpe immediately knew something was wrong. \u00a0He quickly ordered a retreat as soon as they stepped onto this floor. \u00a0However, the way back to the 34th floor was blocked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You bastards are only allowed to go forward.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou talk a pretty good game\u2026 \u00a0Ooh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe was clicking his tongue as he tried to use his Mana. \u00a0However, the torches mounted on the wall started to light up in order starting from the nearest torches. \u00a0The light from the fire revealed the layout of the 35th floor. \u00a0Artpe groaned when he saw them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c....crazy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLook at them, Artpe\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were in a really large square, and there were a very, very ,very ,very ,very ,very large number of armored knights filling the place. \u00a0The armored knights boasted a much more domineering spirit compared to the Ghouls. \u00a0\u00a0It was obvious that Undeads were within the armor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[We\u2019ve been waiting for you, destroyer of rules.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Insolent brat. \u00a0\u00a0You are the honey tongued brat that defies logic.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Your judgement is close at hand.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even in death, these beings hadn\u2019t forgotten the will and techniques carved into their bodies. \u00a0They were knights, who had a sense of self. \u00a0They were Death Knights. \u00a0All of them were powerful, and they were all over level 150. \u00a0There were 500 of them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If a normal level 120 party was to fight this group, the possibility of them winning was uncertain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The one standing in the lead raised its bastard sword towards Artpe as its helmet rattled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You have caused dishonor to all of us. \u00a0You have corrupted the pure hero by spitting on our intent. \u00a0You have looked down on our power. \u00a0Your misguided will is now encased in a powerful body, and the worst of the situation has come to pass. You made fool of fate. \u00a0You connected things that shouldn\u2019t be connected, and you severed things you shouldn\u2019t have severed.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">All the Death Knights followed the one in the lead as they pointed their swords towards Artpe. \u00a0During all of this, they hadn\u2019t shown much hostility towards Maetel. \u00a0They directed all their hate towards Artpe as if he was their mortal enemy. \u00a0It annoyed Artpe. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These bastards were quick in assessing the situation!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Still, we cannot deny the fact that you are a hero. \u00a0This is why we will give you this last chance. \u00a0If you take this last test properly, we will believe in this reality that had be turned on its head. \u00a0We will trust in the hope blooming from within the darkness that will cause change to the future. \u00a0We will go back to sleep.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo, you don\u2019t really have to believe in me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The ominous feeling was increasing as time passed. \u00a0Artpe readied the only specialty magic he possessed. \u00a0He readied himself to use Hyper Rubbing, then he grasped Maetel\u2019s shoulder. \u00a0It was signal for her to get ready for battle. \u00a0It also told her to be careful of their enemies.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Artpe.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even in such a situation, Maetel\u2019s expression was calm. \u00a0In the past year, her features had matured considerably. \u00a0She already looked like an angel, but her beautiful smile made her look like an archangel. \u00a0She gave a reassurance to Artpe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll protect Artpe. \u00a0Artpe will protect me in return?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c....yes. \u00a0I trust you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The shield on Artpe\u2019s back rose into the air. \u00a0He only had to repair the shield couple times as they descended from the 6th floor to the 35th floor. \u00a0This was why the shield hadn\u2019t been replaced with other weapons. \u00a0It was a rare artifact that gave a weak curse to whatever it hit. \u00a0If he was with the shield, there was nothing for him to fear!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[When the battle starts, he might use cheap tactics to play us off against each other.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the enemies he would face were excessively resolute in defending against mental warfare.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[This is why we will force the activation of the final test, so you can face it.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh, hey\u2026 \u00a0Wait a moment, you guys\u00b7.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe tried to speak up when he realized what they were about to do, but the Death Knights just glared at Artpe as they plunged their swords into their hearts. \u00a0Their Mana flooded forth! \u00a0The restriction of the Record Link made it impossible to attack one\u2019s comrades, but it seemed suicide was possible!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As he faced the domineering sight, Artpe yelled out in shock.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou bastards will be penalized even if you kill yourselves!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[We are already Undead!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The 499 Death Knights crumbled in place. \u00a0The oppressive energy from each of the Death Knights flowed towards the single Death Knight standing in the middle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It happened when Artpe and Maetel was struck dumb by the ridiculous sight. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I\u2019m ready, heroes.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The power of the armored knights were gathered into a single being, and \u2018It\u2019 was reborn as a horrible nightmare. \u00a0It made a declaration as it pointed its long sword towards the two heroes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The test will start.]</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

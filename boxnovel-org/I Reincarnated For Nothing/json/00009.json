\u00a0What will allow it to kill the shitty little brat?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Warrior thought hard about its situation. \u00a0After it agonized over its options, it came up with a single answer. \u00a0\u00a0It had watched the little brat do it over and over again. \u00a0The Skeleton Warrior thought it could somewhat replicate what the brat did.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, you are doing well. \u00a0You should move that arm more\u2026. \u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Die human!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cArtpe!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe had been focused on using the Hyper Rubbing spell. \u00a0The Skeleton Warrior put all its anger into its roar. \u00a0At the same time, Maetel moved to knock Artpe out of the way.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGg-oooooooooh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Koo-ahhhhhhhh! \u00a0Damn humans! \u00a0Damn humaaaaaaans!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Accompanying the explosive sound, a large sword was embedded into the stairway of the Dungeon\u2019s entrance. \u00a0It was none other than the Skeleton Warrior\u2019s bastard sword.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKoo, ah....\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMaetel?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel let out a moan. \u00a0The Skeleton Warrior had thrown the bastard sword with all its might. \u00a0The sword had grazed her back. \u00a0Her armor had been completely ripped into pieces, and to make matters worse, it left behind a wound on her back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDamn it, Maetel! \u00a0Maetel!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He never expected an enemy without the Throw skill to throw its bastard sword towards him! \u00a0He had put his complete trust in his Read All Creation ability. \u00a0His error in judgment had almost cost him his life.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had shown a carelessness that was befitting his title as the weakest of the </span><span style=\"\">Four Heavenly Kings! \u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If Maetel had been a bit late, Artpe would have lost his life.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet me see your wound. \u00a0Hurry!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. \u00a0Oohk\u2026...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe blamed his stupidity as he looked at Maetel\u2019s wound. \u00a0A well-placed wound on the back could hamper one\u2019s movement. \u00a0Fortunately, that wasn\u2019t the case. \u00a0If she leveled up couple times alongside regular rest, her body would be back to a pristine state. \u00a0It seemed Maetel was also aware of this fact, so her face wasn\u2019t clouded at all. \u00a0She had a bright smile on her face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m alright, Artpe\u2026. \u00a0I\u2019m just glad Artpe isn\u2019t hurt.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou idiot\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Artpe realized Maetel hadn\u2019t been hurt too badly, he truly felt relieved, and he also felt a weird feeling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If she died, it would deal a very big blow to his dream of living a peaceful life. \u00a0However, the feeling he had felt was caused by something else\u2026.. \u00a0\u00a0He must be mistaken. \u00a0Artpe shook such dumb thoughts away as he raised his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He saw the Skeleton Warrior in front of him. \u00a0It had gone berserk from the Rage type Buff. \u00a0Its white bones had turned completely red.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The arm holding the shield was on the ground, and the other arm had also fallen off when it couldn\u2019t withstand the shock. \u00a0The bastard raged as it threw its body forward, but there was an invisible wall blocking it. \u00a0It blocked its forward progress no matter how it tried to charge forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Gg-oooooooooh! \u00a0Gg-oooooooooh!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCan you move, Maetel?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If Maetel wasn\u2019t injured, he would have finished off the Skeleton Warrior. \u00a0However, the top priority right now was to level her up, so she could recover. \u00a0Of course, Artpe had done most of the work, so not much EXP would go to Maetel. \u00a0However, this EXP was from killing a very strong opponent. \u00a0A smaller portion of the EXP would still be enough to level her up!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-ooh, hoo-ooh\u2026.. \u00a0All right. \u00a0I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel was breathing roughly as she got up. \u00a0She was about to pull out her rusted sword, but her gaze headed backwards as she looked towards the bastard sword embedded in the stairway. She hesitated before she approached the bastard sword. \u00a0She extracted it with both hands.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was made out of heavy metal, and magical energy had been used to manufacture the sword. \u00a0It was a very heavy sword. \u00a0However, she swung it easily.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Human\u2026...]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry. \u00a0I can\u2019t beat you in a fair fight. \u00a0However, I\u2019m able to kill you now, so I will kill you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had taken the enemy\u2019s weapon, yet she had taken complete possession of the weapon from just swinging it once or twice. \u00a0Maetel glared at the Skeleton Warrior as she spoke. \u00a0It was almost as if she was chanting her words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll win and kill anyone to protect Artpe. \u00a0Because I\u2019m\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She pulled the hilt of the sword towards her chest. \u00a0She kept a firm grip as she slightly bent her knees. \u00a0She leaned her upper body forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Warrior raised its leg slightly to face her. \u00a0Maetel used the burning pain from her back as the starting signal. \u00a0She kicked off the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBecause I\u2019m! \u00a0I\u2019m the hero!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Koo-ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As she let out a short shout, the sword split the air. \u00a0\u00a0Her sword struck at the exact spot where Artpe\u2019s dagger was embedded in its skull. \u00a0The sword cut through the skull, and she broke all its ribs.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If the Skeleton Warrior was in its normal state, it could have resisted against her attack. \u00a0However, the strike was too much for the current Skeleton Warrior. \u00a0\u00a0After its body was broken by the sword, it twitched as if it wanted to fight back. \u00a0However, the Skeleton Warrior came to a complete stop.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Gooh, ah ah\u2026. \u00a0Ah, ah. \u00a0I...is...is that so?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Surprisingly, the bisected Skeleton started to say something.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The will within the unshakable blade has awoken me up from my haze\u2026..]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMmm. \u00a0What\u2026..?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[That\u2019s right, young heroes. \u00a0Those who run away and never come back are called cowards. \u00a0However, the ones that come back to win in the end are heroes. \u00a0You win by fair means or foul. \u00a0\u00a0You have carried on your conviction to protect. \u00a0With my demise, I will open the entrance that will lead to the glory of the heroes.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat the hell is the Skeleton saying\u2026..?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe was flustered as he asked the question, but the Skeleton Warrior no longer opened its mouth. \u00a0The magical energy from its body drained out as it entered Artpe and Maetel. \u00a0Their magical energy increased, and the EXP was distributed. \u00a0The battle was over.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey, wait a moment. \u00a0If you have something to say to us then you should talk more\u2026.. \u00a0Shit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe urgently stood up, and he tried to look at the Skeleton Warrior with his Read All Creation ability. \u00a0At that moment, its body eroded away. \u00a0It left behind the cracked large steel shield, Red Bone gauntlet, and several bones that refused to erode away. \u00a0These bones had too much Magical energy to immediately erode away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the truly surprising event started afterwards. \u00a0When the Skeleton Warrior was completely gone, the Dungeon started to shake in a fierce manner. After killing the Skeleton Warrior, Maetel had slowly relaxed, but now her eyes were round as she ran towards Artpe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cArtpe. \u00a0The Dungeon is\u2026..!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWait a moment. \u00a0It isn\u2019t collapsing. \u00a0There are times when a Dungeon goes through a change when one fulfills a specific condition. \u00a0So right now it\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He would just be beating a dead horse by repeating the fact that the Dungeon was hiding something. \u00a0Maybe, this Dungeon might be beyond Artpe\u2019s expectation. \u00a0Something enormous might lie inside the Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If so, what should he do? \u00a0Should they back out? \u00a0Or should they move forward, while accepting the risk? \u00a0If he hadn\u2019t seen Maetel get injured, he wouldn\u2019t have hesitated. \u00a0He would have advanced, but Artpe couldn\u2019t do that any more.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet\u2019s go, Artpe.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Maetel realized he was hesitating, so she spoke to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI want to become stronger. \u00a0If there comes a time when we have to run away, we\u2019ll run away and win later. \u00a0However, if possible, I want to win without running away.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMaetel\u2026...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat is why I want to become stronger.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was this really words spoken by a 12 year old girl? \u00a0Artpe shut his mouth from amazement, but he firmed his resolve when he saw the the unshakable light within Maetel\u2019s eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, she wasn\u2019t repeating words she had heard from someone else. \u00a0She wasn\u2019t just spouting words in a childish fit. \u00a0Her experience within the Dungeon had been short, but a lot had happened during that time. \u00a0It seemed she had found some purpose, and she wanted to put it into practice. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the change that Artpe had wanted to see within her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c.....yes, let\u2019s go. \u00a0No matter what shows up, we'll defeat it. \u00a0Let bring out everything we can gain from inside the Dungeon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Read All Creation ability wasn\u2019t perfect, but it was a power that was closest to perfection. \u00a0If he combined his ability with Maetel\u2019s almost cheat-like talent, they were a perfect pair. \u00a0They had been perfect a moment ago, and they will be perfect in the future. \u00a0There was no reason why they shouldn\u2019t go forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His confidence was baseless, but he was aware of this fact.

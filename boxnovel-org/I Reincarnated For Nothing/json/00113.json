background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As he approached level 220, he continued to train as a thief. \u00a0He was able to sense all life and Mana within a limited region. \u00a0He also learned how to avoid detection of others. \u00a0It was as Artpe had said. \u00a0He possessed genius level talent towards thief-related abilities. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">When he thought about it, it was very suspicious. \u00a0Silpennon frowned. \u00a0Even as his mind struggled over this problem, there was no adverse effects to the body. \u00a0He continued to move quickly as he avoided the Mana Net that filled the whole area. \u00a0He was able to easily get past the traps as he approached Artpe\u2019s lodging.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He had received maps with locations of Dungeons from Artpe. \u00a0As he methodically cleared the Dungeons, he was able to train his thief skills for two years. \u00a0He had a basic plan of action on how he should act in an unknown territory.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">We wasn\u2019t a warrior that was wearing an invincible armor. \u00a0He wasn\u2019t a magician that possessed powerful magic. \u00a0If he was asked to fight enemies head on or destroy a building in its entirety, it was beyond his ability.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It didn\u2019t matter if it was a Dungeon or a ruin. \u00a0He infiltrated them first to make sure that his safety was assured.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He slowly crawled through a region like a spider as he expanded his knowledge of a region. \u00a0When he gathered all the information, he seized his target. \u00a0He did this last. \u00a0It allowed him to cleanly escape after acquiring his target. \u00a0This was Silpennon\u2019s mindset as a thief.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He used his quick feet to safely avoid several secret traps, and he was able to enter into the residential area. \u00a0He was able to read the signature of the people moving within. \u00a0He moved quickly and stealthily as he avoided coming across them. \u00a0He reached the room pointed out by Artpe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">No. \u00a0In truth, there was another room that worried him before he reached Artpe\u2019s room.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Silpennon let out a sigh as he grabbed the door to the room. \u00a0He used a specialized thief skill called \u2018Quiet Infiltration. \u00a0 He disabled the alarm and observation type magic as he picked the lock. \u00a0He opened the door. \u00a0He was able to do everything without making a sound..</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

When he made sure no one else was approaching Silpennon\u2019s domain, he took off his hood. \u00a0He revealed his face. \u00a0If he wanted to communicate with her, he would have to get rid of attire that was causing the fear within her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

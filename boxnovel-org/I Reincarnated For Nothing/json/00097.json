background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">When the magicians realized that they couldn\u2019t completely control Regina, the king of that era worked with the magicians to come up with a method that was better than the power of suggestion. \u00a0They started researching a spell that would give them complete control over Regina. \u00a0In the end, they came to a conclusion that magic couldn\u2019t coerce the mind of a person\u2026. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This waas why they started to dabble in black magic.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Not all black magic were the same. \u00a0It didn\u2019t matter what type of magic it was. \u00a0Depending on how any magic was used, it could create a horrific result. \u00a0On the other hand, black magic needed a price in exchange for its use. \u00a0It required sacrifice of other beings. \u00a0This was why it was called black magic, and it was widely recognized as something only the Demon race used.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was the reason why black magic was strictly forbidden since the founding of the magic kingdom of Aedia. \u00a0They acted as the custodian of black magic. \u00a0 It was also the reason why the kingdom had a large amount of information that dealt with black magic.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At first, they started researching for a way to coerce Regina with magic. \u00a0As expected, their research started to slowly spread into other interests.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Once they succumbed to the temptation, there was no restraint holding them back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was why Aedia had worked with Tiata. \u00a0They researched for a way to control the Elves.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u2018Since the Elves weren\u2019t human, they convinced themselves that it would be all right. \u00a0However, would that be enough for them? \u00a0No way.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The research into magic that dominated the Elves were merely a ridiculous justification. \u00a0How could the spell they were researching actually differentiate between other races?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They had created a red line that said everything would be fine if they didn\u2019t use it against humans. \u00a0In truth, the experiment didn\u2019t discriminate between Elves, humans or Demites. \u00a0It would be an absolute Control magic. \u00a0In some ways, it was more evil than the Innate ability of the Demon King.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the case of the Demon King, he either controlled everyone, or he destroyed anyone that he couldn\u2019t control. \u00a0He was a monster, yet he hadn\u2019t shown interest in the Control magic being researched by the humans.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The reason was quite simple. \u00a0The Demon King already possessed an Innate ability called the Absolute Control. \u00a0He also came to the conclusion that it was impossible to dominate another being with the power of magic. \u00a0It had to be an Innate Ability.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was the actual truth. \u00a0In his past life, Aedia\u2019s spell resulted in truly horrendous side effects. \u00a0This was why the Elves went out on an all out war against the humans. \u00a0By the end of the war, the Elves were nearly wiped out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Forest went up in flames, and no new Elves appeared afterwards. \u00a0Several nation became ruined in this war, and that was when the Demon King\u2019s army began fighting the hero\u2019s party in earnest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

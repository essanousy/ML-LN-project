background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At times, a heat wave swept over the Demon realm, so it was a hot place to live. \u00a0Despite the temperature, everyone adapted and they got used to the heat. \u00a0They lived pretty well. \u00a0Moreover, there were regions that were colder than the northernmost continent of human realm. \u00a0 The Demon realm was balanced.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If one assessed the situation in a logical manner, the Demon realm didn\u2019t need to invade the human realm. \u00a0A war was usually started when one side was lacking in something. \u00a0One took away what one needed from others through war. \u00a0 However, the Demon realm had everything, so why did they need to go and quarrel with the human realm? \u00a0What did they want?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">While she was alive, distance didn\u2019t matter. \u00a0She was able to circumvent distance to communicate with her subjects. \u00a0In a case of emergency, all the Genesis Mermaids would pull together to create an encircling net. \u00a0It would be a blockade to stop the Demons.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cHowever, if your people are faced with a great number of Demons that they can\u2019t handle, I want you to order a retreat. \u00a0The human realm has forces too. \u00a0I don\u2019t want your people to weaken in the process of stopping the Demons. \u00a0It is unnecessary and idiotic to do so.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

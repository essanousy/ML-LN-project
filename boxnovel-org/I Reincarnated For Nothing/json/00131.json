text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Until the 6th floor, the 3 man group of Sienna, Regina and Vadinet was sufficient in clearing the Dungeon. \u00a0Artpe provided Mana when needed to his party members as he worked on the magic tome. \u00a0However, monsters over level 300 started appearing on the 7th floor. \u00a0This was when they started hunting in earnest as a 5 man party.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At first, Artpe was a bit worried as to how to deploy the party. \u00a0This was the first time he had experienced being in a 5 man party. \u00a0In the end, he put Sienna and Maetel in the front. \u00a0Artpe was in charge of containment and support. \u00a0Regina brought up the rear as she used her AoE magic to kill the monsters. \u00a0Lastly, Vadinet was in charge of heals and buffs. \u00a0The speed at which they cleared the Dungeon became incredibly fast.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Above all else, the prior party arrangement had relied very heavily on Artpe\u2019s Mana. \u00a0Since he was able to escape that party structure, he spent less time resting. \u00a0He needed less need to recover his Mana, and he was less fatigued.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cIt seems we were the problem until now. \u00a0Whether it was investigating the ruin or containing the monsters, we left it all to Artpe-nim. \u00a0 We were in the wrong. \u00a0Hoo. \u00a0It seems our lack of skill is at fault\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Maetel said those words, but she looked chastised by Vadinet\u2019s words. \u00a0Since she was only good at fighting, she might have overly relied on Artpe in all other aspects. \u00a0She might have shifted too much responsibility onto him. \u00a0This wasn\u2019t something new. \u00a0She had such thoughts before.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After the 7th floor, they worked diligently for another 10 days before they reached the 9th floor. \u00a0They were able to find the staircase leading down to the 10th floor, which was the last floor of the ruin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Artpe easily extracted the rewards from te Dungeon. \u00a0He did it so well that it made one question as to how he was able to find everything the Dungeon had to offer. However, Artpe\u2019s party members were used to this sight now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It wasn\u2019t something one could do, because one could sense Mana. \u00a0He had an ability that could catch small discrepancies that even a highly trained thief couldn\u2019t catch. \u00a0He had the the ability to reveal all secrets! \u00a0 It didn\u2019t matter if his party had expanded in number. \u00a0It didn\u2019t matter that his comrades were able to help him in many ways. \u00a0It was still up to Artpe to find the rewards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After he cleaned out the 9th floor of its rewards, Artpe turned around to face his party. \u00a0He handed them small clear crystals. \u00a0He gave several dozen to each of them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He had started gathering them from the 1st floor of the Dungeon. \u00a0It had been scattered in random locations. \u00a0The party members had wondered if these functioned similar to magic stones. \u00a0However, the crystal held a very minute amount of ice type magical energy. \u00a0They couldn\u2019t feel any large power within it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cWhat are they?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cThey are consumable Artifacts capable of absorbing a finite amount of cold energy. \u00a0The amount of cold energy they can store is limited. \u00a0However, we do have a lot of them, so I think it\u2019ll work out somehow.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">For reference, the crystals could be consumed after they were completely charged with cold energy. \u00a0They were helpful in casting Ice type magic. \u00a0However, there was no point in casting ice type spells in this ruin, since they wouldn\u2019t be effective. \u00a0The crystals wouldn\u2019t be used for that purpose.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The party immediately descended the staircase towards the 10th floor. \u00a0The staircase was wide, and it was seemingly endless. \u00a0They busily descended the spiral staircase, and they moved further and further away from the ceiling. \u00a0The air around them continued to get colder. \u00a0They could feel a strange Mana emanate from the heart of the staircase.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">When Artpe felt the flow of this strange Mana, he raised his head as he smirked. \u00a0He was just reminded of a memory from his past life. \u00a0The rest of his party was a beat late in sensing the Mana. \u00a0They tilted their head in puzzlement.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cIt feels as if we passed through something. \u00a0How strange.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cIt isn\u2019t strange. \u00a0The staircase has the role of a watcher. \u00a0It classifies the intruders of this ruin. \u00a0Also, it is a sign that we are on the right path.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He nodded his head when he was faced with something quite different from what he had found in his past life.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the time, Artpe had one goal. \u00a0He wanted to take the sculpture to Etna. \u00a0He knew the staircase was guiding him towards a different route from his past life, but he didn\u2019t resist. \u00a0It was because he knew that something he desired was at the end of all of this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At some point in time, they were greeted by a hallway made out of ice. \u00a0It looked as if it was made out of clear glass.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They arrived at the 10th floor of the Winter Queen\u2019s ruin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cUntil the 9th floor, it looked as if nature had created those floors. \u00a0This place was constructed according to a specific plan.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The hallway was decorated with ice crystals that shone with a magical light. \u00a0In the previous floors, many monsters had harassed the party. \u00a0It had been annoying. \u00a0They couldn\u2019t see a single ant at the entrance to the 10th floor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After Artpe was successful in acquiring it from Silpennon, he had used Reinforcement three times. \u00a0Its performance was brought up close to its limit. \u00a0If needed, he can use the magic stone to put it through additional Reinforcement.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">On the other hand, it had a downside of needing to be recharged once all the Mana within the book was consumed. \u00a0Despite this downside, the Tome of Destruction was a very good Artifact.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

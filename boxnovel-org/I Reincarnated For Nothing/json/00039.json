She was changed into an existence that didn\u2019t get hungry much. \u00a0This was why Sienna helped out in the distribution. \u00a0Of course, Mycenae showed interest in her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOh my. \u00a0You have very pretty hair.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI want you to give me an artifact that can conceal her identity.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI was wondering why you haven\u2019t asked me about that. \u00a0You always seems to meet people of suspect origin. \u00a0Or maybe those kinds of people are drawn to you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHa.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe snorted at Mycenae\u2019s words as he went around the communal space. \u00a0Every time he disturbed a location a wooden box would suddenly appear out of thin air or the lichen growing in the cracks of the Dungeon\u2019s wall would let out a strange light.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He went to four locations to gather the rewards, but as expected, they weren\u2019t worth much.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt should be around 29 gold.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, here is your 29 gold. \u00a0Also, this is a bonus for my dear customer.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe handed off all the items, and he received a small hairpin from her. \u00a0It was a metal adornment shaped like a butterfly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis stops the magical energy reaction from leaking out. \u00a0The artifact has a very simple function, but it should be enough for the girl.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Mycenae had decided this item was enough for Sienna. \u00a0Her hair and skin was unusual, but it could be dismissed as being not too out of the ordinary for a girl of her age.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI want one Crystal Ball of Blessing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Artpe had other ideas.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou want that too!? \u00a0Is it because this child is a demon?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Mycenae was shocked. \u00a0She tried to get a closer look at Sienna, but Artpe didn\u2019t allow any further inquiry. \u00a0In the end, Mycenae pouted as she handed him a Crystal Ball of Blessing for 500 gold.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, this is the end to our transaction. \u00a0You should head back for now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow can you push me out so coldly every time like this? \u00a0Still, I won\u2019t give up. \u00a0I\u2019ll someday make you the king of the business world! \u00a0You better be prepared for it!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAjumma, don\u2019t try to steal Artpe!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI told you to stop doing that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After Mycenae made another loud commotion, he put away the Crystal Ball of Blessing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sienna stared at him as she asked him a question</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOppa, what is that for?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed she had become sensitive to Mana when she was turned into a Evil Reflector. \u00a0It seemed she was very interested in the artifact.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe let out a small laugh as he stroked her head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll tell you about it a little bit later.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A short amount of time had passed. \u00a0All the children were brought outside, and Artpe returned the children to the townspeople. \u00a0In a flash, a reunion filled with tears occurred\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMommyyyyy!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSon! \u00a0M...my son!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Fortunately, most of the children taken from this particular town were all safe. \u00a0The townspeople were deeply moved by the return of the children, so they started praising Artpe and Maetel.

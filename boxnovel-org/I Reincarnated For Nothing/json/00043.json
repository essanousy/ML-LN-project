His enemies would be swept away by the sewage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBoulders\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u00a0There are large boulders\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span

that he had excavated from the construction work. \u00a0He sent them rolling as he caused the landslide.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKoo-ahhhhhhhk!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cR...run away\u2026. \u00a0Kah-ahk!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Several thousand soldiers immediately died before they could enter into a battle. \u00a0They hadn\u2019t even been able to locate their enemies before they were hit with a natural disaster. \u00a0\u00a0The road to mountain wasn\u2019t steep. \u00a0However, a considerable number of soldiers and black magicians had already suffered horrible deaths.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDevil.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere\u2019s a devil here!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cA devil lives in this mountain! \u00a0Run away!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Who would actually want to climb up this mountain? \u00a0The morale of the soldiers immediately bottomed out. \u00a0The black magicians were too afraid of the unknown beings that resided on top of the mountain, so their feet were stuck to the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf they are able to use such tactics, what level are these magicians! \u00a0How many of them are there!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh ooh. \u00a0This is terrifying. \u00a0What spell was that? \u00a0I...I can\u2019t win against that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe\u2019s purple eyes let out a steady light as he moved his fingers through the air. \u00a0The Mana Strings followed the movements of his fingers as additional landslides occurred.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The structure of all creation was seen through his eyes, so it was possible to know what would happen if certain parts were severed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKooo-ahhhhhhhhhhk!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cH...help me\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOh Demon King!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The death throes of numerous people rang out. \u00a0Death upon death was piling on as their blood became a lake, and their corpses became a hill. \u00a0As if to add insult to injury, casualties continued to mount.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, they had nowhere else to go. \u00a0If they were able to act freely, they would have left at the outset.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuhk!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cL...look at what\u2019s happening down there. \u00a0What\u2019s going on\u2026...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI...it\u2019s an earthquake.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the townspeople became aware of the fact that something was happening nearby. \u00a0It was almost miraculous, but their current location was left alone. \u00a0Still, the rest of the mountain was collapsing, so they couldn\u2019t help but notice it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe soldiers below\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe magician-nim is wiping them out.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe isn't making any large gestures. \u00a0He is just waving his hands!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was using Mana Strings in conjunction with his Read All Creation ability. \u00a0He looked like a god to the people around him. \u00a0In truth, this was all possible, because he had made countless preparations beforehand. \u00a0The people around him didn\u2019t know this fact. \u00a0Basically, his abilities were great for bluffing!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The difference between a Four Heavenly King and a hero is paper thin.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe was pleased as he waved his hands. \u00a0An additional 100 soldiers died from one wave, and another 80 died at his next gesture. \u00a0Endless pain, screams and despair filled the bottom of mountain. \u00a0However, Artpe didn\u2019t pay the slightest attention to them. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He already knew this would happen from the beginning. \u00a0This was why he had sent Maetel to a different location. \u00a0Maetel was now adept at discerning between good and evil. \u00a0However, she couldn't put aside her tendency to shoulder every death onto her shoulders.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018However, I\u2019m able to shrug it off.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the very least, the part of him that was the Four Heavenly King of the Demon King\u2019s army was better suited for this task than a hero. \u00a0He was able to kill strangers to accomplish his goals. \u00a0It was something one couldn\u2019t do unless one was able easily forget about such deeds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had lived under the unreasonable orders from the Demon King. \u00a0He had lived through an unreasonable world. \u00a0When the numbers of beings he had killed exceeded a million, it was possible for him to forget about their deaths. \u00a0Therefore, there was no way Artpe would feel much when he was killing those that deserved death!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs it about done now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had waved his hands for an hour. \u00a0When Artpe confirmed that no troops were entering into the mountain, he retracted his hands. \u00a0At this point, the mountain looked completely different from before.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, if we can get up and down from this place, it should be fine.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI wonder if we can be prosperous living on this mountain\u2026...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This place that had been normal mountain A to the villagers. \u00a0However, this mountain would now be long remembered in history. \u00a0They had a faraway look as they looked at their residential environment, but they couldn\u2019t make their complaints known to Artpe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Artpe knew what they were feeling inside.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou should focus on the construction instead of paying attention to me. \u00a0Do you really think it\u2019ll end with just one attack?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHeek!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cA...a force of that size is going to come again?!?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt might be a larger force. \u00a0It\u2019ll be good for you guys if I can take care of them while I\u2019m still here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A chill went up their spines when they heard his words. \u00a0The people meekly went back to work. \u00a0Artpe snorted as he exited the construction site.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018So then, let\u2019s\u2026....\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had purposefully spared one person. \u00a0Amongst the black magicians, there had been one that possessed decent power, yet he had been very passive. \u00a0He kept looking around at his surrounding in a cautious manner. \u00a0Artpe buried everyone except him. \u00a0He let this particular magician run away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bastard probably thought he was lucky. \u00a0He probably thought that he had survived, because he had more sense than the others. \u00a0To be precise, Artpe had enticed the black magician to act this way. \u00a0Artpe had made the black magician think that he was clever in his escape.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the black magician never escaped Artpe\u2019s sight from the beginning to the end.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Reinforcement.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While Artpe was walking quickly, he used the Reinforcement skill on his boots.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It immediately allowed him to activate the Blink magic. \u00a0The ability of the boots had been amplified, so he would be able to use Blink once or twice a day without consuming any of his Mana. \u00a0It also considerably extended the range of the Blink magic. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he could advance in his Reinforcement skill, he could probably use an additional Blink. \u00a0However, his current capabilities was enough.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHmmph!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe used consecutive Blinks as he kicked off the ground. \u00a0In a flash, he was already running across the base of the mountain. \u00a0In his previous life, it would have been impossible for him to move like this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He never imagined there would come a day when he would be able to physically exert himself like this. \u00a0The title of a Hero wasn\u2019t an empty one. \u00a0As he had leveled up in the past year, he hadn\u2019t just grown in terms of magical energy. \u00a0His physical stats had also made rapid progress.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, his physical abilities were laughable when compared to a level 160 Warrior, but he was on a different level when compared to a mage of similar level. \u00a0Artpe looked exactly like a typical magician on the outside. \u00a0This was why they wouldn\u2019t know about Artpe\u2019s physical capabilities. \u00a0This gave him an advantage against his opponents.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAnother Blink and\u2026. Good. \u00a0I caught you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKuhk!?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had quickly descended the mountain, and he was finally successful in grabbing the black magician by the back of his neck. \u00a0As expected of a cautious and meticulous person, the black magician was equipped with an Artifact that attacked an ambusher. \u00a0However, it was effective only if the enemy was unaware of the trap.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Artpe knew the activation condition of the Artifact. \u00a0He also knew its shape, structure and power. \u00a0When he grabbed the black magician, he immediately destroyed it with his Mana String. \u00a0The Artifact didn\u2019t activate.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuhk!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The black magician was shocked when he realized this fact. \u00a0He had already realized that his opponent was on a different level than him. \u00a0It was enough for him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cP...please spare me! \u00a0I\u2019ll tell you everything!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. \u00a0I was hoping you would say that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKuhk!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe moved as if he was about to charge forward, but he used the motion to plant his opponent\u2019s head into the ground \u00a0If he found out Artpe was a child, he might show some bravado. \u00a0\u00a0He had to pressure his opponent from the perch of absolute power. \u00a0It would allow him to easily extract information out of the man.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe put his foot on the man\u2019s back as he asked the question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo, which Demon is cooperating with the Archduke?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a limit on how abrupt a topic should be broached. \u00a0Artpe had already concluded that the Archduke was behind all of this, and he was cooperating with a Demon. \u00a0He skipped over those parts to ask the next question!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed the black magician was taken aback by Artpe\u2019s question, so he carefully opened his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDemon? \u00a0I don\u2019t know\u2026. \u00a0Heek.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe extended his Mana String, and he leisurely placed it around his opponent\u2019s finger. \u00a0It felt as if the Mana String was sharp enough to sever his finger at any moment. \u00a0The man gulped.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe spoke in a low voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYour life is worth nothing to me, but I\u2019m guessing that isn\u2019t true for you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cC...correct.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat means your words must change next time you speak.

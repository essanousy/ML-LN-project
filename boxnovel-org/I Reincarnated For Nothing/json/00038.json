\u00a0Artpe was feeling an emotion that clashed with him at a fundamental level, so he became self-absorbed in it. \u00a0However, at that moment, someone tugged at his robe. \u00a0Of course, it was Sienna.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOppa!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, you did well.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe was breaking out in cold sweat as he smiled. \u00a0He stroked her head as he comforted her. \u00a0Her skin remained pale, and her hair was white too. \u00a0However, her hair was lustrous. \u00a0Unlike before, she was full of life energy and magical energy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had white skin, and white luminous hair. \u00a0Sienna looked very alien, but this actually made look very charming.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She looked a little bit younger than Maetel, and the girl let out a bright and innocent smile towards her rescuer. \u00a0She had met Artpe for the first time today, but the smile contained an unlimited amount of trust towards Artpe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThank you, oppa\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. \u00a0I gained some very good data thanks to you. \u00a0I should be the one thanking you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHeh heh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From the moment Sienna started becoming a demon to the moment where she became an Evil Reflecter, he had observed and recorded everything with his Read All Creation ability. \u00a0Of course, it was still impossible for him, but this record would allow him to research a method to counter the demonifying curse. \u00a0He might be able to come up with a method that\u2019ll allow him to resist against the Demon King\u2019s ability.!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSienna!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUnni.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe let go of Artpe\u2019s robe, and she rested herself completely on the floor. \u00a0She hugged her unni, who had run towards her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel had looked on with a nervous heart. \u00a0She had been sad at the thought of one more child becoming a monster. \u00a0Maetel and the other children were truly relieved at the sight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m glad you are fine.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is all thanks to oppa. \u00a0Oppa helped me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7mmmm.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel had a smile on her face. \u00a0However, when she heard Sienna\u2019s bright voice and face, she started creeping towards Artpe\u2019s side. \u00a0She grabbed his robe. \u00a0There was still a smile on her face, but there was a sense of gloominess that was a small part of her expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is a relief that Sienna is fine. \u00a0Right, Artpe?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt feels as if there is a smidge of regret in your voice, Maetel.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are mistaken. \u00a0I\u2019m really happy. \u00a0I want Aena and Sienna to live a happy life. \u00a0At the town\u2026 Just the two of them...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Mmm. \u00a0It seemed he hadn\u2019t been mistaken. \u00a0Maetel was burning with jealousy towards a girl that was younger than her. \u00a0\u00a0Why was the hero wired like this!

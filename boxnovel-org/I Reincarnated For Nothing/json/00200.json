I know you\u2019ve killed my poor successor. \u00a0However, I\u2019m very lenient when it comes to a cute child. \u00a0Did you say your name was Artpe? \u00a0You don\u2019t have to be lost any more. \u00a0You should return to the Demon race. \u00a0I\u2019ll hold you in my bosom.]</span></p><br/><p><span>Her gaze was fixed on Artpe. \u00a0She knew that Artpe was the backbone of the hero\u2019s party. \u00a0She knew that Artpe was the one that had a hand in growing his party members to this extent.</span></p><br/><p><span>Above all else, he was manifesting a spell through his staff and magic tome! \u00a0He was turning the Demon realm into the human realm, and her Demon underlings had been turned into humans. He was someone with overwhelming power! \u00a0She had lost everyone that had acted as her hands and feet. \u00a0Even as she surveyed her enemies, she was thinking about how to bring him under her as an underling.</span></p><br/><p><span>[I\u2019ll tell you this now. \u00a0It is meaningless to go against me. \u00a0My existence is a miracle in itself. \u00a0I am this world\u2019s first and the last! \u00a0I am the proof that the Demonic god exists. \u00a0I am his daughter. \u00a0I do not want to kill you. \u00a0That is why you should walk towards me of your own volition. \u00a0You should embrace me. \u00a0I do not lie.]</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cEach word you speak is dripping with Demonic energy. \u00a0That means\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe maintained his spell as he took in the sight of her. \u00a0His Read All Creation ability did a great job in delivering her information to him.</span></p><br/><p><span>[Garnet Orzodia]</span></p><br/><p><span>[Demon King]</span></p><br/><p><span>[Level : 419]</span></p><br/><p><span>[Innate Ability : Seduction]</span></p><br/><p><span>[The Mana of a whole race was used to complete the seal. \u00a0Despite being freed from the seal, the aftereffects remains. \u00a0Her full power hasn\u2019t been recovered yet.]</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe\u2019s party had acted too fast, so she had come out before she had regained her full power. \u00a0Despite this fact, it was as she boasted. \u00a0She was plenty strong.</span></p><br/><p><span>It burned for Artpe to admit this, but he had to acknowledge that the current Demon King had been right once again. \u00a0Artpe\u2019s party had to go through the experience of fighting the current Demon King and the fragment of the Demonic god. \u00a0If they hadn\u2019t, they wouldn\u2019t have stood a chance against Garnet Orzodia.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cShe is level 419. \u00a0However, she had been sealed. \u00a0She\u2019s been weakened significantly after she was released from the seal. \u00a0We just have to do the same thing we did against the current Demon King and the fragment of the Demonic god.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cArtpe always speaks as if it'll be easy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The previous Demon King was a terrifying monster. \u00a0However, he had already expected this when her existence was alluded to. \u00a0 The only thing his party needed right now was determination.</span></p><br/><p><span>Maetel and Sienna moved to the front. \u00a0The rest of the party slowly moved backwards as they got in formation. \u00a0Regina raised her staff in order to protect all of them.</span></p><br/><p><span>[It'll be futile even if everyone attacks me all at once. \u00a0Will it be ok sending out only the two of them? \u00a0Moreover, you are maintaining the great magic.]</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDon\u2019t listen to that woman\u2019s words. \u00a0Her Innate ability is called Seduction. \u00a0It is a technique that can make a hero into an idiot. \u00a0In fact, that idiot is right over there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>[Oh my. \u00a0You are quite the cold-hearted child. \u00a0I haven\u2019t told you the name of my ability, yet you spoke it out loud. \u00a0It feels as if you\u2019ve undressed me. \u00a0Aren\u2019t you progressing too fast in make a move on me?]</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019m killing that woman for sure.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7since she is raising your fighting spirit, I won\u2019t say anything.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Nanarai Bodra was letting out a powerful Demonic energy as he hovered near Garnet Orzodia. \u00a0It was as if he was trying to protect her. \u00a0His nose flared as he looked at her. \u00a0It was a really pathetic sight, but his behavior was in line with his past image.</span></p><br/><p><span>[If it wasn\u2019t for you, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to unravel her seal. \u00a0As the level and the quality of the subject being sealed increases, it becomes harder to break the seal.]</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou are the one that had placed the seal, yet you weren\u2019t able to unseal it. \u00a0It validates my idea that you\u2019ve lost a significant portion of your memories.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They no longer needed to listen to Nanarai Bodra. \u00a0Above all else, they had to stop Garnet Orzodia before she talked any more. \u00a0Did Etna share a hive mind with Artpe? \u00a0Etna immediately attacked Nanarai Bodra.</span></p><br/><p><span>[I\u2019m sorry, but you cannot kill this man until we achieve what we desire\u2026. \u00a0Hoohp!]</span></p><br/><p><span>The previous Demon King immediately moved to block Etna. \u00a0However, Sienna had followed up behind Etna. \u00a0She brought her hammer down, and the hammer crushed the spot where Garnet Orzodia had occupied. \u00a0Sienna was also a heavy weight that was over level 400!</span></p><br/><p><span>Sienna wasn\u2019t the hero. \u00a0Garnet Orzodia never expected someone in the hero\u2019s party other than the heroes to possess so much power, so she dodged in surprise. \u00a0However, her surprise didn\u2019t end there.</span></p><br/><p><span>[What\u2019s going on\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 Ah, ahhhhhh.]</span></p><br/><p><span>[You are a thorn in my side!]</span></p><br/><p><span>When Nanarai saw Garnet\u2019s torment, he let out a shout in anger. \u00a0His gaze was planted squarely on Artpe. \u00a0To be precise, he was looking at the small white bell that was swinging slowly in Artpe\u2019s hand.</span></p><br/><p><span>[I\u2019ve never heard of such an Artifact!]</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAlright. \u00a0He took the bait, Etna!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cRoger!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe was successful in baiting the idiot! \u00a0Flame coated Etna\u2019s entire body, and she charged straight towards Nanarai Bodra.</span></p><br/><p><span>She possessed a peerless Innate ability that was geared towards combat. \u00a0Nanarai Bodra was being weakened by the Declaration of Demonic Extermination, so Etna was on par with him! Moreover, Nanarai was adept at dealing with magic. \u00a0He was having a hard time countering attacks made through the power of a Fire Spirit. \u00a0He could do nothing as he allowed Etna to damage his body.</span></p><br/><p><span>[It can\u2019t be helped. \u00a0Since you guys are being so violent and unreasonable\u2026\u2026. \u00a0 It\u2019ll hurt a little bit, but you should endure it. \u00a0Afterwards, I\u2019ll have plenty of time to soothe your pain away.]</span></p><br/><p><span>Garnet Orzodia gritted her teeth. \u00a0The Declaration of Demonic Extermination kept ringing, and it felt as if her head would be split open. \u00a0However, it was merely an Artifact. \u00a0How could she be called the conqueror of the Demonic realm if she couldn\u2019t even overcome a single Artifact!</span></p><br/><p><span>Maetel and Sienna had raised their weapons as they glared at Garnet. \u00a0Garnet raised her hand towards the two girls. \u00a0Without any warning, magic missile erupted from Garnet\u2019s hand, and the spell attacked the two girls. \u00a0The magic missiles were a light attack, yet it was too powerful to be ignored!</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIf we dodge, Artpe will be hurt!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis is gonna hurt more than a little bit\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The profound power of Acceleration was added to Maetel\u2019s sword strike. \u00a0She quickly cut through the magic missiles. \u00a0Sienna blocked the fragments of the magic missiles with her shield. Garnet had planned up on moving in close after she had fired her magic missiles. \u00a0However, Maetel\u2019s single sword strike continued to split through the air. \u00a0The strike was infused with Mana, and it flew straight towards Garnet. \u00a0She quickly moved to dodge it.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDon\u2019t touch Artpe!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>As if it was inevitable, Garnet raised her arm to block Maetel\u2019s sword strike.</span></p><br/><p><span>[You aren\u2019t just a cute child\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7!]</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSince you are really old, I can see why you are looking for cute things.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>[Ho-oh.]</span></p><br/><p><span>Maetel\u2019s provocation was successful! \u00a0Garnet moved in very close to Maetel as she detonated her Demonic energy. \u00a0She tried to attack Maetel, but it was too late. \u00a0Sienna had gotten close, and she pushed Garnet with her shield.</span></p><br/><p><span>Sienna had given up on directly attacking Garnet. \u00a0She was just trying to protect Maetel with her shield. \u00a0She was trying to create an opportunity where Maetel would be able to attack Garnet.</span></p><br/><p><span>[You magical energy is unique\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7?]</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUnni, I\u2019ll leave it to you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes. \u00a0I\u2019ll protect Artpe.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Maetel took the Mana of an Evil Reflector from Sienna. She infused it within her sword. \u00a0In the nick of time, Vadinet\u2019s blessing was placed over the two girls. \u00a0At the same time, Vadinet\u2019s curse hit Garnet. \u00a0The tide of battle changed in an instant.</span></p><br/><p><span>[This is an annoyingly familiar sight. \u00a0In the past, Nanarai stressed the importance of his comrades in front of me\u2026.. \u00a0However, he is mine now!]</span></p><br/><p><span>As Garnet moved, countless magic missles formed in her wake. \u00a0Garnet didn\u2019t have an Innate ability like the dead current Demon King. \u00a0However, she was able to mentally subjugate other using her Seduction ability. \u00a0On top of that, she possessed a massive reservoir of Demonic energy.</span></p><br/><p><span>Simple plans didn\u2019t work against her. \u00a0One couldn\u2019t simply attack her weak point. \u00a0In many aspects, she really was the prototypical Demon King.</span></p><br/><p><span>[The magic missiles are weakening\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7!?]</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHooo-ahhhhhp!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Of course, even she was weakened in front of the Declaration of Demonic Extermination being rung by Artpe!</span></p><br/><p><span>[We have to destroy that bell!]</span></p><br/><p><span>[You do it, Nanarai! \u00a0I\u2019ll\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 I have to entertain these brats!]</span></p><br/><p><span>Maetel started using her Record Master ability in earnest. \u00a0She gathered the power of her party into herself. \u00a0Maetel\u2019s skill had evolved in the process of fighting the Demon King and the fragment of the Demonic god.</span></p><br/><p><span>Her ability had moved beyond gathering the abilities of her party members. \u00a0The power maximized Maetel\u2019s attack, and as soon Sienna tried to defend and counter attack, the power was transferred to her. \u00a0Her skill was maximizing each other\u2019s abilities to the extreme.</span></p><br/><p><span>Garnet could see the Record being transferred between the two girls, so she tried to attack at the exact moment when the transfer happened. \u00a0Surprisingly, Maetel was too mobile, and she was aware of Garnet\u2019s intention. \u00a0Maetel didn\u2019t give Garnet the chance to exploit the weakness in her skill. \u00a0Garnet gritted her teeth as she met Maetel\u2019s flashing eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>[You bitch\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7!]</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but there will be no stage for you beyond this. \u00a0Everything will end here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The bastard sword contained her indomitable will. \u00a0It let out a white light. \u00a0It was Hero\u2019s Flash.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to exit this stage.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>On the other side, Nanarai Bodra was in a worse situation than the Demon King. \u00a0Etna was the only one in the party that was capable of going toe to toe with Artpe and Maetel! \u00a0This was before she had gained her Spirit Transformation ability. \u00a0Now she was a foe that couldn\u2019t be pushed around by Nanarai Bodra.</span></p><br/><p><span>[Is this perhaps the power of a Spirit? \u00a0Yes, my arm was\u2026..! \u00a0You are a cute woman, yet you are quite rough!]</span></p><br/><p><span>[Can you close your mouth, grandpa? \u00a0Your breath stinks. \u00a0Or else\u2026.. \u00a0 I\u2019ll shut it for you!]</span></p><br/><p><span>Enta punched the air, and tens of thousands of Fire Birds erupted from her fist. \u00a0In a flash, she created an area filled with lava. \u00a0Nanarai tried to manifest his Demonic energy into a spell, but it was burned away by the fire before he could do that. \u00a0At that moment, Etna was as close to being the epitome of her fire attribute.</span></p><br/><p><span>[If you think I\u2019ll continue to suffer under your attack, you are mistaken!]</span></p><br/><p><span>[Hoohp!]</span></p><br/><p><span>In multiple instances, Etna had prevented Nanarai Bodra from activating his spells . \u00a0He had the body of a Demon, yet he suffered from horrifying burns. \u00a0He couldn\u2019t heal from these burns. \u00a0In the end, he gave up on manifesting his spells through Demonic energy.</span></p><br/><p><span>However, this was when the true battle started. \u00a0He quickly swung his one remaining hand. \u00a0It was similar to what the Demon King Garnet had done. \u00a0However, magic missiles of a fundamentally different nature started to pour out. \u00a0The magic missiles couldn\u2019t be compared in the quantity of power they possessed, but surprisingly, magic circles had been nested within the magic missiles. \u00a0When the flames touched the magic missiles, the magic circle within was activated! \u00a0It ate the flames!</span></p><br/><p><span>[I don\u2019t know how long you\u2019ve been with the hero, but I\u2019ve walked down the road of a magician before I became a Demon. \u00a0I was peerless.]</span></p><br/><p><span>[You were overtaken by Artpe in terms of magic.]</span></p><br/><p><span>Etna snorted. \u00a0She was a bit disheartened, since she couldn\u2019t read the spell that was nested within the magic circle. \u00a0However, she couldn\u2019t outwardly display her disappointment.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018I have to be more wary of this man than the Demon King. \u00a0The one that is working on the Demonification of the human realm isn\u2019t the previous Demon King. \u00a0It should be this man\u2026.!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>Even as Nanaria Bodra fought against Etna, he kept glancing towards Artpe\u2019s Reclamation magic. \u00a0This might be a ridiculous idea, but he might be deciphering the Reclamation magic in real time.</span></p><br/><p><span>[I got you.]</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOoh\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 What!?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Even during a battle, Etna was focused on Artpe. Her attention was divided. \u00a0Etna didn't see the magic missile coming towards her. \u00a0She only realized its presence when it hit her body. \u00a0Of course, she thought the flame coating her body would block the magic missile\u2026..</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKoo-hahk!?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>[Checkmate. \u00a0Shall we end this game, my juniors?]</span></p><br/><p><span>The flame around Etna\u2019s body disappeared. \u00a0Etna\u2019s body shook as she fell to the ground. \u00a0Artpe had been injecting his Mana into the magic tome. \u00a0He looked up in shock. \u00a0At that moment, he saw something that he hadn\u2019t been able to see before.</span></p><br/><p><span>[Innate Ability : Magic Circle Creation]</span></p><br/><p><span>[I\u2019m well aware of your Innate Ability.]</span></p><br/><p><span>Nanarai Bodra was the asshole sunbae-nim, who wouldn't let go of their ankles. \u00a0Nanarai Bodra grinned as he spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span>[I devised a magic circle that\u2019ll hide my Record for a short amount of time. \u00a0I guess it worked very well.]</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou son of a bitch\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe grinded his teeth.</span></p><br/><p><span>It seemed his enemy had the ability to manifest Materialization magic through his magic circles.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">In truth, she didn\u2019t mind it. \u00a0Her life was no longer being threatened for liking someone. \u00a0She was plenty happy with that fact. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Silpennon grumbled as he turned his gaze away. \u00a0After Artpe used his Reinforcement ability, the Steel Horse had become its best possible version of itself. \u00a0It was no longer a normal existence. \u00a0It travelled at a mind boggling speed as it traveled above the Demon realm.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Of course, monsters could see them, so there were cases when the monsters tried to chase after them. \u00a0However, they were rarely attacked by Demons. \u00a0It seemed most of the Demons had been mobilized into the human realm.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">At this rate, it might take them couple hours to arrive at their destination. \u00a0The Reinforcement had been used on top of the Dwarven technology, so the impossible was made possible. \u00a0Silpennon laughed at the thought.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">After regaining the memories from his past life, she had been the most sensitive to his change. \u00a0Everyone realized that Silpennon had changed dramatically. \u00a0Unlike everyone else, she was a bit afraid that Silpennon had changed at a fundamental level.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Since she possessed the Innate ability called Assimilation, she might be much more empathetic compared to the others. \u00a0Silpennon absentmindedly thought about her abilities as he tilted his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

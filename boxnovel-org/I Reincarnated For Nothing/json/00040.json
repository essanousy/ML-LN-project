Still, it was better to be worked like a dog than actually being dead.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow, oppa!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGood night, noona!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-uhng, ooh-uh-uhng. \u00a0Mommy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Artpe knew their pain. \u00a0How could he not? \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He watched the townspeople people break up as they shuttled the crying children away. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If they do band together to grow in size, there\u2019s a chance they\u2019ll be able to escape the influence of the demons. \u00a0Of course, when that occurs they\u2019ll try to find other ways to acquire more children\u2026.,...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe and Maetel\u2019s role was to stop this business from getting any larger. \u00a0He would overlooked most calamities. \u00a0However, he had to get in on this or it might swallow the whole human world.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is the hero\u2019s walk of life. \u00a0If not for heroes, others wouldn\u2019t be able to sense such enormous crisis, and they wouldn\u2019t know how to overcome it. \u00a0It isn\u2019t as if the human world doesn\u2019t have strong people. \u00a0However, the trouble makers are hidden until the heroes can find them. \u00a0It is like a game of hide and seek.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the hero finds them, they proudly reveal themselves as if to say \u2018I\u2019m ready now!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were sons of bitches amongst sons of bitches.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you think this is happening in other regions, Artpe?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI hope not, but it is possible. \u00a0This is why this is so annoying.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Artpe\u2019s reply, Maetel\u2019s eyes turned menacing. \u00a0Since this was a problem where his safety wasn\u2019t involved, he had expected her to laugh off most of his words. \u00a0She had a very forgiving nature, yet her face was filled with rage right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe have to beat them up. \u00a0Everyone who tries to make children into monsters are bad!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed her mental attitude had gone through a fundamental change after what she experienced within the Dungeon. \u00a0Artpe was bitter and happy about it at the same time. \u00a0Still, he had to calm her down right now. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t work yourself up too much, Maetel\u2026 \u00a0\u00a0You\u2019ll see much worse in the future.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel didn\u2019t reply to his words. \u00a0She extended her hand to firmly grip his sleeve. \u00a0He extended a hand to stroke her head. \u00a0At that moment, another girl grabbed his other sleeve.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was none other than Sienna.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOppa. \u00a0Oppa should come to our house and sleep.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, magician-nim. \u00a0Our humble\u2026. \u00a0It is a very humble house, but if you don\u2019t mind, we will take you in for the night.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel sent a guarded look towards the two girls. \u00a0The hand that had been petting her head suddenly turned into a light blow to her head with his knuckles.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOuch.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While Maetel gripped her head in pain, Artpe grabbed Sienna\u2019s offered hand as he gave his reply.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe\u2019ll impose ourselves on you guys for a day. \u00a0As it happens, I have something I have to give you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cReally? Yes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sienna let out an innocent laugh as she rejoiced.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe couldn\u2019t help but laugh alongside with her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He would have to sweet talk another girl with a plausible story.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was how he came to reside in the two girl\u2019s house for a night. They had lost their parents, so the two girls lived in a very small and old house. \u00a0It was in disrepair. \u00a0\u00a0It would actually be much less work to build a new hut than repair this one.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After he unpacked his gear, Artpe called for Sienna. He gave her a small crystal ball. \u00a0It was none other than the Crystal Ball of Blessing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHere, take it. \u00a0This is yours.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOppa, you bought it for me!?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sienna hadn\u2019t figured out the exact use of the Crystal Ball of Blessing yet. \u00a0However \u00a0she was sensitive to Mana after she became an Evil Reflector. \u00a0This was why she was aware that a very complex structure of Mana was contained within the Crystal Ball of Blessing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOppa, isn\u2019t this really expensive?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m not giving it to you for free. \u00a0You have to repay me later with a lot of interests. \u00a0It\u2019ll be a compound interest.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, I understand!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since she didn\u2019t know how scary compound interest was, Sienna let out a naive smile as she replied. \u00a0She took the crystal from him. \u00a0Soon, she had a slightly peculiar expression on her face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOppa, it feels as if it is exploring inside me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is a substitute for the priests, and it\u2019ll decide your future path. \u00a0It\u2019ll make a record of you in this world. \u00a0You\u2019ll know when it adapts to you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cY...yes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After awakening as an Evil Reflector, she had already learned the Mana Control. \u00a0Of course, he expected her to receive the Magician Class without much problem</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Sienna]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Level ? 1]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Evil Reflector]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Warrior Priestess]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sienna found out her Class, and when he saw it, Artpe\u2019s eyes turned round. \u00a0Maetel and Aena didn\u2019t know what was going on so they looked on absentmindedly. \u00a0The only thing different was the fact that the crystal ball was know glinting.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It would probably be of help in advancing in her high rank Class\u2026.. No, that wasn\u2019t important right now!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOppa, what happened\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m not sure either.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If she wasn\u2019t a magician, who on this land was actually suited to become a mage! \u00a0\u00a0Moroever, she had escaped her humanity to become a new race that didn\u2019t exist in history, yet she was a priestess!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe was so taken aback by this that he wanted to run out of the house. \u00a0However, his Read All Creation ability hadn\u2019t malfunctioned. \u00a0Instead, her record as a Warrior Priestess was show clearly in front of his eyes. \u00a0There was no double \u00a0Sienna was a Warrior Priestess!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sienna firmly grabbed Artpe\u2019s clothes as she asked him a question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOppa, does this mean I have to enter into a temple?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou must never do that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Sienna\u2019s naive question, Artpe gave an immediate answer. \u00a0Even if a Warrior Priestess was an occupation welcomed by everyone, she wasn\u2019t human anymore. \u00a0There was no way she would be able to enter into the very close-minded temples. If Artpe thought about their temperament, it would be fortunate if Sienna wasn\u2019t dissected for study.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Priests weren\u2019t priests, because they had a good heart. \u00a0Priests followed a specific way of training that had been passed down through time. \u00a0People had researched a way to suck up to selfish gods in an attempt to obtain a boon from them. \u00a0This was how the they awakened to the holy power to become priests!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why she was in a impossible situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Her Mana has progressed in a special direction. \u00a0It\u2019s a holy power that directly opposes evil\u2026. \u00a0It is a likely hypothesis.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The name of her race was Evil Reflector, and the name was quite explicit. \u00a0It also outlined the direction of her development. \u00a0She had been optimized to fight against the demon race. \u00a0She was so amazing that it wouldn\u2019t have been strange if she had been chosen as hero.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wonder what would happen if she was given the opportunity to grow up. \u00a0She was born from an experiment that had tried to turn her into a demon. \u00a0She would now stand in the front line in defeating the Demon race. \u00a0It was the biggest way to screw over the Demon King. \u00a0Moreover, it would allow Artpe\u2019s original goal to\u2026...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Sienna.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe felt a small amount of self-hatred as he bit his lips. However, he had already handed over the Crystal Ball of Blessing to her, so he was being hypocritical by wavering between his decision. \u00a0He kept eye contact with Sienna as he spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou probably lived a normal life until now. \u00a0If this incident hadn\u2019t occurred, you would have continued to live a normal life. \u00a0However, the direction of your life has changed in no uncertain terms. \u00a0In the process, you gained considerable amount of power and potential. \u00a0Now that you have that power it\u2019ll be hard for you to lead a normal life.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the very least, it wouldn\u2019t be possible until the disturbance caused by the Demon King could be put to sleep. \u00a0Sienna was a very bright child, so she fully understood what Artpe was talking about.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. \u00a0Thank you, oppa. \u00a0I also want to live a different life. \u00a0I want to become stronger like oppa. \u00a0I don\u2019t want to be abused by bad people any longer.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was truly courageous words. \u00a0Artpe wonder if what she experienced here had hardened her heart.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maybe, her mental state was affected when she was changed into a new race. \u00a0He just had to hope that he had led her down a better path than becoming a demon..</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe problem is the power you possess is different from theirs. \u00a0The power is unique and alien. \u00a0This is the reason why I gave you the Crystal Ball of Blessing. \u00a0People are afraid of those that are different from them. \u00a0You\u2019ll probably be unable to display your full power out in the open.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOppa, what should I do?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She went to the heart of the matter. \u00a0As Sienna asked her question, it seemed she had an idea what the answer would be. \u00a0This was why there was a look of anticipation on her face. \u00a0\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why kids these days were scary. \u00a0Artpe had this though as he turned to look at Maetel. \u00a0It looked as if Maetel really didn\u2019t like the current situation. \u00a0In the end, she nodded with a sullen expression on her face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She didn\u2019t want someone else to get between Artpe and her. \u00a0However, Maetel knew Sienna couldn\u2019t be left behind now. \u00a0Since her feelings were so transparent, it was a bit amusing to see it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe smirked as he turned to look at Sienna.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then he suggested a way forward for her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7do you want to join our party?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As if she had been waiting for this question, she let out a bright smile as she gave her answer. \u00a0Artpe had asked the question, but he was taken aback by her embarrassingly frank answer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7your whole life depends on this decision. \u00a0Are you sure you ok making such a decision so easily?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou can\u2019t!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Aena interjected herself into the conversation as she screeched. \u00a0She had finally been able to recover her younger sister, yet she was now worried that Sienna would go to a distant place. \u00a0However, Sienna had anticipated her unni\u2019s objection, so she spoke with a bright smile on her face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUnni, don\u2019t worry too much about it. \u00a0I\u2019m all right. \u00a0As time passes, I\u2019ll feel much better.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSienna\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you are with me, I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll become difficult for you. \u00a0You saw it, unni. \u00a0I\u2019m not normal anymore.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As her words ended, a white magical energy was emitted at the tip of Siennna\u2019s fingers. \u00a0Artpe could clearly see a light that was similar to holy power. \u00a0Moreover, the amount of magical energy possessed by her was disparate from her status as a level 1.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI...I...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUnni. \u00a0You can do this alone too, right?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Aena\u2019s expression darkened, but Sienna\u2019s expression remained clear. \u00a0There was a thread of resoluteness that could be seen in her bright smile. \u00a0Aena realized Sienna wasn\u2019t trying to convince her of anything. \u00a0She was just notifying Aena of what would be happening. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sienna had always been a fierce girl that spoke her mind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe won\u2019t be apart forever. \u00a0I\u2019ll come back. \u00a0I promise. \u00a0So you have to wait for me. \u00a0Ok?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSienna\u2026. \u00a0Are you really going to come back to me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, Aena declared her defeat. \u00a0Sienna let out a bright laughter as she tightly hugged Aena.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, I promise.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span

\u00a0The two sisters had embarrassed expressions on their faces.\u00a0 Maetel giggled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The night came to an end in a town that\u2019ll be gone

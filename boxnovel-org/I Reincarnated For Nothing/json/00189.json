font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">For a brief moment, the giant lost its ability move, and the hammer came down on its head with the weight of a mountain behind it. \u00a0Half its head was caved in.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">If he couldn\u2019t gather information using Mana, he just had to rely on his body. \u00a0Unlike a regular magician, he possessed a powerful body. \u00a0He just had to invest a little bit of Mana to strengthen it. \u00a0His Read All Creation could be used to boost his five senses, and he could perfectly read what was going on in his surrounding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Despite doing all this, it was human nature to be worried. \u00a0However, there was no reason to delay the inevitable. \u00a0He was already having a hard time keeping the veil over the eyes of the Demon King.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Artpe grinned as he stepped forward. \u00a0The mere contact with the Demon King\u2019s Demonic energy caused an altered mental status. \u00a0It left behind a faint curse that cause a nasty negative effect. \u00a0Even Roa had a hard time eating such a Demonic energy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

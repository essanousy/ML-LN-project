font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">The party got on the Steel Horse. \u00a0They planned on traveling towards the nearest Warp Gate at full speed. \u00a0They planned on heading straight towards the Demon Realm. \u00a0Their final destination was the Demon King\u2019s castle(or where it used to be)!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">The great magic would start there, and it would cover the entire Demon realm. \u00a0Then the magic will extend further to swallow the Demons. \u00a0This would be true if everything went according to Artpe\u2019s plan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">He really had made all the preparations he could make. \u00a0Currently, Artpe was asking himself as to whether more could have been done. \u00a0Could there be something that he was missing? \u00a0What if some other hidden Demon King made an appearance? \u00a0Were there any more secret Dungeons he could visit?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">He had always traveled down the appointed path.(Although, there were many unexpected and odd turns in the between.) \u00a0The thing that was killing him was the fact that he had to lure in and kill an unknown enemy. \u00a0He didn\u2019t even know the level of this enemy. \u00a0If it was the current Demon King, there was around an 80% chance that his party would win out against him. \u00a0However, this was the previous Demon King, who was stronger than the current Demon King! \u00a0What nonsense was this!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Maybe, he shouldn\u2019t have destroyed the Demon King\u2019s castle. \u00a0Should he have ascertained the location of his enemies before doing that? \u00a0No, if he did that, the already powerful previous Demon King would have received support from the Demon King\u2019s castle. \u00a0The current outcome was better than the alternative.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u2018Fuck. \u00a0I blame the previous hero. \u00a0It is all his fault.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">He sat in the middle of the Steel Horse, which was taking off. \u00a0He had a glum look on his face. \u00a0Maetel suddenly grabbed his hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t worry too much, Artpe.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cArtpe can\u2019t know everything. \u00a0You can\u2019t prepare everything beforehand. \u00a0I think we are as prepared as we are going to be. \u00a0At the very least, that is true in my opinion.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Artpe wondered how she was able to time her words so perfectly. \u00a0It was as if she already knew what was in his heart. \u00a0It was quite odd. \u00a0However, it felt as if she had taken a load off his mind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Yes, if his party was with him\u2026. \u00a0\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Artpe wasn\u2019t suited for the role of a hero, yet he was starting to have cheesy thoughts that was unbecoming of him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Maetel continued to speak..</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cTherefore, you shouldn't worry too much. \u00a0It doesn't matter if it is the current Demon King or the previous Demon King. \u00a0I\u2019ll destroy them all! \u00a0I\u2019ll do it for our child, who will be born soon!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">The war between his party members was about to restart. \u00a0Artpe adeptly maneuvered through the situation as he mobilized the Steel Horse.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Artpe, Maetel, Sienna, Regina, Vadinet, Elrick and Etna were in their own thoughts as they watched the ground fall away. \u00a0If they wanted to parse through all the thoughts in their mind, they would be up all night. \u00a0Even then it wouldn\u2019t be enough time. \u00a0The Steel Horse silently charged forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">When they reached the first warp gate, familiar figures were waiting for them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">It wasn\u2019t just Silpennon. \u00a0His guardian knight Leseti, black magician Deyus, holy priestess Aria, and of course, Dungeon merchant Mycenae was waiting there with Silpennon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">When a hero\u2019s story comes to an end, every notable character usually mobilized. \u00a0Artpe wondered if he was in a similar situation as that. \u00a0Artpe suddenly became a bit sad when he realized the final battle was close at hand. \u00a0Aria put on a bright smile as she tried to cheer him up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cOf course, your presence will be of help\u2026. \u00a0No. \u00a0A holy priestess should be present in the human realm. \u00a0They still need you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Mycenae had spoken. \u00a0He had a rough idea as to what these points were. \u00a0It seemed she planned on bankrupting him. \u00a0They were insisting on coming along. \u00a0It would be heartless to turn them down. \u00a0Artpe let out a bitter laughter as he nodded his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Silpennon\u2019s party was the strongest force in the human realm. \u00a0Their absence would immediately bring hardship to the human realm, but their presence would increase the success rate of Artpe\u2019s plan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Ok. \u00a0It seemed the emperor will have to suffer a little bit more. \u00a0Artpe had such irresponsible thoughts as he opened the door to the Steel Horse. \u00a0The Steel Horse had gone through Reinforcements, so there was plenty of space. \u00a0Even after Silpennon\u2019s party entered the Steel horse, there was enough space left.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Silpennon grinned as he got on the Steel Horse. \u00a0He flinched when he came face to face with Etna. \u00a0Fortunately, both sides tolerated each other\u2019s presence. \u00a0Leseti and Deyus followed in afterwords. \u00a0They had pretty determined expression on their faces. \u00a0\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

This was one of the main reasons why most parties broke up over time. \u00a0If one member of the party increased his level too quickly, it meant the other party member would fall behind. \u00a0As the difference in level becomes more severe, the difference in ability also widened. \u00a0At that point, it was mutually harmful for that party to remain together. \u00a0It was to be expected, since a monster\u2019s level wasn\u2019t fluid. \u00a0It didn\u2019t adjusted to the level of its opponent. \u00a0\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I\u2019m pretty sure this dummy didn\u2019t think that far ahead\u2026 \u00a0She simply doesn\u2019t want a gap to form between the two of us.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe let out a bitter laugh. \u00a0He had wanted to overwhelmingly develop Maetel\u2019s ability. \u00a0This would allow him simply stand in the back. \u00a0He had planned on eating the crumbs off her table. \u00a0However, he had no choice now, since the hero wouldn\u2019t let go of this issue. \u00a0He had to keep step with her to a certain extent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. \u00a0We\u2019ll do that, but my growth rate is much slower than yours. \u00a0It\u2019ll be impossible to match our levels. \u00a0How about we split the monsters evenly?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI really would like it to be the same\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel grumbled as if she didn\u2019t like the idea, but in the end, she accepted it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, let\u2019s head up then.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy are you going up? \u00a0You should stand still.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After Artpe browbeat Maetel, he extended his Mana infused hand. \u00a0He grabbed and pulled at something in the empty air. Suddenly, the stairway in front of them collapsed as a fairly large wooden chest rose up. \u00a0Maetel shouted in joy. \u00a0Artpe winked at her as he gave her an explanation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is a trap. \u00a0If you went up without discovering this box, poisoned needles would have shot out from the floor to kill you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHeeeeek!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOf course, even if someone was lucky enough to find this box, they wouldn\u2019t have known that this is a monster called Mimic. \u00a0It is pretending to be a treasure chest, and most adventurers usually die from its attack.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOooooh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe worst part happens when one identifies and kills the Mimic. \u00a0It shoots out poisoned needles when it is killed.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI don\u2019t like this anymore!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, the level 5 zombies were to be expected inside a Dungeon near a beginner\u2019s town. \u00a0However, they had encountered a pretty elaborate trap within the Dungeon, and that fact did surprise him. \u00a0He was also surprised at finding an Elite monster within the first room of the Dungeon!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The past hero didn\u2019t explore this Dungeon. \u00a0There were only shitty zombies out at the entrance, so she hadn\u2019t even bothered to come into this Dungeon. \u00a0Since this is supposed to be a beginner\u2019s Dungeon, I might have underestimated it\u2026. \u00a0Maybe this Dungeon is\u2026.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This might be a hidden treasure trove. \u00a0Artpe swallowed back the words he had almost blurted out. \u00a0A beautiful flower had its thorns. \u00a0Currently, they needed an opportunity to safely level up. They shouldn\u2019t be putting their life on the line to earn treasures. \u00a0This couldn\u2019t be seen as being all good news. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat should I do, Artpe?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGet back.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe was holding four long nails between his fingers. \u00a0Of course, these were the nails gathered by diligently killing the zombies. \u00a0As expected, it was a lousy weapon. \u00a0It could inflict a very weak poison effect when thrown towards an opponent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, it was an entirely different story if it was used by someone, who could infuse his Mana. \u00a0He could strengthen the items. \u00a0Its toxicity and sharpness was strengthened, but the nails would cease to exist once the Mana was exhausted. \u00a0It was a single use weapon, but it would be able to cause significant amount of damage!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, if one was skilled enough to infuse and strengthen an item, one wouldn\u2019t usually use it on nails acquired from zombies. \u00a0It would be much better to use it on throwing weapons. Still, this method of Mana infusion was only known to those, who suffered from cold and hunger, like Artpe in the past. \u00a0It was a very sad actuality.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEh-eet.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Artpe confirmed that Maetel had retreated behind his back, he quickly and accurately threw four nails towards the box. \u00a0The Mimic had passively stood still like a wooden box, but when the nails were about to hit, it let out a weird sound. \u00a0Then it jumped to avoid the nails\u2026. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s a fake, \u00a0you retard!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Geeeeeeeeeee!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In a flash, the nails changed direction to pierce the wooden box. \u00a0The Mimic hung in the air, and the trap located below its original position activated. \u00a0Several dozen poison needles shot out of the ground to riddle the Mimic\u2019s body with holes!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Gee-geek!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It let a short cry before it became silent. \u00a0It had bitten its tongue in its death.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel, who had stayed silent, carefully asked Artpe a question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs it over\u2026.?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, it is over..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Mimic was one of the rare and special monsters. \u00a0Therefore, the \u2018reward\u2019 it dropped was overwhelmingly better when compared to its difficulty. \u00a0\u00a0As proof, Artpe\u2019s EXP exploded upwards after defeating it. \u00a0He had leveled up twice, and he felt the energy within his body surge forward. \u00a0Even if he hadn\u2019t checked it with his Read All Creation ability, the Mimic was most definitely dead.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cArtpe is really amazing\u2026. \u00a0I never expected you to kill it in such a way!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m going to get sick of hearing that soon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe replied flatly, and he moved towards the dead Mimic. \u00a0The dead Mimic, which had its tongue out, was flipped over by Artpe. \u00a0When he shook it, coins and small daggers fell onto the floor. \u00a0When she saw this, Maetel yelled out in surprise.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI thought this monster wasn't a treasure box. \u00a0What\u2019s going on?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt swallowed humans, who mistook it for a treasure chest. \u00a0It digested everything it could, and the rest are leftovers kept inside its body. \u00a0This is also another reason why it is easy to confuse a Mimic with a treasure chest.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMonsters are really bad\u2026.!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI wouldn\u2019t really say they are bad\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The monsters were born this way. \u00a0Humans slaughtered and ate innocent pigs and cows. \u00a0It was the same with monsters. \u00a0They ate humans. \u00a0This couldn\u2019t be simply be explained by the concept of good and evil. \u00a0Everyone was just struggling to live.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHowever, for us to live, he have to kill all of them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m not sure what you are trying to say, but I\u2019ll defeat anything that torments Artpe!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When she killed the goblins for the first time, she had trembled like a leaf from the shock. \u00a0This happened only yesterday, yet she was quick to act heroic in front of him now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">For a moment, the image of the hero from the past superimposed on the current hero, and it gave him the goosebumps. \u00a0Now that he thought about it, the past hero hadn\u2019t shown any signs of hostility towards him. \u00a0Instead, she had felt sorry and worry for him. \u00a0This truth came to him a bit late. \u00a0He kept a loose smile on his face as he collected the loot from the Mimic.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had earned only 26 bronze coins from killing all the zombies on the first floor. \u00a0The Mimic had barfed out 138 bronze coins. \u00a0Moreover, there were a whopping three silver coins within the loot. \u00a0Each silver coin was worth a 100 times more than a bronze coin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one possessed 2 silver coins, one could feed a family of four for a month. \u00a0Maetel had lived her entire life in the back-country, so of course, the amount made her eyes turn round.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAmazing!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is nothing compared to what you\u2019ll experience and earn from now on.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDon\u2019t say \u2018you\u2019, say \u2018us\u2019!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, yes..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After he roughly ruffled Maetel\u2019s head, he threw the empty husk of the Mimic to the floor. \u00a0\u00a0The dead corpse cleanly vaporized into the air, and in its place, a book was left behind. \u00a0It was as absurd a scene as the goblins spitting out the bronze coins.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is a book...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Mimic is a rare monster that is very hard to encounter. \u00a0Moreover, it is very troublesome to kill. \u00a0This is why the \u2018reward\u2019 is overwhelmingly generous. \u00a0It is generous in terms of EXP and\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It didn\u2019t matter if the content of the book was lousy. \u00a0A magic book was guaranteed to be worth 30 silver coins no matter what. \u00a0He grinned as he picked up the \u2018Skill Book\u2019.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...items. \u00a0If one is able to safely kill the Mimic, it is the same as finding a treasure box.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAmazing!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel couldn't write, but she could read a little bit. \u00a0She clapped her hands as she looked over the book.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAmazing. \u00a0It says Hyper Loving! \u00a0Love means deep affections. \u00a0Didn\u2019t Artpe teach me that before? \u00a0This means this magic is related to love!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh\u2026. \u00a0Mmm. \u00a0Nope.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe hadn\u2019t read the name of the skill...no, he hadn\u2019t read the name of the Spell Book yet. \u00a0When he heard Maetel\u2019s words, his face crumpled in distress. \u00a0Why did such an item have to come out! \u00a0On the other hand, Maetel wasn\u2019t even aware of what Artpe was thinking inside. \u00a0Her cheeks were bright red as she fidgeted in place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWith this magic, Artpe and I\u2026 \u00a0Our l...love will\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt isn\u2019t love. \u00a0It is rub.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat does rub mean?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cRubbing means friction.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c....huh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel tilted her head. \u00a0However, Artpe\u2019s expression was still crumpled in a harsh manner. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a useless spell for him!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Rubbing type spells were divided into Soft Rubbing, Rubbing, Hard Rubbing and Hyper Rubbing. \u00a0\u00a0It looked mysterious, because it was subdivided into 4 types. \u00a0However, its special effect was very simple. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It basically allowed one to rub Mana against one\u2019s enemies!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the off chance that there was some secret meaning hidden behind the spell, Magicians had conducted research on this spell. \u00a0However, nothing much was gained from the studies. \u00a0This didn\u2019t mean the research had been completely fruitless. \u00a0Some high ranking aristocrats, who possessed enough wealth to hire mages, found that the Rubbing magic allowed them to feel some peculiar sensations. \u00a0It opened the door to some awkward possibilities. \u00a0It was best to omit such details.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBasically, Hyper Rubbing is the same as rubbing very hard.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMmm. \u00a0Ooooooh-mmmmm\u2026..?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If there was one advantage to this spell, the Rubbing Skill didn\u2019t have any level restrictions. \u00a0Artpe would have no trouble learning it right now. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At this point, Maetel had another question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo why do you have to learn such a useless magic?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll Skill Books and Spell Books allows one to expand one\u2019s limits, \u00a0It grows one\u2019s abilities. \u00a0This effect occurs just from learning it. \u00a0This is why all Skill Books and Magic Books are expensive despite its content.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was one of the biggest reasons why the hero class was considered to be a cheat. \u00a0The hero could learn all Skills and Spells. \u00a0If there was a supply of Skill Books, the hero could basically learn all of them using just the base ability!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. \u00a0Of course, Skills or Magic can fail if you don\u2019t completely understand what you learned. \u00a0This is why it isn\u2019t such an overwhelming advantage to learn these Books. \u00a0\u00a0The technical term for this is called Failure effects. \u00a0You should remember that term.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFailure effects\u2026.\u00a0 I memorized it!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, this term was unrelated to Artpe. \u00a0He had the Read All Creation. \u00a0He was able to understand all phenomena! \u00a0Artpe immediately learned the Hyper Rubbing, and the purity of his magical energy increased. \u00a0It bolstered his body. \u00a0He felt the overwhelming magical energy fill him, and he let out a deep sigh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-oooooh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if Rubbing was a useless magic, Hyper Rubbing was the best tier amongst the Rubbing magic. Of course, the level of magical knowledge within was high (the result was lousy), and the amount of Mana reacting to the activation of the magic was also enormous (the result was lousy). \u00a0Still, Artpe had gained almost 20 magical energy just from learning the spell. The effect was amazing!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMaybe, this might be better than learning a mediocre spell like the Fire Needle. \u00a0The Mana I can throw around will be stronger than most fireballs.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAs expected, Artpe is amazing!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI knew you were going to say that. \u00a0Let\u2019s go.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had gathered everything that needed to be gathered. \u00a0If one looked only at the results, one could see that they were growing at ridiculous rate. \u00a0He couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that this didn\u2019t feel right to him. \u00a0Still, Artpe had no choice, but to move forward. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel reaffirmed the fact that Artpe was amazing. \u00a0She was filled with pride for him, and she followed behind him like a puppy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The party of heroes safely entered the second floor. \u00a0Then they cleared the third floor and the fourth floor. They were moving so fast through the Dungeon that they were bringing in more supply than they were using. \u00a0They were able to gather weapons and food. \u00a0The most important resource was water, but they were able to solve the problem of acquiring water in the middle of the second floor. \u00a0They had found a spring.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After the Elite Zombie, no Elite monsters had appeared. \u00a0The monsters didn\u2019t stand a chance against Artpe\u2019s poison nails and Maetel\u2019s sword. \u00a0The Dungeon exploration was very easy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was how the two heroes reached the 6th floor of the Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat the hell! \u00a0How long is this Dungeon!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDungeons are really fun! \u00a0Let\u2019s keep going forward!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey! \u00a0There\u2019s a trap over there! \u00a0Stop!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At this point, Maetel was level 29, and Artpe had reached level 24.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Maetel was letting out a bright laughter as she raised her thumb towards Mycenae. \u00a0She was sure that Maetel had learned that gesture from Artpe. \u00a0Mycenae had an odd expression on her face. \u00a0She wondered if she really should be doing this. \u00a0She mumbled to herself as she looked at her surrounding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cHoo-ooh. \u00a0I really wonder if we are doing this for humanity\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">They were in a medium-sized territory within Diaz. \u00a0There was in a shabby building located on the Serata boulevard. \u00a0The headquarters of the Anywhere company was located beneath this building.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cWow. \u00a0I sense people hiding beneath this place. \u00a0What are they all doing here? \u00a0Shouldn\u2019t they be fighting the Demon King\u2019s army?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cThe fight against the Demon King\u2019s army is another business opportunity to the companies. \u00a0This why the companies never go all in on a venture.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Silpennon snorted at Mycenae\u2019s slick explanation. \u00a0The young king of Diaz had been invited as a special guest to the hero\u2019s party. \u00a0The Anywhere company had shamelessly built a secret base within his country. \u00a0Instead of feeling anger, he felt a bit dejected.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">These bastard were all traitors. \u00a0It wouldn\u2019t be enough to annihilate their entire family and relatives.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cI want to loot them, and I really want to put it all back into my kingdom\u2019s coffers\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cHowever, Artpe said to bring it all to him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">She was short and clear with her words as she unsheathed her sword. \u00a0There was a violent air around Maetel. \u00a0Diaz\u2019s coffers had been looted by Artpe, so he thought taking a little bit of the loot would be ok. \u00a0However, he quietly gave up on that idea when he saw Maetel\u2019s savage smile. \u00a0She didn\u2019t look like the girl hero. \u00a0She looked liked a notorious killer. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u2018I\u2019m pretty sure Maetel remembers her past life\u2026.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">She continued to grind her teeth for no reason when she looked at Silpennon. \u00a0Moreover, she was unusually obsessed with Artpe. \u00a0It was quite scary.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Of course, he had mostly given up on his affections towards her after awakening to his past memories. \u00a0He didn\u2019t plan on pursuing Maetel for her affections. \u00a0However, they had shared camaraderie and friendship in their past lives \u00a0They had shared joys and sorrows for many years. \u00a0He still wanted to be friendly with her. \u00a0He still wanted to be her comrade and friend.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cMaetel.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cWhy are you asking for me, Red?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cNo. \u00a0It is nothing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">It seemed she was tired of calling him redhead, so she had shortened it to Red! \u00a0Silpennon became resigned as he stepped forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cYou taking action is a good plan. \u00a0However, my Innate ability is quite helpful in these types of situation. \u00a0Artpe probably sent you guys along with me thinking this task can\u2019t be done with just my ability\u2026. \u00a0Just wait here. \u00a0I\u2019ll steal everything within this headquarters.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cHmm. \u00a0You are overflowing with confidence. \u00a0It suits you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cAh ah. \u00a0Anywhere is cooked now\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Mycenae had some knowledge about the ability that had awakened within Silpennon. \u00a0This was why she had a complicated expression on her face as she mumbled to herself. \u00a0It didn\u2019t take long. \u00a0It goes without saying that Silpennon backed up his big talk by stealing everything from the Anywhere company. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Silpennon\u2019s group finished their work without running into much difficulty. \u00a0The Anywhere company placed all their high priced items in the storehouse within the headquarters. \u00a0They didn\u2019t need to visit multiple locations. \u00a0They just had to loot one place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Above all else, Silpennon\u2019s Innate ability allowed them to smoothly finish their work from beginning to end.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">The problem was looting Might and Seros. \u00a0Unlike the Anywhere company, the location of their headquarters was common knowledge. \u00a0That is why their wealth was stored in multiple locations. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cThese companies possess a spell that can transport their wealth.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">As Regina spoke those words, the party went through the building, which was considered to be at the heart of the Might merchant company. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t as if they were alone. \u00a0They weren\u2019t being bothered, because everyone in the building had been knocked out by Sienna and Elrick\u2019s shield charge.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cThere is a reason why it is risky to use Spatial magic. \u00a0It leaves behind a Record. \u00a0It allows others to track you down.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cThat sounds very complicated, but I think I get the gist of it. \u00a0You are saying that Records have been left behind if the items passed through the headquarters?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cRight. \u00a0The items that are considered to be extremely valuable are brought to the headquarters first,. \u00a0They measure the value of the items. \u00a0Afterwards, the items are transferred to various branches depending on their worth, volume and type of items.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Regina\u2019s knowledge was very thorough. \u00a0The Might company previously had their headquarters located in a city within the former magic kingdom of Aedia. \u00a0Regina was the secret weapon developed by Aedia, so she had investigated about the Might company over the long years.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cThat means we can use these Records to go to the other branches!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cNope.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Sienna had used her head to come up with an answer, but Regina firmly shook her head in disagreement. \u00a0Sienna tilted her head in confusion. \u00a0Regina raised her staff as she emitted magical energy. \u00a0If other magicians heard her words, they would have let out a shout of disbelief.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cI\u2019m not going to them. \u00a0I\u2019ll activate the Record to call them back.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7call back the Artifacts and Magic Stones?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cYes. I\u2019m not just using Spatial magic. \u00a0I\u2019m reading the Mana pattern of the Artifacts. \u00a0I can read their current location, and I\u2019ll rewind their Record.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cOk. \u00a0I have no idea what you are saying!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Sienna replied with a bright smile. \u00a0Regina lightly tapped Sienna\u2019s head with her staff. \u00a0Instead of elaborating further, Regina activated her magic. \u00a0She had acquired the Record of the Winter Queen. \u00a0She used a magic that only she could yse. \u00a0She was able to see the Records related to Mana with her strengthened eyes. \u00a0She used a summoning spell.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">A frightening wave of Mana immediately arose from her. \u00a0It broke apart the building\u2019s roof. \u00a0As the light of the stars illuminated her, Regina started to summon the items by ones and twos!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cWow! \u00a0It is still coming out!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cSienna, what are you doing? \u00a0You should gather the items.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cHowever, I sense living beings\u2026.. \u00a0 Ah! \u00a0I see! \u00a0It isn't just Artifacts and Magic Stones. \u00a0I think people are being summoned too?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">A merchant had appeared alongside an Artifact. \u00a0The merchant had a death-grip on the Artifact. \u00a0Sienna lightly bashed the merchant with her shield. \u00a0The merchant was sent flying over the roof. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Regina calmly spoke about what was going on.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cIf one wants to interfere with a summon magic, one needs to be in direct contact with the subject being summoned. \u00a0Mana can be injected into the subject to stop the summoning. \u00a0If one fails, one gets summoned alongside the subject.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cAh! \u00a0Over there!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Sienna let out an innocent laughter as she ruthlessly swung her shield. \u00a0The merchants fainted when they were hit with the shield. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t just the custodians of each branches being summoned. \u00a0Dungeon Merchants that possessed Artifacts and Magic Stones started to appear by ones and twos.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cT...this place is...!?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cThis makes no sense. \u00a0I couldn\u2019t even put up a fight with my Mana before being summoned\u2026. \u00a0Kah-hoohk!?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">The merchants tried to put up a decent fight, but Regina\u2019s summon magic was too powerful. \u00a0One had to be at least level 300 to be able to interfere with the Mana pattern she wove. \u00a0Aside from Artpe\u2019s party and Silpennon\u2019s party, there were no other humans that had exceeded level 300.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cIt is endless. \u00a0Tsk. \u00a0These dirty bastards are trying to make money while humans are currently dying on the front-line. \u00a0They squirreled away all these items\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cIt is understandable. \u00a0They just think differently from us.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Sienna quietly spoke her words as she swung her shield. \u00a0The Dungeon Merchants, who had just been summoned, were starting to unsheathe their weapons. \u00a0However, they all fainted when their heads were bashed in by the corner of Sienna\u2019s shield.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cHowever, oppa\u2019s will was just stronger than theirs.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cIt becomes complicated when you start talking about might makes right\u2026. \u00a0However, Artpe is \u00a0absolute in your eyes, so I won\u2019t waste time arguing with you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">In this venture, Elrick also thought Artpe was in the right. \u00a0The human realm was in danger of falling, yet the companies were squirreling away so much resources. \u00a0This meant they were preparing for the human realm\u2019s loss. \u00a0They were preparing for the day when the Demon King \u00a0conquers the whole world.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">The humans were already at a clear disadvantage. \u00a0It might have been understandable if the companies had pulled back their resources later on, so they could fund a resistance. \u00a0However, they were keeping these resources back while the battle between the two sides were close. \u00a0It was obvious as to what they were trying to pull.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cRei, how much more do you have to summon?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cThe Might company has a lot of stuff. \u00a0I\u2019m also going to summon all their Dungeon Merchants, so I think it\u2019ll take 5 more hours.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cFive hours\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 Yes, let\u2019s finish this quickly, so we can return.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cAgreed.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">While Regina was maintaining her summon magic, she extended her Mana towards a different direction. \u00a0There was a communication system used by the Might company, and it extended across the territory of Aedia. \u00a0She made it so that the merchants couldn\u2019t communicate with each other. \u00a0She had activated a wide scale communication interference magic. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cI don\u2019t have enough energy to be surprised any more.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cI wonder what\u2019s happening on Etna unni\u2019s side. \u00a0Do you think everything is going smoothly?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

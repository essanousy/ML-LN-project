She was jealous of the crown prince, who was rolling around on the ground. \u00a0He actually looked favorably on the female knight for her sentiment, so he gave a friendly reply.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYour understanding of this matter is fundamentally wrong. \u00a0That Slime started eating its brethren, because it feared Silpennon. \u00a0At that point, Silpennon had pulled the aggro of that Slime, and he probably inflicted some damage too. \u00a0This is the reason why it counted as Silpennon contributing to the battle.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt isn\u2019t much of a contribution!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Leseti was acting as if she was dissatisfied about Silpennon\u2019s growth. \u00a0Sipennon bellowed from the ground as he sacrificed his clothes by wiping the dust of the floor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGgoo-ahhhhh!

Anyways, Artpe, some change is occurring over there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Silpennon was slowly getting a sense of who he should trust, and who he should ignore. \u00a0He pointed towards the middle of the destroyed plaza of the Dungeon where a light was emanating. \u00a0He called after Artpe when he saw it. \u00a0Artpe had a good idea what Silpennon was feeling, so he smirked as he gave a reply.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDungeons are a place where one could plunder a lot of goods. \u00a0This happens when one clears a floor of a Dungeon or when one does a perfect clear. \u00a0The Dungeon Merchants, who has a contract with the Dungeons, will show up. \u00a0Their goal is to obtain the goods.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs it a form of summoning magic?

put on her business smile as she replied with a firm voice. \u00a0Silpennon was a bit frightened by her, so he took couple steps back. \u00a0At the same time, Artpe supplemented his words with an

String. \u00a0He swung it, and it shattered the observation magic that was about to used secretly on Silpennon and Leseti. \u00a0She mumbled to herself as she grinded her teeth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI never expected you to be able to sense and interfere with observation magic that wasn\u2019t directed at you\u2026.. \u00a0Still, I was able to learn more about your peerless ability, so I didn\u2019t take a loss!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHowever, you\u2019ll be taking a loss from now on. \u00a0I want 30%

point, it was fair to wonder if she enjoyed being taken advantage of by Artpe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was as if Silpennon had passed a baton off to Mycenae. \u00a0She looked as if she wanted to roll around on the floor. \u00a0Artpe ignored Mycenae. \u00a0He started looting the Huge Slime with Maetel.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The first thing he picked up was the precious Demite\u2019s Gemstone. \u00a0The Huge Slime\u2019s ability was beyond expectation. \u00a0One could see that some parts of the hard gem were melted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet\u2019s see\u2026.. \u00a0Oh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe poured water over it to wash away the slime. \u00a0He had a satisfied expression as he looked at the Delmite\u2019s Gemstone, which was letting out more light than before. \u00a0He mumbled to himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf 50 more Huge Slimes shows up, I think I\u2019ll be able to refine it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou want to create 50 more of this monster!?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUnfortunately, it is impossible to do so, so don\u2019t be frightened. \u00a0It is rare to find an opportunity that allows one to easily level up like this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEasily\u2026....\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had also regurgitated all the treasures it ate coming down to this floor. \u00a0It also produced Artifacts and gold coins when the Records and Mana of the Slime was consolidated. \u00a0When Maetel saw one of the items, she let out a happy shout.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s a Skill Book!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUnfortunately, the two of us already learned that one.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skill Book was called Mana Control. \u00a0It was a Skill that could be learned after Mana Detection. \u00a0It was a Skill everyone, who aspired to be a level 100 high rank Class, must learn.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, it was very difficult to learn it by oneself. \u00a0It was hard even for those that were born with the potential for becoming a magician. \u00a0Since the skill can\u2019t be self-taught, one had to buy it with money. \u00a0There were a lot of cases where people gave up on becoming a level 100 high rank Class, because they couldn\u2019t acquire the book.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel had learned such a skill at level 2. \u00a0It really highlighted how bad of a cheat her talent was. \u00a0Nothing more had to be said about that subject.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSince we already learned this Skill, we\u2019ll merely increase our Mana by a little bit if we use it\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">That wasn\u2019t a bad option, but in many ways, it would be best to just sell the Skill Book. \u00a0The demand for the Mana Control Skill was high, yet there was an absolute shortage in supply. \u00a0It was the number one in demand amongst the high rank Skills.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Basically, it was expensive. \u00a0It was very expensive.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat is why at this point\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe looked at Silpennon, who was looking at him with an absent minded face. \u00a0Artpe knew Silpennon had no knowledge of it, yet he asked in a sly manner. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you know what Mana Control

only able to buy it easily, because I had the backing of the throne.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Mycenae and Leseti intruded at the right time to back up Artpe\u2019s words! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Despite their words, Silpennon graoned. \u00a0He mulled over it before he shook his head from side to side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll

yelled out to halt the deal. \u00a0Artpe and Mycenae grinned at the same time, and they turned to look at him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy? \u00a0Did you change your

times when they growled at each other never existed. \u00a0When they were trying to screw over someone else, the two of them worked in absolute harmony! \u00a0Silpennon grinded his teeth as he yelled out his words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll kill you all someday! \u00a0However, I\u2019ll buy that! \u00a0Since I am one of your party members, I expect a

coins from his Dimensional Pouch, and he let out a sigh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Mycenae felt sympathy for him, but she knew Silpennon had sealed his defeat when he tried to go against

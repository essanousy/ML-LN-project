She was unpretentious, and she told the truth. \u00a0For a brief moment, Artpe wondered if Aria would become a much better holy priestess than Vadinet. \u00a0It was as if Vadinet had somehow caught wind of his thoughts. \u00a0She whipped her head around towards him. \u00a0 He was sure of it now. \u00a0Maetel\u2019s ability of being able to read his thoughts was being shared between the girls.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWe\u2019ve arrived.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis is quite the sight.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Since the Demon King had died, the Demons were no longer subject to the Absolute Control. \u00a0 The absence of the Demon King had caused confusion, and the Demons started a meticulous search operation where they searched for the being that had killed the Demon King.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThey have this much loyalty towards the Demon King\u2026..?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo. \u00a0It isn\u2019t loyalty. \u00a0They are just afraid of culprit that had killed the Demon King. \u00a0They are afraid of being killed if they are on their own, so they are traveling in groups. \u00a0If their joint efforts isn\u2019t enough to defeat their foe, they\u2019ll quickly lower their heads.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThey really are acting like extras.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>These were beings that hadn\u2019t been able to live their own lives. \u00a0Rhere had always been a restriction on what they could do. \u00a0They had lived under the rule of the Demon King for their whole lives. \u00a0From their perspective, they valued their lives the most. \u00a0It was the only commodity that they could call their own.</span></p><br/><p><span>However, that would change soon. \u00a0Battle, blood and death had always been the final destination of a Demon\u2019s life, but that would have to change now. \u00a0In the beginning, Artpe had only wanted to turn Etna into a human. \u00a0However, Artpe had reached this point, and he wondered if this might have been his goal all along.</span></p><br/><p><span>Yes, Vadinet was right. \u00a0Artpe was the first Demon to be turned back into a human. \u00a0At the same time, he was a pioneer that will lead other Demons down the road to humanification.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019ll be using the spell soon. \u00a0There will be Demons that\u2019ll try to stop the process. \u00a0Even if they\u2019ll soon be turned into humans, we can\u2019t hesitate. \u00a0We have to kill them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was unknown as to how many of these Demons were affiliated with the previous Demon King\u2019s forces. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>An argument could be made that they should go easy on the Demons since they were going to be turned back into humans. \u00a0However, one would fail miserably if one held such pitiful sentiments.</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe\u2019s words didn\u2019t allow his party members to feel any sentimental emotions. \u00a0Everyone nodded their heads as they hardened their resolve.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAlright. \u00a0Let\u2019s start.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe briefly took a deep breath, and he opened his magic tome. \u00a0His staff and magic tome resonated with each other as they rose into the sky. \u00a0This was obvious, but Aria had reached the limit of her Assimilation ability. \u00a0This was why the party was revealed, while floating in the air.</span></p><br/><p><span>[Humans!]</span></p><br/><p><span>[T...the energy is digging into my skin\u2026. \u00a0Holy power! \u00a0He has holy power!]</span></p><br/><p><span>It wasn\u2019t simple holy power. \u00a0Artpe let out an evil smile as he earnestly unleashed his magic.</span></p><br/><p><span>The Reclamation magic didn\u2019t discriminate between Demons and Demonic energy. \u00a0It was a spell that restored everything that was twisted and out of place! \u00a0Artpe used his staff to boost his Mana, and his Mana flowed into the magic tome. \u00a0It spread into the twisted world called the Demon realm.</span></p><br/><p><span>In a flash, he took out an Artifact from his Dimensional Pouch, and it was consumed. \u00a0It took mere seconds to change Demons into humans in the nearby region.</span></p><br/><p><span>[What\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7!]</span></p><br/><p><span>[S...stop. \u00a0That human bastard is trying to\u2026...]</span></p><br/><p><span>[What the hell? \u00a0Why are the humans\u2026...?]</span></p><br/><p><span>A high number of Demons had no idea what was going on. \u00a0However, some Demons realized that they were being turned into humans. \u00a0This was being done by the hero\u2019s party. \u00a0Some Demons had a dim idea as to what the implications was for this new development.</span></p><br/><p><span>[Don\u2019t panic! \u00a0We cannot win against them in the first place. \u00a0Moreover, they are making us into humans! \u00a0Humans! \u00a0We are becoming humans!]</span></p><br/><p><span>[I can sense my existence being twisted. \u00a0For some reason\u2026.. Somehow, I feel my emotions calming down.]</span></p><br/><p><span>[Shit. \u00a0Retreat! \u00a0Retreat! \u00a0We\u2019ll just die if we fight them! \u00a0They aren\u2019t attacking us, but they are turning us into humans!]</span></p><br/><p><span>The Demons were confused, and they couldn\u2019t rashly attack Artpe\u2019s party. \u00a0In fact, a fight broke out between the Demons that picked up on the situation and the Demons that were too slow to realize what was going on.</span></p><br/><p><span>Tens of thousands of Demons were gathered at the site of the Demon King's castle. \u00a0While an absolute pandemonium broke out between the Demons, Artpe\u2019s party was successful in perfecting the magic circle.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cArtpe, you have to speed it up!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is easy for you to say!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>However, it really was that easy for him. \u00a0Artpe didn\u2019t hesitate to use the Artifacts and Magic Stones he had prepared in his Dimensional Pouch. \u00a0He scattered them all over the place. \u00a0As soon as the items were released into the air, they perished. \u00a0All the Mana was sucked into the magic tome.</span></p><br/><p><span>The site of the Demon King\u2019s castle was colored in gray and red. \u00a0It had been filled with death and blood. \u00a0In the next moment, the place regained its natural colors. \u00a0As if breathing, the Demonic energy within this space was being pushed out.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe land\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 My god\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis really is its original form. \u00a0Look over there. \u00a0The red clouds are dissipating.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is too beautiful. \u00a0I never expected to see such a sight within the Demon realm\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>At the same time, it was an extremely sad sight. \u00a0The ones that were still Demons looked at the Demons that had shed their Demonhood. \u00a0In the end, a fight broke out. \u00a0Then there was the land of the Demon realm, and land that was reverted back to its original form. \u00a0They started to adversely affect each other as they started to become diseased.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhy are they fighting?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThey aren\u2019t aware of our presence\u2026.. \u00a0 No, they are refusing to acknowledge our presence. \u00a0They gave up on understanding our actions, and they aren\u2019t trying to stop us. \u00a0This also means that they need an outlet for their frustration.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s the worst.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe opened up another Dimensional Pouch. \u00a0At once, he expanded the range of his Reclamation magic. \u00a0Everything within his sight turned back into the natural world. \u00a0It was the same for the Demons within it.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGood. \u00a0They have no reason to fight any more.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis isn\u2019t merely a problem between the Demons and the humans, Artpe-nim. \u00a0This might sound evil, but\u2026. \u00a0 If I\u2019m being truthful, this is quite entertaining.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The Demon race had no real reason to fight. \u00a0They fought and killed, because they were alive. \u00a0They killed others, because they were ordered to kill others. \u00a0They had lost their ruler, who had given them orders. \u00a0Now they were losing their Demonhood. \u00a0They were confused. \u00a0They fought against each other, but they were lost. \u00a0In the end, they sat on the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span>There was a good amount of blood shed, and some were trying to run away. \u00a0If they kept their distance, Artpe\u2019s party left them alone.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cShall we move to a different location?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo. \u00a0When the ones that we really have to worry about shows up, these people will become a wall for us.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI had no idea where Artpe-nim\u2019s cheapness comes from. \u00a0It isn\u2019t a character trait of a hero. \u00a0It seems it arose from the experience you had in your past life! \u00a0As expected, you are awesome!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHey. \u00a0That sounded like an insult.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt isn\u2019t!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He kept expanding his spell. \u00a0It really was unbelievable that the Demon King\u2019s castle had existed here. \u00a0The dense Demonic energy was transformed into Mana, and it helped Artpe\u2019s party regain their full power.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what happens after this. \u00a0We\u2019ve already weakened the Demon race with this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Artpe, I can feel them coming. \u00a0I can feel it. \u00a0Soon!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>At that moment, Maetel gathered all the purified Mana at the tip of her sword, and she shot it into her surrounding. \u00a0She didn\u2019t give any consideration to the Demons that were turned into humans. \u00a0The violent attack blew up the entire region.</span></p><br/><p><span>Afterwards, a clearly different group of Demons had appeared. \u00a0They possessed a different type of aggressive Demonic energy. \u00a0They numbered in the several hundreds, and each of them looked extremely pissed. \u00a0It was as if Artpe had spit on the food they had been eating.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKill them all!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUnderstood!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>As expected of a former Four Heavenly King, Artpe immediately ordered an attack whenever a a stranger was located. \u00a0The party quickly attacked the stranger! \u00a0There was no mercy when one was determined to be their enemy!</span></p><br/><p><span>Maetel and the other party members reacted immediately as they attacked the Demons that were over level 300. \u00a0Half the Demons lost their lives instantly, and the rest froze in place. \u00a0They were taken aback by the might of the hero\u2019s party. \u00a0While they were frozen in place, they were turned back into humans through the Reclamation magic.</span></p><br/><p><span>[We have to stop them! \u00a0We are about to attain our long cherished desire, and they are trying to interfere with us!]</span></p><br/><p><span>[He have to stop them until our master can get here. \u00a0The magic\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7!]</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The Reclamation magic couldn\u2019t be stopped unless the previous Demon King took the matter into his own hands. \u00a0This was the first time Artpe was using this magic at this scale, and he had a hard time initiating it. \u00a0However, it became easier once he safely manifested the magic. \u00a0He just had to be the source that provided the spell with continuous Mana. \u00a0It allowed the influence of the spell to grow as its Record grew.</span></p><br/><p><span>The Reclamation magic, which had been manifested by Artpe, was going through that process. \u00a0A Reclamation magic of this magnitude had never existed in the past. \u00a0If one wanted to stop it, one had to kill Artpe, or the magic tome had to be destroyed. \u00a0Those were the only two options.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSoon, they\u2019ll attack me. \u00a0It might be one of them, the previous Demon King or\u2026...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>[Die.]</span></p><br/><p><span>Before Artpe could end his words, someone had come straight for his heart. \u00a0Sienna\u2019s reaction speed was too fast. \u00a0The attack couldn\u2019t get past her. \u00a0 The attack was stopped in the middle.</span></p><br/><p><span>[I never expected you humans to start this before us\u2026. \u00a0Moreover, it was done by someone who used to be a Demon.]</span></p><br/><p><span>The one, who had attacked Artpe, revealed himself. \u00a0A spear made out of black metal had failed to pierce through Sienna\u2019s shield. \u00a0It was stuck in the middle of the shield. \u00a0A level 401 Demon appeared a beat later, and he was holding onto the spear. \u00a0He was a Demon that Artpe hadn\u2019t seen in his past life.</span></p><br/><p><span>[It is time. \u00a0Everything our master wants has been gathered here. \u00a0We\u2019ll take everything you have, and we will greet our master with it.]</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis guy isn\u2019t that high level! \u00a0Just focus your attacks on him. \u00a0Kill him!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>[What\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u00a0Kuh-huhk!?]</span></p><br/><p><span>The Demon had overlooked one thing. \u00a0Artpe\u2019s party didn\u2019t know everything about the previous Demon King\u2019s plan, but at the same time, the previous Demon King\u2019s faction didn\u2019t know about the rapid growth of Artpe\u2019s party. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>The price for such a mistake was his death.</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe\u2019s party didn\u2019t know this, but this was the moment when the last Four Heavenly King in the previous Demon King\u2019s force perished.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

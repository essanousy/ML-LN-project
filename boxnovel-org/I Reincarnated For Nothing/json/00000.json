The hero was the Demon King army's ultimate enemy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShe really is here. \u00a0The Demon King on borrowed time now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The hero had appeared around three years ago, yet she was already here. \u00a0Who would have expected that?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe couldn't smack himself in the back of the head for having such a thought.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Still, he was a bit relieved. \u00a0She was here much earlier than expected. \u00a0There was no way the hero would be able to win against the Demon king.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe problem is my troops will be the first to face them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maybe a Demon King's mind was reshaped when the successor puts on the crown. \u00a0The crazy Demon King had a terrible personality, and he always sent the weakest amongst the Demon race to fight the hero first.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This strong-willed hero was able to rapidly grow for the past 3 years, because the weakest demons were sent first. \u00a0Then the degree of difficulty was slowly increased as the troops failed. \u00a0If the Demon King wasn't a lord, Artpe would have smacked him in the back of the head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, Artpe was moving, and the reason behind his action was obvious. \u00a0The weakest force in the Demon King's castle was his force, and he was their commander. No one from the Demon King's castle would lift a finger until every single one of them were killed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe decided to look on the bright side. \u00a0He was one of the Four Heavenly Kings. \u00a0Would he really be killed by a new hero? \u00a0The last time he checked on her level was about an year ago, and the hero had been level 200. \u00a0She might have grown a little bit, but she wouldn't even be able to scratch the Demon King's castle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet's check her out first.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the ability that allowed Artpe to reach his command post. \u00a0He activated the Read All Creation'. \u00a0It was as the words implied. \u00a0It was an ability that allowed him to find out information about anything that exists in this world. \u00a0His innate ability was one of the reason why the Demon King kept Artpe by his side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had trained his ability through the years, so he was able to successfully activate his ability from a long distance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Several lines appeared in front of his eyes. \u00a0It was written in the language of the Demon Clan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Name - Maetel]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Race : Human Female]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Title : Hero]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe was at a loss for words. \u00a0He had known the female hero was a commoner, and her name was Maetel. \u00a0However, he lost the ability to speak when he read the last line.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Level : 374]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat should we do, commander?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He couldn't even hear the question asked by his subordinate, who stood by his side. \u00a0Artpe's mind was in a confused state.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What? \u00a0374? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he checked up on her only a year ago, he was sure she was only level 200! \u00a0The Demon King had just reached level 400!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey. \u00a0Did we do something to the humans recently?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What caused the worm to become a dragon?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Demon King wanted spice things up a little bit, so he personally dispatched several armies to where the hero lived. \u00a0Now that I think about it, I heard no news of their return.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh-ha. \u00a0He wanted to spice things up a little bit? \u00a0Kyah. \u00a0I didn't know about that!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He marinated her so perfectly that a hero appeared as a full course meal! \u00a0That son of a bitch! \u00a0I should just call him a chef instead of a Demon King!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe's subordinate looked at Artpe's stormy expression, and he immediately grasped the situation. His subordinate made a sour face as he asked Artpe a question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShould we run away, commander?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYeah. Now I want to run away too.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was beating a dead horse, but Artpe was the weak. \u00a0\u00a0However, in the end, he was still one of the Four Heavenly Kings. \u00a0He was level 350, and he had considerable amount of skills. \u00a0However, this was also why he knew what the disparity between him and the hero meant.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even a single level difference meant one's soul was outclassed. \u00a0It was impossible to beat the other unless one had a really good Skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What would happen if there was a difference of 24 levels? \u00a0Even if he gathered all his soul to oppose the hero, he would be destroyed by a single move.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe really wanted to run away. \u00a0He wanted to crawl through the doghole made by the hero. \u00a0How great would it be if he could run away to a place where a being from the Demon race wouldn't be recognized? \u00a0He wanted to go to a peaceful place where fighting and war didn't exist. \u00a0How great would it be if he could just live as he raised some cows!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKoo-ooh-ooh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he had that thought, a red choker appeared on his smooth neck, and it ruthlessly tightened around his neck. \u00a0It put pressure on his body and mind. \u00a0He was owned by another. \u00a0The Demon King's Innate Ability called Absolute Control was activated.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When one was defeated by the Demon King, the Demon King\u2019s Innate Ability activated to control his opponent. \u00a0Once his innate ability took hold, it was impossible to escape from it. \u00a0One had to follow all his orders, and if one held thoughts that ran contrary to his orders, one\u2019s neck would be choked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When that happens, death was the final outcome. \u00a0One had to turn back into a docile sheep to follow his order, or one could just choose to die. \u00a0Artpe had to select one of the two choices right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe wanted to live a little bit more, so he chose the former option. \u00a0The choking sensation around his neck quickly disappeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCommander.....\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt's all right. \u00a0Don't say anything.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were several times in the past when he felt the sensation of being choked to death. \u00a0It was akin to what happened a moment ago. \u00a0On such occasions, Artpe struggled to live by not resisting against the orders of the Demon King. \u00a0This was why he was able to stay alive until now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had experienced scenes of violence until he was fed of with it. \u00a0He wouldn't be broken by a mere hero.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, it was also clear that he would lose for sure if events continued along down this path. \u00a0Artpe thought hard on how he'll be able to survive this. \u00a0In the end, he chose the last resort. \u00a0He hadn't wanted to choose this option.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7please go contact Etna-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was the only woman amongst the Four Heavenly Kings. \u00a0She was the leader of the Army of Thieves. \u00a0Her name was Etna Carlyfate Mirecard. \u00a0She was ranked second in Four Heavenly King\u2019s ranking. \u00a0However, the most important part was that she was in love with Artpe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTell her I'll agree to the Soul Pact if she helps me. \u00a0She'll come here after she gets permission from the Demon King.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Soul Pact was the absolute contract of amity that could be made amongst two Demons. \u00a0Basically, it signified marriage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c....do you really want to marry her? \u00a0You still won't be able to die a natural death.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCan't you see I'm about to die right now? \u00a0You really want to argue about this right now? \u00a0Are you trying to pick a fight with me? \u00a0Do you want to die before me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Artpe browbeat him, his underling quickly ran into the castle. \u00a0He let out a sigh at this sight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Etna was a beautiful and powerful woman. Even amongst the Demon race, who was famous for being ill tempered, she clearly possessed a pure nature. \u00a0This was why she was popular amongst her subordinates. \u00a0A woman of such caliber liked him. \u00a0This was a big blessing for him even if she wasn't his type.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">So why did Artpe turn down her proposal until now? \u00a0The man, who was ranked 1st amongst the Four Heavenly Kings, was in love with Etna. \u00a0Artpe didn't want to make enemy of this man, so he had turned down her offer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he couldn't worry about making a future enemy right now. \u00a0The hero\u2019s party was coming towards him, and they were too scary for him to worry about the implications of his action.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ah, they were already running amuck.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His two eyes clearly saw the sight of his Enforcement army being crushed in a distressing manner. \u00a0It was true. \u00a0He was really afraid.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Please come before it is too late! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Please allow Etna to participate in the battle, Demon King! \u00a0If you leave them be like this, you will also be in danger! \u00a0Please allow her to participate in this, Sheff!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease don't cause any trouble, and surrender to us, Four Heavenly King Artpe Hirtana Kelduke. \u00a0There is no need for us to fight each other any longer.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was all too late. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Fuck this demonic life of his...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe looked at the innocent looking girl, who was the hero. \u00a0She had her sword pointed towards his neck, and she had a slightly sorrowful expression on her face. \u00a0He let out a hollow laugh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou make it sound as the Demon King's army isn\u2019t on a campaign to bring about world peace.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She probably didn't know about the existence of the shackles that bound all demons under the Demon King's service. \u00a0Even if he didn't want to fight, he had to force himself to fight. \u00a0He didn't like killing humans, yet he had to force himself to kill them. \u00a0She probably didn't even know such a demon existed within the Demon race.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If she found out about the truth, this kind girl would probably be unable to swing her sword against them. \u00a0However, Artpe decided not to tell her anything. \u00a0Since things had progressed this far, he thought it might be better if she was able to kill the Demon King once and for all.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStill, the others around you seems better equipped for this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a magician, a warrior equipped with a shield and a sharp-eyed thief with a dagger. \u00a0If Artpe said or did anything funny, they would kill him without giving him any quarter.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They knew the truth behind the Demon race, yet they still decided to walk the road of carnage. \u00a0They were true heroes, and Artpe admired them. \u00a0They were qualified to be by the side of this heroine.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHero. I'm pretty sure a very good looking noonim will be coming here soon, and she'll be very angry when she sees my corpse. \u00a0I want you to give her this message.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe's weird and offbeat words were taken as being a start of some kind of ploy by the thief. \u00a0The thief moved immediately. He was incredibly fast. \u00a0He might be faster than the hero.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was understandable. \u00a0There was no burning animosity shown towards the hero by Artpe, and it seemed she would need a good amount of time before she could bring herself to apply the final blow to him. \u00a0Her impatient comrade had stepped forward to try to kill him in her stead. \u00a0Artpe had expected such a move.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIn truth, I.... \u00a0Kuh-huhk!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The thief's dagger pierced through Artpe's heart. The blade was sharper and deadlier than the ugly past of his childhood. It had shredded his heart, but Artpe didn't die immediately.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIn truth, I'm not too fond of older women... \u00a0Kahk. \u00a0Please tell her...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW...what the hell are you talking about? \u00a0Why are you saying such strange words! \u00a0This makes you... \u00a0It makes you seem like a normal person....!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The hero had a sad expression on her face. \u00a0It was as if she was about to cry. \u00a0When Artpe faced her pure sadness, he felt better. \u00a0He grinned. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, he would die, but his tedious life would come to an end.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he was born again, he wanted to be born in a place where he was free of that damn Demon King.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe gave a heartfelt prayer as he closed his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Before he died, he heard the angry shout of a woman, but he didn't care. \u00a0He was about to die, so it was none of his business.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was how Artpe Hirtana Kelduke died. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was one of the Four Heavenly Kings in the Demon King army, but his death was miserable. \u00a0It held no weight. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In his last moments, he could see two lines of words etched into his retina. \u00a0However, his consciousness was already fading into death.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Innate Ability Read All Creation has evolved.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Secret Option Rewrite is Activated.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he opened his eyes again, he was in the form of a small male child.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Didn't a thief ruthlessly stab a dagger into his heart a moment ago? \u00a0Artpe was having a hard time getting used to his rapidly changed situation. \u00a0He looked around his surrounding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a very small and worn down hut. \u00a0The window up top was letting in sunlight, and the light illuminated a cloud of dust. This looked like a place where humans would live. \u00a0Now that he thought about it, it seemed he had taken the form of a male human child!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Is this Illusion Magic?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, this thought lasted only for a brief moment. \u00a0His soul held his Innate Ability called Read All Creation. \u00a0It allowed him to pierce through all lies. \u00a0It showed him only the truth. \u00a0This was why he was sure he wasn\u2019t under any Illusion magic.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Mirror. \u00a0I have to find a mirror. \u00a0I have to assess what kind of situation I am in.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His ability, Read All Creation, was an incredible power. \u00a0However, if he wanted to Read himself, he needed a reflective surface to see himself. \u00a0It didn\u2019t matter if the reflection came in form of a puddle, mirror or even a person\u2019s eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He searched the small and dirty hut, but he couldn't find a mirror. \u00a0In the end, he was successfully in finding a bowl on top of the kitchen table. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He poured enough water into the bowl, and he could see a \u00a0blurred image of himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7it is me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had black hair and purple colored eyes. \u00a0He had white enough skin to be called pale. \u00a0It had been a long time ago, but his face was identical to the face he had when he was a very young Demon. \u00a0It was indisputable. \u00a0Artpe was himself, but at the same time, it was indisputable that he was a human.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe was still in the midst of despairing when his Innate Ability Read All Creation delivered the final blow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Name - Artpe]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Race : Human Male]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Level : 1]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Strength : 3, Agility : 2, Stamina : 2, Magic Energy : 19]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Innate Ability : Read All Creation(Step 2)]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His name, race and level were all too shocking! \u00a0If there was a god, he wanted to kill the bastard! \u00a0He\u2019ll kill the god alongside the Demon King!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7huh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soon, Artpe realized the most shocking part was still left for him to be discovered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Innate Ability : Read All Creation(Step 2)]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His Read All Creation was now on Step 2?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018When did the Innate Ability develop stages?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It happened when Artpe was thinking over this question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The door to the hut opened, and a human ran in from outside.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet's play, Artpe!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The one, who spoke, was a beautiful human girl.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had such beautiful golden hair that it was almost unbelievable that a commoner had such hair.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Her emerald colored eyes were bright and passionate. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead of the rag she was wearing, a silk dress would have gone better with her white skin and well-formed feature.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHero?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe was so taken aback that he mumbled to himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Somehow, the hero heard his words. \u00a0\u00a0Maetel let out a bright laugh as she replied.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. \u00a0Let's go play being heroes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the day when Artpe died as a demon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was reborn as a 12 year old male human, who was the childhood friend of the hero.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

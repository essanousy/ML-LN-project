Fortunately, it was late spring, so the weather was mild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMmm. \u00a0We are quite noticeable. \u00a0That\u2019s great..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIsn\u2019t it bad if we are noticed, Artpe?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel tilted her head in puzzlement as she asked the question. \u00a0Artpe let out a light laugh as he gave an explanation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat only applies when we are exploring a Dungeon where we have no idea if strong enemies are present or not. \u00a0However, we know that there are only level 100 cast offs inside this region. \u00a0This is why it would be more convenient if they scouted and came towards us.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI see!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When their enemies caught sight of the group, they would immediately attack the party. \u00a0In such a scenario, Maetel would be able to cut them down without being repulsed by what she had to do.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe didn\u2019t explain any further as he expanded his Mana Threads into a wide net. \u00a0This wasn\u2019t something like feeling an ominous feeling when one was being watched or ambushed. \u00a0He would be able to know who was going to attack him. \u00a0At the very least, it would allow him to prepare a counterattack.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As he controlled a massive amount of Mana, he directed a question towards the nearby Village Person A.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo which village is closest to this location?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe village doesn\u2019t have an official name\u2026. \u00a0\u00a0If we go past that hill, we\u2019ll be there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The town didn\u2019t have a name. \u00a0These towns were so unimportant that it would probably not be recorded in the hero\u2019s chronicle. \u00a0They went to several of these villages as they gathered more people. \u00a0Moreover, they cleared out all the soldiers and black magicians they encountered\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Quest Reward would continue to bottom out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The thought of it made him sad. \u00a0However, even if the Quest Reward was garbage now, he had to go through it to get to the next stage of this Quest. \u00a0This was the charm of a chained Quest, so he had to endure it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Still, I hope this ends before the summer of this year. \u00a0I want to avoid what always occurs in the fall\u2026...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he went by the schedule, they had plenty of time. \u00a0They would have enough time even if they ran in place going nowhere for four years. \u00a0Even if such delays occurred, Maetel would probably learn skills like Jump and all the techniques associated with it. \u00a0She was scary like that.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The problem right now was the fact that the world and the monsters changed depending on the seasons. \u00a0There were monsters that were calm in the spring, and they would cause trouble in the summer. \u00a0Then there were the monsters that attacked after the fall harvest in the winter. \u00a0They attacked to steal the food of the humans. \u00a0Artpe was trying to proceed on a specific route, and there were those on this route that would be affected by the seasons..</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If Silpennon is able to grow up quickly, I can use him. \u00a0No, it might be faster to develop this one. \u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On one side of him, a lovely white-haired girl was grabbing onto his sleeve like Maetel. \u00a0He smirked as he looked down at her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was skilled enough to control her Mana, and under his tutelage, she was emitting a white colored Mana. \u00a0She was moving it around with one hand. \u00a0Her skill level was better than him in his previous life. \u00a0She had ridiculous amount of potential. \u00a0Why were there only geniuses around him!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The genius pouted as she looked up at Artpe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is tiring, oppa.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMana is nature. \u00a0If you accept nature as being Mana, nature will soon become one with your Mana. \u00a0It will fill you up.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOk. \u00a0I\u2019ll try harder.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Demons possessed overwhelming more Mana compared to humans. \u00a0After consuming Mana, Demons also had a much faster recovery time. \u00a0The reason for this difference was the fact that the Demon race looked at Mana in a fundamentally different way than humans.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No matter how much he explained it, humans were unable to understand the perspective seen by the Demon race. \u00a0There were magicians in historical records that were barely able to understand this truth after many years. \u00a0This foundation allowed them to be able to compete against Demons. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In his past life, the magician from the hero\u2019s party understood this perspective. \u00a0It was thanks to this magician that the Demon race\u2019s strongholds in the human world was all brought down. \u00a0Any Demon that got in her way had died. \u00a0In truth, Artpe was more afraid of the magician than the hero in his previous life.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. \u00a0It quickened a little bit. \u00a0Oppa, it is as if the Mana is smiling at me!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7yes, I see. \u00a0So that\u2019s how it is.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In this life, it seemed there would be at least one more terrifying prodigy that would be on par with that magician.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe wonder why such a monster-like prodigy like Sienna hadn\u2019t made a name for herself in his previous life. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He stroked the head of the girl that was smiling brightly at him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUghhhh, Artpe. \u00a0I....I want to learn Mana\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMaetel, you are already pretty good at handling Mana\u2026...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In short order, they arrived at the first town. \u00a0The town had been in a rut, since they had lost all their children. \u00a0They rejoiced when they saw the safely returned children. \u00a0They also cried for the children that would never make it back to them. \u00a0Then they became shocked at Artpe\u2019s edict to leave their town.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2026.I can\u2019t do this!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOf course, you saved my child, so I\u2019ll give you compensation as thanks. \u00a0However, I can\u2019t abandon the village\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe won\u2019t force you to do this. \u00a0However, if you all continue to live like this, the soldiers will steal your children once again. \u00a0Shall I give you more bad news? \u00a0They won\u2019t hesitate to torture you for information regarding my party. \u00a0They will kill several of you as an

throne.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW...what!?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The people discussed the topic in a heated fashion, and sides were formed. \u00a0The people that lost then recovered their children followed Artpe and Maetel\u2019s lead. \u00a0The rest stayed behind. \u00a0Since the children obediently followed Artpe and Maetel, the townspeople decided to put their trust in them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf the soldiers come asking questions, you guys tell them everything you saw here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span

I\u2019m trying to accomplish. \u00a0It is better than you guys dying just because you hid the information.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span

towards them!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, he didn\u2019t think the soldiers would let the townspeople live even if the townspeople told them everything. \u00a0However, Artpe had given them a fighting chance. \u00a0He had done enough for these idiots who had basically forfeited their lives, because they were afraid of change.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It took several days, but Artpe\u2019s party toured all the nearby villages. \u00a0Most towns reacted similarly to each other, and the people who lost their children showed strong feelings towards Artpe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMy child! \u00a0What happened to my child!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou did it! \u00a0I bet you killed my child!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe understood their rage, so he didn\u2019t get mad. \u00a0Maetel had been restless over the situation, and she had done well holding herself back until now. \u00a0However, her composure broke when she met the parents of the dead children.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t like that. \u00a0When we found the children, they were already\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Maetel.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were unfairly placing the blame on Artpe. \u00a0Maetel had emerged from this tragedy alongside him, so it would have been weird if Maetel wasn\u2019t agitated by the current situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the truth would place the people in more danger. \u00a0If townspeople decided to stay behind, they were told the children were kidnapped, and some had died under unfortunate circumstances.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He left it at that.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI was too late to save them. \u00a0I\u2019m very sorry. \u00a0I have no excuses.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe spoke only those words. Deception and disdain were necessary skills for the Four Heavenly King, but he briefly put away those skills. \u00a0Right now he had to use an essential skill used by swindlers. \u00a0He pushed forward with his version of the story. \u00a0There were omissions, so he wasn\u2019t technically lying.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was enough.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEek. \u00a0Eeeeek\u2026...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKoo-hoohk\u2026.. \u00a0We already know you aren\u2019t at fault. \u00a0However, if we accept that as fact then who should we hate!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoohk\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u00a0My baby\u2026.

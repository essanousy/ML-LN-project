Sienna, where are you!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Aena kept calling out her dongsaeng\u2019s name as she walked amongst the children. \u00a0It seems she wasn\u2019t having any luck

the hearts of Maetel, Aena and Artpe brighten. \u00a0In the midst of the children groaning in pain, they definitely heard a voice that held consciousness!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cArtpe!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a quick catch in her voice as Maetel let out a shout of joy. \u00a0As if he had been waiting for this moment, he started giving her directions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet\u2019s move him out towards the perimeter! \u00a0More and more children will be freed from the hold of the

child. \u00a0She separated the children in the throes of pain, so each child had some room of their own. \u00a0She hugged and stroked the children.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Her heart had been in a heightened state from the rage she felt. \u00a0However, her heart had now calmed down. \u00a0She directed an endless amount of worry and sympathy towards the children. \u00a0When he saw this, Artpe let out a sigh of relief even though he was suffering from a headache.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, ah-ooh-ooh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI...I can see

soon!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As more Mana rushed towards the obsidian, more children gained consciousness as they were freed from the curse. \u00a0It started with one child. \u00a0The number increased to 10, 50\u2026.. \u00a0\u00a0The expressions of the other children started to calm down. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAmazing, Artpe\u2026. \u00a0You are

of her dongsaeng. \u00a0Aena calculated the date when she was captured. \u00a0Her dongsaeng shouldn\u2019t have been amongst the slain monsters\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe firmly bit his lips as he checked the status of the black obsidian. \u00a0The obsidian had darkened to a point where it indicated that it had almost reached its limit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He knew there was a limit to how much it can store, but it had filled up too fast. \u00a0This quest had been much larger in scale than he had expected it to be.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Fortunately, Artpe had prepared for the worst, so he had a contingency plan in his back pocket.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cReinforcement.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the process of smashing through the beginner\u2019s Dungeon with Maetel, he had acquired the Reinforcement skill. \u00a0This wasn\u2019t just a normal reinforcement skill. \u00a0The skill allowed him to improve an Artifact at its foundation. \u00a0In his previous life, Artpe wouldn\u2019t have dare to dream about obtaining such a skill. \u00a0It was a Rank SSS skill!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This skill was in Artpe\u2019s hands right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He could see the structure of all items through his Read All Creation ability, and now he had the Reinforcement skill. \u00a0He could use Reinforcement on specific parts of an item, and it was possible for him to reinforce an item that was supposed to be impossible to reinforce. \u00a0Basically, it was a cheat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was as he surmised. \u00a0It was possible to strengthen the Obsidian of Greed with his Reinforcement skill. \u00a0In a flash, half of Artpe\u2019s enormous reservoir of Mana was consumed by the obsidian. \u00a0The obsidian shone brighter than before, and it had increased in size.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Once again the flow of energy within the space changed. \u00a0\u00a0When the obsidian\u2019s absorption rate was reinforced, the cursed Mana hidden within the body of the children couldn\u2019t resist against the pull of the obsidian. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGgoo-ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt hurts. \u00a0It hurts too much!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Screams of pain erupted from various locations. \u00a0However, the pain was proof that they were alive.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The scream became shouts, and despair turned into joy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe was controlling too much Mana flow, so it felt as if his head was about to burst. \u00a0He ignored the pain as he kept increasing the absorption rate. \u00a0It would be a tragic comedy if monsters were born, because he dawdled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSienna\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7

the children. \u00a0She had been barely able to regain consciousness thanks to Artpe\u2019s power, and she was able to face her unni.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe glanced towards them when he became loss for words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cU...unni.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSienna? \u00a0Sienna, what\u2019s wrong!

didn\u2019t reply to Aena\u2019s heartfelt plea. \u00a0He firmly shut his mouth, but he was able to see the most accurate information regarding the girl named Sienna through his

have to be Aena\u2019s dongsaeng? \u00a0\u00a0It was a most laughable situation he found himself in. \u00a0This story seemed to be tailor-made for a hero\u2019s story. \u00a0It almost made him

\u00a0Her face stiffened when she realized what Sienna was talking about. \u00a0However, she wasn't like Aena who kept calling Artpe\u2019s name. \u00a0She asked Artpe a question with a calm

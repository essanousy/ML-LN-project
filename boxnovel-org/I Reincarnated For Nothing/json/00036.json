\u00a0He was able to assess the number of the nearby enemies and their abilities. \u00a0He was also able to monitor the amount of Mana possessed by the Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His existence made any traps and ambushes irrelevant. \u00a0Moreover, no one could endure more than a single attack from Artpe and Maetel. \u00a0Aena was running without rest, yet she was barely able to keep up with them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThey are strong\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat is the third line in the \u201850 lines that no one survived after saying it\u2019. \u00a0You must have studied it a little bit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe had been running while he kept a hold on Aena\u2019s hand. \u00a0He lightly infused Mana into his dagger. \u00a0The dagger pierced through the throat of a retreating soldier. \u00a0When the soldier fell, the black magician hiding in the back was revealed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cB...blessing of the clandestine darkness\u2026...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoohng.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His opponent revealed his identity as a black magician by chanting a spell. \u00a0However, the dagger planted inside the throat slid out as it rose into the air again. \u00a0It embedded itself into the black magician\u2019s heart.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The black magician had no idea what had happened to him. \u00a0He fell helplessly to the floor as Maetel also took care of the remaining soldiers in a flash. \u00a0\u00a0She mumbled to herself as if she was dumbfounded by what had occurred.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThey are too weak.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you remember me telling you about the Demon world\u2019s greatest chef?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes! \u00a0I want to eat food that was cooked by that demon!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe looked at her with peculiar eyes when she said those words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt seems the Demons are making a once in a lifetime food here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow do you know that? \u00a0There are only bad people here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere is a reason.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If there was a powerful Demon present here, there was a good chance that Artpe and Maetel would suffer a defeat. \u00a0However, this was probably a minor plan, so why would they dispatch a Demon over level 200 here? \u00a0It wasn\u2019t something that was done lightly. \u00a0All the black magicians up until now were humans, and none of them were over level 50.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, the Demon King didn\u2019t just send the weakest first against the hero. \u00a0He sent the weakest amongst his subordinates to do all his tasks. \u00a0This was also true when he dealt with the joint forces.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It somewhat made sense if he planned on only letting the strongest survival regardless if they were allies or not. \u00a0Anyways, no matter how he thought about it, the Demon King was an idiot.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cR...run away\u2026..!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo, we can\u2019t run away.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe....we have to call him\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo, we can\u2019t call him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The weak typically ran away when a strong opponent made an appearance. \u00a0If running away wasn\u2019t an option, they called for reinforcement. \u00a0Of course, it was useless in front of the all-around hero Maetel and the rotten hero Artpe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKoohk!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKah-hahk!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were all killed as soon as they were found, so news didn\u2019t flow towards the inner Dungeon where others were on standby. \u00a0This was why they died saying similar lines or they died before they could even speak.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe planned on making a manuscript that wrote down the most common phrases spoken before death by minor characters. \u00a0His enemies here were faithful in using those repertoire of phrases.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUse the transmission magic!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat isn\u2019t working either.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKahk!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the very least, Artpe was vigilant about their use of transmission magic. \u00a0They didn\u2019t have to be afraid of anyone within the Dungeon, but if an officer of the Demon King\u2019s army could be mobilized, there would be no countermeasure.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, transmission magic was useless in front of his Read All Creation ability and Mana String. \u00a0His opponents couldn\u2019t even use \u00a0a simple magic \u00a0or a curse.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cD...do you guys realize what you\u2019ve just done!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, we already know, so you don\u2019t have to explain it to us.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKuh-huhk!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was as if the soldiers deluded themselves into thinking they were the archduke, and the black magicians put on air as if they had risen to the seat of the Demon King. \u00a0However, they were all killed by Maetel\u2019s sword and Artpe\u2019s dagger before they could utter their threats.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The 1st floor ended in short order, and the 2nd floor also didn\u2019t take too long. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Aena was getting tired as she tried to keep up with them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow... \u00a0Hehk. \u00a0This is\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShhh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When they descended to the 3rd floor, Artpe spread his Mana Threads in all directions. \u00a0He immediately asked for silence from his party members. \u00a0Then his expression crumpled in a rueful manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAs expected of a first Quest\u2026. \u00a0The Dungeon ends at the third floor. \u00a0However\u2026. \u00a0The Quest started a bit too late. \u00a0Tsk.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSometimes Artpe says some very profound words.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe children are here\u2026\u2026.?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The curse present in the atmosphere of the 1st and 2nd floor was bearable for normal people. \u00a0However, it was possible to see the curse with one\u2019s eye on the 3rd floor. \u00a0It looked like a very thick fog.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKoohk, magician-nim. \u00a0It feels as if the air is burning\u2026...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he saw that Aena\u2019s complexion had immediately turn pale, he took out the obsidian as he clicked his tongue. \u00a0It sucked in all the curse residing within the atmospheric Mana.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Aena\u2019s complexion improved a little bit, but the pain she was feeling wouldn\u2019t subside until he could get rid of all the curse in the atmosphere. \u00a0Nevertheless, it was fortunate that he had gotten rid of her curse earlier. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe\u2019ll be running at full speed from now on. \u00a0Aena, you have to run as if your life's on the line. \u00a0Understood?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI...I understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The 3rd floor was unusually quiet. \u00a0There were only three people running across the floor, so small sounds echoed throughout the hallway. \u00a0All the traps were disabled and destroyed . \u00a0The soldiers and black magicians that had shown up on the 1st and 2nd floor every time they had gotten bored weren\u2019t present here. \u00a0The curse on the 3rd floor had been strong enough to be dangerous to them too.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is so quiet that it is making me feel very uneasy. \u00a0Artpe\u2026...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDon\u2019t worry. \u00a0The children aren\u2019t dead yet. \u00a0At the very least, not all of them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe\u2019s words hinted at something. \u00a0It was easy to discern what he was talking about. \u00a0The expression on the faces of Maetel and Aena hardened. \u00a0However, their steps quickened as if they were responding to their emotions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel bravely ran through the Dungeon filled with the curse. \u00a0Artpe tied the Obsidian of Greed to a Mana String, and he rotated it to suck in all the curse. \u00a0He kept storing the curse as he followed her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Aena followed behind them, and tears were already filling her eyes. \u00a0She held a branch in her slender hands. \u00a0She had brought it with her as her weapon, and her heart shook like the branch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They passed one room than another. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel suddenly came to a stop when they went past the 3rd room.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7ooh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWarrior-nim?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoooooh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A groan leaked out of Maetel\u2019s mouth. \u00a0Artpe had seen the information regarding his surrounding with his Read All Creation ability, so he knew why she was reacting that way.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If possible, he hadn\u2019t wanted her to see this sight. \u00a0However, the Obsidian of Greed sucked in all of the fog created by the curse. \u00a0It made the surrounding brighter, so it was impossible to miss it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7they are dead.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel spoke with a trembling voice. \u00a0One could see a dead monster at the corner of the room. \u00a0It had lying in a pool of its blood. \u00a0Artpe kept silent as Aena also caught sight of the monster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The monster had a small body as if it hadn\u2019t fully matured, yet its arms and legs were abnormally long. \u00a0It was wearing tattered human clothes, and it was crusted with dried brown blood.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. \u00a0Ah-ooooh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When she confirmed the other monster corpses, Aena let out an inarticulate moan. \u00a0The monsters weren\u2019t wearing clothes or accessories that would allow her to identify them. \u00a0However, they all looked like her dongsaeng to her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe was able to find out that the children had turned into monsters around 10 days ago using his Read All Creation ability. \u00a0However, he kept that fact to himself. \u00a0All the dead monsters here had been in the same situation as Aena\u2019s dongsaeng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy did they kill them\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat I do not know. \u00a0If their goal was to make children into monsters, they probably wanted them for something. \u00a0They must have had a plan. \u00a0The fact that they killed the children instead of sending them out into the world\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was hard to come up with an explanation. \u00a0If the Demon King\u2019s army wanted to sow confusion in the outside world, they would have sent the monsters out into the world. They had succeeded in applying the curse, yet the monsters were killed? \u00a0It was an idiotic move.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If not, maybe there was a plan that Artpe was unable to discern?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt must have hurt a lot.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While Artpe was going through his thoughts, Matel mumbled to herself in an absent minded manner. \u00a0The monsters had died as they spit out blood, and Maetel couldn\u2019t turn her gaze away from them. \u00a0She kept repeating the same words as if something had broken within her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt must have hurt a lot\u2026. \u00a0It must have hurt a lot\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMaetel.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A red energy started emanating from her body. \u00a0\u00a0It was a sign that her Berserker skill was about to be activated. \u00a0Artpe quickly grabbed her, and the energy was instantly gathered within her. \u00a0The fact that she was able to retract it so easily was scarier than the skill itself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel turned towards Artpe as she made a request.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cArtpe? The children\u2026. \u00a0Please don\u2019t leave any behind\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Artpe extended his hand, the corpses of the dead monsters were incinerated in a flash. \u00a0He had spent a great deal of money learning this magic, yet he had never expected this would be the first place he would use it. \u00a0\u00a0He was dumbfounded at the turn of events.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry, kids\u2026. \u00a0I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t get here sooner.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, ah-oooooh\u2026..hoohk.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel mumbled to herself as she stood still. \u00a0She watched the corpses of the children turn to ash inside the fire. \u00a0Aena couldn\u2019t shake the thought that her dongsaeng might be amongst the dead monsters. \u00a0She wasn\u2019t in her right mind. \u00a0Artpe watched them as he firmly bit his lips.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Maetel\u2019s abilities are amazing, but her mind is too immature. \u00a0If possible, I wanted her to experience such dirty business later on\u2026\u2026 \u00a0Shit.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since the incident had already occurred, nothing could be done about it. \u00a0Artpe wanted to change the mood surrounding Maetel and Aena, so he lightly clapped his hands. \u00a0He drew their attention to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe can mourn for them at a later time. \u00a0We have to move before it is too late.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel firmly nodded her head. \u00a0She glared at the fog created by the curse, and she launched herself forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet\u2019s hurry.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The 3rd floor of the Dungeon was ridiculously long compared to the other floors. \u00a0\u00a0Every time the curse was absorbed the sight of one or two corpses of monsters revealed themselves.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Aena\u2019s body shook every time more corpses were found, but the two heroes didn\u2019t stop. \u00a0The only thing they did was to burn the bodies with flame when they were found.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The only thing that deserved a special mention was Maetel\u2019s status.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Maetel]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Level : 174]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Berserk Lv13]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He knew Maetel hadn\u2019t activated her Berserk skill, but when he checked with his Read All Creation ability, her Berserk skill was progressing in real-time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When she saw the corpses of the monster-turned children being burned to ash, she threw herself further into the fog created by the curse, and a red energy emanated from her. \u00a0It looked as if it would manifest, but Maetel collected it back into herself every time. \u00a0It was as if she was building up her rage as she waited for the moment to release it all at once.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was something that could be seen in Berserkers that had learned to control their emotions over numerous years. \u00a0It was a stage that could be attained after being in countless battles, yet Maetel was showing similar signs to those Berserkers. \u00a0Even Artpe didn\u2019t dare to guess what she was feeling right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI...I\u2019ve already counted over h\u2026.hundred of them, magician-nim. \u00a0What shall we do? \u00a0What can we do?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe scale of this operation is much larger than I expected.

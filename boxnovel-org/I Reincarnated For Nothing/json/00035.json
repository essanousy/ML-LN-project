If an item or a Mana had the property of a curse, it would all be absorbed into the stone. \u00a0However, it was hard to do anything significant when the curse was already active.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A curse wasn\u2019t like placing a load on a person\u2019s shoulder. \u00a0A portion of a person\u2019s skin, bones, muscles, brain and heart went through subtle changes. \u00a0These changes permeated into one\u2019s entire being, and the change would become inextricably linked to one\u2019s body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why if one was rash in extracting the cursed Mana, the innate Mana within the subject would go on a rampage before killing the subject.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf so\u2026. \u00a0Come, Aena. \u00a0I\u2019ll deal with you first.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cY... yes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, such limitations didn\u2019t apply to Artpe, because he possessed a rare cheat ability called the Read All Creation ability!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he concentrated, he could get a detailed information on the composition of plants or creatures. \u00a0So how could extracting cursed Mana from affected regions be difficult for him!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis might hurt a little bit. \u00a0Endure it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW...what? \u00a0What did I do\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEndure it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, hoohk!?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe abruptly placed the Obsidian on Aena\u2019s forehead. \u00a0Afterwards, Aena\u2019s body started to shake. \u00a0The townspeople who had been watching this sight immediately stepped back in fright. \u00a0Of course, Artpe didn\u2019t pay any attention to them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI caught it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was able to pinpoint the part of her weak innate magical energy that was being dyed black with the energy of the curse. \u00a0After a precise extraction, he spoke to her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStill, your erodibility was very low, so you didn\u2019t suffer as much.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cE...erodibility\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Aena was shaking from the pain as she asked him a question. \u00a0She could immediately guess at what had happened, so her eyes opened wide.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yes, she was sure her body hadn\u2019t felt normal. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one felt fine when one was being changed into a monster through a curse, that person would be the incredible one.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMonster...Modification Curse\u2026.? \u00a0Then my dongsaeng and the other children of the town\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe children were rounded up by them, because of that reason. \u00a0Of course, they are also the ones who placed the curse on you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEeeeeeeek.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The girl bit her lips in anger. \u00a0A small smile appeared on Artpe\u2019s lips when he saw this. \u00a0Pain usually transferred into emotion. \u00a0The curse had progressed to a mere 1%, yet for a brief moment when she raged\u2026...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. \u00a0You did very well.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe stepped back when he saw a slightly darker light within the Obsidian. \u00a0He checked her with his Read All Creation ability, and not an ounce of curse energy was left behind. \u00a0Aena blinked her eyes in wonder.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMy body feels light. \u00a0I thought I had merely been tired and hungry\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDid the unrest in your emotions lessen?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7yes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe impishly asked the question when it seemed he already knew the answer. \u00a0Aena slightly nodded her head in confirmation. \u00a0The townspeople who had been behind her started to crowd forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW...will we change into monsters too, magician-nim?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but could you perhaps heal us too\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When it came to their own well-being, they were quick to step forward. \u00a0Artpe let out a bitter laugh as he shook his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou guys are fine. \u00a0It seems the curse was placed on children, who hadn\u2019t matured completely yet. \u00a0So the problem is with your offsprings.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cT...then my daughter\u2026.!?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCurse\u2026.. \u00a0A curse!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine if I\u2019m able to find them quickly. \u00a0You shouldn\u2019t worry about them this early in the process.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had thought this was a simple matter of the soldiers capturing their sons and daughters. \u00a0However, a Modification Curse had been placed on them! \u00a0The complexion of the townspeople immediately darkened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were afraid of the sword carrying soldiers. \u00a0However, they were more afraid of magic and curses. \u00a0These were mysterious powers of unknown origin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat shall we do, magician-nim? \u00a0We\u2019ll do anything. \u00a0If my child turns into a monster, I\u2026\u2026.!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI beg of you! \u00a0Please save my son!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were already very worried about their offsprings, but they found out there was a time limit to their rescue. \u00a0The townspeople were agitated, and they went wild. \u00a0If the soldiers were in front of them, they would have tried to rip them into pieces. \u00a0Moreover, Maetel was also in a similar state of agitation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet\u2019s go right now, Artpe! \u00a0I don\u2019t know where the children of this tow is right now, but I\u2019m sure the bad guys will do the same thing at different locations!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is as you say. \u00a0We don\u2019t know where they are, so do you really want to search the entire region?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStill, we have to do something!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, old stories and legends about heroes were rife with such scenarios.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Some town would fall into crisis, and the hero would try to solve a problem with the help of the townspeople. \u00a0However, a tragedy occurred when time ran out, and the hero would receive a big emotional burden. \u00a0However, the pain of this event would allow the hero to mature mentally.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHowever, we don\u2019t need to mature mentally, so we can skip that step.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Heroes who busily ran around deserts and jungles, while crying or laughing, were old news to him. \u00a0Artpe couldn\u2019t afford to waste his mental and physical energy like that.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What was so fun about searching everywhere, because one didn\u2019t know location where the Quest had to be carried out! \u00a0He was a new breed of hero where he would finish the Quest as soon as he received it!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEveryone get out of my way.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. \u00a0Yes, sir!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Several dozen Mana Threads turned into several hundred as they extended out from Artpe. \u00a0In a flash, they exited the town to spread into the region.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-oooh\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe looked as if he was standing still while he had his eyes closed. \u00a0However, even those that didn\u2019t know anything about Mana could feel a pressure coming from this strange energy, and the townspeople were unable to move. \u00a0Maetel, who had a decent idea on what was going on, let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you had such a simple solution, you should have told me in the first place.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWho said this was simple?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He took out a Mana potion bottle, and he drank it. \u00a0He focused on his control as he grumbled to himself.. \u00a0The several hundred Mana Threads were spreading in all directions, and the radius of the search increased steadily. \u00a0It increase to 500 meters, 1 kilometers, 2 kilometers and so on.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In his past life, he was level 350, so this would have been easy. \u00a0However, it wasn\u2019t easy at all right now! \u00a0If it wasn\u2019t for the Mana String spell that strengthened the Mana Thread to the extreme, it would have been impossible to attempt this move. \u00a0He briefly had this thought when he learned it, but it was a very cheat-like spell.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Wait a moment. \u00a0I could probably overlay my spell similarly to what Maetel did last time with her techniques\u2026...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wondered if his spell could be used in a more effective manner if he overlaid his perception skill on top of the Mana String.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe immediately put his theory into action, and of course, it came back as a resounding success. \u00a0He wondered if he was stealing and using Maetel\u2019s talent for such a trivial matter. \u00a0He had been afraid\u2026. \u00a0However, if he was to be truthful about it, he was thankful for it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFive kilometer. \u00a0Ten kilometer...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShall I lend you my Mana, Artpe?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou only have a modicum of Mana, so how.\u2026..I found them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was about to grumble towards Maetel when Artpe\u2019s eyes opened wide.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The townspeople looked at him with nervous eyes. \u00a0Aena looked at him with trust, since he had freed her body from the curse. \u00a0Maetel was ready to charge any opponents waiting for them\u2026..</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe spoke to them in a solemn manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet\u2019s go create an epilogue.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The place was located at a hill that was pretty far from the town. \u00a0In other words, it was a great place to run into a Dungeon in the wild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In this world, there were exactly two types of Dungeons. \u00a0The first type was the sleeping Dungeons that waited for a hero to find it. \u00a0The other type were Dungeons made by being that opposed the heroes. \u00a0These Dungeons contained dangerous traps, super secret information or secret tests. \u00a0These were Dungeons that had to be hidden away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The common point of the two types of Dungeons was the fact that heroes eventually found it to loot their contents. \u00a0The Dungeon in this hill would suffer the same fate.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou guys don\u2019t have to follow me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are helping us despite the dangers, so how can we stay behind\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou guys will get in the way, so just hide somewhere nearby. \u00a0Of course, it isn\u2019t my responsibility if you die in the process.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was an ex-Four Heavenly King turned hero, so he was remorseless. \u00a0He firmly got rid of nuisances that would get in the way of the Quest beforehand!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The townspeople became afraid when they realized there might be other dangers nearby. \u00a0However, they couldn\u2019t run away while leaving their children behind. \u00a0They firmly held to their edged tools they had brought from their homes. \u00a0They stood their ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW...we will wait for you here. \u00a0At the very least, we will greet our children from here!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cReally? \u00a0Aren\u2019t you guys just scared by the fact that soldiers might attack your town again?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI...it isn\u2019t like that!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed he hit the mark. \u00a0Artpe smirked as he tried to enter into the cave located at the middle of the hill\u2026..</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI want to go with you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. \u00a0You again?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Aena blocked their way. \u00a0She held a branch in one hand. \u00a0It was a weapon that even a goblin would have an easy time breaking.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe children will be afraid if only magician-nim\u2019s party enters. The children need at least one familiar face.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt isn\u2019t as if your words don\u2019t have merit, but you\u2026...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She would be perfect for the part of a supporting cast who died midway in the story. \u00a0Usually, the hero would rage at her death, and the boost provided by the emotion would lead the hero into victory.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, the girl\u2019s words were raising so many death flags that the stench coming from the death energy was unbearable. \u00a0It wouldn\u2019t be strange if she fell dead right now! \u00a0At the same time, it was also likely that she would come back out unharmed, since the circumstances was a bit suspicious.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI beg of you, magician-nim. \u00a0I know these children the best. \u00a0They are already afraid from being kidnapped by the soldiers. \u00a0If the magician-nim\u2019s party encounter the children in such a state, a large mistake may occur\u2026\u2026.!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had put a lot of thought into this. At this point, he couldn\u2019t turn turn her down. \u00a0From that moment on, Artpe decided to give up on Aena\u2019s life. \u00a0Yes, if she\u2019s meant to die, she would find a way to die eventually!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. \u00a0Your sacrifice will make it more likely that the children would be unharmed.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy is my sacrifice the premise of the children being safe!?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet\u2019s go, Maetel. \u00a0I\u2019ll leave the fighting to you. \u00a0When I tell you to stop, you have to stop.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI understand!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The party consisting of the two heroes and the Village Girl A left behind the townspeople. \u00a0They charged into the cave. \u00a0There was a very dark and dreary energy circulating within the cave. \u00a0A curse was mixed into the Dungeon\u2019s air. \u00a0To be precise, \u00a0it was curse meant to propagate a different spell.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou must be enjoying it since there are a lot to eat, right?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe took out the Obsidian, and it sucked in all the curses. \u00a0He never expected to find such a treasure within the normal town A at this point in time. \u00a0This was a loss for the Demon King\u2019s army!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. \u00a0As expected, I think Artpe would become a good father. \u00a0Ooh-hue-hue.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel watched Artpe fill the Obsidian with the curse. \u00a0She looked on with satisfaction as she mumbled to herself. \u00a0Aena wondered if she could trust these heroes that acted very strangely starting from the Dungeon\u2019s entrance. She had these thoughts, but she also didn\u2019t have much choice. \u00a0She followed behind them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When they entered a little bit deeper into the cave, the enemies soon appeared. \u00a0The soldiers they had seen from the town was mixed in with a batch of soldiers they had never seen before.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The most important fact was that there was a magician wearing a hooded robe standing within their midst.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuht!? \u00a0They are intruders. \u00a0Intruders!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBe careful. \u00a0He\u2019s the mage I saw in town\u2026..!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMagician? \u00a0That brat is one?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed the soldiers didn\u2019t feel any shame at being found out. \u00a0They immediately got ready to attack. \u00a0It meant they were fully aware of what they were doing, and they were prepared to kill to fulfill their goals.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At this point, he was sure that there was a connection between the archduke, the black magician and the Demon King\u2019s army. \u00a0Artpe was about to step forward as he grinded his teeth, but Maetel took one step forward before he was able to.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are making children into monsters\u2026.. \u00a0It\u2019s bad.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel\u2019s emerald colored eyes flashed from anger. \u00a0Artpe realized she had already finished judging who was good and evil.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAnyways, we\u2026\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the part where the hero and the villains confronted each other. \u00a0The villains would lay out their twisted logic behind their actions as they mocked the hero.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The hero would become enraged, and they would fight. \u00a0The bad guys liked to talk while fighting, so they would prattle on about the righteousness of their actions. \u00a0They would try to justify their cause. \u00a0The hero would get angry once again at their words. \u00a0The Death Knight within the Dungeon meant to foster the heroes was a great example of this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBe quiet! \u00a0Shut the hell up!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the current situation was different. \u00a0Maetel swung her bastard sword once before her enemies could pull their swords out or activate a spell. \u00a0They all fell to the floor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She hadn\u2019t activated her Berserk. \u00a0She wasn\u2019t even using her Strike skill. \u00a0It was a light attack that possessed not a single ounce of Mana.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-oooooh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were completely wiped out. \u00a0They didn\u2019t even have the time to give their lines. \u00a0The mage wasn\u2019t able to call out the Black Flame Dragon sealed within its right arm!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHeeeek\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Aena had depended on them, because she had seen the power of Artpe as a magician. \u00a0However, when she saw the terrible sight created by Maetel, her face turned pale.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, Maetel was the one who had created this terrible sight, yet it didn\u2019t feel real to her. \u00a0She tilted her head in confusion as she turned to speak to Artpe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThey are too weak, Artpe.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe did a double take when he heard her words, but a smile soon broke out on his face. \u00a0He nodded his head at her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Usually, a normal hero\u2019s first quest was accompanied by failure and hardships. \u00a0However, they had unintentionally leveled up as much as they could in the kingdom of Diaz. \u00a0In other words\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSince we are progressing towards part 2, this is normal.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPart 2?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel titled her head in puzzlement, but Artpe just smiled at her. \u00a0While Aena was still in an utter state of confusion, the heroes went through the entire Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No one could get in their way.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">When the Ancient Kraken was mobilized, he was able to see the heart of the ancient temple, which had been surrounded by darkness until this moment. \u00a0 Everything was revealed in front of his eyes. \u00a0Artpe\u2019s sharp eyes caught sight of the \u2018altar\u2019 located at the corner of the temple. \u00a0In a single moment, he was caught up to everything.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Artpe stacked several dozen Holy Barriers at once, and he was able to stop the lasers. \u00a0He shouted back some unexpected words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even as Maetel tried to undercut Artpe\u2019s orders with her words, she obediently turned around. \u00a0She grabbed ahold of Sienna, who couldn\u2019t run as fast as her. \u00a0Then she used Acceleration to run away with Sienna in tow!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Several strands of water tried to chase after her, but Artpe blocked them with the several dozen Holy Barriers he had created. \u00a0The attack was in vain. \u00a0This made the Kraken lose interest in chasing after Maetel. \u00a0Instead, it started to head towards Artpe!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">No matter how high its level was or how long it had lived, the Ancient Kraken was weak against the Mana of an Evil Reflector. \u00a0The Ancient Kraken didn\u2019t have the time to avoid the attack, so it took the beam head on. \u00a0 Cross-popping veins arose from the black body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It probably suffered very little pain from the attack when one considered the size of its body. \u00a0However, its eight tentacles twitched, and an incredible amount of water was sent towards the girls. \u00a0It flew like a bullet!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

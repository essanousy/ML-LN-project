what you gave me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh-gooooo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two of them now knew the value of the gem. \u00a0They still didn\u2019t know what kind of gem it was, but at the very least, they knew that it was the main reason why men had desperately tracked them down when they ran away from the palace.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Artpe stuck out his red tongue as he teased them. \u00a0He continued to pour Mana into the Demite\u2019s Gemstone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCan you hear me? \u00a0No , I don\u2019t think it can communicate yet.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Demite\u2019s Gemstone won\u2019t show its true worth until it was refined.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, it was such an amazing gem that it could amplify one\u2019s Mana, and it had the ability to remember magic spells. \u00a0Even at its current form, it was a remarkable item. \u00a0Artpe was satisfied with it until now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat are you trying to do with that! \u00a0Are you perhaps going to feed it to the Slime like the rocks from before?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are mad. \u00a0If you do that, the Slime would most definitely evolve a step forward\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat is what I want.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Giant Slime was desperately looking for a power that would allow it to overpower Maetel.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Again, the Dungeon\u2019s 10th floor acted in concert with the Giant Slime\u2019s struggle. \u00a0Large changes occurred once again. \u00a0The walls that divided the rooms melted away. \u00a0All the secret passageways were revealed. \u00a0The Dungeon allowed the Giant Slime to encounter the rest of the remaining Slimes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Keeeeeeee!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Gee-geek! \u00a0Gee-gee-gee!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The floor abruptly became a large plaza, and all the Slimes thrown away by the Dungeon knew what the Giant Slime intended. \u00a0They didn\u2019t want to die in vain, so they did their best to oppose the Giant Slime.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The party was watching mere Slimes. \u00a0It would theoretically be ridiculous for them to feel any emotions for the Slimes. \u00a0However, they were faced with an impressive and overwhelming sight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEven such simple organisms fight hard to live...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThey are no different than humans.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat kind of\u2026. \u00a0\u00a0Humans are\u2026.!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cQuiet.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t want to have a discourse about life with a brat. \u00a0Artpe let out a deep sigh, then for the last time, he injected his Mana into the Demite\u2019s Gemstone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His preparation was at an end.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow\u2019s your Mana reserve, Maetel?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf it is just maintaining Berserk, I have enough. \u00a0If I use the Option\u2026. \u00a0\u00a0I think I can use it about three times.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. \u00a0You should be on standby.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe didn\u2019t hesitate as he threw the purple colored gemstone held by his hand. \u00a0Coincidentally, one of the Slime, who had been opposing the Giant Slime, swallowed it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Gee-eeee-eeee]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt really ate it!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, it didn\u2019t matter how high the Slime\u2019s level was. \u00a0The Demite\u2019s Gemstone wasn\u2019t an item that would be dissolved so easily. \u00a0The Slime, who possessed the gem, knew it had become stronger. \u00a0It coordinated with the other Slimes to attack the Giant Slime.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Goo-ohhhhhhhhhhhh!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Giant Slime ate all of them. \u00a0The Giant Slime\u2019s wound healed easily from just eating its brethren.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Giant Slime\u2019s anatomy was simple, so it was easy for it to heal itself. \u00a0By eating its brethren, it was able to grow immediately, and it was leveling up at a fast pace. \u00a0This was why the Giant Slime had targeted them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe number of Slimes is decreasing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIn the beginning, there were around 5,000 of them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI don\u2019t know how this Dungeon was made, but the effects of Mana becomes stronger as one travels deeper into the Dungeon. \u00a0This is why this floor has stronger Slimes, and they are more numerous here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was easier for strong monsters to spawn at location with high density of Mana. \u00a0\u00a0Even if it was Maetel and Artpe, it would have taken them several days to kill all the Slimes that came out all at once from the secret passageways. \u00a0However, the Giant Slime was killing all of them instead.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis really is like the Record Link!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt isn\u2019t a completely closed system, so it won\u2019t be efficient like the Record Link. \u00a0However, if one wants to see an organism \u2018evolve\u2019, this might be a better method than the Record Link.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI look forward to it!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was very rare to come across such a high ranked Slime, so they would be able to look forward to the reward. \u00a0Artpe and Maetel was still conversing in a calm manner in front of such an overwhelming spectacle. \u00a0Silpennon and Leseti were taken aback by this fact, but they reached a point where they decided not to think about it any further.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. \u00a0It went in.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Delmite\u2019s Gemstone was inside the Giant Slime\u2019s body. \u00a0At that moment, the numerous mana-infused stones that was within its body reacted to the Delmite\u2019s Gemstone. \u00a0A small resonance started to occur. \u00a0Of course, this was what Artpe had been aiming for.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI see the end to the Slimes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe really don't have much time left. \u00a0Be ready, Maetel.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, I\u2019m ready.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There really were many varieties of Slimes nesting here. \u00a0Dungeons were something that was rare on the continent. \u00a0Maybe they were worth researching.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he was watching a single Slime consolidating all the Slimes it had eaten.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Geeeeeeeeeeeeee!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, all the structures on the 10th floor were gone, and the whole floor had been turned into a wide open plaza. \u00a0If one discounted the living and breathing members of Artpe\u2019s party, there was only one Giant Slime on the floor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had eaten everything within the Dungeon. \u00a0Everything that possessed Mana was within its body. \u00a0This was an unprecedented feat. \u00a0This being was pushing itself towards a higher Class.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Goo-ohhhhhhhhhhhhng!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMy god. \u00a0It is letting out light\u2026. \u00a0This is...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Slime must be evolving!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere is a higher Class that can be reached!?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe\u2019s eyes let out a strange light as he looked at the Slime letting out light from all over its body. \u00a0This was something that had never been seen before on this continent. \u00a0This moment was sweet and exciting!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe had a smile on his lips before he knew it. \u00a0He had come here in an attempt to educate Silpennon, so he had never expected to hit a jackpot here. \u00a0As expected, a Demon\u2026. \u00a0A human should be good to other people in one\u2019s life!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Giant Slime]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Level : 199]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When it went past level 100, it was given the name of Giant Slime. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At some point, a much bigger body appeared from within the light.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Huge Slime]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Level : 200]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The body of the Slime was letting out a rainbow light. \u00a0Its body possessed enormous amount of Mana, and its intelligence increased by another tier.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Its body was much bigger than before, but when it moved, it was more efficient in its use of energy. \u00a0Artpe immediately checked it with his Read All Creation ability, and he found out the Slime had several new skills. \u00a0These skills helped the Slime efficiently capture and digest its prey. \u00a0These needed skills were gathered in one place to strengthen the Slime.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The part that gave Artpe most joy was its name of Huge Slime. \u00a0It sounded extremely simple, but the name of this entity never existed on this continent before. \u00a0If he ranked how rare it was, it would probably be considered to be ultra rare.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere we go.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[There we go.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was as if Artpe and Slime had made a promise to speak at the same time. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As expected, it gained enough intelligence to be able decipher the human\u2019s intention!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I can eat you all!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When its body was trembling from delight, Artpe raised his voice to yell out loudly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou can attack it now, Maetel!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUnderstood!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I can now eat you all!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Slime was large enough to fill the plaza. \u00a0The evolved Slime attacked the party. \u00a0However, before it could use its skills, the Sword Energy gathered at the tip of the long sword was let loose. \u00a0The golden energy traveled in a straight line to impact on the Slime!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[This isn\u2019t enough\u2026..!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Huge Slime was strengthened so much that Maetel\u2019s Mana-infused attack pierced its body once before it healed its wound. \u00a0Maetel\u2019s attack stalled the Slime for only 3 seconds!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHyper Rubbing!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Artpe had completed all his preparations beforehand, so he had plenty of time to pull the trigger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Ggoo-ooooo-ooohk!?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Huge Slime let out a terrible scream as its body started to writhe. \u00a0The preys it had wanted to eat was right in front of it, yet it started to hit its body against the blameless Dungeon floor and walls. \u00a0It threw a fit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had gained higher intelligence, so the pain it perceived had increased dramatically. \u00a0The fact that it had been sure of its victory made the defeat a bitter pill to swallow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI never knew magic could be used this way....\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMagicians are a scary existence!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The target of Artpe\u2019s Hyper Rubbing were the rocks and the Delmite\u2019s Gemstone swallowed by the Slime.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had assumed that these objects were part of its body, but they started rubbing crazily against its body as if they had a mind of its own. \u00a0There was no way it could endure the spell without losing its mind!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Goo-oooooooh\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Still, it refused to give up. \u00a0It had broken through from the 1st floor to the 10th floor, and it had greedily eaten all the members of its race. \u00a0Mere pain wouldn\u2019t make it give up on its objective. \u00a0Its greed was too strong for that to happen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTsk. \u00a0As expected, this level of attack won\u2019t cut it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Delmite\u2019s Gemstone boosted the power of Hyper Rubbing by a ridiculous amount, so he had hoped this attack would be able to bring down the Slime. \u00a0However, he had underestimated its willpower.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Goo-ooohhhhhh! \u00a0I\u2019ll eat! I\u2019ll eat! \u00a0I\u2019ll eat! \u00a0I\u2019ll eat!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even as its body was breaking apart from within, it moved its body to attack the party. \u00a0When Silpennon and Leseti saw the enormous body of the Slime move slowly towards them, they didn\u2019t offer any resistance. \u00a0They just trembled in fear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Artpe put one hand atop Maetel\u2019s hand, which was gripping the longsword.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet\u2019s attack it for the second time, Maetel.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cY...yes..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was physical contact initiated by Artpe. \u00a0Maetel\u2019s heart felt as if it was on cloud nine. \u00a0She was so happy that it was difficult to maintain her Berserk skill. \u00a0If the skill was canceled, they would lose to the Slime.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was having a hard time controlling her emotions, so her eyes started to spin. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe didn\u2019t realize what she was feeling. \u00a0He gave her an order with a calm voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou just have to attack like before. \u00a0You should gather your energy and shoot it towards the Slime. \u00a0I\u2019ll take care of the rest.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, I\u2019ll try\u2026...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel worked desperately to control her heart, and she gathered her Mana at the tip of her sword. \u00a0At that moment, he used the Mana Link to provide Mana to her. \u00a0When she realized what was happening, Maetel used Record Divide, so Artpe could share more Mana with her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if it was the same skill, its power would be amplified by a lot.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShoot it. \u00a0Mana String.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, it was possible for the two of them to share each other\u2019s skills and options! \u00a0It was possible to combine all of them into one attack!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c!?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel felt the energy gathered inside the longsword change through magic, but she used her instinct to shoot it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were black stripes mixed in with the golden light as background. \u00a0This strange energy impacted on the Huge Slime\u2019s body, and it pierced through\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Koo-ahhhhhhhhhng!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe\u2019s will took hold of the attack. \u00a0The trajectory changed sharply as the attack drilled deeper into its body once again!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHyper Rubbing!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The attack wasn\u2019t at an end yet. \u00a0The Mana Strings that had manifested around the beam of light were imbued with the option of Hyper Rubbing. \u00a0The energy within him manifested as friction within, and it was being delivered right into the Slime!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a ridiculous composite spell. \u00a0The method Artpe had used possessed such a high degree of difficulty that it would have made all the other magicians on the continent feel disheartened!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAs expected, a mage is amazing!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cArtpe was always amazing!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cC...cool\u2026...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, everyone gathered in this place were idiots, so the only feedback he received was the fact that it was cool and amazing!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Koo-ohhhhhhhhhhhhhng!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Huge Slime let out a roar that contained its rage and pain. \u00a0It finally acquired the power that would enable it to eat all of its enemies. \u00a0It had been so sure, yet an unexpected attack had been used against it!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It couldn\u2019t use its power, because the stones within its body were constantly vibrating. \u00a0On top of that, an additional attack had been used against it. \u00a0It was so painful that it was driving it nuts!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I\u2019ll kill you at all cost! \u00a0I\u2019ll kill and eat you! \u00a0I\u2019ll kill you!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you going to ask the Dungeon for help again? \u00a0Well, the Dungeon no longer has anything hidden away that it can give you. \u00a0So what can you do?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a cruel light in Artpe\u2019s eyes as he looked at his struggling enemy. \u00a0The Slime extended its body to hit the wall, and it attempted to eat the weaker members of Artpe\u2019s party. \u00a0However, all of its attempts were thwarted by the Hyper Rubbing. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was as he said. \u00a0The Dungeon had given everything it had hidden to the Huge Slime. \u00a0There were no methods available to the Huge Slime that would allow it to strengthen itself again. \u00a0Its struggle was wasted. \u00a0It was all in vain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh. \u00a0The purple gem\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Leseti found herself to be pathetic, since she was trembling in front of the enemy without putting up any resistance. \u00a0She tried to right herself when she caught sight of the change that was occuring to the gem within the struggling Huge Slime. \u00a0The purple light was getting stronger as time passed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. \u00a0As that bastard reached the high rank Class, its ability to dissolve substance also increased by a lot. \u00a0The Demite\u2019s Gemstone is probably providing it with more power as it become more refined as time passes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Artpe kindly gave an explanation, Leseti\u2019s expression turned more peculiar.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou... you planned on refining the gem, while attacking your enemy\u2026.!?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious?

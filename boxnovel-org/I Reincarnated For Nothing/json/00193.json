talk.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe told a small joke, but no one laughed. \u00a0Their eyes were focused on the monster that was pushing through the gates of hell.</span></p><br/><p><span>[Koo-goo-goo-goo-goo, gee-gee-gee-ga-ga-ga-gahk.]</span></p><br/><p><span>The first thing to come out was an enormous black hand. \u00a0The hand was covered with bumpy calluses, and its radius was 10 meters. \u00a0Seven fingers moved tirelessly as Demonic energy emanated out towards all directions. \u00a0The toxicity of the Demonic energy was greater than the Demon King.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cFirst, let\u2019s destroy that door! \u00a0We have to somehow stop ourselves from being exposed to more Demonic energy \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo, Silpennon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe stopped him. \u00a0Silpennon\u2019s judgment would normally be absolutely correct, but that was also the reason why Artpe had to hold back Silpennon.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThere hadn\u2019t been any falsehood in the Demon King\u2019s words. \u00a0The son of a bitch was always annoying, but he rarely said anything false. \u00a0In that aspect, he wasn\u2019t like a Demon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cArtpe\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Everyone was looking towards Artpe. \u00a0They inevitably realized it when they fought against the Demon King. \u00a0Artpe and the Demon King knew each other too well. \u00a0If he was simply a young man that grew up in the countryside as a hero, there was no way this could be true.</span></p><br/><p><span>However, they didn\u2019t press for an answer. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>They loved Artpe too much to doubt him, and they relied on him. \u00a0They believed Artpe would reveal all if they needed to know the information. \u00a0They trusted him implicitly.</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe decided to reward them for their trust in him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you guys my story later. \u00a0Anyways, let\u2019s leave it alone for now. \u00a0Let it come out.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure you aren\u2019t trying get us all killed.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was unexpected. \u00a0The first one to follow Artpe\u2019s words was Silpennon. \u00a0He injected Mana into his daggers as he slowly retreated backwards. \u00a0He stood ready as he asked Artpe a question.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI think I know what you are trying to do. \u00a0You really are a mad lad.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt seems you aren\u2019t a king in name only.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>On the other hand, the other members of his party looked frightened by the large hand. \u00a0Artpe was keeping an eye on them. \u00a0At this point, \u00a0the hand had come through, and the wrist was starting to come out. \u00a0Artpe looked at the hand with his Read All Creation ability as he gave an explanation.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSince we killed the Demon King, you probably felt your level go up. \u00a0Right?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cMy head still hurts.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Leseti admitted it. \u00a0Leseti and Deyus had fallen behind in terms of level compared to the others in the party. \u00a0They hadn\u2019t been able to participate in the battle against the Demon King, but the whole party was tethered together by Maetel\u2019s ability. \u00a0The fact that they had helped manifest Maetel\u2019s Record Master skill was enough for them to experience an overwhelming \u00a0increase in level.</span></p><br/><p><span>They developed in many ways after overcoming an overwhelming obstacle called the Demon King. \u00a0There was no need to dwell on this topic. \u00a0Artpe nodded his head as he spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHowever, the Demon King said we won\u2019t be able to win against the previous Demon King. \u00a0We\u2026. \u00a0I have to learn about the Demonic god. \u00a0That is what he recommended me to do.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDidn\u2019t he summon that thing, because he wanted to kill us!?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWe will merely face a portion of the Demonic god.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe was sure of it.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWe have to grow by defeating that thing. \u00a0The previous Demon King might call forth the power of the Demonic god. \u00a0The current Demon King thought this will give us a winning chance against such power. \u00a0I\u2019m of the same mind. \u00a0If we defeat it, we\u2019ll be able to grow substantially.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOnce a chef, always a chef\u2026.. \u00a0Still, he was an asshole until the end.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSo you want us to suck on our thumbs until that thing comes out fully!?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Elrick asked in fright. \u00a0Artpe shook his head from side to side.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI said we\u2019ll face only part of the Demonic god. \u00a0Even if we leave this spell alone, it\u2019ll terminate on its own. \u00a0I have two piece of information that might give us hope\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>First, they won\u2019t have to fight the whole Demonic god. \u00a0Secondly, they would be defeating a \u2018part of the Demonic god\u2019 right now. \u00a0Even if the past Demon King made a play for using the Demonic god\u2019s power, Artpe\u2019s party would be fighting a reduced version of it.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou call that \u00a0positive news\u2026. \u00a0 Ha-ah.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cMr Silpennon, get a hold of \u00a0yourself!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWe really have to fight that thing? \u00a0Really?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe was taking a \u00a0hard-line, so the party had to grin and bear it. \u00a0Up until now, Artpe had never made the wrong decision. \u00a0He was probably right about this too.</span></p><br/><p><span>They were already tired from fighting the Demon King, yet they had to fight a monster that was summoned through the death of the Demon King!</span></p><br/><p><span>They felt frustrated, but no one complained. They couldn\u2019t do it. \u00a0They knew who they will have to fight in the future.</span></p><br/><p><span>This was the hero\u2019s path. \u00a0They chose to walk besides the hero, so they just had to endure it until the end.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cW\u2026.wrist. \u00a0I...it\u2019s wrist is coming out.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe Demonic energy\u2026. \u00a0 Artpe, are you able to block it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He looked down at the magic tome in his hand. \u00a0It was letting out a faint light. \u00a0He had activated it before the battle with Demon King started, so he was reaching the limit on how much Mana he possessed.</span></p><br/><p><span>However, he had no plans on backing down now. \u00a0It also didn\u2019t mean that he was going to use the Magic Stones and Artifacts he confiscated from the merchant companies and all the nations.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019ll regenerate the Demonic energy into Mana, and I\u2019ll let the magic tome consume it as soon as it become available.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>For a brief moment, his party had no idea what he was talking about. \u00a0Despite being in a desperate situation, they froze in place. \u00a0However, they started to comprehend what he was talking about. \u00a0They started to jump up and down in order.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat item is invincible!? \u00a0If it is capable of doing that, why did you bring the Magic Stones and Artifacts?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI need materials to purify the Demon realm. \u00a0I need it for the Reclamation magic where I\u2019ll turn this world back into its original form. \u00a0If I consume the Mana of this world in the process, this world will be turned into a place of death.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Currently, Demonic energy was being summoned from a different world. \u00a0In order to eliminate that energy, he was going to consume it, and it would cause no harm to this world.</span></p><br/><p><span>Above all else, it was an energy that couldn\u2019t be controlled even by that thing of evil. \u00a0There was no downside in stealing that energy. \u00a0It didn\u2019t even have to be him\u2026..</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cPipi, I\u2019ll leave it to you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Soon, something happened that blew the mind of the party. \u00a0Artpe had let go of the staff after lightly gripping it, then he let go of the magic tome. \u00a0 The staff started to revolve around the magic tome, and the Reclamation magic continued to work.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is sucking in the terrifying bastard\u2019s Demonic energy, and it is being changed into Mana\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe spell is being maintained by the Mana\u2026\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is being done by the staff!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cVersatile Pipi.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhy is Regina being so proud of it\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>At this point, everyone was dumbfounded that words were hard to come by. \u00a0It meant Artpe had hidden this power even as he faced the horrifying Demon King!</span></p><br/><p><span>In other words, he had a backup plan against the Demon King\u2019s trump card. \u00a0He had instructed Silpennon to borrow Aria\u2019s power, and Silpennon was put on standby. \u00a0It seemed there had been another plan aside from that. \u00a0His party members couldn\u2019t hold back their exclamation at Artpe\u2019s meticulous planning.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe door is decreasing in size!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>[Koo-goo-goo-goo-goo-goo-goohk, koo-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-gah!]</span></p><br/><p><span>The staff and the magic tome became the core of the Reclamation magic, and they slowly moved to a safer location. \u00a0As they did so, the door to hell kept shrinking. \u00a0It was as Artpe had said.</span></p><br/><p><span>[Kee-heeeeek! \u00a0Kuh-hoo-ooh-hoo-koo-koo-ga-ga-gahk!]</span></p><br/><p><span>A truly large black arm had been slowly emerging from the door, and the door was closing in the middle of its emergence. \u00a0It was unknown as to where the sound had originated, but a horrible scream could be heard. \u00a0The arm and the hand started to twist and turn. \u00a0Artpe coldly watched it \u00a0with his Read All Creation ability, and he spoke in a firm manner.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cEtna, Sienna and Maetel will move to the front. \u00a0Regina will defend.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It meant he wanted everyone else to back out. \u00a0Silpennon had delivered the critical blow to the Demon King, yet Artpe wanted him to stay out of this fight!</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIn the end, you are going to do that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHoo-ooh. \u00a0Everyone gather up! \u00a0Hurry!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>However, no one in the party complained including Silpennon. \u00a0Artpe had already explained such a scenario to the party members beforehand. \u00a0This wasn\u2019t a simple smokescreen.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cMaetel\u2026 \u00a0If possible, I want you to stay back\u2026. \u00a0However, this will be impossible without you. \u00a0Are you able to control the skill and fight at the same time?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t ask something so obvious, Artpe.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Maetel gripped her bastard sword harder as she slightly turned towards Artpe. She let out a light laughter. \u00a0Her eyes were filled with love, and it was all focused on Artpe. \u00a0It almost made one\u2019s skin crawl.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIf it is for Artpe, I\u2019m willing to do anything you want. \u00a0Anything.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt would have been better if you said you were fighting for peace or camaraderie\u2026. \u00a0However, I\u2019ll have to be satisfied with that answer for now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>After the party members leveled up after killing the Demon King, Maetel had paused the Record Master skill. \u00a0She started it up once again. \u00a0Artpe didn't give any orders, yet everyone gathered up in one place. \u00a0They sat down as if they had promised to do this. \u00a0Regina was the only one standing. \u00a0She stepped in front of the group as she raised her staff.</span></p><br/><p><span>Despite what Pipi and the magic tome was doing, the Demonic energy wasn\u2019t fully purified. \u00a0This was why Regina created a barrier of cold air, and the Demonic energy couldn\u2019t encroach into it. \u00a0Regina\u2019s role was to defend her party members.</span></p><br/><p><span>So why not just move them farther out? \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>It all made sense when one saw Maetel and Sienna borrow magical energy, stamina and strength from her party members through the Record Master. \u00a0Artpe spoke quietly.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cFinal battle mode.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cMmm. \u00a0That name is embarrassing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>All for one, one for all. \u00a0It was a common phrase that everyone strived for, but it was something impossible to achieve. \u00a0However, it was possible through Maetel\u2019s skill.</span></p><br/><p><span>She had a skill called Record Master that could manipulate Records of others. \u00a0This was embarrassing to voice out loud, but the members of Artpe\u2019s party had strong trust in each other. \u00a0This allowed Maetel to move strength, stamina and other physical abilities to the other members of her party.</span></p><br/><p><span>Until now, she hadn\u2019t really used this ability in a real battle. \u00a0Even when she used it once or twice, it had been on the spur of the moment. \u00a0However, Artpe thought this ability would be crucial when dealing with a stronger opponent. \u00a0If the person she was borrowing the power was also strong, he surmised that the benefit would be that much greater.</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe\u2019s party members had grown so much that they were considered to be the pinnacle of the human race. \u00a0They were all sitting in one place, and they were lending their power to Maetel and Sienna.</span></p><br/><p><span>[Koo-goo-ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!]</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is coming.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Fortunately, the arm started to move when the party had safely made all their preparations. The door to hell was forcefully closed. \u00a0As a result, the arm was severed before the shoulder joint. \u00a0An enormous amount of blood was pouring out, yet the arm started to slowly advance.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was letting out Demonic energy that was eating away at the cave\u2019s floor and the air. \u00a0Despite its speed not being fast, the Demonic energy was too powerful. \u00a0The cave continued be destroyed as the arm\u2019s zone of influence expanded.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNyaaaaaaaah.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Roa let out a cry. \u00a0She hadn\u2019t been able to do much in the fight against the Demon King. \u00a0She let out a cry of joy when she saw the enormous arm. \u00a0It seemed the sight had whetted her appetite.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes, you are here too. \u00a0If we win against it, I\u2019ll let you eat all of it. \u00a0I\u2019ll leave it to you, Roa.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNyaa. \u00a0I love you, master. \u00a0Nyaa-ah-ah.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>[Koo-ga-ga-ahhhhhhhhhh!]</span></p><br/><p><span>Roa\u2019s three tails swayed as her fighting spirit peaked. \u00a0It was still unknown as to where the sound was coming from, but the Demonic god\u2019s arm let out a roar as it charged forward.</span></p><br/><p><span>The battle commenced.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

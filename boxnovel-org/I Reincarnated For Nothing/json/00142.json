background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Shadows of Sinners possessed and reacted to Demonic energy. \u00a0By knowing their special property, it wasn\u2019t difficult to pinpoint when the acceleration had occurred. \u00a0It was when the Demon King\u2019s army started to work in earnest within the human realm. \u00a0Their Demonic energy started to mix into the Mana of the human realm.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

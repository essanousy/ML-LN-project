He might have helped in a magic research that created the Evil Heart. \u00a0Or maybe he was carrying out a plan that he thought would destroy the Evil Heart. \u00a0Instead, it was part of someone\u2019s plan to do something evil. \u00a0There are several possibilities. \u00a0If there was a faction within humanity that tried to betray him, I can understand why he would feel despair.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The item called the Evil Heart was letting out a horrific amount of Demonic energy. \u00a0Despite putting it inside the Dimensional Pouch, the Demonic energy was leaking out of the pouch. \u00a0Vadinet\u2019s Sanctuary spell had to purify it continuously. \u00a0If one thought sticking the item in a different dimension would make it safe, one would have been mistaken.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Artpe glanced at the Demonic energy being emitted by the Evil Heart from within the Dimensional Pouch. \u00a0He looked up. \u00a0He saw Roa ripping out the neck of the enormous Shadow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

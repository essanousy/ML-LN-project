text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">In a flash, Artpe became dumbfounded. \u00a0He mumbled to himself. \u00a0He thought his eyes were playing tricks on him, so he rubbed his eyes before he looked at the Demon King again. \u00a0However, he could still see the shackles around the Demon King\u2019s neck. \u00a0It was the Absolute Control, which had allowed the Demon King to subjugate his underlings.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">[An already completed spell can once again change its shape\u2026. \u00a0You got me this time. \u00a0I admit it.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">The Demon King mumbled to himself as he rubbed at his neck. \u00a0An amazing amount of Demonic energy made the collar turn faint. \u00a0In the end, the collar was gone. \u00a0However, Artpe possessed the Read All Creation ability, and he could clearly see the trace left behind by the collar. \u00a0The collar wasn\u2019t completely gone. \u00a0It just spoke to the reality that the Demon King was resisting against the shackles placed on him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">As expected, monsters over level 400 were able to resist against the power of Absolute Control. \u00a0However, it wasn\u2019t the time to have such idle thoughts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">[There are constraints to using Absolute Control. \u00a0I\u2019m right, aren\u2019t I?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">[\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Even the Read All Creation ability had a tough time seeing through to the true nature of an Innate ability. \u00a0However, clues had been presented in front of his eyes. \u00a0If he couldn\u2019t figure this out, Artpe deserved to die.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">[If you are able to win against your opponent, you are able to control them. \u00a0However, if you lose, the opposite happens. \u00a0You will become subjugated to the winner. \u00a0You lost to the previous Demon King, so you are subjugated to him.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">[You were able to discern everything in such a short amount of time. \u00a0However, this is my Innate ability. \u00a0As you can see, it is merely an ability that I can control.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">The Demon King was lying. \u00a0The Absolute Control was a peerless skill, but as a price, its owner couldn't control it. \u00a0It was a dangerous ability. \u00a0In short, it \u00a0was a powerful magic, but it was like a nasty curse that can turn on its user if it wasn\u2019t successfully used against one\u2019s enemy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">The Demon King was using his massive reservoir of Demonic energy to resist against the Innate ability. \u00a0However, he could only loosen the shackles. \u00a0He couldn\u2019t escape it. \u00a0Of course, a huge portion of his power was tied up right now in order to resist against his shackles. \u00a0The fact that he still had this much Demonic energy left was frightening, but\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u2018Did he make this stage to orchestrate his own death?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Artpe met eyes with the Demon King. \u00a0Artpe wanted to read the Demon King\u2019s intent, but he once again realized that it was useless. \u00a0He decided there was no reason to pussyfoot around this. \u00a0The Read All Creation ability could\u2019t read thoughts. \u00a0Artpe just had to push a bit harder, and he was sure he\u2019ll be able to find out the Demon King\u2019s intent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cHe is in a weakened state right now. \u00a0We have to defeat him right now!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cOk!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cUnderstood!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">He didn\u2019t bother giving an explanation. \u00a0He just delivered a correct assessment of an enemy that had to be defeated! \u00a0The flustered Demon King once again poured out a fierce wave of Demonic energy. \u00a0However, Maetel and Sienna just shrugged off the Demonic energy. \u00a0They charged towards the Demon King! \u00a0Maetel ran through the storm of Demonic energy, and she raised her long sword high into the air.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cBash!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">It was a simple Bash skill, but there was a light encasing her sword. \u00a0It was the advanced spell form of the Hero\u2019s Aura called the Hero Flash. \u00a0All of the power within her spell was infused into a normal, yet high quality bastard sword. \u00a0It became akin to a holy word. \u00a0The Demon King glared at her as he faced her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">[It seems level isn\u2019t the only thing you\u2019ve improved on!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cThe fight with you\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 I can finish it now!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">The light and the Demonic energy ran amok as they covered the nearby premise. \u00a0Sienna used this opportunity to bring down her hammer. \u00a0The Demon King quickly teleported, and the Demon King\u2019s chair was destroyed instead. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cThe fight will start for real now. \u00a0I can hear his heartbeat quicken.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cI remember it\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 Hoo-ooooh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">The only one that had an inherent advantage over the Demon King in terms of attribute was Etna. \u00a0Aside from ice, her flame could burn everything.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">The Demon King\u2019s heart quickened, because it was the source of his existence. \u00a0A fatally poisonous Demonic energy was pumped out of his heart, and it dispersed from his back. \u00a0It was as if he had wings made out of poisonous vapor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">[You think too much, my lovely puppet. \u00a0It seems your magic is no longer as sharp when aiming for my neck. \u00a0It seems your heart is moving before your hands.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">[What a load of bullshit. \u00a0If that is true, does your mouth move before your Demonic energy?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">The Reclamation magic was already on the rise. \u00a0Part of the Demon King\u2019s Demonic energy had already been purified. \u00a0Artpe\u2019s party just had to push him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cI\u2019ll block all of his Demonic energy, so you guys should hurry up and just rush him!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cHoo-ahhhhhhhhhp!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">[You can\u2019t defeat me just by rushing me!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Artpe had slightly slowed down the use of his spell. \u00a0He was worried about an unexpected situation. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u2018What if I purify him? \u00a0What will happen if I change him back into a human?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Artpe already had experience of reverting a Demon into a human.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">He had done it with the lovely woman, who was using her fire, next to him. \u00a0Etna was born with a power that was incompatible with her identity as a Demon. \u00a0It had been akin to her suffering from a disease. \u00a0However, she was barely able to find her true self, and she had awakened to her Innate ability.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">If that was true\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">What if he accidentally purified the Demon King? \u00a0Would the Demon King\u2019s Innate ability evolve in the worst possible direction? \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Artpe had this thought when he saw the collar around the Demon King\u2019s neck. \u00a0He never heard of an ability that gave penalty to its user. \u00a0That meant the Demon King\u2019s Innate ability wasn\u2019t whole. \u00a0Basically, the Demon King was in a similar situation as Etna.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">It seemed the Demon King had also realized this fact. \u00a0He probably found out this defect in his ability when he lost to the previous Demon King. \u00a0Since there was no way he would submit to the previous Demon King, he had to find a different method. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">According to Artpe\u2019s bank of knowledge, the only method that could accomplish this was the Reclamation magic.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Of course, the Demon King was currently weakened since he was resisting against his shackles. \u00a0However, Artpe wonder if the Demon King was purposefully suffering under Artpe\u2019s magic. \u00a0What if he was trying to escape the body of a Demon?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u2018If it is him, it is possible. \u00a0I have to weigh that possibility. \u00a0Maybe, he is trying to create something here that\u2019ll allow him to advance to the next stage.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Artpe took a deep breath as he grabbed his magic tome. \u00a0The wings made by Demonic energy resolved into a black dragon. \u00a0It was crawling through the air.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">However, this was why the Demon King was crafty. \u00a0He used a flashy spell to look cool, and at the same time, he stealthily used other spells to put pressure on his enemy. \u00a0Of course, Artpe knew all of this. \u00a0This was why he couldn\u2019t let the Demon King escape being the target of the Reclamation magic!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Artpe kept cancelling the Demon King\u2019s spell before it could manifest. \u00a0It was as if the Demon King was only fighting with his body. \u00a0This was also true with Arpte, since he was challenging the Demon King with his magic. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">The never ending black Demonic energy was being invaded and eaten away by the purple Mana. \u00a0It was like heat and cold fighting against each other. \u00a0If one could see the the power being used, one would come away impressed. \u00a0From the perspective of those that were ignorant, it looked as if they were having a staring contest!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">[What are you afraid of? \u00a0What is stopping you? \u00a0Look, Artpe. \u00a0Look at your Mana and my Demonic energy mingling with each other. \u00a0If you want to see a much more decorated stage, you better take a step back!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">[Don\u2019t worry about that. \u00a0When I write my autobiography, I\u2019ll set off couple fireworks in the description for you. \u00a0In the old tales, I hate the stories where the magicians fight each other. \u00a0They keep boasting about their great magic as if they are passing a baton back and forth between each other. \u00a0Those scenes annoy me the most.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Artpe, Etna and Regina played key roles as they fought a fierce magical battle that couldn\u2019t be seen with the naked eye. \u00a0On the other hand, the other close combat party members rallied around Maetel and Sienna. \u00a0They left behind their fear for the Demon King, and they bravely attacked the Demon King.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">[Ha! \u00a0You are hiding something that I don\u2019t know about..]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">The lowest leveled party member was Leseti, but she had grown a lot in the Dungeon prepared by the Demon King. \u00a0She was able to wound him now. \u00a0However, the thing that helped her the most was the holy priestess\u2019 Blessing and the Hero\u2019s Flash that was infused at the end of her sword. \u00a0It would have been impossible to seriously injure the Demon King without it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Maetel had evolved her Record Master. \u00a0In the end, she was able to share the Hero\u2019s Flash with any party members related to Artpe and her!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">When Sienna and Maetel created openings, the rest of Artpe\u2019s party members rushed in to injure the Demon King. \u00a0When the Demon King was about to counter attack, Sienna showed unrivaled bravery by charging the Demon King!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

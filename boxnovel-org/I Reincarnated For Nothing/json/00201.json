You were chosen to live a life that was full of ups and downs. \u00a0It was all decided when we were born. \u00a0One can use one\u2019s outstanding mind to learn and use magic, or one could use one\u2019s Innate Ability to use magic. \u00a0Basically, the cause and effect is the same.]</span></p><br/><p><span>His words couldn\u2019t be denied. \u00a0A genius was merely a person born with a natural gift. \u00a0Even if one achieved greatness through an Innate ability, it still fell under the umbrella of the title called genius.</span></p><br/><p><span>[We all have our own ways of gaining achievements as we live. \u00a0In the end, I was able to rise to this position. \u00a0I worked hard to reach this height, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ll willfully ignore the efforts made by others. \u00a0Do you think you would have been able to reach your current position without your natural gifts? \u00a0No. \u00a0We are special. We are what people call geniuses. ]</span></p><br/><p><span>Nanarai Bodra spoke as he started to move towards Etna. \u00a0Afterwards, Etna\u2019s body faded away, and she appeared next to Artpe. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t a physical phenomena. \u00a0It was the power of a Spirit, and it was something that couldn\u2019t be explained through Mana.</span></p><br/><p><span>[It seems she had enough power left to retreat, yet she remained on the battlefield. \u00a0 She moved next to you\u2026\u2026 \u00a0It seems she really loves you, my junior.]</span></p><br/><p><span>A bitter laughter appeared on the sunbae\u2019s lips. \u00a0It was assumed that he had turned into a complete idiot after falling under the Seduction ability. \u00a0It seemed that wasn\u2019t true. \u00a0He was being played by Garnet, yet he was self-aware of his own situation.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cMmm. \u00a0I\u2019m not sure if you know this, but there is a bond between us. \u00a0Since the ancient times, the Demon King\u2019s party went nuts when it was mentioned. \u00a0Why aren\u2019t you reacting the same way?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>[Bonds. \u00a0I know about it. I once believed in that. \u00a0However, when I chose to betray myself\u2026. \u00a0I no longer believe it.]</span></p><br/><p><span>The magic missiles flew towards Artpe. \u00a0However, the Hand of Destruction stopped all of the magic missle. \u00a0The Hand of Destruction was capable of vaporizing most of the magic circles before they could do anything.</span></p><br/><p><span>[Powerful. \u00a0It is powerful. \u00a0What is that hand? \u00a0I devised a magic circle should have stopped and destroyed that hand. \u00a0Why isn\u2019t it working? \u00a0It is quite mysterious.]</span></p><br/><p><span>Of course, Artpe didn\u2019t let his guard down. \u00a0In terms of Innate Ability, Nanarai Bodra was a more fearsome foe than Garnet. \u00a0 Artpe had gone through the prepared Dungeons, and he had gained the Mana String. \u00a0He was able to gain the Materialization magic through the Mana Strings. \u00a0It made Artpe wonder if Nanarai Bodra\u2019s Record had a part in everything he had gained!</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018It is possible for me to resist him to a certain degree using my Materialization magic. \u00a0It\u2019ll be important for me to find out what angle he plans on taking with the Magic Circle Creation. \u00a0If so, I\u2019ll be able to counter\u2026..\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe extended the Hand of Destruction outwards as he put it on defense. \u00a0Then he emptied one Dimensional Pouch. He filtered the Magic Stones through the Reclamation Magic, and he gave the portion of the Mana to Etna. \u00a0In a flash, she regained consciousness.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKah, hoohk\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cEtna, you should rest.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKoo-ooh\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI was able to find out what he was hiding thanks to you. \u00a0I can win this, so you should relax.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>At Artpe\u2019s reliable words, she mutely nodded her head. \u00a0Then she lost consciousness once again. \u00a0He was able to recharge her Mana, but it was up to Etna to turn the Mana into Spirit energy. \u00a0He just had to hope that she would be able to recover from the shock.</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe left Etna in the care of Regina, and he decided to directly confront Nanarai. \u00a0To be precise, no one other than him was capable of going against Nanarai.</span></p><br/><p><span>[Ho. \u00a0Is that a Demite? \u00a0Amazing. \u00a0I heard a staff made out of Demite could conjure magic, but I never expected it to be able to maintain a great magic by itself!]</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou talk too much.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Pipi was given the possession of the the Reclamation magic tome. \u00a0On top of that, Artpe had consumed Artifacts and Magic Stones to expand the radius of the Reclamation spell once again.(This simple act had the effect of cutting away at the Demonic Energy available to Nanarai and Garnet.) \u00a0Artpe stepped forward, and a skein of Mana Strings letting out purple light swirled around both his hands.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cFight me, sunbae-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>[I see. \u00a0In the end, we have to resort to violence!]</span></p><br/><p><span>The magic missiles flooded forward. \u00a0Hundreds of thousands of magic missiles erupted from Nanarai\u2019s body. \u00a0There were so many that the only apt description was a flood of magic missiles. \u00a0The more shocking part was that each magic missile held the power of a different spell.</span></p><br/><p><span>Nanarai was being weakened by the Declaration of Demonic Extermination and the Reclamation magic. \u00a0Artpe had no idea where Nanarai\u2019s power was coming from.</span></p><br/><p><span>Wait a moment\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018An endless amount of Demonic energy is surging out of him. \u00a0He isn\u2019t generating this Demonic energy, and he isn\u2019t getting it from this world either.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>Countless number of magic missiles struck Artpe and his party. \u00a0Artpe didn\u2019t push the Hand of Destruction forward. \u00a0He unraveled the Mana Strings from his skein, and he created a defensive magic. \u00a0It blocked all the magic missiles, and the Mana Strings accelerated towards Nanarai.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018His body is unstable. \u00a0He doesn\u2019t have any Artifacts or potion. \u00a0I\u2019m turning the Demon realm into the human realm \u00a0right now. \u00a0As a Demon, he shouldn\u2019t be getting stronger. \u00a0 Where is his Demonic energy coming from? \u2026.where?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe thought about the words written by the past Nanarai. \u00a0Ninety nine percent of his words had been boasts, and one percent had been the truth. \u00a0He thought about the words recorded on the altar. \u00a0What did the humans do when they were trying to change Mana into Demonic energy? \u00a0What did they call forth, and where was it from?</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou bastard.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe felt chills run up his body. \u00a0Artpe had unraveled the truth. \u00a0He yelled out in disbelief.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou are using the power of the Demonic god!?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>[You were able to recognize that?!]</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt was a guess, yet it seems I was right\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>This bastard had lost his mind, but at one time, he knew about the dangers of being connected to the Demonic god. \u00a0That was why he had separated and sealed the Evil Heart. \u00a0Artpe had never expected Nanarai to use his body to create an opening to the Demonic god!</span></p><br/><p><span>[Can you accept it now, my junior? \u00a0There is no way you can win against me. \u00a0I can bring whatever I desire into this reality. \u00a0Your death and the Demonification of the human realm\u2026. \u00a0It will all occur as I desire. \u00a0\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I just need the Evil Heart.]</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe had somewhat predicted this, but the Evil Heart must be essential to the process of turning the human realm into a Demon realm.</span></p><br/><p><span>Even if Nanarai could borrow the Demonic god\u2019s power, he couldn\u2019t indefinitely produce Demonic energy like the Evil Heart. \u00a0This was why they were searching for the sealed fragments of the Evil Hearts. \u00a0It really was an ironic situation.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018The most dangerous thing we face right now is\u2026..\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>Garnet was fighting a fierce battle with Maetel and Sienna. \u00a0Artpe was using his Materialization magic to fight against Nanarai\u2019s magic. \u00a0The danger wouldn\u2019t be coming from them.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNyaaaaaaa. \u00a0Hurry. \u00a0I wanna eat. \u00a0Nyaa-ah-ah.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Roa had stayed behind to protect Regina and the rest of the party. \u00a0Still, she was waiting for her turn to come. \u00a0Wasn\u2019t she the Greed Beast, who ate all the Evil Hearts and the beings that possessed Demonic energy?</span></p><br/><p><span>[Your movements have slowed down, my junior]</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou haven\u2019t moved from your spot.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe realized something. \u00a0Nanarai Bodra and the Demon King Garnet wasn\u2019t using their full might in this fight. \u00a0 They realized that Artpe was using the Reclamation magic. \u00a0It meant that Artpe\u2019s party possessed the Evil Heart, so they were biding their time in order to steal the Evil Heart.</span></p><br/><p><span>[What shall we do, Artpe?]</span></p><br/><p><span>It was Maetel\u2019s voice. \u00a0Artpe was firm in his answer.</span></p><br/><p><span>[We have to kill Nanarai first. \u00a0HIs magic circles are too dangerous.]</span></p><br/><p><span>[Understood. \u00a0I\u2019ll leave her to you for a brief moment, Sienna.]</span></p><br/><p><span>[Yes!]</span></p><br/><p><span>In a flash, the three party members shared their intentions. \u00a0Long words were unnecessary. \u00a0Artpe consumed several Magic Stones, and in a flash, he increased the number of Mana Strings. \u00a0Nanarai couldn\u2019t react properly to the suddenly fierce attack. \u00a0He was defenseless as he retreated backwards.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDie!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat isn\u2019t a line that a hero should say!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>[Koo-huhk!?]</span></p><br/><p><span>Maetel immediately used her Acceleration ability to move away from the Demon King. \u00a0In a flash, she stabbed her bastard sword into Nanarai\u2019s chest.</span></p><br/><p><span>The Mana Strings had blocked all the magic missiles. \u00a0The remaining Mana Strings stuck to Nanarai\u2019s body, and they nullified the magic circles placed on Nanarai\u2019s body. \u00a0Nanarai hadn\u2019t expected this, so his eyes widened in shock.</span></p><br/><p><span>[How\u2026...]</span></p><br/><p><span>[Nanarai!]</span></p><br/><p><span>The Demon King didn\u2019t love him. \u00a0However, he was her most perfect and only comprade. \u00a0Garnet turned around in fright when Nanarai\u2019s life was threatened. \u00a0In a flash, she saw Maetel. \u00a0 Garnet hadn\u2019t been able to prevent Maetel from moving away. \u00a0She instantly saw Maetel getting ready to execute Nanarai.</span></p><br/><p><span>[You dare turn your back towards me!]</span></p><br/><p><span>At her gesture, an enormous whip made out of Demonic energy appeared. \u00a0It flew towards Artpe and Maetel. \u00a0However, Sienna stepped in between to block the attack. \u00a0The shield held the holy energy of Vadinet, and Sienna\u2019s own Mana. \u00a0She was able to block and destroy the Demonic whip. \u00a0Garnet\u2019s mouth became distorted.</span></p><br/><p><span>[From the beginning, I knew you were repugnant. \u00a0 You denied the blessing of the Demon race. \u00a0 \u00a0You degenerated into becoming a bizarre existence that goes against common sense\u2026. \u00a0 Unfortunately, I do not have a spot for you in the world I will open.]</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOppa protected this body. \u00a0Oppa made this race for me. \u00a0My Mana is for oppa.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>As always, Sienna was calm and composed. \u00a0Her ardor was small and quiet, yet it burned endlessly.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI don't care what you think. \u00a0I will stop you\u2026. \u00a0You are trying to forcefully change humans into Demons. \u00a0I cannot forgive you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>[I get it now\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7!]</span></p><br/><p><span>Nanarai, who had sounded like he was about to die, shouted out. \u00a0He really was cutting it close. \u00a0He was able to assess the movements of Artpe, Maetel and Sienna. \u00a0He also found out the structure of the Reclamation magic.</span></p><br/><p><span>[Garnet! \u00a0That cat! \u00a0It\u2019s that cat! \u00a0She hasn\u2019t stepped forward yet!]</span></p><br/><p><span>Afterwards, Maetel\u2019s sword cut off Nanarai\u2019s head. \u00a0Nanarai\u2019s favorite magic circle was a Regeneration magic circle. \u00a0Tens of thousands of strands erupted from the magic circle, but Artpe used his Materialization magic to stop the regeneration. \u00a0Nanarai couldn\u2019t do anything, but greet his own death.</span></p><br/><p><span>[She\u2019s a cat?]</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNyaa-ahhhhh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Nanarai\u2019s message was delivered to Garnet. \u00a0Artpe clicked his tongue as he burned Nanarai\u2019s corpse.</span></p><br/><p><span>[I see. \u00a0 Evil Heart!]</span></p><br/><p><span>Garnet yelled out. \u00a0Roa didn\u2019t know what was going on. \u00a0</span><span>Nyaa.</span></p><br/><p><span>She let out another cute cry. \u00a0Artpe and Maetel desperately charged forward.</span></p><br/><p><span>At that moment, a light erupted from something within Garnet\u2019s possession.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a legacy left behind by Nanarai. \u00a0He had left it behind for Garnet.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

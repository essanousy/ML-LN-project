vertical-align: baseline\">At some point, the Demons that were carrying out the Demonification research in the human realm had disappeared. \u00a0The reason behind this was simple. \u00a0When Artpe killed Jeriet, the Seros company had atrophied. \u00a0Most of Jeriet\u2019s project had been intertwined with the business of the Seros company, so all their plans had come to a halt</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">At the time, the Four Heavenly King and the powerful Demons, who had been following the orders of the previous Demon King, were having a hard time exiting the Demon realm. \u00a0Amongst the Demons that were already present in the human realm, none were as strong as Jeriet. \u00a0This was why the Seros merchant company had lost their clout.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">As a result, a stalemate occurred. \u00a0This was why the Demons were hiding in the secret headquarters of the Seros company.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cAt first, we didn\u2019t know what was happening. \u00a0We were barely able to see their plan when the previous Demon King\u2019s forces came to the fore. \u00a0This isn\u2019t the current Demon King\u2019s style.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cWhat style of action does the current Demon King prefer?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cInstead of working behind the scenes, he likes to grow his power out in the open. \u00a0He likes to cause fear through an overt display of power.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">If one went only by her words, it was as if she was describing a chimpanzee instead of a Demon King. \u00a0Their current situation didn\u2019t allow them to joke around, so Vadinet decided to keep her mouth shut.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">The one that was the most excited was Roa.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cNyaa-ah, nyaa-nyaa-ah. \u00a0Nyaa nyaa nyaa nyaa nyaa.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">It was never in doubt that she was a cat. \u00a0Her steps were light, soft and quick. \u00a0She sucked in all the Demonic energy that permeated these grounds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">The current Roa was nothing like the past Roa. \u00a0She was quick and precise in picking out only the Demonic energy. \u00a0The Demons didn\u2019t even have the chance to use their magic. \u00a0They fell to the floor before they could even move.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cRoa, don\u2019t let even one of them leave this place.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Etna didn\u2019t personally subdue the Demons. \u00a0She just used her vast magical energy to cover the entire headquarters with a massive heat barrier. \u00a0Nothing could come in or out. \u00a0Any Mana or matter burned when it came in contact with the barrier. \u00a0The headquarters had been isolated. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cYou processed heat to the extreme to create this barrier. \u00a0I never expected such a thing to be possible\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Vadinet had already seen Artpe\u2019s nearly flawless barrier. \u00a0Etna\u2019s way of creating a barrier looked simple and brutish. \u00a0However, she couldn\u2019t see any weak points in the barrier. \u00a0Moreover, it had the ability to differentiate between enemies and allies. \u00a0It implied that she had used spirits in creating the barrier. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t a simple fire.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cHelp Roa.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cRoa is capable of doing this alone\u2026. \u00a0Ah, yes. \u00a0I understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Etna had already shed the body of a Demon. \u00a0However, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable killing other Demons. \u00a0This was why she wanted to be alone, and Vadinet realized this fact. \u00a0She nodded her head as she joined up with Roa.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u2018In the short term, you\u2019ll suffer pain that is worse than death. \u00a0However, I will not kill you all. \u00a0Artpe will revert everything back to their true state, and at that time, he\u2019ll give you guys a choice. \u00a0If there is no changes to your behavior\u2026...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">At that time, she\u2019ll burn all of them with her fire. \u00a0Etna let out a big sigh as she took a step forward. \u00a0Small fire spirits appeared around her. \u00a0They laughed as they followed her movements. \u00a0It seemed they weren\u2019t aware of her feelings.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">The party easily took care of the Seros company\u2019s headquarters. \u00a0They recovered all the Artifacts and Magic Stones. \u00a0Since these items were made for Demons, the items were emitting negative energy. \u00a0However, Roa ruthlessly suck out all the corrupted energy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cNyaa. \u00a0My stomach is full. \u00a0Nyaa.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cThen you shouldn\u2019t reveal so much skin.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cNyaa. \u00a0Nyaa-ah-ah.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Vadinet and Roa bickered with each other as they gathered all the items. \u00a0Roa\u2019s base nature dominated over the Demonic energy. \u00a0This was why Vadinet instinctually had favorable feelings towards Roa. \u00a0She was a rotten holy priestess, but in the end, she was a holy priestess.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cAs expected, they came here\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cMmm?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">While Vadinet and Roa were focused on confiscating the Artifacts and magic stones, Etna was slowly walking down the corridor. \u00a0She was extending her Mana to search her surrounding. \u00a0Vadinet tilted her head in puzzlement when she noticed Etna\u2019s atypical behavior. \u00a0Etna let out a bitter laughter as she answered the unasked question.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cAfter the previous Demon King\u2019s faction started to work in earnest, I wondered if their leaders had visited this place at least once. \u00a0I thought they might have come here to take some of the valuables. \u00a0It seems I was right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">The Seros company was one of the three largest merchant companies on this continent, yet they had significantly less treasures compared to their stature. \u00a0This was why Etna wondered if most of the previous Demon King\u2019s forces had been \u2018supplied\u2019 by the Seros company, and she had been right in her assumption.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">The words spoken by Vadinet and Roa differed from each other, but they both wanted the same thing! \u00a0Etna nodded her head as she replied.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cYes. \u00a0However, I don\u2019t know how many Demons there will be at that location. \u00a0It might be dangerous if we go by ourselves.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cYou brought along Roa and me. \u00a0I thought it was your plan to just charge into their camp.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Etna smirked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cI did so, because I thought there might be a chance that we might find one of their leaders here\u2026. \u00a0 Be careful everyone!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">She cut short her words. \u00a0She quickly raised her Mana as she yelled out. \u00a0The power of the barrier was gathered at a single point. \u00a0Incredible heat was condensed into a single attack. A man appeared as he took on the brunt of this attack.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">[Koohk. \u00a0The barrier is capable of counterattacking by itself\u2026.!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">The man had planned on exterminating the intruders as soon as he appeared. \u00a0However, he hadn\u2019t expected to consume all his prepared Mana in blocking the barrier\u2019s counterattack. \u00a0He rolled across the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">His entrance was poor, but the Mana hidden inside his body was immense! \u00a0Vadinet chanted her holy spell on instinct. \u00a0Roa immediately attacked him!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cFood delivery service, nyaa-ah-ah!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">[Food delivery?

This meant the newly born monsters past the 6th floor had no idea what was going on. \u00a0They would only be linked to the monsters on the same floor, ,and they had to wait until the challengers arrived. \u00a0This would remain so until he canceled what he did to the Record Link. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">So what if\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat would happen if I undid the restriction placed on the Record Link? \u00a0Have you thought about it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe intentionally spoke those words aloud. \u00a0He did it to create an opening.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[What\u2026..?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoohp!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His plan was very effective. \u00a0For a brief moment, it stopped swinging its sword. \u00a0As if she had been waiting for this moment, Maetel kicked off the ground as she leapt towards the Death Knight. \u00a0She stabbed towards its sword. \u00a0A clear sound rang out, and the Death Knight\u2019s sword broke in the middle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Koohk!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Death Knight finally regained its senses. \u00a0It took a half step backwards to regain its stance. \u00a0It pushed its shield slightly forward, and it unsheathed a secondary weapon. \u00a0It gripped the long dagger as it glared at Maetel and Artpe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[What do you think you can accomplish by breaking my sword, hero? \u00a0I\u2019ve already discerned the fact that you are consuming Mana at an alarming rate. \u00a0Also, do you think you can shake me with such words, boy with the rotten eyes? \u00a0There is no way you\u2019ll do something that would only be beneficial to us.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo, you aren\u2019t entirely correct.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Record Link was a skill that brought together the record of everything tied together by the magic. \u00a0It gathered battle experience, skill, magical energy and stamina in one place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Record Link possessed a really big weakness. \u00a0There were multiple reason why this magic spell was banned. \u00a0\u00a0However, this particular weakness was the most fatal and annoying reason of them all.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy do you think I\u2019ve raised this shield up until now? \u00a0If you think hard on it, you might figure it out\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel was breathing roughly as she stoked the rage from within as she fought the Death Knight. \u00a0The Death Knight had no choice, but to retreat. \u00a0It tried to keep calm as it looked for a chance to counterattack. \u00a0Artpe grinned as he looked at the Death Knight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHa! \u00a0Maetel, you should look out for the falling monsters and the upheaval of your surrounding!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had extended several thousand Mana Threads to its limits. \u00a0He had tied off parts of the Record Link to cause change to it. \u00a0He had done this only a year ago. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Now he unravelled all the changes he had caused!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKyahhhhhhhhk!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Did you really\u2026..!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Dungeon shook. \u00a0The Dungeon, which had been separated into floors, was being combined into a single floor in short order! \u00a0The Record Link, which had been tied off into small pieces, was whole again. \u00a0It once again surrounded the entirety of the Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The ceilings that separated the 6th floor to the 35th floor melted away in an instant.

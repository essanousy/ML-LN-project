background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to say that the magic tome and the ruin were one right now. \u00a0Artpe was able to tie them together with his chant! \u00a0He was able to finish the spell without much difficulty. \u00a0According to his will, the Demonic energy in the atmosphere and the Demonic energy within Roa and the Demon \u00a0started to change. \u00a0It happened simultaneously.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Roa relaxed when she felt the Demonic energy, which she hadn\u2019t been able to digest, turn into Mana. \u00a0The Demon felt his existence being twisted. \u00a0He yelled out in shock.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Artpe\u2019s original methodology of using the magic tome had the downside of damaging a large portion of his subject\u2019s Record. \u00a0Since he couldn\u2019t do anything about existing Demonic energy, he had decided to drain all the Demonic energy from his subject. \u00a0He had tried to create a weak point that he could exploit through this method.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, he realized now that he had been wrong. \u00a0Artpe wasn\u2019t supposed to change a Demon into a human. \u00a0He had to restore a Demon into being human again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The secret hidden within the ruin was so foul that it made him sick. \u00a0The previous hero, who was Maetel\u2019s ancestor, knew the truth. \u00a0He had tried to find a way to revert everything back to their original state. \u00a0He had turned himself into a Demon for this cause. \u00a0Artpe had taken a different approach to reach this point. \u00a0He had pursued turning Demons into humans for a different reason than Nanarai Bodra. \u00a0However, his research was able to get him to this point.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The process differed from each other, but their intent was the same. \u00a0The fact that he shared the same emotions with his sunbae was a bit nauseating, but\u2026. \u00a0His sunbae had been right. \u00a0In terms of result, Artpe had also walked on the right path.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Maybe, Artpe had developed his Innate ability over the years to reach this point. \u00a0Maybe, he became a hero for this purpose.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Mmm. \u00a0He was probably overstating it. \u00a0Artpe still wanted to live the quiet and peaceful life of a dairy farmer. \u00a0He wanted to live in peace. \u00a0If possible, he wanted to live that life with those that wanted the same thing as him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He had to perfect this spell for that purpose. \u00a0He\u2019ll combine his accumulated Record with sunbae\u2019s accumulated Record to create a new law of this world!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Artpe was correct. The Demon knew that it was a lost cause to fight the hero\u2019s party within the ruin. \u00a0He couldn\u2019t win against them. \u00a0This was why he gave up on recovering the Evil Heart. \u00a0He chose to retreat for now, so he could live to fight another day.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">[You dirty human filth!

I can feel a strange energy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe had been about to warn Maetel, but she mumbled to herself before he could. \u00a0Her pretty face frowned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe could see Maetel\u2019s ability change in real time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Maetel]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Level 1]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Detection Lv1]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI can feel it more clearly now, Artpe. I\u2019m pretty sure there are beings coming towards us.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7ah, yes. \u00a0I was about to tell you the same thing. \u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, there were also geniuses, who learned high quality Skills, irrespective of their levels. \u00a0This was what had happened to the blonde haired girl in front of him! \u00a0She was a damned genius!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He let out a string of curses in a low voice, and he decided to look at this in a positive light. His only ally was a genius.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThey are goblins. \u00a0They are all level 3. \u00a0If it's a one on one battle, it might be a fair fight. \u00a0However, there are three of them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDon't worry. \u00a0I\u2019ll protect Artpe.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Her words were very heroic! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, she was wearing shabby clothes. \u00a0It probably had a Defense of 0. \u00a0It might even have a negative defense by the look of it. \u00a0She had no other equipments. \u00a0The girl spoke such words, while she clenched her dirty hands into a fist. \u00a0It amplified the worry he felt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStill, you can't fight them with empty hands. \u00a0It is unreasonable, so please be patient.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe let go of Maetel\u2019s helping hands. \u00a0He limped around as he quickly searched his surrounding. \u00a0\u00a0He could see the composition of the world, and the information was pouring in through his eyes. \u00a0He concentrated his efforts in finding the most sharp or hard item he could find. \u00a0Fortunately, his efforts were immediately rewarded.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo. \u00a0This should be fine.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Burning Branch]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[A trace amount of naturally occurring Mana has hardened the fibers and bark of the branch. \u00a0It has the potential to be used as a burning weapon. \u00a0It\u2019ll break after several swings.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sometimes there were artifacts that were naturally formed in nature. \u00a0It was ungainly compared to a crafted weapon, but it was good enough to be used as a stopgap weapon. \u00a0He put the item into Maetel\u2019s hands as he spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTwo is coming diagonally from the left, so you should guard that side.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh? \u00a0This branch feels a bit strange. \u00a0I can feel a hot, yet comfortable feeling from it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe observed Maetel. Sure enough, he saw the newly updated information.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Maetel]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Level - 1]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Mana Sensitivity Lv1]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...yes. \u00a0I see.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI don\u2019t know what just happened, but was it something good?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOf course. \u00a0This is the attainment of a warrior.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This wasn\u2019t something a normal warrior could gain. \u00a0This was the attainment of a high rank warrior! \u00a0Artpe didn\u2019t know how many skills she could awaken by herself. \u00a0He decided not to be surprised from now on. \u00a0He picked up an ordinary rock, and he turned around.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His knee was aching, but he ignored the pain. \u00a0He focused on imbuing Mana into the rock. The only thing he could do right now was to manipulate his Mana.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Mana was basically pure energy. \u00a0When he imbued his Mana into this very plain rock, it would become a useful weapon that he could throw once.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Fortunately, Artpe had a ridiculous amount of Mana considering he was level 1\u2026. \u00a0There was so much that he wondered if his status as a hero had a causal effect. \u00a0He had put in enough Mana to fill the rock, yet he still had plenty left.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The rock was filled with magic, and it started to emit a blue light. \u00a0If he left it be, the Mana would slowly bleed out. \u00a0However, if he threw it, it would cause a weak explosion. \u00a0It was enough to kill a level 3 goblin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cArtpe?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI told you there were three, right? \u00a0Don\u2019t worry about the one coming towards us from our rear. \u00a0You just focus on the ones coming from the front.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou even know where the monsters are coming from. \u00a0Artpe is amazing!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLook towards the front.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one of the bastards had a long distance weapon, they would have to run away. \u00a0However, this was a forest in the boondocks. \u00a0This was a novice zone where goblins weren\u2019t allowed to hold any advanced weapons.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As expected, it didn\u2019t take too long for a laughing goblin to push through the brush. \u00a0The goblins weren\u2019t equipped better than them. \u00a0They just had sturdy looking clubs.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Goo-heh-heh. \u00a0You guys look tasty! \u00a0Guehk!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDie!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was no way he would allow a level 3 small fish pontificate in front of him! \u00a0When the goblin assigned to Artpe came into range, he quickly threw the rock. \u00a0The rock flew true, and the goblin\u2019s head exploded. \u00a0The goblin fell over backwards. \u00a0It was a one shot kill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Kee...kee-eek!?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Weak humans!?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHyahhhhhp!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When their comrade in charge of the ambush died in such a preposterous manner, the goblins were taken aback! \u00a0At that moment, the hero charged. \u00a0Unlike her title as a hero, she had used a cowardly tactic by waiting for an opening!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI feel as if everything will work out if I swing this!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCountless \u00a0gamblers ruined themselves by trusting their instincts!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-ahhhhhp!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Ggoo-ehhhhhhk!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, unlike Artpe worries, the wooden branch swung by Maetel fell with exquisite strength and speed. \u00a0It impacted on the goblin\u2019s arm. \u00a0The goblin dropped it club, and it fell over as it screamed in pain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A level 3 monster was defeated by a level 1 hero! \u00a0This was shameful; event for the entire race of goblins.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Maetel]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Level - 1]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Swordsmanship Lv1]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cArtpe. \u00a0Somehow I feel stronger!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. \u00a0I know. \u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Until now, Maetel had only swung a branch during her roleplay as a hero. \u00a0She didn\u2019t have any real battle experience, yet she learned swordsmanship so easily.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Still, Swordsmanship wasn\u2019t as impressive as the Mana Sensitivity!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe gave an apathetic reply as he picked up another rock.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From just one swing of the branch, Maetel had earned courage and skill. \u00a0She bravely attacked the remaining goblin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cScary monsters! \u00a0Don\u2019t torment Artpe!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Kwahhhhk. \u00a0It is a scary human! \u00a0Ggoo-ehhhhk!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This strike was much stronger than before. \u00a0She was only a level 1, yet she possessed Mana Sensitivity. \u00a0Maetel instinctively brought out the heat from within the wooden branch. \u00a0She burned the goblin\u2019s club, and she hit the goblin's head square in the head!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The goblin couldn\u2019t resist against the terrible pain, and it died. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was hard to tell which one was the scary monster!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Maetel]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Level 2]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Mana Control Lv1]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh. \u00a0Oooh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the fire was brought out from the wooden branch, it consumed all the mana contained within the branch. \u00a0It turned into ash in Maetel\u2019s hand, and the ash was dispersed by the wind. Somehow, it was a sad sight for her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI really killed them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was as if Maetel had poured out all her energy. \u00a0She sat in place as she looked down at her hands.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a very short fight, but she had never experienced something so powerful. \u00a0She had went back and forth between the boundaries of life and death. \u00a0She had ended lives with her hands! \u00a0She wouldn\u2019t be able to forget this shock easily. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe also knew what she was going through. \u00a0He understood it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cArtpe. \u00a0I\u2026. \u00a0\u00a0I won?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe gave a cold reply, and he threw the rock he had pick up a moment ago. \u00a0In a short amount of time, the rock had taken in a lot of Artpe\u2019s Mana. \u00a0The rock brushed near Maetel as it flew by like the wind. \u00a0Before it could swing its club towards Maetel, the goblin\u2019s head exploded.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel saw the goblin\u2019s body stumble to the ground. \u00a0She finally became aware of its presence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKyahhhhk!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou haven\u2019t won until all your enemies are killed. \u00a0You should keep that in mind.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c....I forgot.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The goblin she attacked first had only suffered a broken arm from her first strike. \u00a0It had dropped its club, yet it had remained alive. \u00a0Maetel had forgotten about the first goblin when she faced the other goblin. \u00a0On top of that, she had been intoxicated by the fact that she had killed a goblin. \u00a0The battle hadn\u2019t ended, yet she had been out of it!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel was looking at Artpe blankly. \u00a0He spoke icily towards her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWake up, Maetel. \u00a0We are no longer children, who live within the fences of a village.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cArtpe\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Other 12 year old girls could act like this right now, but a hero didn\u2019t have that luxury. \u00a0Even if Maetel\u2019s goodwill towards him decreased, he wanted her to have a mean streak.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The hero in his previous life was too soft.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had been softer than a cheese matured for half a year!

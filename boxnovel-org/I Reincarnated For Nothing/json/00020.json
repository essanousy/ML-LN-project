\u00a0Maetel always acted daft. \u00a0Artpe let out a sigh, and he lightly flicked her forehead.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet\u2019s loot.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The gazes of Artpe, Maetel and Mycenae headed towards the corpse of the Death Knight.

vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cIt is a trap.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Etna made the assertion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cThe Dungeon was made in a short amount of time, yet an unbelievable amount of work had been put into making it. \u00a0Moreover, there is a message that only Artpe can see. \u00a0It is clear who the Demon King is aiming for! \u00a0That means the current Demon King has already\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">The Demon King had already awakened to the memories of his past life. \u00a0Etna almost blurted those words out. \u00a0She was barely able to swallow it. \u00a0There were those in her present company that didn\u2019t know about this fact. \u00a0She exchanged glances with Artpe as they nodded their heads.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u2018It might be like what happened to Etna. \u00a0Some event might have triggered his awakening. \u00a0It is a possibility. \u00a0Or maybe, the current Demon King met one of the past Four Heavenly Kings after he fought the previous Demon King. \u00a0He might have regained his Record through the Innate Ability called Record Keeping.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">This was very unlikely, but there was also the possibility that the current Demon King had regained his memories much faster than Artpe had realized. \u00a0There was a scenario where the current Demon King had possessed his past life\u2019s memories from the moment Artpe\u2019s Rewrite ability had activated.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u2018No, that doesn\u2019t make any sense. \u00a0If the current Demon King remembered his past life, he wouldn\u2019t have been pushed back so easily by the past Demon King. \u00a0If he lost knowing about his past life, does that mean that the previous Demon King was that powerful?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">The previous hero possessed powerful magical energy, yet he wasn\u2019t able to kill the past Demon King. \u00a0He had been a powerful foe that had to be sealed. \u00a0Maybe, the current Demon King couldn\u2019t do anything despite knowing about the seal being broken. \u00a0It was possible. \u00a0The conflict between the current Demon King\u2019s faction and the past Demon King\u2019s faction might have started from the beginning.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">However, the most important fact was that the current Demon King\u2019s personality had remained the same. \u00a0It was the one that Artpe knew. \u00a0That meant\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cLet\u2019s head in.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">After thinking over it for a long time, Artpe made the declaration. \u00a0For a brief moment, his party members couldn\u2019t process his words. \u00a0They were frozen in place. \u00a0Maetel let out a shout in dismay.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cArtpe!?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cThe bastard said it is the last recipe. \u00a0It means we will become stronger if we enter that place.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cIsn\u2019t it a declaration saying that he\u2019ll eat us after cooking us\u2026.?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Elrick\u2019s worry was well founded, but Artpe snorted as he shook his head from side to side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cThe only thing I\u2019m worried about is the previous Demon King, since he is an unknown foe. \u00a0I\u2019m not afraid of the current Demon King. \u00a0 At our power level, we can take on the current Demon King. \u00a0It\u2019ll be a fair fight.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">At the very least, he wouldn\u2019t have to sacrifice anyone even if they were on the defensive. \u00a0They would be able to run away without losing anyone at their current power level. \u00a0Etna also nodded her head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cThe Demon King can\u2019t simply be judged using his level. \u00a0Of course, that is true for this party too\u2026.. \u00a0Still, we shouldn\u2019t purposefully go into a trap prepared by an enemy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Usually, the hero charged towards danger. \u00a0The hero was like a moth drawn to a flame. \u00a0Up to that point, Artpe\u2019s party had done well in deftly maneuvering through danger. \u00a0Artpe let out a bitter laughter as he answered Etna\u2019s questioning words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cI thought about what the Demon King is thinking right now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cWhat do you mean? \u00a0Isn\u2019t he thinking about destroying the heroes?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cNo. \u00a0He purposefully created the Dungeon on the road to the Demon King\u2019s castle where only I could detect it. \u00a0There is a barrier over it that won\u2019t allow even the previous Demon King to detect it\u2026. \u00a0 It makes me think that something else is going on.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cMmm\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7? \u00a0Wait a moment. \u00a0Are you trying to say the current Demon King doesn\u2019t share the same goal as the past Demon King? \u00a0Is that what you are trying to say?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">The ruling power of the Demon realm had changed hand. \u00a0Artpe had witnessed Petra working on behalf of the previous Demon King\u2019s faction. \u00a0He assumed that all of the Demon realm had fallen into the hands of previous Demon King. \u00a0However, if he thought back on it, he couldn\u2019t find proof that the current Demon King was a follower of the past Demon King.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Moreover, he had appeared in front of Artpe\u2019s party by himself right now. \u00a0The current Demon King had cut all ties with the previous Demon King\u2019s faction, and he had deftly maneuvered to appear in front of Artpe\u2019s party. \u00a0The current Demon King was trying to focus the spotlight on himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">If he just wanted to slaughter the hero\u2019s party, he would have joined up with the previous Demon King. \u00a0He went out of his way to make a splash by himself! \u00a0He truly acted like the Demon King from Artpe\u2019s memories.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u2018The bastard is almost obsessed with the notion of controlling everything. \u00a0That trait is oddly fused with the need to be an exhibitionist. \u00a0Maybe, he\u2026...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">When Artpe was about to come to a conclusion, Silpennon suddenly spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cMaybe, the current Demon King really doesn\u2019t like what has transpired right now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cYou took the words right out of my mouth.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Silpennon had thought about his last moments. \u00a0At the time, the Demon King had spoken these words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">[I never expected myself to be part of the stage.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">His voice had carried anger and annoyance that he couldn\u2019t fully dictate the situation. \u00a0Silpennon clearly remembered it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">[I do not welcome this. \u00a0I do not welcome this. \u00a0This isn\u2019t fun at all.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">What else did he say? \u00a0In Silpennon\u2019s head, he heard the Demon King\u2019s resolute declaration ring out once again. \u00a0His words weren\u2019t directed at him. \u00a0It hadn\u2019t been directed at Maetel either. \u00a0Maybe, it was directed at himself. \u00a0He might have been making a promise to himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">[The degree of completion of this story is lacking. \u00a0It\u2019s a failure. \u00a0The fact that I had to watch all of this up until now had been boring. \u00a0Now I have to dance to the tune of someone else? \u00a0I refuse to do that.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Silpennon raised his head. \u00a0There was only one conclusion he could make.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cThis thought exercise is based on the assumption that the current Demon King is \u00a0a complete psycho.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cHe is a complete psycho.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cHe called it the final recipe. \u00a0Does it mean that he\u2019ll sacrifice himself to make us stronger?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cMmm\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">If it was a holy priest or a holy priestess, one might be able to believe a being was capable of such self-sacrifice. \u00a0However, they were talking about the Demon King right now. \u00a0When the other party members heard Silpennon\u2019s words, they had an expression of slight disgust on their faces. \u00a0Silpennon did his best to convince the others, who looked taken aback by his assertion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cYou should think hard on it. \u00a0It is true that Artpe is such a cheat that everyone in this party grew at an unbelievably rate. \u00a0However, you have to look at it from the perspective of the current Demon King. \u00a0When the past Demon King and his forces appeared, the composition of the fight between the hero and the Demon King was flipped on its head. \u00a0\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cHis stage was destroyed before the match could end. \u00a0Then to add insult to injury, the current Demon King was weaker than the past Demon King, so he was pushed into playing a minor role. \u00a0In such a situation, the only choice he could make\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Artpe spoke instead of Silpennon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cHe\u2019ll help us grow more, so we\u2019ll have a fighting chance against the previous Demon King? \u00a0Is that what you want to say?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">\u201cMoreover, he\u2019ll even sacrifice himself to make this come true!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">In the process of this plan, he would have to voluntarily give himself up. \u00a0That part was psychotic.

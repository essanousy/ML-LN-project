She was even eating the bones. \u00a0\u00a0He couldn\u2019t help but smile. \u00a0He started to eat his own portion of fishes as he spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou have worked hard, Maetel. \u00a0It is true that the Dungeon was very hard, but as a result, we were able to significantly decrease our growth period. \u00a0We\u2019ll be able to move with a little bit more time to spare. \u00a0No, even if you don\u2019t like it, we\u2019ll move at a more leisurely pace. \u00a0I\u2019m really tired and exhausted.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cArtpe\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSay it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel was still unable to calm her heart. \u00a0She sniffed as she asked him a question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you really sure that you don\u2019t like older women?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c..........\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was she still worried about that!? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was dumbfounded. \u00a0He smirked as he shook his head from side to side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you earlier? \u00a0I gave her a little bit of a warning as recompense for the gem we received.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you really sure?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m really sure.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......yes, I\u2019ll believe you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed her worry about Artpe looking at other women overshadowed her psychological uneasiness at killing humans. \u00a0It seemed Artpe wouldn\u2019t have to worry too much about her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe let out a sigh of relief, and he was about to clear away the trash. However, at that moment, Maetel spoke as if she just had an idea.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI want to sleep next to Artpe.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou aren\u2019t a child anymore.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI want to sleep with you. \u00a0You said you\u2019ll grant me any wish I want.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel\u2019s voice was shaking slightly. \u00a0When he heard it, Artpe realized he was under a misconception.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She wasn\u2019t being unnecessarily clingy towards Artpe. \u00a0Her mental state was uneasy. \u00a0Moreover, she was still worried about the thought of Artpe leaving her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c....all right. \u00a0I did say that I\u2019ll grant you a wish, so it can\u2019t be helped.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYa-ho!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He took out a bedroll(5 silvers). \u00a0It was a bit cramped for two people, but he was prepared to go through with it tonight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He gathered some leaves on the ground, and he placed a cloth over it. \u00a0Then he placed the bedroll on top before he lie within it. \u00a0As if she was worried about Artpe going back on his words, she quickly got in. \u00a0She had a satisfied expression on her face as she closed her eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGood night, Artpe.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s cramped and uncomfortable in here, so how can we sleep well\u2026. \u00a0She

worries were let go. \u00a0She was breathing easily as she quickly fell into sleep. \u00a0Artpe was dumbfounded by the sight, but in the end, he let out a bitter laugh as he moved to put her in a more comfortable position.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It feels like I\u2019m raising a kid.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, it may not be too far from the truth. \u00a0Maetel didn\u2019t remember her past life, so she was just a young 13 year old girl. \u00a0If Artpe added in his past life, he had lived for couple hundred years. \u00a0He was a demon that was turned into a hero. \u00a0Sometimes, he felt the disparity between the two lives keenly, and in those moments, he had a hard time breathing. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Still, Artpe liked being with Maetel. \u00a0It was strange, but at times, he felt pleased and full.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t just because she was a talent, who could free Artpe by defeating the Demon King. \u00a0At this point, Artpe had no choice but to accept the fact. \u00a0\u00a0Maetel was fairly\u2026. \u00a0She was quite dear to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was unfortunate that the innocent child was changing. \u00a0She was being stained by his presence. \u00a0However, he was thankful that this small child cherished him, and she wanted him around.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was as if he had committed a sin. \u00a0It felt as if he was slowly being buried under a soft marsh. \u00a0It was as if he was melting away. \u00a0He was afraid to struggle\u2026 \u00a0It was that sweet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Still, I shouldn\u2019t pay too much attention to it. \u00a0I can be complacent after we kill the Demon King..\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yes, he had things to do right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe was careful not to wake Maetel. \u00a0He carefully snuck his hand out of the bedroll, and he activated his magic. \u00a0The Hero\u2019s Unique Spell called Mana String was activated in no time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKook!?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe were found\u2026..!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The five strands of Mana Strings extended out into the surrounding. \u00a0The Mana Strings let out a black light as they danced in the air. \u00a0Red lines of blood bloomed underneath the dark night sky like flowers. \u00a0\u00a0Accompanying dull thudding sounds, human body parts started to fall to the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had been sure that they had succeeded in their stealth mission. \u00a0They paid for this belief with their lives. \u00a0Of course, there were still a lot of them left. \u00a0Artpe would extract a price from all of them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe looked at them with cool eyes, and he spoke with a voice that was colder than a block of ice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShe\u2019s sleeping. \u00a0Be quiet, so she doesn\u2019t wake up.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you to playing games with...kahk!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe clicked his tongue as he watched the men emerge from the darkness. \u00a0He moved his fingers. \u00a0The Mana Strings moved according to his will. \u00a0They moved like whips with sentience, and they split through the air. \u00a0The lives of two to three people were killed in a flash.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe is stronger than the girl\u2026.!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt seems you guys are incapable of learning. \u00a0Don\u2019t you guys realize that you guys are dying in the order of who opened their mouth first?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe\u2019s purple eyes let out a radiant light within the darkness. \u00a0It was as if his eyes could pierce through all lies. \u00a0His eyes only contained the truth. \u00a0The party of men had tried a surprise attack relying on the darkness. \u00a0His eyes was like the deliverer of death for these men.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW...we can\u2019t win.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe one that is terrifying is actually him\u2026. \u00a0Kahk!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Mana String. \u00a0The experience I picked up struggling as a weakling was mixed with the Hero\u2019s power to become a Unique spell\u2026.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t a proper spell. \u00a0The Mana Threads was something he developed during the rough patches of his life as a demon. \u00a0In the beginning , the Mana String was an unwelcome development for him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he was able to quietly take care of this problem thanks to this spell. \u00a0He was able to let Maetel sleep peacefully. \u00a0This single reason was good enough for him to value this magic.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe erred in assessing their capability\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhere are you running away?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Mana String was able to impart overwhelming force using Mana, but it consumed a lot of Mana. This was why it wasn\u2019t a weapon that could be used freely in a battle situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Artpe used all the information coming in through his eyes to find the most efficient trajectories. \u00a0He moved his fingers according to the calculations he had made.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The men tried everything to stop it, but their weapons and feet were slower than the Mana String, which had no weight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWait a moment. \u00a0If you cooperate with us, you will have a place in the newly created kingdom\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGood bye.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The five strands of Mana Strings gathered at a single location. \u00a0The last remaining man was still struggling to live. \u00a0He died as he was cut into several slabs of meat. \u00a0His face was full of resentment. \u00a0Artpe let out a bitter laugh when he saw it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018From your perspective, your side was probably in the absolute right. \u00a0In your next life, I hope you will be able to live a life as a farmer where you won\u2019t have to kill or be killed. \u00a0I will pray for you all.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe retracted the Mana Strings, and he checked Maetel, who was snuggled up against him. \u00a0Her breathing was even. \u00a0She was still asleep.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018That wasn\u2019t too bad.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, it seemed the disturbance wasn\u2019t at an end. \u00a0From not too far away, the main guests were coming towards them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe were discovered, captain! \u00a0If you are done retrieving the gem, you should help\u2026. \u00a0What!?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From the beginning, Artpe hadn\u2019t bothered hiding his location. \u00a0He didn\u2019t have any particular difficulty in dispatching the first group that had ambushed him, and it would be the same for those that had followed behind them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat the hell is\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cImpossible\u2026..!?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had wondered about the identity of the second group, who was drawn towards them like \u00a0moths. \u00a0It was none other than the knights that had accompanied the crown prince Silpennon. There were some amongst them that was suffering from serious wounds. \u00a0Some amongst them had bloated face as if they were suffering under the effects of poison.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Still, they were better off than the men that were killed here. \u00a0They had come here to ask for help, so they hadn\u2019t expected to witness the death of their other party. \u00a0They were extremely surprised.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cY\u2026.you bastard!?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe was wide awake, while Maetel was asleep. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t too difficult to determine, who was the culprit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou guys are too noisy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe only brought out a single strand of Mana String to confront their anger. \u00a0\u00a0These men were like scraps compared to the men that had ambushed Artpe\u2019s party. \u00a0They were maggots, who ran away, because they couldn\u2019t handle a single level 118 knight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBe quiet. \u00a0Forever.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKuhk\u2026..!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Mana String cut through the air. \u00a0Four knights had survived, and they had run away towards this direction. \u00a0He took care of them in six seconds. \u00a0Afterwards, a woman ran into the clearing. \u00a0She had great timing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou bastards! \u00a0You dare to call yourselves knights, who protect the royal family\u2026. \u00a0\u00a0Mmmm!?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShhh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe was still within the bedroll, and he was glaring at the female knight Leseti with narrowed eyes. \u00a0Leseti saw the numerous corpses strewn around the clearing, so she closed her mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was pretty good on the uptake, so she was able to easily identify, who was behind the slaughter.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I had a hunch that he wasn\u2019t normal, but I never expected him to be such an overwhelming force. \u00a0Who is this young man\u2026. \u00a0\u00a0Mmm?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was so scared that she was unable to let out even a squeak under Artpe\u2019s murderous gaze. \u00a0She silently went over the situation when she suddenly had an epiphany.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was an incident near here only a year ago. \u00a0Two heroes had been born in a country village. \u00a0When they disappeared, the whole kingdom had been in an uproar!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Two youths....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were incomprehensibly strong compared to their ages.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Black hair and blonde hair\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAhhhhhhhhhhhhh!?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMmmm, Artpe\u2026...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Leseti couldn\u2019t hold back her exclamation of surprise. \u00a0Maetel opened her eyes. \u00a0Leseti belatedly realized she had made a mistake. \u00a0Artpe sharply raised a finger, and Leseti shut her eyes when she saw it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A brief amount of time had passed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you ok, Artpe?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI wasn\u2019t hurt at all, so you don\u2019t have to touch me constantly. \u00a0I\u2019ll clean this up, so you should keep your eyes close.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'm not going to close my eyes. \u00a0I\u2019m all right now. \u00a0I\u2019ll be fine since Artpe is here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou don\u2019t look fine\u2026. \u00a0All right. \u00a0You do whatever you want.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If she hadn\u2019t seen the corpses everywhere around her, she would have been able to continue her sleep. \u00a0However, once she found about about them, sleep wasn\u2019t an option. \u00a0The two heroes got up from their sleeping place, and they put away the bedroll. \u00a0They started working on cleaning up the corpses strewn about their surrounding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe took all of the equipment that was useful. \u00a0He also took all the silver coins they possessed. \u00a0Maetel gathered the corpses he was done \u2018looting.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cArtpe, why do we have to kill other people?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is the same reason as to why we killed the monsters. \u00a0We all have something we want from each other. \u00a0Everything else is just an excuse. \u00a0The plethora of excuses given for harming living beings are just embellishments.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI see\u2026.. \u00a0\u00a0The act of living is very hard in itself.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe important part is to realize that we have to live within such a world. \u00a0You can respect the lives of other people, but when there is a collision, you have carry through to enforce your way of life.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. \u00a0All right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Thirteen year old brats were talking about philosophical bullshit as they calmly cleared away the corpses. \u00a0What was she supposed to say to them? \u00a0Should she disagree with their views? \u00a0Should she tell them to go read more books?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Leseti was banned from speaking, so she didn\u2019t say anything. \u00a0She continued to raise her two hands as she sat on her knees. \u00a0This was a punishment devised by Artpe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat it. \u00a0Did you gather all of them Maetel?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After Artpe threw all the corpses into the fire, he turned to look at Leseti. \u00a0She still had her arms up as she carried out the order she was given. \u00a0Artpe smirked as he spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYour punishment is at an end. \u00a0You should go back to the crown prince. \u00a0As you probably realize by now, no one will side with you even if you head back towards the palace. \u00a0The two of you should go to a remote village. \u00a0You should live a quiet life, while tending to cows.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKoohk\u2026...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Leseti couldn\u2019t give a proper retort. \u00a0She just groaned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yes, the only thing going for the crown prince was that he was the legitimate heir. \u00a0However, in regards to all other issues, the rebels held the upper hand. \u00a0No one would side with them. \u00a0That was the miserable truth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201dHey\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, a young man pushed past the brush, and he gave a reply instead of Leseti.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you know why there was a rebellion against the Diaz family?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the red haired crown prince Silpennon. \u00a0Of course, Artpe had already sensed him getting close. \u00a0This was why he wasn\u2019t surprised as he gave his reply.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDid they perhaps attack the king on the fact that he wasn\u2019t able to properly take care of the heroes?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are correct. \u00a0Of course, I don\u2019t plan on putting the blame on you guys. \u00a0That incident was merely the trigger. \u00a0My uncle\u2026. \u00a0The duke was a wild beast, who had been waiting for an opportunity to tear into the king. \u00a0If it wasn\u2019t the escape of the heroes, he would have found another reason to start a rebellion\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Silpennon had already come to the same conclusion as

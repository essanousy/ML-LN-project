However, Silpennon was slowly getting a feel for fighting against a large group, so a good fight ensued.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel tilted her head in confusion as she watched the life and death battle between human and Slimes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cArtpe, didn\u2019t the Skeletons retreat when they were at a disadvantage? \u00a0Why do these monsters continue to charge forward?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSilpennon looks beatable compared to us. \u00a0These guys are constantly hungry. \u00a0They\u2019ll keep attacking unless their opponent is stronger than them by a fair amount\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy don\u2019t they eat each other?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The question was very well-timed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSlimes don\u2019t eat those that are from the same race as them. \u00a0However, it isn't prudent to view monsters through common sense. \u00a0An exception always exists.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe gave his explanation as he pointed towards Silpennon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Silpennon had just killed a group of Slime, and he was wiping slime off of his body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEven if they are monsters from the same race, their behavior pattern changes depending on the Dungeon, environmental factors and other variables. \u00a0Amongst the monsters, the change that the Slime undergoes is very well-defined and simple. \u00a0Moreover, most Dungeons evolve to match the behavior patterns of the monsters.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo the Dungeons and monsters live and breathe together?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat\u2019s right. \u00a0Maetel is smart.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-hoot.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a rare praise, so there was a bright smile on Maetel\u2019s face. \u00a0However, the only ones to laugh in an easygoing manner were the heroes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYour explanation makes me feel uneasy\u2026. \u00a0It is as if you are trying to say our mere presence will cause changes in the behavior pattern of the Slimes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Leseti made a pretty sharp observation. When he heard her words, a chill went up Silpennon\u2019s spine. \u00a0He quickly turned towards Artpe to shout at him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI want to leave this crazy place!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is too late. \u00a0It has already started.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After Artpe finished speaking, an ominous sound of Slimes moving across the floor was heard. \u00a0The sound was amplified by several degrees.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Slimes\u2026. \u00a0\u00a0They are retreating?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt isn\u2019t just the monsters. \u00a0The Dungeon is really changing\u2026..!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a room at the end of the hallway that had been sealed. \u00a0The room collapsed. \u00a0It continued onto the next one and so forth. \u00a0When a change occured within a Dungeon, the most common phenomenon to occur was the collapse of the strict boundaries that kept the rooms separate.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It also meant that the Dungeon was becoming more dangerous, and the monsters would become stronger. \u00a0In turn, the reward would also be greater. \u00a0When an adventurer feels the change in the Dungeon, one would have to make a quick decision and act on it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Silpennon had two choices. \u00a0He could go forward or retreat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAs I\u2019ve said before, I\u2019m getting out of here!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI have to express my regret to you. \u00a0There are two type of changes that may occur within a Dungeon. \u00a0There are the Dungeons that allow the adventures to retreat when they desire it. \u00a0Then there are the ones that allow you to come in easily, but it won\u2019t let you go easily.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe pointed back at the sealed entrance of the Dungeon, and he smirked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis Dungeon is the latter type.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Silpennon\u2019s face crumpled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMy god\u2026.. \u00a0Doesn\u2019t this basically impose a death sentence on the adventurers!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you under some kind of delusion? \u00a0Dungeons aren\u2019t here to help develop adventurers. \u00a0The Dungeons aren\u2019t here to give them treasures. \u00a0The Dungeons merely exists. \u00a0The danger and opportunity is distributed equitably to all.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Artpe\u2019s Read All Creation ability allowed him to see what changes were occurring within the Dungeon. \u00a0At its heart, this was a Slime Dungeon. \u00a0Even if it evolved in innovative ways, the only one in danger would be Silpennon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe prerequisites that causes the change in the behavior pattern of the Slimes is very simple. First, the intruders has to be strong enough that the Slime can\u2019t win in a direct confrontation. \u00a0Secondly, the intruder has to show no signs of retreating. \u00a0The intruder has to rush forward continuously. \u00a0Third, there has to be an overwhelming number of Slimes present. \u00a0When all of these conditions are met, they start eating each other to become stronger.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s happening right now!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Silpennon screamed those words out. \u00a0The Slimes were wriggling around, and they were combining to become larger. \u00a0\u00a0Moreover, the walls of the Dungeon continued to collapse. \u00a0The Slimes that were on alert within these rooms came forward. \u00a0They kept rushing towards the Slime that was eating its own brethrens!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOh oh. \u00a0It is rare to see one that can eat so much. \u00a0If we are lucky, this might ratchet up a level.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In many ways, the current situation was good for them. \u00a0First, the Slime Dungeon hadn\u2019t been found yet, so a lot of Slimes had amassed within. \u00a0Their party including Silpennon was overpowered in terms of martial strength(Silpennon would disagree with this point). \u00a0Then there was the massive amount of Mana in reserve that would allow the Dungeon to make changes alongside the monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was how Artpe changed history once again. \u00a0The Slime Dungeon would never be a beginner\u2019s Dungeon from this point forward. \u00a0This was the start of a hellhole that was now under the rule of the evolved Slime!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUp a level? \u00a0What do you mean by up a level? \u00a0Are you perhaps talking about a high rank Class! \u00a0Tell me it ain\u2019t so!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt can't be, your highness. \u00a0As you\u2019ve seen, the Slimes are the lowest ranked monsters that range from level 5 to level 10. \u00a0The probability of these monsters combining to form a monster over level 50 is\u2026...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. \u00a0The Dungeon is collapsing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh-ohhhhhhhhhhhh!?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Once a Slime starts to eat its brethrens, it won\u2019t stop until it\u2019s sure it can eat all of the intruders. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the beginning, Silpennon had driven the Slimes into a frenzy. \u00a0Moreover, Artpe and the other members of his party was also within the Dungeon. The Slime knew it couldn\u2019t beat them with a single floor worth of Slimes, so it started preying on the Slimes on the next floor. \u00a0The Dungeon received its intention, and the Dungeon collapsed the floor!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKyahhhhhk!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKoohk!?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the adventurers, who had found this Dungeon, fell downwards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cArtpe!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTsk!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe swung his hand, and he extended three strands of Mana String. He was at the center as he wrapped Maetel, Leseti and Silpennon with the Mana Strings. \u00a0They safely landed on the Dungeon\u2019s 2nd floor, which was below the collapsed hallway.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Geeeeeeeeee]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Sss-oooooh, sss-oooooooooh]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m starting to hear something!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOh. \u00a0If we are lucky, it might even gain self-awareness. \u00a0Ee-yah. \u00a0There are much more Slimes on the 2nd floor!

\u00a0The party watched the gluttonous Slime. \u00a0It was akin to watching someone else\u2019s house burn down. \u00a0Artpe could see the level of the enormous Slime rise in real time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Big Slime]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Level : 33]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s all right. \u00a0It is still a lousy monster. \u00a0Ah. \u00a0Of course, a single hit will kill you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou should have told me that first!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As if Silpennon had been waiting for such words, he quickly ran towards Leseti. \u00a0Leseti talked about his grave and funeral, but she didn\u2019t really plan on letting him die. \u00a0She let him hide behind her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFor your information, it is an Elite monster now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDon\u2019t we get better rewards for killing Elite monsters?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is also stronger than the monsters at the same level.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Big Slime was well aware of its station. \u00a0It had grown a lot, but it knew it would get cut into pieces by the other humans before it was able to kill the detestable red haired brat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why it wasn't satisfied. \u00a0It kept eating all the Slimes on the 2nd floor. \u00a0In the process, the hidden passages of the Dungeons were revealed, and all kinds of rare Slimes started to pop out. \u00a0These Slimes were much more colorful. \u00a0They either possessed a faint trace of magical energy or they were stickier.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, they became nutrients that fueled the growth of the Big Slime.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Uh. \u00a0In the past, I\u2019ve never heard of a rumor about secret passages inside this Dungeon.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Artpe didn\u2019t search out Dungeons in his past life, so he hadn\u2019t had the chance to use his Read All Creation ability within them. \u00a0Basically, a secret that had never been found in his previous life was revealed to him in the present.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Well, this was only a Slime Dungeon. \u00a0There probably wasn\u2019t anything great\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Goo-ohhhhhh-ohng!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt let out a cry!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s shining!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh. \u00a0I might have been wrong.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The rare Records that wasn\u2019t usually allowed to be accessed by a normal Slime had been gathered in one place. \u00a0The Slime broke through another wall, and it took another step forward. \u00a0The party members saw a very rare sight where a monster reached a high rank class through gaining a high level.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Great Slime]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Level : 50]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEe-yah. \u00a0That one is splendid. \u00a0It reached the status of an Elite Rare monster!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow long are you going to just watch!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHmm.

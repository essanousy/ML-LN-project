\u00a0It stubbornly stuck to him!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTsk. \u00a0It can't be helped. \u00a0You should wear this, Maetel.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat about Artpe\u2026.?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf something I need appears, it won\u2019t matter if you beg or cry. \u00a0I\u2019ll ruthlessly push you away to keep that item. \u00a0So don\u2019t worry about taking this item.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel equipped the bone gauntlet. It was made out of bones, but it was an artifact infused with power magical energy. \u00a0It reduced in size to fit her limbs. \u00a0It wrapped tightly around her wrists and fingers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, if Maetel was unable to handle Mana, she wouldn\u2019t have been able to equip this artifact. However, she was a character, who had been able to bring out fire from the wooden branch at level 1. \u00a0The worries about such a requirement could be omitted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWow. \u00a0This feels incredibly sturdy! \u00a0I can feel it protecting me!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIn truth, the bones are filled with resentment. \u00a0However, if you feel such a sentiment coming from it, who am I to say otherwise?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It looked a bit terrifying, but it was something befitting a warrior. \u00a0Artpe smirked when he saw the animated Maetel, who was excited to have a new equipment. \u00a0Then he gathered the other red bone fragments. \u00a0There were a lot of magical energy stored within the bone fragments, so he could probably create something with them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNext is\u2026 \u00a0Ah. \u00a0It\u2019s the shield.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the Skeleton Warrior held it in its hand, it looked like a one handed bastard sword. \u00a0However, when the 12 year old Maetel held it up, it looked like a claymore. \u00a0The sword looked enormous in her hands. \u00a0Naturally, she couldn\u2019t afford to hold the shield alongside the sword.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI don\u2019t want a shield!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is an artifact too. \u00a0If you attack an enemy with the corner edge of the shield, it inflicts a weakening curse\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Warrior hadn\u2019t had the chance to use its shield, but this artifact was much better than the bastard sword! \u00a0The Skeleton Warrior probably blew a fuse when it wasn't able to use the shield. \u00a0On top of that, a crack had even formed on the shield. \u00a0Of course, that wasn\u2019t Artpe\u2019s problem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since she couldn\u2019t carry it around with her hands, he proposed an idea where he would strap the shield to her back. \u00a0However, Maetel hated that idea. \u00a0It would slow her down if the heavy shield was strapped to her back. \u00a0It would be better for her to preserve her speed, so she could evade the enemy\u2019s attack. \u00a0Still, it was a waste to just throw away the shield\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTsk. \u00a0It can\u2019t be helped. \u00a0It\u2019ll be a worse option than you using it, but\u2026. \u00a0I\u2019ll use it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, Artpe equipped the shield on his back. \u00a0He had gathered strips of leather as he went through the Dungeon, and he had infused Mana to strengthen them. \u00a0He created a hole on each side of the shield, and he threaded the strip of leather through the holes. \u00a0One end of the strap was brought over his left shoulder and the other end was brought underneath his right armpit. \u00a0He tied it off. \u00a0Artpe looked like a turtle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel gently screwed up her eyes as she looked at Artpe move around.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are usually slow, but now you became much slower.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere is a reason why I\u2019m carrying it like this. \u00a0I\u2019ll move around slowly, but at the most crucial moment, I\u2019ll unravel the straps. \u00a0Boom! \u00a0The heavy shield will let out a loud sound as it falls to the floor. \u00a0It will startle our opponent.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAht! \u00a0That\u2019s amazing! \u00a0It\u2019ll look very cool!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf I drop it on a surface that breaks into fragments like marble slabs, the visual effect would be twice as more effective. \u00a0You should remember this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had gathered everything that needed to be gathered. \u00a0They had to once again travel from the 1st floor to the 6th floor. \u00a0On the way down, they had to defeat the losers, who had given up on chasing them. \u00a0These were the Skeletons, who broke away from the Skeleton Warrior. \u00a0It would be easy to crush them, and the two of them tried to do just that.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They tried.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSomething has changed, Artpe.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are right. \u00a0Something has clearly changed.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everything was the same until the 5th floor. \u00a0It was the Dungeon they remembered. \u00a0The staircases were still broken, and the Skeletons were heaped up in a pile like pieces of trash to bridge the floors. \u00a0The poor Skeletons were barely alive.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As an act of mercy and a way to increase the party\u2019s level, they killed all the Skeletons in the pile as they descended each floor. \u00a0However, when they stood in front of the staircase leading towards the 6th floor, the two heroes finally realized something was wrong.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis\u2026. \u00a0\u00a0It is made out of marble.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe mumbled in an agitated manner. \u00a0Artpe took in the sight of a long and wide staircase. \u00a0He was sure he had destroyed this staircase before when he went up to the 5th floor. \u00a0Moreover, the staircase had evolved!? \u00a0It was now made out of marble. \u00a0Then there was the large hallway that was absent from his memories!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMarble? \u00a0So Artpe is going to drop your shield here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ve only been carrying this for an hour.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Warrior, who was basically the ruler of the 6th floor, had been killed. \u00a0It seemed the Dungeon had gone through a fundamental change. \u00a0He regretted the fact that he hadn\u2019t been able to use his Read All Creation ability on the Skeleton Warrior before it died.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m looking at it with my Read All Creation ability, but\u2026. \u00a0That\u2019s to be expected.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His Read All Creation ability was able to reveal all secrets, but he was just observing the marbles that made up the Dungeon. \u00a0He couldn\u2019t gain all information regarding the Dungeon through this method. \u00a0It might be possible if he went into the deepest part of the Dungeon to observe the Dungeon's Core. \u00a0Maetel carefully asked a question as she looked at Artpe\u2019s dismayed expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat shall we do, Artpe?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe\u2019ve already decided what we\u2019ll do. \u00a0We are moving forward.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......yes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHowever, you shouldn\u2019t relax too much. \u00a0The traps are now gone, but that might actually mean\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was now afraid of the monsters that\u2019ll appear inside the Dungeon from now on. \u00a0The traps weren\u2019t being deployed to whittle down the adventurers anymore. \u00a0It meant that there would be numerous monsters powerful enough to take down the adventurers without the help of traps.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI don't care what comes out. \u00a0I\u2019ll most definitely protect Artpe.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou don\u2019t need to put on such a grim expression... \u00a0Whatever.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They hardened their resolves as they descended down the marble staircase. \u00a0They entered a completely different 6th floor, and there weren\u2019t any monsters in the front. \u00a0It was the same in the middle part. \u00a0They kept checking their surrounding as they nervously went down the hallway. \u00a0After an indeterminate amount of time, they had reached the location where they had met the Elite Skeleton Warrior.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Up until now, the marble floor held nothing. \u00a0However, four white skulled Skeletons popped up from the floor. \u00a0They were colored the same as the marble floor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Do you want to go forward?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Do you want to retreat?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Do you want to protect?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Do you want to cut?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStep back, Artpe!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m already doing that, so you don\u2019t have to say it!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were mere Skeletons, yet they were wearing pretty good leather armor. \u00a0They also carried gleaming longswords. \u00a0They moved as if they had coordinated a plan beforehand. \u00a0They approached Maetel from both sides. \u00a0Artpe used his Read All Creation ability, and he moaned when he realized the monsters were all close to being level 50.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe difficulty of the Dungeon rose sharply\u2026..!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s all right\u2026 \u00a0I can do this now!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel used her ridiculously fast reflexes and her good eyesight. \u00a0She was doing it at a very slim margin, but she deflected all four longswords in order. \u00a0Then she retreated a little bit, and she hardened her expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHmmph!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the next moment, the Bone Gauntlet let out a faint red light, and it added strength to Maetel\u2019s slim arms. \u00a0Artpe had explained to her that a boost in her emotions could bring out the ability of the artifact. \u00a0However, he had never expected her to be able to control her emotions so freely!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was well aware of her talent, yet even he was overwhelmed by this sight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m going!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You move forward.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You try to protect someone.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Your mental vision is still narrow.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You have enough courage to be recognized.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShuuuuuuuut upppppppp!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel bravely swung her bastard sword, and it impacted on the longsword of the Skeleton nearest her. \u00a0The bastard sword easily broke the longsword in half.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She used her momentum to plant her right foot into the ground as she spun. \u00a0She struck the Skeleton\u2019s body with her forearm. \u00a0When the Skeleton felt the weight of its longsword disappear, it lost its balance. \u00a0The strike sent the Skeleton towards its comrades, who was also swinging their longswords. \u00a0The longswords impacted on the body of the first Skeleton.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, unlike the Elite Skeleton Warrior from before, these Skeletons gave praise even as they suffered under her attack.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You have the wisdom to use the enemy\u2019s power against them.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Your ability to make quick judgement is admirable.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEh-eet.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe wouldn\u2019t just standby as the bastards gave their monologue! \u00a0When the Skeletons got in each other\u2019s way, Artpe didn\u2019t miss the opportunity. \u00a0He attacked them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was overflowing with weapons he could throw! \u00a0He had used all the Mana he had gained when he reached level 30. \u00a0He had reinforced the daggers and bone fragments. \u00a0He threw them towards the Skeletons, who were attacking Maetel. \u00a0He stopped them in their tracks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Kooh-ahk!?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[However, you don\u2019t play fair. \u00a0You hide in safety as you stick out your tongue!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe four of you are attacking her, yet you are talking about fairness? \u00a0Are you trying to test the hero or are you trying to scout for the Demon King\u2019s army? \u00a0Huh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In his previous life, he had been exceptionally skilled. \u00a0After entering this Dungeon, he had only done one thing. \u00a0His ability to throw items were on a whole different level now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His thrown weapons all embedded themselves in their weak points. \u00a0His timing was exquisite. \u00a0He was able to stop the movements of his enemies. \u00a0In terms of throwing skills, he was so skilled that a thief might not be needed for this party. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His main job was supposed to be a magician!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018When I became a hero, it seems I unnecessarily picked up abilities of other disciplines\u2026.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a good thing, so why was he sighing?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was sure of this, but if he checked his Read All Creation ability, his throw skill probably exceeded level 8. \u00a0It was something very incredible, since Maetel\u2019s Swordsmanship skill remained at level 6!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I accept my loss, but before you defeat the others\u2026. \u00a0Kook]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOne down!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While Artpe became confused about his own identity, Maetel had finally taken down a Skeleton. \u00a0One was defeated, yet the EXP of the two heroes didn\u2019t rise.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. \u00a0Let\u2019s take care of the rest\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Your tribulation will start now.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThey are speaking some bullshit, Maetel\u2026 \u00a0\u00a0Huh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Artpe\u2019s Read All Creation ability was activated.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was as if the fallen Skeleton hadn\u2019t existed in the first place. \u00a0The fallen Skeleton melted into the void, and the energy from it was split threeways. \u00a0It flowed into the three remaining Skeletons. \u00a0As this occurred, Artpe was seeing a live update on what was occuring.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Experience Record Strength Mana Transfer]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Evolution Test Task Status]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At a glance, the words looked to have nothing to do with each other. \u00a0It looked to be a list of words. \u00a0However, it was enough of a clue for Artpe to realize what was going on!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShit\u2026.! \u00a0Step aside for a little bit, Maetel! \u00a0The stone and nature proceeds to return to stone and nature! \u00a0It will be beyond one\u2019s reach!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He desperately chanted his magic spell. \u00a0The three Skeletons were attacking a bit faster than before when the marble floor turned slippery. \u00a0They fell to the floor. \u00a0Artpe didn\u2019t stop there. \u00a0He started unraveling the leather strap tying the shield to his back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cArtpe!?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you how I\u2019ll use this earlier, Maetel?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI lied!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe grabbed the end of the strap and he swung it. \u00a0High quality Mana was emitted from his heart, and it flowed down through the strap. \u00a0The Mana flowed into the shield. \u00a0This task was arduous for him even if he was using both hands. \u00a0In a flash, he sent the shield flying forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The shield flew in an exquisite trajectory. \u00a0Artpe\u2019s Mana within the shield was letting out a ominous light. \u00a0the Skeletons were getting up when the shield hit them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Koo-ahhhhhhhk!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You are cheap! \u00a0You are a coward!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m less cheap than you guys, you assholes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe had reinforced the shield with his magical energy, and it had brilliantly caused a curse to be afflicted on the Skeletons. \u00a0It was a simple curse that slowed down the movement of the enemies, but it was like a blessing that allowed them to turn the table of the battle! \u00a0This was especially true when one considered Maetel\u2019s quick movements.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel\u2019s eyes shone as she tried to finish them off. \u00a0Artpe became frightened as he stopped her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDon\u2019t kill them!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf we kill them, the other monsters will become strengthened. \u00a0A Record Link was placed on all the monsters within this Dungeon!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span

\u00a0The \u2018Record Link\u2019 was a sophisticated trap that would unfold from now on. \u00a0The thought it made him grind his teeth!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAnyways, the curse was

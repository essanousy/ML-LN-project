Artpe was oblivious to the fact that Etna was having such shameful thoughts about him. \u00a0He started to control the white hand in earnest.</span></p><br/><p><span>He was controlling it, yet he was no longer consuming any Mana. \u00a0The spell was already complete. \u00a0The only thing left was to deliver his will to the hand. \u00a0He had to order it as its rightful owner.</span></p><br/><p><span>[Koo-goo-ga-ga-ga-ga-ahhhhhhhhh!]</span></p><br/><p><span>He ordered it to drive out the rotten Demonic energy!</span></p><br/><p><span>The white hand started to push back against the hand of the Demonic god. \u00a0The hand of the Demonic god tried to use its Innate ability to destroy the white hand, but the power possessed by white hand neutralized the power of destruction.</span></p><br/><p><span>In fact, the hand of the Demonic god was being pushed backwards as time passed. \u00a0This was happening, because Maetel and Sienna was destroying the arm of the Demonic god. \u00a0They were destroying the source of the Demonic energy.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou really copied its Innate ability\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI learned a concept, and I materialized it. \u00a0I was dubious as to whether it would work.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe\u2019s explanation was simple, but it sounded preposterous to those that heard it. \u00a0He was able to see an Innate ability as a concept, and he was able to learn it. \u00a0First, one needed the Read All Creation ability to do this. \u00a0Even if Artpe was able to learn it, there was the problem of Materializing it. \u00a0Basically, this was something only Artpe could do.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAs expected, I think I\u2019m the main character.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDon\u2019t say such nonsense with a straight face.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI think I understand what the Demon King was talking about\u2026....\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The Demon King was well acquainted with Artpe\u2019s Read All Creation ability. \u00a0In Artpe\u2019s lifetime, the Demon King had been most jealous of his ability. \u00a0This was why the Demon King wanted Artpe to experience facing a part of the Demonic god. \u00a0The Demon King had a hunch that such an incident would help raise up Artpe.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018That damned chef\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>It really was frustrating, but in the end, the Demon King had finished his recipe. \u00a0It was perfect He had to acknowledge that fact.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNyaa-ah!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Roa had been sucking up the Demonic energy up until now. \u00a0She finally stepped forward after it was confirmed that the Demonic god\u2019s hand was being held in place by the hand made by Artpe. \u00a0She quickly closed the distance. \u00a0She bit the end of the Demonic god\u2019s arm, which was being assaulted by Maetel and Sienna.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNyaa-ah-ah-ahhhh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>She started to absorb its power with all her might!</span></p><br/><p><span>[Kyahhhhhhhh! \u00a0Koo-ga-ga-ga-ga-koo-koo-koo-koo-ka-ga-ga-gahk!]</span></p><br/><p><span>Its scream suddenly became ragged. \u00a0This wasn\u2019t a simple attack where it was being destroyed. \u00a0It was being eaten! \u00a0The sensation was entirely different! \u00a0However, the arm didn\u2019t have any offensive capability. \u00a0It could do nothing.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cMaetel! \u00a0Sienna! \u00a0You can attack the hand now!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNyaa-ah! \u00a0I can eat all of this, nyaa-ah-ah!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Roa kept biting into the arm. \u00a0Roa looked the happiest when she was eating. \u00a0Maetel and Sienna attacked the hand of the Demonic god. \u00a0All of its attack and ability was focused on the white hand, so it was easier for them to attack the hand.</span></p><br/><p><span>[Kyaa-ha! \u00a0Kyah-goo-goo-ga-ga-ga! \u00a0Kee-heeeeee!]</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKeep pushing! \u00a0We can\u2019t give it any time to do something else!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He was giving those orders to Maetel and Sienna, but he was also making assurances to himself. \u00a0It was as if the white hand had a consciousness. \u00a0At Artpe\u2019s words, it grew in size, and it started to attack the other hand more fiercely. \u00a0It started to push the Demonic god\u2019s hand with its own perfected destructive ability. \u00a0It looked as if the god of the heavens was directly punishing the Demonic god.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt should feel familiar. \u00a0I added Sienna\u2019s Mana and the power of the Hero\u2019s Flash on top of the holy energy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou are able to tie all of those power into one\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>At this point, she gave up on being surprised. \u00a0The god\u2019s hand was born through a miracle. \u00a0Etna made a fervent wish that it wouldn\u2019t disappear before it defeated the Demonic god\u2019s hand.</span></p><br/><p><span>How long did this persist?</span></p><br/><p><span>At some point, the Demonic god\u2019s hand noticeably started to move slower. \u00a0 The Demonic god\u2019s arm was no longer in existence. \u00a0The black arm with the stump had been around 10 meters long, yet Roa had eaten it all.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNyaa-ah. \u00a0Main dish.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Roa disregarded her swollen up stomach as she balled up her fists.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI can\u2019t fall over before I eat that thing \u00a0Nyaa-ah.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGo, cat-piggy! \u00a0Eat it all!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNyaa-ahhhhhhhh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>[Koo-ga-ga-ga-ga-gahk-ga-ga-ga-ga-gahk!]</span></p><br/><p><span>As the predator got nearer, the Demonic god\u2019s hand used up its remaining reservoir of power for its last struggle. \u00a0Artpe firmly nodded his head as he used another spell. \u00a0The Demonic god\u2019s power, which had spread into the surrounding, started to thin out. \u00a0Etna was by his side, so she immediately realized what he was doing.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou added the power of the Reclamation magic to it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCorrect.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The staff had finished its task. \u00a0It slowly descended from the air, and it returned to Artpe\u2019s possession. \u00a0The resonance between the staff and Artpe had ended. \u00a0The magic tome was still letting out a faint light, and he had focused its power into the white hand.</span></p><br/><p><span>[Koo-ha\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u00a0Kee-goo-goohk\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u00a0Goo-goo-ga-ga-gahk\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7!]</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNyaa\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u00a0Nyaa-ahhhhhhhhhh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Roa bit the finger of the Demonic god. \u00a0The large finger let out an enormous amount of Demonic energy as it tried to dislodge Roa. \u00a0However, Roa remained unaffected. \u00a0Roa was trying to eat as much Demonic energy before the hand\u2019s Demonic energy was converted to Mana through the Reclamation magic. \u00a0She ramped up her attack</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis is the end!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHoo-ahhhhhhhhhhp!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Maetel brought down her bastard sword, and she severed two fingers. \u00a0Roa immediately swallowed up the fingers. \u00a0Sienna brought down fierce hammer strikes, so the hand couldn\u2019t resist any further.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNyaa-ah, nyaa-ahhhhhhhhh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Roa opened her mouth wide. \u00a0An incredible amount of suction pulled the entire hand into her. \u00a0She swallowed everything.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGgoo-oohk. \u00a0I ate it all. \u00a0Nyaa-ah-ah.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>She had an extremely satisfied expression on her face as she stretched out on the floor of the cave. \u00a0Afterwards, every member of Artpe\u2019s party felt an extreme headache. \u00a0They had defeated a Record from a foreign dimension that shouldn\u2019t have been here in the first place. \u00a0After they received the Achievement from defeating the foreign entity, Artpe\u2019s party was able to grow. \u00a0As always, the process was painful.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGgoo-ooooooh\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u00a0Shit! \u00a0 We don\u2019t have the luxury of being able to sit here and work through this pain! \u00a0The cave is collapsing!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cEnd the link! \u00a0This will be painful, but everyone has to get up!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cArtpe! \u00a0Gather around Artpe! \u00a0Hurry!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Artpe was in a desperate situation, yet he continued to move his hands as he gathered all the loot. \u00a0There were some items left behind by the Demon King, but he didn\u2019t have the time to examine them! \u00a0He just gathered everything!</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cEveryone is gathered. \u00a0Let\u2019s go! \u00a0Blink!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They were quite fortunate in the fact that none of them had died after the hard fought battles. \u00a0After defeating the Demon King, they had to fight the fragment of the Demonic god. \u00a0The fights had pretty much wrecked the cave, and it was collapsing on itself. \u00a0At this point, the party was spent physically and mentally. \u00a0The enormous level ups couldn\u2019t heal their tired souls.</span></p><br/><p><span>Anyways, they had somehow won.</span></p><br/><p><span>They had survived.</span></p><br/><p><span>When the party recovered their senses, they were in the middle of the Demon realm. \u00a0The nearby region was packed with Demons.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cW...what the hell is this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAh. \u00a0I see. \u00a0The Demon King had used his full power, and the fragment of the Demonic god had appeared in this place. \u00a0Of course, the Demons would react to such an event.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It had been the mother of all aggro. \u00a0Pretty much all the Demons left in the Demon realm had gathered at this location. \u00a0If given a little more time, the Demonic beasts and even some of the Demons that were in the human realm might be drawn to this place.</span></p><br/><p><span>The most important thing right now was the previous Demon King. \u00a0The previous Demon King probably felt the death of the current Demon King. \u00a0It would be obvious as to who the culprits were. \u00a0The previous Demon King would probably stop his conquest of the human realm. \u00a0It was obvious as to who would be the biggest stumbling block to his Demonification of the human realm would be.</span></p><br/><p><span>Suddenly, Sienna tilted her head in puzzlement. \u00a0There were countless Demons around them, but they weren\u2019t acknowledging the presence of Artpe\u2019s party.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh? Why can\u2019t they see us?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019m using Assimilation right now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The one to answer Sienna was Aria. \u00a0She was still suffering under the aftereffects of the level ups. \u00a0Despite her pain, she had protected her party members with her Innate ability. \u00a0She had been able to increase the range of her Assimilation ability. \u00a0She was able to include her party members now. \u00a0 It really brought home the fact that she had developed into a fantastic party member.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAria, amazing\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cLet\u2019s move to a safe place. \u00a0We have to carry out our plan in haste, but we desperately need to rest right now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Everyone nodded their heads at Artpe\u2019s words. \u00a0He inwardly nodded his head as he observed his party members.</span></p><br/><p><span>He thought it was time for him to tell his party members everything about himself.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

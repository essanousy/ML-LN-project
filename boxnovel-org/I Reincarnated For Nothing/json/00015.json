15 - The Link Between You and I (3)</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHello, adventurers. \u00a0I was dispatched by the Anywhere company. \u00a0I am here to help your Dungeon exploration be as smooth and pleasant of an experience as it can be. \u00a0I am a middleman. \u00a0My name is Mycenae!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had smooth brown skin, and a notably ample bosom. \u00a0The beautiful woman\u2019s voice was clear as if a bell was ringing. \u00a0She waved her hand as she spoke towards Artpe and Maetel.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel instinctively pushed Artpe behind her, and she was about to raise her sword. \u00a0Artpe smirked as he placed his hand on her shoulder.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShe isn\u2019t an enemy, so don\u2019t worry about it. \u00a0According to their contract, they aren\u2019t allowed to attack us first.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cContract?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is a contract made with the god. \u00a0It is sometimes called the Dungeon contract. \u00a0Anyways, it is a contract that no one can break, so you don\u2019t have to worry about it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cArtpe even knows about that. \u00a0You are really amazing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOh my. \u00a0Do you know about the Anywhere company?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She surmised they were out of the ordinary, since the two kids were able to reach the depths of this Dungeon. \u00a0However, she never expected him to have some general knowledge about her store!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Mycenae, who was the middleman from the Anywhere company, looked at Artpe with round eyes. \u00a0Artpe snorted as he waved his hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow dare you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Several dozen Mana threads were emitted from both sides, and they crossed paths. \u00a0There weren\u2019t any ill-intention behind her use of Mana, but it was indiscriminately broken up as it dissipated. \u00a0He was able to declare this his words with impudence. \u00a0All detection and inquiry magic was useless under his Read All Creation ability!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOh my!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDon\u2019t you try to get cute with me, merchant.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Mycenae realized that her inquiry magic had been denied before it could even activate. \u00a0She backed away in fright. \u00a0She backed into the cart, and her bosom jiggled as if it was about to spill out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Every man, who had the strength to raise a spoon, would have been instinctively drawn to her charming gesture. \u00a0However, Artpe just spit on the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoong. \u00a0You are an ajumma.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW...what did you just say!?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou should be prepared to give us a 20% discount, ajumma. \u00a0If you were able pull it off in secret, it would be fine. \u00a0However, you have no excuse, since I found out. \u00a0Right?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKook\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had been a middleman for the Anywhere company for the past 100 years. \u00a0She was a veteran of this industry. \u00a0She never expected to be humiliated in her first meeting with this brat! \u00a0Mycenae balled up her fist as they trembled. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe turned his gaze away from her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His gaze reached the two Skeletons, who had been enhanced to the extreme. \u00a0Only pile of bone dusts was left behind as remains.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. \u00a0Let\u2019s do our looting first.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh, customer?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe\u2019ll trade with you. \u00a0Just wait there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if she set aside the brusque little man, the girl had completely ignored her. \u00a0She felt a large crack form in her pride.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Who the hell were they! \u00a0Unlike their appearances, why were they giving off a vibe of 20 year veteran Dungeon explorers!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere really is only powders left behind. \u00a0Still, it isn\u2019t as if there are no other way to\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI tried to loot, but it didn\u2019t work. \u00a0What should I do in such a situation, Artpe?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. \u00a0I\u2019ll teach it to you, so you should pay close attention.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even as Mycenae's body shook, Artpe approached the two pile of bone dusts, and he extended his Mana Threads in abundance. \u00a0Maetel stood by his side, and her head was tilted in confusion. \u00a0He gave a friendly explanation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOf course, it does seem impossible to loot a monster that had been completely pulverized, but this isn\u2019t the case if you have the ability to control Mana. \u00a0Watch me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Mana Threads extended out of his hand, and they reached the two piles of bone dusts made out of two Skeletons. \u00a0The piles reacted to the Mana Threads, and it started to clump into a single pile. \u00a0Artpe moved his hand in various directions, and the process accelerated.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNext, you have to do this\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWow.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he severed the Mana Threads, the debris also stopped moving. \u00a0It looked like a pile of ash. \u00a0It was as if a vampire had been burned to death there.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe just have to wait for the chosen items to come out. \u00a0This is an easy method you can use if you acted rashly by burning remains of a monster. \u00a0You should keep that in mind.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAs expected, Artpe is amazing!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThese customers are\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This Dungeon had been appealing enough to call her forth. \u00a0The fact that these young adventurers were able to last inside this place was surprising, but it was much more surprising to see one of them use such advanced technique to loot the monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While Mycenae was gawking at them, the looting process was coming to a end. \u00a0It looked to be successful.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, Artpe. \u00a0Something is emerging.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is an arm warmer. \u00a0Since you have the gauntlets, this one is mine.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWow. \u00a0A pretty crystal also came out!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere were too much excess magical energy from monsters gathered here. \u00a0Since it couldn\u2019t be collected naturally, it clumped together. \u00a0Normally, it is used as ingredient for making magical tools. \u00a0Mmmm. \u00a0\u00a0This isn\u2019t an item that you can use\u2026....\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cArtpe can have it all. \u00a0I have the sword and the armor.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Mmm. \u00a0She was like an unwavering angel. \u00a0Artpe let out a bitter laugh as he put the crystal away. \u00a0Then he put on the arm warmers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was unknown as to why arm warmers made out of black leather was dropped by a Skeleton, but when he equipped it, it had a supplemental effect of increasing his hand speed. \u00a0\u00a0It wasn\u2019t intentional, but this was the ideal equipment for Artpe, who had to use both his hands for battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI can see something still shining there, Artpe.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. \u00a0I almost forgot about it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since all the drops of Skeletons on this floor was gathered in one place, there would also be some money mixed inside the loot. \u00a0\u00a0He saw two pretty large gold coins. \u00a0Artpe smirked as he picked them up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI anticipated a gold coin would come out, but I didn\u2019t expect two. \u00a0Nice.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWahhhhh. \u00a0They are pretty.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the first time Maetel had seen gold coins in her lifetime. \u00a0Her eyes twinkled as she let out an exclamation. \u00a0A gold coin was worth 100 times more than a silver coin. \u00a0This wasn\u2019t something unique to Maetel. \u00a0Even their town\u2019s chief would never be able to possess one in his lifetime.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNormally, not all monsters over level 100 drop gold coins. \u00a0This miraculous event occurred, because all our enemies were tied together by the Record Link. \u00a0You should keep that in mind.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWait a moment, customer. \u00a0Record Link? \u00a0What is that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if she was a veteran middleman for the Dungeons, this didn\u2019t mean she knew everything about ancient magic. \u00a0Of course, Artpe didn\u2019t answer the merchant\u2019s question. \u00a0He finished his looting.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe didn\u2019t gain any rewards that we can liquidate\u2026. \u00a0Still, if we add the gold coins to the money we already have, I might be able manage a decent trade.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWait a moment.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After Artpe made sure there weren\u2019t anything else he could take, he walked towards the Dungeon merchant he had been ignoring up until now. \u00a0He moved towards Mycenae. \u00a0Mycenae acted as if she had forgotten about the affront of being ignored up until now. \u00a0She greeted him with a bright smile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWelcome, customer. \u00a0Are you looking for a specific item?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOne empty bottle\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cY\u2026you want an empty bottle?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Mycenae and Artpe made eye contact. \u00a0She tried her best to discern Artpe\u2019s inner thoughts, but he kept a sickeningly innocent expression on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She knew he was up to something. \u00a0However, a member of the Anywhere company couldn\u2019t turn down a trade unless there was a special circumstance involved! \u00a0It was the biggest taboo to turn down a trade! \u00a0Mycenae felt uneasy as she took out an empty bottle from her cart.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe price is 50 bronze coins.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is only a single empty bottle! \u00a0Why is it so expensive!?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll Dungeon merchants are like this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe ignored Maetel, who was shocked. \u00a0He took the empty bottle. \u00a0Mycenae watched Artpe unstopper the bottle. \u00a0She spoke with a worried tone in her voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt seems you are trying to fill up the bottle with the water from the fountain. \u00a0Shouldn\u2019t you check if the water is safe to drink first? \u00a0It is a fundamental rule followed by all adventurers.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI know. \u00a0I already checked it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou already checked it!?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt originates in my heart to manifest in the shallow floor of the water. \u00a0Peel off your despicable outer layer to reveal what lies inside!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW...what the hell!?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While the middleman Mycenae expressed her dismay, Artpe finished his chant. \u00a0It caused an enormous amount of friction to form at the middle of the fountain!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWa-ha-ha-ha. \u00a0The water is boiling!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat\u2019s right. \u00a0I\u2019m wastefully using my Mana!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Hyper Rubbing spell was causing so much friction that it was vaporizing the cold water. \u00a0He was now over level 40, and he was getting used to forming the Hyper Rubbing spell. \u00a0The effectiveness of the magic was on a different level compared to before.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKyahhhhk, customer. \u00a0If the water holds poison, it\u2019ll turn into a poisonous fog!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI already checked it!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The steam covered them completely, but there was no poison within it. \u00a0There were some poison that dissolved entirely in water, and it could have been vaporized alongside the water. \u00a0On the other hand, there were poisons that didn\u2019t mix with the water. \u00a0It would be left behind in place as sediment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the poison within the fountain was the latter type. \u00a0This was why Artpe didn\u2019t hesitate to evaporate the water.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is the first time I\u2019ve heard of such a spell. \u00a0If you wanted to boil the water, couldn\u2019t you have just used a fire type magic?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI did it, because I don\u2019t have such magic!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m currently selling the Boil spell for two gold. \u00a0The fire spell is being sold at a great price of 1 gold!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI won\u2019t buy it!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were a lot of water inside the fountain, so it took a good amount of time for all of it to evaporate. \u00a0After a long wait, the result came to fruition. \u00a0The copious amount of water inside the water fountain had all evaporated, and on the floor, a dark green powder was left behind in a lump.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHmmph.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe smirked when he saw Mycenae unconsciously let out a moan. \u00a0He put the powder into the empty bottle. \u00a0Of course, the identity of the powder was a form of poison. \u00a0It was fine to touch it with one\u2019s bare hands. \u00a0Its toxicity appeared only when it was mixed with a liquid, so it was safe to touch it right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, are you going to buy this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe didn\u2019t leave a single grain of the green powder behind. \u00a0He stoppered the bottle, and he pushed it towards Mycenae. \u00a0Her cheeks were puffed up as she started to argue with Artpe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c.......so you already know why the Dungeon Merchants appear in Dungeons?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOf course. \u00a0You guys have designs on acquiring magical goods.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When adventurers explore a Dungeon, they face danger and opportunity prepared by the Dungeon. \u00a0One might find a hidden treasure box, a poisoned fountain or a pond made out of the highest quality holy water.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was possible for the Dungeon Merchants to detect the energies of these treasures, and they appeared randomly in these Dungeons.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If an adventurer was unable to find the treasures, the Dungeon Merchants acquired the rights to take the unfound treasures. \u00a0Around half the population considered to be adventurers were poor at detecting treasures on each floor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if an adventurer knew why a Dungeon Merchant had appeared, the adventurer wouldn\u2019t be able to find the treasure unless they were very skilled. \u00a0An adventurer could search the entirety of the Dungeon for treasures just based on the fact that a Dungeon Merchant had appeared, but the chance of finding the treasure was close to zero.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Artpe was an anomaly. \u00a0Even before the Dungeon Merchant had appeared, he knew what was waiting for him at the end of the 6th floor. \u00a0He had located everything, so there was nothing else to say. \u00a0He grinned as he shook the bottle containing the green powder.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo you aren\u2019t going to buy it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Mycenae\u2019s expression crumpled in distress, but her instinct as a merchant was soon brought to the fore.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKoo-oohk\u2026. \u00a0\u00a0I\u2019ll buy it for 2 gold.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. \u00a0I hope you meet a pushover next time, who will be easily deceived by you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe turned around without hesitation, and Mycenae desperately reached out towards him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'll give you 4 gold! \u00a0You have to factor in the processing cost! \u00a0The processing cost!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI made sure there wasn\u2019t a single drop of water remained. \u00a0What processing fee? \u00a0Give me 10 gold.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are being heavy-handed\u2026.!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you don't\u2019 buy it for 10 gold, there will be no trade.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe was firm. \u00a0He was so resolute that it made one wonder if the creator, who made the boundaries between ocean and land, spoke in such a way in the past.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Mycenae knew that the person in front of her already knew the exact worth of the item within her hand. \u00a0If so, what choice did she have? \u00a0She had no choice, but to agree to his demand!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll buy it for 10 gold.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. \u00a0Since you bought the Basilisk Venom Powder for the price of 10 gold, this isn\u2019t a losing proposition for you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou even knew the name\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Mycenae decided to treat him like an experienced merchant. \u00a0When one met a person like him, the fact that she didn\u2019t take a loss was a form of victory!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, she would be able to gather information on a little-known adventurer on this continent. \u00a0She would be able to gain massive profit from it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNext\u2026 \u00a0I want you to repair our equipments.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cRepair\u2026 \u00a0All right. \u00a0Huh? \u00a0All your equipment are artifacts, but\u2026. \u00a0\u00a0Overall, you guys have pretty bad equipment. \u00a0Does this mean that your levels are also\u2026..?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI told you not to pry any further.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It cost 50 silvers to repair all the equipment. \u00a0He paid 40 silvers after receiving the 20% discount.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Mycenae never expected him to discount the price of the repair fee, but she also knew she had acted rude in the first place. \u00a0This was why she couldn\u2019t do anything about it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNext, I want boots and helmet for her. \u00a0I want a robe. \u00a0I want you to give me your best performing equipment with the lowest level restriction.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI have boots and helmet made from the bones of a Blood Ketai. \u00a0The two items will be worth 8 gold\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSince I\u2019m receiving a 20% discount, I\u2019ll give you 6 gold and 30 silver. \u00a0\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJeez. \u00a0You should just give up on being an adventurer to become a merchant.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel\u2019s lower extremities and head had been vulnerable compared to the other regions of her body. \u00a0She now had defensive gears that could protect those regions. \u00a0Artpe purchased a robe made out of a black fabric. \u00a0The threads were knitted using the quills of the Darkness Hedgehog, which had the ability to manipulate magical energy. \u00a0The robe increased one\u2019s Mana by a small amount, and it had a modest ability to obstruct other\u2019s perception. \u00a0This was why he had to pay 6 golds for it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, these equipment weren\u2019t something that could be obtained by level 40s. \u00a0The power of money was really great.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere, Maetel. \u00a0You should be pretty safe wearing these.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. \u00a0Ah-ooh. \u00a0It is so expensive. \u00a0These expensive items are for me\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The fact that Artpe had obtained 10 gold by selling a weird powder was already shocking in itself. \u00a0Now that she saw so much gold being exchanged for their equipment, she became delirious.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe cows we can buy with that much money\u2026. \u00a0One, two three\u2026. \u00a0Ooh-ahhhhh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCalm down, Maetel. \u00a0Also, I want to purchase water and food with the remaining money, ajumma. \u00a0Give me the cheapest ones.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m not an ajumma! \u00a0I\u2019m a green spring girl!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf ajumma is a maiden, then I\u2019m a hero.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh-ahhhhhhhhh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Mycenae didn\u2019t know that Artpe was really a hero. \u00a0She was infuriated when she saw his sly smile! \u00a0However, the heroes weren\u2019t paying attention to her anymore.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh ooh. \u00a0I don\u2019t like food that doesn\u2019t taste good\u2026...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cA hard bread you eat right now will come back as tenderloin steak in the future. \u00a0You have to be patient.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......yes, I\u2019ll be patient! \u00a0I\u2019ll wait until happiness comes to Artpe and I!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo, you don\u2019t have to wait that long.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Mycenae took the money pouch put forth by Artpe. \u00a0She emptied it, then she started preparing the dry foods and water. \u00a0Mycenae was dumbfounded as she heard Artpe placate Maetel.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou guys act as if you\u2019ve been clearing Dungeons for 20 years. \u00a0You guys must have received fantastic training at home.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNone of your business.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He spoke in a brusque manner as he received the bag with dry foods and canteens containing water. \u00a0After he put away the items inside his robe, he let out a sigh as he raised his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Mycenae somehow managed to regain her business smile. \u00a0She gave him a cute smile, yet Artpe was apathetic. \u00a0He shooed her off with his hand as he spoke to her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, you should go now. \u00a0We\u2019ll probably meet again soon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll see my customers off from here!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNope.

aware of it! \u00a0She had endured all the humiliation up until now as an attempt to get him to act careless. \u00a0She even sold her wares at a very cheap price, yet at that moment, her plan went up in smoke!</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

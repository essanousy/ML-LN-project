(5)</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From time immemorial, the red color signified a warrior, and the blue color signified a magician. \u00a0Of course, the population of magicians was very small compared to the warriors. \u00a0This was why it \u00a0was clear, who this was prepared for.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNormally, Heroes are are able to learn both. \u00a0They possess the power of a warrior and the power of a magician.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBut I can\u2019t use magic!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI already know that fact, so you don\u2019t have to repeat it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">During their spare time, he had tried to teach her the basics of magic. \u00a0However, all his attempts had failed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was dumb. \u00a0She was so obviously dumb that no one would be able to say otherwise. \u00a0If one gave her a sword, she was a genius, who could easily take down monsters that were much higher in level than her. \u00a0At the same time, she was an idiot, who couldn\u2019t figure out a simple math problem. \u00a0It was said that the heavens was fair in its dealings. \u00a0This truth was never felt so keenly as when he looked at Maetel.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat is why you have to learn how to do magic.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe can split them between us in a friendly way!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel let out a pure laugh. \u00a0This really wasn\u2019t something that should be laughed at. \u00a0Artpe kept sighing as they ran down towards the plaza that existed below the fountain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When they touched the floor, the entrance made by Maetel closed as a ceiling slid into place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWould you look at this\u2026..?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This felt weird. \u00a0Artpe narrowed his eyes as he looked at his surrounding. \u00a0Fortunately, they were in a large space. \u00a0A waterway had been created, so there was a constant stream of fresh water available. \u00a0It was so clear that they would be able to drink it straight out of the waterway. \u00a0They also wouldn\u2019t have to worry about running out of air.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, there were no exits here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBasically, the Dungeon hasn\u2019t ended yet\u2026.?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Now that he thought about it, he had killed the Death Knight, who had been the last monster connected to the Record Link. \u00a0They had received EXP from it, yet the energy of the Record Link still remained in this place. He was sure there weren\u2019t any monsters left. \u00a0However, it seemed a test remained. \u00a0Maybe, the act of learning the Skills was a form of test.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere is something written here, Artpe.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel had walked towards the altar before Artpe, and she was pointing at a section of the altar.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh. \u00a0You are right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe headed towards the altar, and he could see hard characters carved into it. \u00a0If he was to be precise, this was the language of the Ancient Empire. \u00a0No one in this world would have an easy time reading it. \u00a0However, Artpe was an exception since he possessed the Read All Creation ability.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2018I congratulate you for overcoming the trials, beginner hero. \u00a0Anyone who was able to find this place would know about me, so I won\u2019t talk about myself.\u2019...... \u00a0\u00a0Even this introduction is all wrong.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe must have been a really famous person.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFame erodes away over time. \u00a0He was foolish for not knowing this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe read those arrogant words. \u00a0He sneered at the desire for fame that was unique to humans. \u00a0\u00a0Maetel didn\u2019t know about his slimy inner thoughts, so she continued to laugh, while saying Artpe was smart.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Artpe didn\u2019t care about learning about the name of the hero. \u00a0He had a general idea as to who it was. The man boldy wrote about beginner heroes. \u00a0He was probably a former hero from a generation or several generations ago.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe didn\u2019t know who the previous generation\u2019s hero was. \u00a0He didn\u2019t even know the name of the previous generation\u2019s Demon King. \u00a0He just knew that the language of the Ancient Empire was being used here, so at the very least, this Dungeon was several hundred years old.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2018I had faith that a hero would one day be born again in this land. \u00a0I also believed that this hero would come looking for my tomb. \u00a0However, I cannot give you the secrets of the hero just because you are a junior, who respects your sunbae. This is why I put forth the Record Link to test you. \u00a0Please forgive me.\u2019\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt seems this person was born around here too.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes and he was spectacularly forgotten by everyone.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">By its outside appearance, how could this be the grave of a previous hero? \u00a0No one in his past life knew about this truth! \u00a0At this point, it was a wonder as to how the information became so perfectly hidden!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Still, it was believable when he thought more on it. \u00a0There was a high probability that Maetel was a descendant of this previous hero. \u00a0It was normal for the family of heroes to have one or two \u00a0secrets.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2018I believe any hero that was able to safely reach this point will be able to complete the next task. \u00a0I trust you, and I will not be suspicious of you. \u00a0I have placed these presents here for my junior. \u00a0All you have experienced to reach this point were lessons. \u00a0I placed a mixture of skill and spell that is tied to the Record Link. \u00a0You should learn it before you leave.\u2019\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The words ended there. \u00a0Artpe was surprised by this fact. \u00a0He thought the man would continue to boast by writing around 10,000 words, but he had ended it more cleanly than Artpe had expected.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, let me see\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After reading all the words, Artpe\u2019s gaze once again headed towards the altar with the books placed on top of it. \u00a0One was a spell book and the other one was a skill book. \u00a0He had wondered why he couldn't read the content of the books with his Read All Creation ability. \u00a0The flow of the Record Link was connected to the books.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had never expected to see skills that were completed using the influence of magic. \u00a0In his past life as one of the Four Heavenly Kings, he had never heard of such a thing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maybe it was a matter of course since no one in his past life had discovered this place. \u00a0He had always believed that Record Link was full of side effect, so he never thought about such unimaginable benefits it could bring.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The Record Link wasn\u2019t made with the intent of just tormenting us..\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe was enlightened. \u00a0Of course, the anger at the sunbae, who had driven Maetel and him to the brink of death, still remained!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis sunbae really cared about his juniors!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI think so, too. \u00a0Now let us worry about what is to come.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was now sure of the sunbae hero\u2019s intent. \u00a0However, Artpe\u2019s personality wouldn\u2019t let him cross a stone bridge when he could destroy and build a steel bridge. \u00a0He used his Read All Creation ability to carefully inspect his surrounding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHmmmm\u2026...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat is it, Artpe?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. \u00a0It just feels a little bit off to me. \u00a0However, I don\u2019t see anything abnormal.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was sure there were no additional traps here. \u00a0He was only slightly worried about the fact that all the Mana within the Dungeon was being funneled into the altar\u2026.. \u00a0Since they had already reached this point, they couldn\u2019t make additional preparations. \u00a0There was nothing they could do that would make them more prepared for what was to come.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If so, it was time to move forward. \u00a0It didn't matter what was waiting for them. \u00a0It was time to act.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m ready, Artpe.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMe too. \u00a0\u2026..Alright. \u00a0Now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe and Maetel exchanged glances. \u00a0They stepped forward at the same time, and they reached out their hands towards their respective book. \u00a0At that moment, they felt a pressure as if their entire body was being sucked towards the book. \u00a0Their hands stuck to the books.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKoohk!?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEndure it. \u00a0If we falter here, the Record Link will run out of control!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">All the Mana within the Dungeon was flowing towards the two books placed on top of the altar. All the records that had mounted for the past year was being split into two. \u00a0It flowed into the two books using the Record Link, and after it finished its mission, it dissipated.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo\u2026. \u00a0Ha.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh-ahhhhh. \u00a0I\u2019m tired. This is too difficult.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEndure it!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">All the tasks completed by Artpe and Maetel was influenced by the effect of overwhelming Mana, and it was formed into a skill and a spell. \u00a0Each appeared in front of their respective owners. \u00a0However, Artpe\u2019s face crumpled when the new magic spell established itself within his brain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This is\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he entered this Dungeon, he had accomplished his tasks by using Mana. \u00a0What he did was more of a magic manipulation rather than using a magic spell. \u00a0Still, he never expected a strange magic that contradicted the root theories of magic and Mana to come into being!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he learned to use it properly, he thought it could be something incredible. \u00a0However, this was a magic spell unbefitting a magician! \u00a0It was questionable as to whether he should actually call this a magic spell!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSsssp. \u00a0Since this is a Unique Magic for heroes, I have no choice but to learn it\u2026. \u00a0\u00a0Ooh-ahhhhhhhh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, a big event occurred. \u00a0What would happen if the Mana maintaining the Dungeon was split and sent into the books on the altar? \u00a0Of course, the Dungeon would collapse! Artpe had been worrying about such a situation !</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI knew something like this would happen! \u00a0Shit! \u00a0That bugger of a sunbae!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An advanced concept of magical circuitry was being impressed upon his body. \u00a0However, he didn\u2019t even have the chance to be happy about it. \u00a0He had to learn the skill as soon as possible, so he could escape this Dungeon!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe grinded his teeth as he looked towards Maetel. \u00a0In terms of battle skills, she possessed a god-given talent. \u00a0If it\u2019s Maetel, she should be learning the skill at a faster rate than him\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUghh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey you fooooooooooool!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel had her head down as if she was perfectly powerless. \u00a0He never expected her to fail at acquiring the skill! \u00a0The timing of this was too perfect. \u00a0This was like a bad joke! \u00a0He wished she would do this at a later time when they could afford to do so!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe gritted his teeth as he raised his hand. \u00a0The blue leather bound book had already done its part, so it was completely gone now. \u00a0He would be able to use the magic at any time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He could use it right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMana String!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Others wouldn\u2019t be able to see it, but strings of black mana extended out from his five fingers. Up until now, Artpe had directly manipulated Mana to solve problems in the Dungeon. \u00a0The reason being he had only a single spell in his arsenal. \u00a0It seemed the Unique magic spell was fixed into taking on a similar form!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKoohp. \u00a0Break it all!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Artpe would have been very disappointed if that was all there was to it. \u00a0However, the Mana String he was using was undeniably a spell. \u00a0It was a miracle that started out as Mana, but it was shaped into becoming a spell. \u00a0Unlike the threads he manipulated before, the Mana String could interact with magical energy. \u00a0Moreover, it was very high in physical power as it was able to affect nature.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why the five strands of Mana String was able to stop the Dungeon\u2019s ceiling from collapsing, and falling on top of their heads.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cArtpe is incredible! \u00a0You are too strong!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you have the time to be impressed by me, you should learn the Skill!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBut this is too hard\u2026. \u00a0Ughhh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey you fooooooooooool!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It didn\u2019t matter if Artpe\u2019s mana reserve was enormous. \u00a0It was impossible to prop up the Dungeon\u2019s collapsing ceiling indefinitely! \u00a0Artpe screamed as he diligently controlled the Mana Strings. Maetel clung desperately to the skill book.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHurry, Maetel!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOooooooh, \u00a0ughhhhhh\u2026...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The black Mana Strings boasted an overwhelmingly more powerful destructive force compared to the ones that controlled the shield with the Slow Down curse. \u00a0Moreover, there were five of them!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The five long strands of black Mana Strings started to spin violently, and it was grinding up the entire Dungeon. \u00a0Artpe was fighting desperately. \u00a0He had activated the Hyper Rubbing. \u00a0It was such an overpowering sight that it made one wonder if he was really fighting for his life.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMy Mana consumption is that much higher! \u00a0Hurry up and succeed before it is too late, Maetel! \u00a0I\u2019ll do anything you want if you succeed! \u00a0Please hurry up!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAnything!? \u00a0Ah, I did it! \u00a0I learned it! \u00a0Hurray!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are really honest about your desires!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The red leather bound book was finally gone! \u00a0By the look of \u00a0Maetel\u2019s bright eyes, it seemed she had learned the skill. \u00a0He was puzzled as to why a genius of martial arts like Maetel had struggled to learn the skill. \u00a0He wondered what it was. \u00a0However, Artpe didn\u2019t have the time to ask such questions!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cArtpe! \u00a0The altar!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI know. \u00a0Hurry up and take my hand!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed the disappearance of the two books was a trigger. \u00a0The altar kept spinning as it lowered into the ground. The flow of water that had been swirling around the space started to gather itself towards the space vacated by the altar. \u00a0The water was being sucked into it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After he checked what was going on, he quickly grabbed Maetel\u2019s hand. \u00a0He used his other hand to destroy the rocks that were falling towards them. \u00a0They threw themselves into the portal where the water was exiting. \u00a0There must be a path leading outside!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cArtpe, I don\u2019t think this tunnel is intact\u2026...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOf course. \u00a0There isn\u2019t much Mana left. \u00a0That bastard of a sunbae was good at handling spells, but he was terrible at preserving and distributing Mana. \u00a0That damn\u2026.!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Fortunately, they could see a faint light at the end of the passageway. \u00a0Artpe spat out all kinds of swear words as water splashed every time they took a step. \u00a0They moved quickly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was around this time when Maetel was finally free from the aftereffect of acquiring the skill. \u00a0She bit her lips as she tugged at his hand, and she carried him on her back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cRecord Divide!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat the hell. \u00a0What does that skill with the slightly cool name do\u2026.. \u00a0Ooh-ohhhhhhhhhhh!?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel started running faster. \u00a0It was as if she was about to evaporate the water on the floor with her blazing speed. \u00a0She did so in the nick of time, since the passageway started to collapse. \u00a0An incredible amount of water was falling towards them!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEee-ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe was having a hard time seeing his surrounding, so he desperate extended his Mana Strings. \u00a0He dispersed the water and the falling rock fragments that were falling towards their heads.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHurrrrrrrrrry up, Maetel!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe \u00a0are almost there! \u00a0I can see the exit, Artpe!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The light was getting closer. \u00a0However, Artpe\u2019s Mana was also bottoming out! \u00a0They had only a little ways to go. \u00a0Were they going to be buried like this? \u00a0It was an end befitting the weakest amongst the Four Heavenly Kings, but Maetel was also here with him!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll give you my Mana, Artpe!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026.. \u00a0\u00a0Uh? \u00a0Do you even have Mana to spare\u2026. \u00a0\u00a0Uh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Mana started flowing into him from Maetel. \u00a0Artpe hadn\u2019t used his Link magic. \u00a0At that moment, Artpe was taken aback, but he soon came to an understanding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou said Record Drive. \u00a0You\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe skill has a similar effect as Artpe\u2019s magic! \u00a0It has a wider range of use\u2026. \u00a0Anyways, hurry!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel didn\u2019t have to urge him on. \u00a0He was already using his spell. \u00a0All the Mana received from her was put straight into the Mana Strings.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Before Artpe and Maetel\u2019s heads could be bashed open, the chunks of rocks were grinded away in an instant. \u00a0They threw themselves towards the light right before they reached the end of the passageway.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh-wahhhhhhh,, \u00a0Artpe-ehhhhhhhhhhh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes! \u00a0This is it!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He could hear the sound of water. \u00a0Water was everywhere. \u00a0Artpe let out a refreshing smile as he shouted out his words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s a waterfall! \u00a0Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was how the heroes were successful in escaping their very first Dungeon. \u00a0The two heroes were 13 years old, and they were beings that defied all the records and history of the continent. \u00a0This was the moment when the strongest little hero duo stepped out into the world.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

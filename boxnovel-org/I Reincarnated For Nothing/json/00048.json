background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the past year, the party had focused on Sienna\u2019s growth rather than the development of Maetel and Artpe. \u00a0Above all else, their goal was to arrive at Frate, so they hadn\u2019t bee able to raise their levels too much.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, Artpe had focused on gaining command over his Mana String until he was sick of it. \u00a0He also focused on increasing his proficiency in other magic spells. \u00a0There were the basic everyday magic like Fire and Aqua. \u00a0Then there was the Hyper Rubbing, which had been unexpectedly helpful in decisive moments. \u00a0Obviously, Mana String had developed into being his main spell. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He had used all his spell whenever he had Mana to spare, so most of his spells had exceeded level 40. \u00a0Amongst his spells, Mana String had reached level 51. \u00a0No words need to be said, but the power and effectiveness of his spells couldn\u2019t be compared to before.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It wasn\u2019t just the level of his spells. \u00a0Whenever he gathered money, he used Dungeon merchant Mycenae to gather spell books for all classes. \u00a0He used them to increase his Magic stat. \u00a0It resulted in his Magic stat reaching 1,200 when he was at level 187.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In his prior live, Artpe had gone past the 1,200 mark when he had reached level 300. \u00a0His magical energy reached a realm where his level couldn\u2019t be use to gauge his power. \u00a0Moreover, he possessed enough magical energy to overcome disparities that should be impossible to overcome. \u00a0He possessed that power within his hands.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">His spell level was over 50, and he possessed a massive pool of magical energy. \u00a0It had reached 1,200. \u00a0It would have been strange if he wasn\u2019t able to search a mere city with his magic.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">His Mana Strings had started out as several dozen strands, but now it had branched into hundreds than thousands. \u00a0In a flash, his Mana Strings had blanketed the entire city. \u00a0The Mana Strings were able to observe everything near their vicinity, and all the information was delivered to their owner. \u00a0Nothing could escape Artpe\u2019s eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had been two days, since he was reincarnated as a human male child, \u00a0This was when Artpe came to a decision.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI have to kill the Demon King.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a really fucked up situation, but he had to kill the Demon King.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Why?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The reason was obvious. \u00a0A Demon King's 1st priority was to kill all of humanity. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe was a human now!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Would he have been better being reborn into the Demon race? \u00a0No way.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The reason why the bastard was trying to kill all the humans was the fact that the Demon King\u2019s Innate Ability didn't allow him to dominate over humans. \u00a0His Innate Ability only worked on the Demon race, and the Demon King had been thorough in catching all the demons. \u00a0He had put all the Demons under his rule.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since the Demon King existed in the same era as him, there was no way he\u2019ll become free unless he killed the Demon King. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe had lamented when he was confronted with this decision. \u00a0He wanted to be alive to see the hopes and dreams of the future.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Why in the hell did I have to be sent back to the past! \u00a0If I was born 3 years after the hero or the Demon King was killed, I could have lived in the countryside without any ambitions. \u00a0I could have just lived, while I tended cows!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He could somewhat guess at the mechanism behind his reincarnation. \u00a0His Read All Creation had evolved into its second stage. \u00a0He didn\u2019t know the exact cause, but he knew this was all related to his ability.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He always knew his ability was unusual, but he never expected it to be able to bend time and space. \u00a0No, the fact that there even was a Step 2 to his Innate Ability was a surprise for him!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the problem he now faced was the fact that his Innate Ability had distorted not only time, but the cause-and-effect relationship of events.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cArtpe!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The door opened in the same fashion as two days ago. \u00a0A bright light entered into the hut, and Artpe already knew the name of the girl entering the hut.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI knew you would come, \u2018Maetel\u2019.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou were waiting for me! \u00a0I'm so happy!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The girl let out a bright smile in front of Artpe. \u00a0She looked very young, but he was sure that she was one of the heroes in his memories, who had invaded the Demon King\u2019s castle. \u00a0He had also verified this fact through his Read All Creation ability, so it was irrefutable.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy would I wait for you? \u00a0Just looking at you make me feel anxious.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAnxious? \u2026..Ah, jeez~ \u00a0Artpe~ \u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The 12 year old hero was under a false impression when she heard Artpe's words. \u00a0She squirmed and twisted her body in embarrassment. \u00a0Artpe groaned when he saw the young hero fall into a delusion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">During his past role as one of the Four Heavenly Kings of the Demon King\u2019s army, the Demon King had ordered Artpe to gather information about the hero. \u00a0In truth, it was a task beneath even the weakest amongst the Four Heavenly Kings, but that fact wasn\u2019t important right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The important part was the fact that the past hero didn\u2019t have a childhood friend.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet's go play being heroes, Artpe!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'm sorry, but I'm sick of both the heroes and the Demon King.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen you can be one of the Demon King army's Four Heavenly Kings!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat is one thing I'll never do!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe pushed aside the hero, who came at him in a playful manner. \u00a0He kept letting out a sigh. \u00a0He had wished for a life where he wasn\u2019t entangled with the Demon King, so this time around he was entangled with the hero. \u00a0If he had the opportunity to meet the goddess of fate, he would most definitely flip her off!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead of being entangled with the hero, he would have preferred to live life as the normal Villager A. \u00a0Then he would be able to focus on his profession, while leaving all the problems of this world to the hero. \u00a0He could just put his trust in the hero, since her unlimited growth potential would let her overcome everything. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he was unlucky enough to chance upon the hero\u2019s party, he would just say, \u2018If you follow down this road, you will come upon the Demon King\u2019s Castle!\u2019 \u00a0Or he would tell them, \u2018Our town\u2019s population of wildcats have gotten out of control. \u00a0Could you help us catch them?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He would just tell them some half assed excuse to get rid of them! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This world is already different from the past I knew\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">To be precise, Artpe had reincarnated as the hero\u2019s childhood friend. \u00a0From this point on, the future would be in flux. \u00a0Even if he ran away from the hero right now, the changed timeline wouldn\u2019t revert back. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t a realistic possibility.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEh-whew. \u00a0Artpe is trying to play by himself again. \u00a0Then I have no choice. \u00a0I'll stick by your side.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo, I really don't need you right now. \u00a0Could you leave me alone?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBut I need Artpe.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe despaired. \u00a0What the hell did he do before he became aware of his previous life\u2019s memories? \u00a0Why was he in such a good relationship with the hero! \u00a0It was so bad that even if he managed to run away, he worried the hero would track him down!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou....\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEh-heh-heh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The hero let out a simple and honest laugh as she sat next to Artpe. \u00a0It seemed events weren\u2019t going to proceed in accordance to Artpe\u2019s wishes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was a problem. \u00a0Artpe\u2019s biggest worry was the relationship he had with the hero.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A hero was literally a walking box of storm and calamity. \u00a0Even the most peaceful town would be put in danger when the hero became involved. \u00a0Moreover, anyone who encounters the hero becomes embroiled in the hero\u2019s business.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the past, there was a very famous story about the hero taking every valuable item when passing through each town. \u00a0\u00a0The most insidious part about this story was the fact the townspeople had an irresistible urge to give whatever they possessed to the hero. \u00a0If the hero fulfilled a request, one would have to give up a treasure as recompense!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">So what would his life be like as the childhood friend of the hero!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018No. \u00a0I don\u2019t know how the future will unfold. \u00a0This girl might not awaken to become a hero.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If a Demon King existed, a hero always appeared. \u00a0However, Artpe had reincarnated as a human, so the future had changed. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t a certainty that Maetel would awaken as a hero.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStill, I wouldn\u2019t bet on it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel would become a hero, and as her childhood friend, he would get swept up in her business.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, that scenario was the most likely one to come true. \u00a0In this world, the most talented person was chosen to become the hero. \u00a0Artpe had used his Read All Creation to verify the talent possessed by the 12 year old Maetel. \u00a0She was so outstanding that it made one wonder if the gods made a mistake in creating her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He followed this thread of logic to come to his previous conclusion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had to kill the Demon King.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMy life as a demon\u2026 \u00a0No. \u00a0My life as a human is really\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe wrapped his head with his hands as he despaired. \u00a0Maetel consoled him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHang in there, Artpe! \u00a0We have to endure, and we have to live five times the life we have already lived!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhere did you learn such a phrase?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI learned it from Artpe.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed he wasn\u2019t a normal guy even before he recovered his memories! \u00a0Artpe\u2019s head started to hurt more. \u00a0Maetel, who didn\u2019t know his inner thoughts, kept smiling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI only want to live a quiet life.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou always say those words, Artpe.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHowever, the world won\u2019t leave me alone.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat is also one of your favorite phrases you like to speak.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt isn\u2019t really important how I got here. \u00a0How should I proceed from now on\u2026. \u00a0Mmmm?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He grumbled as he started responding to Maetel when a flash of light illuminated the inside of his mind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Until now, he had assumed that the future was distorted, because he had reincarnated as the hero\u2019s childhood friend. \u00a0However, was that actually true?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the past, Artpe had used his Read All Creation to track the hero\u2019s whereabouts. \u00a0Of course, he also had a complete grasp of what developed in the human world.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Would everything he remembered change just because of Artpe\u2019s presence? \u00a0He was only a single person.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018There\u2019s no way that would happen.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yes. \u00a0At best, an additional male child was born in a mountain village. \u00a0There was no way such an event would cause the war to be canceled or a king to be poisoned!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, how could that be the only implication? \u00a0He knew the location of legendary thief\u2019s grave. \u00a0The grave held riches. \u00a0He also knew the locations of the Archmage\u2019s ruin, Balrok\u2019s Nest, and Archmage Rain of Louin\u2019s Magic Tome. \u00a0They would be in the same place as the locations in his memories!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMy god.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He finally realized the whole truth, and a shiver ran up his body. \u00a0His Read All Creation ability allowed him to remember what had happened in the human world and the demon world. \u00a0\u00a0It didn\u2019t matter if a lot of event in his future would change. \u00a0He still had many information that he could use to his advantage!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were many riches, many magic, many skills and many hidden hunting grounds!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf I can acquire all of this with her\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, Artpe.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel\u2019s cheeks turned red. \u00a0Artpe had mumbled his words, and it seemed another big misunderstanding had occurred. \u00a0However, Artpe was too excited to worry about it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf that happens, maybe\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He\u2019ll be able to compress the development process of the hero, and she would be able to gain items that were never in the possession of her previous self. \u00a0If he could let her gain everything he figured out with his Read All Creation ability, the killing of the Demon King might not be a problem!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he could make that happen, he would be free! \u00a0Moreover, he could use the position of being the hero\u2019s childhood friend to lead a peaceful life!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The future he could foresee was letting out a radiant golden light. \u00a0Artpe suddenly stood up from his seat. \u00a0Maetel also stood up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. \u00a0Leave everything to me, hero.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHero? As expected, you do want to play hero!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'm not talking about playing house with you. \u00a0I\u2019ve never been as serious as this moment in my life.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7ah, all right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The hero\u2019s face had turned red, and she kept nodding her head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'll leave everything to Artpe.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou just nodded your head. \u00a0You can\u2019t take it back.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is true for Artpe too! \u00a0You can\u2019t back out of this!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe was satisfied with Maetel\u2019s answer. \u00a0At this point in time, the two of them completely misunderstood what each of them were promising. \u00a0Artpe was dreaming about a peaceful future, so he hadn\u2019t realized this fact.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. \u00a0Then you should head back for now. \u00a0I\u2019ll have to be thorough in making a plan for us.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cA plan... \u00a0\u00a0You are being very earnest about this. \u00a0All right! \u00a0I\u2019ll go wait patiently for you!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maetel turned around, and she opened the door to the hut. \u00a0She was about to exit when she said, \u00a0\u201cOh\u201d, as if she had just remembered something. \u00a0She called out towards Artpe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou do know what is happening in the afternoon, right? \u00a0Baptism Ritual!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBaptism Ritual? \u00a0Ah!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When one was born into the Demon race, one possessed all of one\u2019s abilities from the start. \u00a0Demons had to be ready to fight as soon as they were born. \u00a0However, humans were different. \u00a0Humans had to contact the gods through the priests, and a Class was given to each human. \u00a0The Classes ranged from carpenter, farmer, adventurer, warrior, etc. \u00a0A human\u2019s station in life was determined at that point. \u00a0The humans call it the Baptism Ritual.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat Class will I receive? \u00a0I\u2019m looking forward to it!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m also looking forward to it, but I could already guess what my Class is.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat's amazing, Artpe!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was limit on what Class one could acquire, and it depended on one\u2019s station in life, and one\u2019s ability. \u00a0One cannot become a knight unless one was a noble. \u00a0One cannot become the heir to the throne unless one was the son of a king. \u00a0If one didn\u2019t have the ability to manipulate Mana, one couldn\u2019t become a magician.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Still, it didn\u2019t mean one couldn\u2019t escape an already chosen Class\u2026..</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Artpe smiled as he felt the unrefined Mana circulate around his body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was it because he was a Demon in the past? \u00a0Currently, he was only a 12 year old child, yet he had a large reserve of Mana. \u00a0Moreover, he could wield the Mana freely. \u00a0Unless something went wrong, he would probably become a magician.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou\u2019ll probably become a hero.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHero?

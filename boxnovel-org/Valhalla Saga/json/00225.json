In a normal situation, this wasn\u2019t a place where Tae Ho could spread the \u2018Hall of Valhalla\u2019 even if he did get strong. Actually, when Nyx handled the power of the world and was controlling it, he hadn\u2019t been able to even think about doing it.</p><br/><p>But the situation had changed now.</p><br/><p>Nyx couldn\u2019t use the power of the world anymore. The night covering all of Olympus had met its end.</p><br/><p>In addition Zeus allowed that. The ruler of Olympus that had returned, the king of Gods, allowed Tae Ho in the mount of Olympus.</p><br/><p>And so, the complete Asgard descended. The land, where the energy of Olympus was the strongest, transformed into the strongest power of Valhalla.</p><br/><p>And the effects were better than he imagined.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t only stop at Odin, Thor, Siri and Bracky getting a hold of themselves. The ancient Gods felt extreme uneasiness and chaos inside of Asgard.</p><br/><p>It was unavoidable. They were ancient Gods. In the first place, they have never even imagined about getting separated from Olympus since they were born. They felt a mental shock that was equivalent to fish getting dragged out of the water by force.</p><br/><p>Nyx let out a groan with a pale face. Erebos and Tartarus that weren\u2019t complete personality Gods in the first place received a strong influence from her. They couldn\u2019t shake off the fluster easily.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s end this.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn said. Tae Ho agreed and grabbed Gae Bolg instead of the Sword of the round table. Tae Ho was already quite exhausted because of the battle against the one handling the power of the world but he had to endure.</p><br/><p>Thor grabbed the cracked Mjolnir and walked towards the ancient Gods. Bracky raised his hammer behind him and assisted him with his strength. He nodded towards Siri, that was supporting him, and Siri separated from him after a moment of hesitation. He nocked the arrow of Apollo in the bow of Artemis.</p><br/><p>Odin laughed pleasantly. He inhaled the air of Asgard and rolled his finger. A strong rune magic was drawn from the tip of the hands of the God of magic and Nyx staggered back unconsciously. She had destroyed Odin\u2019s magic really easily until now but she couldn\u2019t do that now. The unknown magic Odin made became a blade of fear that stabbed her.</p><br/><p>And Odin was someone that knew how to handle that fear really well. He was the God of war that was the most proficient in threats and pressuring among the ones in this place.</p><br/><p>He shook the rune magic lightly and took a step towards Nyx. Sweat started to flow down from Nyx\u2019s forehead and back like rain. She obtained a complete soul and flesh and that\u2019s why she got able to experience the results her bewilderment made.</p><br/><p>ANd at some point Erebos and Tartarus roared. They let out an enraged roar as if doing it instead of Nyx and their power advanced towards the Gods of Asgard.</p><br/><p>Odin activated a rune magic hurriedly and blocked the shadow of Erebos. Thor swung mjolnir and at the same time caused lightning to disperse the emptiness of Tartarus.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho charged forward. Nyx raised her spear of death and SIri fired her arrow towards her. It was an attack that was enough to shake Nyx\u2019s senses that has sharpened to the extreme.</p><br/><p>Kang!</p><br/><p>Nyx parried the arrow and Tae Ho closed the distance in that opening. He passed Erebos and Tartarus that were enduring in front of Nyx with the power of Talaria and rushed against Nyx.</p><br/><p>Gae Bolg and the spear of darkness clashed. Nyx tried to endure Tae Ho\u2019s attack with her strong power as an ancient God but it didn\u2019t turn as she wished. The difference in their capabilities was too big to just press him down with strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cNyx!\u201d</p><br/><p>Erebos yelled and turned around and then Thor charged towards him. He raised his Iron hammer of emptiness to try to block the God of thunder charging towards him while swinging Mjolnir but it wasn\u2019t easy.</p><br/><p>Thor was strong. He had already been defeated and collapsed several times but he was still strong.</p><br/><p>Odin gave strength to Thor. Bracky laughed like a man and became one with the thunder Thor called.</p><br/><p>Mjolnir with the chest of Tartarus with blue lightning. Tartarus, that had the appearance of a man bigger than Bracky, vomited blood.</p><br/><p>But Thor didn\u2019t stop. He exploded lightning in his chest a few more times and glared at Erebos. Erebos let out an enraged roar and charged at the gaze of Thor that had electricity running in it. The arrow of Siri aimed for Erebos\u2019 forehead.</p><br/><p>Kwakang!</p><br/><p>Nyx gulped dry saliva at the loud thunder. She barely stopped the attack of Tae Ho flocking like a wave and thought.</p><br/><p>She was in danger. She didn\u2019t have much time.</p><br/><p>Aphrodite and Dionysius were still beings that wanted to destroy the world. There was no way they would turn into beings that wanted to maintain the world as they changed due to the whisper.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why they would be able to buy some time but it wouldn\u2019t be for long.</p><br/><p>SHe had to conclude this battle in that while.</p><br/><p>But will she be able to do so?</p><br/><p>Would she really be able to win?</p><br/><p>\u2018She\u2019s shaken. She\u2019s doubting herself. She ended up falling in the trap of self-ruin that makes you lose a fight you could have won.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn spoke in a low voice. Tae Ho also grasped that truth with the insight of Scathach\u2019s techniques.</p><br/><p>Actually Tae Ho was also at his limit. Odin and Thor had been able to regain a bit of their strength thanks to Asgard having descended but that was only a temporary strength. They were also at a disadvantage the more the battle prolonged.</p><br/><p>They would make a conclusion quickly. They would burst their last strength and bring an end to this battle.</p><br/><p>The thoughts of both sides concluded and the flow of the fight became faster.</p><br/><p>Zeus raised his head. He had avoided death thanks to having eaten an apple and then he looked at the sun that drove away the night and the power of the ancient Gods trying to cover the world once again. He looked at the flashing thunder inside the night, darkness and emptiness.</p><br/><p>Zeus could know instinctively. The moment of conclusion was approaching. The time when the two sides released their last strength was coming.</p><br/><p>Then, he would organize the beginning for that.</p><br/><p>Zeus moved his hand and made Astrape rolling in the ground surge up. He made it flash in the middle of the battle.</p><br/><p>That became like a signal just like Zeus had planned. Mjolnir slammed the head of Tartarus. The sword Erebos used to stab got blocked at the magic barrier Odin spread. Siri\u2019s arrow pierced Erebos\u2019 eye.</p><br/><p>And the spear of darkness got parried away. Gae Bolg pierced Nyx\u2019s left shoulder.</p><br/><p>Nyx held back her scream and grabbed Gae Bolg. She, that rose up from the Void of chaos first with Gaia, wasn\u2019t only in charge of the night. It wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to say that darkness and death started from her night.</p><br/><p>She pressed down the death of Gae Bolg with her right over death. She released her darkness through Gae Bolg that wanted to at least die together with her.</p><br/><p>She glared at Tae Ho and yelled.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop this if you can! My darkness! My night!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho didn\u2019t do that. He let go of Gae Bolg with no regrets.</p><br/><p>Bewilderment spread in Nyx\u2019s eyes. Death and darkness surged up like exploding through Gae Bolg and then Tae Ho threw a punch and hit Nyx\u2019s stomach. When she coughed and staggered, Tae Ho grabbed something else aside of the Sword of the round table.</p><br/><p>Mistilteinn.</p><br/><p>The ancient God killing weapon that had been succeeded by the masters of Asgard reacted at his call. It flew up in the air by its own and arrived at Tae Ho\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>Nyx looked at Tae Ho and Tae Ho didn\u2019t evade her gaze. He looked at her black and beautiful eyes fixedly and stabbed Mistilteinn in her chest.</p><br/><p>Nyx vomited black blood and at that moment the power covering her vanished. The night came to an end by the blinding light.</p><br/><p>Erebos and Tartarus scattered. They were ancient Gods that had no personality in the first place but they had descended with an incomplete personality thanks to Nyx. Now that Nyx got defeated, they couldn\u2019t maintain their soul and flesh and returned as being ancient Gods with no personality.</p><br/><p>Thor collapsed in his seat while holding Mjolnir. Odin turned to look at Nyx and Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>Mistilteinn was a short spear and because of that Tae Ho and Nyx were as close as their breath would reach each other.</p><br/><p>Nyx vomited blood and let out a groan and looked at Tae Ho. She couldn\u2019t even have the thought of pulling out Mistilteinn. No, she knew that everything had ended.</p><br/><p>[How regretful.]</p><br/><p>She transmitted her thoughts to Tae Ho directly with her divine power.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho retrieved Gae Bolg and Nyx collapsed in Tae Ho\u2019s embrace.</p><br/><p>Right then Odin yelled and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy was it! Why did you do something like that! Nyx!\u201d</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t thinking that she would simply answer him but this was the only moment she could hear him.</p><br/><p>Why had Nyx suddenly done such things?</p><br/><p>Was it her will alone or someone else interfered in it?</p><br/><p>Nyx smiled with her eyes and Tae Ho whispered towards her.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell us, Nyx.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho poured all his divine power in the rune of Bragi. His actions that had been almost instinctive mad eNyx move. Actually, she was lacking strength to open her mouth but it was enough to stimulate her.</p><br/><p>Nyx buried her head in Tae Ho\u2019s chest. Tae Ho retrieved Mistilteinn and made her more comfortable and Nyx smiled once again. She opened her mouth while dying and transmitted her words.</p><br/><p>[Because I wanted to end it with my own hands. Before it got destroyed by the hands of someone else\u2026.At least by someone that belonged to Olympus\u2026]</p><br/><p>It was up to there. Nyx vomited blood once again and then put a gorgeous smile. She placed her lips on Tae Ho that had been trying to kill her however he could.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t to give him the final curse.</p><br/><p>But because she was an ancient God of Olympus. She loved Olympus so much she wanted to put an end to the world with her own hands.</p><br/><p>It was impossible for a being that wanted to destroy the world to completely understand how another being that wanted to maintain it thought. But the moment their lips touched, Tae Ho felt like he could understand her a bit.</p><br/><p>She had entrusted Olympus to him. She transmitted her wish to him to not let the world get destroyed by another being.</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s a meeting.]</p><br/><p>The price for it should be really slow but it would certainly be the thing you like the most.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho got a bit flustered. Nyx smiled at that look and then leaned her head on Tae Ho\u2019s chest again. She breathed roughly and said.</p><br/><p>[The end\u2026is nearing.]</p><br/><p>The reason she had to stand up.</p><br/><p>The reason she could do that.</p><br/><p>Nyx closed her eyes. The ancient God of night got embraced by the master of Asgard and scattered. She vanished under the shining sun.</p><br/><p>And after some time passed.</p><br/><p>After the lingering like silence passed Cuchulainn opened his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u2018You are incredible. Really incredible.\u2019</p><br/><p>To receive a meeting from Nyx at the end.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn spoke sincerely and his words became the signal that notified the end of the battle.</p><br/><p>Bracky embraced Siri and collapsed. Siri cursed him saying that he was heavy but she still didn\u2019t let him go.</p><br/><p>Thor, that was sitting down, lied down and Odin closed his eye and let out a long sigh.</p><br/><p>The end was nearing.</p><br/><p>The last words Nyx left behind.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho closed his eyes. He put aside his thoughts about her and turned to everyone. He claimed victory over the entire mount of Olympus as the master of Asgard and Erin.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>A conclusion was made in a world.</p><br/><p>They were far away but they still sensed that.</p><br/><p>The destruction of Erin, the victory of Asgard and Olympus.</p><br/><p>But that wasn\u2019t everything. Many more cases were occuring than that.</p><br/><p>And finally, the time had come.</p><br/><p>The space snake Jormungand raised its head. They rose up from the land of perishing, Muspelheim.</p><br/><p>The Kingdom of fire.</p><br/><p>The last flames arose.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 63 \u2013 Myth of a hero (3) &gt; End</p><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/>\n</div>"}

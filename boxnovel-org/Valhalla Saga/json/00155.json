Tae Ho opened them slowly and then blinked a few times. He felt refreshed, as if he had slept a sweet sleep; relaxed, with no exhaustion.</p><br/><p>Because of that, Tae Ho could reply to the voice almost instantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Ragnar,\u201d he said.</p><br/><p>\u2018I know that you are disappointed, as a man is the one that greets you as soon as you open up your eyes. It\u2019s definitely written in your face.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn\u2019s voice was heard as well. Tae Ho laughed unconsciously and then faced Ragnar, who was sitting on a chair in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were safe.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar was his usual self; he didn\u2019t seem injured at all.</p><br/><p>He smiled bitterly and shrugged his shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I had the role of a commander inside the fortress. I\u2019m glad that <i>you</i> are safe. You were out for three nights already.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThree nights?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Two days have already passed since you woke up for a brief moment. They didn\u2019t worry too much as you were sleeping too well, so don\u2019t worry.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho heard Cuchulainn\u2019s explanation and turned to look at himself. It did feel like he had slept for a long time but for it to be that long\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018My exhaustion and magical power had reached its bottom. In addition, the limit had increased because of the runes I absorbed, so it would obviously take time for it to be filled once again.\u2019</p><br/><p>Viewing it with a game-like view, it meant that it took more time for his increased HP to recover again.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou did well anyways. I knew that you would become great but for you to become one this fast\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar wore a sincerely admiring expression, before becoming serious. Then he fixed his sitting posture and placed his hand on his chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thank you, Idun\u2019s warrior, as a warrior of Valhalla. You have rescued Valhalla, Asgard.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was the thanks of none other than the Viking king, Ragnar Lodbrok.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho already knew Ragnar very well but he couldn\u2019t help but feel moved. No, it was even more so, as they knew each other very well.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hey, at this point shouldn\u2019t you say something like \u2018it\u2019s thanks to Cuchulainn-nim having lead someone. It wasn\u2019t by my strength alone\u2019?\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn cracked a joke to make him relax. Tae Ho agreed to that and so also expressed etiquette.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was thanks to everyone in Valhalla,\u201d he replied.</p><br/><p>That was indeed the case.</p><br/><p>The reason he was able to defeat the magician king was thanks to Loki\u2019s sacrifice.</p><br/><p>If Loki hadn\u2019t inflicted a lethal wound on him, Tae Ho would have been the one to get done by.</p><br/><p>It was the same for the world wolf. If it wasn\u2019t for Nidhogg and Hraesvelgr, and if he hadn\u2019t had Rolo\u2019s and Adenmaha\u2019s help, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to defeat it.</p><br/><p>Ragnar also knew that fact, but he still shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut still, you were the pivot. It would have been impossible without you. In the end you are the one that turned Nidhogg and Hraesvelgr into allies and you were the one that rescued Odin-nim. You are also the one that defeated the magician king and the world wolf. Those were things that could be accomplished, because it was you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Would another warrior be able to do the same thing Tae Ho did?</p><br/><p>He wouldn\u2019t. Those were miracles only Tae Ho could have made.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt least Sigurd\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, my eyes really are accurate,\u201d Ragnar said, laughing.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho didn\u2019t know what he was talking about but he looked at Ragnar, who was satisfied, and said with a bit of eagerness and caution, \u201cDon\u2019t become like Cuchulainn, please.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018What are you talking about? Huh?\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho remained silent and Ragnar continued to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, isn\u2019t there anything you are curious about now that you are awake? There\u2019s still some time so I will answer your questions. Aren\u2019t you hungry?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 I\u2019m fine for now. I do want to eat something but I do feel fulfilled.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a bit weird, but he really did feel like that. Ragnar nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should be, because you ate golden apples while you were sleeping. Heda and Adenmaha gave you liquefied golden apples two times a day.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, I\u2019m such an honoured guest.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was because he ate golden apples two times a day. It was a treatment that not even normal Gods could receive.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat would anyone say, even if they give you a whole bunch? You are none other than Idun\u2019s warrior.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was also thanks to Idun, who had strongly claimed that there was no problem with using her apples however she wanted.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, let\u2019s leave the meal for later\u2026 but what did you mean by you still having some time?\u201d asked Tae Ho, tilting his head.</p><br/><p>Ragnar put on a nice smile and answered, \u201cOdin has called for you. Everyone expected that you would be waking up today. He will probably speak about what reward to give.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m curious about what reward he has prepared.\u2019</p><br/><p>Odin had told Tae Ho that everytime he made an accomplishment that he would give a big reward when the thing going on in Valhalla was organized.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn was as curious as Tae Ho but he would know about it only when he met him. Because of that, he decided to ask about other things.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Ragnar, what is the situation of the battle?\u201d</p><br/><p>For now, the battle in Valhalla was a huge victory. Thanks to the magician king and the world wolf having died, the giant kings started to flee and the formation of the giants became a mess.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho had lost consciousness after he defeated the world wolf but the battle on that day continued for half a day. It was an obvious result as it was a battle that had involved hundreds of thousands of warriors.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe giants that escaped scattered everywhere but most of them headed to the north, where Harmarti is at. They had to do that in order to escape to Jotunheim.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar moved his hands in the air as if there was an invisible map in the air while he explained. Compared to before, Tae Ho now had Asgard\u2019s general outline in his head so a picture of it was naturally drawn in his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe army, which is currently led by Heimdall, is chasing after the remaining forces. Odin is planning to gather the forces of Valhalla to defeat the army of Harmarti. They will be driving away the giants from Asgard completely.\u201d</p><br/><p>The battle in Valhalla ended but the Great War itself hadn\u2019t. Tae Ho nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t be able to lower our guards. It can be said that the main force of the giants resides in Harmarti.\u201d</p><br/><p>Strictly speaking, the army of the magician king was a detached force meant to attack Valhalla. But of course, the size and strength of it was too strong to say that it was a detached force.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, but our main forces are also over there. In addition, the hegemony has passed over to Valhalla now that the army of the magician king broke up. The frost giant king would also be thinking about how to retreat while taking all the forces he could.\u201d</p><br/><p>The balance of strength broke with the collapse of the army of the magician king. The army of Harmarti would only be able to fall back.</p><br/><p>\u201cReaching a complete conclusion won\u2019t be easy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe damages Valhalla suffered are too big. Actually, we accomplished great victory in his battle but too much blood has been shed. It will be impossible to counterattack in Jotunheim instantly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho didn\u2019t know of it but the God of sea Njord had suffered a big injury. In addition, there are too many dead warriors and Valkyries. Almost a fourth of the Steel warriors residing in Valhalla have been destroyed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, whatever the case it\u2019s clear that we were the ones that won so you don\u2019t have to worry too much. It seems like they came.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar spoke of something different in the last sentence and turned to look away. Tae Ho also looked at that direction and footsteps were heard from the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you awake master?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho master!\u201d</p><br/><p>They were Adenmaha and Nidhogg. Contrary to Adenmaha, that entered the room calmly, Nidhogg smiled brightly as a puppy meeting her owner in a long time and embraced Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeda is not here. This is the moment. This is the only opportunity.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg rubbed her cheek on Tae Ho\u2019s chest as if she really missed it. But it couldn\u2019t last long either.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeda is not here but I am.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha spoke and Nidhogg flinched. But she still embraced him more tightly as if she wouldn\u2019t be able to step back away.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha shook her head as if she couldn\u2019t do anything and Tae Ho laughed at that. He stroke Nidhogg\u2019s head and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cNidhogg, I\u2019m really grateful. You did really well. You are the best.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEhehe, hehe. Keep complimenting me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou fought well and endured it well. Everyone should be grateful towards you. I\u2019m also grateful.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was being sincere. Nidhogg fought really well. It wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to say that he was able to defeat the World Wolf thanks to Nidhogg\u2019s battle.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg smiled foolishly with her red face. Adenmaha pouted her lips at that look that happiness was overflowing.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have anything to say to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m also grateful to you. I\u2019m always thankful. You really are the best.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, you always say that everything is the best.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha snorted like always but it seemed like she was in a good mood.</p><br/><p>\u2018Nidhogg is also cute today.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn spoke with a really loose voice. Ragnar opened his mouth once again while Tae Ho agreed to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like it\u2019s time. Adenmaha, I will borrow Tae Ho for a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are going to meet Odin-nim right? I will be waiting for you at Idun\u2019s sanctum.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun\u2019s sanctum?\u201d</p><br/><p>The one that asked was Tae Ho. Adenmaha nodded and explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe residence broke in pieces. We are currently using Idun-nim\u2019s sanctum that is inside of Valhalla as the temporary base for the legion.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the seal of Valhalla broke, Freya gave up on part of the lake of fog where the residences were at. It was because she was already full with just protecting Valhalla.</p><br/><p>Odin had also agreed that Freya\u2019s judgement was logical so they had left the lake of fog alone and thanks to that, the lake of fog could only become part of the battlefield.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, this bedroom is inside Freya-nim\u2019s sanctum. Idun-nim also collapsed after the battle\u2026..so Freya-nim said that she would move you to her sanctum for now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Freya-nim still takes care of you and Heda quite well.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m always grateful to her. It\u2019s the same for this battle.\u2019</p><br/><p>At the last moment she had also acted as an outstanding shield.</p><br/><p>\u201cANyways, let\u2019s leave now. Odin shall be waiting for us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar said. Tae Ho stood up while still holding the regretting Nidhogg.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>The place they moved to while being led by Ragnar was a small room instead of a big hall. There were three people waiting in this room and they were respectively Odin, Freya and Idun.</p><br/><p>Odin and Freya were seated in a high place and Idun was standing in the entrance.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho shared a short greeting with Idun and then expressed etiquette in front of Odin.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe commander of Idun greets you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave the solid solid etiquette. It\u2019s an unofficial place so act comfortable like usual.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho and Odin had spoken comfortably while climbing the world tree. It wasn\u2019t a really comfortable relationship but didn\u2019t have a relationship that they had to share hard etiquette.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho put a comfortable posture after thanking his consideration and Odin opened his mouth again.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a conventionality but\u2026..you have also achieved great merits this time. I thank you as the highest God of Asgard.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was seated but Odin expressed etiquette politely. And Tae Ho also answered back to the highest God.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was short and awkward but he couldn\u2019t think of other words besides that. Odin smiled in a good mood and then buried his body in his seat.</p><br/><p>The silent Freya spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou heard the general outline of the situation from Ragnar, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I heard that you were preparing to fight against Harmarti.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Thor\u2019s army is already fighting him and Odin will also head to the north after this conversation ends.\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya spoke kindly like when she spoke with Idun. She always spoke in a stiff way the times they met previously so you could say that it was quite a big change.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to say that we will have to delay the official award granting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho answered hurriedly at Odin\u2019s apology.</p><br/><p>Freya snickered and added.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to participate in this battle. It will become a big battle\u2026.but it\u2019s not like Valhalla\u2019s fate lies in it. I recommend you resting in the rear. In addition, this is also a claim made by Idun.\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya looked at the silent Idun. Idun, that was wearing her eye cover, smacked her lips and said in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you do enough?\u201d</p><br/><p>He raised the biggest merits and had suffered that much.</p><br/><p>Idun recommended Tae Ho to rest rather than go to the battlefield once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand. I will do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Goddess of his legion was this concerned about him so how will he go out to fight?</p><br/><p>Idun got satisfied at Tae Ho\u2019s answer and smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, let\u2019s return to the topic of the award. Freya?\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya received Odin\u2019s gaze and then nodded and spoke with an elegant yet playful eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have been thinking of several things but what about this? I will let you marry Idun formally.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho and Idun got bewildered at the same time at the sudden proposal. But Freya didn\u2019t stop and continued speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Midgard\u2019s common sense for the knight that defeated the black dragon and rescued the princess to marry her right? How about it? It\u2019s not bad right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait!\u201d</p><br/><p>Idun yelled sharply. She interrupted Freya\u2019s words immediately and yelled in an angry voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, how is that an award? We can ju, just marry ourselves later. Isn\u2019t, isn\u2019t that right? My, my warrior Tae Ho? Right?\u201d</p><br/><p>She had started yelling in an angry voice but her voice sunk the more she spoke.</p><br/><p>Idun glanced at Tae Ho with a completely red face and Tae Ho got bewildered once again. He opened his mouth with difficulty.</p><br/><p>\u201cP, probably?\u201d</p><br/><p>They just had to marry just like Idun had said.</p><br/><p>\u2018But aren\u2019t Heda and Idun-nim two different people?\u2019</p><br/><p>Heda had said that it was like having two souls in a single body.</p><br/><p>Idun got embarrassed but it seemed like she was quite satisfied at Tae Ho\u2019s answer. You could see that the corner of her lips kept curling up.</p><br/><p>\u201cTch, not biting it. I wondered if I could just get over it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya clicked her tongue and spoke and because of that Idun got aware of herself and yelled.</p><br/><p>\u201cFreya unnie!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Hey, just say that you want to marry Freya-nim. Won\u2019t it be an award then?\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn didn\u2019t discern time and place and butted in. Idun continued speaking while Tae Ho cleared his throat.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways! Give us a proper award and don\u2019t try to look for a free ride!\u201d</p><br/><p>She had to take Tae Ho\u2019s share properly. Freya pouted her lips as Idun showed a solid resolution and Odin laughed and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun\u2019s warrior. Just like it was proved in this battle you are\u2026.the successor of Erin. That\u2019s why it\u2019s proper to return these to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Odin paused for a moment and spread his palm. Then, a huge illusion of a treasure vault appeared on his palm.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will hand over the treasures of Erin Asgard is in possession of. And\u2026.I will give you a part of Asgard to you so that Erin can rebuild itself once again. That land will be treated as Erin even if it\u2019s inside of Asgard and you will become the owner of that land. No one will be able to surpass your authority in that place.\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t simply handing over a piece of land. He was saying that he would make a small Erin inside of Asgard.</p><br/><p>In addition, Odin had used the expression that no one would be able to surpass his authority in that place. That meant that the authority of the king of Erin, that\u2019s inside of Asgard, will be on equal grounds with him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He answered shortly but there was gratefulness at the exceptional treatment. Odin nodded and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will tell you the land candidates to you when the situation calms down a little. I will also hand over the treasures stored in the treasure vault soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease understand even if it takes a while. Everyone is busy with the clearance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya added. Idun stepped forward and butted in while Tae Ho answered yes.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Freya unnie. Don\u2019t you have something else besides the land and treasure vault? The land is one thing but it\u2019s obvious for the treasures of Erin to return to the successor.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was indeed the case if you look at it from another perspective.</p><br/><p>Now that Asgard had recognized Erin\u2019s authority, the treasures of Erin weren\u2019t artifacts without owner anymore. It belonged to the successor of Erin Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>It belonged to Tae Ho in the first place but to say that it was a prize. It wasn\u2019t improper at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at you. Aren\u2019t you too much?\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya spoke with a dumbfounded face. Idun\u2019s words were true looking at logic, but that was only when looking at logic.</p><br/><p>Realistically speaking the treasures had already entered Asgard\u2019s hands. They were giving those away so how was that no award?</p><br/><p>But Idun still shook her head?</p><br/><p>\u201cWHat are you speaking about? It\u2019s an obvious right. If Tae Ho wasn\u2019t here Valhalla would have collapsed already. You also admit that, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Right! So tell her that you want to marry Freya-nim!\u201d</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn\u2019s intrusion was as sudden and sharp as always. Tae Ho barely forced the cough that was about to come out and Idun and Freya stared at each other. In the end, Freya gave up first and clicked her tongue while dropping her shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cTch, can\u2019t do anything then. Do you have anything else that you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>SHe asked to Tae Ho instead of Idun. Odin added as he didn\u2019t answer immediately.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun\u2019s warrior, you can think about it slowly. You shouldn\u2019t feel troubled when you are the one receiving the award.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a benign voice but Freya grumbled once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Odin. How much are you planning on giving him? You didn\u2019t forget that i\u2019m the one doing the housekeeping, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could I. But don\u2019t you also know well that there are times that you should save your pocket and times that you shouldn\u2019t?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just like Idun had said, if it wasn\u2019t for Tae Ho Valhalla and Asgard would have been destroyed. It didn\u2019t make sense to save treasures to the savior.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, I put my mind on this. I will pick about 20 of the prettiest and nice girls in the Valkyrie training center and send them to your legion. You like it right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya put on a gentle smile. It seemed like it was to tease them rather than being the actual award.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it one bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Idun spoke back as expected. Freya shrugged her shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know if your warrior may like it or not.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, this Tae Ho bastard would certainly like it.\u2019</p><br/><p>Idun turned to look at Tae Ho while Cuchulainn agreed. Tae Ho put a smile to tell her not to worry and spoke to Freya.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine for now. Rather than sending them all at once\u2026.I think that it would be good to send them based on the speed the numer of warriors in the legion increases. It would be good if you gave me a right to select the Valkyries first. You said that they would be twenty so I will be waiting for them.\u201d</p><br/><p>It meant that the 20 best graduates of the Valkyrie training center would all be monopolized for a period of time.</p><br/><p>But of course, the will of the Valkyrie herself was more important but the recognition of Idun\u2019s legion has surged up to the sky with the recent events. Normal Valkyries wouldn\u2019t deny the proposal to enter Idun\u2019s legion.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really are meant for each other.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Right. How did you interpret that so you only take the benefits?\u2019</p><br/><p>Freya and Cuchulainn admired them and Idun broadened her shoulders and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy warrior is excellent.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was too cute to see her boast in a proud way.</p><br/><p>Freya ended up giggling in the end and Odin also laughed at that.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite a pleasing conversation but we will have to end it here. It was nice to see you even if it was for a moment. Idun\u2019s warrior. Think of your award until the official award place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will do so.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe ceremony of being promoted to the top rank will take place in no time. You don\u2019t need me explaining about it right? As you already have good teachers.\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya added and looked at Ragnar that was in a corner.</p><br/><p>Odin also spoke to Ragnar.</p><br/><p>\u201cRagnar, I will also entrust the general explanation about \u2018that\u2019. I will tell him the details myself later but Idun\u2019s warrior also has to know the general details.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho got curious about what \u2018that\u2019 was but he held back himself. He would be able to hear it later in the explanation anyways.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, I will be waiting for the day we meet again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Odin laughed and lightly hit his chest with his fist.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Asgard and the nine realms.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Asgard and the nine realms.\u201d</p><br/><p>The short talk with Odin came to an end.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>\u2018So, when are you going to have the ceremony?\u2019</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 46 \u2013 Idun\u2019s (2) &gt; End</p><hr/><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/><p>Episode 46/Chapter 3: Idun\u2019s (3)</p><br/><p>TL: Tsubak</p><br/><p>ED: Ren</p><hr/><br/><p>\u2018So when are you going to have the ceremony?\u2019</p><br/><p>As soon as they left the room, Cuchulainn asked in a quiet voice. Tae Ho flinched at that surprise attack and asked back unconsciously.</p><br/><p>\u2018W, wedding?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018No, the ceremony for the top rank warrior. Ah, so that was the case. Tae Ho wanted to marry Idun-nim hurriedly. So hat was the case.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn laughed as if it had turned out according to his plan and imitated Heda. It seemed like he used the vague word on purpose to tease him.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho let out a sigh inwardly at his prank and then Idun opened her mouth carefully.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, um. M, my warrior Tae Ho.\u201d</p><br/><p>She stuttered. Her cheeks under her eye cover were still red.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho also got nervous like her and turned to look at her while flinching and Idun slightly evaded his eyes and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I will have to go first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026..uh, yes. Okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018The two of you went so haywire.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn\u2019s interpretation was correct. Idun stuttered once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, yeah. A, and\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>And also indecisive.</p><br/><p>She smacked her lips a few times and then shook her head and spoke with a low tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s speak later. Ye, yes. Later at the sanctum. Anyways, later. Kyak!\u201d</p><br/><p>She, who was walking while speaking ambiguously, was about to fall on the plain ground. Tae Ho was perplexed because he thought he saw this scene before and Idun who was more bewildered than him said quickly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m, I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m fine so don\u2019t worry. I am fine indeed. Ye, yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Idun waved her hand and then started to rush away. Thinking about it, it seemed like it was the first time he saw Idun walking that way.</p><br/><p>Ragnar shook his head with a sigh as Tae Ho was looking at Idun\u2019s back getting farther away with a dumbfounded face.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of expression I should put on at times like these.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Just think that you can laugh.\u2019</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Cuchulainn\u2019s voice didn\u2019t reach Ragnar. Ragnar let out a few more sighs and then turned to look at the still perplexed Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho, take some breaths for now. Inhale at one and exhale at two.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar gave some orders to him.</p><br/><p>Whatever the case, Tae Ho\u2019s expression turned much better after breathing. His excited face also returned to normal.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you calm down?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>For now.</p><br/><p>Ragnar frowned at Tae Ho\u2019s answer but he didn\u2019t say anything else as it seemed impossible to make him calm down any further. So he brought out a completely different subject.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, I have to explain many things to you\u2026\u2026the conversation will likely be long so do you want to go to another place first?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnother place?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCompared to you, your allies will be participating in the next battle. Today is the day if you want to see their faces since they will be departing tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was talking about Siri, Bracky and the Valkyries that had a deep relationship with him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I will see Siri and Bracky first.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had heard that the two of them were safe from Adenmaha but he would be at ease only when he saw them directly.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, then I will go to Idun\u2019s sanctum first. See you later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar patted on Tae Ho\u2019s shoulders lightly and walked away in the opposite direction Idun had. Tae Ho calmed down himself and Cuchulainn asked him.</p><br/><p>\u2018But hey. Do you know where the guys are at?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cI can just ask.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tea Ho took out a summoning rock from the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cAdenmaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLullaby~ And good night~ in the skies stars are bright~ master?\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha, who was humming in a low voice, was surprised and turned around to look at Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha was summoned in a sitting position as if she was sitting somewhere before being summoned so Tae Ho hurriedly grabbed her and then asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026.a lullaby?\u201d</p><br/><p>The reason he was surprised was because he was seeing Adenmaha sing for the first time.</p><br/><p>It seemed like she was singing a lullaby judging by her humming sound, the melody and the lyrics.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha flushed at Tae Ho\u2019s question and then answered while pouting.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was putting down Nidhogg to take her nap.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou also sing lullabies?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho blinked once again and asked. It was surprising for Adenmaha to take care of Nidhogg\u2019s nap and more so for her to also sing a lullaby.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, well\u2026\u2026I can do it for her why are you acting that way?\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha spoke with a quite prim air. It seemed like it was to hide her embarrassment.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn put on a warm smile at that.</p><br/><p>\u2018How nice, nice. She\u2019s a real sucker.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018How is that related to each other?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know. Anyways, she\u2019s nice. Really nice. But doesn\u2019t she have to return quickly if she was putting her to sleep? Nidhogg should be confused now.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was quite understandable. He could imagine Nidhogg\u2019s teary face.</p><br/><p>It seemed like Adenmaha also thought of the same thing as she spoke before Tae Ho could even ask.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about Nidhogg. She always pesters me to sing a lullaby everyday but she falls asleep even before I finish some verses. I was just finishing the song so she must be deep asleep by now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho also knew that Nidhogg was the type that fell asleep as soon as she lied down. She may be in another world by now just as Adenmaha had said.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways, what happened? Did you finish speaking with Odin-nim? What did he say he would give you as an award?\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha\u2019s eyes that requested for more awards became the same as Idun\u2019s. Tae Ho smiled bitterly and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t finish speaking completely. I will tell you the details later as I also have to debate it with you anyways.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDebate?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe told me to think about what I want. But what he promised me for now\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c20 Valkyries?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha opened her eyes sharply and raised her voice. Tae Ho was currently holding Gae Bolg in his hands even though he had no memory of grabbing it so he was certain it was Cuchulainn\u2019s doing.</p><br/><p>\u2018What? It\u2019s true.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn spoke shamelessly and Tae Ho explained quickly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will be getting the top 20 graduates. But what\u2019s more important than that is the land and the treasures.\u201d</p><br/><p>The land to set up Erin and the treasures of Erin.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha finished listening to Tae Ho\u2019s explanation and then opened her eyes roundly and was happy.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, they are giving more on top of that? Well, you did accomplish a great merit. Yes, right. You have plenty of rights. Yes yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her getting excited and boasting as if it was her own doing was exactly the same as a certain someone.</p><br/><p>\u2018She\u2019s so similar to Idun-nim.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn\u2019s words were certain as usual. It was indeed the insight that came from Scathach\u2019s style techniques.</p><br/><p>\u201cErin\u2026..Merlin will like it. Scathach too.\u201d</p><br/><p>A warm smile spread on Adenmaha\u2019s face. Tae Ho felt warm at that smile and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cAdenmaha, what about you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI also like it. I think that you keep forgetting this but I\u2019m also a Goddess of Erin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, anyways, let\u2019s speak the details at a later time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways\u2026..you really lack delicateness. So what is the reason you called me anyways?\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha also asked using the word anyways. Tae Ho put back the summoning rock and then revealed the reason he called Adenmaha.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know where Siri and Bracky are at? And the Valkyries of the other legions. I want to see them before they depart.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha pouted when he said that he wanted to see the Valkyries but she started to think back and remember.</p><br/><p>\u201cSiri and Bracky should be resting at the conference room by now\u2026. and the other Valkyries may be at the sanctums of their respective legions. Ah, also\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, don\u2019t get surprised when you hear this. The other Valkyries\u2026\u2026so to say Rasgrid, Reginleif and Gandur are well but actually Ingrid suffered some injuries. They\u2019re not too severe so don\u2019t worry. This is why I\u2019m telling you not to be surprised\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha frowned and let out a sigh but Tae Ho asked quickly while opening his eyes widely.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not as it is an injury, but it isn\u2019t threatening to her life at all. I know that she\u2019s resting at the sanctum of her legion so calm down.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. Let\u2019s go meet Ingrid first then.\u201d</p><br/><p>The usually calm and sincere Ingrid.</p><br/><p>She seemed to be hard on people but that was because she wasn\u2019t skilled at dealing with people. She was really a gentle Valkyrie.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho still worried about her even though he had heard that her life wasn\u2019t in danger. He wanted to check how she was doing as soon as he could.</p><br/><p>But Adenmaha stopped Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cSiri and Bracky should be on the way so you should go see them first. Just like I told you before, her life isn\u2019t in danger so calm down. You know what I mean right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFine. Let\u2019s move then. Follow me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha grabbed Tae Ho\u2019s arm naturally and started to lead the way.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>\u201cOhh, Idun\u2019s warrior!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun\u2019s warrior!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe warrior that had a Valkyrie meet him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe warrior that rides on Valkyries!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGiant slayer!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe one that defeated the magician king!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe calamity of the World Wolf!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Valkyrie Master!\u201d</p><br/><p>Those were the voices that were heard from the surroundings as Tae Ho entered the conference room.</p><br/><p>Their yells were so loud it shook the entire conference room and Cuchulainn mumbled with a sick voice.</p><br/><p>\u2018The warriors of Valhalla really like to make nicknames.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was at that moment that a huge man that was a head bigger than the others approached Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBracky! Siri!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho smiled brightly and said. Bracky and Siri were also putting on the same bright face.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hug for now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bracky gave a fierce hug to Tae Ho suddenly. Tae Ho experienced that his body was getting crushed and then hugged Bracky back.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you are safe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m also glad that you are safe.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho\u2019s hug was filled with emotions compared to Bracky\u2019s hug. Bracky saw Tae Ho and Siri hugging each other and then slightly pulled on Tae Ho\u2019s shoulders and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that you passed out and couldn\u2019t wake up but will you also be participating?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m going to rest this time. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy be sorry? It\u2019s also time for you to rest. No, you should rest a few more times. Only then will I be able to catch up to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bracky was much stronger than Tae Ho when they were at the lowest rank. But Tae Ho had become a lot stronger in no time.</p><br/><p>But thinking about it, Bracky and Siri were also amazing as they were catching up to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou became strong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho was amazed after he looked at Bracky and Siri with his \u2018eyes of the dragon\u2019. The two of them had accumulated twice the runes they had since he saw them in Midgard.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe fought with strong enemies. But of course, it isn\u2019t be as much as you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them had fought against giant kings but still, they couldn\u2019t be compared to Tae Ho who had fought against the magician king and the World Wolf.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou will become superior ranked warriors, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not enough but\u2026..I think that we will become soon. Then, you will become a top ranked warrior?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho smirked and answered Siri\u2019s question. Bracky laughed once again and then spoke while embracing Siri by her shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are the pride of our knight. Right Siri?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not yours. It seems like you keep forgetting this but I\u2019m your senior by a lot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri glanced at him and surprisingly enough, she didn\u2019t push away Bracky\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho opened his eyes sharply and Cuchulainn laughed wickedly. Meanwhile, Bracky leaned his face close to Siri\u2019s and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cEy, what meaning does that have between us?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a vague voice. Siri put on an expression as she didn\u2019t like it but it didn\u2019t seem like she really disliked him.</p><br/><p>\u2018What an estimation.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn said and Tae Ho agreed to his words. Adenmaha\u2019s eyes also shone.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe two of you\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhuhu, you noticed? Did you notice?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bracky spoke triumphantly. Siri let out a sigh but then put a smile as if she couldn\u2019t do anything about it.</p><br/><p>Not being negative but positive.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho asked hurriedly while his interest peaked up.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did it become like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhuhu\u2026.that is when he got dispatched to Mdigard. When Odin disappeared and everything fell in chaos\u2026.we, that overcame all kinds of dangers, becoming closer every time. But one day, when the rain fell down heavily\u2026\u2026ack!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bracky, who was having fun talking, leaned over and grabbed his shin. Siri punched Bracky in the stomach after making him lower his body by kicking him in the shin and said with a sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s say that what happened that day was certainly a mistake.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Hey, ask if it happened that day or at night. Hurry.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was the stubborn Cuchulainn.</p><br/><p>And in the other side, Bracky spoke in a tricky voice as if he didn\u2019t receive any damage.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t be shy\u2026.ugh!\u201d</p><br/><p>He got hit one more time. It seemed like he got hit properly and couldn\u2019t utter a word.</p><br/><p>And after some time passed.</p><br/><p>Time flowed really quickly because it was fun just to be with them.</p><br/><p>\u201cCaptain Siri, have a safe trip. Don\u2019t over do it. And if possible take care of Bracky too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you to not call me capt\u2026..right, let\u2019s meet at the promotion ceremony.\u201d</p><br/><p>For Tae Ho, captain Siri was none other than a nickname.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho shared a hug with Siri and then turned to look at Bracky.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou too, have a safe trip. I will entrust captain Siri to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. It may be impossible to protect the tip of her hair but I won\u2019t let her get hurt.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho also shared a hug with Bracky and then left the conference room. Then, Cuchulainn clicked his tongue and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u2018Poor Rolph. You don\u2019t even ask about him anymore. He could also be considered as a comrade.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ah, now that you mention him.\u2019</p><br/><p>He had completely forgotten about him. Rolph must have also participated in this battle. Nothing would have happened, right?</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, he should be safe. Siri would definitely have told you if something did happen. Anyways, she said that she thought about him as her younger brother. Um, younger brother. He\u2019s somewhat poor.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018But he\u2019s still handsome. He will get a new relation.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho finished speaking to Cuchulainn and walked away to meet with Ingrid.</p><br/><p>\u201cCommander-nim?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a meeting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho went to the injured ward as soon as he entered Njord\u2019s sanctum and smirked. It seemed like Ingrid was receiving quite good treatment since she was given a one man room.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for visiting me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEy, I told you not to use formal language in informal occasions.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ingrid rose up with difficulty and Tae Ho helped her raise herself.</p><br/><p>Ingrid sat with difficulty and then spoke while laughing after hesitating for a bit.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to see you safe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too. Do you know how surprised I was when I heard that you got injured?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will get better after I rest a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should. And here.\u201d</p><br/><p>She had bandages wrapped all over her body but it seemed like the problem was internal rather than external. Because of that, Tae Ho took out something he had saved.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, that\u2019s\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTake it. No, eat it. It\u2019s a piece anyways. Don\u2019t feel troubled by it.\u201d</p><br/><p>A piece of a golden apple. It was one of the many Idun had prepared for the fight against the magician king.</p><br/><p>It was a piece but still it wasn\u2019t something a Valkyrie could eat easily. Ingrid hesitated for a moment and then put a faint smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you. I will eat it gratefully.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you are grateful, get cured completely.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a bit stiff but her smile was warm as usual.</p><br/><p>And after some time passed.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet Idun\u2019s blessing accompany you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet Njord\u2019s blessing accompany you.\u201d</p><br/><p>They blessed each other in their foreheads and put a smile at the same time.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like you had many places to visit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt somehow turned out that way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Is it to increase the completion rate of your saga or your heart is black? I want to know that.\u2019</p><br/><p>Because he had met all the Valkyries he knew.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha was putting sharp eyes as if she was thinking of the same thing as Cuchulainn and then let out a long sigh and spoke to Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will be going to Nidhogg then. It\u2019s about time she woke up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018SHe\u2019s a real mom.\u2019</p><br/><p>Looking at how she cared for Nidhogg, she looked more like a mom rather than an unnie.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho agreed to Cuchulainn\u2019s words like usual and turned to look at Ragnar.</p><br/><p>Ragnar pointed to a secluded direction with his chin.</p><br/><p>\u201cShall we start our conversation over there?\u201d</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 46 \u2013 Idun\u2019s (3) &gt; End</p><br/>\n</div>"}

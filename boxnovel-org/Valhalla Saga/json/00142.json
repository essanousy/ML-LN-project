Why is it so big?\u201d</p><br/><p>Her bewildered voice came out unavoidably.</p><br/><p>The body of the black dragon, Nidhogg.</p><br/><p>The body presented an overwhelming force to the ones looking at it even though it was only lying down.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha had faced quite a lot of hardships as a Goddess of the Tuatha De Danann, but it was her first time seeing a dragon this big.</p><br/><p>Beside her, Nidhogg felt happy as Adenmaha exclaimed sincerely. She laughed stupidly and then spread her arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe real deal is bigger than that. Muuuuuch more bigger.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because Nidhogg\u2019s real body stretched 2 kilometers. From a simple glance, it was twenty times bigger than the dragon before them, so it was easily ten times bigger.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg spread her arms trying to express how huge it was, but she didn\u2019t stop there and also stood on her toes. Of course, there was no way she\u2019d be able to accurately transmit the size, but Adenmaha still admired the fact that it was much bigger.</p><br/><p>\u201cBigger than that? And by a lot?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes. Much, much bigger.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg answered hurriedly and thought of other methods to express hugeness, but she couldn\u2019t think of anything.</p><br/><p>And that was the same for Adenmaha.</p><br/><p>She just looked up at the body of Nidhogg with her dumbfounded face and let out sounds of admiration.</p><br/><p>\u201c<i>Haa</i>. How amazing. Really incredible.\u201d</p><br/><p>She had just accepted the fact that Tae Ho had defeated an army of the giants while riding upon Nidhogg, but now she could understand it certainly.</p><br/><p>With a body that big, it would be able to create catastrophe and turmoil just by rolling on the ground.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha thought of when she had to roll in the Winter Tree Forest of Kataron.</p><br/><p>The day she had to roll to take care of the moving trees in an instant.</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t Nidhogg also roll on the battlefield?</p><br/><p>\u2018Hey, no way.\u2019</p><br/><p>She shook her head reflexively at the mental image of a dragon that was a hundred meters long rolling over a battlefield. She convinced herself that not even Tae Ho would make Nidhogg do something like that.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways, you really are amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg scratched her head as Adenmaha exclaimed once again and didn\u2019t know what to do. She laughed like a fool and then slightly pulled on Adenmaha\u2019s clothes.</p><br/><p>\u201cAdenmaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you do it a bit more?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg said hesitantly while flushing. Adenmaha tilted her head because she couldn\u2019t understand what she was saying, but she soon understood.</p><br/><p>What Nidhogg wanted.</p><br/><p>The words Ratatoskr didn\u2019t tell her.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha smiled brightly. She spread her arms widely and said energetically,</p><br/><p>\u201cIncredible. Our Nidhogg is amazing, big and beautiful!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ratatoskr had only told her that she was big and a fool.</p><br/><p>It had only told her that she was uselessly big.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg also thought like that. She could only do so.</p><br/><p>But that wasn\u2019t the case now.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha had told her that she was amazing. Instead of cursing her that she was big and a fool, she had praised that her body was big and beautiful.</p><br/><p>\u201c<i>Ehehehe.</i>\u201d</p><br/><p>Laughter kept coming out. Her face felt hot, but she couldn\u2019t stop laughing.</p><br/><p>And what came out wasn\u2019t only laughter. Her eyes started to redden, and tears fell down unconsciously as well.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha aimed a silent smile at Nidhogg. She smirked instead of wiping off Nidhogg\u2019s tears and then expressed her admiration more energetically.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow are you this amazing? Really, really amazing. You are so amazing, I can\u2019t stop admiring.\u201d</p><br/><p>She spoke gently as if complimenting a kid.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg couldn\u2019t endure it anymore and embraced Adenmaha.</p><br/><p>\u201cI like Adenmaha a lot!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too. Me too, Nidhogg.\u201d (ED Note: Narcissism much, Adenmaha?)</p><br/><p>Adenmaha patted Nidhogg\u2019s back. Although Nidhogg was 10cm taller than her, no matter who saw them, the one that got hugged this time was Nidhogg.</p><br/><p>Not a dislike but a I like you.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg bit her lips and then burst into tears.</p><br/><p>She was crying so sorrowfully that she began soaking Adenmaha\u2019s clothes, but she didn\u2019t push her back. She rather hugged her more warmly.</p><br/><p>And Cuchulainn, that was looking that from a distant place, said as his eyes became red,</p><br/><p>\u2018How nice and warm. It\u2019s so nice and warm that I don\u2019t need a stove at all.\u2019</p><br/><p>Nidhogg was one case, but Cuchulainn had grown amazed of Adenmaha.</p><br/><p>He had only seen her assuming a prim air in front of Tae Ho, but for her to be a woman overflowing with motherly love\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u2018A Goddess is still a Goddess in the end.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn smirked once again. It was because he remembered Adenmaha\u2019s past when she had chosen to become the slave of Bress the Tyrant by her own decision to save the citizens of Erin.</p><br/><p>Hela, who didn\u2019t know much about Nidhogg compared to the other two, looked at Nidhogg with surprise written over her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cI could have never imagined that the black dragon was like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was even more so as she had seen her fight valiantly in the battlefield.</p><br/><p>Odin smiled bitterly.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, that was also the case for me. I only guessed that it would be an evil and wicked existence.\u201d</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t been able to realize it even though he had heard Nidhogg\u2019s cry filled with sorrow.</p><br/><p>Odin took a deep breath and turned to look at Hela.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre the preparations going well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have finished everything. I will lead the Naglfar whenever you give the order and head to Asgard.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were already dozens of Naglfars prepared, ships made with the claws and nails of the dead.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a relief to hear.\u201d</p><br/><p>The individual strength of the dead was certainly weak. They were beings that couldn\u2019t even fight properly against the giants, but the story changed when their numbers reached the hundred thousands. Even though it would still be impossible to face the giants, it wasn\u2019t impossible to face the evil spirits.</p><br/><p>\u201cOdin, are you going to the highest branch right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m planning to do so. There\u2019s no reason to delay any further.\u201d</p><br/><p>They had to rather hurry. He had gathered a bit of information from Niflheim and Midgard, but he still didn\u2019t have any detailed information regarding Asgard.</p><br/><p>Odin answered immediately Hela\u2019s question and then turned to look at Tae Ho who was standing next to Merlin.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun\u2019s warrior.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Odin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHraesvelg is the protector and the king of the highest branch. He will probably show himself when he sees us approach.\u201d</p><br/><p>And Nidhogg was especially in the group. He\u2019d never met Nidhogg even once since he\u2019d been born, but he should know of her characteristics, like her four pair of wings and four horns, through Ratatoskr.</p><br/><p>It was obvious he would come charging when he heard that a black dragon had appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will proceed with the negotiations just like I said before, but the thing after that is entirely up to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everything pertaining to defeating Hraesvelg rested on Tae Ho\u2019s shoulders. It wasn\u2019t that Odin had irresponsibly handed the task to him. Odin really trusted Tae Ho that much.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave it to me,\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho hit his chest and answered. Odin remembered the time Tae Ho had appeared to save him and smiled bitterly. He thought of Idun, who\u2019d tried hard to hide Tae Ho from his eyes, and made a hand gesture.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome closer. I will give you a blessing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Oh nice. You like blessings. Get a lot of them. Two at least.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn butted in as if this was the right moment.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho smiled bitterly inwardly and approached Odin and then blessed him on his forehead.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Asgard and the Nine Realms.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Asgard and the Nine Realms.\u201d</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t have time to waste anymore, just like Odin had said. The group then headed toward the highest branch with Ratatoskr as their guide.</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>The World Tree, Yggdrasil, could be said to be a kind of system that was a composition of the world itself.</p><br/><p>Because of that, the World Tree wasn\u2019t only what one could see. The World Tree passing through Niflheim, Midgard, and Asgard was merely the corporeal part of the entire tree.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg knew this fact instinctively. He couldn\u2019t explain it in detail, but he could feel it.</p><br/><p>\u2018There isn\u2019t only one path that leads to the highest branch.\u2019</p><br/><p>There were several other paths that led to the highest branch aside from climbing the materialized tree.</p><br/><p>And the path Ratatoskr used was certainly a path they couldn\u2019t see.</p><br/><p>Because of that, Hraesvelg left watchmen in several parts of the highest branch. It was to drive away anyone approaching the highest branch quickly, be it a God or a giant.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg, who had the appearance of a sturdy, old man, stood on the wide and solitary training center and slowly took a stance.</p><br/><p>He would swing his spear and cut the air horizontally and then vertically, take a turn, and produce a strong slash.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg moved slowly. He used several seconds in only one stance.</p><br/><p>It was a training method human martial artists used when they wanted to increase the preciseness of a movement.</p><br/><p>Actually, it was a meaningless training for Hraesvelg.</p><br/><p>He was a kind of a God, just like the ancient dragon Nidhogg.</p><br/><p>Because of that, although he now had the appearance of an old man, that wasn\u2019t the same for his real body.</p><br/><p>A white eagle that had huge wings that could cover the sky.</p><br/><p>That was Hraesvelg\u2019s real appearance. It was a body that couldn\u2019t use the spear and didn\u2019t even need to use it.</p><br/><p>But Hraesvelg still trained in his spearmanship. It was to become similar to the great hero that remained in his thoughts.</p><br/><p>A clean stab.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg pulled back his spear and let out a long sigh. He should have moved on to the next movement here, but he frowned and turned around. Young sparrows were flying towards him in a hurry.</p><br/><p>\u201cHraesvelg-nim! Hraesvelg-nim!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt appeared! Appeared!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAn infiltrator! Infiltrator!\u201d</p><br/><p>The sparrows flew around Hraesvelg\u2019s head and chirped noisily.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg extended his spear to make a spot for the sparrows to perch upon and then he smiled like a man and asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it the giants?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot a giant nor a God! It\u2019s a dragon!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA black dragon! A black dragon!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA black dragon?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg opened his eyes abruptly and asked back in an absurd tone. The sparrows held their breaths at the strong aura that was suddenly released.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg received a sparrow that\u2019d fallen down as it\u2019d been paralyzed and then calmed down his aura.</p><br/><p>The sparrows were able to barely breathe once again and fluttered their wings.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really big!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt has poison in its body! And has four pair of wings! It also has four horns!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg gulped dry saliva. He barely suppressed the aura that was about to come out reflexively and held his breath.</p><br/><p>Four pair of wings and four horns.</p><br/><p>A black dragon.</p><br/><p>There was only one thing that appeared in his head. And right then, a black and huge bird came flying from far away.</p><br/><p>\u201cHraesvelg-nim!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was Hraesvelg\u2019s aide, Vedrfolnir.</p><br/><p>She usually transformed into a woman of long black hair first to express etiquette, but she didn\u2019t have the leisure to do so this time. She yelled towards Hraesvelg while being in the shape of a bird.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt-It has appeared!\u201d</p><br/><p>If the usually calm Vedrfolnir had gotten this excited, there was only one possible scenario.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe black dragon, Nidhogg.\u201d</p><br/><p>The ancient dragon.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg\u2019s own old enemy that was connected to him by fate.</p><br/><p>His breathing became rough by its own accord. He felt that the beats of his heart had started to shake, and he clenched a fist in anticipation.</p><br/><p>He remembered the fight against the great hero he could still remember clearly when he closed his eyes.</p><br/><p>The excitement from that time surged up naturally, and an equally natural smile was slowly drawn upon his face.</p><br/><p>A final and decisive battle.</p><br/><p>A duel that put the fate of the world in the line.</p><br/><p>The day he had waited for a thousand years!</p><br/><p>He could die in this battle. His opponent was the ancient dragon that resented the world. Perhaps, this may become the last day for Hraesvelg.</p><br/><p>But he had no regrets nor fear.</p><br/><p>If he could pour all he was capable of.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. Lead the way, Vedrfolnir.\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice was strangely calm compared to his hot chest. His eyes were also calm.</p><br/><p>The sparrows\u2019 hearts were moved by the current, hero-esque image of Hraesvelg. Vedrfolnir was about to burst in tears, but she held them back. It was the moment her master had waited his entire life for. She couldn\u2019t scatter her feelings with mere tears.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will lead the way, my loved master. King of the highest branch.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg looked at the sky and took a deep breath. He calmed down his hot ambition that burned like the sun and jumped to the sky.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 41 \u2013 The highest branch (3) &gt; End</p><hr/><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/><p>Episode 41/Chapter 4: The highest branch (4)</p><br/><p>TL: Tsubak</p><br/><p>ED:</p><hr/><br/><p>The highest branch wasn\u2019t a branch like its name implied.</p><br/><p>It was a small world that was stuck to the world tree just like Midgard and Asgard.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg flew in the sky in a majestuous manner. Vedrfolnir flew a bit ahead than him to lead the way and the sparrows that were riding on her back chirped and yelled.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe king is going!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe king is going to fight against the black dragon!\u201d</p><br/><p>The birds that had a good hearing heard them. The birds that were uneasy because of the sudden appearance of the black dragon got happy and flew up. They then followed the track of their king.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg didn\u2019t stop his citizens. It was because it would be better to have more witnesses in the great duel that would take place in a moment.</p><br/><p>But of course, Hraesvelg wasn\u2019t planning on putting his citizens in danger in vain as he was a king. He was planning to not let them approach to a certain range as they could get swept in the battle against Nidhogg.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy king! My king!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOur king!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKing of birds!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe protector of the highest branch!\u201d</p><br/><p>The birds started to gather one by one and yelled together. Hraesvelg was a king that was loved by everyone as he protected the highest branch for a thousand years since he climbed to the throne.</p><br/><p>They knew well about the black dragon Nidhogg thanks to the squirrel beast Ratatoskr.</p><br/><p>The manifestation of all the evil in the world.</p><br/><p>But they weren\u2019t afraid as the white eagle king was with them. They were sure he would defeat a mere black dragon!</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg first headed to the core of the highest branch instead of going to the outer regions where the black dragon had appeared at. It wasn\u2019t to make more citizens follow him. It was because his real body was asleep in that place.</p><br/><p>\u201cWake up my body. The time has come.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Hraesvelg stood in the air and mumbled something, the entire highest branch started to shake. The birds that were gathered were afraid but happy at the same time. They closed their beaks tightly and concentrated.</p><br/><p>A huge flutter of a wing shook the world.</p><br/><p>The two wings that got spread while breaking the silence hit the air once again and Hraesvelg\u2019s original body appeared.</p><br/><p>The eyes of the sparrows that were riding on Vedrfolnir widened and that was the same for the ones that had already seen the real appearance of the king and for the ones that were looking at it for the first time.</p><br/><p>If you connected the extremes of the wings, you could imagine that it was a big and wide plains. It was a huge existence that could create whirlwinds with a stroke of its wind.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg\u2019s original body was a kind of a magic armor just like Nidhogg\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>A pure white eagle that had no stains.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg looked at his own body with a satisfied expression and then took a step. He stepped on the air and then moved to the head of his original body.</p><br/><p>Vedrfolnir transformed into a beautiful woman and stood next to the king and the sparrows sat in her shoulder and praised his greatness.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg fluttered his wings once again. The ground shook once more and the white eagle crossed an incredible distance in a moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the king!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the white eagle king!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe king is going to fight against the black dragon!\u201d</p><br/><p>The citizens of the highest branch yelled with all their strength. They were also really excited right now.</p><br/><p>This was also Ratatoskr\u2019s merit. The citizens imagined their king defeating the black dragon and fluttered their wings even more strongly.</p><br/><p>And Hraesvelg finally reached the outside perimeter along his people. He opened his eyes sharply and looked at the black dragon.</p><br/><p>A black dragon that had four pair of wings and four horns, just like the sparrows had said, was standing still. It looked just like a black and huge mountain.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s smaller than I thought.\u2019</p><br/><p>An eagle was an animal which wings was bigger than its body so just by looking at their size, it didn\u2019t seem like there would be much difference between Hraesvelg and Nidhogg.</p><br/><p>But perhaps, it was an obvious thing. Because Nidhogg was the fated enemy of Hraesvelg. The story would fit if they were of a similar size.</p><br/><p>The dragon that had a poisonous fog around it didn\u2019t move, as if it had really become a mountain. Hraesvelg made his citizens stop and flew ahead alone.</p><br/><p>About 200 meters with Nidhogg.</p><br/><p>It was a really long distance that people wouldn\u2019t be able to speak to each other but it was plentily close for huge existences like Nidhogg and Hraesvelg.</p><br/><p>Based on Ratatoskr\u2019s words, the normal thing would be for the dragon to launch a surprise attack first but it rather waited calmly for him.</p><br/><p>It was a strange thing but Hraesvelg could find out the reason for it.</p><br/><p>\u2018It was also waiting for the destined duel.\u2019</p><br/><p>A smile spread in his mouth by its own.</p><br/><p>RIght, it was a battle against its old enemy connected by fate. No matter how much of an evil creature it was, it would at least want to duel properly.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg stood on the head of his original body and looked at Nidhogg\u2019s head. It was a distance that made people seem like dots but this didn\u2019t impede the eyes of the eagle king at all. He could see the scene of 200 meters ahead as if it was right in front of him.</p><br/><p>There was a black haired warrior standing on the head of Nidhogg.</p><br/><p>A tall stature and trained body. Clear features and a strong resolution in his face.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is that Nidhogg\u2019s essence?\u2019</p><br/><p>And it was at that moment. The one that was estimated to be Nidhogg\u2019s essence opened his mouth and shouted in a loud voice. It seemed like he had used some mystical power that his voice was heard clearly regardless of the distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cKing of birds Hraesvelg! I\u2019m called Lee Tae Ho, the commander of Idun\u2019s legion!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun\u2019s commander? Are you a warrior of Valhalla?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg\u2019s eyebrows twitched. It wasn\u2019t only because his guess that the man was Nidhogg\u2019s essence was wrong.</p><br/><p>Displeasement showed in the voice of Hraesvelg, that looked at honor with importance.</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard! Asgard fell in danger but it seemed that a traitor has appeared! For a warrior of Valhalla to join hands with Nidhogg!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg had no relationship with Valhalla but it didn\u2019t matter. How could a warrior of a God join hands with the evil dragon?</p><br/><p>Treason was especially one of the things Hraesvelg disliked a lot.</p><br/><p>As he looked at the warrior with eyes filled with contempt, Tae Ho answered with his head high as if he didn\u2019t care at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the case! I\u2019m a warrior of Valhalla that fights for Asgard and the nine realms, and the king of Gods Odin will prove this!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true. Idun\u2019s warrior is an outstanding warrior even in Valhalla.\u201d</p><br/><p>Odin, that was seated a bit farther from Tae Ho, said in a low voice. Hraesvelg couldn\u2019t see Odin as he was concentrated on the man estimated to be Nidhogg\u2019s essence and asked in a surprised voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cOdin? You were alive?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI could survive thanks to Idun\u2019s warrior.\u201d</p><br/><p>Odin smiled bitterly and said. His voice and looks didn\u2019t seem to be forced at all.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg got perplexed. He didn\u2019t know about Idun\u2019s warrior but it was hard to imagine the king of Gods to join hands with Nidhogg.</p><br/><p>But this was reality occurring in front of them. Hraesvelg yelled bluntly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine whatever it is. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s the king of Gods Odin or a warrior of Valhalla. The important thing is that the black warrior Nidhogg came to the highest branch!\u201d</p><br/><p>The white eagle Hraesvelg didn\u2019t miss the main point of the problem.</p><br/><p>Only the truth that Nidhogg had infiltrated the highest branch was important.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho nodded. He yelled in a pleasant voice as it was flowing as he wanted to.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are right Hraesvelg. The important thing is Nidhogg. Come greet her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho stood to a side and then, one of the rocks in Nidhogg\u2019s head split up and two people showed up.</p><br/><p>\u2018Women?\u2019</p><br/><p>They were both women. One was a tall and slender woman that had long black hair and the other one was a white haired woman that was dressed with the uniform of Valkyries.</p><br/><p>You could know who was Nidhogg\u2019s essence at a glance.</p><br/><p>The white haired Valkyrie- Adenmaha, stopped at the entrance and the black haired woman- Nidhogg walked ahead.</p><br/><p>But it was at that moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cKyak!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg, that took a step with a stiff expression, was about to fall down. Adenmaha asked hurriedly as she got surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you fine?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYe,yes. I\u2019m fine. I didn\u2019t fall down.\u201d</p><br/><p>For her to almost fall down as she tripped with a rock.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg cleared her throat several times as it was embarrassing and then stood next to Tae Ho with still stiff movements. She then looked at Hraesvelg and waved her hand shyly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, hello? I\u2019m Nidhogg. I wanted to meet you for a while. I also heard many things from Ratatoskr\u2026\u2026Although they weren\u2019t good things, it\u2019s fine as it\u2019s all a misunderstanding. Uh, um\u2026\u2026.ah\u2026hi anyways!\u201d</p><br/><p>She hesitated for a moment and then increased her voice at the last part.</p><br/><p>She even smiled brightly.</p><br/><p>But the reply that Nidhogg wanted didn\u2019t return. Odin turned his head and held his laughter and Tae Ho gritted his teeth to maintain his expression.</p><br/><p>When Nidhogg became dispirited and shrugged her shoulders, a reply came from the side of Hraesvelg.</p><br/><p>It was Vedrfolnir.</p><br/><p>\u201cBastards! You dare to insult the king of the highest branch! You dare bring a fake to this place!\u201d</p><br/><p>There was nothing more evil. How could they bring a childish girl like that and say that she was Nidhogg\u2019s essence!</p><br/><p>Vedrfolnir glared at Tae Ho\u2019s group with eyes filled with displeasement. But something completely unexpected came out from the mouth of Hraesvelg.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s real?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe is really Nidhogg.\u201d</p><br/><p>Vedrfolnir blinked as she didn\u2019t understand what Hraesvelg was saying but he didn\u2019t say anything else. Actually, Hraesvelg also wanted to yell like Vedrfolnir to bring the real deal.</p><br/><p>But he could know.</p><br/><p>Because he was connected to her by fate.</p><br/><p>The one in front of him was Nidhogg indeed. She was the black dragon Nidhogg.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why Hraesvelg decided to think in another perspective. He spoke with the voice he managed to squeeze out.</p><br/><p>\u201cNidhogg, stop acting. I heard that you were an evil existence but you have crossed the line. Your actions right now\u2026.aren\u2019t right manners when facing your destined enemy.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had expected the fated duel while thinking that the dragon was an evil existence but wasn\u2019t it too much that it was acting like that?</p><br/><p>But reality always surpassed your imaginations.</p><br/><p>\u201cNi, Nidhogg didn\u2019t act. I\u2019m\u2026\u2026not evil. Tae Ho master and Adenmaha said that Nidhogg was good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg spoke back while being aware of her surroundings. Adenmaha clenched her fist towards Nidhogg telling her to cheer up but that wasn\u2019t the case for the others. Odin couldn\u2019t endure his laughter and turned around and Tae Ho pinched his thigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cTh, that damned\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Vedrfolnir trembled. She couldn\u2019t endure looking how her loved king got despised anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cNidhogg! I know too well that you have tried to make the world tree fall by eating the roots! How do you dare act as an innocent kid!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t eat the roots. It\u2019s bitter and not tasty. The food Heda or Adenmaha makes are much more delicious.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was true. Nidhogg really disliked eating the roots of the world tree.</p><br/><p>Vedrfolnir staggered. Strength was taken away from her body as Nidhogg\u2019s words were heard sincerely.</p><br/><p>\u201cYo, you bitch! I remember the curses you had told to Hraesvelg-nim!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, uh\u2026.I\u2019m sorry! Ratatoskr forced me to do it. I\u2019m sorry. It said that it would leave if I didn\u2019t\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg started to sob as she was really sorry. Her crying look looked really sad and poor.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, why are you making a kid cry! What did she do wrong!\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha yelled. Vedrfolnir, that was already in a groggy state, put an even dumber face.</p><br/><p>\u201cWh, what?\u201d</p><br/><p>Make a kid cry?</p><br/><p>She wanted to deny it but she couldn\u2019t. Looking at them from a distance, it just looked like Vedrfolnir was a bad girl that made a poor girl cry.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy, my king.\u201d</p><br/><p>Vedrfolnir couldn\u2019t take in the sudden situation and said with a trembling voice. But Hraesvelg also felt the same as her. No, he received a bigger shock than Vedrfolnir.</p><br/><p>\u201cH, how\u2026\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>How is it that she isn\u2019t her old fated enemy?</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t this the duel he had waited for a thousand years?</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg felt dizzy. They hadn\u2019t even started to exchange blows but the strength completely left his body. It felt like the sky turned yellow.</p><br/><p>The sparrows that were sitting in the shoulder of Vedrfolnir got excited at the perplexity of their king. They, that were simple, thought that Nidhogg was acting. They crossed a distance of 200 meters in an instant suitable of being messengers and started to attack Nidhogg.</p><br/><p>\u201cBad girl!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBad girl!\u201d</p><br/><p>But they were still sparrows. The only thing sparrows the size of a fist could do was to fly around Nidhogg\u2019s head and peak it.</p><br/><p>Originally, he had to stop the sparrows. They were weak creatures that could die by one attack of an enraged enemy.</p><br/><p>But there was no need to do so and that fact made Hraesvelg feel more tired.</p><br/><p>\u201cKyak! Don\u2019t! Don\u2019t do it! It hurts! I don\u2019t like things that hurt!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg couldn\u2019t even think about hitting the sparrows and just covered her head.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha and Tae Ho chased away the sparrows in her stead.</p><br/><p>\u201cA, an act\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Vedrfolnir couldn\u2019t finish speaking. Hraesvelg closed his eyes tightly.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t want to see anymore. Didn\u2019t want to hear anymore.</p><br/><p>The fated enemy that was connected to him.</p><br/><p>A destined duel against the devil that threatened the world.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t something like this.</p><br/><p>The duel he had dreamed for a long time wasn\u2019t something like this.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg showed tears in a really long while. They were tears of remorse that flowed down from a deep part of his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy king\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Vedrfolnir also started to cry. She felt like her heart got torn when she looked at her king being sad. She felt so absent minded that she couldn\u2019t even think about Ratatoskr.</p><br/><p>But it was at that moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cHraesvelg!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho yelled once again. He glared at Hraesvelg that turned to look at him reflexively and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need your help to take back Asgard. That\u2019s why I have a proposal to make to you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg, that didn\u2019t even want to think anything by now, didn\u2019t show any reaction.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho yelled once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cI request a duel with you as the commander of Idun. If I win, help us on taking back Asgard. As I am Nidhogg\u2019s master, she will also participate in the duel.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes. I can fight well if it\u2019s with Tae Ho master!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg said. At that moment, Tae Ho activated the \u2018one that controls dragons\u2019 and at that time, the attribute of the aura covering Nidhogg\u2019s body changed.</p><br/><p>The black dragon Nidhogg.</p><br/><p>A strong aura that suited an ancient dragon.</p><br/><p>It was the same to when she stood on the battlefield of Niflheim. Hraesvelg got a hold of himself at the sharp aura and vitality also entered Vedrfolnir\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy king.\u201d</p><br/><p>Vedrfolnir spoke with a wet voice. It was only a bit but there was joy mixed in her voice.</p><br/><p>There was a long distance to what they had imagined but the current Nidhogg was a good opponent.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg nodded. He clenched his fist and yelled.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, good! Let\u2019s have a duel!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg calmed down himself and released the aura from inside his body. A strong aura surged up like fire just like what happened with Nidhogg.</p><br/><p>The king of the highest branch indeed.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t an easy opponent at all. He was a really strong foe.</p><br/><p>But Cuchulainn shook his head and put an evil smile.</p><br/><p>\u2018He didn\u2019t put a condition for when he won.\u2019</p><br/><p>After Tae Ho listened to the situation about Ratatoskr, he requested Odin to entrust the negotiations to him.</p><br/><p>The reason was simple.</p><br/><p>\u2018I will be able to shake Hraesvelg just by making him duel with Nidhogg.\u2019</p><br/><p>And it turned out like he had thought. Hraesvelg, whose mind and body was a mess, ended up biting the bait Tae Ho had thrown.</p><br/><p>But Tae Ho\u2019s fishing hadn\u2019t ended yet. There was the most important ending left.</p><br/><p>\u201cHraesvelg! I have one more thing to tell you before the duel. I am a summoner at the same time i\u2019m Idun\u2019s warrior. Will I be able to fight with my summons?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo as you wish! It doesn\u2019t matter how many opponents there are!\u201d</p><br/><p>All the conditions had been set. Odin stood up and yelled.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, king of Gods Odin, will be a witness for this duel.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI, Vedrfolnir, will also become a witness for my king.\u201d</p><br/><p>Vedrfolnir spoke confidently and then took the sparrows and flew up high.</p><br/><p>It was to not interfere with the duel.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg\u2019s original body flew to the sky. Hraesvelg, that was still standing on the head of his original body, looked down at Nidhogg and claimed as the king of the highest branch.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome how many you want! I am Hraesvelg, the king of the highest branch!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUooooo!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy king!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOur king!\u201d</p><br/><p>The citizens, that didn\u2019t know of the conversation they had with Nidhogg, cheered. Tae Ho faced at that Hraesvelg with a satisfied face and then turned to look at Nidhogg and Adenmaha.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s start.\u201d</p><br/><p>Odin also left Nidhogg\u2019s head, just like Vedrfolnir did, and then went to Merlin that was waiting in a distant place.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho went to the heart room with Nidhogg.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha and Rolo stood at the sides of Nidhogg.</p><br/><p>\u2018It will be a short warfare. You won\u2019t be able to endure long even if it\u2019s you we are talking about.\u2019</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t talking about the battle against Hraesvelg. It was about what Tae Ho was to do now.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho nodded and sat at the chair in the heart room. He then took out a golden apple he received from Odin and cleared it in one go. The divine power of Idun, that was filling the apple, covered Tae Ho\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>[Saga: Idun\u2019s warrior]</p><br/><p>The amplified power of a God got amplified once again. He embraced Nidhogg, that was hugging him naturally, and then placed his hands on the keyboard and the mouse.</p><br/><p>[Saga: Owner of flames]</p><br/><p>[Saga: Owner of frost]</p><br/><p>Rolo and Adenmaha transformed into Shootingstar and Javier. They were smaller than Nidhogg but they were still huge dragons.</p><br/><p>Three dragons.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg twitched and Vedrfolnir gulped dry saliva.</p><br/><p>But this wasn\u2019t the end. Tae Ho still had one more card.</p><br/><p>[Saga: The warrior that had a Valkyrie meet him]</p><br/><p>The fake Nidhogg appeared. The citizens of the highest branch screamed at the appearance of the dragon that was identical to Nidhogg.</p><br/><p>And one more thing to this.</p><br/><p>The fake Adenmaha that appeared with the \u2018Warrior that had a Valkyrie meet him\u2019.</p><br/><p>[Saga: Owner of frost]</p><br/><p>The fake Adenmaha turned into a fake Javier. It then let out a loud roar.</p><br/><p>Five dragons.</p><br/><p>It was just like Cuchulainn had warned. An overwhelming amount of divine power got spent just by maintaining it. He probably won\u2019t be able to maintain it for too long.</p><br/><p>In addition, it was doubtful if the fake Nidhogg and Adenmaha would be able to move properly. If he couldn\u2019t control them properly, it would only be a waste of divine power.</p><br/><p>\u2018There\u2019s no way you would do something that stupid.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn smirked and said. Tae Ho finished the last preparations instead of nodding.</p><br/><p>[Saga: Legendary pro gamer]</p><br/><p>The screen of the monitor changed. The first person point of view, that was Nidhogg\u2019s point of view, changed into a third person like RTS games.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho would control Nidhogg and give simple orders to Adenmaha and Rolo. He would control the fake Adenmaha and Nidhogg as when you controlled several units from an RTS game.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bad guy. You really are a bastard. Really.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho nodded. He thanked Cuchulainn\u2019s compliment and moved the mouse and the keyboard.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Saga: The one that controls dragons]</p><br/><p>Nidhogg flinched and let out an exclamation. It was the same for Rolo and Adenmaha. They received orders from Tae Ho through the \u2018one that controls dragons\u2019 and \u2018the legendary gamer\u2019.</p><br/><p>The duel started.</p><br/><p>The five dragons flew up towards Hraesvelg.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 41 \u2013 The highest branch (4) &gt; End</p><hr/><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/><p>Episode 41/Chapter 5: The highest branch (5)</p><br/><p>TL: Tsubak</p><br/><p>ED:</p><hr/><br/><p>The reason Tae Ho unleashed all the strength he possessed was simple.</p><br/><p>\u201cHraesvelg is strong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those were Odin\u2019s words. And thanks to Ratatoskr\u2019s testimony being added here, there was no doubt about Hraesvelg\u2019s strength.</p><br/><p>It was too different with Nidhogg.</p><br/><p>The ancient dragon was one of the strongest existences that could bring destruction to the world but it didn\u2019t know how to fight at all. In addition, Nidhogg was submissive and naive so her battle power declined even more. She was at a situation where she should be glad if she knew how to use a tenth of her strength.</p><br/><p>But that wasn\u2019t the same for Hraesvelg.</p><br/><p>He was a protector that had guarded the highest branch for a thousand years. He had plenty of real battle experience and wasn\u2019t the type to dodge battles like Nidhogg.</p><br/><p>The one connected by fate to the black dragon Nidhogg.</p><br/><p>The king of birds Hraesvelg.</p><br/><p>He was strong. He wasn\u2019t saying that he was Nidhogg\u2019s destined enemy for nothing so Tae Ho could only use all of his strength from the start to defeat him.</p><br/><p>\u2018First hit first win. The best thing is to defeat someone before they unleash their real strength.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was Ragnar\u2019s teaching and the experience from when Tae Ho was a pro gamer was telling him the same thing.</p><br/><p>If Hraesvelg got strong when he transformed, then defeat him before he can transform.</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s an opponent that can manifest strong magic, defeat them before they can complete their magic.</p><br/><p>Waiting until the opponent unleashed all of their strength or helping them so they were able to was only a thing that protagonists from fairy tales did.</p><br/><p>\u2018That\u2019s how adults fight.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn said like a joke but his eyes were sharp and cold.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho didn\u2019t let himself get swept by his spirit. He maintained himself calm while five dragons flew towards the sky.</p><br/><p>Just looking at the numbers, it was 5 vs 1 but reality wasn\u2019t that simple.</p><br/><p>First, the difference in size was different.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg was also a really huge creature, although not as big as the 2km long Nidhogg.</p><br/><p>His wings when spread seemed like it passed the hundred meters. Even if eagles were animals which wings were bigger than their bodies, being that big meant that their bodies also reached tens of meters.</p><br/><p>Just looking at the size, the only one that could face Hraesvelg on equal ground was Nidhogg.</p><br/><p>Rolo and Adenmaha also reached tens of meters after they transformed into Shootingstar and Javier but they were still much smaller than Hraesvelg.</p><br/><p>If the length was twice as big, then your body became a few more times that. Rolo and Adenmaha would be seen as children in Hraesvelg\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>And actually, Nidhogg was only comparable to Hraesvelg in size when looking at their bodies. She wasn\u2019t as big as him when you also took the length of the spread wings into account.</p><br/><p>\u2018The more you delay the more disadvantageous it is for you. You have to crush him fast.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho also agreed to that. He glared at Hraesvelg through Nidhogg\u2019s eyes and then looked at the 3rd person screen that showed in the screen. He quickly moved his hands and ordered.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg spread his wings. He fluttered once and the ground shook. The moment he surged up, a strong wind became a wall and covered the heads of the five dragons.</p><br/><p>It was an overwhelmingly strong wind. Tae Ho placed Nidhogg, that was the strongest, at the front and pierced through the wall of wind. Adenmaha and the fake Adenmaha stuck close to her and elevated and Rolo placed the fake Nidhogg in front of it and headed to Hraesvelg\u2019s rear.</p><br/><p>Looking at humanity\u2019s long war record, the strategy in a war served to accomplish one objective.</p><br/><p>Surround and defeat.</p><br/><p>Big numbers would surround a minority and destroy them.</p><br/><p>Even if the total number of the enemy was higher than the allies, they took into account that they were in their local territory where they were bigger in number.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho was loyal to the basics. Nidhogg charged towards Hraesvelg and opened her mouth and Adenmaha and the fake Adenmaha, that easily passed through the wall of wind by sticking close to Nidhogg\u2019s tail, flew sideways and attacked Hraesvelg\u2019s sides.</p><br/><p>The citizens of the highest branch gulped dry saliva and a part of them let out a gasp.</p><br/><p>Right at that moment, a strong poison got fired from Nidhogg\u2019s mouth. It was a strong poison that seemed like it could melt everything it touched and even if the opponent dodges it, they can only get infected.</p><br/><p>But Hraesvelg flew up once again instead of fearing it. A strong wind than the first time got generated to form a whirlwind and scattered the poison Nidhogg spat and a part of them even flew towards Adenmaha and the fake one.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha and the fake Adenmaha hurriedly let out a breath and froze the poison and the wind altogether. Hraesvelg laughed and attacked Nidhogg. There was still the remnant of the poison but he just ignored it. He had no need to fear the remnants, now that it wasn\u2019t even the original attack.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg had prepared a long time for this battle. ALthough the shape was a bit different to what he was expecting, it wasn\u2019t that everything he had prepared had become useless.</p><br/><p>The first time he realized Nidhogg and him were old enemies, he didn\u2019t save time on increasing his resistance towards poison. It was an obvious thing as he would be fighting the black poisonous dragon.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg pierced through the wind mixed with poison and attacked Nidhogg. It was a sharp and fast movement like a mother bird snatching her prey. But Tae Ho moved Nidhogg\u2019s body as if it was his own and dodged Hraesvelg\u2019s attack. He had barely managed to dodge it by twisting Nidhogg\u2019s body so he couldn\u2019t even think about counterattacking. But she wasn\u2019t the only one that was at this place.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha and the fake Adenmaha, that flew on top of Hraesvelg\u2019s head fired an ice breath at the same time.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg snorted and showed a movement normal birds couldn\u2019t even imagine. He started to drop down from the sky and then turned his body at a 180 degree to surge up and hovered on top of the head of Adenmaha and the fake Adenmaha. This attack is what you call a barrel roll.</p><br/><p>The both of them let out a gasp and got bewildered. Nidhogg also expressed perplexion with a really surprised face.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg fluttered his wings strongly. He tried to make Adenmaha and the fake Adenmaha crash by creating a strong wind.</p><br/><p>The two dragons flied desperately and let out screams and Hraesvelg gattered all attention on him.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy king!\u201d</p><br/><p>Vedrfolnir screamed.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg, that was about to attack Nidhogg after sweeping down the two dragons, knew instinctively what Vedrfolnir\u2019s scream meant.</p><br/><p>He turned his head and rolled his eyes. He released his spirit and checked his surroundings.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha, that had pretended to act as if she was crashing, smirked. But it was already too late.</p><br/><p>The fake Nidhogg rushed at Hraesvelg from his rear however Hraesvelg twisted his body and easily dodged the attack. But the fake Nidhogg was also merely a bait. The real attack was something else.</p><br/><p>Rolo fell down from the sky. He was executing a body slam similar to a meteorite, befitting of his name of Shootingstar.</p><br/><p>This attack was hard to dodge even in normal situations. In addition, it was even more so as he had turned to dodge the fake Nidhogg hurriedly.</p><br/><p>But Hraesvelg wasn\u2019t that easy either. He dodged in that situation and evaded a direct hit.</p><br/><p>Rolo hit Hraesvelg\u2019s wing. He barely managed to drop his speed before he crashed in the ground.</p><br/><p>A trajectory of fire got drawn in the sky. Hraesvelg tried to flutter his wings and regain balance but this time, Nidhogg charged towards that Hraesvelg. She opened her mouth widely as if she was trying to bite him instead of firing poison.</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg roared and also opened his beak widely. It was to fire an overwhelming amount of magic power.</p><br/><p>But Nidhogg didn\u2019t stop and Hraesvelg didn\u2019t hesitate and fired out his magic power. He fired away an incredible power that could seal even the movements of Hraesvelg himself!</p><br/><p>[Saga: The warrior that had a Valkyrie meet him]</p><br/><p>Right at that moment, Tae Ho activated his saga. He changed the locations of Nidhogg and the fake one.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg\u2019s magic power hit the head of the fake Nidhogg and broke it down. And right after that Nidhogg, that had moved to the location of the fake Nidhogg, that was at the rear of Hraesvelg attacked him. This time, Hraesvelg had no means to dodge this attack even if it was him.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg bit Hraesvelg\u2019s wing. Half of what she had bit were feathers but there were some fangs that had penetrated Hraesvelg\u2019s skin.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg inserted poison in Hraesvelg\u2019s wings as if she had become a snake. Adenmaha and the fake one didn\u2019t stay still either. They sat on Hraesvelg\u2019s back, now that his movements were sealed, and pushed him to the ground.</p><br/><p>Kwagang!</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg crashed on the ground and a great shockwave swept the surroundings. An explosion shaking the ground got set off and a dust cloud arose to the sky.</p><br/><p>The process became different but the results was as planned. Adenmaha fired an ice breath along with the fake Adenmaha and glued Hraesvelg to the ground. Nidhogg just focused on pressing down Hraesvelg instead of attacking him.</p><br/><p>But even so, Hraesvelg was in good shape. As he put strength in his wings, a crack got formed in the ice made by Adenmaha. Nidhogg\u2019s body moved up and down.</p><br/><p>Rolo fluttered his wings in the air and glared at Hraesvelg. It was to transform into a meteorite once again and attack him.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha and the fake one fired out an ice breath once again. Their task was to restrict Hraesvelg\u2019s movements however they could.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg moved from Hraesvelg\u2019s wings to his body. She spread her arms and legs widely and focused on pressing him down.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg tried to fly once again. The ice broke down and the three dragons shook.</p><br/><p>But he couldn\u2019t fly this time either. Tae Ho gulped dry saliva and handed over the mouse and the keyboard to Nidhogg.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will leave it to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes yes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg nodded with an expression full of joy. She embraced the keyboard and the mouse and then closed her eyes and concentrated. Nidhogg\u2019s body pressed down Hraesvelg once again. It was funny to see as her movements seemed like she was swimming in the ground but the effects were enough. Hraesvelg couldn\u2019t even move.</p><br/><p>The objective of this battle was to make Hraesvelg into their ally. Not to kill him.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg didn\u2019t cover poison in her body just like when she fought against Hrumbak. It was to evade damaging Adenmaha, that was also inflicting damage to Hraesvelg, but there was also another objective.</p><br/><p>The fake Adenmaha disappeared and Rolo descended from the sky to fill that empty spot and stepped on Hraesvelg. The moment he let out a groan filled with rage, the chest of Nidhogg\u2019s body opened with a clicking sound.</p><br/><p>It was Tae Ho. He started to jump in the air the moment he got out of the heart room. He calculated the remaining power of a God he had and headed to Hraesvelg\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg\u2019s essence.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t enter somewhere like Nidhogg\u2019s heart room. He was standing on the head of his original body perhaps to attack the dragon that was stepping on his back himself. It was just like Tae Ho had expected.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg, that was about to attack Adenmaha, noticed Tae Ho approaching him. He grabbed a spear of air he made with magic power and glared at Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>Suppress the essence and end the fight.</p><br/><p>It was the same as with Nidhogg. But Hraesvelg wasn\u2019t Nidhogg. His essence, that had polished his martial arts for a hundred years wasn\u2019t weak at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg roared towards Tae Ho but there was joy in his eyes.</p><br/><p>It was because he was displeased that Tae Ho used many dragons in a duel but he liked Tae Ho\u2019s spirit that got out of Nidhogg and faced him head on.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome! Owner of the black dragon!\u201d</p><br/><p>And perhaps, this was the image of the long waited duel Hraesvelg was waiting for a long time. Hraesvelg remembered his battle against the Great hero a hundred years ago.</p><br/><p>In the other hand Tae Ho felt a sense of incongruity as he charged towards Hraesvelg. And he then realized the reason for it and got perplexed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Scathach\u2019s style techniques?!\u2019</p><br/><p>The stance Hraesvelg was taking was similar to Scathach\u2019s techniques.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn said quickly.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s a subspecies of it. It seems like he only saw it with his eyes and developed it to his own style.\u2019</p><br/><p>Originally, Cuchulainn was usually like the dumb brother of the town, but he was different only in battles. It was a surprisingly fast and precise analysis.</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know how this happened but it rather turned out well. A subspecies won\u2019t be able to beat the real Scathach\u2019s style techniques at all!\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho also agreed. He looked at Hraesvelg with the insight in Scathach\u2019s style techniques, that couldn\u2019t be contained in a subspecies. He also took out his spear to completely suppress Hraesvelg, that was also holding a spear.</p><br/><p>Gae Bolg.</p><br/><p>The spear of death that was like the incarnation of the prince of light Cuchulainn!</p><br/><p>And it was at that moment. Hraesvelg opened his eyes widely and let out a shocked voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cTh, that spear is!\u201d</p><br/><p>He knew it. The shape had gotten a bit different but he had certainly seen it before.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg couldn\u2019t speak as he was really surprised. It was to the point that he couldn\u2019t even breathe properly, although for a brief moment.</p><br/><p>And Tae Ho didn\u2019t let that opening go to waste. He got loyal to Ragnar\u2019s and Cuchulainn\u2019s teachings.</p><br/><p>Strike first, win first.</p><br/><p>He had plenty of time to hear why Hraesvelg got surprised at a later time.</p><br/><p>The attack that was like thunder that started from Tae Ho\u2019s hands extended to Hraesvelg\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 41 \u2013 The highest branch (5) &gt; End</p><hr/><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/><p>Episode 41/Chapter 6: The highest branch (6)</p><br/><p>TL: Tsubak</p><br/><p>ED:</p><hr/><br/><p>The higher your comprehension you had in the sentence of the Milesians, you could unleash a higher skill compared to that.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho had increased the comprehension he had towards almost all weapons significantly in the two years he spent in the tower of shadows.</p><br/><p>Gae Bolg was especially a weapon that needed a high comprehension rate but the reason Tae Ho was able to use it was because he used it frequently but also because he had Cuchulainn\u2019s help.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn transmitted his strength through the sentence of the Milesians. He made Tae Ho\u2019s spearmanship much stronger and quicker.</p><br/><p>Wind walk.</p><br/><p>One of the three stages Scathach\u2019s style techniques had.</p><br/><p>The moment Tae Ho charged forward, he became the wind. No, he became an existence quicker than gale and crossed the air.</p><br/><p>The wind walk wasn\u2019t simply a technique that granted you fast movements.</p><br/><p>It gave you a natural movement like the wind.</p><br/><p>That was why it was hard to catch. Even if you were someone that could catch up to that speed, your reactions became dull by one step in front of the wind walk.</p><br/><p>In addition, Hraesvelg was currently taken aback with something else.</p><br/><p>The moment he realized Tae Ho\u2019s stab, Gae Bolg was already stabbing his chest. The straight attack that was like thunder entered Hraesvelg\u2019s chest regardless of the strength behind it.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhok!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg got pushed back helplessly and vomited blood. It was only this much as he only received the tip of the spear and not the complete blade. If he had been stabbed completely it wouldn\u2019t have ended with this much.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg didn\u2019t groan even at the pain that seemed like his chest turned to dust. He rather opened his eyes widely and glared at Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>Water flow.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho used Scathach\u2019s style techniques instead of attacking Hraesvelg immediately. It seemed like he was just standing in place but Hraesvelg didn\u2019t look at it that way. Tae Ho looked like the water of a flowing river that couldn\u2019t be grabbed by your hands.</p><br/><p>\u2018No way.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg felt his consciousness dim once again. It was unavoidable. He had seen those stances in the past.</p><br/><p>The duel against the great hero he would never forget.</p><br/><p>\u2018So that is the case.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg got sure of it. Idun\u2019s commander was certainly a predecessor of the great hero. His spear and the techniques he used were proof of it.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg laughed. The pain in his chest still remained but his smile didn\u2019t fade away and even let out a strange sound.</p><br/><p>It was a duel he didn\u2019t like.</p><br/><p>It was because the duel he had dreamed for a long time had dissipated pitifully and just accepted the duel half heartedly.</p><br/><p>But it was now different.</p><br/><p>He wanted to fight. He wanted to execute the skills he had polished for a hundred years to the predecessor of the great hero.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh, ahhhhhh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg took a stance naturally. It was a stance that was similar to Water flow.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn opened his eyes sharply and said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Energy is returning to his body. It seems like he has just turned on his engine. So he was a pervert that enjoyed getting hit\u2026..\u2019</p><br/><p>To smile like that after he got hit that much.</p><br/><p>But of course, half of it was a joke. He had cracked that joke to ease Tae Ho\u2019s tension.</p><br/><p>\u2018Just by looking at his aura, he has enough to easily overcome a superior ranked warrior.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg\u2019s essence was strong. His level was different to Nidhogg, that trampled alone while walking.</p><br/><p>\u2018Perhaps, I gave him more time for nothing.\u2019</p><br/><p>The reason Tae Ho didn\u2019t attack right after the attack was because this duel wasn\u2019t meant to take his life.</p><br/><p>\u2018But it doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn smirked and Tae Ho nodded.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg\u2019s aura was certainly strong. Just looking at his stance, he looked like a martial artist that has trained for a long time.</p><br/><p>It was a case that one became strong by polishing himself through countless trainings. He was a skilled warrior that ordinary superior ranked warriors wouldn\u2019t be able to beat.</p><br/><p>But it was like Cuchulainn had said. Tae Ho didn\u2019t feel even a slightest bit of fear.</p><br/><p>A subspecies of Scathach\u2019s style techniques.</p><br/><p>It was Hraesvegl\u2019s martial arts. He was a superior warrior that had developed himself by his own and reached a considerable level.</p><br/><p>But Tae Ho didn\u2019t look at him that way. He could obviously see the secrets behind the technique and know its weaknesses just by looking at it.</p><br/><p>And the reason for that was because Hraesvegl\u2019s martial arts was a subspecies of Scathach\u2019s style techniques.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg\u2019s spear was fast. It was sharp and also strong. But it couldn\u2019t hit Tae Ho. Tae Ho perfectly dodged Hraesvelg\u2019s attack as if he already knew where his spear was going to hit. He rather aimed for the moment Hraesvelg wouldn\u2019t be able to dodge and unleashed a perfect counter attack.</p><br/><p>It was a one sided fight. If you saw it at a glance, it looked like Hraesvelg was pouring down attacks and pushing back Tae Ho but that wasn\u2019t actually the case.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg only hit the air and wasted strength. Each one of his attacks had strength that shook the ground with its after shock but it didn\u2019t matter as they didn\u2019t hit. There were times that his spear clashed against Tae Ho\u2019s but there was no sound that tore the air. It was because Tae Ho swiftly pushed away Hraesvelg\u2019s spear as if water pushed you away.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg increased the speed behind his attacks to increase the number of attacks but it was pointless. The faster and fiercer his attacks became, the more strength and stamina he spent.</p><br/><p>Tak! Tak! Tak!</p><br/><p>The shaft of Gae Bolg hit Hraesvelg\u2019s shoulders, thighs and back of his hand. The attacks perfectly cut off the flow of Hraesvelg\u2019s attacks so his techniques broke consecutively.</p><br/><p>There was joy and despair mixed in Hraesvelg\u2019s face. The duel against the great hero was giving him endless happiness but the fact that he couldn\u2019t even touch the great hero after a hundred years of training made him feel despair.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho calmed his breathing. He dispelled Rolo\u2019s and Adenmaha\u2019s transformation and sent back the fake Adenmaha but he had used too much power of a God. The situation could be turned around if he didn\u2019t end it now.</p><br/><p>Lightning strike.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho, that was on the defensive, turned to the offensive and Hraesvelg\u2019s posture broke with just that.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho pushed back Hraesvelg mercilessly. The blade of Gae Bolg, that was said to contain the power of a curse, was really sharp. Hraesvelg got covered in wounds in an instant and ended up dropping his spear.</p><br/><p>Rock smash.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho unleashed the last attack on Hraesvelg\u2019s thigh. Hraesvelg couldn\u2019t endure it anymore and collapsed.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg looked up at Tae Ho. Gae Bolg was already at his neck.</p><br/><p>\u201cKill me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg closed his eyes and said but Tae Ho put away his spear and shook his head. He contained the words that would work the best to the current Hraesvelg.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are the king of the highest branch. Your life isn\u2019t yours alone so treasure it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The effects of Bragi\u2019s rune was tremendous. Even he thought that it was a cheesy line but he said it really naturally and in a really cool way at that.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn let out a groan as if it was painful but it was different for Hraesvelg. He put a really surprised face and then got moved. He smiled as he didn\u2019t only lose in skills but also in heart and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have lost. It\u2019s your victory.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a fresh smile towards the clean duel, rather than despair about defeat.</p><br/><p>\u2018You are putting that arrogant posture until the end.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho listened to Cuchulainn\u2019s snort and put away Gae Bolg. He extended his hand towards Hraesvelg and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was a nice duel. I have also learned a lot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg would be fighting with them so it was a good thing in the end. In addition, Tae Ho wouldn\u2019t have been able to use that easily if Hraesvelg hadn\u2019t used a subspecies of Scathach\u2019s techniques.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg looked at Tae Ho\u2019s hand with a dumbfounded face for a moment and then smirked again. He put a smile and grabbed his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really do look like a hero. Suitable of being the predecessor of the great hero.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe predecessor\u2026\u2026of the great hero?\u201d</p><br/><p>Actually, Tae Ho was also curious. How was it that Hraesvelg could use a subspecies of Scathach\u2019s techniques? And when did he see Gae Bolg?</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg nodded at Tae Ho\u2019s question. He stood up while staggering a bit because of his thigh and then asked back.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Aren\u2019t you the predecessor of the great hero? You are using his spear and even his martial arts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gae Bolg and Scathach\u2019s style techniques.</p><br/><p>By now, he couldn\u2019t not now who Hraesvelg was referring to. But Tae Ho rather asked with a careful tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026Are you talking about the prince of light Cuchulainn?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPrince of light\u2026That\u2019s right. That person was also called that way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg spoke with a voice filled with emotions and looked at a far away place.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s something that has already passed a hundred years. I have gone down to Asgard in the Great War to test my skills. I met the great hero back then and received a teaching from him.\u201d</p><br/><p>The memory of that time was still clear.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy essence couldn\u2019t defeat the great hero. It ended up in a messy defeat like right now and I couldn\u2019t endure that situation as I faced my first defeat since I was born. I forced him to make him kill me as I have lost. But do you know what he said?\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no way Tae Ho could know. Hraesvelg smirked as he put an expression that he didn\u2019t know well.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe said the same thing as you. To treasure my life as a king. That my body doesn\u2019t only belong to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Indeed, those are cool words suitable to me.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn, that had criticized Tae Ho when he had said it, now spoke with a satisfied face.</p><br/><p>But Tae Ho didn\u2019t care that much. It was because there was something more important than that.</p><br/><p>\u2018Cuchulainn?\u2019</p><br/><p>If he had met with Hraesvelg before, shouldn\u2019t he have told them?</p><br/><p>In addition, it seemed like Hraesvelg deeply respected him. Perhaps, it may have become possible to turn him into an ally without making this much of a fuss.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn snorted at Tae Ho\u2019s urging.</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know, I can\u2019t remember. Do you know how many guys challenged me? I don\u2019t know if it would have been a beauty like Nidhogg. How can I remember an old man?\u2019</p><br/><p>In addition, Cuchulainn was crazy about taking revenge for Scathach and Erin. Actually, Cuchulainn couldn\u2019t even remember the Great War properly by now.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho sighed inwardly and activated Bragi\u2019s rune. He contained words, that had become much cooler than before, to move Hraesvelg\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cHraesvelg, king of birds and owner of the highest branch. The name of this spear is the spear of death Gae Bolg. This is the strongest spear of Erin that has been created by the queen of the land of darkness Scathach and gave it to Cuchulainn, that was her disciple and the the strongest warrior of Erin; the prince of light.</p><br/><p>\u201cOhh..that story\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg got sincerely moved. It was partly because of Bragi\u2019s rune but it was possible because Hraesvelg really admired Cuchulainn.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho paused for a moment to put an expression filled with sorrow and spoke with a tone that was enough to shake Hraesvelg\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe prince of light Cuchulainn\u2026..The great hero has sacrificed himself in the Great War to save countless people. You could say that his end was a really heroical one. If he hadn\u2019t been there, the Great War would have ended with the victory of the giants.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a voice that seemed like he would shed tears as soon as he closed his eyes.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg put a really moved face but Cuchulainn\u2019s reaction was completely different.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hey, what\u2019s wrong with you? Are you hurt somewhere?\u2019</p><br/><p>It was a voice that had bewilderment and embarrassment mixed in it.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho ignored Cuchulainn\u2019s words like he usually did and continued to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Great hero has died like that but he chose to struggle for eternity. Can you see this spear? The great hero has left his soul inside of Gae Bolg in his last moment. It was for the sake of the next generation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOhh. Then in this moment, he\u2019s also\u2026\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. The soul of the great hero resides in this spear.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho raised Gae Bolg high. There was eagerness in Hraesvelg\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe great hero has said. That he clearly remembers you. He says that he\u2019s happy that you look the same although a hundred years have passed. He also says that your skills have increased by leaps and bounds.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Hey, when did I say that huh? You are really scamming here. Is a cheat like saga not enough for you?\u2019</p><br/><p>But Cuchulainn\u2019s yell didn\u2019t reach Tae Ho this time either. Hraesvelg took a breath and trembled because he got moved.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe great hero\u2026\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. He is also admiring that you really look like a king.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHoho, hohoho.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg laughed with an embarrassed face. It seemed like he was trying to contain it but you could clearly see that he didn\u2019t know how to act because of how happy he was.</p><br/><p>\u2018He really likes it. Hey, tell him clearly. Scathach\u2019s style technique is the strongest martial art but that isn\u2019t the case for a mere subspecies. But rather, it\u2019s clear that the subspecies has a limit as it doesn\u2019t contain an essence. It will rather be better for you to learn another martial arts.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cThe great hero says that your talent is really regretful. The teacher of the great hero is currently in Idun\u2019s legion. He wants to introduce you to her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOhh! The teacher of the great hero!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg\u2019s eyes shone and at the same time, Cuchulainn raised his voice.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hey! When did I! Do you think I will leave an old man stick to our master?!\u2019</p><br/><p>It seemed like he would decline but for the reason to be that.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho, that got bewildered, couldn\u2019t ignore Cuchulainn\u2019s words this time. He asked back unconsciously.</p><br/><p>\u2018What about me then?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018You already have an owner! And one that is grabbing you tightly at that!\u2019</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t decline. Because of that, Tae Ho decided to concentrate on Hraesvelg once again instead of discussing with Cuchulainn.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s impossible right now. Valhalla, where the teacher of the great hero resides, is currently being under attack from the giants.\u201d</p><br/><p>A voice filled with sorrow came out once again. It seemed like he had no talent in acting but he was acting perfectly right now maybe because of Bragi\u2019s rune.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg fell completely for Tae Ho\u2019s act and put a serious expression.</p><br/><p>And Tae Ho saw that Hraesvelg was a fish he had almost caught.</p><br/><p>\u201cHraesvelg, owner of the highest branch and king of birds. The great hero needs your strength. Can you accompany us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg nodded slowly at the question that was filled with sincerity. He put a smile suitable of a hero and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the first place, the conditions of the duel was that and I have lost. I have to keep my promise.\u201d</p><br/><p>It had already been decided since he said that he had lost.</p><br/><p>But regardless of that, the reason Tae Ho put effort was to make Hraesvelg sincerely help Asgard.</p><br/><p>And Tae Ho\u2019s plan had worked really well. Hraesvelg claimed in a loud voice to be heard throughout the entire highest branch.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe king of birds Hraesvelg tells you. From now on, the highest branch will lend its strength to Asgard!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was the decision of their king and the citizens of the highest branch had already seen the battle.</p><br/><p>In their eyes, the battle between Tae Ho and Hraesvelg, was a cool duel that had ended by a tiny margin. They could only read the auras as they were really far and Tae Ho had induced it to make it look that way.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a completely messy defeat.</p><br/><p>Their king had faced many enemies confidently and in the end showed a hero cleanly accepting his defeat.</p><br/><p>Because of that, the citizens of the highest branch didn\u2019t oppose to the decision of their king.</p><br/><p>They claimed that they would follow their king.</p><br/><p>It was possible as Hraesvelg was a king that got loved by everyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho requested to shake hands like he could relax a bit. Hraesvelg turned to look at his people after lightly shaking their hands and said with a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cA, also\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease, tell.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg cleared his throat as Tae Ho also spoke with a low voice. He checked his surroundings and spoke quickly as he saw that Vedrfolnir was flying towards them.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026..Will I be able to speak with the great hero at a later time? Not through you but directly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg flushed. His eyes were shining like a kid that couldn\u2019t hide his shyness.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho held back his laughter and spoke seriously.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will try to make a place for the two of you soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t want to, no. I don\u2019t. A shy grandpa. Isn\u2019t it too much? Why is it Nidhogg for you and Hraesvelg for me?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Doesn\u2019t this mean that justice exists in this world?\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn cursed out at Tae Ho\u2019s answer but fortunately, it was only heard by him.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho turned his head. Adenmaha was flying towards them while riding on Rolo and beyond them, Nidhogg was looking at their direction with a nervous face after opening the chest of her body. She was holding a keyboard and a mouse in her embrace.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt ended up well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha said and Tae Ho agreed to it. He made a hand gesture towards Nidhogg, that wanted to come to him.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg smiled brightly at that gesture and Cuchulainn despaired once again at that beautiful and bright smile.</p><br/><p>\u2018This isn\u2019t fair!\u2019</p><br/><p>But it was only heard for him this time too.</p><br/><p>Odin and Vedrfolnir approached them.</p><br/><p>It was the moment Asgard and the highest branch made an alliance.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 41 \u2013 The highest branch (6) &gt; End</p><hr/><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/><p>Episode 41/Chapter 7: The highest branch (7)</p><br/><p>TL: Tsubak</p><br/><p>ED:</p><hr/><br/><p>\u201cI really like Tae Ho master!\u201d</p><br/><p>The first thing Nidhogg did after putting down the keyboard and the mouse was run towards Tae Ho. But there was a swift hand that looked as if someone was snatching the prey. It was Adenmaha.</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you to differentiate the time and place, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha stopped Nidhogg from hugging Tae Ho by grabbing her clothes and said with sharp eyes. The battle had just ended and there was a high probability for them to start speaking about Asgard after Odin and Vedrfolnir arrived.</p><br/><p>And most of all, there was a need to fix her habit that tried to hug Tae Ho wherever she wanted.</p><br/><p>But Nidhogg just blinked at few times at Adenmaha\u2019s scolding and then smiled brightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen at least Adenmaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAt least? You really!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI like your whines. Hey, where did you learn\u2026.Kyak! Where are you touching?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg embraced Adenmaha so she raised her voice and struggled.</p><br/><p>And there was someone that looked that scene with warm eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why is it. Usually, I would be looking at them with a satisfied look but why is it that only tears come out?\u2019</p><br/><p>Fortunately, the only one that could hear Cuchulainn\u2019s dispirited voice was Tae Ho. Hraesvelg, that had no way to know about Cuchulainn\u2019s loss of strength, looked at Nidhogg with a complicated look and then turned to look at Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun\u2019s commander, predecessor of the great hero. Before going into details, may I speak with Nidhogg?\u201d</p><br/><p>Odin and Vedrfolnir were yet to arrive. Tae Ho turned to look at Odin\u2019s side for a moment and nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine if she says so.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I wanted to speak with Hraesvelg for a long time!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg agreed immediately. Adenmaha gave up struggling in her embrace and dropped her shoulders. It was obvious as Nidhogg\u2019s essence was also strong, compared to Adenmaha when she was in her Goddess appearance.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg let out a sigh and fixed his expression. It was an expression suitable of the king of the highest branch.</p><br/><p>\u201cVedrfolnir.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg said in a low voice as soon as Odin and Vedrfolnir arrived. Vedrfolnir understood his meaning just with the look in his eyes and tone and bowed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, my king. I will prepare it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Vedrfolnir started to recite a chant in a low voice. Hraesvelg then spoke to Odin.</p><br/><p>\u201cOdin, I will first take care of this side.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo it. I will wait.\u201d</p><br/><p>The God of magic Odin realized what magic Vedrfolnir was preparing with a glance. Because of that, he agreed to Hraesvelg\u2019s request without even thinking about it. It was because what she was going to do now would be of help and not obstruct them the slightest.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg spoke to Nidhogg once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cNidhogg, Vedrfolnir has the ability to read the memories of the one she touches. May we look at your memories?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg blinked at the polite question and then turned to look at Tae Ho and Adenmaha as if trying to get an answer.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho nodded and Adenmaha whispered in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo it if you want to, and don\u2019t if you don\u2019t want it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The right to choice was on Nidhogg.</p><br/><p>She thought for a moment and then let Adenmaha go from her embrace. She then faced Hraesvelg with a slightly nervous expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine if you read my memories. What do I have to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe only things we will be able to read will be the things that appear on the surface of your consciousness. That\u2019s why you just have to think about Ratatoskr.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand, I will try.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg closed her eyes tight and started to think about Ratatoskr. Then, her eyebrows twitched and put on a depressed expression like she would cry at any moment.</p><br/><p>This side of Nidhogg was still too unfamiliar for Vedrfolnir. She showed bewilderment for a moment and then grabbed Nidhogg\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg approached Vedrfolnir and grabbed her arm. It was to see Nidhogg\u2019s memories with Vedrfolnir as the medium.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t last that long. After about twenty minutes passed, Vedrfolnir opened her eyes with an exhausted look. There was sympathy and pity in her eyes rather than bewilderment.</p><br/><p>And that was also the same for Hraesvelg. He stroke Nidhogg\u2019s head swiftly and said gently.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt must have been hard on you, Nidhogg.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine now. I have Tae Ho master, Cuchulainn oppa, Adenmaha and Odin-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg smiled like a fool. She leaned her head a bit towards Hraesvelg\u2019s big hand as if she didn\u2019t dislike it.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, how good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg stroke her head a few more times and then turned towards Odin. His eyes now had bluntness instead of pity.</p><br/><p>\u201cOdin, I want to take care of Ratatoskr before speaking about the alliance. Can you wait for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>Odin also agreed this time. There was an order to all things, and Odin also thought that they had to take care of Ratatoskr before talking about the alliance.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg\u2019s original body flew up.</p><br/><p>The place he headed to was the outskirts of the highest branch, the place where Ratatoskr was resting.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg\u2019s movements weren\u2019t stealthy at all. The gale generated by the stroke of his wings swept the sky and the ground and was so strong that you could realize that the king of birds was approaching even from far away.</p><br/><p>Ratatoskr curled down and trembled. The groans and screams from Ratatoskr became louder along the sound of the wings that also increased.</p><br/><p>Ratatoskr wanted to flee right now, but its feet didn\u2019t move. It was because Odin had placed several seals before he departed.</p><br/><p>It couldn\u2019t flee even though death was approaching.</p><br/><p>Ratatoskr started to sweat like rain and finally, the king of birds arrived.</p><br/><p>\u201cH, hiiik!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ratatoskr started to breathe roughly and curled down at the huge shadow that covered everything. It couldn\u2019t face the white eagle that was looking down at it.</p><br/><p>But it was impossible to ignore him forever.</p><br/><p>\u201cRatatoskr.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg called it out. Ratatoskr grinded its teeth and then raised its head. It yelled as if cursing.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was wrong! I was wrong! No, it\u2019s not my fault! It\u2019s rather yours!\u201d</p><br/><p>There was fear and rage in Ratatoskr\u2019s face. It glared at Hraesvelg and cried.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou wanted it! You wanted Nidhogg to be an overwhelmingly evil existence! For your long enemy to be a strong existence! That\u2019s why I did it! I just said words you wanted to hear!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis bastard\u2026..!\u201d</p><br/><p>Vedrfolnir got enraged but it was different for Hraesvelg. He didn\u2019t lose his composure until the end. THere wasn\u2019t even a slightest bit of trembling in his eyes when he extended his big hand to restrain Vedrfolnir.</p><br/><p>\u201cRatatoskr. There\u2019s something you are misunderstanding.\u201d</p><br/><p>The calm voice that was heard from the sky made Ratatoskr shut its mouth. Ratatoskr felt a terrible fear at the voice even though it didn\u2019t contain killing intent or rage.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg continued speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true that I hoped for that. It\u2019s true that I wanted my destined enemy to be a strong one and had the rights for me to defeat it. But even so, there\u2019s something that hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d</p><br/><p>The essence of its sin.</p><br/><p>The biggest mistake Ratatoskr made.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that you have toyed with the king of the highest branch for a really long time.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t force him to say that it was a lie.</p><br/><p>What Ratatoskr wanted was real information about Nidhogg, not fake stories that would satisfy his vanity.</p><br/><p>Ratatoskr had gained many things by telling stories about Nidhogg. He enjoyed the wealth and prosperity in the highest branch for a really long time.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd one more thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Displeasement appeared in Hraesvelg\u2019s voice for the first time. And that was something obvious.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg also had a bit of fault as he got tricked by Ratatoskr. He couldn\u2019t completely blame it.</p><br/><p>But what it was different to the thing he would say now.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg, that wanted to resemble the warriors of the temple and the great hero, hated injustice and favored justice. You could say that it was a quality he was born with.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why Hraesvelg got furious. He expressed a greater displeasure than when he got toyed with.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you harass Nidhogg?\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice was cold. It was like a cold fire.</p><br/><p>Ratatoskr couldn\u2019t even breathe properly and this time, it couldn\u2019t even make an excuse.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou had no proper reason to harass her. What did you gain by doing that? Aside from filling up your desire.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had just read a fragment of Nidhogg\u2019s memory but it was terrible and cruel. One could thing that it was merely a childish prank but Hraesvelg didn\u2019t think like that. It was a harass that had continued for a thousand years.</p><br/><p>ABusing and toying the one that only looked at it earnestly.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t forgive it. Hraesvelg released his aura and the entire highest branch shook as if reacting to the rage of its king.</p><br/><p>Ratatoskr let out suffocating sounds. That was the only thing it could do.</p><br/><p>He would die.</p><br/><p>He would really die now.</p><br/><p>Ratatoskr was filled with anger. Just what had he done wrong? Why did it have to die like this!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t kill it!\u201d</p><br/><p>A voice was heard at that time. It was Nidhogg. She hurriedly grabbed Hraesvelg\u2019s arm and pledged while bowing.</p><br/><p>\u201cY, you can\u2019t kill it. No. Save Ratatoskr. I\u2019m begging you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg was crying. It was hard to explain but Ratatoskr was a precious existence for her. It was because Ratatoskr was the only one that had visited her regardless of the situation.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg looked at Nidhogg with regretful eyes and Odin also said.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m also opposed to killing Ratatoskr. It still has its uses.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was also something they had to investigate.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg nodded. He had already known that Nidhogg and Odin would stop him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to tear you to shreds for having toyed with me for a long time but I will leave your execution for now. I will trap you in a prison for now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! No! I don\u2019t want to! Nidhogg! Save me! Help!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ratatoskr\u2019s despair got farther. Nidhogg breathed roughly and Hraesvelg\u2019s big hand got placed in her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cNidhogg.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg raised her head and looked at Hraesvelg. He spoke to the one connected by fate with him in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t change. Rather than thanking you for having saved its life, it would be blaming you instead. Saying that all of this happened because you got out of the roots.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were people that won\u2019t change in the world. It\u2019s nature, that harassed Nidhogg for a thousand years, was like a rotten sewer. It was impossible to make it change.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u2026know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg mumbled with a depressed face. She also knew this fact. That\u2019s why she couldn\u2019t help but cry.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, that\u2019s enough then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg stroke her head a few more times and let out a long sigh. He faced Odin and Tae Ho once again as a king.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe conversation became long. Let\u2019s return now and talk about the alliance.\u201d</p><br/><p>He would keep the promise.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg\u2019s original body flew up once again.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>The talk about the alliance didn\u2019t last that long compared to what they thought. It was because Hraesvelg requested to rest for a moment.</p><br/><p>Taking back Asgard wasn\u2019t an easy thing. Odin gladly accepted that proposal as Niflheim and Midgard also had to cooperate. He used his crows to transmit the news to the two places.</p><br/><p>Because of that, Tae Ho relaxed at the lodging Hraesvelg decided for him. The room that had a high ceiling and had a big terrace was a really fantastic scenery but he couldn\u2019t enjoy it properly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Right, it\u2019s time to rest by now.\u2019</p><br/><p>He had kept running since he left the roots.</p><br/><p>And he finally reached the rest point. He had entered the turning point that was Asgard\u2019s recapture.</p><br/><p>He had spent an overwhelming amount of power of a God against the battle against Hraesvelg and the mental fatigue he had accumulated and had been ignored flowed down all at once so he felt like he would collapse at any moment.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho lied down in the bed that was placed alone in the middle of the room. He took out Heda\u2019s letter instead of falling asleep immediately.</p><br/><p>Idun\u2019s and Heda\u2019s story.</p><br/><p>The letter of the two people that was filled with worry towards him.</p><br/><p>Heda believed that Tae Ho would be alive. She was earnestly craving for it and that was the same for Idun.</p><br/><p>But now, he got able to go to rescue the two of them. There was no need to bury his worry towards them.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hello once again?\u2019</p><br/><p>He felt like he could hear Heda\u2019s voice and the gentle smile of Idun popped up in his head.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg glanced at that Tae Ho from a distance. She sat at the entrance of Tae Ho\u2019s room and mumbled with a depressed face.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeda is too strong. I don\u2019t think I will be able to beat her\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t know if beating was the correct expression but she felt like that. A voice was heard next to her the moment she dropped her shoulders with a teary face.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about Adenmaha?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAdenmaha\u2026..mm, I think I will be able to beat her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause she is easy to deal with?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, she is eas\u2026..no, no. She\u2019s not. Not at all. I will say that she\u2019s not!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg, that had been mumbling unconsciously at herself, stood up and hurriedly denied it. However it was too late. Adenmaha, that sat next to Nidhogg and spoke with a voice to induce an answer from her, spoke with a fierce voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou will? Ugh, you really!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt hurts! Hurts! Hurts!\u201d</p><br/><p>The war between dragons that has resumed once again.</p><br/><p>Usually, Cuchulainn would have already cracked a joke by now but he was silent today. It was because he was thinking about his only master.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho closed his eyes slowly. He then hit his chest twice and said in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Asgard and the nine realms.\u201d</p><br/><p>And for Idun and Heda.</p><br/><p>The morning after four days.</p><br/><p>The black dragon Nidhogg and the king of birds Hraesvelg left the highest branch and headed to Midgard.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 41 \u2013 The highest branch (7) &gt; End</p><hr/><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/>\n</div>"}

There were few cases that she left her sanctum where the golden apple tree was at. It was because Heda woke up in her stead whenever she got out of her sanctum.</p><br/><p>But it was different this time. She didn\u2019t have the leisure to wake up Heda and change bodies. She was just filled with thoughts that she had to run faster.</p><br/><p>Idun was heading to Freya. The Valkyries of Freya\u2019s legion were bewildered at the sudden visit but Idun didn\u2019t make a proper explanation to them, even though they were asking the reason for her visit. She just said that she had to meet Freya and headed to her palace.</p><br/><p>She felt like her chest would burst.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho\u2019s connection was cut off by force. This wasn\u2019t the first time it happened. It was the second time and that\u2019s why she felt all the more anxious.</p><br/><p>The fear she felt when the connection got cut off at the first time was starting to come back.</p><br/><p>\u2018It will be fine. The situation is different from then.\u2019</p><br/><p>Heda said. Idun also knew this. The first time the connection got cut was really the worst.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho was eaten by the World Wolf and the connection got cut. It was a situation where it was logical to think that he was dead.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t believe it later but at first Idun also thought that Tae Ho had died. That\u2019s why she had fallen in a nasty despair.</p><br/><p>Idun forced herself to breathe calmly. Heda spoke once again with the voice she managed to squeeze out.</p><br/><p>\u2018The situation is different. He won this time and he didn\u2019t get eaten either. We also know where he is. The connection between Asgard and Olympus has been severed, that\u2019s all.\u2019</p><br/><p>That was the case. Tae Ho had won against the fake Achilles and didn\u2019t get sent to another place.</p><br/><p>But they couldn\u2019t feel relieved.</p><br/><p>Why did the connection get severed?</p><br/><p>Why did the fake Achilles attack Tae Ho and the Valkyries?</p><br/><p>They felt an uneasy feeling and the cause for that was in the strong divine power that closed down the path.</p><br/><p>Idun could sense who it belonged to. She wanted to deny the truth but she couldn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>Why? For what!</p><br/><p>\u201cFreya-nim has said that she will meet you immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>A Valkyrie of Freya\u2019s legion said. It was a Valkyrie she knew the face of. Hrist. It was the Valkyrie that had the highest rank among the ones serving Freya.</p><br/><p>Idun calmed her troubled face and took a deep breath once again. She calmed down herself but couldn\u2019t stop the tears from flowing down.</p><br/><p>Only ten days had passed. It hadn\u2019t even been fifteen days.</p><br/><p>The fierce battle that occurred in Valhalla.</p><br/><p>The battle he put his life at stake by facing the Magician King and the World Wolf.</p><br/><p>It was too short. The time Tae Ho could relax and rest and the time they could spend together.</p><br/><p>Compared to Heda and Freya who thought that Idun was one independent Goddess, Idun thought that she was Heda\u2019s assistant. Because of that, she had always suppressed her emotions by standing behind.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why she felt more pained than Heda. She couldn\u2019t endure the burst of emotions.</p><br/><p>Idun clenched her chest and gulped down the grief and at that moment the door to Freya\u2019s room opened.</p><br/><p>Freya showed herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun.\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya called for her. She looked at her messy face and embraced her instead of asking what had happened.</p><br/><p>It was warm. That\u2019s why she couldn\u2019t suppress her emotions anymore.</p><br/><p>Idun burst in tears. She explained what had happened to Tae Ho while crying.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>\u201cI will introduce myself once again. My name is Patroclus. I\u2019m the lion of Athena-nim that received an order to notify Asgard of the danger Olympus is facing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rasgrid held her breath for a moment at Patroclus\u2019 introduction and glanced at Tae Ho. Tae Ho nodded and asked as everyone\u2019s representative.</p><br/><p>\u201cPatroclus, can you tell us what happened in Olympus? And also about why the great hero of Olympus Achilles attacked us.\u201d</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t seen wrong. The one that had attacked the Valkyries and the warriors of Valhalla suddenly was Achilles and the warriors that had appeared to assist him were the Myrmidons.</p><br/><p>Patroclus nodded instead of making an excuse. He spoke with a calm voice once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will tell you everything one by one. First, the one that attacked us was really my best friend Achilles. Precisely speaking, it\u2019s a copy of mine that was created by Pygmalion and is controlled by Achilles\u2026.you can say that it\u2019s a kind of puppet. I have an ability to borrow Achilles\u2019 appearance and strength for a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was the reason Achilles had the name of Patroclus prototype.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho frowned at Patroclus\u2019 explanation. It was because there may be more fake Achilles\u2019s that had the strength of a superior ranked warrior but also because he heard a familiar name.</p><br/><p>\u2018What? Is there something weird?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018No, it\u2019s fine.\u2019</p><br/><p>Pygmalion.</p><br/><p>The sculptor that loved the sculpture he made too much.</p><br/><p>The story that Aphrodite gave life to the sculpture because she was moved by his devoted love was a really famous story.</p><br/><p>\u2018It was one of the few happy endings in Greek mythology.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho himself also liked this story but the story wasn\u2019t the important thing now. In addition, there was a high probability the Pygmalion Tae Ho knew of was different to the real one just like the several characters of Erin and Asgard.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho concentrated on Patroclus once again and he opened his mouth right in time.</p><br/><p>\u201cAchilles had originally come to stop me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you saying to stop you from transmitting the news to Asgard?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. In that time, I encountered your troop of warriors and battle occurred. Achilles would have wanted to hide that he had infiltrated Asgard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Patroclus answered Rasgrid\u2019s words and paused for a moment. Rasgrid felt regret at his depressed look but they weren\u2019t in a situation to wait and understand everything.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you came to this place. To trick Achilles\u2019 eyes for a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust like you said. Achilles will think that I headed to Asgard\u2026..so I thought that he won\u2019t find me for some time if I headed to Olympus.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have been a nuisance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rasgrid bowed. The reason Patroclus revealed himself was to rescue Rasgrid.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, how could I leave you behind when you were dying? Also, in an aspect all of this is Olympus\u2019 fault. It\u2019s not your fault at all. In addition, I would have been discovered immediately even if I didn\u2019t rescue you and kept going.\u201d</p><br/><p>Patroclus shook his hands. There was a deep anxiety and guilt in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cPatroclus, did an internal problem occur in Olympus?\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha asked in a low voice. Patroclus closed his eyes tightly and answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s not the Gigantomakhia but an internal problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gandur and Ingrid kept silent. They had already expected this answer but they felt gloomy when they heard it for real.</p><br/><p>But this wasn\u2019t all.</p><br/><p>Rasgrid forced herself to talk and mentioned one fact she couldn\u2019t say it out loud.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe divine power that closed the path\u2026.Does it really belong to that person? That person\u2026..Asgard\u2019s\u2026..no, did they become enemies of the ones wanting to maintain the world?\u201d</p><br/><p>Her voice trembled. It was unavoidable.</p><br/><p>Because the divine power that closed the path belonged to that person.</p><br/><p>The absolute being that was above all the other Gods.</p><br/><p>The king of Gods that was stronger than the other 12 Gods together.</p><br/><p>Zeus.</p><br/><p>It was him. The divine power belonged to him. You could only experience his divine power if you visited Olympus at least once as it remained in several parts of Olympus.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not only him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Patroclus said. He was rather calm. But that\u2019s why his despair showed even more. Even Nidhogg who didn\u2019t know the God that was mentioned put on a scared face and embraced Adenmaha.</p><br/><p>\u201cMost of the 12 Gods including Zeus have become existences that wish for the destruction of their world. They ended up becoming our enemies.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rasgrid closed her eyes and Gandur cursed out.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about the others?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ingrid barely managed to ask. It was important to know why they had suddenly changed sides but what they needed most to grasp the situation was the number of Gods that had turned their backs.</p><br/><p>Patroclus answered with a dark expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe certain thing is Athena-nim and the queen of Gods Hera-nim, that have sent me. I don\u2019t know about the others precisely.\u201d</p><br/><p>Merely 2 among 12.</p><br/><p>Patroclus had used the expression \u2018most of them\u2019. They would still have to listen to the story a bit more but it was certain that more than half of them had turned their backs.</p><br/><p>And what that meant.</p><br/><p>The meaning that had having Zeus and the others turn into ones wanting to destroy the world.</p><br/><p>\u201cA war between Asgard and Olympus.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho said.</p><br/><p>Patroclus nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that far. It will begin on the day Zeus takes control over all of Olympus.\u201d</p><br/><p>A war between a world and another one.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho closed his eyes. He thought of Idun\u2019s and Heda\u2019s face which he saw before the connection got severed.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 49 \u2013 The Goddess of warfare Athena (1) &gt; End</p><hr/><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It was the name given by the ones that came to visit this forest, to the strongest one that led the strongest gryphon pride for 4 years.</p><br/><p>Rolo.</p><br/><p>Rolo was in a really enraged state. Actually, he was in a really good mood a few minutes ago. Because he had smelled the blood of horses. he saw the three female gryphons, that were the strongest even inside the pride, fly up and imagine the horse meat he would soon eat.</p><br/><p>It was hard to wait because he hadn\u2019t eaten horse meat for a long time. Although he remained calm because he couldn\u2019t show an unsightly look to the remaining females, what he wanted was to go hunting with them.</p><br/><p>When would they return? They wouldn\u2019t be eating among themselves, right?</p><br/><p>While he was thinking of such things he heard a cry. It was a rescuing request from a female. This sound was surprising enough, but the sound it heard next shocked him even more. A female of the pride was showing its cute side to someone else!</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t forgive it. If it was a new male, then he would peak its eyes with his beak. There was no way that the horse, that was merely food, threatened them.</p><br/><p>Rolo flew quickly. After fluttering his strong wings, he saw a shocking scene. One of the females was collapsed on the ground, and another one was crying as if it didn\u2019t know what to do. And the last one, the female he treasured the most was letting an unknown guy ride on her.</p><br/><p>Rolo roared. His cry filled with rage shook the ground and sky. The female that requested help cheered as if telling him to come quickly.</p><br/><p>However, Rolo wasn\u2019t satisfied. It wasn\u2019t because it was afraid of the human riding on the female. The female was putting a relaxed expression and the one above her was smiling.</p><br/><p>He would take him in an instant. After throwing him to the ground he would crush his head and chest with his beak.</p><br/><p>Rolo charged towards the human like a thunder. However, he could only turn his direction before snatching him. It was because the human riding on the female jumped up.</p><br/><p>The human couldn\u2019t fly. So he could snatch him when he landed but this human was a bit different. He made a turn on the air and then transformed into a hawk and charged into him.</p><br/><p>He was bewildered but Rolo rather felt pleased. Because a big hawk was more delicious than a human. In addition, it seemed like more places to eat has been added.</p><br/><p>He was planning to teach the arrogant hawk that was attacking him, the head of the pride and the ruler of the forest, what an aerial attack was. However, it seemed like the hawk didn\u2019t have any thoughts of fighting that the moment it was about to exchange blows with Rolo it twisted its body sideways as if running away.</p><br/><p>Rolo wasn\u2019t disappointed. Because making quick turns and chasing was Rolo\u2019s specialty. If he fled in that state, then it would be better for him because he would be able to catch up.</p><br/><p>But another disaster occurred. The hawk transformed into a human again instead of flying past him. Even before Rolo could do something the human got on his back.</p><br/><p>Rolo roared again. He shook his body trying to make the human fall and tried to fly fast.</p><br/><p>However, the human was a bit faster. The moment he was about to flutter his wings the hands of the human got placed in his back, and Rolo fell in a weird feeling.</p><br/><p>\u2018My, my strength is getting drained.\u2019</p><br/><p>His body didn\u2019t move as he wished. It didn\u2019t stop there that his rage had weirdly subsided. Although it had certainly tried to fly fiercely, he was soon flying softly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Thi, this isn\u2019t it. I can\u2019t be like this.\u2019</p><br/><p>His consciousness faded more and more. He just didn\u2019t want to think about anything. However, Rolo tried his best to get ahold of himself. He remembered the rage burning in his chest.</p><br/><p>\u2018Wake up! You are waking up Rolo!\u2019</p><br/><p>It was when he was telling himself to wake up.</p><br/><p>A rope got laced in his neck. He was sure it was the arrogant human. But the moment it got tied in his neck he started to think of the human as the human master.</p><br/><p>\u2018My, my strength is draining again\u2026..\u2019</p><br/><p>His will to resist disappeared. And the cry of the bewildered female couldn\u2019t make him feel anything</p><br/><p>[Saga: The one that handles dragons]</p><br/><p>[Strengthened hunter\u2019s rope]</p><br/><p>[The feeling to resist disappeared]</p><br/><p>[Alpha male: Rolo]</p><br/><p>The moment the red letters turned green, Tae Ho let out a sigh of relief. He maintained \u2018the one that handles dragon\u2019s that he had executed with all his strength and then took out the Beast\u2019s saddle from Unnir.</p><br/><p>As the Alpha male was flying too smoothly, it was also easy to place the saddle on it. When the saddle transformed into a suitable size, Tae Ho found it easier to control it.</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho!\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda\u2019s voice was heard from below. As he turned around while smiling in a good mood, he saw that she was waving towards him. Siri was still vigilant of the remaining gryphon but her eyes were smiling.</p><br/><p>\u201cI got him!\u201d</p><br/><p>His strength was good just like its size. Although its physical capabilities weren\u2019t as good as Siri that had transformed through the dragon wing coat his flight ability would be a level above hers.</p><br/><p>\u2018In addition, it\u2019s cool.\u2019</p><br/><p>It had the same eyes as a bald eagle. Even though it was calm because of \u2018the one that handles dragons\u2019 and the hunter\u2019s rope, its eyes were still sharp.</p><br/><p>\u201cI just have to get reins and armor for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The three set in Dark Age were the reins, armor, and saddle. Although it was vague for the armor, if you had the reins it would become easier to control it.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho looked at the direction Rolo came flying from. Because of \u2018the one that handles dragon\u2019s he could read Rolo\u2019s thoughts a bit. It seemed like there were some female gryphons remaining in this nest.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s go down for now.\u2019</p><br/><p>It seemed like the first gryphon he had caught was released from the effects of \u2018the one that handles dragons\u2019 that was looking at them with bewildered eyes. He thought that he should capture Rolo and then capture the remaining female gryphons or not.</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho!\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda\u2019s voice was heard again. But it was different to before. Tae Ho got surprised at her yell that was close to a shout and turned to look at Heda hurriedly. Heda and even Siri and Ragnar were looking at the same direction. It wasn\u2019t at Tae Ho but behind him.</p><br/><p>Popong!</p><br/><p>The sound was heard late, just like what happened with thunders. A signal beam exploded from a far place. It was a red signal signaling an emergency.</p><br/><p>In addition, it wasn\u2019t only one. One more signal beam surged up from another place. It was also red this time.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho hurriedly turned Rolo and went to the ground. As soon as they landed Ragnar approached and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an emergency signal. Looking that they set off at the same time, the troops that were searching the surroundings must have been attacked.\u201d</p><br/><p>It has already been a few days since Valhalla became aware of Garmr\u2019s soul fragment. It was obvious for them to search a wide radius from the remaining traces of the Great War.</p><br/><p>This place also belonged to a far place of Asgard. The closest post two days in a carriage to reach. The only ones that could help them right now were Tae Ho\u2019s group.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are splitting the group in two.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the first place, as it was merely searching a wide area, only lowest ranked warriors and some inferior ranked warriors would have been dispatched. Although there may be an intermediate ranked warrior among them, even if that was the case Tae Ho\u2019s group would still be of help.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho nodded at the word of splitting their group. Because it was also the most effective method for him.</p><br/><p>Ragnar got on top of Rolo. Heda transformed into a big and beautiful swan and made Siri ride her.</p><br/><p>It was proper for Ragnar and Heda to go to different places. That\u2019s why Tae Ho, that became able to fly because of the gryphon went with Ragnar that couldn\u2019t fly and Siri getting on Heda was also a natural thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda left those words while looking at them and flew up. Siri was grabbing onto Heda\u2019s neck and said something towards them really quickly. It seemed like she was wishing them to be safe like Heda.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar grabbed Tae Ho\u2019s waist. His arms were as strong as steel.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho felt a strange feeling and urged Rolo. Rolo flew up with its big wings.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>The traces of the Great War weren\u2019t only present in Svartalfheim but were scattered in places where Asgard was in control of, just like Asgard, Midgard, and Vanaheim.</p><br/><p>After passing through the mountains that were connected with the vast forest, a plain land appeared as if the scene he had seen until now was a lie. This landscape was the aftermath left by the Great War.</p><br/><p>A signal beam exploded from a really far place. It was obvious that if it wasn\u2019t a warrior of Valhalla with quite a lot of accumulated runes, they wouldn\u2019t even have been able to recognize it properly.</p><br/><p>Because of that, Tae Ho felt anxious even though he was already flying at a fast speed. He didn\u2019t know who was in danger, but his heart was moved by the fact that it was fired by the warriors of Valhalla.</p><br/><p>Perhaps it may be because he had seen the warriors in the trace of Great War in Svartalfheim.</p><br/><p>The warriors of Valhalla that were prideful. Tae Ho had already become one of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cOver there!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar yelled. A battle was occuring on the ground. Tens of warriors were fighting against a big monster, and you could even see three giants that were 7 meters tall at the center.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will take the giants. You take the sky.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar spoke quickly and then loosened his arms that were holding onto his waist. Then he jumped down the moment Rolo passed over the battlefield.</p><br/><p>Although it was tens of meters high, it wasn\u2019t that big of a problem for Ragnar that had once been a top ranked warrior. Ragnar\u2019s body, that was falling down, started to emanate white light and that sight was beautiful to behold.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho looked below his feet instead of still looking at Ragnar. The reason Ragnar entrusted Tae Ho the sky was because the enemies weren\u2019t only in the ground.</p><br/><p>Now, there weren\u2019t only the harpies he was accustomed to, but there were also wyvern riders which he hadn\u2019t seen since Black Fortress attacking the warriors of Valhalla. Defeating them was Tae Ho\u2019s role.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go Rolo!\u201d</p><br/><p>If you got a new car you have to step on the pedal!</p><br/><p>Although they hadn\u2019t known for long, Rolo elevated Tae Ho from being a human to human-nim, was faithful to his orders. When he spread his big wings and let out a roar, all the harpies and wyverns turned to look at them.</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun\u2019s warrior!\u201d</p><br/><p>The voices of the warriors burst out. Although Tae Ho couldn\u2019t distinguish them one by one, there were many familiar voices.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho created a strong wind through the \u2018charge of the warrior\u2019 and looked at the ground after passing by the harpies. He could see a familiar troop flag and familiar faces.</p><br/><p>\u2018Thor\u2019s legion!\u2019</p><br/><p>They were the lowest ranked warriors that had taken part in the expedition of Black Fortress with him. And there was also an inferior ranked warrior among them.</p><br/><p>\u201cBracky!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUoooooo!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bracky roared as if answering to Tae Ho\u2019s call. He, who was facing one of the giants, had small blue sparks around his body and was also bigger than the last time he saw him.</p><br/><p>[Saga: He\u2019s the son of a God]</p><br/><p>He was a warrior so outstanding he was called as Thor\u2019s son in Midgard. Just like Tae Ho\u2019s saga had evolved, his saga had also done the same.</p><br/><p>Even though he was facing against three giants, he could know the reason Thor\u2019s legion didn\u2019t break down easily. It was because of he, who wasn\u2019t excessive to call him as a little giant, was there.</p><br/><p>Babang!</p><br/><p>Thunder fell down in that instant. Everyone covered their ears at the loud sound shaking the entire battlefield and turned their eyes. It was Ragnar. He fell down from the sky like a God and landed on the ground with a loud sound. The moment his sword that was covered with white light touched the ground, one of the giants collapsed. It was completely split from its shoulder to its groin.</p><br/><p>It was a really superhuman scene. In addition, it didn\u2019t stop there. Ragnar raised his sword and yelled.</p><br/><p>\u201cRagnar Lodbrok orders you! Warriors of Valhalla! Fight!\u201d</p><br/><p>His shout covered the battlefield. And his yell woke up the warriors. It gave courage to the warriors and gave them strength.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho admired.</p><br/><p>Ragnar\u2019s shout wasn\u2019t a saga. It was really just a shout. However, this was the results of Ragnar Lodbrok\u2019s strong charisma.</p><br/><p>\u201cRagnar!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRagnar Lodbrok!\u201d</p><br/><p>The warriors of Valhalla chered. Just like what happened in Ullr\u2019s legion, they also started to call his name.</p><br/><p>Did you see?</p><br/><p>Ragnar glanced at him. Tae Ho just smirked at his smile that seemed like telling him that he was this amazing and then he turned his head.</p><br/><p>They were still in the middle of fighting. They could listen to the stories after the fight.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go first.\u201d</p><br/><p>He could do more things as he had obtained a gryphon. Lance Charging wasn\u2019t the only thing Tae Ho could do. The only thing that had advanced wasn\u2019t only the \u2018sword of the warrior;</p><br/><p>[Saga: The charge of the warrior is like a storm]</p><br/><p>Until now, the only wind was added to it. However, it was different now.</p><br/><p>Because the storm that swept up the battlefield in the election of the national representatives wasn\u2019t a normal one.</p><br/><p>A sparking sound was heard at the wings of Rolo, that was gliding through the wind. The small sparks got connected and then mixed in with the wind.</p><br/><p>And then, the thing that was made. The thing that occurred.</p><br/><p>\u201cThunderstorm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho mumbled. He reproduced the battle of that day along with Rolo.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 16 \u2013 Legend (1) &gt; End</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/valhalla-saga-chapter-48\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 48\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/valhalla-saga-chapter-50\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 50\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"95317\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

She extended her arms and put on a warm smile filled with affection. Although he couldn\u2019t see her face well because of the light he could still know that. No, he could feel it.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy warrior Tae Ho. It\u2019s really nice to see you healthy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Idun, that spoke gently, let out a sigh of relief and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard about the battle from Adenmaha. And saw it myself from the middle.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou saw it yourself?\u201d</p><br/><p>Idun nodded as Tae Ho asked back unconsciously.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, Tae Ho. It\u2019s because of that marvelous strength you used. Didn\u2019t you also hear my voice?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mythology ranked saga, Idun\u2019s warrior.</p><br/><p>He felt like he could know. The voice he heard in the middle of the battle wasn\u2019t a hallucination.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I heard. I also felt your power.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, I also felt you Tae Ho.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was beyond simply transmitting power. The abundant power of a God made that possible.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre Adenmaha and Rolo okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho asked hurriedly as if he just remembered. He was worried about Adenmaha that returned completely exhausted but was also worried about Rolo that had returned while being completely petrified. Adenmaha was a strong sea serpent and a Goddess of Tuatha De Danann but Rolo was just a gryphon.</p><br/><p>But of course, he wasn\u2019t an ordinary one. It had a head so good to the point it made you think that it was an intellectual animal and also had a physical body that far surpassed the normal gryphons. But still, he couldn\u2019t help but be worried.</p><br/><p>Idun slightly dropped his shoulders at Tae Ho\u2019s question and said softly as if telling him to calm down.</p><br/><p>\u201cAdenmaha was so exhausted she would need to rest for a few days. But don\u2019t worry as she isn\u2019t greatly hurt. Rolo also suffered a bit of injury from the fall.\u201d</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t seem like she was lying to comfort him. Tae Ho then dropped his shoulders as if relaxing.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, it is. Also\u2026.Adenmaha is a really nice girl. She worried about you a lot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a good guy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although she snorted or acted spoiled in front of him, she still did her best for Tae Ho at all times.</p><br/><p>\u2018I feel sorry for her.\u2019</p><br/><p>He had treated her too roughly recently. He thought about giving her a small gift and thanking words the next time he met her.</p><br/><p>While Tae Ho was still thinking about Adenmaha, Idun just looked at him without saying anything. Her eyes were filled with affection and worry.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy warrior Tae Ho. I saw the strength you showed in the battle. It was a new strength created by\u2026\u2026combining the strength of Asgard and Erin. Ragnar was also impressed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Idun caressed Tae Ho\u2019s cheeks and said. Tae Ho got bewildered at her suddenly touching his cheek but then concentrated on her words.</p><br/><p>\u201cRagnar did?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I was also surprised.\u201d</p><br/><p>The geass Tae Ho had used was close to pushing it. No one from Erin used a geass like Tae Ho did. No, in the first place they couldn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>The reason it worked for him was simple.</p><br/><p>Because the myth rank saga \u2018Idun\u2019s warrior\u2019 was a combination of his saga and the geass. It was the result of combining two strengths.</p><br/><p>\u2018Perhaps it may be because Tae Ho didn\u2019t belong to Asgard nor Erin.\u2019</p><br/><p>Those were the words Ragnar said after hearing about \u2018Idun\u2019s warrior\u2019. And Idun also thought that to be the case.</p><br/><p>He was able to handle the two strengths harmoniously as he didn\u2019t belong to neither side. And they had a special spot just like Ragnar had said previously.</p><br/><p>The reason why Tae Ho came to Valhalla wasn\u2019t simply coincidence but may have another reason behind it. His fate may be connected with the thread of fate made by the three sisters.</p><br/><p>Idun shook her head. It wasn\u2019t that she denied the thought she had. Because whether it was fate or coincidence that he entered Idun\u2019s legion, he was still led to it. Tae Ho was the most precious warrior of Idun.</p><br/><p>Idun organized her thoughts by taking a breath and spoke to Tae Ho again.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was certainly a surprising power. But the price it comes with is also big. Later on Cuchulainn or Ragnar will tell you in more detail, but it will be better not to use it that frequently.\u201d</p><br/><p>The restriction of Tae Ho\u2019s geass was limited. Using a normal geass as an example it was secured that you would get punished after breaking your pledge. So although it had gotten outside the grasp of being a normal geass, there was no way it would only function well.</p><br/><p>In addition, the price of not being able to use the power of a God for fifteen days wasn\u2019t light.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho was a warrior. That meant that he was someone that had to fight and would get deployed to the battlefield at any time. Decreasing their forces by fifteen days wasn\u2019t something they could do easily.</p><br/><p>But of course, as the price is high the effects he could obtain through \u2018Idun\u2019s warrior\u2019 was also big.</p><br/><p>He could defeat a strong opponent because he used \u2018Idun\u2019s warrior\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u2018Idun\u2019s warrior\u2019 was a two edged sword. And the performance of these kinds of weapons changed depending on the user.</p><br/><p>Adequate techniques at adequate times.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho remembered a phrase he used to hear when he was a pro gamer and nodded heavily.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I will take it into account.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, I believe in you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Idun took off her hands from Tae Ho\u2019s cheeks and then continued speaking with a worried tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cI investigated about the Tyrant Bress. He\u2019s a really stubborn guy. It would seem like he won\u2019t show himself but\u2026.There\u2019s a possibility he may keep attacking you.\u201d</p><br/><p>In Bress\u2019s position, he had worked for nothing twice. In addition, the resentment and rage Bress felt towards Tae Ho was bigger than he thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be easy for a giant of Jotunheim to appear like before. Ragnar said that Bress must have spent quite a big force for this so he won\u2019t launch an attack immediately. Also\u2026.Valhalla won\u2019t also stay still. As Bress is also a big enemy of Asgard, we are planning to track him down in this opportunity.</p><br/><p>Bress showed the tail he was hiding to attack Tae Ho. In addition, Midgard was a special land for Asgard. You wouldn\u2019t know if he had acted in Svartalfheim but as fomoires had appeared in the middle of Midgard, Asgard wouldn\u2019t forgive his actions.</p><br/><p>Even if they couldn\u2019t find Bress immediately it would still have some effect. Because he would be hiding all the time. He wouldn\u2019t even have the courage to touch Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly\u2026. there\u2019s a high probability for the giants to show interest in Midgard because of what happened. That\u2019s why reinforcements will be sent from Valhalla.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReinforcements?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, as we can\u2019t send a big army to Midgard we decided to send an additional Valkyrie and some veteran warriors. You will be able to meet them in about two days.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed like not even Idun knew exactly who they were going to be that she didn\u2019t give names.</p><br/><p>\u2018It isn\u2019t Heda.\u2019</p><br/><p>Then will it be Rasgrid or Reginleif? Or Gandur.</p><br/><p>Or perhaps a completely new Valkyrie.</p><br/><p>When Tae Ho was concentrating on the Valkyries rather than the warriors, Idun put on a gentle smile and changed subjects to bring out a joyous story.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy warrior Tae Ho, you have been working hard in Midgard. My influence in the mortal world has multiplied by a few times.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlready?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho asked back reflexively. He was working hard but it hadn\u2019t even been ten days.</p><br/><p>Even if the reaction was fast, it was too fast.</p><br/><p>Idun flinched at Tae Ho\u2019s question and then checked her surroundings and approached Tae Ho. She said in a low voice as if whispering him.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm\u2026.It\u2019s embarrassing to say this but I will tell you just because it\u2019s you. In the first place, my influence is too small so it\u2019s easy to notice it even if it increases by a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho still couldn\u2019t see properly because of the light but he was certain. Idun\u2019s cheeks and ears were red of embarrassment. He didn\u2019t know if he could say this to a Goddess but her uneasy side was just too cute.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will work harder.\u201d</p><br/><p>Idun put on a complicated smile when Tae Ho spoke but then nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you. But still you should rest at times. I\u2019m worried about what kind of reward I should give you if you raise that many achievements. Do you know how long I have been thinking before you came here? But of course, it was a really fun thinking.\u201d</p><br/><p>The mounting set was already coming to an end too.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho smirked at her mumbling that seemed to be a complaint and then expressed his manners a bit more excessively.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will receive it with a happy heart regardless of what it is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more burdensome if you speak like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI believe that you will pick it well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Idun giggled at Tae Ho\u2019s answer and then put on a serious expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Tae Ho, my warrior, I realized something when watching your fight directly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI point you realized?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, you called Heda\u2019s name a lot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>He did do that a lot. Because he got strength whenever he called out her name.</p><br/><p>As Tae Ho dodged her eyes and dimmed her words Idun opened her eyes sharply and then spoke while imitating Heda.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you really did, my warrior Tae Ho doesn\u2019t call my name but calls Heda\u2019s name when he\u2019s in danger to gain strength. So that was the reason.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cId, Idun-nim?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m joking. A joke.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut your eyes are scary.\u201d</p><br/><p>Idun just smiled evilly at Tae Ho pointing that out and then crossed her arms and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t actually care but Heda was really satisfied. That\u2019s enough. Isn\u2019t that like that for you too? Am I wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Just what answer did he have to give right now?</p><br/><p>But fortunately Idun didn\u2019t tease him too much.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really a joke so don\u2019t worry. Whoever you call, it\u2019s enough for me if that gives you strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>The important thing was that Tae Ho had returned safely.</p><br/><p>Idun spoke with a gentle voice and then changed subjects.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou absorbed quite a lot of attribute runes this time. Ragnar said that you should expect for his classes as he would start a new lesson.\u201d</p><br/><p>The amount of attribute runes Tae Ho had gathered until now amounted to thirty.</p><br/><p>The conditions to become a superior ranked warrior wasn\u2019t only the mythology ranked saga so it was now time to start an earnest class about attributes.</p><br/><p>As Tae Ho nodded Idun raised her head to look at the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy precious warrior Tae Ho, it\u2019s unfortunate but it seems like it\u2019s already time to return.\u201d</p><br/><p>Happy times always passed quickly.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho hit his chest lightly and lowered his posture to express his etiquette and Idun placed her lips on his forehead and blessed him.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet my blessing accompany you.\u201d</p><br/><p>A faint and warm golden light covered Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>Tae Ho opened his eyes in a good mood. It seemed like it was thanks to Idun\u2019s blessing that his body felt refreshed just like when you just took a bath.</p><br/><p>\u2018You woke up? It\u2019s already at the sunset Princess Helga came four times to see if you were awake.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn said immediately. When he looked outside the window the sun was really setting. It seemed like he had slept for quite a long time after the meeting had ended.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho thought about Helga for a moment. She, that was the princess of Kataron, was a beauty and in addition held a really good will towards Idun. Because of that she was the strongest candidate to become the most important existence in creating the national religion in Kataron.</p><br/><p>\u2018It seems like the latter is more important than the former.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cEy, how can that be? Before that, why did she come?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know exactly but it seems like its because of the banquet. Because the warriors of Valhalla that were supposed to be stars were all injured so they couldn\u2019t celebrate victory properly. She would propably speak about the plague and how they got rid of it at the celebratory banquet.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was an understandable reasoning. Actually, excluding Bracky, that had completely recovered through the effects of his saga, and Harabal that only suffered minor injuries all the other warriors were lying on the bed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs captain Siri fine\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t worry. She already came once when you were sleeping. Although she did seem a bit dispirited it seems like she\u2019s fine. She rather looked prettier than normal.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho thought of another thing instead of asking how being safe and having become prettier was related.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is it the effects of a new saga?\u2019</p><br/><p>Siri\u2019s new saga that even made the enemy turn to look at her.</p><br/><p>Bracky\u2019s saga was like that too and all the new sagas that were created in Midgard seemed to be quite useful.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, you woke up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Helga entered the room at that time. She, that was wearing a blue dress instead of armor, looked like a princess inside a story.</p><br/><p>\u2018She really is a princess. A royal princess\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn spoke as if he had read Tae Ho\u2019s thoughts and then Helga started to speak. It was related about the celebratory banquet just like Cuchulainn had expected.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I will be waiting for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Helga expressed her manners gracefully and left the room. As the situation was as it was and it was a small kingdom to begin with, no people followed her back. Tae Ho washed himself with the warm water that was brought by an apprentice female knight and then went to the banquet Helga had told him about.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun\u2019s warrior!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun\u2019s warrior!\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as he entered the banquet hall, the warriors raised their cups and yelled. After calmly looking at the place he didn\u2019t only see Bracky and Harabal but also saw Siri, Notung, etc seated in the seats of honor.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho wasn\u2019t someone to neglect them, that were calling out Idun\u2019s name. He was about to wave his hand widely and answer.</p><br/><p>But it was at that moment. Tae Ho unconsciously turned his eyes. He didn\u2019t wave his hand widely, he didn\u2019t even do it properly.</p><br/><p>Because something other than that had caught his attention. In addition, the Unknown sword piece that was hanging in his waist had started to vibrate.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why did that appear here?\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn spoke in a bewildered voice as if reading out Tae Ho\u2019s thoughts out loud.</p><br/><p>The place Tae Ho\u2019s eyes reached. Something that was well adorned in the middle of the banquet.</p><br/><p>Rainbow colored letters entered Tae Ho\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 23 \u2013 Idun\u2019s warrior (2) &gt; End</p><br/>\n</div>"}

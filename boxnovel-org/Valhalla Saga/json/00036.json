As they covered it in layers and formed a barrier, not even a Giant with hundred eyes would be able to see through it.</p><br/><p>The cry of a dragon was heard from far away. It was the voice of the dark colored dragon, Nidhogg.</p><br/><p>It was a wicked creature that could cover the world with its terrible poison but it wasn\u2019t a problem yet. It wasn\u2019t able to smell the honey alcohol of the spring because of the smell of the poison coming from its own body.</p><br/><p>Booming sounds were heard along the cry. It was certainly Ratatosk that had come and busily went over the roots of Yggdrasil.</p><br/><p>He had memorized the curses of Nidhogg he was to deliver to Hraesvelgr and was climbing Yggdrasil hastily. The booming sound became more distant.</p><br/><p>Odin closed his only eye. He was seated below an ash tree he had planted himself and touched his eye patch with his rough hands.</p><br/><p>He came to this place every day. Even after having spent a fantastic night with tens of beautiful ladies or having faced countless enemies on the battlefield, he always came to Mimir\u2019s spring and waited for results like this.</p><br/><p>Three beautiful ladies reflected off the surface of Mimir\u2019s spring which was full of honey alcohol. They weren\u2019t in this place, but the three sisters you could see were seated close to each other and were knitting.</p><br/><p>These were the three sisters that divined the fate of the world.</p><br/><p>The eldest, Urd, held the threat of fate and the middle one, Verdandi, knitted it earnestly. The youngest one, Skuld, just saw what her sisters did and stealthily unknitted the threads.</p><br/><p>The past, which Urd could see, was unchangeable. The present, which Verdandi lived in, was filled with infinite possibilities.</p><br/><p>And the future, Skuld, looked at what hadn\u2019t been decided yet. It was just the possibilities drawn by the past and the present.</p><br/><p>The three sisters divinated the fate of the world. Skuld whispered the future she saw over the surface, and the head of Mimir that was placed on a wide rock read the movement of her lips. He analyzed what they had predicted and translated it into a language is understood.</p><br/><p>\u201cRagnarok is proceeding. It\u2019s just going forward and not retreating, so on the day the world wolf wakes from its slumber the foolish yet wise Odin that is resisting at the front will become dog food.\u201d</p><br/><p>Odin didn\u2019t even flinch at the insult. And the crow Munin, that was seated at his shoulder, also didn\u2019t show any movement.</p><br/><p>Mimir continued speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe space snake Jormungandr hasn\u2019t died yet. It will be reborn before you find it and it will decide its fate along with Thor.\u201d</p><br/><p>The following content was similar. The story he had heard hundreds and thousands of times didn\u2019t change.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe fires of Surtur will set the world on fire, and the possibility for his happening is 10.000 of 72.972.\u201d</p><br/><p>The part the world would perish was the same. But at that moment Odin opened his eyes widely.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say just now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mimir knew well which part Odin pointed. Because of that it didn\u2019t read another part again and said with a clear voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s 10.000 of 72.972.\u201d</p><br/><p>Odin stood up from his place. The numbers had changed. Actually, the numbers changing was a common thing. But it was important to what direction it changed to.</p><br/><p>The possibilities of annihilation always became bigger. Although it halted for a moment, in the end, it kept advancing.</p><br/><p>But right now, a change occurred for the first time.</p><br/><p>The probabilities lowered. Although it was merely one in ten thousand, it had certainly lowered compared to before.</p><br/><p>Odin approached Mimir\u2019s head. It sat in front of a wide rock and faced Mimir.</p><br/><p>he heard Nidhogg\u2019s cry from far away. Odin raised his head and looked at the sky. The crow Hugin was approaching after having passed through the dense fog.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun\u2019s warrior Tae Ho. The merits you have achieved in this expedition are big. I will also tell Ullr so there will be a reward for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as they returned to Valhalla, Gandur faced Tae Ho and hit her chest. Tae Ho also showed his manners by hitting his chest and answered with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho thought that it was a light greeting but Gandur thought differently. If Tae Ho wasn\u2019t in this expedition they wouldn\u2019t have been able to succeed. And the reason the warriors of Ullr\u2019s legion could return alive was thanks to Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>Because of that Gandur was sincerely thinking of requesting a reward to Ullr. Valhalla loved great warriors and they wished to receive a suitable treatment.</p><br/><p>As soon as Gandur finished speaking, the warriors of Ullr\u2019s legion gathered towards Tae Ho. The first one he said his farewell to was Siri.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake care, captain Siri.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSame goes for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Compared to Tae Ho, that was completely healthy, Siri still seemed to be in pain. However, now that they had returned to Valhalla she wouldn\u2019t need to worry that much.</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho, return safely.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFarewell warrior of Idun. Next time, we will return the favor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rolph and the other warriors also said their farewells and thanked him. Although he had been connected with Ullr\u2019s legion without any coincidence, he really wanted to keep being with them.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, Tae Ho. Shall we also return?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone finished their farewells and as Ullr\u2019s warriors returned after being led by Gandur, Heda grabbed on Tae Ho\u2019s hands and said.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho nodded but then he looked at the violet door that was connected to Svartalfheim. It was because there was someone that hadn\u2019t come with them.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you are thinking about Ragnar he will come soon. It seems like he\u2019s worried about what happened with the Mollo family. He said he would check on things.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar Lodbrok. Tae Ho\u2019s teacher that Heda invited.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said that Rasgrid was dispatched to the Mollo family right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGandur and Ullr\u2019s legion was dispatched to hunt the Basilisks. Things like investigating are Rasgrid\u2019s specialty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Now that the Mollo family, which they trusted in, had betrayed them they couldn\u2019t leave the entire investigation to the dark fairies. Although they couldn\u2019t meet in person, based on what Heda or Gandur said it seemed like Odin\u2019s legion which was led by Rasgrid got dispatched to the Mollo family as if taking turns with Ullr\u2019s legion.</p><br/><p>\u2018Rasgrid.\u2019</p><br/><p>Until a few days ago, she had stood on the same battlefield as him. He felt good even by listening to her name like this.</p><br/><p>But it was at that moment. Heda looked at Tae Ho\u2019s face that was remembering the battle of the fortress and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you miss Rasgrid?\u201d</p><br/><p>He thought he knew how he should reply.</p><br/><p>Because of that, Tae Ho answered with a calm face.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan that be as much as Heda, who I\u2019m glad to see every day?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou do speak well.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed like that was the correct answer, that Heda\u2019s steps became lighter.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>There were some ships docked at the port. Looking that Valkyries and warriors were coming and going, it seemed like a small-scaled expedition like Ullr\u2019s legion was leaving to an expedition.</p><br/><p>After passing by the grand ships and getting on the wooden boat, Heda started to hum and prepared to depart. Tae Ho just looked at her and after the ship left the dock he asked carefully.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, Heda. I have an item for you to check.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cItem?\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda tilted her head while stirring the oars and then placed them down and sat in front of Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho loosened the pocket that was tied around his waist and took out the unknown piece of the sword.</p><br/><p>\u201cI found it in the Basilisk I defeated. I wonder if it\u2019s a weapon from the great war.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although it was still an unknown item, it was still an epic graded one. If it really was from the great war, there was a high probability for it to be part of a famous weapon.</p><br/><p>Compared to Tae Ho, that only knew one weapon of the Norse mythology, Valmont, Heda that was a Valkyrie would be able to grasp what the item was.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda\u2019s eyes became serious as if she realized that it wasn\u2019t a normal item. Heda raised the piece of sword carefully and started to inspect it thoroughly.</p><br/><p>And how much time had passed? Heda raised her head with an exhausted face and Tae Ho pressed down his anxiety and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know what it is?\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda frowned as if she felt sorry for having disappointed him and shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, I don\u2019t. The magic felt from the hilt\u2026..It certainly isn\u2019t a normal item but I can\u2019t feel its property perhaps because of the aftereffect.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cProperty?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhose God this item belongs to, or from which genealogy it came. Perhaps it may be an item made by the dwarves, which simply doesn\u2019t have the power of the Gods in it.\u201d</p><br/><p>You couldn\u2019t look at it casually just because a God wasn\u2019t related to it. Of the several treasures of Valhalla, the ones that had the powers of God were rather the scarce type.</p><br/><p>Even the strongest weapon of Asgard, Mjolnir, was made by using the God\u2019s precious metal the Unt but basically, it was made by the skills of the dwarves.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Tae Ho, you somehow managed to find this. With the item in this situation, it shouldn\u2019t even enter your eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was lucky&gt;\u201d</p><br/><p>Actually, the rainbow-colored letters did catch his eyes.</p><br/><p>Heda checked on Tae Ho and then said in a bright voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough it\u2019s only a hilt, the magic it has is quite vast and it seems to be high quality. If we give it to a master dwarf of Valhalla, he may be able to put a new blade to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt certainly is unusable like this, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>As he asked implying if it was an epic ranked item, Heda thought for a moment and then answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cUmm\u2026.probably? But let\u2019s not fix it that hurriedly. I will try to investigate a bit more. If we find the traces of the Great War, we may be able to obtain some clues. Perhaps, it may still be useful like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I will trouble you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s something for a warrior of the legion. That\u2019s the job of a Valkyrie.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda smiled brightly and returned the piece of sword to Tae Ho and then grabbed the oars again. They could reach Idun\u2019s legion shortly after because the currents were fast.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe returned faster than expected so Idun may get surprised.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda tied up the wooden boat and smiled. Even taking into account the time he was lying down on the bed of the dark fairies, Tae Ho had returned in barely 3 days. Tae Ho remembered something at what she had said and then smirked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Something good?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun said that she would give me a gift after returning from this expedition.\u201d</p><br/><p>She had said so. He thought that he would see her after some weeks but for them to reunite after merely 3 days.</p><br/><p>\u2018She won\u2019t say that she didn\u2019t have the time to prepare anything because she didn\u2019t have time, right?\u2019</p><br/><p>She was still a God.</p><br/><p>Heda smiled without knowing that Tae Ho was thinking of bad things.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun\u2019s gift, I\u2019m also expecting towards it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will show it to you first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although they were the only ones.</p><br/><p>Heda accompanied Tae Ho in front of the shrine like always and then stepped back.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho entered the shrine. After he took a few steps a familiar scenery spread instead of the darkness.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy warrior Tae Ho.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreetings to Idun.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho naturally kneeled down and expressed his manners. Idun, that was standing in front of an apple tree, looked down at Tae Ho and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cI received the report. You also raised great merits this time too. If it wasn\u2019t you, we wouldn\u2019t have been able to disrupt the plans of the Giants.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s thanks to your blessing.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had actually been able to defeat the regenerator thanks to Idun\u2019s strength. He did yell Heda\u2019s name unconsciously but Tae Ho was really thankful towards Idun.</p><br/><p>Idun looked at Tae Ho that had answered calmly and then took some steps. She reached in front of Tae Ho and then lowered her posture and touched his cheeks.</p><br/><p>\u201cA regenerator isn\u2019t an existence an inferior ranked warrior is supposed to fight. I\u2019m really glad that you returned safely.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those were words that you could see the gentleness in it.</p><br/><p>The light that was so strong it covered her face felt warm.</p><br/><p>She touched Tae Ho\u2019s cheeks once more and then said with a playful voice after turning back.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst of all Tae Ho. They say you rode on a comrade? I heard she was a beautiful female warrior.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, that\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not scolding you. I heard everything from Heda.\u201d</p><br/><p>Idun laughed as if it was really a joke and then walked up to the apple tree she was standing at previously and then looked back at Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cI shall give you a gift as I promised for having returned and finished the expedition successfully.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was the time he had been waiting for. As vigor filled Tae Ho\u2019s eyes, Idun laughed again and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have prepared two things. Choose one from the two.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was just like he had predicted. Even before Tae Ho could react Idun took out a white coat from the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe first one is a flying horse wing clothes. If you wear it you will be able to transform to a horse that can fly through the sky.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA flying horse? Then a pegasus?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho didn\u2019t know well about Norse mythology but he did know a bit about Greek and Roman mythology. A pegasus was a white horse with wings that the hero of the Greek mythology, Bellerophon, rode on.</p><br/><p>Idun also seemed to know the name of Pegasus that she nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a gift Olympus sent to Asgard long ago. I was wondering if you would specifically like it as you like riding on things.\u201d</p><br/><p>Idun said as if teasing him but Tae Ho couldn\u2019t deny it.</p><br/><p>Because it really was a flying horse wing clothes.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho wasn\u2019t planning on wearing it himself. That was something he should make a comrade wear it.</p><br/><p>\u2018Captain Siri would be able to fly through the sky with that, right? And there\u2019s also Rolph.\u2019</p><br/><p>The two weren\u2019t the only ones. Anyone fighting with him as possible.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, no wait. Why should I even ride on Rolph?\u2019</p><br/><p>Rolph was left with a defeat and then Tae Ho started to think of the things he could do with the wing clothes. And Idun, that was looking at that Tae Ho, said casually.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt would be good if you have it in case you get to fight with Heda.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis other thing is a pocket.\u201d</p><br/><p>Idun slightly changed subjects and she took a white pocket the size of a palm this time.</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho, do you know about the treasure ship called Skidbladnir?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026..No.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a name he heard for the first time. He also wouldn\u2019t have to know that it was a ship if she hadn\u2019t told him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can receive favorable wind anywhere and at any time and when you fold it, it becomes small to the point you can put it in your pocket. The children of Ivaldi made this ship after being asked by Loki, and this pocket was also made by them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Simply said, this was a high-quality item made by master makers.</p><br/><p>\u201cEverything you put in the pocket becomes small. So you are able to put in many things in it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt becomes\u2026\u2026small?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, my warrior Tae Ho. Can I borrow one of your items?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Idun extended her hand Tae Ho took off his hawk wing clothes and gave it to her carefully.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Idun didn\u2019t even fold the wing clothes and brought it to the entrance of the pocket. And then, surprisingly enough the wing clothes that were much bigger than the pocket began to shrink to the size of a finger and got inside the pocket.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Idun took out the wing clothes again as if this wasn\u2019t all. She started to count slowly and when she counted up to three the wing clothes returned to its original size.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven after taking it back like this, it stays small for a moment. You can control the time. In addition, you don\u2019t have to worry about the items getting mixed because you can take out what you want directly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018This is really like an inventory that appears in games.\u2019</p><br/><p>No, it wasn\u2019t simply that. The function of shrinking it made him thought that there would be many situations in which he could use it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe name of this pocket is Unnir.\u201d</p><br/><p>Idun sealed the pocket prettily and then placed it on the air. With Idun at the middle, there were the flying horse wing clothes at her right and Unnir at her left.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, pick one.\u201d</p><br/><p>Idun\u2019s words were exceedingly cruel. To pick one of the two. She should have rather shown him one.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, whatever the case I\u2019m lucky I get to even choose one.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho decided to think positively and started to think with a serious face.</p><br/><p>Idun smiled again and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy warrior Tae Ho. Don\u2019t think too much. You will be able to get the other one after you raise another merit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because Tae Ho was the only warrior that could receive a treasure.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho thanked that Idun\u2019s legion was few on people once again and then started to look at the treasures after taking a breath.</p><br/><p>The flying horse wing clothes and Unnir.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho made his decision.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 11 \u2013 Unknown piece of sword (1) &gt; End</p><br/>\n</div>"}

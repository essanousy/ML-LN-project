His fate was connected to the evil and wicked ancient dragon that has existed with the World Tree, so wasn\u2019t this the strongest proof that Hraesvelg was born with the fate of a hero?</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg had gathered information about Nidhogg, but it wasn\u2019t easy to do so as Nidhogg lived in the roots. Not even the God of Messages, Hermod, could approach the roots.</p><br/><p>But Hraesvelg could luckily get a capable informer.</p><br/><p>The beast, Ratatoskr.</p><br/><p>He, that could freely come and go between the roots and the branches, told Hraesvelg many things about Nidhogg.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg was really a scary dragon.</p><br/><p>To start off, it was an evil creature. To the point that no other giants could compare to it.</p><br/><p>The dragon, that resented everything in the world, was raising a deadly poison that would one day cover the world, and it didn\u2019t stop there. It ate off the roots every day to make it fall down. If the three sisters didn\u2019t sprinkle the waters of life which could heal the injuries of the World Tree everyday, then the World Tree would have already crumbled.</p><br/><p>But it\u2019s mind wasn\u2019t the only wicked thing.</p><br/><p>It was a strong existence suitable of its name of an ancient dragon. Based on Ratatoskr\u2019s words, there was no other dragon that was as strong as it even if they searched in Asgard and Jotunheim.</p><br/><p>The biggest and strongest dragon.</p><br/><p>Everytime Ratatoskr visited the highest branch, he notified Hraesvelg of the curses Nidhogg was pouring unto the world.</p><br/><p>It was terrible just by listening to it.</p><br/><p>The black dragon, Nidhogg.</p><br/><p>That terrible and evil controller of shadows was Hraesvelg\u2019s fated enemy.</p><br/><p>The dragon had the same presence as a demon king so it could be said that Hraesvelg was born with the fate to defeat the demon king.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg was satisfied with his fate.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t laze away in his training for the fated duel that would one day come.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg didn\u2019t leave the highest branch just like Nidhogg didn\u2019t leave the roots.</p><br/><p>But only once.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg left the branches once in the past.</p><br/><p>It was when the Great War occurred in Asgard.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg wasn\u2019t that interested in how the Great War turned out, but regardless of that, the reason he left the highest branch was to prepare for the fight against Nidhogg.</p><br/><p>How strong would Hraesvelg be?</p><br/><p>How would the existences that lived below the branches fight?</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg saw a man in the world he first descended to.</p><br/><p>It was something the citizens of the highest branch and Vedrfolnir didn\u2019t know, but Hraesvelg experienced the first defeat of his life against that man.</p><br/><p>But he didn\u2019t feel bad.</p><br/><p>That man was an existence that represented the ideal of a hero.</p><br/><p>A great hero.</p><br/><p>The king of heroes.</p><br/><p>A shining existence that not even adding all the adjectives Hraesvelg knew of would be enough.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg admired him.</p><br/><p>He wanted to be like him to the point where he wanted to gain experience by becoming his disciple.</p><br/><p>But Hraesvelg was the owner of the highest branch. He had to return for his citizens.</p><br/><p>When the Great War ended, Hraesvelg could hear about that man from Ratatoskr.</p><br/><p>The man had faced a heroic death by facing countless enemies in the Great War.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg was deeply saddened, and he then grew determined.</p><br/><p>That he would one day become the same as that man.</p><br/><p>That he would become a Great Hero by putting that man as his objective.</p><br/><p>And his thoughts had remained the same even after a hundred years had passed.</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBracky!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho and Bracky called out to each other on a mountain road that connected to the fortress. They ran towards each other and shared hugs of men.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were alive!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou too, Bracky!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them yelled once again and embraced each other, but the two of them ended up inserting too much strength. Rather than inspiring hugs, it was more like a bear hug, which could be considered as a kind of attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuook! I surrender! Surrender! Why are you this strong?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPant! Pant! You too, Bracky!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the end, the one that loosened up was Bracky. The faces of the two were completely red from having used too much strength.</p><br/><p>And the woman that stared on at their stupid actions smiled bitterly from the side.</p><br/><p>\u201cHug me lightly, please.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCaptain Siri.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you to just call me Siri.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Siri lectured jokingly, Tae Ho smirked and opened his arms instead of replying. The two of them shared a natural and warm hug unlike the one with Bracky.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m really glad to see you. Really glad\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meeting up again with a comrade was always a joyous thing.</p><br/><p>In addition, Tae Ho was seeing the two of them in two years. The emotions he felt could only be different.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, isn\u2019t the difference in temperature too different?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bracky complained with a discomforted face. Siri snickered and Tae Ho answered with an obvious face.</p><br/><p>\u201cPut yourself in my position.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed. It\u2019s understandable. I will have to try it now that I thought about it. Siri! Receive my love!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will decline.\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri dodged simply by falling back and shook her head, and Bracky laughed at that.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t change at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAdenmaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha smiled brightly at Siri\u2019s call and then opened her arms just like Tae Ho had done. She hugged lightly with Siri and then placed her lips on her forehead.</p><br/><p>\u201cMay Idun\u2019s blessing accompany you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too, me too.\u201d</p><br/><p>The one that\u2019d gotten excited was obviously Bracky, but this time, Adenmaha acted the same as Siri.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will decline.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSob, sob. You only hate me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bracky dropped his shoulders in an exaggerated way. That wasn\u2019t because he was really disappointed but more because he wanted to make others laugh.</p><br/><p>And it was at that moment\u2013</p><br/><p>\u201cI will do it then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bracky and Siri grew surprised at the unfamiliar voice and turned to look. A woman with black hair, who seemed to have just arrived after following Adenmaha, was standing in the middle of the road.</p><br/><p>Just by looking at her appearance, she seemed to be a Goddess. She was also really tall at the level of possibly surpassing the height of Siri, and thanks to her black hair, her white face was really beautiful in contrast.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg opened her arms while Bracky blinked. She was just about to bless Bracky and Siri, so Adenmaha hurriedly grabbed her arm and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is Nidhogg. She\u2019s a pure girl, so don\u2019t say anything weird. And don\u2019t have evil intentions either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you only looking at me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bracky pouted, and Adenmaha spoke to Nidhogg.</p><br/><p>\u201cNidhogg, what did I say? Didn\u2019t I tell you to not approach unfamiliar people as you please?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes. Adenmaha did say that. I will listen to your words.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow nice.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha stood on her toes and stroked her head. Nidhogg smiled as if she really liked Adenmaha\u2019s stroke, and Bracky and Siri tilted their heads at the scene that was somewhat twisted but was nice to see simultaneously.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like we need some introductions.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was Siri who spoke up. Tae Ho stood up and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s Nidhogg. I will introduce her properly at a later time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bracky just nodded, but it was different for Siri. It was because she immediately thought of the black dragon with the name of Nidhogg.</p><br/><p>But Tae Ho had already said that he would explain later. Siri was someone that would believe in Tae Ho until the end.</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand. Nidhogg, I\u2019m Siri, and he\u2019s Bracky.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Nidhogg. I\u2019m the second dragon of Tae Ho master. Nice to meet you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg waved her hand and greeted them like a child, and then, Siri and Bracky turned to look at Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Why are you looking at me like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>The eyes as if they were looking at a bastard.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s all your retribution.\u2019</p><br/><p>Bracky opened his mouth once again while Cuchulainn laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe second? Is the first dragon Rolo?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, why does Rolo appear here? That\u2019s obviously me. And shouldn\u2019t you be surprised by the fact that she\u2019s a dragon?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bracky laughed as Adenmaha got angry.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s speak about the details at a later time. Whatever the case, nice to meet you Nidhogg. Treat me well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSame here. Tae Ho master likes Siri and Bracky a lot, so I also like you too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg embraced Siri and said. Siri got a bit perplexed, but she had already hugged with Adenmaha and Tae Ho. And in addition, she didn\u2019t dislike Nidhogg\u2019s childlike affection, so she hugged her back warmly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Tae Ho, aren\u2019t Siri and I different?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, now that I see\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>He could feel it even without using the \u2018Eyes of the Dragon\u2019. The amount of runes Bracky and Siri had had increased exponentially, and they had become much stronger than before.</p><br/><p>Bracky smirked at Tae Ho\u2019s admiration and shrugged his shoulders as if acting cool.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe became like this after fighting without stop in these fifteen days. Don\u2019t you think that we will soon become superior-ranked warriors?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, good. Now it\u2019s only a matter of time to catch up to you\u2026\u2026What? When did you get that strong?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The reason behind Bracky\u2019s shock was simple. It was because Tae Ho released the aura he\u2019d been hiding.</p><br/><p>If one reached the level Bracky and Siri were at, they also became able to sense the amount of runes another had just by looking.</p><br/><p>Siri mumbled with a dumbfounded face.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe amount of runes\u2026\u2026is really incredible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho would probably have more runes even if he gathered Siri\u2019s and Bracky\u2019s runes together.</p><br/><p>Bracky asked in his excitement compared to the relatively calm Siri,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, you only fought in the time we didn\u2019t see you? No, the runes are secondary, but how did your skills increase that much? Is that possible in only two months?\u201d</p><br/><p>What Bracky emphasized was Tae Ho\u2019s skills rather than his runes.</p><br/><p>He could feel it just by looking at his posture. Even Tae Ho\u2019s aura had changed. Bracky felt that he wouldn\u2019t even become Tae Ho\u2019s opponent even if they fought with pure skills.</p><br/><p>\u201cA lot of things happened. Ah, and I didn\u2019t fight that much the past fifteen days. I think I only fought properly about two times.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTwo times? Two times and you gathered that much runes? Just what did you fight against?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe World Wolf, an ancient dragon, and a giant king.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bracky asked back with a dumbfounded face, and even the usually calm Siri couldn\u2019t help but grow bewildered.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho shrugged his shoulders as if he enjoyed the reaction of the two people. It was because there was something else in which they should have been surprised about.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will speak the details later, as Odin has almost arrived.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWh, who?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOdin-nim. The King of Gods.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bracky and Siri couldn\u2019t speak anymore.</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>A few hours after the joyous encounter.</p><br/><p>When Tae Ho arrived at the fortress, he shared greetings with Rasgrid and the other Valkyries and started to speak about the things that had happened to him.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho\u2019s group had faced several adventures, but Bracky\u2019s group didn\u2019t fall back either.</p><br/><p>And rather, just by looking at the density, Bracky\u2019s group was higher. Compared to Tae Ho, who had been out of commision for almost ten of the past twenty days, Bracky\u2019s group had fought fiercely everyday.</p><br/><p>When the conversation concluded to an extent, they opened up a banquet and started to eat and drink like they did in Valhalla.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that the fortress had plenty of provisions, but everyone had accepted Bracky\u2019s claim that if they didn\u2019t open a banquet today, they would never do it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was fun. Bracky is fun. It\u2019s fun being with him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg arrived the room that was provided to Tae Ho and mumbled with sleepy eyes. Adenmaha assisted her and said to Tae Ho,</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will be departing tomorrow morning, so end it here and go to sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. Have a good night.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSleep well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg smiled merrily and staggered while walking and then tried to walk to Tae Ho\u2019s bedroom. But Adenmaha was a bit faster than her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, where do you think you are going?\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha grabbed Nidhogg\u2019s arm tightly, but she grumbled with still sleepy eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will sleep with Tae Ho master. I also have to bless him today. I couldn\u2019t do it yesterday. Tae Ho master likes blessings a lot. A lot\u201d</p><br/><p>Blessing.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha opened her eyes sharply and asked. Her eyes were really cold and fierce.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho grew nervous unconsciously and answered quickly,</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s just a blessing. Only a blessing. Because of the \u2018Warrior that had a Valkyrie Meet Him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><br/><p>He did have a fair cause because the \u2018Warrior that had a Valkyrie Meet Him\u2019 needed blessings of Valkyries to increase its completion rate.</p><br/><p>\u201cNidhogg is tired. I want to bless master and go to sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg freed herself from Adenmaha\u2019s hands and approached Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, Nidho\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSleep well, Tae Ho master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg blessed Tae Ho like that and it was the best blessing like she always did.</p><br/><p>\u201cMay Idun\u2019s blessing accompany you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg finished her blessing while smiling merrily and then lay down on her bed as if collapsing. She then fell asleep immediately.</p><br/><p>One person disappeared, and only two were left.</p><br/><p>The first one that opened her mouth was Adenmaha.</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho, mas\u2026ter?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, so\u2026\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know why he should make an excuse, but he felt like he had to do it.</p><br/><p>But it was at that moment\u2013</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will also give you! The best blessing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha yelled with a red face.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Adenmaha?\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha didn\u2019t stop. Thinking about it, she felt that it was too unfair. Not even her, who could be said to be a formal member of Idun\u2019s legion, had been able to bless Tae Ho, but some newcomer that came from who-knows-where dared to bless him?</p><br/><p>The excited Adenmaha pushed Tae Ho to his bed. If it was strength, Tae Ho was certainly stronger than her, but he couldn\u2019t resist her properly.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha took a deep breath. She faced Tae Ho, and he flinched and flushed unconsciously.</p><br/><p>He had received the best blessing from several people because of a just cause, but it was different this time. Thinking that the one he was facing was Adenmaha, he couldn\u2019t treat her as he did with Freya.</p><br/><p>While Tae Ho fell in chaos that was hard to describe, Adenmaha had also fallen in her own chaos. She trembled with a completely red face and yelled.</p><br/><p>\u201cCl-close your eyes! It\u2019s embarrassing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, wouldn\u2019t it be better to not give the best blessing?</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s your retribution.\u2019</p><br/><p>When Tae Ho closed his eyes after he\u2019d gotten pushed by Adenmaha\u2019s strength, Cuchulainn started to laugh.</p><br/><p>And it was after that\u2013</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I will do it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha grew determined and said. Tae Ho clenched his fist in the nervousness and then felt a soft and warm feeling.</p><br/><p>The best blessing.</p><br/><p>It was special indeed, and Tae Ho could only open his eyes.</p><br/><p>[Synchro rate: 76%]</p><br/><p>The synchro rate had increased. It, that had increased up to 75% after the fight against Hrumbak, had increased one more percent.</p><br/><p>\u2018No, this isn\u2019t even a fight, so can the synchro rate really increase with this?\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn was shocked, but originally, the synchro rate didn\u2019t only increase through battles. Tae Ho could then realize why the synchro rate had increased. It was because he could see another sentence of light that Cuchulainn couldn\u2019t see.</p><br/><p>[Saga: The Master of Extreme Cold]</p><br/><p>The second dragon the dragon knight, Kalsted, had made a contract with.</p><br/><p>The old enemy and twin star of the first dragon, Shooting Star, Master of Flames, was Javier, Master of Extreme Cold.</p><br/><p>A seal of Javier was then carved into Adenmaha just like the seal of Shooting Star had been carved into Rolo.</p><br/><p>It was a saga that should have originally been created when Tae Ho\u2019s synchro rate reached the 70%, but it had only taken shape now as he didn\u2019t have anyone worthy to engrave it on.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha blinked as she understood instinctively what had happened to her. Her eyes which had grown mottled red because of the embarrassment started to show happiness.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m now a real dragon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Increasing in rank from a sea serpent to a frost-white dragon.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho nodded and grew happy along with Adenmaha. And Cuchulainn, who\u2019d been silently watching at all of it, said shortly,</p><br/><p>\u2018This is crazy.\u2019</p><br/><p>The ones that were meant to become big would be able to do anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cMay Idun\u2019s blessing accompany you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha gave one more surprise blessing to Tae Ho, now that he had dropped his guard.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 41 \u2013 The highest branch (1) &gt; End</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/valhalla-saga-chapter-139\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 139\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/valhalla-saga-chapter-141\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 141\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"95570\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

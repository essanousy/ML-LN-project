There were no polises or even small villages near the entrance as expected of a path that led to the world of the dead.</p><br/><p>Just looking at the map, it was more comfortable to travel through the southern sea in the first place and then move to the east once again.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s because they would be able to arrive at the entrance of the underworld without having to pass through Artemis\u2019 sphere of influence.</p><br/><p>But Athena and Apollo insisted on moving like this.</p><br/><p>There were two reasons for this.</p><br/><p>The first one was the geography. There was only a wide and open field at the west of the entrance. Because of that, the location of the group could only be exposed even if they used the stealth blessing.</p><br/><p>The second one was Zeus\u2019 force.</p><br/><p>The connecting path to Asgard was empty when the group had come to this place but there was a high probability the heroes that served Zeus were protecting the fortress of the path by now.</p><br/><p>If they also were exposed in this situation they would be surrounded by many enemies even before they reached near the entrance.</p><br/><p>Athena, who was just standing silently while listening to Patroclus explain about the route they would be taking, frowned. She turned to look at the polis below the cliff and spoke to the group.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like moving stealthily ends here. Glaucus still hasn\u2019t sensed the children of Ares within his sensing range but I\u2019m sure they are chasing after us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Glaucus was complaining about the weird feeling he had been getting for a few days already. It seems like they were chasing them outside of Glaucus\u2019 sensing range at a really slight distance.</p><br/><p>There were outstanding hunters among the amazoness. It was plentily possible to do that.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t that far away from the entrance to the underworld. We would have to pass a part of Artemis\u2019 sacred force but\u2026it will be fine if we cross it the fastest we can.\u201d</p><br/><p>Artemis proposed the path to the east instead of the east of Artemis\u2019 sacred force.</p><br/><p>Even though it was inside of the influence of the ones that wanted to destroy the world, Artemis\u2019s sacred force wasn\u2019t like that at the east and the north. You could say that it was a sort of a buffer zone that existed between two countries.</p><br/><p>In addition, Artemis should be focusing on the west where Apollo\u2019s polises were at so there was a high probability they won\u2019t care about the east that was already inside the influence of the ones that wanted to destroy the world.</p><br/><p>[Athena is right.]</p><br/><p>[If the children of Ares are chasing us at a close distance, our destination will be exposed soon.]</p><br/><p>[If that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s better to hurry up to our destination before they are able to do something.]</p><br/><p>[If we reach the entrance of the underworld, Hades will lend us his strength.]</p><br/><p>But of course, there was a really slight probability Hades had turned a being wanting to destroy the world.</p><br/><p>But they decided not to think of that probability. It was because there would really be no hope if even Hades had turned.</p><br/><p>\u2018If that really is the case, we can only escape.\u2019</p><br/><p>If Hades had turned into a being wanting to destroy the world, the land near the entrance would have also changed to the land of the ones wanting to destroy the world. They would know the situation when they got near the entrance so if the worst were to cime escaping like Cuchulainn had said was their best option.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, let\u2019s depart immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho finished speaking and turned to look at everyone at the group. The meaning behind that was that they should say something if they had an opinion.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will follow the will of the commander.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we are going to go anyways, going there quickly should be the best.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ingrid and Bracky said and the group put on a faint smile. Even the normal maiden Sybilla wasn\u2019t showing fear perhaps because her connection with Apollo was being maintained.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will entrust it to you then Rolo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rolo frowned at Tae Ho\u2019s words but then let out a sigh. But he turned around like that and glanced at Tae Ho instead of spreading his wings.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s an urgent thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Tae Ho understood his thoughts and answered, Rolo hit his beaks with a face full of complaints but he let out a sigh and spread his wings in the end.</p><br/><p>[Saga: Master of flames]</p><br/><p>Everyone got on top of Rolo after transforming into Shootingstar. Gandur and Siri spread the stealth blessing at the same time to hide the aftershock generated by the flight as most as possible and Tae Ho used several sagas overlapping them.</p><br/><p>[Saga: The charge of the warrior is like a storm]</p><br/><p>[Saga: The one that conquers dragons]</p><br/><p>[Saga: The one that rode on a Goddess]</p><br/><p>Shiny light covered Rolo\u2019s body. After that, Rolo\u2019s appearance changed slightly and almost everyone in the group smiled bitterly.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go Lilly!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m jealous. I also want to become master\u2019s strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rolo was more bothered at Drakon Ismenios that was sincerely jealous rather than Bracky teasing him.</p><br/><p>But he decided to concentrate only in flying. He flew up with rough stroke of his wings and charged in rage.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>The queen of the Amazoness Pentesilea noticed the changes. She, who had the sharpest senses and the fastest feet among her sisters, fluttered her red hair and entered Glaucus\u2019 sensing range.</p><br/><p>\u2018Certainly.\u2019</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t feel Glaucus. She looked at a distant place and then noticed the small change that occurred in the sky.</p><br/><p>They were hiding themselves with some mystical magic but they couldn\u2019t hide completely. Rough wind was blowing. When she focused divine power in her eyes a huge and red existence appeared like magic.</p><br/><p>Pentesilea didn\u2019t hesitate anymore and blew her whistle. She gathered her sisters and at the same time used some magic to summon a horse she received from her father Ares.</p><br/><p>\u2018The southeast.\u2019</p><br/><p>The direction the red dragon was flying to.</p><br/><p>Pentesilea charged with her horse and used some divine power once again. She sent what she saw to her father Ares.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>The red dragon entered the territory of Artemis. Most of the humans living in the polis didn\u2019t notice that. Some sensitive ones looked up at the sky but the only thing they could see was a red trace that scattered like smoke.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>Ares frowned. He stood up at a chariot advancing explosively and glared at the south.</p><br/><p>As expectedly, Athena was heading to the entrance of the underworld.</p><br/><p>It meant that Ares had read Athena\u2019s play perfectly.</p><br/><p>But he couldn\u2019t be happy. It was because one of the plans he had set up had gone wrong.</p><br/><p>\u2018Artemis you useless bitch.\u2019</p><br/><p>He had sent some factions to Poseidon and Artemis but the one Ares was actually expecting something from was Artemis.</p><br/><p>The ruler of the sea Poseidon had some influence in rivers or lakes but it was really weak compared to what he could display at the sea.</p><br/><p>It was impossible to send forces to the entrance of the underworld that was located deep inland.</p><br/><p>But it was different for Artemis. In the first place, her sacred force wasn\u2019t that far away from the entrance.</p><br/><p>Artemis would ambush them near the entrance and Ares would strike from behind.</p><br/><p>It was a strategy to obtain victory against Athena, who criticized him heavily saying that he was a fool that didn\u2019t know of strategies and only knew how to charge forward.</p><br/><p>But Artemis didn\u2019t respond. She heard something from a faction of Ares and became obsessed with a small thing.</p><br/><p>\u2018That means that the polises of Apollo are empty.\u2019</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t want to admit it but she had to defend without being able to attack because Idun\u2019s warrior concerned her.</p><br/><p>But now, they knew of the location of Idun\u2019s warrior. In addition, she also learned that he wouldn\u2019t be able to obstruct her.</p><br/><p>Then, she would attack the polises of Apollo. She make them yield and make them hers. She would take everything that belonged to her brother and in the end make her brother her slave.</p><br/><p>It was like Demeter had said. The 12 Olympians that had become beings wanting to destroy the world became more extreme.</p><br/><p>The most important thing for Artemis was to put Apollo in her hands, not someone like Athena\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Artemis and her army resumed the attack on the polises of Apollo. because of that she could sense Tae Ho\u2019s group passing through her sacred force but she let them be.</p><br/><p>The rage and resentment she had towards Idun\u2019s warrior still existed but she would be able to become stronger if she occupied the polises of Apollo. Taking Apollo for herself would be another thing but capturing a mere maiden would be meaningless.</p><br/><p>Apollo sensed that Artemis wanted to attack his polises. He felt hurt when thinking of what the polises would go through and the divine power that would get cut off but he decided to be satisfied at the current situation.</p><br/><p>\u2018Artemis, my beloved sister. I really can\u2019t get myself to hate you.\u2019</p><br/><p>Because she didn\u2019t become an obstacle at the most decisive moment.</p><br/><p>Someone would have misunderstood his words as a mockery but Apollo was being serious. He felt deep love at Artemis that decided to seize his polises instead of stopping them.</p><br/><p>Rolo continued to charge.</p><br/><p>Pentesilea and the children of Ares charged but they couldn\u2019t close the distance with the red dragon.</p><br/><p>The speed of Rolo after sacrificing many things for the group really resembled a meteor.</p><br/><p>Ares retrieved his whip. He inserted his red divine power into the horses that were running with all their strength and made them surpass their limits.</p><br/><p>Rolo passed over the sacred force of Artemis.</p><br/><p>Pentesilea and the children of Ares followed the path Rolo passed through and entered the sacred force of Artemis.</p><br/><p>They had almost caught up with the children of Ares that were moving from the south to the north.</p><br/><p>\u201cAres is coming.\u201d</p><br/><p>Athena said while lying down in Rolo\u2019s back. Her blue eyes changed like the eyes of an owl and she looked a thousand miles away.</p><br/><p>The children of Ares were running wild. She couldn\u2019t see them directly but she could feel Ares\u2019 divinity surging up like flames.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t decrease our speed. Fly a bit faster oh beautiful red dragon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Athena stroke Rolo\u2019s scales and said. Rolo was annoyed at the word \u2018beautiful\u2019 but he didn\u2019t decrease his speed.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho, Adenmaha and Nidhogg released their divine power from Idun and granted new strength to Rolo.</p><br/><p>Idun\u2019s blessing fell on him that had become a Valkyrie of Idun temporarily.</p><br/><p>About an hour like that.</p><br/><p>Gandur, that was checking her surroundings, yelled something. The surging wind and thunder covered her voice but everyone understood what she was trying to say.</p><br/><p>There was a big hole.</p><br/><p>An open black hole in the middle of the plains.</p><br/><p>It was cold and shady. It was a place that made the believers feel an instinctive fear.</p><br/><p>But Athena cheered and Ingrid also let out a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>It was because they couldn\u2019t sense the aura of the beings wanting to destroy the world.</p><br/><p>Rasgrid looked behind her. She didn\u2019t have clairvoyance like Athena but she could still feel it.</p><br/><p>She could feel the rage of the God of war. His flames like divinity were spreading like fire. It was clear he had joined with his children.</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry up! If we reach the deepest place of the hole and cross the river of Acheron with the boatman Charon, Ares won\u2019t be able to chase after us anymore!\u201d</p><br/><p>Athena used her divine power and spoke in the heads of everyone.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho granted more strength to Rolo and Rolo squeezed out the little strength he had and entered the hole.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 52 \u2013 The pursuers (7) &gt; End</p><hr/><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/>\n</div>"}

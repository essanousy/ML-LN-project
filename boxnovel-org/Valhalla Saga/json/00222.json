The curtain of the night covered everything.</p><br/><p>It now passed the level of divine power. It was similar to what he felt when he first faced Heracles. No, precisely speaking, what Heracles made him feel was only a portion of it.</p><br/><p>The world itself.</p><br/><p>Nyx became the night. Became the world. The darkness of Erebos filled the emptiness of Tartarus. The power of the new ancient Gods pulled the power of the primeval Gods that had no personality.</p><br/><p>Protogenoi.</p><br/><p>The ancient Gods that were born with the world. The existences that could be said to be part of the world.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why they could become the world.</p><br/><p>What did opposing the world mean?</p><br/><p>What did becoming the enemy of the world mean?</p><br/><p>Nyx taught them that.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>The ones that stayed behind to sustain the connecting path of Asgard and Olympus couldn\u2019t move. They just stood still dumbfoundedly as if they had frozen and looked at the dark blue sea that started to infiltrate it.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t sweep Asgards\u2019 side but there was no guarantee it would stay like this forever. It seemed like they were looking at water that was about to overflow.</p><br/><p>Ragnar, that had stayed behind to defend, held his silence. He couldn\u2019t even sense what was happening in Olympus.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why he could only think of one thing.</p><br/><p>If that night had become Tae Ho\u2019s enemy.</p><br/><p>If the world called Olympus became their enemy.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh Odin.\u201d</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t say anything else. That was the most he could say.</p><br/><p>Ragnar turned to look at his waist. The axe Odin entrusted to him before leaving was hanging on that place.</p><br/><p>What Odin left behind just in case.</p><br/><p>The last Godly weapon he made when he was still the master.</p><br/><p>\u2018If things go wrong cut down the connecting path. Close the doors and protect Asgard. Ragnar Lodbrok, king of vikings, I will leave it to your judgement.\u2019</p><br/><p>The warriors of Valhalla turned to look at Ragnar. Ragnar gripped his axe instead of replying to their gazes and then looked at the night that overflowed beyond the connection.</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar said. He put strength once again in his hand holding the axe.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>Idun panted. She grabbed her own shoulders and bursted in tears.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t hear him even though the connecting path was still there.</p><br/><p>The night obstructed everything. SHe couldn\u2019t feel Tae Ho anymore.</p><br/><p>There was nothing Idun could do. Curling down and crying was everything she could do.</p><br/><p>What had happened? Why did things turn out like this? They barely got together. He even managed to defeat the strongest of Olympus, Heracles.</p><br/><p>The night sky.</p><br/><p>The existence that could only be called as being absolute.</p><br/><p>The opposite of Idun the Goddess of life, the Goddess of night that was filled with the power of death.</p><br/><p>Idun trembled in fear.</p><br/><p>Heda wiped off her tears and said to her, that was hesitating.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s go.\u2019</p><br/><p>Idun put a dumbfounded expression for a moment. She knew what Heda was talking about and also understood what she was requesting.</p><br/><p>\u2018Heda.\u2019</p><br/><p>Heda said once again.</p><br/><p>Idun cried and nodded. She stood up and started to walk.</p><br/><p>She got out of the residence of Idun for the first time since being born.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>What could have happened?</p><br/><p>Odin understood.</p><br/><p>He could understand it when the lightning of Thor subsided and his great magic got destroyed. He also barely grasped what Nyx did to Zeus and what was the ceremony Zeus made.</p><br/><p>Nyx hadn\u2019t absorbed the power of the other primeval Gods.</p><br/><p>Several primeval Gods also didn\u2019t descend on Zeus\u2019 body at the same time.</p><br/><p>If you compared it to the sacred forces of Olympus, Nyx was the core polis. She had connected the power of the primeval Gods that cooperated with her to make a big lump of strength. In addition, the primeval Gods that didn\u2019t hold the ceremony were naturally attracted.</p><br/><p>The ancient Gods of Olympus were beings that had become one with the world. Because of that, not even Zeus was able to become a plate that contained the power of the primeval Gods completely. Nyx said that she restructured him to become a plate but there was still a limit.</p><br/><p>Because of that, Nyx descended the night. She dyed the world with her own color and used the world as her plate.</p><br/><p>It was a bit contradictory but it was still possible.</p><br/><p>The one that was still the core was Zeus. The current situation was possible because of the core called Zeus.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why they just had to break the plate, that was Zeus. If they cut the connection from Nyx and the other primeval Gods and brought an end to the night they had some probabilities to win.</p><br/><p>But how?</p><br/><p>What could they do with the current Nyx as their opponents?</p><br/><p>They had to escape.</p><br/><p>That was Odin\u2019s judgement. That was the only option he had as the cunning God of war.</p><br/><p>What would have Loki said if he was here?</p><br/><p>Odin smiled bitterly. The words he would have said was already decided.</p><br/><p>I will stop him so flee.</p><br/><p>Odin staying alive gave more probabilities to win than him.</p><br/><p>Odin looked at the night with his only eye. At that instant he made a judgement and ordered to the Gods of Asgard.</p><br/><p>Escape. Fight. Buy time.</p><br/><p>He told Freya to escape and told Ullr and Tyr to plan for the later days.</p><br/><p>But he didn\u2019t say anything to Thor. He spoke to the God of Thunder of Asgard that was the strongest and that\u2019s why he had to stay back.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s die together my son.\u2019</p><br/><p>As we are the only ones that can buy time.</p><br/><p>\u2018We won\u2019t die father.\u2019</p><br/><p>Thor stood up from his charge, that was stopped with the descent of the night. He had already tasted Nyx\u2019s power so his will wasn\u2019t bent even by a little. He was still the strong God of thunder.</p><br/><p>The one that knew of no fear. The one facing confidently no matter what kind of enemy it was.</p><br/><p>Odin smiled. He ignored Freya that was despairing saying that they would die together. He ordered Ullr and Tyr to take Freya by force and then took a step.</p><br/><p>Odin was different from Thor.</p><br/><p>He knew what fear was. He was the one that had struggled until the end even though he had been sensing the promised destruction.</p><br/><p>The one fighting with fear. And the one that never gave up.</p><br/><p>New rune magic appeared in Odin\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>[Escape.]</p><br/><p>Gaia was resisting. She was enduring with all her strength on getting her strength taken away by that night, that was an gathering of primeval Gods.</p><br/><p>Because of that she wasn\u2019t able to assist Tae Ho. She was also able to transmit her voice only now.</p><br/><p>[You can\u2019t win. Prepare for later. That\u2019s your only hope.]</p><br/><p>Heracles had lost.</p><br/><p>Hades was asleep and Poseidon had perished. Zeus had become Nyx\u2019s plate.</p><br/><p>There Was no more hope in Olympus. The only he she could lean her hopes on was the master of Asgard, Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>Gaia curled down. SHe couldn\u2019t speak to Tae Ho anymore. SHe grinded her teeth and resisted.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gaia\u2019s words are true. Escape.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn spoke in a low voice. He was speaking in a roiled up way.</p><br/><p>They had no chances to win right now. It was doubtful whether they would get a sharp card after fleeing but whatever the case, they had to evade death for now. That was the only hope Tae Ho had just like Gaia said.</p><br/><p>But Tae Ho couldn\u2019t move rashly. He couldn\u2019t flee like Gaia and Cuchulainn said.</p><br/><p>Because everything would end the moment he escaped. All the ones in the mount of Olympus would face death.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the same anyways.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nyx said. She looked down at Tae Ho and waved her hand lightly.</p><br/><p>She moved the world.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>Darkness surged up from below. Hands, that were the same in numbers as to the ones at the mount, surged up from the ground and grabbed the ones close to them.</p><br/><p>It was death, that was inside the region of Tartarus the ruler of the underworld.</p><br/><p>The impartial and fair thing for everyone found the ones that were in the mount.</p><br/><p>The ones that couldn\u2019t evade it collapsed without even screaming. The ones that were strong and sturdy like the warriors of Valhalla didn\u2019t die but that was all. They could only endure it and stay standing.</p><br/><p>The death of Tartarus also found the ones that wanted to destroy the world. The Gigantes let out screams and struggled and Dionysius let out a laugh. Aphrodite screamed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAdenmaha! Adenmaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>The black hand of death that couldn\u2019t be evaded grabbed Adenmaha\u2019s ankle. Nidhogg grabbed the hand of Adenmaha that was collapsed in the ground and cried. She released her vast divine power and magic power at the same time to drive away the deaths at their surroundings in an instant.</p><br/><p>But that was all.</p><br/><p>Darkness appeared once again. Death continued to stand up no matter how many times she shook it off.</p><br/><p>\u201cAdenmaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg embraced Adenmaha. The only thing Adenmaha could do after being weakened by death was embracing Nidhogg.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg cried and released her power once again. She rolled her eyes to find Hydra and to save at least more people and kept releasing her power.</p><br/><p>For how long would she be able to endure it?</p><br/><p>\u2018Master.\u2019</p><br/><p>Adenmaha buried her face in Nidhogg\u2019s chest. She transmitted the little bit of strength she had to Nidhogg, that was getting weaker by the time, and closed her eyes.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>Odin advanced forward. Ullr grabbed Freya and Tyr opened up a path.</p><br/><p>Athena understood Odin\u2019s actions. That\u2019s why she also told Hephaestus to escape with Demeter. She grabbed her sword and slashed death. She started to run forward as if ignoring the one rising up again.</p><br/><p>Thor raised Mjolnir. He called forth lightning once again and flew up.</p><br/><p>Nyx moved her hand again. This time, thunder flashed. The number of thunder was the same as the beings in the mount of Olympus, just like how it was for death. The hundreds of thousands of thunder got concentrated in fewer than a hundred people. It was an attack of the world itself so there was no need to aim or detect.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg breathed roughly. She embraced Adenmaha that had collapsed. She had found where Hydra was but she couldn\u2019t get to her. She could only protect Adenmaha from the hundred streaks of lightning.</p><br/><p>Athena couldn\u2019t endure it. She kneeled down and darkness attacked her from behind.</p><br/><p>Siri looked at the flashing thunder and closed her eyes and then opened them again. She got surprised as she wasn\u2019t injured at all and when she looked up she bursted in tears.</p><br/><p>Bracky smiled. He kneeled down after having received thousands of lightning bolts in her stead. He didn\u2019t move anymore.</p><br/><p>The army of dragons collapsed. Death covered them after strength left their bodies. THe number of dragons that couldn\u2019t endure it anymore and accepted death increased in an instant.</p><br/><p>Thor resisted the lightning. He thrusted Mjolnir in front of him and blocked the thousands of lightning bolts falling down at him with an overwhelming power. He didn\u2019t stop there but also advanced.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather!\u201d</p><br/><p>Thor yelled and Odin reacted. He tricked death as the God of magic. He passed the black lightning and charged beyond Tae Ho, and to Nyx.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho was in a state that he couldn\u2019t move. A huge number of black lightning bolts were falling down on him without stop.</p><br/><p>The number was even bigger than the number that was falling down at Thor and Odin.</p><br/><p>Odin passed Tae Ho. He then transmitted his thoughts in that moment.</p><br/><p>Nyx hadn\u2019t become the world completely yet. There was also a limit in her strength. If the lightning bolts receded, she wouldn\u2019t be able to use the same power again.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why he should dodge then. That Thor and himself would make an opening somehow.</p><br/><p>Find a way to cut down the connection with the primeval Gods. That\u2019s the only hope.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t allow objections. Odin kept advancing forward and used a great magic. Even though he lost his seat of the master, he had recovered all the power of his time thanks to his born natural enemy, the World Wolf, having died.</p><br/><p>His magic suited the king of Gods.</p><br/><p>He tricked death once again. He pushed aside the lightning bolts to a weird place and reached in front of Nyx.</p><br/><p>\u201cOdin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nyx said and Odin looked at her eyes. He activated the magic that contained an overwhelming amount of power in front of her.</p><br/><p>Suicide. What Loki did.</p><br/><p>Nyx laughed. She grabbed Odin\u2019s right hand and suppressed his magic. She then dispersed the great magic that was about to explode.</p><br/><p>\u201cI knew you were going to do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Odin said. He waved his left hand the moment his magic got dispersed and activated the real card he had.</p><br/><p>Space leap, that was Loki\u2019s specialty.</p><br/><p>The one that appeared by tearing space was Thor. He swung Mjolnir covered in blue thunder towards Nyx.</p><br/><p>Odin kneeled down. Nyx got pushed back greatly. A little bit of blood flowed down from her lips after she got hit in her chest.</p><br/><p>The attack worked. She hadn\u2019t become the complete world yet just like Odin thought. No matter how she looked externally, the one in front of them was Zeus and if that body broke the power of the primeval Gods that had become one would scatter.</p><br/><p>But it was only that.</p><br/><p>Odin couldn\u2019t stop the enraged death from charging. What flashed in front of his eyes right before they closed was that their attack worked on Nyx but Thor got pushed back in the end.</p><br/><p>It was because he had used too much strength on blocking the thousands of black lightning bolts.</p><br/><p>Zeus\u2019 weapon, the God killing lightning Astrape, pierced Thor\u2019s chest. The God of white thunder kneeled down.</p><br/><p>Odin closed his eyes. He sensed Tae Ho\u2019s situation for the last time and he held his bitterness because his expectation became right once again.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho was running towards them. He endured the tens of thousands of lightning bolts and passed Odin, that had even overcome death. He charged towards Nyx when Thor collapsed.</p><br/><p>He was holding Gae Bolg.</p><br/><p>He was facing the God of death with the spear of death.</p><br/><p>Nyx extended her hand forward. The world started to stop Tae Ho. The overwhelming gravity grabbed his feet. The invisible wall didn\u2019t only surround Tae Ho but also pushed him back so that he wasn\u2019t able to breathe.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho swung Gae Bolg and endured the pressing power with a great amount of divine power. The spear of death destroyed the invisible wall.</p><br/><p>[Synchro rate: 98%]</p><br/><p>The incarnation of the World Dragon roared. He entrusted his body at the rage of the dragon.</p><br/><p>Nyx changed Astrape into a white spear and blocked Tae Ho\u2019s attack with that.</p><br/><p>Just looking at their techniques, Nyx wasn\u2019t Tae Ho\u2019s opponent. But right at this moment, what happened wasn\u2019t a competition of technique.</p><br/><p>The moment their spears clashed, Nyx poured pure strength into it. Gae Bolg shook greatly and Tae Ho got pushed back. Nyx then threw Astrape towards Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>The weapon of Zeus, the God killer lightning bolt.</p><br/><p>The thing that should have been pure white became black. It contained the power of the night and flew towards Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho saw that. He swung Gae Bolg once again to try to block it.</p><br/><p>But his arms didn\u2019t move. Death, that had soon caught up to him, was grabbing his arms.</p><br/><p>A dead end.</p><br/><p>\u2018Escape.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn said once again. At that moment Gae Bolg moved by its own. It left Tae Ho\u2019s hand and put itself in front of Tae Ho to block Astrape.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn.</p><br/><p>The soul that was contained in Gae Bolg used its last strength. He materialized his soul being determined to perish and wielded Gae Bolg.</p><br/><p>\u2018Go, I can only endure for a moment.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn didn\u2019t look back. He flashed and charged towards Nyx.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho knew.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn\u2019s words were right. He wasn\u2019t wrong. Preparing for the later times was the best option he had just like Odin had said.</p><br/><p>But Tae Ho didn\u2019t do that. He shook off death and advanced forward. He caught up with Cuchulainn and grabbed Gae Bolg instead of him.</p><br/><p>\u2018You crazy bastard!\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn cursed out but Tae Ho ignored him like usual. He couldn\u2019t escape. He couldn\u2019t give up on Cuchulainn. Including him, he couldn\u2019t ignore the deaths of everyone that were on Olympus.</p><br/><p>\u2018You fool.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn continued to curse him but ended up laughing in the end. He assisted Tae Ho with the strength he had been determining to use when he could perish.</p><br/><p>[Synchro rate: 99%]</p><br/><p>Tae Ho charged forward. He released his dark blue divinity and dyed Gae Bolg and then stabbed a deadly stab towards Nyx.</p><br/><p>Nyx tried to stop it with the first method she used.</p><br/><p>But it was different this time. Tae Ho tricked death. He destroyed the pressing of the world in an instant. He extended the spear of death forward that didn\u2019t weaken a bit even though it had destroyed hundreds of layers of an invisible barrier.</p><br/><p>The leisure in Nyx\u2019s face disappeared. Anxiety spread in her face for the first time.</p><br/><p>Kwagang!</p><br/><p>The entire mount of Olympus shook. The entire world turned silent and the loud sound broke the silence of the night.</p><br/><p>And it was only up to that point.</p><br/><p>Nyx blocked Tae Ho\u2019s attack. She also contained a dark blue divinity in Astrape and set off the power of death Tae Ho released.</p><br/><p>She stopped the last attack.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho panted while dropping his arms. He hadn\u2019t given up but his body didn\u2019t move.</p><br/><p>Nyx also breathed roughly. A smile spread in her stiff face. Experiencing fear of death for the first time since she was born was a really fresh thing. But there was no need to feel it again.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s end it now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nyx said and moved her hands. It was a small scaled attack because she also had her limits just like Odin had said.</p><br/><p>But it had enough power. A black lightning fell towards Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>He wouldn\u2019t be able to stop it now.</p><br/><p>It really was the end.</p><br/><p>But Tae Ho didn\u2019t close his eyes. He glared at the attack headed towards him until the end.</p><br/><p>And that\u2019s why he was able to see it.</p><br/><p>That the black lightning was splitting in two.</p><br/><p>That the Sword of the round table that appeared from space even though he hadn\u2019t called it blocked the black lightning.</p><br/><p>Nyx frowned. She gathered her divinity once again as if he was doing an annoying thing.</p><br/><p>But it was different for Cuchulainn.</p><br/><p>It was because he saw a completely different thing in the same scene.</p><br/><p>\u2018Arthur\u2026.Pendragon.\u2019</p><br/><p>The king of Camelot.</p><br/><p>His soul was wielding the Sword of the round table. He had stopped the lightning.</p><br/><p>And he turned to look at Tae Ho. He smiled towards the one that never gave up until the end and so obtained the rights at the most decisive moment. He didn\u2019t even bother about the second lightning bolt Nyx created and spoke as the king of Camelot.</p><br/><p>\u2018I recognize you.\u2019</p><br/><p>And when he said that.</p><br/><p>The sentence of Erin shone in the back of Tae Ho\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>Merlin raised his head. He was still grabbed by death but he was looking at a distant place. No one told him anything but he sensed what happened right now and the things that would happen from now on.</p><br/><p>Ahh.</p><br/><p>AHhhhh.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t say a word. He felt a lump in his throat and only tears flowed down.</p><br/><p>Merlin raised his staff. He took part in the last declaration the king of Camelot made as the magician of the king.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>The second lightning bolt also split in two. A white light tore the lightning and protected Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fa\u2026.ther?\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn said.</p><br/><p>The soul that was the white light itself smiled. It faced Nyx and said while extending his hand forward.</p><br/><p>\u2018I recognize you.\u2019</p><br/><p>The God of light Lugh.</p><br/><p>The leader of the Tuatha De Danann.</p><br/><p>One more light got added in the sentence of Erin.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>Scathach burst out of laughter. She had left the eternal sleep right in front of her eyes as she had been pressed down by death but she still emanated her last strength. She rose up from death and raised her spear.</p><br/><p>For the moment she thought that it would never come, she opened her mouth to protect the pledge she thought she would never have to protect.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t as a Valkyrie of Idun.</p><br/><p>Nor as the master of heroes.</p><br/><p>The queen of the land of darkness.</p><br/><p>She claimed as one of the members that made the sentence of Erin. She yelled with all her strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cI recognize you!\u201d</p><br/><p>She claimed and her voice certainly reached him.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t want to see you in that broken state.\u2019</p><br/><p>A beautiful woman stood next to king Arthur and the God of light Lugh. She was more beautiful than anyone but at the same time evil and strong.</p><br/><p>She was Cuchulainn\u2019s old enemy. She was the one that had held a deep hatred towards Cuchulainn but also had a deep affection towards him like love.</p><br/><p>She spoke to Cuchulainn. And looked at the one Cuchulainn recognized as his master.</p><br/><p>The daughter of the high king of Ireland, Medb.</p><br/><p>The queen that gathered the kingdoms, that had a feud between them, into one just to defeat Cuchulainn.</p><br/><p>She extended her hand towards Tae Ho. She spoke arrogantly just like she did in her previous life.</p><br/><p>\u2018I recognize you.\u2019</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>The ones that made the sentence of Erin rose in turn and claimed.</p><br/><p>The will of the ones that was asleep in the sentence started to state their thoughts.</p><br/><p>And at that moment Tae Ho could know.</p><br/><p>What their claim meant.</p><br/><p>Why did they stand up and yell.</p><br/><p>The destroyed world Erin didn\u2019t have a master currently.</p><br/><p>The groups split in several beings were holding the power of the master in parts.</p><br/><p>And right at this moment.</p><br/><p>The ones holding the power of the master gathered their will for the first time since Erin got created. They selected the one they would serve as their king and the one that would inherit Erin.</p><br/><p>[Master of Erin]</p><br/><p>The sentence of Erin released a different strength from before and at the same time another power arose from Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>Master of Asgard.</p><br/><p>The one that protects Asgard.</p><br/><p>The sentence of Erin shone in his right hand.</p><br/><p>And the new sentence of Asgard that got created appeared in his left hand.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho raised his head.</p><br/><p>He released the power he didn\u2019t have until now as he became the master of two worlds. He made his dark blue divinity explode!</p><br/><p>The death, that was taking place in the mount of Olympus, got driven away in an instant and Nyx\u2019s face stiffened once more.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s useless. Nothing will change.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nyx said. Her voice didn\u2019t have leisure compared to before but her words weren\u2019t wrong.</p><br/><p>The absolute superiority. Even if the master of two worlds gathered that power in one body he wouldn\u2019t be able to beat the world itself.</p><br/><p>In addition this world was Olympus. It wasn\u2019t Asgard or Erin.</p><br/><p>\u201cI also know that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho said that. He could know that as he was none other than the one that became the master of two worlds. He rather felt more keenly the differences in their power.</p><br/><p>It was like Odin had first thought. He wouldn\u2019t be able to beat Nyx simply by having a contest of strength. Tearing apart the connection between the primeval Gods and putting an end to the dark world was the only method.</p><br/><p>Master.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha said with a low voice. Nidhogg spoke while crying. Rolo breathed roughly and raised his head and Drakon Ismenios smiled.</p><br/><p>\u2018My warrior Tae Ho.\u2019</p><br/><p>Idun and Heda.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho extended his hand and called the Sword of the round table with his sentence of the Milesian. He faced Nyx, that was gathering strength to press him down in an instant, and grabbed the sword.</p><br/><p>The soul of king Arthur fell asleep.</p><br/><p>The soul of Medb scattered.</p><br/><p>The souls of the ones that had made the sentence of Erin and were protecting it faced their real eternal slumber.</p><br/><p>And he said.

Lee Tae Ho was looking at his corpse that was on the floor and on the screen of the monitor with a stupid face, and at the chairman that was trying to say whatever he could, alternatingly.</p><br/><p>The hall was filled with silence. There were thousands of spectators that had gathered to watch the finals, but there was no one that raised their voice.</p><br/><p>Because it was shocking to that extent.</p><br/><p>However, the silence didn\u2019t last long. Someone started screaming and soon the hall started to get filled with all sorts of voices. There were some that sobbed, and some that called their acquaintances and yelled. There were even some that laughed as if the situation was fun.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck. Ah, fuck.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho cursed. The staff was carrying his corpse on a stretcher.</p><br/><p>\u201cI died while playing a game?\u201d</p><br/><p>He turned to look at the monitor. Tae Ho\u2019s other self, the dragon knight Kalsted, was on the floor collapsed and was making a grievous expression.</p><br/><p>What will happen now?</p><br/><p>He got scared.</p><br/><p>Will he remain as a soul for eternity?</p><br/><p>Perhaps that may be better than getting dragged to hell and having his soul extinguished. No, was that really the case? He had to stay in this place and roam for eternity.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know. He couldn\u2019t know anything.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho looked at his surroundings. He couldn\u2019t see any angels nor devils, to say nothing of grim reapers. He didn\u2019t have a religion. Was it because of that?</p><br/><p>Tae Ho breathed roughly. He had died and became a ghost, but he still breathed roughly. He even felt like cold sweat was dripping.</p><br/><p>\u201cSoul of a warrior that died after a glorious battle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Right then, a voice was heard. As he raised his head, he could see that the ceiling of his personal booth was shining. A beautiful woman appeared from between that light.</p><br/><p>\u2018A, angel?!\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho let out a sigh of relief when he realized that he wouldn\u2019t be going to hell. Actually, he had made a donation recently, so perhaps that was the reason.</p><br/><p>But this angel was a bit strange. He couldn\u2019t see the white wings nor the halo. Now that he took a better look, she was wearing armor and even had a sword at her waist.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, a Valkyrie?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho spoke unconsciously and the beautiful woman with long black hair extended her hand to him while smiling.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go exalted warrior.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho grabbed her hand without knowing and at that moment, the world turned upside down.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrave warriors! Welcome to Valhalla, where the warriors of the Gods gather!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cValhalla! Valhalla! Valhalla!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Odin!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThor!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho\u2019s eyes became round. The people lined up in front of the huge arched door were crying out enthusiastically.</p><br/><p>But most of them seemed weird. No, precisely speaking it was their outfit. Everyone had huge bodies and were wearing leather clothes or armor. And the things they were holding were mostly axes or swords.</p><br/><p>He could see beautiful ladies in between them, but they were also wearing armor and helmet.</p><br/><p>They also had swords at their waists.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are a lot of great warriors gathered here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho got surprised at the voice that was heard right next to him and turned to look at the source. The Valkyrie he saw at the game booth was looking at the people lined up while smiling brightly.</p><br/><p>Valhalla.</p><br/><p>Valkyrie.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho opened his eyes roundly. It was because something struck his head.</p><br/><p>Valhalla. The place that could be called heaven in the north European mythology. A banquet where warriors that died in glorious battles gathered!</p><br/><p>\u201cWa, wait! Something is wrong! I\u2019m a pro gamer!\u201d</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t a warrior. In addition, he didn\u2019t even remember dying in the middle of a glorious battle.</p><br/><p>However, the Valkyrie just tilted her head at Tae Ho\u2019s protest.</p><br/><p>\u201cProgay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPro-gamer!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that job?\u201d</p><br/><p>The question came from a warrior that was close to Tae Ho. It was a huge man whose beard reached his chest, and his muscles really were amazing.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho flinched at the question of this man, whom you would try not to make eye contact with when you met him on the streets and said with a softened voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, just like the name implies, it\u2019s a job that involves playing games.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGame? Oh! You mean battles!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBattle!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDuel!\u201d</p><br/><p>The ones nearby nodded and smiled as if they finally understood.</p><br/><p>No, what part of that did you understand!</p><br/><p>Tae Ho quickly tried to ease the misunderstanding but his mouth didn\u2019t seem to open that easily. In addition, there was one person next to him that poured fuel to the fire.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis person was a champion! And one that won all of the battles in which he participated at that!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was the Valkyrie. Her smile was filled with proudness as if the warrior she had brought was the best.</p><br/><p>\u201cChampion!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChampion!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKing of battles!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are quite amazing compared to how you look!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you are hiding those amazing skills huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy blood is boiling! I want to battle you once!\u201d</p><br/><p>The bear-like men smiled viciously and gathered up. It felt like the surrounding temperature was rising by 3 degrees.</p><br/><p>\u2018No, fuck! This isn\u2019t it! How do you interpret pro gamer as a king of battles!\u2019</p><br/><p>However, the Valkyrie that didn\u2019t seem to know how Tae Ho was feeling, smiled brightly and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cExalted warrior, welcome you to Valhalla!\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWelcome!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWelcome!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cValhalla!\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh! Odin!\u201d</p><br/><p>One warrior approached Tae Ho and smiled after placing his hand on his shoulder. It didn\u2019t seem like an arm of a person but of an elephant.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, warrior. We are going to Valhalla together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to listen to your story!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe door is opening!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOhh! Valhalla!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho wanted to refute somehow, but it was a meaningless thing. When Tae Ho barely managed to say something, all of the soldiers were looking at the huge door.</p><br/><p>Valhalla.</p><br/><p>The arena where the souls of the warriors of the gods stay and at the same time a banquet!</p><br/><p>That door opened up.</p><br/><p>&lt; Prologue &gt; End</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" disabled=\"\" id=\"prev_chap\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/valhalla-saga-chapter-1\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 1\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"95180\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

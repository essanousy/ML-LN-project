However, she was someone that had lived far longer than Heda.</p><br/><p>She, who was special even among the three sisters, was the youngest and was in charge of the future among the past, present and future. Untying the knots of fat that Verdandi and Uld worked hard to make was her role.</p><br/><p>Skuld was also at the same time a Valkyrie. Because of that, she wore feather decorations like Heda, Rasgrid or the other Valkyries and armor that covered her arms, chest and shoulders.</p><br/><p>As the Valkyries of Valhalla were all mature or beautiful women, the girlish-looking Valkyrie was really eye catching. But marvelously enough, there was no one who could see Skuld standing on the wooden dock. It was because of the future attribute she possessed.</p><br/><p>Compared to the past or present, the future, which was said to be covered in mist, was something not just anyone could see through.</p><br/><p>Heda hurriedly stood up. Then Skuld waved her long hair, which reached her waist, and grabbed Heda\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cShall we walk for a moment? That\u2019s fine, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>The one who had trained Heda as a Valkyrie was none other than Skuld. In Heda\u2019s position, she was meeting her teacher for the first in a really long while.</p><br/><p>Although they had met a few times after that day, this was the first time they had spoken alone since then. However, even if that hadn\u2019t been the case, Heda and Skuld didn\u2019t bring out a serious topic. They only asked trivial things like how they have been, the weather, etc.</p><br/><p>After walking around the hall, Skuld finally said her farewell.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really good, meeting in a long while. Let\u2019s meet again at another opportunity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes Skuld-nim. I also had a good time.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Heda hit her chest as if expressing her manners, Skuld opened her two arms widely. Heda understood the meaning behind that and then embraced Skuld while wearing a small smile.</p><br/><p>The one that was embraced was Heda but because of the difference in height, it seemed as if Skuld was the one being embraced. But Skuld still caressed Heda\u2019s head and then whispered in her ear.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd this is a secret, but you should have some determination.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDetermination?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou will know in about two days.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Skuld laughed playfully, Heda made an uneasy face but then also smiled brightly. In the first place, there was no way Skuld would laugh and tell her this if it was something serious.</p><br/><p>The wooden boat departed from the dock of Idun\u2019s legion. Skuld, who was seeing off Heda with a valiant face, could feel that much time had passed. Before that happened on that day, the ship of Idun\u2019s legion wasn\u2019t that small. They had a big ship, just like the other legions.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the end I wasn\u2019t able to say it.\u201d Skuld mumbled while waving her hand at Heda. The reason she had come to meet Heda wasn\u2019t to share her thoughts. Although she had warned her about a small thing, that really was closer to a prank.</p><br/><p>After Ragnarok had started, Skuld and her other sisters had to remain in their seats in order to respond to Odin\u2019s requests. But the reason why she had still come out like this was because of a strong impulse.</p><br/><p>The thread of fate was touching Idun\u2019s legion.</p><br/><p>The three sisters didn\u2019t tie personal fates together. What they did tie was the fate of the world.</p><br/><p>There had also been a time in the past when the thread of fate had touched Idun\u2019s legion. And that day had come. It would be the most miserable day for Heda.</p><br/><p>But still, saying that the thread of fate had touched somewhere didn\u2019t always mean something negative. It merely meant that it was related to the fate of the world.</p><br/><p>Because of that, rather than being a misfortune, it could also be a great one.</p><br/><p>Heda wasn\u2019t visible anymore because of the fog that was there. However, Skuld still remained in the same place and looked at the place she had left from.</p><br/><p>Although she was in charge of the future, she couldn\u2019t see through it clearly. There were also unknown territories in the future for her.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let blessings accompany you.\u2019</p><br/><p>Skuld gave her a small blessing and slowly turned around.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>\u201cSkuld-nim\u2019s words were right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Two days later, Heda stood on the wooden dock of Idun\u2019s legion while crossing her arms and with sharp eyes. Next to her were Rolo and the female gryphons, lying on their stomachs and looking at them.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeda!\u201d</p><br/><p>She hadn\u2019t even gone to bring him back but Tae Ho had appeared in a big, outstanding ship which was comparable to the ones in the other legions with a bright smile. However, the things inside the ship were a bit strange.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is the home I will be staying at? As I\u2019m a sea serpent, I prefer the sea rather than a lake or river.\u2019 (Speaking politely)</p><br/><p>A sea serpent that was so big it made one wonder how the ship could sail was on top of it, and inside of it there was a woman so beautiful even Heda was surprised.</p><br/><p>The woman, who had abundant black hair, was covered by the leather of a black beast and she emanated a really weak aura. It was because of her white face, which was close to being pale and her two eyes, which were so deep it made one think of an abyss.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe returned after a long while and only brought a lot of women.\u201d Ragnar said righteously and Heda nodded unconsciously. Even Siri, who could now be described as an honorary member of Idun\u2019s legion, was wearing a bitter smile and that made Heda feel uneasy.</p><br/><p>However she ended up smiling. It was because Tae Ho\u2019s healthy appearance made her feel at ease.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho jumped down from the ship and made the sea serpent get in the lake and then waved towards the beautiful woman. Then the small boat that the woman was in moved on its own and reached the dock.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s Scathach-nim, the Queen of the Land of Darkness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho hurriedly presented Scathach. Then the faces of Ragnar and Heda changed. Ragnar put on the same dignified face he wore in front of the warriors of Valhalla and then hit his chest twice and expressed his manners.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to be able to meet the beautiful and wise queen of the Land of Darkness. I\u2019m Ragnar Lodbrok.\u201d</p><br/><p>The face of Scathach didn\u2019t change that greatly, because she had already known that Ragnar was in that place. Then she placed her right hand on her left shoulder and bowed slightly. It was the etiquette of the Land of Darkness.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to be able to meet the King of the exalted Vikings. I\u2019m Scathach.\u201d</p><br/><p>She, who treated even Gandur inhospitably, treated Ragnar politely. As Ragnar also treated everyone excluding Gods inhospitably, it could be said that it was an honorable treatment between Kings.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Heda, the Valkyrie of Idun\u2019s legion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda also hit her chest and expressed her manners. And then Scathach blinked a few times and started to laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have heard a lot about you. Nice to meet you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just what did she hear about her? And why was she laughing?</p><br/><p>There was a possibility that it didn\u2019t mean anything but she started to worry about that. No, it was obvious to do so.</p><br/><p>When Heda turned to look at Tae Ho, he pointed at Adenmaha, seemingly as if he didn\u2019t know how Heda was feeling.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeda, Ragnar. This is Adenmaha. She\u2019s a sea serpent from Erin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Nice to meet you.\u2019 (Politely)</p><br/><p>Adenmaha lowered her neck to be at the same height as everyone. It seemed as if it was Adenmaha\u2019s way of showing her sincerity.</p><br/><p>It seemed as if that worked well, as Heda\u2019s expression became softer. Ragnar also seemed to find her cute.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe names of Rolo\u2019s wives, who are over there, are Porsche and Benz.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho pointed at Rolo and his wives, who were looking at her with cautious eyes. Adenmaha snorted at their gazes and then said with an offensive voice, \u2018Their names are a bit weird.\u2019 (Politely)</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t know about Rolo but the names of the other two were certainly weird.</p><br/><p>But Tae Ho paid no attention to that and said, \u201cThey are your comrades, so get along well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Hm.\u2019</p><br/><p>She was a bit displeased to be treated as being the same rank with beasts that couldn\u2019t speak properly but she nodded for now. Obeying the words of her master was her geas.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt has become a complete zoo. What is next, a lion or an elephant?\u201d Ragnar mumbled, as if it was absurd. Heda got a hold of herself and then spoke towards Scathach.</p><br/><p>\u201cScathach-nim. Let\u2019s go inside. Sorry Adenmaha, but can you stay there for a bit? I will give you a place to rest soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Valkyrie of a legion was also a landlady. She couldn\u2019t keep a guest waiting forever.</p><br/><p>\u201cOver here.\u201d Ragnar escorted Scathach. Heda glared at Tae Ho for a moment and then hurried her steps.</p><br/><p>\u2018What can I say? Her eyes are those of a wife that\u2019s glaring at her husband for having brought his friends to his house without giving advice or prior notice.\u2019</p><br/><p>How much time had passed after Cu Chulainn had left that life metaphor? As Ragnar and Scathach started to speak between them, Heda treated her with snacks and then left the house and approached Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did it turn out like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps it was because of Cu Chulainn\u2019s metaphor, but Heda seemed scarier than usual. No, her eyes were actually scary.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, um\u2026\u201d Tae Ho explained the things that had happened two days before very briefly. Heda, who had finished listening to everything, nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it really was unavoidable. And looking at the big picture was a gain for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Scathach was Erin\u2019s celebrity. In addition, just as Gandur desired her, she was an outstanding teacher. If she chose to stay in Idun\u2019s legion among the several legions, then it wouldn\u2019t only help the reputation of the legion, but it would also be a great help for Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>In addition, didn\u2019t they obtain a flying pirate ship and the magic boat, Sgaba Tune?</p><br/><p>However, the only thing she was worried about was that they had gotten involved with the Tyrant Bress, because his obstination and stubbornness was so great, it was even famous in Asgard. Although he was still their enemy, it wasn\u2019t that good to think about it.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho smiled brightly, oblivious to Heda\u2019s worry and then pointed at the pocket he was carrying at his waist.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd I also obtained this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA magic tool from Erin?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho hurriedly took out a rock from a pocket and gave it to Heda.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s something called a Summoning Rock, and you are able to summon a subject you have made a contract with. The farther the distance, the more magic power is spent, and the summoning time is also short, but it\u2019s useful in many ways, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a story that made one nod on its own. Because Tae Ho had gotten stronger when he rode on something, it made sense that he had brought Adenmaha to Idun\u2019s legion.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, then you don\u2019t need to ride on Siri or the other Valkyries anymore, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 Probably?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Heda asked with a gentle voice, Tae Ho answered with a bewildered voice. Then, the silent Cu Chulainn raised his voice.</p><br/><p>\u2018That\u2019s impossible. Impossible. He even rode on Gandur in this expedition. He was in a really good mood, saying that he added one more trophy to his shelf.\u2019</p><br/><p>Even though they were inside of Idun\u2019s legion,which amplified one\u2019s power, he was certain that he was concealing the fact that he could emit his voice outside of Gae Bolg.</p><br/><p>\u201cWh, when did I!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho hurriedly denied the fact but his voice trembled, because he did feel a bit proud, just as a collector did, when he gathered the blessings of the Valkyries. Using game terms, it felt as if he was doing a challenge.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm. So you did that. You rode on a Valkyrie again. You raised your name of the warrior that rode on a Valkyrie once again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda spoke with a voice that had no intonation. When Tae Ho flinched, she started to laugh like a child.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a joke, a joke. I\u2019m happy with you having returned safely.\u201d</p><br/><p>His opponent was an underling of the Tyrant Bress. Tae Ho, who had faced a strong opponent, just did his best as always.</p><br/><p>Heda grabbed Tae Ho\u2019s hands gently and then closed the distance to him. Then, Tae Ho also lowered his body towards Heda. It was to receive the blessing he was now accustomed to.</p><br/><p>Heda had changed the place in which she gave her blessing to him when Cu Chulainn had started to bless Tae Ho on his forehead.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho had recently gotten taller, maybe because the sync rate had increased, since Heda had to stand on her toes to bless him. But it was when she was about to place her lips on his cheek that it happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda\u2019s nose moved. She smelled the scent of an unfamiliar woman \u2013 no, a woman she had seen once, close to his lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho?\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda asked and Tae Ho just rolled his eyes.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>The lands that were directly connected to the mortal world, Midgard, were only two.</p><br/><p>The land of Gods, Asgard, and the land of the dead, Niflheim.</p><br/><p>But of course that was only a normal connector. If you wanted to invade it you could always open a door connecting to Midgard forcefully just like what was done in Erin.</p><br/><p>But that couldn\u2019t happen. Because it would make a big noise. Everyone would be aware of what had happened.</p><br/><p>Loki, the God of fire and lies, stood in Asgard. He crossed the land he couldn\u2019t return to since the Great War and walked towards the rainbow stairs, Bifrost.</p><br/><p>Loki, that was hidden in the shadow of the night, walked towards Asgard\u2019s castle. He reached the fortress that Heimdal was guarding by hiding his existence with skills that were so impressive even the God of magic, Freya got amazed at.</p><br/><p>The sincere Heimdal couldn\u2019t see Loki. The darkness that completely filled the night made even the rainbow stairs to turn dark. Because of that even if someone used Bifrost in the deep night, you wouldn\u2019t be able to notice the existence of a human in it.</p><br/><p>Loki walked towards Midgard. He was holding several fragments of Garmr\u2019s soul.</p><br/><p>\u201cOdin.\u201d</p><br/><p>And Thor.</p><br/><p>Loki put a faint smile after calling the names of the ones he grieved. He gulped cold air above the land of Midgard that he had reached.</p><br/><p>He felt like he could feel the gaze of the giant of night, Avalt.</p><br/><p>But what if he was watching him? Loki hid himself once again in the curtain of darkness and walked. He scattered Garmr\u2019s soul fragments to create a big ruckus.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet everything happen as the king wishes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loki smiled like a theatre actor and turned around.</p><br/><p>And the next morning.</p><br/><p>The planned chaos started to burn down Midgard.</p><br/><p>&lt; Scathach (2) &gt; End</p><hr/><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/>\n</div>"}

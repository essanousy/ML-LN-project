Lightning and gale danced along the path of the red meteor and the sound of thunder shook the world.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho opened his eyes sharply while lowering his posture on Rolo\u2019s neck. He saw the figure of the three people with his strengthened \u2018eyes of the dragon\u2019.</p><br/><p>The two men looking at his side.</p><br/><p>The woman that was getting held by her hair and also looking at him.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho transmitted his thoughts to Rolo with his saga and transmitted his strategy to Bracky and Siri with mystical magic.</p><br/><p>Phobos yelled something and Deimos pulled on Athena\u2019s hair roughly.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s go.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho said. Rolo didn\u2019t drop to the ground. He kept flying while maintaining the speed and Siri hung on Bracky\u2019s back. Tae Ho and Bracky stood up at the same time.</p><br/><p>Kwagagang!</p><br/><p>Thunder fell. Deimos and Phobos were bewildered at the red dragon passing by over their heads.</p><br/><p>And it was the same for Athena. Her blue eyes shining with hope started to have bewilderment appear in them.</p><br/><p>Kwagang!</p><br/><p>Thunder shook once again. Lightning fell down next to Deimos and Phobos.</p><br/><p>[Saga: His entrance is accompanied with lightning]</p><br/><p>When Bracky stood up from Rolo\u2019s back, he got pushed by the gale naturally. But he didn\u2019t resist it and rather entrusted his body to the flow. He grabbed Tae Ho with one arm and raised his hammer.</p><br/><p>The new saga he obtained in the battle against the giant kings.</p><br/><p>Bracky transformed into lightning and descended in the ground.</p><br/><p>Kwagagang!</p><br/><p>Loud explosions were heard in consecution. Deimos and Phobos stepped back at the lightning that flashed right in front of their eyes and Tae Ho and Bracky charged towards the two of them after landing down.</p><br/><p>[Saga: Equipment of the dragon knight]</p><br/><p>A sharp dagger fired from Tae Ho\u2019s hands like an arrow. The dagger that was controlled with the sentence of the Milesian wasn\u2019t aiming for Deimos. It cut Athena\u2019s long and black hair that Deimos was grabbing.</p><br/><p>Athena fell on her butt. Deimos also lost balance and staggered.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho gripped the air and took out a weapon to deal with giants instead of the sword or spear he was accustomed to.</p><br/><p>Giant\u2019s hammer.</p><br/><p>It was a weapon that had the shape of its simple name. It was a huge hammer which handle was 2 meters long and the head of the hammer was the upper body of a human.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho rang and swung his hammer and Deimos raised his spear hurriedly and made an invisible wall with his divine power. The hammer hit the wall and Deimos fell back greatly.</p><br/><p>They would separate Deimos and Athena. Tae Ho dropped his hammer that had accomplished its task. He charged forward and yelled at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u201cAdenmaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>She, to whom he could believe in and entrust anything wherever and whenever.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t explain anything. It was an irresponsible summon but it was enough.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha was summoned in a sitting position and embraced Athena immediately. She sensed her surroundings and then spread a barrier with her mystical magic and put on a curling stance.</p><br/><p>Bracky hit Phobos with his hammer. Phobos also fell back like Deimos and created some distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha said. She used healing magic on Athena and looked at the back of the man she hated.</p><br/><p>It was always like this. He called her as a throwing card.</p><br/><p>But she knew that he was like this because he believed in her and also knew that he would never call her in a dangerous situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy master is here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha was certain. Athena let out a sigh in her embrace and was relieved. It wasn\u2019t because reinforcements had arrived. The strong belief in Adenmaha\u2019s voice calmed her mind.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A loud explosion bursted out from the right. It was a sound created by the clash of Bracky\u2019s hammer and Phobos\u2019 axe.</p><br/><p>No one receded. The shock swept their surroundings and the muscles of the two swelled up greatly.</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard!\u201d</p><br/><p>Phobos yelled. He crossed his axe with Bracky\u2019s hammer and crushed the air. Phobos\u2019 divine power tore the ground and the lightning generated from Bracky\u2019s hammer swept the ground.</p><br/><p>Phobos became enraged. He swung his axe towards Bracky, who was obstructing his joyful time and even faced him, and yelled.</p><br/><p>\u201cKneel! I\u2019m a son of a God!\u201d</p><br/><p>Phobos\u2019 divine power exploded. Bracky also did the same instead of dodging.</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Saga: Son of a God]</p><br/><p>The blood of a God started to flow in Bracky\u2019s veins. His already big body started to become bigger and lightning started to wave following his arms.</p><br/><p>Phobos\u2019 and Bracky\u2019s divine power clashed and dispersed. Phobos was bewildered at Bracky\u2019s answer and asked with a surprised expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother?\u201d</p><br/><p>Was he one of the several children of his father Ares?</p><br/><p>Bracky was bewildered at the really weird question but fortunately he wasn\u2019t alone.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are at the same level.\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri said in a low voice and moved. She, who was hanging on Bracky\u2019s back, leapt above Phobos\u2019 head and fired arrows in consecution.</p><br/><p>[Saga: Wolf Goddess]</p><br/><p>Ullr\u2019s divine power was behind the arrows of light Siri fired. Ullr\u2019s blood started to flow in her now that she had transformed into a wolf Goddess that had golden fur.</p><br/><p>Kwagagak!</p><br/><p>The arrows of light struck Phobos\u2019 shoulder and arm. They couldn\u2019t inflict significant damage because they were weakened by Phobos\u2019 rough divine power, but it was enough.</p><br/><p>Bracky swung his hammer once again. Siri lowered her posture as soon as she landed and fired arrows that were like slithering snakes and the arrows of light pierced Phobos\u2019 ankle as he was blocking Bracky\u2019s hammer and then yelled in pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cDeimos!\u201d</p><br/><p>Phobos requested help from his brother. Deimos heard his request but he couldn\u2019t react. He was already full with the enemy in front of him.</p><br/><p>Kalsted\u2019s style.</p><br/><p>Lightning slash.</p><br/><p>Two storms were created in Tae Ho\u2019s hands. This double attack executed by Gallatin and Arondight was really fast and sharp.</p><br/><p>Deimos was confident in his spearmanship. He was certain that his skills were the best among the many children of Ares.</p><br/><p>And his thoughts weren\u2019t wrong. His spearmanship was certainly amazing.</p><br/><p>But he didn\u2019t have a good opponent.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho had the most outstanding spearman of all of Erin, Asgard and even Olympus at his side. He had Scathach\u2019s style techniques that he trained with that person.</p><br/><p>Scathach\u2019s techniques read Deimos\u2019 flow.</p><br/><p>The \u2018eyes of the dragon\u2019 grasped the movement of divine power.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho didn\u2019t push away Deimos\u2019 spear roughly. He received it. They pulled and pushed softly as if dancing together.</p><br/><p>The blade of Arondight slipped off from Deimos\u2019 spear. He parried it lightly and turned the tip of the spear to a weird direction.</p><br/><p>Deimos detonated his divine power now that his hands and feet were tied up. He tried to push away Tae Ho for a moment.</p><br/><p>But Tae Ho had already read his intention as he possessed the \u2018eyes of the dragon\u2019. He swung Gallatin that contained a sharp divine power the moment Deimos bursted his own divine power.</p><br/><p>He cut down the explosion and took a step from the remnants.</p><br/><p>\u201cDeimos!\u201d</p><br/><p>Phobos yelled once again. It wasn\u2019t because he was worried about Deimos, whohad allowed an attack of Tae Ho to reach him and vomited blood because of that.</p><br/><p>Phobos couldn\u2019t even see Deimos. He couldn\u2019t move his eyes off of Siri and Bracky who were moving like one person as if they had become flowing water.</p><br/><p>If he had fought only against one of them he wouldn\u2019t be suffering like this. He would have already cut them down in two pieces.</p><br/><p>But the two of them were together and so released power a few times greater than their own.</p><br/><p>Phobos used his authority. He tried to plant fear to the enemies in front of him as the God of fear.</p><br/><p>\u201cEvil eyes!\u201d</p><br/><p>But it didn\u2019t work. Bracky didn\u2019t know fear. He ignored Phobos\u2019 fear with his strong belief towards Thor.</p><br/><p>It was a bit different for Siri. Fear should have originally worked on her. It was because fear that she hid deep in her heart existed, compared to Bracky who had transcended fear.</p><br/><p>But she also overcame Phobos\u2019 fear. Bracky\u2019s existence made that possible. She didn\u2019t want to admit it but she didn\u2019t fear anything when she was with Bracky.</p><br/><p>Siri flushed even though they were in the middle of a battle. Fortunately, Bracky wasn\u2019t able to see that. He laughed and swung his hammer again.</p><br/><p>Kwagagang!</p><br/><p>Lightning struck and it hit Phobos\u2019 chest. Siri\u2019s sharp leg chip made Phobos fall down.</p><br/><p>\u201cDeimos!\u201d</p><br/><p>Phobos\u2019 scream got cut off. Bracky\u2019s hammer silenced him.</p><br/><p>Deimos screamed soundlessly.</p><br/><p>He allowed some attacks to hit him. He did avoid a lethal injury but he couldn\u2019t help about his functions lowering.</p><br/><p>Deimos employed his authority at the end of the hesitation. He, the God of defeat, could sense defeat.</p><br/><p>There was nothing absolute in victory. Everyone had probabilities to be defeated no matter if it was big or small. That\u2019s why he would read that probability. He would aim for it obstinately and increase the probabilities of defeat.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a bad thought but Deimos\u2019 face contorted. He realized why he had hesitated in employing his authority.</p><br/><p>The smell of defeat was too dense. It wasn\u2019t a scent that came from the enemy but from himself. It was so nasty he couldn\u2019t smell anything else.</p><br/><p>No, that wasn\u2019t all.</p><br/><p>The smell of defeat almost couldn\u2019t be sensed from the enemy. It was just like facing an embodiment of victory.</p><br/><p>The hopeless defeat that was predicted in front of his eyes.</p><br/><p>His authority didn\u2019t open a door to victory but made him turn his heart.</p><br/><p>Deimos\u2019 limbs contorted even more. Tae Ho didn\u2019t miss Deimos\u2019 mistake of having fallen in his own trap. He swung Gallatin and Arondight roughly with a bit of a time difference.</p><br/><p>Deimos dropped his spear in the end and at the same time Tae Ho also dropped Gallatin and Arondight. But what he did was different to Deimos. When Tae Ho clenched his fists with his free hands, the fake Heda and fake Scathach that appeared like illusions grabbed Gallatin and Arondight. They released the aura of their swords and destroyed Deimos\u2019 defenses.</p><br/><p>The invisible barrier that was made with divine power crumbled down. Tae Ho passed the breaking pieces and closed the distance.</p><br/><p>He hit Deimos\u2019 throat. He then punched his side and then hit his collarbone with his right hand and broke his posture.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a simple physical attack. Idun\u2019s golden divine power and Tae Ho\u2019s own dark and blue divine power was held in each of his attacks.</p><br/><p>Deimos realized one fact while he was getting hit mercilessly.</p><br/><p>The golden divine power was much stronger than the dark blue divine power.</p><br/><p>But the dark blue divine power was dangerous. It was still small and weak but it contained power that the golden divine power didn\u2019t have. Deimos couldn\u2019t help but be shocked when he realized the identity of that strength.</p><br/><p>He had to tell this to his father Ares. Even if his own defeat was inevitable, he had to stop the defeat of his father Ares.</p><br/><p>Deimos squeezed out the last of his divine power. He tried to send a last call to his father Ares just like Athena did.</p><br/><p>But Tae Ho didn\u2019t allow for that.</p><br/><p>He stabbed Caliburn in Deimos\u2019 chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>Deimos vomited blood. Tae Ho poured Idun\u2019s divine power in the blade of Caliburn. He then released the Glory of Erin to destroy Deimos\u2019 divinity itself.</p><br/><p>The fairy god sword Excalibur.</p><br/><p>The shiny golden light destroyed Deimos\u2019 divine power. It erased it from the world.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho dropped his sword. He looked at Siri and Bracky instead of looking down at Deimos becoming ash and disappearing. Thor\u2019s and Ullr\u2019s divine powers were destroying Phobos\u2019 divine power.</p><br/><p>[You have accomplished your quest.]</p><br/><p>[Your prestige has become higher.]</p><br/><p>[Athena is really grateful towards you.]</p><br/><p>[Receive the promised reward from Athena-nim.]</p><br/><p>[You have defeated the God of defeat Deimos.]</p><br/><p>[You have become closer to the title \u2018the one that killed a God.]</p><br/><p>The runes that came out of Deimos got sucked by Tae Ho\u2019s palm. His divinity grew one more step and took a new shape.</p><br/><p>And one more thing was added to this.</p><br/><p>[Synchro rate: 85%]</p><br/><p>The synchro rate had not increased in a really long while.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho realized something at that moment.</p><br/><p>That a great change would occur when the synchro rate reached 90%.</p><br/><p>He could somewhat guess what the change would be. It was because Tae Ho knew about Kalsted more than anyone in the world.</p><br/><p>\u2018You fight quite well now.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn spoke jokingly and thanks to that Tae Ho could drop his tension and nervousness even after having won.</p><br/><p>It seemed that the battle against Phobos was quite a fierce one that Bracky had wounds generated by Phobos\u2019 axe stamping and slashing his body and he let out a victory cry. Siri looked at him from a side and smiled faintly.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha called out to Tae Ho. Athena was in her embrace.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho fixed his posture in front of Athena. Siri hit the back of the still excited Bracky to make him get a hold of himself and made him stand next to Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cWarriors of Valhalla. Thank you for having saved me. I am the Goddess of warfare Athena.\u201d</p><br/><p>Athena said. She, who hadn\u2019t shed a single tear while being hit mercilessly by Deimos and Phobos, started to redden her eyes.</p><br/><p>Gratefulness, relief, hope, sadness.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho expressed etiquette in front of her, who was experiencing all sorts of emotions. He revealed that he was a warrior of Idun and then introduced Bracky, Siri and Adenmaha in that order.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Asgard and the nine realms.\u201d</p><br/><p>He added that at the last part. It was a simple greeting but the will of Asgard was contained in it.</p><br/><p>Asgard won\u2019t let Olympus fade away.</p><br/><p>Athens was erased from the world.</p><br/><p>Even Poseidon, who possessed strength comparable to Zeus, had turned into a being wanting to destroy the world.</p><br/><p>The situation was really hopeless.</p><br/><p>But Athena answered the rescue of Asgard with a smile. She expressed etiquette with her uncomfortable body.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Asgard and the nine realms.\u201d</p><br/><p>Athena placed her hand on her chest and Bracky laughed refreshingly. Siri put a soft smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was right, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>That it would all be fine as long as her master had arrived.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha said in a low voice while looking at Tae Ho with shining eyes and Athena nodded.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 51 \u2013 Clash (5) &gt; End</p><hr/><br/>\n</div>"}

Blood flowed endlessly through its fingers. The pain caused by the wound was too unfamiliar.</p><br/><p>It was something he wouldn\u2019t forget.</p><br/><p>Everyone in this place was inferior ranked warriors. It wasn\u2019t something it had heard, but Makus itself had confirmed it.</p><br/><p>It had observed them entering the Mollo family from a far place. And he ascertained it by fighting them.</p><br/><p>The runes they had accumulated were all at the inferior ranked level. There were no intermediate ranked warriors here.</p><br/><p>But it was certainly the strength of a God. The thing that had ripped open the blessing of the Giant, and the thing that had pressed down the regeneration right.</p><br/><p>In addition, the power of a God was unfamiliar to it. It was a strength he hadn\u2019t experienced on the battlefield until now.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t only Makus, but Siri also got shocked. However, it was different to Makus\u2019s shock. There was delight in Siri\u2019s shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho said. That sentence cut down everyone\u2019s thoughts. The regenerator Makus flinched, and Siri and the warriors of Valhalla knew what they had to do. They all started to pour down attacks starting from Rolph.</p><br/><p>Arrows poured down. It still didn\u2019t work. However, Makus couldn\u2019t ignore them anymore with the leisure it had previously.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s eyes focused on Tae Ho. Tae Ho faced that Makus and let out a long breath. He thought while maintaining a calm expression.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fuck.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was hard. Maintaining the strength of a God wasn\u2019t an ordinary thing. He thought he knew why Heda had told him not to use it if possible.</p><br/><p>He felt like his magic power, stamina and concentration were being drained quickly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s fight wisely.\u2019</p><br/><p>Fighting while maintaining the strength of the God was a stupid thing to do. There was a high probability of him collapsing before the monster if he did that.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho observed Makus. He remembered the moment Runefang ripped its abdomen.</p><br/><p>The strength of the God ripped open the force that was covering it. Idun\u2019s strength pressed down its regenerability.</p><br/><p>The moment he would use the power of the God would only be when he attacked. And he would attack differently from how he had done so until now.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Idun.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho mumbled in a low voice and then charged. Makus flinched again and then took its hand off his abdomen and raised its sword.</p><br/><p>But Tae Ho didn\u2019t enter its range. He believed that there would be an opening sometime.</p><br/><p>And Siri replied with his thoughts.</p><br/><p>Puk!</p><br/><p>The stance of Makus, that was entirely focused on Tae Ho, crumbled. It was the result of Siri slamming herself against it instead of firing her crossbow. The monster could regenerate the wounds and even ignore pain, but it couldn\u2019t do anything about being pushed.</p><br/><p>Chwak!</p><br/><p>At that moment, Tae Ho cut through its arm. The monster let out a low scream and then fell into shock once again.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t simply having been hurt. It didn\u2019t only end at having cut off its sword, but the wound seemed to deepen everytime.</p><br/><p>\u2018It works.\u2019</p><br/><p>What Tae Ho was grabbing wasn\u2019t Runefang. It was the Executioner\u2019s sword, that was especially effective towards enemies that could regenerate. It was a magic sword that inflicted a bleeding status and continued damage.</p><br/><p>He would only wield the strength of the God the moment he attacked. And just like it did in the game, the special effect of the weapon would activate.</p><br/><p>The monster got flustered even more. The pain he had felt for a really long while made it dull.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho charged again. The monster raised its sword hurriedly, but it didn\u2019t have the ardor from before. Rather than exerting pressure, it had shrunk down.</p><br/><p>The monster was still strong. However, it started to mind Tae Ho\u2019s attacks. It started to defend, and its posture crumbled.</p><br/><p>The Executioner\u2019s sword, that was covered in gold light, passed by its body several times. The more blood flowed, the more its movements became dull.</p><br/><p>\u201cKua!\u201d</p><br/><p>The monster swung its sword widely while roaring. It was because it had realized that it couldn\u2019t continue like this. He had swung his sword that held unbelievable strength several times.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho was calm. He dodged the attacks that had become simple as they were strong. It was the same in the game. You needed to be calmer the grimmer was the situation. You had to observe the attacks of the enemies and counterattack.</p><br/><p>Makus\u2019s sword passed over his head. The excessively strong attack broke Makus\u2019s stance and Tae Ho realized that the time had come. He jumped as if entering its grasp.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a sharp stab attacked Tae Ho. It was Makus\u2019s tail. It was the secret card it had prepared.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho gritted his teeth and endured the pain. Instead of twisting his body to dodge the attack he charged forward.</p><br/><p>Makus\u2019s tail stabbed Tae Ho\u2019s shoulder. And at the same time, Tae Ho\u2019s sword stabbed deep in its abdomen.</p><br/><p>Curses came out by their own. Tae Ho gulped down Heda\u2019s name and then twisted the Executioner\u2019s sword. And before he let go of his hands he activated the warrior\u2019s sword once more.</p><br/><p>Pubuk!</p><br/><p>The Executioner\u2019s sword transformed to a heavy metal hammer. As it was inside its body, it broke down before perfectly transforming, but it was enough. The insides of the monster had become a mess.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhok!\u201d</p><br/><p>The monster vomited blood. Tae Ho had let go of the sword and then hit its stomach with his right palm strongly.</p><br/><p>The monster got out of breath. It fell back and Tae Ho activated the warrior\u2019s sword with his last strength. He inserted the God\u2019s strength in the Executioner\u2019s sword one more time.</p><br/><p>The sword that was swung from a high place cut down its head. Blood flowed endlessly from the deep wound.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho plucked down the tail that had stabbed his shoulder. Curses and screams came out at the same time but he endured it by gritting his teeth.</p><br/><p>The monster fell on its butt.</p><br/><p>And Tae Ho also fell on his butt. He let out a sigh mixed with a groan. At that moment the warriors cheered.</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun\u2019s warrior!\u201d</p><br/><p>Starting by Rolph, the warriors came running towards Tae Ho. Some of them stabbed Makus\u2019s corpse as if to ensure that it was dead.</p><br/><p>\u201cUwa! You are amazing! Really amazing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Rolph, that was especially excited, hugged Tae Ho. Honestly speaking, it hurt. And if he had to choose, he preferred Siri\u2019s embrace.</p><br/><p>However, Siri just smiled towards him. No, in the first place it seemed like she was also exhausted like Tae Ho. She was breathing roughly while sitting down.</p><br/><p>\u201cWa, wait.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho pushed back Rolph. Only then did Rolph get a hold of himself and let go of Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, the runes\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>He thought he would fall unconscious any moment.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho extended his palm to Makus\u2019s corpse. And then, the familiar runes and runes with attribute he had seen for the first time entered Tae Ho\u2019s palm.</p><br/><p>Life attribute rune.</p><br/><p>In addition, the amount was large.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you absorb it all?\u201d</p><br/><p>Rolph asked again and Tae Ho nodded. And then Rolph embraced him again. The other warriors did the same.</p><br/><p>It also hurt this time. Honestly speaking, it was even hard to breathe.</p><br/><p>So Tae Ho closed his eyes. As he was tired, it was reasonable for him to feel sleepy.</p><br/><p>But he didn\u2019t lose consciousness. Perhaps because he had absorbed life runes or he had yelled Heda\u2019s name instead of Idun in a decisive moment that Idun\u2019s blessing caught Tae Ho\u2019s consciousness.</p><br/><p>\u2018Oh, Idun.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho felt like he could get crushed by Rolph and closed his eyes. He couldn\u2019t sleep, so he was planning to rest even a little bit.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho thought of Heda\u2019s face instead of Rolph to calm himself and slowly fell asleep.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>The Giant that was in the darkness sensed Makus\u2019s death. This situation was also outside the Giant\u2019s expectation.</p><br/><p>Just what had happened? How did this happen?</p><br/><p>He could guess that later. The Giant thought of the things he had to do right now.</p><br/><p>He would stop the excavation that was being realized by the Mollo family. The moment the congress of the dark fairies had asked for help to the warriors of Valhalla because they had woken up a Basilisk while excavating was also a mistake by Mallus. He would also get rid of him.</p><br/><p>However, he wasn\u2019t planning to just fall back.</p><br/><p>The Basilisks Makus had called before it died became a strength for him.</p><br/><p>The Giant closed his eyes and the darkness covered him again.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>The first that had realized a change was Siri. She stood up from her place and then looked at her surroundings and then bit her lips.</p><br/><p>She, who had the senses of a veteran warrior, could feel it. Things that were emanating killing intent were gathering.</p><br/><p>Her side was already quite exhausted. It was right to flee instead of fighting them head-on.</p><br/><p>However, they didn\u2019t have the white silences anymore. Getting outside of their reach like they had done until now was impossible.</p><br/><p>\u201cSiri?\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the warriors called Siri. It was because he had also noticed the same thing as Siri.</p><br/><p>Siri looked at the corpses of the warriors. It was unfortunate but now wasn\u2019t the time to retrieve their corpses.</p><br/><p>\u201cGarm is still alive!\u201d</p><br/><p>The warrior that was treating the warrior that had received the first javelin attack yelled in joy. Siri was also happy, but she didn\u2019t refute the fact that he was a load.</p><br/><p>What could she do?</p><br/><p>Siri closed her eyes. She felt the enemies closing the distance even know and made a quick decision.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are scattering.\u201d</p><br/><p>The first thing they had to do was to regroup with Gandur. But it didn\u2019t mean that all of them had to do that.</p><br/><p>The warriors showed rejection at first but no one opposed it. It was because they also knew that that was the best course.</p><br/><p>Siri divided the groups. The remaining warriors would flee in three groups.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s meet in Valhalla again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThose are correct words, but it\u2019s somewhat ominous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because if they were in the mortal world it meant for them to meet again after they died.</p><br/><p>The warriors laughed in a low voice. Siri put on a smile mixed with a sigh and said again.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Asgard and the nine planets.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Asgard and the nine planets.\u201d</p><br/><p>The warriors didn\u2019t turn to look at each other anymore. They started to run with all their might.</p><br/><p>And how much time had passed.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho opened his eyes. What he was expecting was the bedroom he could see the ceiling of, but weirdly enough, what entered his eyes was still a forest.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho blinked in a half-awake state and then woke up completely. He was lying down a bulky and big root and Siri was next to him. It seemed like it had really become night as it was darker than the afternoon. He could see Siri\u2019s white skin.</p><br/><p>\u201cCaptain Siri?\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri turned to look at him. She was putting an exhausted expression but then placed a finger on her lip and started to explain the situation after silencing Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>Basilisks had gathered not long after he had defeated the regenerator. Siri\u2019s group had come to hunt the Basilisks but the situation was bad. In addition, they hadn\u2019t expected for the Basilisks to come in a group.</p><br/><p>In the end, they chose to scatter and flee to increase the survival rates, and Siri got in charge of the exhausted Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>She activated the stealth blessing in the middle of fleeing because she had gotten cornered, but it was a matter of time for them to get discovered.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wake me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he wouldn\u2019t have been a luggage.</p><br/><p>Siri answered with warm eyes at Tae Ho\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>\u201cI tried everything but you didn\u2019t wake up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps, it may be an aftereffect of activating the strength of the God excessively.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho just raised his body instead of asking what she had tried. As he concentrated he could hear leaves grazing near them.</p><br/><p>Just like Siri had said, they were really cornered. In addition, it seemed like the sound was becoming closer. If they were closing the range, then getting discovered was really a matter of time.</p><br/><p>What to do now. Would they hide until they were discovered and then fight?</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t think of anything in particular. He had the hawk\u2019s wing clothes, but it was impossible to fly properly in this place that was filled with a branch ceiling.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho gulped dry saliva and then looked at Siri. Siri answered with a low voice in his eyes asking if she had a method.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that you woke up, the choices have increased by one.\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri spoke up to there and then stood up after letting out a breath. She loosened up her cape and then also started to take off her armor.</p><br/><p>\u201cCaptain Siri?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho opened his eyes widely while looking at Siri that had become naked and Siri said in a bitter voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a Valkyrie, but take good care of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Saga: Wolf witch]</p><br/><p>White smoke instantly covered Siri, and a wolf with golden fur appeared in front of Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 9 \u2013 Svartalfheim (3) &gt; End</p><br/>\n</div>"}

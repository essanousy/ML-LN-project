He had stayed awake almost all night and so wanted to keep sleeping. However, that was impossible.</p><br/><p>He had too many things to do today. He needed to start working before it became the afternoon.</p><br/><p>\u201cUghh\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda groaned out loud. It didn\u2019t seem like she had awaken, but it seemed like she had reacted to the sound Tae Ho made while getting up.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, Tae Ho laughed like a fool. If Cuchulainn was here he would have said something about Tae Ho\u2019s smile, but fortunately he was with Scathach.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m pretty sure I gave Gae Bolg to her during the feast.\u2019</p><br/><p>His memories were fuzzy from drinking too much, but that should probably be the case.</p><br/><p>\u2018Anyways, Olympus\u2019 alcohol is amazing.\u2019</p><br/><p>Even though he was exhausted, the master of Asgard and Erin became completely drunk. He hadn\u2019t particularly lowered his abilities, but he got drunk naturally.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda, who was asleep, reacted immediately when Tae Ho pressed her cheeks. Tae Ho endured the urge to press and pinch her soft cheeks, but shook his head and stood up. He couldn\u2019t stay in bed any longer or he would give into his urges.</p><br/><p>He needed to start the day.</p><br/><p>Zeus had provided part of the Godly world of Olympus as a temporary lodging for the Gods of Asgard.</p><br/><p>It was a special place that only the 12 Olympians and few selected beings could enter, so it was the first time Gods of a foreign world had entered.</p><br/><p>After leaving a building that resembled a shrine, Tae Ho saw people who started the morning before him.</p><br/><p>After the battle ended, the tasks everyone needed to do was basically the same.</p><br/><p>Settling the battlefield. The most urgent thing to do was to pull back Asgard\u2019s forces.</p><br/><p>Mobilizing a massive army numbering in the hundreds of thousands wasn\u2019t easy. It was because the food consumed each day was overwhelming.</p><br/><p>The warriors of Valhalla had initially brought supplies, but this was quickly reaching a limit. Taking into account the amount of food remaining, the army should return immediately if it wanted to avoid starving.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t do anything about it as the situation in Olympus is a disaster.\u201d</p><br/><p>Originally, the army should have received food from Olympus but currently Olympus didn\u2019t have the capability to do so. It was because many critical areas of Olympus were devastated from the internal war that lasted for two months.</p><br/><p>A considerable amount of food was stored in Mount Olympus, but thinking about Olympus\u2019 future problems Asgard couldn\u2019t request for food. The amount wouldn\u2019t be enough to provide food to those that lost their homes and livelihoods.</p><br/><p>In the end, with Tae Ho\u2019s approval, Odin decided to withdraw Asgard\u2019s forces as fast as possible.</p><br/><p>\u201cFreya will have commanding rights and Ullr and Tyr will assist her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Odin had many things to discuss about such as the rewards for having aided them, the situation with Nyx and the other ancient Gods, etc. so he couldn\u2019t return to Asgard.</p><br/><p>Thor had to stay back to escort Odin. Odin quite believed in them and were even allies but he refused being left alone without any guards.</p><br/><p>Ullr and Tyr agreed without speaking back at Odin\u2019s proposal but it was different with Freya. She snorted and then spoke bluntly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to. I\u2019m staying back too. Who knows what you may do if you get left with Zeus alone? Don\u2019t speak nonsense.\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya had a strong belief about the bad influence that new friends could infringe upon him. And in her eyes, Zeus was the most ideal figure of a bad friend.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have nothing to say now that you are putting up Zeus.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Odin spoke with a biter face, Freya smiled with an overconfident face. She was always right just like Heda was.</p><br/><p>In the end, Ullr and Tyr became the ones that would lead the warriors of Valhalla on withdrawing. There was no reason to delay so they started to withdraw as soon as the afternoon came.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to return Heda?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho, that had gotten all the way down to the mount of Olympus to send away the warriors of Valhalla, looked sideways and asked. The eyes of Heda standing next to Tae Ho became sharper.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? You want me to leave quickly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, there\u2019s no way that\u2019s true. It\u2019s good if you stay with me but i\u2019m just worried\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>No matter what, Tae Ho was now the master of Asgard. It would be a lie to say that he wasn\u2019t worried about the harvesting of the golden apples, that was the most important resource of Asgard.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m also worried. Don\u2019t you have to return?\u2019</p><br/><p>Idun asked with an anxious voice. She had taken care of the golden apple everyday for almost a hundred years since she was born. They weren\u2019t even out in the outskirts of Asgard for a moment and were in a different world so it could only make her worried.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ugh, one or two days is fine.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018THat\u2019s true but i\u2019m still worried.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s fine, it will be. You also want to say here Idun.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018That\u2019s also true but\u2026.\u2019</p><br/><p>In the first place, it seemed like she wanted to stay in this place more than her desire to administer the golden apples that was the purpose she was born for.</p><br/><p>But Heda still had her last card. She whispered to the undecided Idun quickly.</p><br/><p>\u2018You also said that the God of meetings bothered you.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Um\u2026.right. Right, a deity isn\u2019t something that\u2019s acquired easily.\u2019</p><br/><p>What had he been doing in Olympus that he got a deity named \u2018God of meetings\u2019? It was a deity that has never been heard in Asgard, Olympus or even in the Temple.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeda?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was the voice of Tae Ho this time. Heda came to an end in her negotiation with Idun and then looked up at Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnd of my indecision. I decided to stay and Idun also said the same. So take that into acc\u2026.why is your face like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, you are just too cute.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was wondering what she was doing while opening her eyes widely but she was having a conference with Idun?</p><br/><p>Tae Ho laughed and Heda opened her eyes sharply.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that was the case. You grew up to the point that Idun and I are cute. So that was the case.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, that was the case.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho was now able to counterattack skillfully at the \u2018so that was the case\u2019 attack. When Heda opened her eyes roundly, Nidhogg that was checking the two of them pouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh\u2026.certainly Heda is too strong. Can\u2019t beat her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Should she say that her aura was different? If she compared her to Olympus, Heda was like Heracles.</p><br/><p>When Nidhogg mumbled with a depressed voice, Hydra tilted her head and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cNidhogg unnie. Is Heda a bad person? Why are you talking about beating her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that. So\u2026uh\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg smacked her lips to try to explain with her short vocabulary. And fortunately, Adenmaha opened her mouth before Nidhogg and Hydra started to explain to everyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t leave you like this forever so I should interrupt.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha shrugged her shoulders and then breathed lightly and walked towards Tae Ho and Heda. Nidhogg saw that and pouted once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cAdenmaha has also become stronger. She has more leisure. Nidhogg is the weakest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop saying weird things and follow me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha snorted lightly and approached Tae Ho and Heda confidently.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAdenmaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Tae Ho turned around, Adenmaha answered with a good smile for now and then exchanged a short glance with Heda. It looked like members of a secret association were exchanging a secret.</p><br/><p>\u201cEchidna says she has something to say. It seems like it\u2019s quite important.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEchidna? I understand, I will go immediately. I still have some time until the conference.\u201d</p><br/><p>She hadn\u2019t participated in the conference of yesterday and obviously in the battle because of the injuries she suffered against Poseidon. He didn\u2019t know what Echidna could be looking him for but he got worried about her first.</p><br/><p>But it was at that moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cEchidna?\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda asked briefly and Adenmaha answered immediately.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s an ancient dragon of Olympus. Master\u2019s\u2026.wait a moment, she\u2019s the fifth dragon.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Adenmaha raised five of her fingers and said, Heda\u2019s eyes sharpened once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cSHe\u2019s a female right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course she\u2019s a female.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda and Adenmaha spoke stiffly and headed to the same directly. The one Echidna called was Tae Ho but it seemed like the two people weren\u2019t even aware of him.</p><br/><p>\u2018They have really good coordination. How good.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn laughed and Tae Ho cried while smiling.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be able to tell him to make children with me anymore. I was trying to seduce him properly as a commemoration for his promotion.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHoo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda said briefly at Echidna\u2019s mumble and Tae Ho got nervous.</p><br/><p>\u201cEchidna? Don\u2019t joke.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he spoke earnestly in an unconscious way, Echidna opened her eyes widely and giggled.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, well. It\u2019s nothing much. I thought we should settle the courses of our actions.\u201d</p><br/><p>Echidna spoke up to that point and then inhaled lightly and fixed her expression. She turned to look at Heda and Adenmaha once and said to Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster is going to leave Olympus and return to Asgard right? You remember what we spoke about the city of monsters and myself right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI do remember. What do you want me to do? I will try to fulfill your wishes the most I can.\u201d</p><br/><p>Echidna had been worrying long ago about what would happen after everything ended, after they defeated Nyx. The 12 Olympians could cooperate with the monsters saying that they needed their assistance but they couldn\u2019t know how they would change after they got a bit of leisure.</p><br/><p>She had already been tricked by them many times in the past.</p><br/><p>As Tae Ho agreed to it seriously, Echidna took a breath and then spoke with a calm breath.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to follow master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Leaving Olympus and to Asgard.</p><br/><p>\u201cWill it really be fine?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have been in Olympus for a long time. It won\u2019t be a bad thing to set up a base in a new place. I\u2019m also a dragon God of Erin and not only of Olympus thanks to master. If you return to Asgard you are also going to reconstruct Erin there right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho nodded at Echidna\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still at the designing phase but we do have a plan. Instead of gnawing at Olympus and Asgard spreading Erin in it, I\u2019m planning to raise Erin in the destroyed Erin once again.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was something they couldn\u2019t even dream of before but it was possible now that he was the master of two worlds.</p><br/><p>Even if Odin and Zeus allowed it, in the end Asgard and Olympus wasn\u2019t Erin. Rather than making Erin inside of those worlds, reconstructing Erin in the destroyed world brought no confusion and was better that way.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s perfect. It doesn\u2019t seem like bringing all my children with me will be of any problem. It should be at a stage where you need residents first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true but\u2026.is it fine getting apart from Typhon?\u201d</p><br/><p>Typhon, that was Echidna\u2019s first husband and the man she still couldn\u2019t forget about, was in a state that wasn\u2019t dead or alive.</p><br/><p>Echidna put on a painful expression at Tae Ho\u2019s question but then put a smile again and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually that bothers me the most but\u2026.I just have to return at times. I\u2019m also an ancient dragon of Olympus.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, let\u2019s do it like that then. Do you have a migration plan or something?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Echidna started to speak about the general plan. It was an earnest emigration and wasn\u2019t something that could be taken care of by counting with one\u2019s fingers so it seemed like she had set up a considerable plan before calling Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>Heda looked at them for a moment and then put a slightly satisfied face and nodded.</p><br/><p>But it was at that time.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm Heda.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><br/><p>When she turned back she saw Nidhogg standing there. She pulled on Heda\u2019s sleeve and spoke with an excited tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know, you know. There\u2019s something i\u2019m curious about. I have been curious about it but I have been enduring it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWHat are you curious about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda became soft naturally in front of Nidhogg\u2019s attitude that was like a pure child. Nidhogg smiled brightly and then asked with shining eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow are children made?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow are children made?\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed like she hadn\u2019t heard it wrong. Heda blinked a few more times and then tilted her head and asked back instead of sending an SOS to Idun.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026first, why are you asking that to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg spoke about the process there was until now. When she asked everyone in this place they told her to ask Scathach and when she asked her she told her to ask Heda.</p><br/><p>Heda\u2019s eyes became sharp.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that was the case. You have been tossing around the bomb and it came to me. Even Scathach did that.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other people was another thing but for even Scathach to do it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeda is scary\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg looked for Hydra and Adenmaha for her mental stability but the two of them had already noticed things and had distanced themselves. Adenmaha especially was trying really hard not to look at them.</p><br/><p>And Heda said.</p><br/><p>\u201cNidhogg.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda smiled once again as Nidhogg blinked and shrugged her shoulders.She touched Nidhogg\u2019s cheek and tossed the bomb again.</p><br/><p>\u201cAsk Tae Ho about that.\u201d</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>The few days after that were really busy.</p><br/><p>First, Zeus woke up Hades and he lead the souls of the dead ones roaming in the mortal world to the underworld. The Valkyries and Freya helped them and Odin and Tae Ho made Aphrodite fall in a deep slumber by force.</p><br/><p>Thor and Athena went out to capture Dionysius together and they were able to succeed after a few days since they departed.</p><br/><p>Zeus was planning to wake up Heracles and Artemis after that. He also didn\u2019t forget to meet with Gaia and ask her about the last words Nyx left behind.</p><br/><p>The end is nearing.</p><br/><p>Not even Gaia could know the precise meaning it held. She had many sides in her that didn\u2019t connect with the other ancient Gods as she was the first one to obtain a soul and body and come down to the mortal world.</p><br/><p>And after a few days again. Tae Ho finished discussing with Odin, Zeus, etc. about how Olympus would repay them back because of their assistance this time and prepared to leave Olympus. It was now time to return to Asgard.</p><br/><p>\u201cFreya, Thor and I will stay a bit more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will be waiting for your return.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho shared short words with Odin and then turned to look at the 12 Olympians that had come down the mount of Olympus to send them away.</p><br/><p>The members of Asgard including the children of Echidna amounted to hundreds of thousands but the side of the 12 Olympians that came to send them off wasn\u2019t small either. It was because the several Gods of Olympus they hadn\u2019t been able to see until now had also come to send them off.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster of Asgard and Erin. I express deep gratitude to you as the wife of the king of Gods Zeus and as the queen of Gods.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hera put a graceful smile and spoke while representing everyone that had come to send him off. Tae Ho hit his left chest lightly and expressed etiquette.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Asgard and the nine realms. I just did the obvious thing. We also did in the past and just like it is in the present, Asgard will still be at Olympus\u2019 side in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bragi\u2019s rune also worked hard today. Hera smiled really elegantly and took a deep breath as if getting resoluted.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster of Asgard and Erin, I know that you have already spoken about the repay with Zeus. But I prepared something else besides that so will you receive it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt would be an honor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho answered immediately and gulped dry saliva. It was because he could sense what was the thing Hera prepared.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a meeting.\u201d</p><br/><p>The maybe was a certainly. Hera said and she placed her lips on Tae Ho\u2019s and gave him the best blessing.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho got surprised and opened his eyes widely as he had been thinking that he would get blessed in the forehead and then flinched at the chill that he felt at his back.</p><br/><p>But that wasn\u2019t the end.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a meeting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA meeting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is a meeting.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Goddess of victory Nike, the Goddess of youth Hebe, and the Goddess of hell Persephone.</p><br/><p>The Goddesses of Olympus formed a line and then stood up and said that it was a meeting. Their number would easily surpass a dozen.</p><br/><p>\u2018So you are finally going down in it\u2026.the path of the evil God of meetings!\u2019</p><br/><p>The meeting still proceeded while Cuchulainn was speaking uselessly seriously and every time the blessing of the Goddesses got added the chill he felt at his back also got stronger.</p><br/><p>And after some time passed. Athena and Demeter put a meaningful smile and raised their thumbs towards Tae Ho that was dripping cold sweat and was stricken afraid. It seemed like the festival of meetings was a work of the two of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that was the case. You became so many meetings that you became the evil God of meetings. That was the case.\u201d</p><br/><p>When all the meetings ended, Heda spoke in a cold way and Adenmaha looked at Tae Ho with cold eyes.</p><br/><p>And Cuchulainn asked without being aware of his surroundings.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hey, but what are the effects of the God of meetings? Receiving more meetings?\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho ignored him like usual and felt the pressure behind his back and started to return to Asgard.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 64 \u2013 God of meetings (2) &gt; End</p><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/>\n</div>"}

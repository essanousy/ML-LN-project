Even if it were left to rust for millenia, Caliburn wasn\u2019t a sword to acknowledge someone without the proper qualifications.</p><br/><p>It had been the same with King Arthur. Merlin wasn\u2019t disappointed to learn that Caliburn had chosen a small, frail child as its bearer. The sword\u2019s authority held such a weight.</p><br/><p>He\u2019d willingly offered his services as loyal advisor to the young lord because of the sword\u2019s decision. The only thing he\u2019d worried over was the correct way to guide him.</p><br/><p>As he reminisced, he realized the current situation held many similarities. He\u2019d first grabbed the attention of the young king by talking about treasures and the obstacles he\u2019d one day face.</p><br/><p>Merlin put on a comfortable smile as spoke to Tae Ho, while Tae Ho seemed to struggle with keeping a cool attitude.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t really fair to compare King Arthur as a child to Tae Ho who\u2019d already grown up, but it was an unavoidable comparison. To become immersed in one\u2019s memories was a privilege of the elderly.</p><br/><p>Merlin closed his eyes slowly. In order to tell his story proper, he had to relive the painful memories before the good ones.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere was an enormous battle on the day of Erin\u2019s destruction. From Asgard had come the God of Thunder with a great army to assist us, but they ended up arriving too late.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he announced Thor\u2019s title, Bracky appeared out of thin air to sit beside Tae Ho. Helga, who sat by Merlin, blinked her big, clear eyes at the sudden and unfamiliar story.</p><br/><p>\u201cKing Arthur included, most of the Knights of the Round Table lost their lives in that battle. I managed to save myself, but it came with a price. After the magic I\u2019d used to survive was unraveled, dozens of years had passed. The Great War had already ended in Asgard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Merlin was being intentionally vague. In the first place, he\u2019d meant to speak of Erin\u2019s legacies, not the deaths of King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table.</p><br/><p>Recalling that day was really painful and difficult for him.</p><br/><p>Merlin remembered the final moment of King Arthur\u2019s life. He couldn\u2019t forget the back of the King as he charged into the enemy\u2019s ranks to buy time for the few survivors of Camelot to escape.</p><br/><p>How was it that only he\u2019d survived?</p><br/><p>Why hadn\u2019t the magician of the king protected him better?</p><br/><p>The answers were marks on his soul.</p><br/><p>Merlin opened his eyes slowly and looked at Tae Ho while waiting to be criticized. He feared Tae Ho\u2019s response.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho didn\u2019t say anything, although his expression was destitute. His eyes seemed to worry for Merlin\u2019s well being, but Merlin only smiled in response.</p><br/><p>From beside Tae Ho, Bracky clicked his tongue and comfortingly patted the shoulder of Merlin as if his burdens were too heavy for an old man to bear.</p><br/><p>Of course, it was still a rude action. Regardless of that, Merlin\u2019s appreciation for the warriors of Valhalla grew even more.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter I woke, I started gathering the legacies of Erin.\u201d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s annihilation had been too sudden. The Giant of Fire, Surtr, destroyed everything without any thought of ruling Erin, so Merlin was powerless to prevent many legacies from entering the hands of the enemies or being completely destroyed altogether.</p><br/><p>The first things he\u2019d searched for were the relics belonging to King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Knights of the Round Table that survived Camelot that day still lost their lives in the Great War that followed. Knowing this, I went out to uncover the traces of the Great War that were left across the planets. Luckily enough, I was able to achieve something.\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t easy searching for the legacies like the fomoires, but he was still a great magician of Camelot. There wasn\u2019t anyone in any world that knew more about magical weapons than him.</p><br/><p>Arondight, the sword of Lancelot, the strongest Knight of the Round Table, fell into the hands of the fomoires. Fortunately enough, Merlin was still able to retrieve Gallatin, the sword of Gawain, Knight of the Sun. Gawain had possessed a power comparable to Lancelot\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Gallatin, the twin sword of Excalibur, was one of the best weapons among the ones Merlin possessed.</p><br/><p>Because of that, Merlin sealed it with his most powerful spell and hid it in a place the fomoires would never find it.</p><br/><p>\u201cGallatin is in Vanaheim.\u201d</p><br/><p>Vanaheim, the land of the Vanir.</p><br/><p>Ingrid, who\u2019d also joined the group, opened her eyes wide in surprise. It was a surprise knowing that a live human had entered Vanaheim. The Vanir race didn\u2019t even welcome the Aesir, the dominant race in Asgard.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026understandable. The fomoires would never search for it there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Vanaheim was a small world compared to the gargantuan Asgard. It was impossible for the fomoires from the elementals below ground. The elementals were subordinates of the Vanir and had sensitive eyes and ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a distance we can cross in a mere moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Harabal clicked his tongue as if it was unfortunate. As the present battle against the fomoires loomed before them, they couldn\u2019t travel to Vanaheim on a whim.</p><br/><p>\u2018I can understand why he planted those messages in the Liberatuses.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn smiled bitterly and said. Tae Ho also remembered the words Merlin spoke in his message.</p><br/><p>Merlin had concealed his resentment through jokes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour eyes are too heated, so I will only speak of the legacies here in Midgard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Merlin discussed each legacy in Midgard with detail. Although they weren\u2019t as strong as Gallatin, they were all magical weapons with profound origins.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, a problem lay in the vast distance between each of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have an illness? Some disease where you couldn\u2019t relax unless you scattered them as far as possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Harabal asked with absurd eyes, Merlin snorted bitterly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was the only way to ensure the path of Erin\u2019s successor. Besides, I only scattered a part of them. Most of them are gathered in one particular spot.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho was sure it was the place mentioned in the message within the prototype of Liberatus.</p><br/><p>As Bracky mentioned the place which he barely remembered, Ingrid smiled with her eyes and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s that place, we will be able to pass through it during this mission.\u201d</p><br/><p>Their mission of destroying the fomoires\u2019 base was a secret.</p><br/><p>Even the warriors of Midgard and the believers that traveled with them didn\u2019t know of their true objective. They believed that the warriors of Valhalla were only traveling to perhaps uncover any unexpected changes in Midgard.</p><br/><p>As it was, Merlin had also been unaware of the real purpose of their mission.</p><br/><p>\u2018We don\u2019t particularly have the time to speak for long either.\u2019</p><br/><p>The first conversation they\u2019d had since meeting had already become a treasured one.</p><br/><p>As they concluded with the decision to visit Merlin\u2019s hideout, Tae Ho opened his mouth hesitatingly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything about Excalibur?\u201d</p><br/><p>Excalibur, the sword of King Arthur.</p><br/><p>It was the strongest God Sword that could be described as the pinnacle of Camelot, and it had been the sword that had defined King Arthur\u2019s legend from beginning to end.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnfortunately, I haven\u2019t found any traces of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Merlin\u2019s words were bitter.</p><br/><p>It was obvious that Excalibur had been the legacy he\u2019d sought after most.</p><br/><p>The Sword of Selection which King Arthur had pulled from a stone and Excalibur the fairy God sword which he had received from the Fairy of the Lake were the two trademarks of King Arthur\u2019s legend.</p><br/><p>If the Fairy of the Lake still lived, Merlin could have asked for guidance regarding Excalibur, but the lake had disappeared with Erin.</p><br/><p>They could only pray for Excalibur not to have landed in the hands of the fomoires or giants.</p><br/><p>With Merlin\u2019s story of legacies concluded, Valkyrie Ingrid and the warriors of Valhalla were left to their own devices. It was finally time to resume their journey now that Merlin, who they had waited for, had joined them.</p><br/><p>As Siri and Helga also left, Merlin also attempted to stand, but Tae Ho grabbed onto Merlin and took out something from Unnir and presented it to him.</p><br/><p>It was nothing other than Gae Bolg.</p><br/><p>Merlin stared at the almost-completed Gae Bolg with a look of utter surprise. He was confused as to why Tae Ho had held it out to him.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho just waited without offering an explanation, and Merlin understood the moment he grabbed Gae Bolg.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s been a while, King\u2019s magician.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was Cuchulainn\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho made a gesture with his hands telling him to speak slowly, and he then walked off towards the flying ship, leaving the two alone. Merlin sat down once more and listened to Cuchulainn\u2019s story.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn told him of how Bedevere and the last Knights of the Round Table faced their ends.</p><br/><p>Merlin just listened to him quietly as tears rolled down his face.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn then explained his current state, and he also elaborated on Scathach.</p><br/><p>\u2018Master is currently in the residence of Idun. You should have realized it already, but we also have Adenmaha, a Goddess of the Tuatha De Danann. If we add you, won\u2019t it really become a small Erin?\u2019</p><br/><p>He cracked a joke at the last part.</p><br/><p>However, Merlin felt grief and sadness at Cuchulainn\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Erin\u2019s successor.</p><br/><p>The one that would inherit the entirety of what remained from Erin.</p><br/><p>Merlin had been there when the Kings of Erin had gathered and created the decree. He knew what it meant to become the successor of Erin better than anyone else.</p><br/><p>But Merlin wasn\u2019t planning on demanding something from Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t even urge him to raise Camelot when they had to rebuild Erin once again.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t the time for all that. Not yet.</p><br/><p>The worlds were still at stake. The war was long from over.</p><br/><p>The humans of Midgard just lived leisurely without care, but it was different outside the great barrier.</p><br/><p>The Great War had merely been the start.</p><br/><p>The giants would attack once again. One couldn\u2019t know when the flames of war would arise just like Erin\u2019s destruction had arrived all too suddenly.</p><br/><p>The reconstruction of Erin and Camelot were things for after the war\u2019s conclusion.</p><br/><p>For now, it was more important to fight and stay alive.</p><br/><p>\u2018So, you\u2019re saying it\u2019s not time for the magician to reign yet?\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn also agreed on this point, and because of that he and Scathach also hadn\u2019t urged Tae Ho to rebuild Erin.</p><br/><p>Merlin thought of when he\u2019d built Camelot alongside King Arthur. He didn\u2019t rush anything back then. The glory of Camelot had only begun to shine after King Arthur, who\u2019d started as a small and frail kid, had grown up to become a reliable king.</p><br/><p>The magician of the king wasn\u2019t someone who led the king. He was someone that protected the king.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s focus on the battle in before us for now.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn spoke rather cheerfully and then began elaborating on the battle with the fomoires that would occur in a few days time.</p><br/><p>Approximately fifteen days after that-</p><br/><p>The group hopped off the flying pirate ship and stealthily headed towards the place Merlin had specified.</p><br/><p>Their destination was Kallav Ahim.</p><br/><p>It was a human country within which the fomoires had hidden themselves.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 27 \u2013 The sword of selection (4) &gt; End</p><br/><p>ED note: Fifteen days later?!

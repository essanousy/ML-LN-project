He did atrocious actions everyday that made you see him as having become degenerated as time passed and did a really wicked thing on a woman that was the reincarnation of a Goddess so he pulled the entire country with him and received a big curse.</p><br/><p>\u2018Men will receive pain the moment they need strength the most and they won\u2019t be able to use their strength in the fourth night and fifth afternoon.\u2019</p><br/><p>The king and citizens that got surprised tried to soothe her and change the name of their country to part of the name of the Goddess \u2019Eamhain Mhacha\u2019, but it was all meaningless.</p><br/><p>The rage of the Goddess didn\u2019t dissipate and in the end the king and his citizens couldn\u2019t use their strength when they got invaded by the enemy and on other things.</p><br/><p>But the country of the king still didn\u2019t collapse after that. It didn\u2019t even get shaken at the countless dangers it faced through the cases like the invasions.</p><br/><p>The only person that didn\u2019t get cursed by the Goddess.</p><br/><p>The great hero that possessed power enough to protect his country alone.</p><br/><p>The prince of light Cuchulainn.</p><br/><p>It was because that man was there.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>Nidhogg smiled in a good mood after having let out a roar that shook all of Asgard.</p><br/><p>But of course, that was in her essence form as an ancient dragon and at the same time a dragon Goddess and not in her huge body that reached 2kms.</p><br/><p>\u201cNidhogg! Nidhogg!\u201d</p><br/><p>The loud yell that was heard as a bug buzzing for Nidhogg continued to be heard. Nidhogg rolled her eyes as the black dragon and then could discover the owner of the voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cOhh! Nidhogg! Do you recognize me?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The huge bird spoke in an excited voice. The appearance of the bird and his heated voice were all too familiar for her but regardless of that Nidhogg tilted her head and said.</p><br/><p>[Uh\u2026Hraesvelgr grandpa?]</p><br/><p>The black dragon didn\u2019t open its mouth to speak. But Nidhogg\u2019s will itself got transmitted to Hraesvelgr and Hraesvelgr, that was riding on his own original body nodded diligently.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, i\u2019m your equal Hraesvelgr!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hraesvelgr spoke with a really happy face and voice. But Nidhogg blinked once again and then realized why she felt weird.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelgr was certainly big in her memories and right now Hraesvelgr wasn\u2019t like that at all.</p><br/><p>[Grandpa is really tiny!]</p><br/><p>He was small. Really small.</p><br/><p>And this was something unavoidable. If the difference in length of their bodies was 20 times, then the size of their bodies would be more than a hundred.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelgr staggered at the happy, yet strong fact attack of Nidhogg. However, he claimed with a loud voice as someone that didn\u2019t know what giving up was.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I will also get big!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the first place, Hraesvelgr\u2019s original body was a kind of magic armor that was born with magic. He would be able to increase the size of his body if he poured magic power to it.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg opened her eyes roundly at Hraesvelgr\u2019s claim and then asked with an expectant voice.</p><br/><p>[Will grandpa become as big as Nidhogg?]</p><br/><p>Her way of speaking was saying that she really hoped that.</p><br/><p>Because of that, Hraesvelgr could only drip cold sweat. It was good to have claimed it magnanimously but the problem was that Nidhogg was just too big.</p><br/><p>Impossible. Absolutely impossible.</p><br/><p>But Hraesvelgr couldn\u2019t say that he couldn\u2019t do it. He opened his mouth with difficulty and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I will try.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy king\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Vedrfolnir couldn\u2019t stop her tears from falling down at the pitiful appearance of her king. At the same time, she fell once again for her king. It was because his ungiving spirit in front of the impossible had moved her heart.</p><br/><p>If Cuchulainn was here he would have clicked his tongue saying that her love for him was comparable to Tae Ho\u2019s but fortunately the only one here was Nidhogg.</p><br/><p>[Anyways, Nidhogg will go down now. Uh\u2026 but grandpa Hraesvelgr, are you fine?]</p><br/><p>\u201cFine? What are you talking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I mean, the poison?]</p><br/><p>Nidhogg spoke in an unconfident tone and turned to look at herself. Her pitch black body was covered by a faint green smoke.</p><br/><p>But Hraesvelgr didn\u2019t show signs of being in pain even though he was inside that smoke. He actually frowned as if he had only realized after Nidhogg remarked that and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm? Now that I see, compared to the other body you used, this one doesn\u2019t release poison. Rather\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[Rather?]</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel a holy aura. I feel like my strength is being recovered the closer I get to you. Is this also your power?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hraesvelgr wasn\u2019t saying that for nothing. It was because the property of the smoke covering Nidhogg had really changed like he had said.</p><br/><p>From a nasty poison that annihilated everyone that approached her into a holy aura that took care and healed other.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg bit her lips. She endured her tears from falling down and said in a good mood.</p><br/><p>[Yes, that\u2019s right. I don\u2019t resent anyone and I rather like them. It\u2019s like that now.]</p><br/><p>The heart of Audhumla had changed. Nidhogg also didn\u2019t resent anyone now.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit difficult to understand but that should be a good thing anyways.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hraesvelgr spoke like that as he didn\u2019t know of Audhumla\u2019s situation and them smiled warmly. He got more relaxed if he spoke with Nidhogg.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg spoke once again.</p><br/><p>[Anyways, i\u2019m going to return to Valhalla now. Do you want to come with me?]</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, fine. Even if that wasn\u2019t the case, Valhalla had sent a messenger and he has stayed noisy so let\u2019s go down together.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Then ride on Nidhogg\u2019s back]</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Hraesvelgr answered briefly, he moved his original body and rode on Nidhogg\u2019s back. Actually, the difference in size was so big he felt like he had landed on an island rather than on the back of someone.</p><br/><p>[Grandpa, did you get on? I can\u2019t feel anything.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I did.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m going then!]</p><br/><p>Nidhogg yelled in a good mood and turned to look at the ground and then fluttered her wings again.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>The time Nidhogg opened her eyes again was when the black dragon landed right next to Valhalla.</p><br/><p>Actually the size of her body was 2kms long so it was no different from an island so the distance between Valhalla was quite considerable.</p><br/><p>When the warriors of Valhalla came out flocking to see the black dragon, Adenmaha that had been looking at the essence of Nidhogg with a nervous face let out a sigh of relief. It was because Nidhogg had been putting an absent minded expression but then smiled brightly as if nothing had happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid it end well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt ended well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg spoke up to that point and then stood up to embrace Adenmaha.</p><br/><p>\u201cNidhogg?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAdenmaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg dropped her body in Adenmaha\u2019s embrace as if melting down. Adenmaha got flustered as she saw that Nidhogg didn\u2019t have as much strength as she thought so she inserted more strength in her arms and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you fine?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes. I\u2019m okay. But i\u2019m too sleepy. I don\u2019t have any strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Certainly, an indirect introduction.\u2019</p><br/><p>Because Nidhogg\u2019s original body was really huge.</p><br/><p>In the first place, that was a kind of magic armor so if it was any other living being it would be impossible to breathe and even less move it as they wouldn\u2019t be able to endure their own weight.</p><br/><p>The power that moved Nidhogg\u2019s original body was her magic power. Nidhogg\u2019s body had an overwhelming amount of magic power stored in it but the one that moved it was her in the end.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t only pass the roots but she had also flown to the ends of the world in an instant so the amount of magic power she spent would be great and the burden on Nidhogg would also be as big.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have done well. Let\u2019s rest now. I will face Hraesvelgr-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes\u2026 wake me up when Tae Ho master comes later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Adenmaha stroke her head, Nidhogg closed her eyes. But she opened them again after a few seconds and then raised her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cNidhogg?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought of something I had to say before falling asleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout Audhumla\u2019s story.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg started to speak about Audhumla with a sleepy voice. Parts of her story was cut down and was sloppy as expected of her but there was no problem in understanding the general outline.</p><br/><p>\u201cAudhumla doesn\u2019t resent anyone anymore. No, she has been like that since before. She has liked everyone since before.\u201d</p><br/><p>She wanted to say this. She wanted to transmit Audhumla\u2019s story to the others the fastest she could.</p><br/><p>Compared to Nidhogg, Audhumla had really perceived the others for a long time. And she also knew why she had been trapped.</p><br/><p>But regardless of that, she still heard Nidhogg\u2019s words. She decided to love instead of hate the world just like Nidhogg did.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you Nidhogg. For having chosen us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha spoke with a teary voice and hugged Nidhogg. Nidhogg rubbed her face in Adenmaha\u2019s chest and smiled brightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m also grateful Adenmaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>And then closed her eyes. She breathed soundly and fell asleep.</p><br/><p>\u201cSleep well Nidhogg. I will ask Heda to make many things you like.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha spoke in a low voice as if she had really become a mother and closed her eyes following Nidhogg. And then shared her warmth with her.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 so are you saying that in the end Odin-nim is at fault?\u201d</p><br/><p>After about one hour since that happened, Adenmaha told the story to Tae Ho, Heda and Freya that had returned to Valhalla on the cat carriage and that was the conclusion Heda came with after hearing everything.</p><br/><p>Because the ones that had exterminated Audhumla at the same time with Ymir and threw them in Ginnungagap were Odin, his father Bor and his grandfather Buri.</p><br/><p>But Freya got enraged at Heda\u2019s words and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you saying? That was the best he could do at that time. In the first place, it\u2019s a bit vague to say that Odin-nim was the same being from back then. That was also before he completely awakened a consciousness.\u201d</p><br/><p>And in the first place if part of Audhumla was left then giants like Ymir may have been born just like Buri and Bor were concerned about.</p><br/><p>Heda let out a \u2018He\u2019ing sound at Freya\u2019s heated argument and then opened her eyes sharply and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was the case. So that was the case.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWh, what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m just saying.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda smirked and Freya flushed and frowned.</p><br/><p>And Tae Ho thought while looking at the two of them.</p><br/><p>\u2018The so that was the case attack is strong no matter who you use it at. SO that was the case.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn agreed earnestly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Anyways, everything ended well. I had also felt that it was really big when I saw it before but back then I saw it in a place with nothing to compare it to so I just sensed that it was only big\u2026 but now that I see it again it really is huge.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Didn\u2019t you say the same thing?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Anyways, she is also overflowing in magic power. Echidna didn\u2019t say that she was an ancient dragon in another level for nothing.\u2019</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t only because the time they were born was different.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ancient God Audhumla\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>An existence that could be compared to the Goddess of night Nyx of Olympus.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways, it seems like the sun will set soon. Why don\u2019t you return now? It would be good to rest two days for Nidhogg\u2019s recovery. Perhaps\u2026 it may be the last opportunity you will be able to rest comfortably.\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya cooled down the heat by fanning herself with her hand and said.</p><br/><p>And her words weren\u2019t wrong. If they headed to the Temple, only battles against the Kingdom of Fire would be waiting for them.</p><br/><p>\u201cShall we return now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s return, master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha and Heda looked at Tae Ho with a vague expectation and said. It seemed like the two of them were planning on spending the remaining two days in quality time.</p><br/><p>But Tae Ho flinched instead of smiling and answering the same. The quick witted Heda asked with an uneasy tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha also frowned and put uneasy eyes. It was because the two of them guessed to some extent what Tae Ho was going to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 I just remembered that I have one more thing to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had one more thing aside of liberating Nidhogg\u2019s original body from the roots. Something he had to take care of before heading to the Temple.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you give me one day\u2026 no, half a day?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho asked Adenmaha and Heda and the two of them let out sighs almost at the same time.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>\u2018Hey you bastard. If you are going to useless things do it alone, why did you drag me into it? Ahh master. I want to see you.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018She\u2019s right in front of you.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Not like this! Entrust Gae Bolg to master quickly and return!\u2019</p><br/><p>When Tae Ho returned to the residence of Idun he headed to the lodging of Scathach while receiving sharp gazes from Heda and Adenmaha. It was to do something he could only do at her lodging.</p><br/><p>\u2018But Cuchulainn. You seem like you are quite happy even though you speak like that. Should I say that your body is being honest?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Hey you crazy bastard. What kind of nonsense is that? And where do I have a body? Huh? WHere\u2019s my body.\u2019</p><br/><p>It had always been like this but time flowed really quickly when they spoke about nonsense.</p><br/><p>Actually, Tae Ho was conversing with Cuchulainn but if you saw him from a side he was grinning alone and Scathach was preparing mystical magic in front of it. Scathach raised her head. It was because all the preparations had ended.</p><br/><p>\u201cEverything is ready, but are you going to do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho fixed his expression at Scathach\u2019s question and nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter I go to the Temple\u2026 I really won\u2019t have time after that. I want to do everything I can before that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, I respect your will. It will certainly be of help.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Tower of shadows.</p><br/><p>The place he had spent almost 2 years after he entered it after the battle against the king of Fomoires, the Tyrant Bress.</p><br/><p>Back then he hadn\u2019t been able to go until the end. Part of it was because he lacked time but honestly speaking it was because his capabilities lacked.</p><br/><p>But he was different now.</p><br/><p>It was time to conquer the Tower of shadows that no one except for one person had been able to conquer.</p><br/><p>\u2018It feels uncomfortable if I stop doing it after clearing it.\u2019</p><br/><p>If you start a game you should see the end of it.</p><br/><p>The time he promised Heda and Adenmaha was 12 hours. It was a month inside the Tower of shadows where time flowed 30 times more quickly.</p><br/><p>But that was enough.</p><br/><p>\u201cClose your eyes. I will start the ritual.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho closed his eyes.</p><br/><p>And then opened his eyes in the middle of the ritual.</p><br/><p>The doors of the Tower of shadow opened.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 68 \u2013 Descent of the immortal God (1) &gt; End</p><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/>\n</div>"}

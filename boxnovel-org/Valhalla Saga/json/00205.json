He would have understood if it was a shield or some armor but a scabbard was really unexpected.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is he talking about a scabbard like Excalibur\u2019s?\u2019</p><br/><p>As Cuchulainn asked with a tone that he had thought back into the past, Tae Ho asked right after him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you know something?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I only heard through rumors that the scabbard of King Arthur is a greater treasure than his sword, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case. What I do know is that the scabbard doesn\u2019t make the owner bleed when they receive an injury.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018They don\u2019t bleed?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, that should be a form of expressing it. Just like amplifying your recovery rate so that blood doesn\u2019t flow. Anyways, it doesn\u2019t seem like Hephaestus is trying to recreate the scabbard of Excalibur. What we are trying to make now is a weapon to defeat Poseidon.\u2019</p><br/><p>Those were reasonable words. In the first place, the reason Prometheus said he needed Hephaestus\u2019 help was to make a weapon specialized for Poseidon, not to simply make a strong weapon.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll need that sort of recovery item. I already have Idun-nim\u2019s blessing and the golden apples.\u2019</p><br/><p>Actually not all of Tae Ho\u2019s recovered like before with one bite of Idun\u2019s golden apples since he got stronger after becoming a master but he could still expect r a considerable effect.</p><br/><p>It was the same for Idun\u2019s blessing so Tae Ho had really persistent vitality.</p><br/><p>In addition, he had recovery specialized items of Dark Age which he could recreate with the \u2018equipment of the dragon knight\u2019 so it didn\u2019t seem like he needed more.</p><br/><p>\u2018Right, and they are starting to look at you with eyes implying, \u2018what is that bastard doing alone over there?\u2019\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I suddenly got a thought.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone got awkward as Tae Ho spoke while laughing. Tae Ho had acted like his usual self without any awareness but he was still the master of a foreign world for the others. They didn\u2019t know how to act if he acted this polite.</p><br/><p>But fortunately, the awkward silence didn\u2019t last for long. It was because Hermes opened his mouth as he had already grown quite accustomed to Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cHephaestus hyung-nim. Just what kind of scabbard are you planning to make? What we need is a weapon to defeat Poseidon.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed like Hermes thought the same thing after remembering the conversation with Tae Ho and Cuchulainn.</p><br/><p>All the others looked at Hephaestus as if requesting an answer perhaps because they thought similarly to him and Hephaestus spoke with a voice that was as blunt as his looks.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to make a scabbard that is a weapon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Herme\u2019s face contorted. To use a scabbard like a weapon? Did they have to use it as a blunt weapon?</p><br/><p>Hephaestus was always like this. He had really delicate handicraft skills but there were many times that the people in his surroundings didn\u2019t know what he was talking about.</p><br/><p>But it was a bit different this time. It was because there was the previous blacksmith God that could easily interpret Hephaestus\u2019 words.</p><br/><p>\u201cHephaestus, are you talking about a scabbard that stores strength?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hephaestus nodded immediately at Prometheus\u2019 question.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2019 right. One to kill Gods\u2026. I will make a scabbard that has the power to annihilate Gods.\u201d</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t talking about fighting with the scabbard directly. It meant that the scabbard would grant the sword the power to kill Gods.</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed. You are going to separate the function to create and store strength and the function to fight as a weapon. If you go with the function to create and store strength you won\u2019t have to worry about the durability or attack power to strike the enemy and will be able to concentrate solely on accumulating strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hephaestus nodded again at Prometheus\u2019 interpretation. It seemed like Prometheus had said everything he wanted to.</p><br/><p>\u2018So\u2026..is it like a cellphone and a charger?\u2019</p><br/><p>It was a comparison that had gone a bit astray but it seemed about right.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn let out a small exclamation.</p><br/><p>\u2018Indeed, I think I know what it is. You already have many weapons so rather than increasing the number of weapons, he\u2019s planning to make a tool to utilize all of your weapons. The God of blacksmithing indeed.\u2019</p><br/><p>The weapons Tae Ho had were such that could represent a world just like Cuchulainn and Prometheus had assured him.</p><br/><p>He already had weapons like that so it would be much more efficient to create an assisting tool rather than another weapon.</p><br/><p>Everyone started to get excited as they began to understand Hephaestus\u2019 short words. Except one person, Adenmaha, who calmly pulled on Tae Ho\u2019s sleeve and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, I think that we should end it here.\u201d</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t say anything else through mystical magic, but he could understand her intentions just by looking at her eyes. Adenmaha was worried about Hephaestus\u2019 state.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho didn\u2019t know it as Hephaestus had an unshapely look and didn\u2019t show that he was hurt, but when Tae Ho looked at Hephaestus with his \u2018eyes of the dragon\u2019, he could see that the blacksmith god was overdoing it. It would be good to make Hephaestus rest immediately.</p><br/><p>\u201cHephaestus, you have just woken up, so go rest for today. Echidna and Athena are going to come tomorrow, so I think that it will be better to speak then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for your consideration.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hephaestus answered with a smile and relaxed a bit. It seemed like he wasn\u2019t planning on lying down before Tae Ho left the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cRest. I will take care of him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha whispered while letting go of Tae Ho\u2019s sleeve, and Tae Ho stroked her head once before leaving the clinic.</p><br/><p>And around noon the next day.</p><br/><p>Athena and Echidna returned with the help of Hermes and went to the clinic along with Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cHephaestus.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really good to see you again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hephaestus smiled and answered at Athena\u2019s call. He was much better than yesterday.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why is his reaction like that? Does he like Athena?\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn spoke in a low voice as it was a bit interesting.</p><br/><p>Actually, Tae Ho and Cuchulainn didn\u2019t knowthat well but the relationship between Athena and Hephaestus was quite strange.</p><br/><p>Hephaestus fell in love with Athena from the first time he saw her and asked Zeus to give her to him as his wife. But Zeus didn\u2019t listen to his request, and Athena didn\u2019t see him in a good light because he was suddenly trying to become her husband.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why Hephaestus suffered alone and in the end went crazy after enduring it by himself for so long and tried to rape Athena.</p><br/><p>But his opponent was the Goddess of warfare Athena so one that got punished was Hephaestus.</p><br/><p>But Hephaestus\u2019 sperm fell on Athena\u2019s thigh in the middle of the quarrel and from the semen which Athena wiped off, Erichthonius was born with the body of a snake.</p><br/><p>Athena couldn\u2019t leave Erichthonius behind as he was just a baby so she raised him. After that Erichthonius became the king of Athens and offered it to Athena. That was the reason Athens became the most important city of Athena\u2019s sacred force.</p><br/><p>Hephaestus awoke from the madness and begged for forgiveness several times.</p><br/><p>Athena rejected him at first but realized that Hephaestus had been mad at the time and was repenting sincerely since then. After also taking into account Erichthonius, she decided to forgive him.</p><br/><p>After that, the 2 Gods had a really awkward relationship.</p><br/><p>\u201cI also couldn\u2019t have imagined that I would be this glad to see you Hephaestus. Thanks for having endured until now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hephaestus lowered his head with a face of embarrassment and guilt as Athena spoke to him while she laughed softly and he showed a faint smile.</p><br/><p>And Echidna, that had been looking at all of this clapped out loud.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow warm, how warm. I\u2019m sorry but why don\u2019t we introduce ourselves? I\u2019m Echidna.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreetings to the ancient dragon. I\u2019m Hephaestus.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, I like you because you are affable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Echidna liked that he used the nickname of ancient dragon instead of mother of all monsters.</p><br/><p>She then checked Hephaestus from head to toe and then asked Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, can I proceed with the talking?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs you wish.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reason he called Echidna hurriedly was because he had told her that Prometheus needed the flames of Typhon.</p><br/><p>Even if Tae Ho was the one to do the talking he still needed k Echidna\u2019s opinion about the matter so it would be better if Echidna proceeded from the beginning.</p><br/><p>Echidna laughed delightedly as Tae Ho agreed and then asked Hephaestus with a sharp tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, so you want to forge something in our territory?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Now that I can\u2019t use my smithy, I need Typhon\u2019s fire to make a weapon suitable for the master of Asgard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm\u2026. the conditions are a bit tricky but it\u2019s not impossible. I think that it will be possible if master helps.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have to help?\u201d</p><br/><p>Echidna put on an expression of disgust and shrugged her shoulders at Tae Ho\u2019s questions.</p><br/><p>\u201cI already told you before but Typhon is still alive. He will get angry like the flames if a God of Olympus enters him. They will probably die as soon as they approach the flames of Typhon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Typhon was an entity born with the fate to oppose the Gods just like the World Wolf and the Space Snake of Asgard. There was no way he would allow the Gods of Olympus to use his strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster pushed away my strength and made your territory when you fought against me right? You just need to do something similar inside of Typhon. It should be a tough job as you have to endure the rage of Typhon while forging the object, but there are no other methods besides that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018So you have to blow the bellows inside the smithy.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho nodded at Cuchulainn\u2019s interpretation.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will do it if it\u2019s necessary.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHou, I like you because you are rousing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Echidna giggled and looked at Hephaestus again.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd you, you shouldn\u2019t only need a place, right? You have to make an object suitable for the master of Asgard just like you said. It won\u2019t be enough with the ingredients humans use.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s not enough with normal ingredients. I need special ones.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow troublesome. I already checked the smithies in this place but they only have normal ingredients.\u201d</p><br/><p>The one that spoke while frowning was Prometheus.</p><br/><p>Echidna also frowned and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have amazing ingredients either. Us monsters, don\u2019t fight with weapons.\u201d</p><br/><p>They had a smithy that made tools necessary for daily life inside the city of monsters but there wasn\u2019t a smithy or a blacksmith that specialized in making weapons.</p><br/><p>Worry spread on everyone\u2019s faces. The simplest thing was to bring the ingredients from Hephaestus\u2019 smithy but the difficulty of infiltrating the base of Aphrodite and the mount of Olympus, that was ruled over by Zeus was really high.</p><br/><p>\u2018And Aphrodite was aware.\u2019</p><br/><p>Just like Cuchulainn had said, Aphrodite had closed her eyes on the infiltration of the group. It wasn\u2019t that she hadn\u2019t noticed. They had to give up on the ingredients in Hephaestus\u2019 smithy.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho thought for a while and then took out an equipment from the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cHephaestus, can you use this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe shield of Achilles\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>A flood of emotions surged onto Hephaestus\u2019 face. He treasured Achilles quite a lot as he grew under Thetis and Achilles was her son.</p><br/><p>But the shield was right in front of him and Achilles was the great hero of Zeus.</p><br/><p>The painful truth that he didn\u2019t want to admit and that anyone capable of thought could think of appeared in his head.</p><br/><p>But it was an unavoidable thing. Hephaestus shook away the unnecessary emotions and looked at the shield he made as the God of blacksmithing and then shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible. It\u2019s certainly a masterpiece that I didn\u2019t save good ingredients and hard work to make but in the end I made this only for the human Achilles. It\u2019s lacking too much to be used as an ingredient for what I\u2019m about to make.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hephaestus hadn\u2019t only thought of Poseidon. He was also taking into account Zeus, the master of Olympus. They needed a weapon to face him andthe shield of Achilles couldn\u2019t accomplish such things.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut wouldn\u2019t it be better than having nothing? We don\u2019t have anything right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, we do.\u201d</p><br/><p>The one that interrupted Hermes was Athena. When everyone turned to look at her, she took a breath while closing her eyes and then spoke to Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster of Asgard, do you remember what I promised before? It\u2019s funny to say this now\u2026 but I promised to give you a reward.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI do remember.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will keep my promise now. I was able to take over Apollo\u2019s sacred force thanks to your help\u2026.. and that\u2019s why I became able to do this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Athena amplified her divine power slowly and then a beautiful silver divinity arose from both of her hands.</p><br/><p>Athena spread her arms slowly. A shield surged up like the sun from inside the silver divinity.</p><br/><p>\u201cAegis!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hephaestus yelled. Hermes and Prometheus also gulped dry saliva and Echidna took a defensive stance by reflex.</p><br/><p>The shield of Gods Aegis.</p><br/><p>The strongest shield that was easily one of the best treasures among the ones Athena possessed.</p><br/><p>Athena raised the round silver shield that had the head of a gorgon in it and then turned to look at Hephaestus.</p><br/><p>\u201cHephaestus, how about this? It\u2019s a shield that has the strength of the God of battle Pallas and mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Athena defeated the Titan God of battle Pallas in Titanomachy then made a lump of force with his body and strength. With this Hephaestus forged it into Aegis.</p><br/><p>Just like Athena had said, they were the best of the best ingredients as it had both the power of the God of battle Pallas and the Goddess of warfare Athena.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s enough. But Athena, will it really be okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a battle to rescue Olympus. I hope my strength is of use to the master of Asgard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Athena put a bright smile without any regrets. Hephaestus, who had fallen in love with that smile of hers, couldn\u2019t say anything else.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I just kept my promise. We are the ones that are eternally grateful to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Tae Ho and Athena expressed thanks to each other, Echidna clapped again.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow warm, how warm. Anyways, you have everything now? The place, the ingredients, and the master that will forge the sheath for master.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe still need time. Hephaestus hyung-nim. How long do you think it will take?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hermes butted in and asked Hephaestus.</p><br/><p>And Hephaestus touched his beard and answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t be sure but it won\u2019t take that long. The problem is how fast will the ingredients of Aegis absorb Typhon\u2019s power.\u201d</p><br/><p>It wouldn\u2019t take that long to make the scabbard itself as the shield of Achilles had been made in only a day.</p><br/><p>Siri, who had been silent during the conversation, opened her mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Poseidon maintains his current speed\u2026. I expect that he will take one week to reach a relevant distance. We will have to give up on all the cities and villages between us and him but there won\u2019t be many sacrifices because evacuations have already taken place.\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri had been preparing with Bracky to defend against Poseidon while also surveilling him. There were no mistakes in her words.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne week is enough. It will probably end before that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Prometheus also nodded at Hephaestus\u2019 words.</p><br/><p>They now had time, place, ingredients and a blacksmith. But there was still one person who was worried.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, will you be fine?\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha pulled on Tae Ho\u2019s sleeves and asked. It was because she was worried that he had to endure Typhon\u2019s rage.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. I have to endure before Adenmaha gives me the promised reward.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm hmph.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha flushed and snorted desperately and Cuchulainn decided to leave Tae Ho alone as he dealt the final blow like a habit. It seemed like the only way was that Adenmaha had to endure it well.</p><br/><p>\u2018Anyways, it\u2019s interesting. The fire of the strongest monster of Olympus, Typhon, will be added to the power of Asgard and Erin, and on top of that the power of the Goddess of warfare Athena. And the one combining them into one is the best blacksmith God of Olympus.\u2019</p><br/><p>Erin, Olympus, Asgard.</p><br/><p>It was the birth of a weapon that was combined with the forces of the three worlds.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t need to waste more time. Let\u2019s start immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho said and Hephaestus and the others nodded.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>The passage of time was impartial to everyone.</p><br/><p>When Tae Ho\u2019s group was gathering their strength to make a new weapon, the others were also moving at the same time.</p><br/><p>Aphrodite left Cyprus, her hands trembling in rage, and headed to Poseidon. Dionysius rose up and looked at Artemis\u2019 and Apollo\u2019s sacred force.</p><br/><p>As Poseidon surged up from the sea and stepped on the ground countless voices filled his ears</p><br/><p>Go, go, sweep down everything.</p><br/><p>Poseidon said that he would do just that. He not only created countless hailstorms but also began creating a sea that would devour the land.</p><br/><p>And once again in a distant place. At the end of the world beyond the east.</p><br/><p>The greatest hero that could overwhelm even Gods started to head to the west.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/valhalla-saga-chapter-204\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 204\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/valhalla-saga-chapter-206\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 206\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"95755\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

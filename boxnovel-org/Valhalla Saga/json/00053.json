And he thought about the situation and the place he was in right now.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is it\u2026.something like a consciousness?\u2019</p><br/><p>Or a meeting or a conversation occurring in his heart, just like what commonly happened in mangas or novels.</p><br/><p>Gae Bolg had Cu Chulainn\u2019s soul in it, and that soul was talking with Tae Ho inside of his heart.</p><br/><p>Although it was all a guess, he could somewhat draw the situation in his head.</p><br/><p>In the other hand, Cu Chulainn frowned and looked at Tae Ho. Then he nodded as if he understood and put on a calm smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course the current situation should be bewildering to you. Just the fact that you are facing none other than me, the Cu Chulainn of the red branch knights. I understand that you aren\u2019t able to calm yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho couldn\u2019t react at the misunderstanding. However Cu Chulainn felt that it was also because of his nervousness that he continued speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you should calm down and receive it. You are Erin\u2019s successor that was selected by me, Cu Chulainn.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho thought what he should answer for a moment. Did he have to say that he didn\u2019t know him well just like what he did with Ragnar or did he have to pretend.</p><br/><p>\u2018Wake up, please\u2026..\u2019</p><br/><p>He heard a voice at that moment. Tae Ho flinched and looked at his surroundings. He was sure it was Heda\u2019s voice but it wasn\u2019t heard near them.</p><br/><p>From beyond the curtain.</p><br/><p>He was sure it came from outside. There was anxiousness mixed in Heda\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you\u2026..not know about me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cu Chulainn opened his eyes sharply and asked. It seemed like he was facing a person who couldn\u2019t believe what was happening.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2026.do know you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho answered and then bit his lips. Heda got on his nerves too much. He wanted to wake up a bit faster to put her on ease.</p><br/><p>But even so, he couldn\u2019t just ignore the man in front of him.</p><br/><p>Honestly speaking, he didn\u2019t know much about him. Because he had only heard the simple details from Ragnar.</p><br/><p>The strongest and greatest warrior of the destroyed world, Erin.</p><br/><p>Although it was merely a sentence, the contents of it couldn\u2019t be ignored at all.</p><br/><p>Although he didn\u2019t know well, he was sure he was a hero comparable to Ragnar.</p><br/><p>And that great hero was telling him that he would become his master. In addition, he had said that Tae Ho was the successor that would succeed everything.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m getting a feeling.\u2019</p><br/><p>With game terms, he had gotten a great hidden quest.</p><br/><p>So he had to continue speaking with him for now.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry Heda.\u2019</p><br/><p>I will finish the fastest I can and return, so wait a bit more.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho that had decided his mind took a deep breath and faced Cu Chulainn. He was putting on a confused expression but then shook his head and fixed his posture when he saw Tae Ho\u2019s attitude change.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, let\u2019s talk about me later. The time is limited\u2026.. I will speak of something more important now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The distance between Tae Ho and him closed. The two of them were facing each other behind a big tree. They were three or four steps from each other.</p><br/><p>Cu Chulainn said with a serious face.</p><br/><p>\u201cWarrior of Valhalla. I\u2019m already dead. The one in this place is the remnants of myself, that is inside of the fragment of Gae Bolg\u2026.You can call it as a soul fragment. Originally, I tried to leave all of my memories and consciousness behind but Gae Bolg got destroyed in the last moment so it turned out like it is now.</p><br/><p>Although Cu Chulainn was certainly a great warrior, he also had talent in magic that he had several mysterious magic.</p><br/><p>The reason he left behind his soul in Gae Bolg at the last moment wasn\u2019t because he was afraid of death. It was because of the responsibility resting in his shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have discovered a fragment of Gae Bolg. And Gae Bolg also recognized you. Because of that, it can be said that I also recognize you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t say that it was mere coincidence. If they weren\u2019t worthy at all, they wouldn\u2019t even have been able to discover Gae Bolg.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will become your teacher and transmit everything from Erin. So warrior of Valhalla, gather the remaining fragments of Gae Bolg from the traces of the Great War. The fragment that is with you will tell you the path.\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t only to return Gae Bolg to its original shape. There were the fragments of soul of Cu Chulainn in each fragment.</p><br/><p>Cu Chulainn was currently unstable. Just like it was a fragment, there were also defects in his memory. If he wanted to transmit everything about Erin, he would have to regain his complete memories first.</p><br/><p>Cu Chulainn looked at Tae Ho\u2019s eyes and then the scene changed.</p><br/><p>It was a battlefield. There were black spots as if there were missing holes in his memory, but he could recognize the battlefield.</p><br/><p>The Great War.</p><br/><p>The only way to express the festival of Gods.</p><br/><p>What Tae Ho witness was an explosion of a force. The great explosion didn\u2019t simply stop at destroying the geography. It didn\u2019t only destroy space but also twisted the world and made countless cracks.</p><br/><p>The battlefield that had turned to pieces followed the cracks that got made like that and scattered throughout the world.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho could realize why there was a trace of the Great War in the boundary between Asgard and Midgard, and not only in Svartalfheim.</p><br/><p>\u2018So that was why.\u2019</p><br/><p>The reason why he also discovered Garmr\u2019s soul fragment in Asgard.</p><br/><p>It was the same for the Unknown sword piece and Gae Bolg.</p><br/><p>Their surroundings changed to a plain again. Cu Chulainn grabbed Tae Ho\u2019s shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cComplete Gae Bolg. And find my master, Scathach.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, strong desire appeared in Cu Chulainn\u2019s two eyes. Tae Ho, that had seen part of his memories, could think of the cat eyed lady with black hair.</p><br/><p>Cu Chulainn loved her. However telling him to find her wasn\u2019t because of a love he couldn\u2019t fulfill. It was for a real completion.</p><br/><p>The day Erin got destroyed, many things got destroyed along it. Even the last survivor of the red branch knights, Cu Chulainn, could be said as the successor of everything left. But he hadn\u2019t really received everything.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet the teachings of my teacher. Then you will be able to succeed Milesians and Tuatha De Danann.\u201d</p><br/><p>Milesians and Tuatha De Dannan.</p><br/><p>It was the first time Tae Ho heard those words, but he could vaguely know what they were because of Cu Chulainn\u2019s memories.</p><br/><p>The race that could be called as the owners of the destroyed Erin, Tuatha De Danann and their Gods.</p><br/><p>And the strong human race, the Milesians, that drove Tuatha De Danann to the underground.</p><br/><p>The only thing Cu Chulainn could transmit was the power of the Milesians.</p><br/><p>To receive the power of Tuatha De Danann he needed the assistance of the queen of the land of darkness.</p><br/><p>Their surroundings changed again. It was the world filled with darkness.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have time anymore. I will wait for our next meeting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cu Chulainn looked at the sky with dim eyes. Tae Ho could hear Heda\u2019s voice that was interrupted.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I can\u2019t just leave the successor I have just met empty handed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cu Chulainn laughed and then grabbed Tae Ho\u2019s hands. Tae Ho looked at him reflexively and flinched. It was because he had closed the distance in an instant and placed his lips on Tae Ho\u2019s forehead.</p><br/><p>It was certainly a blessing. No, it had to be.</p><br/><p>Cu Chulainn looked at Tae Ho that was bewildered and then smiled as if he was also bothered so he let go of Tae Ho\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cErin\u2019s strength will accompany you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cu Chulainn was covered in darkness. Tae Ho also closed his eyes. He could hear Heda\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho!\u201d</p><br/><p>He opened his eyes. Then let out a breath. Heda was right in front of him.</p><br/><p>Even though she was crying she was still pretty. Her golden eyes were brilliant but sad as the morning glory.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeda.\u201d</p><br/><p>He let out his voice. And then Heda\u2019s face distorted. He started to smile and then embraced Tae Ho\u2019s head strongly.</p><br/><p>It would have been nice if he felt something soft and warm, but it was hard because of the armor and it hurt. However Tae Ho let out a small smile. Even though he didn\u2019t have strength and it hurt, he realized that he was alive. Looking that the senses were returning to his body, it seemed like Heda had given him a piece of a golden apple while he was speaking with Cu Chulainn.</p><br/><p>\u2018Wait, how did she feed me?\u2019</p><br/><p>He must have lost consciousness and wouldn\u2019t have been able to chew properly.</p><br/><p>There was something he remembered. Perhaps it may be his body remembering it. However he couldn\u2019t remember how it felt. He just felt that it was unfortunate.</p><br/><p>Babang!</p><br/><p>Right then the world got dyed in white along a thunder. The transparent barrier that was covering Heda and Tae Ho shook violently. Heda embraced Tae Ho even tighter and Tae Ho could somewhat realize the situation they were in while being pressed with the armor.</p><br/><p>The God of Thunder, Thor. He was executing his last attack to the giant of strength Harad with the strongest weapon in Asgard, Mjolnir.</p><br/><p>The thunder ripped off the darkness and the fire.</p><br/><p>The sound of the thunder faded away. As the world found its light again, Heda slowly let Tae Ho go. She looked at a distant place and then put a bright smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cThor will come. Ragnar is also safe.\u201d</p><br/><p>He wanted to ask about Bracky but his lips didn\u2019t open. It seemed like he was really exhausted.</p><br/><p>\u2018Rolo\u2026..should also be fine right?\u2019</p><br/><p>Thinking about it, they had gotten swept by all of this when they had come to obtain Rolo.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho let out a sigh of relief. Although he felt sorry for Rolo, it meant that the situation was so chaotic it made him have such thoughts.</p><br/><p>The surroundings turned quiet.</p><br/><p>A thunder exploded out just like the storm after the calm and then it seemed like even the wind was silent.</p><br/><p>However that didn\u2019t last long. It was because the cheers of the warriors of Valhalla was heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cThor!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThor!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGod of Thunder!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFather!\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at the last shout it seemed like Bracky was also fine.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad. Really glad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda smiled brightly after speaking in a low voice and then placed her lips on his forehead again. It was to give him the blessing of a Valkyrie.</p><br/><p>But it was at that moment. The moment Heda placed her lips on his forehead she flinched and trembled, and then blinked with a surprised face.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t because she felt the scent of an unfamiliar man from Tae Ho\u2019s forehead. It was because he felt something strong that was added on top of the blessing of a Valkyrie.</p><br/><p>And Tae Ho could also know. What Cu Chulainn gave wasn\u2019t a simple blessing.</p><br/><p>\u2018Because I can\u2019t leave you empty handed.\u2019</p><br/><p>The thing he left, what he transmitted to Tae Ho.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cu Chulainn didn\u2019t speak empty words. He really passed over Erin\u2019s power to him.</p><br/><p>Geass.</p><br/><p>Erin\u2019s power that was comparable to Asgard\u2019s power.</p><br/><p>Heda turned her head again. Ragnar and Thor were approaching.</p><br/><p>&lt; The God of Thunder (2) &gt; End</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He hurriedly extended his arms and stopped Heda and then calmly checked Tae Ho\u2019s state. Tae Ho was standing with a surprised expression while still holding onto the fragment of equipment. He seemed to be more surprised at Ragnar\u2019s shout rather than the light of the fragment.</p><br/><p>However, Ragnar pushed Heda and then asked as if he was relieved.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you okay? Your strength didn\u2019t get sucked into the fragment or anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhew.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar let out a sigh of relief and then released Heda. She realized that Tae Ho was fine and then asked a bit quickly.</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho, did you see something?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA\u2026.Memory. From the owner of this spear.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho started to think back and answered slowly. Then Ragnar opened his eyes sharply.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said it was Gae Bolg?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure. Gae Bolg.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was certain because he could still read the rainbow colored words through the eyes of the dragon.</p><br/><p>[Gae Bolg\u2019s fragment]</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t an unknown equipment anymore. Tae Ho knew the name of the weapon.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy God, it was a weapon of Cu Chulainn.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar said with a voice that was filled with excitement and exclamation. Tae Ho asked Ragnar.</p><br/><p>\u201cRagnar, just who is Cu Chulainn?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he did remember something, it was too short. Because for Tae Ho, Cu Chulainn and Gae Bolg were completely unfamiliar existences.</p><br/><p>However, that didn\u2019t seem to be the case for Ragnar and Heda. The two people, especially Ragnar, put on a bewildered face and then let out a sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, you were this kind of bastard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because he didn\u2019t even know about Ragnar.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe was a warrior that was called to be the strongest in Erin\u2026.and now the destroyed planet. If you were to compare him to someone in Valhalla, he would be like Sigurd.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigurd\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>He did hear that he was one of the strongest warriors in Valhalla. If he was at a level that he could massacre tens of dragons, then it was understandable for Heda and Ragnar to show those expressions. Because he was so famous his name spread even on Valhalla.</p><br/><p>Ragnar calmed himself a bit and then looked at the fragment of Gae Bolg that was in Tae Ho\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cGae Bolg is the strongest weapon among the ones Cu Chulainn had. It was made by the monarch of the land of shadow, Scathach, with the bones of a sea creature. It\u2019s also the first time I see it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScathach\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>He had certainly heard that name in the memory of the man.</p><br/><p>She was the owner of the fortress that was surrounded by seven layers of walls and nine wooden fences. The only woman Cu Chulainn loved more than himself and his teacher.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho closed his eyes and tried to think of Scathach\u2019s face. Cu Chulainn thought of her until the end, without letting go of his spear. Because of that, he could remember her face too clearly.</p><br/><p>The lady with cat-like eyes. The queen of the land of darkness that only showed a kind smile to Cu Chulainn.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s really Gae Bolg, it\u2019s understandable that your saga doesn\u2019t work.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar said in a low voice. After he stopped talking, Tae Ho opened his eyes and continued to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt should be that it doesn\u2019t allow you. To take the shape of another weapon even if it\u2019s temporary. Gae Bolg is a weapon of that caliber.\u201d</p><br/><p>It couldn\u2019t tolerate over putting the shape of another weapon in it.</p><br/><p>This was something that could happen if this weapon belonged to a warrior that represented a whole world.</p><br/><p>However, Heda spoke with a careful tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all a probability. Don\u2019t try your saga on Gae Bolg for now. Perhaps, it may not be something like permission but it may have a strong geass in it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGeass?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar explained immediately at the word he heard for the first time.</p><br/><p>\u201cGeass means pledge. It\u2019s the strength in Erin, just like the sagas in Valhalla. You obtain a strength instead of pledging something with a restriction.\u201d</p><br/><p>Each world had a magic that represented it.</p><br/><p>Erin\u2019s geass was a power as strong as Valhalla\u2019s saga.</p><br/><p>\u201cCu Chulainn possessed several geasses, just like the strongest warrior. And among them, there are some that become stronger when the owner dies, so you have to be careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>A geass was a two-edged blade. It gave you a strong force instead of putting you a restriction, however when you ignored the pledge you had to face a punishment that was greater than the strength you obtained through it. Because of that, a strong geass was compared to a strong curse.</p><br/><p>However, Tae Ho couldn\u2019t feel any sort of evil in this fragment of Gae Bolg. It seemed like that was also the case for Ragnar that he pointed another thing instead of the danger of the geass.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough it\u2019s only a fragment, if it\u2019s Gae Bolg it should be strong enough in this state. And honestly speaking, it\u2019s too excessive for the current you. You can say that it\u2019s a weapon you can\u2019t be sure you can cope with it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar wasn\u2019t planning on taking the fragment from Tae Ho. But even so, it wasn\u2019t that he was going to leave it alone.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s not a really important moment, don\u2019t try to use it. Think of it as the last card you can take out before you grow up enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Tae Ho answered seriously, Ragnar nodded satisfactorily and then loosened his expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst of all, if this spear is really Gae Bolg\u2026..There\u2019s a high possibility for that Sword piece, so to say that hilt is also a weapon from Erin.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was quite a logical guess. However, Heda shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not certain. If it\u2019s just like Tae Ho said, It just reacted after seeing Gae Bolg. That doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s from the same world, but it recognized Gae Bolg and told Tae Ho.\u201d</p><br/><p>This side also had some possibilities.</p><br/><p>Although he wanted to just ask the sword piece directly, after he got out of the trace of the Great War, the sword piece was just silent.</p><br/><p>Because of that Ragnar continued to guess something not certain.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, if it\u2019s really a weapon from Erin\u2026.there\u2019s a high possibility for it to be Caladbolg or Excalibur\u2026.What\u2019s wrong with your expression?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar looked at Tae Ho and Tae Ho yelled inwardly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Excalibur!\u2019</p><br/><p>Although he didn\u2019t know about Caladbolg, he did know about Excalibur. Wasn\u2019t that the most famous and legendary sword in his world?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean the Excalibur of the legends from King Arthur, right? The thing that was stuck in a rock.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you do know about King Arthur\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar said with lukewarm eyes. Although his face showed that he was really discontent, looking at his expression it seemed like it really was the Excalibur he knew about.</p><br/><p>\u201cErin has already been destroyed. As countless legendary weapons disappeared along with their owners\u2026.Even if the weapon of Arthur Pendragon appears there would be nothing strange about that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut it is a bit weird.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda stepped in. She looked at Tae Ho and Ragnar and then shrugged her shoulders and explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it really is Caladbolg or Excalibur, it means that it\u2019s almost at the same level as Gae Bolg. But Gae Bolg rejected transforming into another weapon but this sword piece is accepting Tae Ho\u2019s saga.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, perhaps it may be at a lower level than Gae Bolg. Or it has no pride.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRagnar.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Ragnar said while smirking, Heda looked at him as if he was hopeless and Tae Ho also butted in.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not low ranked. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s the same rank as Gae Bolg.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because the two of them were rainbow colored. In addition, the both of them didn\u2019t lose in brightness.</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps it may have a good temperament. Or it really likes you Tae Ho.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda suggested a new probability. Looking that it could answer with yes and no in the trace of the Great War, they were sure that it had some ego so it wasn\u2019t baseless words.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho looked at the sword piece in a new light. Because if it really had an ega like Heda had said, it was a really thankful fellow. Because even if it was at the same rank as Gae Bolg, it was lending its strength to Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>Ragnar said in a serious voice again.</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho, listen well. There\u2019s no coincidence in a meeting with a weapon. The reason why you have met with the sword piece and obtained Gae Bolg\u2019s fragment was that you were fated. It could be said that it was a strong attraction. Perhaps, you may meet more fragments of other pieces of equipment.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a high probability for fragments of pieces of equipment to be scattered in the world like Garmr\u2019s soul fragment.</p><br/><p>\u201cA fragment of Gae Bolg and the sword piece. The both of them are now yours. However, don\u2019t get swayed by the weapons. And don\u2019t even count in luck. Grow strong enough so that the two weapons become suitable for you. Understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho replied sincerely. Maybe it was because he had seen Cu Chulainn\u2019s memories that he could feel the weight in Ragnar\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, you can go to rest as we have finished the classifications. You don\u2019t look good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda clapped and turned the mood to a good one. Although she was smiling, you could see that she was worried about Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that I see, I am a bit sleepy.\u201d</p><br/><p>He did feel great exhaustion. This also seemed to be an aftershock of having seen through Cu Chulainn\u2019s memories.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will deliver the weapons of the Great War. You should rest for now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Heda. For helping me with everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda smiled brightly as Tae Ho expressed his gratitude.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is also the task of a legion\u2019s Valkyrie.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven so.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI also helped. I helped.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar interrupted with an indisposed face and Heda laughed and started to load the weapons in the wooden boat that had arrived.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>He did remember until he closed his eyes, but he didn\u2019t remember anything else after that. He had slept without dreaming of anything.</p><br/><p>It seemed like he had slept well that his eyes also opened rather easily.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou woke up?\u201d</p><br/><p>As he turned to look, he could see Ragnar reading a book next to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd Heda?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar started to laugh at Tae Ho\u2019s question and then pointed outside the door with his chin.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s outside, it\u2019s because of some guests. You woke up at the right moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGuests?\u201d</p><br/><p>No one else aside of Ragnar had come to Idun\u2019s legions residence. Tae Ho blinked and then raised his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, are they perhaps warriors of Idun\u2019s legion\u2026..so my superiors?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry but no. However, they are good guests for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar looked at the book he was reading and then pointed at the basin.</p><br/><p>\u201cWash yourself and go. You will know then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho finished washing his face roughly and then got out of his lodging. He could see Heda standing in the wooden dock without having to search for long.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeda?\u201d</p><br/><p>There were quite big wooden boxes lined up next to her. Tae Ho asked naturally after getting closer.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid packages arrive?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPackages? Ah, it came from the other legions. Reciprocal gifts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho tilted his head as if he didn\u2019t understand but then said.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really came.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was in doubt but for it to really come. Tae Ho looked at the lined up boxes. Each of them had a symbol of a legion in the lid or a name engraved on it.</p><br/><p>\u2018Wait a moment. That\u2019s from Odin\u2019s legion, that\u2019s Thors\u2026\u2026.\u2019</p><br/><p>While he was reading them one by one he heard the sound of a bell. He raised his head as he thought that it was a dispatch order but then Heda shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the signal of a ship approaching.\u201d</p><br/><p>A big ship was really approaching from far away. There was the sculpture of a big wolf at the front.</p><br/><p>\u201cUllr\u2019s legion.\u201d</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t see any boxes belonging to Ullr\u2019s legion. As the big ship anchored down, Heda said with a surprised face.</p><br/><p>\u201cGandur? You yourself came here?\u201d</p><br/><p>She had her doubts when she saw a big ship, but for a real Valkyrie to come. Gandur snickered and waved her hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cNice to meet you, Heda. And also, warrior Tae Ho. I came to keep the promise.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you when you defeated the regenerator? That I will tell Ullr-nim about your merits. I put in more thought into the gift.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gandur spoke up to there and jumped down the ship. Followed by her, a familiar warrior jumped down with a big sack.</p><br/><p>\u201cCaptain Siri.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo this is the residence of Idun\u2019s legion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri started to check her surroundings slowly after landing. It seemed like it was quite different to Ullr\u2019s legion that she was amazed.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho approached her and then threw a joke.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you going to move to our legion?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it. I came to help Gandur-nim. I also wanted to see how the other residences looked.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be like that Tae Ho and come to our legion. I will get you a partner and also Siri. And I will also get you a wing coat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gandur said hurriedly. Looking that she was looking at him with expectant eyes, it seemed like she still hadn\u2019t given up on taking him to Ullr\u2019s legion.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m also okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda and Siri answered instead of Tae Ho. Siri had especially cold eyes as if she felt betrayed by the words partner and wing coat.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways, this is the gift.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gandur changed subjects impudently and then gave Tae Ho the sack Siri was holding.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a stealth cloak. You do know about the stealth blessing right?\u201d</p><br/><p>He obviously knew. As Tae Ho nodded, a vague smile appeared on Gandur\u2019s face again.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou will be able to use the stealth blessing when you wear it. And it\u2019s also a high leveled one at that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The stealth blessing had many uses. Heda was also happy as Tae Ho became sincerely happy, however, she turned to glare at Gandur.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s a bait in the end. In the end, the members of Ullr\u2019s legion can all use the stealth blessing.\u2019</p><br/><p>That was right. Looking at it from the perspective of another legion, it was indeed a treasure. But you couldn\u2019t call it that way inside of Ullr\u2019s legion.</p><br/><p>As Gandur became aware of Heda\u2019s eyes, she also answered with her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s useful anyways. That\u2019s enough. In addition, doesn\u2019t warrior Tae Ho like it?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, it is indeed useful.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Right, and in addition that isn\u2019t all.\u2019</p><br/><p>Gandur turned her eyes to Tae Ho and then took out a silvery rope from the sack.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd this is a hunter\u2019s rope.\u201d</p><br/><p>The tip of it was roundly tied up. Looking at it made you think of the ropes that cowboys had on them.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough it\u2019s lower ranked than the cloak of stealth, it will be useful to you. If you tighten the neck with it, the strength and resistance of your prey will weaken. It\u2019s a good item to catch a monster alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was going to go catch a wild gryphon. To use it as a mount.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA wild gryphon? Do you know where they appear?\u201d</p><br/><p>The last one that spoke was Siri. Tae Ho nodded and answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cRagnar knows.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRagnar-nim?\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri\u2019s eyes started to shine. Tae Ho remembered something when he looked at Siri and then asked Gandur.</p><br/><p>\u201cGandur, looking that she hasn\u2019t returned to Svartalfheim, is captain Siri on a break?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, she rendered many merits. So compared to me, that has to return to the scene, Siri is on a temporary break.\u201d</p><br/><p>Compared to Idun\u2019s legion, as there were many people in Ullr\u2019s legion on standby, there was no need to be worried about when they would get called.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho looked at Siri again and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cCaptain Siri, do you want to go with us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo catch a wild gryphon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Ragnar will also come.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar treated Siri and the warriors of Ullr\u2019s legion with delight. He wasn\u2019t someone that would mind about one more companion.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith, with Ragnar-nim?\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri\u2019s voice trembled. Siri turned to look at Gandur when Tae Ho gave the nod. At her eyes that were begging for permission earnestly, Gandur laughed pleasingly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI allow it. An opportunity to accompany someone like Ragnar is rare. If you can catch a wild gryphon, it will also be of big helpt to Ullr\u2019s legion.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri smiled brightly. She had the face of a girl that received a concert ticket of the idols she liked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Tae Ho.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m the one that should be thankful.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the end, Tae Ho was the one paying off the debts to her by telling her to accompany them. Although it was in battle and had taken into account the effectivity of it, Siri had let Tae Ho ride on him without any complaints.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho still couldn\u2019t forget when she wore the wing coat and chanted when she wanted to fight along the warriors of the Great War.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s about what happened on the battlefield, don\u2019t let it affect you too much. If you need it from now on, I will wear a wing coat how many times you want.\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri said with a bitter smile. It wasn\u2019t because Tae Ho had let her come with them but it was her sincere feelings.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri was really a warrior of Valhalla. As Tae Ho expressed his gratitude, Siri shrugged her shoulders as if it was embarrassing.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then Heda let out a small voice. Thanks to that, Tae Ho realized that there was one more person to ask to and then hurriedly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cSaid, you are fine with captain Siri coming with us, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that she can\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although she didn\u2019t allow her as pleasantly as Gandur, it was still a permission.</p><br/><p>Gandur forced her smile and asked Heda.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeda, when are you departing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTomorrow morning.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I will come tomorrow with Siri. As there are many people, we will go to the hall with our ship.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because the wooden boat of Idun\u2019s legion was too small.</p><br/><p>It seemed like Heda had realized the meaning behind that, that she glared at Gandur and Gandur urged Siri and got on the ship.</p><br/><p>And the next day.</p><br/><p>The ship of Ullr\u2019s legion arrived in Idun\u2019s legion one more time.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 15 \u2013 Alpha Male (1) &gt; End</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/valhalla-saga-chapter-46\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 46\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/valhalla-saga-chapter-48\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 48\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"95311\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

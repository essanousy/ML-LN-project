What kind of bullshit he was about to spout in front of him, the master of Olympus.</p><br/><p>But Zeus waited for the moment. But Odin didn\u2019t even feel shame of that wait and said out loud the words Zeus was thinking about.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have to give up Olympus.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lightning struck. The lightning that got fired swept the surroundings of the throne of Zeus. The place Odin was standing at was no exception. The barrier Odin had prepared with rune magic beforehand clashed with the lightning. Loud explosions and light flashed a few times but the rage of Zeus didn\u2019t get eased easily.</p><br/><p>But Odin stood still to wait for Zeus to regain his composure. Even Zeus couldn\u2019t know if that shameless attitude helped him recover his mind or made him more enraged.</p><br/><p>The lightning disappeared. Zeus drooped his body in the half-destroyed throne. He sent back the Gods that came running surprised because of the loud sound with a gesture of his hand and looked at Odin.</p><br/><p>\u201cKeep spouting\u2026no, speak.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeus knew Odin as much as Odin knew him. He wasn\u2019t someone that would proceed with things without any plans.</p><br/><p>Odin turned to look at the only Goddess that had remained behind without listening to Zeus while all the other Gods left at his word. The queen of Gods Hera stood next to Zeus\u2019 throne as she also had the right to listen.</p><br/><p>Odin looked at Hera\u2019s movement for a moment and then looked at Zeus again. He was really exhausted right now and Odin understood that.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will give up on Olympus just like I said before. We will evacuate everyone from Olympus to Asgard and then seal the connecting path to trap the newly born Path of fire of the Kingdom of Fire in Olympus. It won\u2019t last that long but we will be able to buy some time.\u201d</p><br/><p>The story became a bit long but in the end it meant that they would be giving up Olympus. No, it was worse than that. It meant that they were going to sacrifice all of Olympus to tie down the enemy.</p><br/><p>Zeus clenched the handle in his throne. It wasn\u2019t intentional but the handle that got caught in his hands got destroyed. Zeus wanted to curse right now.</p><br/><p>Zeus wanted to yell him asking if he was able to say the same words even if the place the enemy charged to wasn\u2019t Olympus but Asgard, if he was able to stay calm even if he had to tie the enemy down in Asgard and escape to Olympus in that moment.</p><br/><p>But Zeus didn\u2019t yell like that in the end. He looked at Odin\u2019s only eye that didn\u2019t change since they started talking.</p><br/><p>If it wasn\u2019t Olympus but Asgard.</p><br/><p>Odin would have gladly said that they would give up Asgard. The one in front of him was someone that could throw away the seat of master and of course his own life if it was to win. Compared to Zeus, he was a God of war.</p><br/><p>Zeus took a breath and released the handle. The dust that got created from the debris of the handle fell to the ground.</p><br/><p>He managed to squeeze out a voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore they come to Asgard\u2026 what will happen in Olympus before the connecting path gets opened up by force?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOlympus will get destroyed. Perhaps, it may face the same fate as Erin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Odin spoke calmly. No, actually that wasn\u2019t being calm. It was the cool-headedness and cruelty of the one that proceeded with things even though he knew that countless beings were going to be sacrificed and that he also treated them as beings more than numbers.</p><br/><p>Odin\u2019s voice was different from usual. He was also squeezing out his voice. His throat was closed.</p><br/><p>But regardless of that Odin continued to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are in a hurry here. We have to preserve a little bit more of the divine power of the Gods of Olympus that rely on their sacred forces so we can\u2019t only evacuate the Gods. We also have to evacuate the Olympians to Asgard. But the Kingdom of Fire won\u2019t just stay still to watch.\u201d</p><br/><p>Odin hadn\u2019t simply said that he would give up on Olympus to evacuate people. It was to have the final battle at Olympus.</p><br/><p>The Gods of Olympus that lost their sacred force and became weak weren\u2019t of help. That\u2019s why they had to preserve at least a little bit more of their divine power and to do that, they had to succeed in an evacuation that transcended imagination.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s fortunate is that the newly born Path of flames is still being born\u2026no, it\u2019s transforming. It won\u2019t move immediately so we still have time.\u201d</p><br/><p>None other than Surtr and Anjra Mainiuu were the ones becoming one. There was no way that process would finish in an instant.</p><br/><p>\u201cOdin, can\u2019t we fight in the mount of Olympus?\u201d</p><br/><p>The silent Hera asked with a low voice. Her voice wasn\u2019t at peace at all. It contained uneasiness and fear that she couldn\u2019t hide. But her voice didn\u2019t tremble. She didn\u2019t lose her calmness even though she was in fear. She waited for Odin\u2019s reply that she already knew the answer of.</p><br/><p>Odin closed his only eye. He didn\u2019t get annoyed at Hera that asked that question even though she was expecting what he would answer. He rather understood her. They needed an exchange of question and answer to be able to take in Odin\u2019s cruel proposal.</p><br/><p>Odin opened his eye again and faced Hera looking at him while standing next to Zeus. She was beautiful and lofty. Her eyes and each of her movements made Odin think of one person.</p><br/><p>Frigg.</p><br/><p>Odin\u2019s wife. His other half that he lost at the Great War.</p><br/><p>Odin opened his mouth. He started speaking with difficulty but without pausing as much as he thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t able to defeat them just with our strength. We have to gather all the forces we have in one place. It would be good if we are able to fight at Olympus but there\u2019s a high possibility we will get defeated one by one before we take complete preparations to fight.\u201d</p><br/><p>This time Hera was the one to close her eyes. A groan she couldn\u2019t suppress came out of her mouth.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t know about war that much but she could know why Odin was speaking like that.</p><br/><p>\u201cZeus.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hera called Zeus. She extended her hand and grabbed Zeus\u2019 hand and then Zeus put a sad smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will do as you say Odin. We will give up on Olympus and prepare for the decisive battle at Asgard.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was the only method they could choose right now.</p><br/><p>They had to evacuate at least one more Olympian just like Odin had said so they had to move immediately.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Odin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeus called out Odin and looked at his only eye. He wished Odin\u2019s eyes were filled with wisdom which he obtained as a price for having offered one of his eye and life at the World tree and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo we have a way?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Path of flames that was being born at the west wasn\u2019t normal. It wasn\u2019t something that could be faced simply by having Olympus and Asgard join hands.</p><br/><p>Odin closed his eye at Zeus\u2019 question. He raised his big hand and pressed the surroundings of his eye. He opened his eye again after a few seconds that felt too long passed. He spoke to Zeus.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have thought of one thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>Freya was seated at the throne of the Gods while wearing Brisingamen.</p><br/><p>Now that Odin and Tae Ho were absent, the only one that was allowed to seat in the throne was Freya.</p><br/><p>Freya took some breaths and then touched Brisingamen. The most beautiful accessory in Asgard that was like her symbol still released a noble light but it was only that. It couldn\u2019t completely calm down Freya.</p><br/><p>But she continued to stroke it. It was because she felt like she would bite her own fingers if she didn\u2019t do at least that.</p><br/><p>Ragnar, that was standing next to Freya, didn\u2019t say anything for her sake. He just looked at the closed doors and waited.</p><br/><p>How much time passed like that?</p><br/><p>Busy noises were heard outside. It seemed like they had finally arrived.</p><br/><p>The Valkyries that were on hold outside opened the door and a few of them entered the room. Most of them were Valkyries of Freya\u2019s legion but two of them belonged to other legions.</p><br/><p>\u201cRasgrid.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Asgard and the nine realms.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Freya spoke in a hurry, Rasgrid and the Valkyries that were next to her-Gandur from Ullr\u2019s legion and Ingrid of Njord\u2019s legion, expressed etiquette. The faces of all three of them were red and they were soaked in sweat. It was clear they had run all the way here without taking a rest once.</p><br/><p>\u201cOdin has told us to tell you this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her news wasn\u2019t that long.</p><br/><p>Anjra Mainiuu and the giant of fire Surtr became one. They are going to start the evacuation of Olympus now. The Olympians will move in a huge scale so prepare a method to accommodate them and also dispatch forces to Olympus to help with the evacuation. We also have to transmit the situation to the Temple. Gandur and Ingrid know of the details as they will be the ones to go there.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Freya asked back hurriedly, Rasgrid gulped dry saliva unconsciously. She faced Freya\u2019s eyes that seemed like she would devour her at any moment and then opened her mouth with difficulty.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe says that if something is to happen to him\u2026that he would be leaving Asgard to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamned old bastard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya gritted her teeth. This was the reason she wanted to stay behind in Olympus until the end. She now refused to take the waiting role.</p><br/><p>Freya\u2019s eyes reddened. Then, the silent Gandur, poked the side of Ingrid. It seemed like she was urging her for something.</p><br/><p>\u201cA, and he also told me to tell you this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ingrid flinched as Freya asked sharply. She smacked her lips a few times and barely managed to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cO,Odin\u2026 sa, says that he loves you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ingrid spoke with a completely red face. At that moment Freya put a dumbfounded expression and then hit the handle of her throne.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me laugh! Tell him to say that kind of thing directly when he returns. I will never forgive him if he doesn\u2019t return!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ingrid also felt the same way. He should have just sent a countersignature.</p><br/><p>When Gandur was desperately holding back her laughter, Freya barely regained her composure and moved her fingers. She also used magic to cool her heat and spoke to the Valkyries.</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand the general situation. So we will have the decisive battle at Asgard. This is something that old bastard would think of.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reason Odin stayed back in Olympus was to not drag the devastations of war to Asgard.</p><br/><p>But if that Odin chose to have Asgard as the place that would have the decisive battle meant that the situation was that serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cRasgrid, you have done well. Rest for a moment before returning to Olympus. Gandur and Ingrid, i\u2019m sorry but you must hurry. I hope you depart to the Temple immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>The three Valkyries expressed etiquette at the same time. Freya regained her calm completely and looked at Ragnar.</p><br/><p>\u201cRagnar.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will take the command of the forces heading to Olympus.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar spoke while smiling. A smile also spread in Freya\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will leave it to you. And\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can also leave Odin-nim to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>They needed leisure at situations like these. Ragnar winked towards her and Freya smacked her lips.</p><br/><p>She turned to look at the Valkyries of Freya\u2019s legion and ordered them as the queen of Gods.</p><br/><p>\u201cCall Heimdall.\u201d</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t the time to be protecting Bifrost. They should gather all the Gods of Asgard in one place and prepare for many more things.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell him to bring Gjallarhorn.\u201d</p><br/><p>As the last war, Ragnarok has started.</p><br/><p>The Valkyries followed her order immediately. Ragnar also left the throne room.</p><br/><p>When Freya was left alone she looked at the west for a moment where Olympus was at. And then turned to look at the east where the Temple was located.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t have that much time.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have to take care of Daji first.\u201d</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 71 \u2013 Asgard (1) &gt; End</p><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/>\n</div>"}

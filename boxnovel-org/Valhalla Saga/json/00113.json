Secondly, they needed to think of or call out the item they wanted, and lastly, they then had to take out the item itself.</p><br/><p>The last two weren\u2019t that bad, but the process of opening the pocket unexpectedly took a lot of time. Of course, it could be done in a mere second or two, but those seconds could determine one\u2019s life or death in battle.</p><br/><p>In contrast to that, someone only needed two motions to retrieve an item from the inventory saga.</p><br/><p>Simply think of the desired item and then take it out.</p><br/><p>Then again, Tae Ho couldn\u2019t always maintain the saga, so he would have to activate it beforehand.</p><br/><p>As a fix, he could just activate it before a fight.</p><br/><p>\u2018Does it have to develop a bit more for it to get predetermined keys?\u2019</p><br/><p>In Dark Age, it was possible to bind a key to each piece of equipment and change one\u2019s weapon and armor in an instant.</p><br/><p>It seemed like it wasn\u2019t possible yet, but if it did become so, the utility of the weapons would increase severalfold as Tae Ho would be able to take out a suitable weapon for each situation.</p><br/><p>\u2018Just like Ragnar said, it\u2019s really a cheat. On top of that, the sentence of the Milesians will be added.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn spoke as if it was absurd. He could merely listen to the stories of the weapons right now as he lacked in training, but if he developed it well, he would be able to handle the weapons freely just like how the Knights of the Round Table could.</p><br/><p>In addition, Tae Ho could activate it instantly and even if the comprehension of a weapon reached the peak, he still had the \u2018Warrior\u2019s Equipment\u2019. Precisely speaking, the weapons belonging to the Dragon Knight, Kalsted.</p><br/><p>\u2018Won\u2019t you be able to control legendary weapons and fight like it\u2019s nothing?\u2019</p><br/><p>Thinking about it, it wasn\u2019t that it was impossible. He already had ten weapons that would appear in legends.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn spoke as if he was rather excited, and then Tae Ho turned back to the conversation with Ragnar once again.</p><br/><p>It was because he still had some questions he wanted to ask.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Ragnar, how is the situation in the residence? Nothing bad happened to Idun-nim, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar was a warrior of Odin instead of Idun, but actually, it wouldn\u2019t be weird to say that he was a member of the residence.</p><br/><p>Ragnar tilted his head at his question and answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t particularly get a call from Heda. Did something happen to Idun-nim?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026..I can\u2019t feel Idun-nim well, even when I use \u2018Idun\u2019s Warrior\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho explained the situation in a bit more detail. He could feel the power of Idun when he fought against Balgad, but when he was escaping from the monsters, it became more difficult to sense her even more so than when he was in Midgard behind the Great Barrier.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, she will be fine as Heda didn\u2019t contact us, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Tae Ho asked as if he wanted Ragnar to agree, the latter nodded slowly.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026.Right, there should be nothing wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>He felt a bit uneasy as Ragnar didn\u2019t answer immediately, but it wasn\u2019t a negative answer either way, so Tae Ho decided to be at ease.</p><br/><p>Ragnar spoke again.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought you would be curious, so I will tell you that there isn\u2019t any abnormality in Midgard. They were a bit bewildered after you disappeared suddenly.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed like Rasgrid had held several ceremonies to ask the situation of Tae Ho\u2019s group.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho thought of the deaths of the warriors of Valhalla in the battle against Balgad. They would all become Steel Warriors, but he couldn\u2019t help but feel a bit sad.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho organized his thoughts for a moment and then raised his head. As Ragnar asked if something was wrong, Tae Ho took out the fragment of Garmr\u2019s soul from Unnir instead of answering.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got this.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fragment of Garmr\u2019s soul which he retrieved after defeating Korga.</p><br/><p>He had forgotten about it as the battle against Balgad was really big, but looking at the entirety of Asgard, this was also an important thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt becomes even more rewarding for me to have saved you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar smiled with a satisfied face and then extended his hand towards Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cGive it to me for now. I will pass it to the upper ranks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because he would be handling all the tedious things.</p><br/><p>Ragnar received the soul fragment from Tae Ho and then stood up.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, we have put off the urgent fire for now so rest. You just have to return to the residence now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho nodded and at the same time, a reply came from his stomach.</p><br/><p><i>..rumble\u2026</i></p><br/><p>Tae Ho blinked at the honest sound, and Ragnar laughed and then pointed outside the room with his chin.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had starved for three days so to say.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho hurriedly stood up.</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cOh! Tae Ho! Over here!\u201d</p><br/><p>A big restaurant appeared as Ragnar led Tae Ho into the unfamiliar hall. The place was almost empty since it wasn\u2019t the usual mealtime, but Bracky, who was seated comfortably in a corner, yelled as soon as Tae Ho entered.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho turned to look at him and then spotted Siri and Ingrid with him. It seemed like they were just about to eat, for there was a lot of steaming, hot food placed in the table.</p><br/><p>As Tae Ho approached the group, Bracky hit next to his side and Siri moved a bit sideways to make a seat form Ragnar.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you all fine?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomewhat. Are you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomewhat too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho answered Bracky\u2019s question and then checked on Siri and Ingrid quickly with his \u2018Eyes of the Dragon\u2019. There didn\u2019t seem to be any abnormalities on the two of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about Merlin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe got called by the Valkyries. It seems like they want to discuss Erin\u2019s gate and other things with him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Excluding Tae Ho, he was the only one that had witnessed everything from start to end. In addition, Merlin was a great magician that had the ability to interpret what had happened to the group, so there could unavoidably be many things to talk about.</p><br/><p>\u201cWarrior Tae Ho, I heard the general story from Merlin. I express respect to your performance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ingrid spoke with her business-like face and then stood up from her seat and approached Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cMay Njord\u2019s blessing accompany you.\u201d</p><br/><p>She placed her lips on Tae Ho\u2019s forehead and smiled. Tae Ho looked stiffly at Ingrid and then stood up and also placed his lips on her forehead.</p><br/><p>\u201cMay Idun\u2019s blessing accompany you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had just received the blessings until now.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho blessed with good intentions and smiled brightly, but Ingrid put on a dumbfounded face and just blinked. No, it wasn\u2019t just dumbfounded but also quite surprised.</p><br/><p>\u2018It seems like she disliked your blessing.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn clicked his tongue and said sharply. The flustered Tae Ho was taken aback and hesitantly threw a question.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, did I make a mistake?\u201d</p><br/><p>Asking like this could also be a mistake.</p><br/><p>Ingrid blinked a few more times and then shook her head. She then put on a faint smile before responding.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s because it was the first time I received a blessing from a warrior. Thinking about it, it\u2019s been a long while since I was blessed by anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because it was rare for even the Valkyries to bless themselves.</p><br/><p>As Ingrid answered with a soft face, Bracky stood up abruptly from his seat.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmhm. Then I will also.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bracky approached Ingrid naturally and she showed some reflexive movements. She took a big step back and then shrank her shoulders.</p><br/><p>At the clear rejection, Bracky put on a depressed face and Ingrid then said while gulping dry saliva.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, it\u2019s nothing. I\u2019m fine. I finished preparing my heart, so come whenever you want.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hitting her chest was an attitude a warrior took in the battlefield.</p><br/><p>Bracky dropped his shoulders at the more miserable feeling and Siri laughed. She stood up to lighten the atmosphere and then blessed Ingrid in her forehead.</p><br/><p>\u201cMay Ullr\u2019s blessing accompany you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMay Njord\u2019s blessing accompany you.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a really warm exchange of blessings.</p><br/><p>Ragnar witnessed that from beginning to end and then feigned laughter and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, are you done?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bracky said that he wasn\u2019t, but his voice just echoed in the air.</p><br/><p>Siri laughed and then asked Ragnar,</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you also want a blessing teacher?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, let\u2019s eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar really wanted his meal, and Siri smiled brightly and sat next to him. Ingrid blessed the depressed Bracky and continued to eat.</p><br/><p>And after some time-</p><br/><p>After Tae Ho had tried each dish in the table-</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is it, does the food suit your tastes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s really del\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho answered reflexively but paused in the end. It was because he had heard a voice that shouldn\u2019t be heard in this place.</p><br/><p>\u201cFreya-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>The one that called out the owner of the voice was Ragnar. Everyone that was focusing on eating put on surprised faces and looked at the woman sitting next to Tae Ho, and the Goddess of Beauty answered Ragnar with graceful eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cHi Ragnar. It\u2019s been a while. It\u2019s nice to see that you are healthy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya\u2019s smile was really fascinating. Even Siri, who was a girl, and Ragnar\u2019s face got loosened for a moment. Bracky had a completely absent minded face.</p><br/><p>Freya laughed at their reactions and looked at Tae Ho. She then frowned.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t because Tae Ho showed an expression beyond being surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt makes me really competitive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya mumbled in a really low voice and then snorted and fixed her sitting posture.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s nice to see that all of you are healthy. It\u2019s enough then.\u201d</p><br/><p>She spoke a bit uncomfortably, but even that was beautiful. Could it be said that she had a haughty charm?</p><br/><p>Bracky just stared at Freya absent-mindedly, and Ragnar smiled bitterly and took a deep gulp of some alcohol.</p><br/><p>As Tae Ho, who was the only one that was fine, asked what was wrong, Freya snorted once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun was worried about you. So i just came to check on you as I was just passing by.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid something happen to Idun-nim?\u201d</p><br/><p>As he asked as he felt that something wasn\u2019t right, Freya frowned and then sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe collapsed out of exhaustion because she used too much of her strength. It\u2019s not that it was too much for her body to handle so don\u2019t worry too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho opened his eyes widely. For Idun to have collapsed. There was one one reason he could think of right now.</p><br/><p>As Tae Ho\u2019s face changed, Freya twisted her eyebrows a bit and then said with sharp eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cTreat her well when you return and don\u2019t always look for that Valkyrie. She\u2019s your one and only Goddess.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho couldn\u2019t answer anything easily at her words. It was because he felt a sudden remorse towards Idun.</p><br/><p>Freya looked at the front instead of berrating him. It was because she felt Ragnar\u2019s gaze.</p><br/><p>\u201cFreya-nim, what did you mean\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was the biggest battle in a long time. I also have things to investigate about the gate of Erin.\u201d</p><br/><p>However it turned out, the gate was connected to a place outside of Midgard. They had just gotten outside, but they still couldn\u2019t overlook it.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo we have to retrieve it and install it anew at a later time? But there are a lot of problems, just like the Great Barrier.\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya mumbled by herself and then stood from her seat.</p><br/><p>\u201cListen to the details in the conference. It seems like one great conference will be held tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for telling us.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Ragnar answered while standing up, Siri and Ingrid also followed suit. Tae Ho did the same but Freya extended her hand and made him sit down again.</p><br/><p>\u201cMay <i>my</i> blessing accompany you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya\u2019s lips touched Tae Ho\u2019s forehead, and a strong blessing that couldn\u2019t be compared to those of the Valkyries covered Tae Ho\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is it regretful that it wasn\u2019t elsewhere?\u2019</p><br/><p>Freya took her lips off from Tae Ho\u2019s forehead and asked him in his mind, and Tae Ho again grew flustered and bewildered at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, I like you a bit now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya giggled and then blessed Ragnar.</p><br/><p>And then, Bracky took a posture with a really excited face. It was just like looking at a kid before he received a present.</p><br/><p>However Freya turned around coldly and then left.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s like a storm whenever I see her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar spoke while Bracky was being pressed flat by the disappointment. Siri and Ingrid stood down as if they agreed and let out sighs.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways, if they open up a great conference\u2026..it seems like you will get to your residence a bit later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes? Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho wondered aloud at Ragnar\u2019s words. It was because he wanted to return with haste, as he was worried about Idun.</p><br/><p>Ragnar laughed as if Tae Ho\u2019s reaction was absurd and then pointed at Tae Ho with a gesture of his chin and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do think it is? You should participate in it too, commander of Idun\u2019s legion.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Gods weren\u2019t the only ones that participated in conferences. Each commander of every legion also participated in it.</p><br/><p>Not every commander participated, although at least the ones currently stationed in the base would undoubtedly show up.</p><br/><p>\u201cWarrior Tae Ho, if you are going to participate in a conference, you should contact your residence as soon as possible. The other commanders will all be accompanied by Valkyries.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ingrid said hurriedly as if it was a really important thing. Asgard viewed the benefits to be more important than the formalities, but it wasn\u2019t that they didn\u2019t take them.</p><br/><p>If Tae Ho went alone when all the other commanders got accompanied by Valkyries, it would obviously be unsightly, and it would also become a problem for the prestige of Idun\u2019s legion.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will contact them immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even if that wasn\u2019t the case, he was curious about the situation in the residence. In addition, there was no reason not to do it if he could meet Heda.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho stood up intently.</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>Tae Ho contacted the residence between lunch and dinner.</p><br/><p>As he had spent all the summoning rocks, he wrote a letter and sent it to the residence through Ingrid.</p><br/><p>And a few hours later-</p><br/><p>It was when the time to sleep was approaching.</p><br/><p>\u201cAdenmaha?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho asked with a surprised face and Adenmaha answered with a displeased face.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? I\u2019m not enough for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed like she was sharper than usual.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho looked at Adenmaha with the \u2018Eyes of the Dragon\u2019 instead of speaking, and a new letterbox that couldn\u2019t be seen before got added.</p><br/><p>[Idun\u2019s Valkyrie]</p><br/><p>[Adenmaha]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true\u2026and Heda?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s out as she had something urgent to take care of. It\u2019s become really busy nowadays so she\u2019s not always in the residence\u2026\u2026That\u2019s also one of the reasons why we hurried on turning me into a Valkyrie.\u201d</p><br/><p>One wouldn\u2019t know if Tae Ho was the only warrior like before, but there were now warriors that were staying in the residence. They needed a Valkyrie to look over the residence while Heda was out taking care of her business.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are no problems in the residence, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Rolo and McLaren recovered a lot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho let out a sigh of relief and then checked the \u2018Warrior that had a Valkyrie Meet Him\u2019 saga. It was because he thought of something.</p><br/><p>\u2018Indeed.\u2019</p><br/><p>The name of Adenmaha was added on the registered Valkyries.</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t received a blessing from her yet, but the completion was similar to Reginleif perhaps because their connection was deep.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid I get added too?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho nodded at the question of the quick-witted Adenmaha, and it was after that-</p><br/><p>Tae Ho opened his eyes widely and put a surprised face that shocked Adenmaha.</p><br/><p>It was because Adenmaha wasn\u2019t the only one that got added to the list.</p><br/><p>[Valkyrie Lord]</p><br/><p>[Freya]</p><br/><p>The chief of the Valkyries and the Goddess of Magic and Beauty.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho looked at his surroundings for a moment and activated his saga.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 31 \u2013 Idun\u2019s legion (4) &gt; End</p><hr/><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/>\n</div>"}

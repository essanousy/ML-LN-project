White traces were drawn in her blue eyes after she transformed into a golden wolf.</p><br/><p>Bracky\u2019s jaw dropped and then cheered greatly.</p><br/><p>Siri looked in front of her. She ran more fiercely to not get ran over, no, to not get left behind.</p><br/><p>The golden wolf ran with a speed that was equal to a gale. But that streak of white was still somewhat faster. Faster than sound, it passed over the golden wolf.</p><br/><p>First it was light. And then came the sound. The sound of thunder that was heard a beat later shook the world.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bracky yelled inside the lightning. He raised his own hammer at the same time the lightning shook.</p><br/><p>Siri also saw that. Her blood boiled as a warrior of Valhalla before being a God of hunt of Erin. She yelled aloud even though she was in her golden wolf transformation.</p><br/><p>The name of that man.</p><br/><p>The name of the strongest God of Thunder of Asgard!</p><br/><p>Kwagang!</p><br/><p>Lightning fell. Bracky gave strength to Siri and Siri ran faster. She rapidly chased after the lightning.</p><br/><p>Thunder.</p><br/><p>The God of Thunder.</p><br/><p>The roar of Mjolnir proved his existence.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>Freya said.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still too reckless.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her words weren\u2019t wrong. It was good to follow her words in most cases but not always.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe must have spent a considerable amount of time. We can\u2019t expect what kind of obstructions there may be in the middle.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was the same this time. Her words were established.</p><br/><p>\u201cI also know that it\u2019s a battle of time. Not knowing what kind of obstructions there are also means that we don\u2019t know the situation over there. Right, that\u2019s why you may feel more uneasy. Perhaps, they may be waiting for our help anxiously. But they are all our family.\u201d</p><br/><p>You could say that everything had ended already.</p><br/><p>They could end up wasting one of their cards in one of their reckless and impossible attempts.</p><br/><p>Freya was right like usual. Her words were based on what people called common sense.</p><br/><p>And because of that Odin didn\u2019t follow her words.</p><br/><p>Because war was like that.</p><br/><p>There were times that you had to overexert yourself to attain victory.</p><br/><p>Only an action that was out of one\u2019s common sense could escape of the expectations of the enemy.</p><br/><p>They obtained the method to open the connecting path but they still needed time to open it perfectly.</p><br/><p>Because of that they had only opened a part of the path and they sent the strongest card to the new master of Asgard, to Odin\u2019s successor.</p><br/><p>A strength needed to forcefully surpass a door that didn\u2019t open properly.</p><br/><p>Strength they had to spend to reach the master of Asgard the fastest they could.</p><br/><p>The countless obstacles that may be between them.</p><br/><p>Freya was right and Odin admitted that. But he convinced her with his next words. It wasn\u2019t about that having to overdo it because this was war.</p><br/><p>He just called out the name of the man that headed to Olympus once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is Thor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya put on a messy face. She had said before \u2018even if it\u2019s him\u2019 but she ended up admitting it in the end.</p><br/><p>Odin smiled. He stroked the cheek of Freya that was angry but was even more lovely than usual and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hurry too.\u201d</p><br/><p>For it not to end in an unreasonable thing.</p><br/><p>To not be too late.</p><br/><p>Freya\u2019s cheeks swelled up. Odin laughed and looked at a distant place.</p><br/><p>He felt like he could hear the sound of thunder beyond the crack in the connecting path that was closing.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>Poseidon felt someone coming. He had only met him a few times but he was certain of it.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why he hurried. He raised Triana up high and ordered his dependents to massacre everything.</p><br/><p>And at that same moment.</p><br/><p>Thunder flashed.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t heard from far away.</p><br/><p>The light that was faster than sound flashed and after that the loud sound that thundered through the skies and the ground fell to a low place.</p><br/><p>Kwagagagagagang`!</p><br/><p>Dozens of streaks of thunder fell down. Echidna\u2019s children, that didn\u2019t retreat even at the difference in numbers, felt fear and joy at the same time when they saw lightning incinerating the sea monsters.</p><br/><p>Drakon Ismenios, that was dodging the lumps of water to rescue Athena and Hestia, looked up at the sky for a moment. There were two Gods reflected in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a nice thunder.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thor looked at Bracky while riding on the Odin\u2019s eight legged horse, Sleipnir, and said.</p><br/><p>Bracky fired off thunder with Siri with Thor and laughed in a good mood.</p><br/><p>Siri transformed back into the appearance of a Goddess. She had returned Tae Ho the bow of Tristan and instead received the bow of Apollo.</p><br/><p>She was interested in Sleipnir the fastest horse of Asgard, that had a similar strength to Talaria of Hermes, but conversing came later.</p><br/><p>Thor didn\u2019t speak about what had happened to him. How did he open a part of the barrier, what he saw when he passed through the connecting path, and how much he suffered to arrive to this place.</p><br/><p>But that wasn\u2019t all.</p><br/><p>Thor didn\u2019t ask questions either.</p><br/><p>On how Siri and Bracky became Gods of the destroyed world Erin so suddenly.</p><br/><p>What was the current situation.</p><br/><p>What Thor had to do right now.</p><br/><p>But he knew it by instinct. That\u2019s why he told Siri and Bracky.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was enough with that. Bracky understood his meaning even though they had only exchanged gazes. Siri wanted to ask for more explanations but she endured her urge.</p><br/><p>Thor raised Mjolnir and Bracky raised his hammer.</p><br/><p>Sleipnir burbled and ran to the right. Bracky and Siri headed off to the left together.</p><br/><p>Kwagagagagang!</p><br/><p>Thunder exploded once again. The lightning of Asgard\u2019s and Erin\u2019s Gods of Thunder churned between the sea monsters and the Goddess of Hunt poured down a rain of arrows with that lightning .</p><br/><p>And Tae Ho charged towards Poseidon.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>Nidhogg was afraid of lightning.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why she curled up and covered her head with her arms. She buried her head in between her knees and closed her eyes.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg knew.</p><br/><p>That thunder wasn\u2019t a scary thing. The reason she kept shedding tears wasn\u2019t only because her injuries hurt.</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t do anything.</p><br/><p>Hydra was rolling on the ground in pain and Adenmaha, that she liked a lot, had been driven to the brink of death but there was nothing she could do. She had rolled forward a few times but it didn\u2019t work.</p><br/><p>It was like Ratatoskr had said.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg was trash. She was a fool that wasn\u2019t of any help and her existence itself was a mistake.</p><br/><p>A groan was heard between the sound of thunder as if it was scolding her. It was the groan of Adenmaha.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg flinched while covering her ears. She wanted to embrace Adenmaha that was suffering but she couldn\u2019t. She didn\u2019t have the right to do so.</p><br/><p>Tears dropped again. She didn\u2019t have the right to cry but she ended up crying out loud.</p><br/><p>And a voice was heard again.</p><br/><p>[Just what are you thinking about?]</p><br/><p>It was the voices of the Gods that could be said to be the specialty of the Gods of Olympus. Nidhogg raised her head in surprise and then realized who was the owner of the voice. It was Echidna, that was lying down next to Adenmaha.</p><br/><p>She had her lower body torn apart by force and Triana had riddled holes throughout her body. Regardless of that, she was still alive.</p><br/><p>In addition, she was receiving the power of Idun\u2019s golden apple tree and had recovered from her injuries a little bit.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg let out a sigh of relief for now. When she looked at Echidna with surprised eyes, she snickered and said.</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m also a God]</p><br/><p>Echidna was still sweating while being in pain because of her injuries but at least her voice was bright.</p><br/><p>She let out a sigh with the voices of the Gods. She did so consciously and then checked on Nidhogg.</p><br/><p>The ancient dragon of Asgard. An ancient existence that had existed since the beginning of the world compared to Echidna.</p><br/><p>But even so she was still a kid. Even if she was old in age, she was still a girl that needed someone to lead her.</p><br/><p>You were also a mother in the end.</p><br/><p>Echidna laughed when she remembered what Poseidon had told her. Her injuries hurt because of that but she couldn\u2019t do anything about it.</p><br/><p>Because it was just like he said.</p><br/><p>She decided to butt her nose in the matters like a mother of many children. She extended her hand to the kid that had lost her mother and became tired of crying.</p><br/><p>[Missy has plenty of strength only that it\u2019s asleep for now. You don\u2019t know how to use it properly.]</p><br/><p>Nidhogg blinked. The sound of thunder was noisy but she couldn\u2019t hear anything. Nidhogg only concentrated on Echidna\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>[I will help you this time. But instead, it will hurt a lot. To the point you may want to die. Will it be fine?]</p><br/><p>Nidhogg shrank down reflexively and shook her head unconsciously. She didn\u2019t like things that hurt. She hated it.</p><br/><p>But it only lasted a moment. Nidhogg\u2019s eyes rolled and looked at Adenmaha.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg closed her eyes. She gritted her teeth and then rubbed her eyes roughly to wipe away the tears.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg answered.</p><br/><p>And Echidna fulfilled her wish.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>Poseidon was flustered.</p><br/><p>He felt like he had entered a rainstorm.</p><br/><p>The sound of thunder didn\u2019t end in his surroundings. And thunder and lightning was even flashing in front of his eyes.</p><br/><p>Double flash.</p><br/><p>Twelve blades.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho\u2019s sword attacks were accompanied by lightning and storm.</p><br/><p>The sword of the round table and Excalibur attacked Poseidon without giving him time to breathe.</p><br/><p>There were two main reasons on why Poseidon was flustered.</p><br/><p>One was the Gods of thunder that were massacring his dependents.</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t there only one Thor? And how did Thor come to this place?</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t answer if this was a fortunate or unfortunate thing. It was because a knowledge that was deep inside the consciousness of Poseidon, that had become the primeval God of the sea, arose.</p><br/><p>He could feel the power of Erin from the other one compared to the pure God of thunder of Asgard. The two of them were Gods of thunder but there was a difference in their strength.</p><br/><p>It should be Thor and his son or his lesser God. A relationship of that sort.</p><br/><p>He could guess to some extent that Thor had arrived. You could say that the horse, Sleipnir, he came riding on was something like Talaria. The speed of the fastest horse was the speed which you thought of so it would be possible to come to this place if he somehow passed through the connecting path.</p><br/><p>But of course, that was possible only because it was Thor. There was a considerable distance between the connecting path and this place so he must have spent an overwhelming amount of divine power.</p><br/><p>The second reason of Poseidon\u2019s bewilderment was simple yet direct.</p><br/><p>The existence in front of him.</p><br/><p>Idun\u2019s warrior. The God of battle that came from Asgard. The successor of Odin.</p><br/><p>He could feel the strength of Erin, Asgard and even Olympus from the weapon he was holding as it seemed like Aphrodite had let Hephaestus escape.</p><br/><p>His strength beyond imagination was also understandable as he was the successor of none other than Odin.</p><br/><p>But there was something he couldn\u2019t understand. He couldn\u2019t accept.</p><br/><p>[Just why!?]</p><br/><p>Poseidon had become much stronger after transforming into his Titan appearance. On the other hand, Idun\u2019s warrior remained the same. Nothing much had changed after he released the aura of a dragon.</p><br/><p>But it became harder to face him. He felt like it was rather easier to face him when he was in his human shape.</p><br/><p>Why?</p><br/><p>Poseidon had gotten stronger. He was releasing a much stronger strength than before!</p><br/><p>Poseidon\u2019s doubt was reasonable but the answer was also clear.</p><br/><p>[Saga: Giant massacrer]</p><br/><p>The saga that had evolved one rank from \u2018Giant killer\u2019.</p><br/><p>The saga he obtained because he massacred countless giants.</p><br/><p>\u2018Give the medicine to the pharmacist and leave the treatment to the doctor.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn was joking but his words weren\u2019t wrong.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 60 \u2013 Sword of the round table (2) &gt; End</p><hr/><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/valhalla-saga-chapter-208\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 208\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/valhalla-saga-chapter-210\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 210\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"95766\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

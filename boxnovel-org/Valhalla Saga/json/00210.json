Each of the opponents he fought in the tower of shadows were all Milesians that were disciples of Scathach.</p><br/><p>But Tae Ho was a warrior of Valhalla. He was a specialist in killing giants and there were few cases of strong opponents he defeated until now not being giants.</p><br/><p>How did he fight against giants? How did he dodge their attacks and block them?</p><br/><p>He knew them all too well. Fighting against giants was like breathing to him.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Poseidon wasn\u2019t accustomed to fighting in his titan form. He didn\u2019t realize there were few opponents that were smaller than him. When he raised great merits in Titanomachy, all his opponents were similar sized giants or monsters.</p><br/><p>Poseidon faltered against Tae Ho\u2019s merciless attacks. He was trying to release his divine power and stab the air with Triana.</p><br/><p>Poseidon felt anxious. He heard the sound of thunder increasing.</p><br/><p>What would happen if that sound of thunder stopped? Would he be able to endure if Thor and his child butted in the fight after massacring all of Poseidon\u2019s sea dependents?</p><br/><p>He had to hurry. He needed to change the situation of this battle into a favorable one. Poseidon was still a level above Tae Ho if just considering divine power.</p><br/><p>Poseidon roared loudly. He unleashed his blue divine power and pushed away Tae Ho for a moment. After that he looked at a distant place. It was towards the isolated sea that was beyond the walls.</p><br/><p>That sea wasn\u2019t merely a means of transportation. It was a mobile sacred force that provided him with the power to release his full strength even in Mesena, an area deep inland.</p><br/><p>But this sea was also an overwhelming amount of water.</p><br/><p>Poseidon ordered the sea as its ruler. He retrieved the power of the primeval God of sea Pontus, who was maintaining the ocean fragment, and made it move.</p><br/><p>The water shook and then began moving in a certain direction.</p><br/><p>Poseidon\u2019s plan was simple. He would strike Mesena with the sea. After that attack, the sea water would scatter and he wouldn\u2019t be able to use it as a sacred force, but it didn\u2019t matter. If the overwhelming amount of sea water swept away Mesena, everyone who was in it would lose their lives.</p><br/><p>[Come! Sea! Rise up! Hail!]</p><br/><p>Poseidon raised Triana and ordered. His yell made even the sound of thunder subside for a moment.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho didn\u2019t turn around but he felt it. The massive wave would soon cover the walls. The walls the humans raised to block enemy soldiers, not a wave. In the first place, the height of the body of water was higher than the walls so there was no way the walls could endure it.</p><br/><p>But the city had to endure. Instead of charging at Poseidon, Tae Ho stabbed the sword of the round table and Excalibur in the ground and unleashed his dark blue divinity.</p><br/><p>His divine power, amplified by the Hall of Valhalla, reinforced the walls of Mesena. He confronted the torrent ceawith a wall of dark blue divinity.</p><br/><p>The heil covered Mesena and part of the hail that passed over the walls entered inside of the city.</p><br/><p>But the walls didn\u2019t fall. It broke the hail as if it was a breakwater.</p><br/><p>Poseidon was really surprised but his surprise didn\u2019t last for long. There was still a lot of water remaining. Even if Idun\u2019s warrior was inside his sacred force, he had no way to endure this attack.</p><br/><p>Poseidon\u2019s thoughts were right but there was only one thing wrong with it.</p><br/><p>There were people landing next to Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>They raised their hammers almost at the same time and called out lightning.</p><br/><p>The power of Thor and Bracky got added to the walls of Mesena. Siri also inserted her power of a golden wolf into the walls.</p><br/><p>Endure it.</p><br/><p>The Gods of Asgard ordered. The Gods of Erin also did and the walls of Olympus cheered.</p><br/><p>The dark blue divinity became stronger than the walls. It surged up high to stop the hail and it endured the impact load that transcended one\u2019s imagination.</p><br/><p>The sea scattered. It got split in two while having Mesena in the middle and spread widely.</p><br/><p>Poseidon let out a roar of grief. He called all his dependents, that got to take some air thanks to the struggle of strength of the Gods, and made them charge. At the same time, he gathered power from the near sea water to prepare for a strong attack.</p><br/><p>The number of monsters that gathered at Poseidon\u2019s order amounted to a hundred. You could say that all of them were a running hail.</p><br/><p>But Drakon Ismenios smiled on top of the walls of Mesena. He raised his arms and cheered.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy son!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFather!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBaby!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF, father!\u201d</p><br/><p>Thor and Bracky called out to each other. Siri replied in a flustered state at Thor\u2019s kind call.</p><br/><p>And thunder flashed once again. The lightning storm occurring in the sky crushed away the monsters. The rain of arrows accompanied the lightning bolts like usual.</p><br/><p>Poseidon didn\u2019t care about them. He could know it as he had reigned as a strong God for a long time. They were almost at their limit. Their limit would come faster than him.</p><br/><p>Thor had spent a lot of strength on coming to this place and spent even more strength to protect the walls of Mesena.</p><br/><p>It was the same for the Gods of Erin.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why this would be the last. The last struggle.</p><br/><p>The moment the lightning bolts subsided, the attack Poseidon prepared would devour them.</p><br/><p>Poseidon held Triana tightly and then pillars that were dozens of meters high surged up behind him. They gathered into one and made a huge current.</p><br/><p>The monsters had collapsed and the sound of thunder had also weakened.</p><br/><p>This was the moment. Poseidon swung Triana and made the pillars of water charge!</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>Loud explosions were heard but that wasn\u2019t made by the water pillars. It was the sound that was made when the water pillars got destroyed by an overwhelming shock.</p><br/><p>Poseidon also lost balance and crumpled down. He could see someone standing up in a distant place.</p><br/><p>It was a black haired Goddess.</p><br/><p>She had the appearance of a human but she had a strong aura of a dragon like Idun\u2019s warrior.</p><br/><p>Her face had become a mess for having cried too much but she wasn\u2019t crying now. It was painful to even breathe but she still extended her arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m-rolling!\u201d</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t actually roll. It was a conscious yell to burst out her divine power.</p><br/><p>At that moment, an overwhelming power got released from Nidhogg. A power that was stronger than when she destroyed the water pillars covered Poseidon.</p><br/><p>Poseidon screamed while being pressed down by that power.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg also screamed and released more strength.</p><br/><p>It was a clash between to divine powers.</p><br/><p>And this fight was already decided from the beginning.</p><br/><p>It was impossible for Nidhogg to beat Poseidon when he had the power of Pontus with him while she was an existence of a foreign world and didn\u2019t even have her real body.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg also knew that. It wasn\u2019t that she understood it rationally but she realized it by instinct.</p><br/><p>But regardless of that she still did her best. She endured the pain that seemed like it was grinding her entire body and tried to hold down Poseidon at least one more second.</p><br/><p>She yelled out loud.</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho master!\u201d</p><br/><p>He answered at that earnest call. Replied to the prayer of the one that believed in him.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho surged up to the sky. He spread his dragon wings made of light and flew up to the sky that had turned black due to the lightning and the hail.</p><br/><p>Bracky, that had spent all his strength and couldn\u2019t even move, knew. It was the same for Siri that was covered in sweat.</p><br/><p>Thor raised up Mjolnir. He squeezed out the last drop of strength he had and prepared for one final lightning.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg finally collapsed but there was a satisfying smile in her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho master\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg tried hard. She endured it even though it hurt. I will leave the next thing to you.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg bit her lips. She caught her consciousness that was fading away and looked at the sky.</p><br/><p>Poseidon let out a painful groan. He gathered the sea water and divine power once again and raised his head.</p><br/><p>High in the sky.</p><br/><p>The place everyone was looking at.</p><br/><p>The God of battle and a white dragon were becoming one.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>When Nidhogg stood up Echidna butt in once again.</p><br/><p>She could only do that.</p><br/><p>Because there was someone looking at her when they didn\u2019t even have the strength to lift a finger and had suffered severe injuries that it was a miracle they were still alive. There was someone grabbing her hand pleading.</p><br/><p>Echidna laughed once again. She felt like she would also die for having awakened a part of Nidhogg\u2019s strength by force but she decided to hang there.</p><br/><p>\u201cA woman in love is stronger than anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>She mumbled and grabbed Adenmaha\u2019s hands. She faced her blue craving eyes and whispered.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said that you will even follow him to hell right?\u201d</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t need an answer. Her actions right now were already an answer.</p><br/><p>Echidna looked at herself. They looked different, had different temperaments and even their situation was different but she still did that. That\u2019s why she transmitted her the last strength she had. She wished Adenmaha could do the thing she hadn\u2019t been able to do in the past.</p><br/><p>\u201cFollow him then. And don\u2019t let him go like I did.\u201d</p><br/><p>Typhon.</p><br/><p>The one that wished to destroy the world but Echidna\u2019s man, that she couldn\u2019t not love him.</p><br/><p>Echidna awoke Adenmaha\u2019s power by force. She passed her limit by force that she had kept to not hurt herself.</p><br/><p>She would probably get really hurt and would experience great pain after the battle.</p><br/><p>But it was good anyways. The important thing was this moment.</p><br/><p>Echidna handed over all her strength to Adenmaha. Thanks to that Echidna couldn\u2019t even mumble through the voices of the Gods but she was satisfied with it. She looked at the sky with dumbfounded eyes and thought.</p><br/><p>Get him lewd lady.</p><br/><p>The spoiled master needs you lady.</p><br/><p>Echidna closed her eyes and a white dragon surged up above her head.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>Adenmaha caught up with Tae Ho and he got on her back.</p><br/><p>[Saga: The one that conquers dragons]</p><br/><p>[Saga: Dragon monarch]</p><br/><p>[Saga: The one that rode on a Goddess]</p><br/><p>[Saga: The charge of the warriors is like a storm]</p><br/><p>[Saga: Incarnation of the World dragon]</p><br/><p>Several sagas got activated at the same time. Adenmaha transformed into an incarnation of the Dragon world surpassing the frost dragon Javier. She shared all her divine power and strength with Tae Ho and not only her senses.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho said.</p><br/><p>And Adenmaha agreed. She changed her direction while surging up.</p><br/><p>From the sky to the ground.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho gathered the swords he was holding in his hands in one. The two swords transformed into light and then became only one sword.</p><br/><p>The twelve sentences appeared.</p><br/><p>And covered the one sentence.</p><br/><p>The sentence of the king and the sentences of the knights that protected him.</p><br/><p>They became one.</p><br/><p>They released eye blinding light with the real Sword of the round table.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s go.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn ordered.</p><br/><p>And Bracky said. Siri spoke and lastly, Thor\u2019s thunder was heard.</p><br/><p>Athena, that was looking at the sky while holding Hestia in the walls of Mesena, sent her divinity high to the sky and yelled. Drakon Ismenios cried and Rolo, that was protecting Nidhogg that had collapsed, roared.</p><br/><p>Go.</p><br/><p>Go.</p><br/><p>Go!</p><br/><p>Warrior of Valhalla!</p><br/><p>The Sword of the round table got dyed in his dark blue divinity.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha flew. She descended vertically.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho raised the Sword of the round table like a spear and roared.</p><br/><p>What he was firing was the \u2018Dragon cannon\u2019.</p><br/><p>Draconic Ballista!</p><br/><p>Kwagagagagaga!</p><br/><p>Thunder flashed and dozens of lightning bolts fell in front of Adenmaha. Everytime one of them flashed, the rune that was with the lightning bolt seized the moment and made a path of lightning with dozens of them.</p><br/><p>Poseidon couldn\u2019t get out after getting surrounded by lightning. He couldn\u2019t even think of piercing through the path of lightning. The only thing he could do was to block the attack with all his strength.</p><br/><p>Poseidon roared and extended Triana. The strength of Poseidon that was released in his desperate efforts poured to the front.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho didn\u2019t dodge it. He charged over the path of lightning with Adenmaha.</p><br/><p>They clashed and it got dispersed. The white meteor crushed Poseidon\u2019s divine power into pieces and the dark blue divinity charged.</p><br/><p>The Sword of the round table pierced Poseidon\u2019s chest. Poseidon couldn\u2019t endure the overwhelming shock that was accompanied by the God killer power. He crashed in the ground and that was the end of it. The blue divine power got entangled with the dark blue divine power and exploded.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha flew with strength. She flew low in the ground about to crash but she got out of the restraints of gravity and surged up again.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg saw that. She cried because it still hurt but she could still smile brightly.</p><br/><p>The children of Echidna cheered. The golden apple tree of Idun grew up bigger as if it had a consciousness of its own and blessed Mesena entirely.</p><br/><p>[Your prestige has spread to all of Olympus]</p><br/><p>[You have obtained the title \u2018the one that killed a God\u2019]</p><br/><p>[You obtained the title \u2018conqueror of the sea\u2019]</p><br/><p>[Mesena obeys you]</p><br/><p>[The dependents of the sea fear you]</p><br/><p>[The dependents of the sea that got liberated are praising you]</p><br/><p>The voices of the Gods was heard in consecution and at the same time sentences of light popped up.</p><br/><p>[Synchro rate: 92%]</p><br/><p>[Master of Asgard]</p><br/><p>[Incarnation of the World dragon]</p><br/><p>[King of Erin]</p><br/><p>Tae Ho breathed roughly.</p><br/><p>He sensed it as the master of Asgard.</p><br/><p>The connecting path was opening up again and finally, the warriors of Valhalla proceeded to attack Olympus</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>[Master]</p><br/><p>Adenmaha called Tae Ho and he stroke her neck and looked at a distant place.</p><br/><p>The place he was looking at was the east.</p><br/><p>The highest and biggest mountain located at the center of the world.</p><br/><p>\u201cOlympus.\u201d</p><br/><p>The king of Zeus that was located at that place.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho held his breath.

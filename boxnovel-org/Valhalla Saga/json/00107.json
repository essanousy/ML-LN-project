The face of someone who just spotted a beautiful person.</p><br/><p>But it was a bit different. Should she relate it to an expression one held when viewing something beautiful in nature? It was obvious that Tae Ho hadn\u2019t fallen head over heels for Freya.</p><br/><p>Freya suppressed her bewilderment and focused on making her gaze even more coquettish. Again, Tae Ho faced her eyes, but he still didn\u2019t fall over her beauty like a slobbering idiot.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ah. Isn\u2019t he impotent?\u2019</p><br/><p>Or he likes men.</p><br/><p>However, Freya discarded that thought as her beauty didn\u2019t only affect men but also women.</p><br/><p>She was certain that the reason Idun\u2019s warrior could be so calm in her presence was because he was thinking of another woman.</p><br/><p>Freya laughed inwardly and then put on her usual, bright expression instead of a seductive one and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cCommander of Idun. I\u2019m called Freya.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun\u2019s warrior greets the Goddess of Magic and Beauty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho had been educated about the Gods of Asgard by the Valkyries, Bracky, Siri, and others. As he called out the fields of Freya\u2019s divinity, she put on a satisfied smile.</p><br/><p>But it was then-</p><br/><p>\u201cFreya!\u201d</p><br/><p>A shrill voice pierced through the air. A corner of the cozy room cracked to reveal plains behind it. The next second, the whole wall broke down to unveil a very familiar apple tree.</p><br/><p>Two opposing domains became mixed in one spot; however, the plains couldn\u2019t completely overtake the bedroom. Freya, who\u2019d sat up on her bed, let out a sigh before speaking to the Goddess standing there.</p><br/><p>\u201cHi. It\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>A really indignant voice.</p><br/><p>Although her face was obscured by the light shrouding her, one could clearly feel the anger radiating off her.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho was a bit frightened at her unfamiliar visage, but Freya merely waved her hands as if she\u2019d expected it.</p><br/><p>\u201cCalm down, calm down. As the chief of the Valkyries, I just came here to compliment the warrior that had performed many great merits. I wasn\u2019t planning on taking him or anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her words were as if addressing a kindly junior of hers.</p><br/><p>Idun didn\u2019t respond and only glared at Freya. The latter just shrugged.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t even look like he\u2019s interested in swapping legions. It really hurts my pride, you know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, if Freya grew determined and went all out, the story may have changed, but as she had said, it wasn\u2019t her intention.</p><br/><p>It appeared that Idun had grown even more agitated at Freya\u2019s words, as she walked to stand firmly between Tae Ho and the bewitching goddess. Her aura was like a cat\u2019s whose hair had bristled.</p><br/><p>Freya continued to smile as she slowly crawled toward the end of her bed to look at Idun and Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun\u2019s warrior, as your Goddess is so brusque, I\u2019ll get straight to the point.\u201d</p><br/><p>Idun still didn\u2019t say anything. As Tae Ho nodded behind her, Freya crossed her legs to show her sensual curves before continuing.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should already know, but I\u2019m the chief of the Valkyries. I aid Odin, the King of Gods, in ruling over Valhalla.\u201d</p><br/><p>The one at the apex of Valhalla\u2019s command was obviously Odin, but his next direct subordinate wasn\u2019t Thor, but Freya.</p><br/><p>Among other things, the rune growth system which was every warrior of Valhalla\u2019s roots was created by her.</p><br/><p>Although she\u2019d collaborated heavily with Odin, no one could dispute the notion that she was the true creator of Valhalla.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun\u2019s commander, the achievements you\u2019ve earned this time aren\u2019t small. You must have already received praise from the Valkyries, but I came to this place because I wanted to compliment you directly. A great warrior deserves treatment suitable to their accomplishments.\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya\u2019s beauty changed based on the situation, just like a fairy pitt.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Freya\u2019s beauty emanated a stark nobility and air of high standing.</p><br/><p>After Frigg, Odin\u2019s wife and Asgard\u2019s landlady, died, Freya assumed her role as adminstrator of Asgard.</p><br/><p>As a result, she was accustomed to the role of a queen and gave off a profound dignity alongside her usual brightness.</p><br/><p>Freya stopped talking for a moment and flicked her eyes between Idun and Tae Ho. At that, anger appeared in Idun\u2019s eyes for a moment, but she expertly regained her composure.</p><br/><p>Freya laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun\u2019s commander, while I was thinking of what reward to bestow you with, I heard something fun. After hearing, I knew exactly what to prepare. Apparently, you\u2019re called the \u2018Valkyrie Master\u2019 by the warriors of Valhalla?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho was at a complete loss for words and couldn\u2019t speak.</p><br/><p>It may have been his imagination, but he felt a bit of resentment from Idun\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>Whatever the case, Freya laughed gracefully as if finding Tae Ho\u2019s reaction amusing and then crossed her legs the other way.</p><br/><p>\u201cExtend your hands. I will bestow upon you something suitable for a Valkyrie master.\u201d</p><br/><p>At Freya\u2019s words, Tae Ho extended his two hands and light seemed to condense in the air. A white, flawless horn appeared within them.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a Valkyrie Horn, something like the sibling of Gjallarhorn which Heimdal possesses. When you blow it once, the Valkyries nearby will gather at your side. This horn holds my decree as Valkyrie chief, so all those who gather will follow your orders without question.\u201d</p><br/><p>Originally, a superior-ranked warrior held higher authority than a Valkyrie, but that didn\u2019t mean they could order them around.</p><br/><p>Of course, if a superior rank became a commander of a legion, they could obviously give orders to the legion\u2019s Valkyries, but it wasn\u2019t that they could do the same to the Valkyries in other legions.</p><br/><p>There were many cases of Valkyries following and respecting the orders of a legion\u2019s commander, but strictly speaking, there weren\u2019t obligated to follow the orders of a commander from another legion.</p><br/><p>What Freya gave was an object that granted him the right to gather and order any Valkyries on a whim.</p><br/><p>It was a reward that only the real Valkyrie master could grant.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho suppressed his happiness and thanked her politely.</p><br/><p>As Freya nodded lightly, Idun, who\u2019d been staring, spoke up casually.</p><br/><p>\u201cFreya, you\u2019re finished with your business, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Her voice was still on guard even if it was less than before.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t rush me too much. After all, you\u2019re in front of none other than your warrior.\u201d</p><br/><p>Idun\u2019s mouth clamped shut at her words. Such was the integrity of honor between Gods. Regardless of how she\u2019d meant her words, they were still true.</p><br/><p>Actually, Tae Ho was really surprised about Idun\u2019s behavior. Her actions, expressions, and words were quite different from her usual self.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really are being favored.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m always thankful.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Tae Ho gave a suitable answer immediately, Freya laughed and nodded. She turned towards Idun once more.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome closer. I will give you a blessing before the divine message ends.\u201d</p><br/><p>She was speaking to Tae Ho, but her eyes were directed at Idun. Tae Ho also turned to look at Idun.</p><br/><p>Idun pressed her lips inside the light at the eyes of the two people and then stood to the side and opened a path.</p><br/><p>Freya smiled cutely at her silent permission before switching her gaze to Tae Ho. He gulped dryly and then stood in front of Freya and lowered his posture.</p><br/><p>\u201cRaise your head.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho raised his head as Freya approached him. She arched her back to bless him on the forehead.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Freya turned to look at Idun with a malicious smile. She then blessed Tae Ho\u2019s lips instead of his forehead.</p><br/><p>\u201cMay my blessing accompany you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The time their lips touched was merely an instant; however, it was a really vivid and memorable one.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho opened his eyes widely in surprise, and Idun exploded in anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cFreya-unnie!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s meet another time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya laughed and then waved her hand. Both Freya and the bedroom disappeared like a lie and the plains swept over the entire surrounding area.</p><br/><p>It was a perfect hit and run.</p><br/><p>After a few seconds had passed-</p><br/><p>Tae Ho wasn\u2019t happy even though he\u2019d just been kissed by the Goddess of Beauty. No, he rather felt that he was faced with misfortune.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh..um\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Tae Ho struggled awkwardly, Idun took a deep breath and then spoke as if nothing had happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmhm, my warrior Tae Ho. It\u2019s good to see that you are healthy.\u201d</p><br/><p>She acted as usual but also felt incredibly uneasy.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, me too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho just made it worse. All of a sudden, Idun swooped down in front of Tae Ho and spoke urgently.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you like that? Did she use a strange magic on you? Is that it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya was the Goddess of Magic. Whatever Idun\u2019s thoughts were, several warriors of various legions had indeed migrated to Freya\u2019s while vying desperately for her love.</p><br/><p>The light obscuring Idun\u2019s face revealed traces of shock, worry, rage, and fear all at once.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho peered at the light and then opened his mouth gradually.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, um\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was just wondering why you\u2019re always hiding behind the light.\u201d</p><br/><p>It went without saying that their awkwardness was a result of the recent situation, but Tae Ho also hadn\u2019t made his question up.</p><br/><p>When he first faced Idun, he thought that all the Gods were like this.</p><br/><p>But Thor was different. He could clearly see his face.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that weird until now since Tae Ho only had two references.</p><br/><p>But after seeing Freya, he became certain that there was something strange. While Freya seemed to glow from her charm, there wasn\u2019t any bright light on her like Idun.</p><br/><p>Like Thor, she\u2019d been clearly visible.</p><br/><p>Idun flinched at Tae Ho\u2019s words and then answered with a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf\u2026.If you want to see what\u2019s beyond the light, I can show it to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Idun didn\u2019t particularly wait for Tae Ho\u2019s answer. As she finished speaking, she raised her right hand and touched her face. The light covering her face subsequently disappeared.</p><br/><p>Beautiful, blond hair that seemed woven from countless strands of gold was revealed atop her translucent face.</p><br/><p>However, he could only see half of her face. Across the rest, Idun wore a encompassing, black mask that contrasted her fair features.</p><br/><p>Of course, it wasn\u2019t that the mask covered her entire face, so he could still see her expression clearly. Her sharp chin and pretty lips were also clear.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, it seems like you are somewhat disappointed.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Idun spoke with a sulky voice, Tae Ho flinched and shook his head hurriedly. To be frank, he\u2019d merely been baffled to see a mask appear under the light. Regardless of what he saw, Idun had still listened to his request. It wasn\u2019t something he should be disappointed about.</p><br/><p>Idun covered her mouth with her hand and laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m joking. Joking.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although she was wearing a mask, it was much easier to read her emotions and expressions than when she was hidden behind the light.</p><br/><p>\u2018But what did she hide herself for in the first place?\u2019</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t imagine any reason for it.</p><br/><p>In addition, by looking at Idun\u2019s movements, it didn\u2019t seem like a normal mask. It was like a veil or a pair of sunglasses that the wearer could use to look from the inside.</p><br/><p>While Tae Ho was pondering it, Idun looked up at the sky and pouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy warrior, Tae Ho, it\u2019s unfortunate, but I will have to return today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, she hadn\u2019t originally planned to send a divine message at all.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho nodded and then lowered his posture like he did with Freya. Idun thought for a moment after seeing Tae Ho kneel, but she ended up blessing him on his forehead like always.</p><br/><p>\u201cMay my blessing accompany you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Idun revealed a gentle smile and Tae Ho answered in kind. He then blinked and woke from his dream.</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>The number of warriors that\u2019d remained behind in Valhalla to eradicate the remaining fomoires were exactly a hundred. This included Tae Ho\u2019s group.</p><br/><p>The number decided upon after guessing that it wasn\u2019t a good influence for existences of Asgard to roam Midgard for longer than necessary.</p><br/><p>Ingrid stayed back in Kalliv Castle with a few warriors.</p><br/><p>It was to dissuade some neighboring countries from invading the now leaderless Kalliv Ahim.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that acceptable for the existences of Asgard to provoke to politics in Midgard, but it was only to prevent Kalliv Ahim from suffering any further damage.</p><br/><p>It was a really irresponsible thing to step back saying that human affairs should be handled among themselves.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho split up some forces with Rasgrid as she had the most leadership experience out of the Valkyries who\u2019d remained behind.</p><br/><p>It was also to exterminate the few fomoires that were left effectively.</p><br/><p>And a month later-</p><br/><p>As the mopping up of the fomoires was ending, a change occurred.</p><br/><p>The smoke coming from the fragments of Garmr\u2019s soul that Ingrid had stored away started to blow in a specific direction.</p><br/><p>Valhalla showed an immediate reaction, as this phenomenon had already happened in the first expedition in Midgard.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho and Rasgrid received a heavenly order and paused the cleanup of the remaining fomoires to make haste towards another location.</p><br/><p>They rushed to where Ingrid and the soul fragments were at.</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>The Giant of Earth, Balgad, didn\u2019t personally witness the battle that occurred in Kalliv Castle, but he knew what happened.</p><br/><p>The Giant of the Night, Avalt, thought of the Giant of Strength, Harad, at the last moments of Bress the Tyrant\u2019s life.</p><br/><p>Idun\u2019s warrior.</p><br/><p>The one that had slain the Giant of Strength was Thor; however, Avalt remembered what Harad was trying to do before he died. He tried to kill the high-named Ragnar Lodbrok and the warrior of Idun that wasn\u2019t even at the intermediate rank.</p><br/><p>It was then that he\u2019d thought that Idun\u2019s warrior may very well become a great enemy for the Magician King one day.</p><br/><p>The day of Bress\u2019 death, Avalt was able to confirm his belief.</p><br/><p>Idun\u2019s warrior was dangerous. There was a dire need to sever the roots before the flower bloomed entirely.</p><br/><p>The Giant of the Night, Avalt, opened his eyes in the darkness. At that moment, there was a voice that called out to him like an illusion.</p><br/><p>The Giant of Earth, Balgad.</p><br/><p>It was him.</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>The Magician King, Utgard Loki, sat upon his throne and looked off to a distant place. He rolled his fingers across his armrest and sent out two streams of his magic carrying orders.</p><br/><p>One was sent to the front lines and the other to Midgard.</p><br/><p>The magician king took a deep breath. He felt like the old wound in his shoulder by the Prince of Light, Cuchulainn, was itching.</p><br/><p>A hundred years since the Great War.</p><br/><p>Soon,, the time to stand on the battlefield would come again.</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>The Gods on par with Thor couldn\u2019t enter through the Great Barrier. The possibility of their immense power influencing the barrier was too high.</p><br/><p>Loki was certainly a strong existence; however, he was the God of Lies and could portray his level of strength however he wished.</p><br/><p>Loki was now inside the Great Barrier. He, who stood in a place cast in shadow, was glaring at the sky like a statue. Far above, a flock of crows were traveling through the air.</p><br/><p>Odin.</p><br/><p>Loki took his eyes off the flock. He analyzed the message of the Magician King that had grown faint after having passed through several territories.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet everything happen as the King wishes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loki mumbled in a low voice before moving with vigor.</p><br/><p>The biggest country of humans in Midgard, Ironside, was now his target.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 29 \u2013 Idun\u2019s commander (3) &gt; End</p><br/>\n</div>"}

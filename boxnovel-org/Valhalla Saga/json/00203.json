That was the same for Prometheus and it wasn\u2019t that different for Adenmaha.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFreya is prettier.\u201d</p><br/><p>He said that once again and a roar was heard from a distance. An overwhelming rage swelled up like an explosion along the pink divinity.</p><br/><p>It was Aphrodite\u2019s rage.</p><br/><p>She was sure to have heard Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u2018Crazy bastard.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn spoke briefly with a flood of emotions. He thought he was the God of cheating but it seemed like he was a God of provocations.</p><br/><p>But Tae Ho\u2019s provocations hadn\u2019t ended yet. He swelled up his dark blue divinity to stop the pink divinity that was flowing towards them and then raised up Adenmaha that was in the floor.</p><br/><p>\u201cCertainly. Adenmaha is prettier than Freya-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha let out a strange sound again. Hermes and Prometheus looked at Adenmaha and Tae Ho while blinking and Tae Ho nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cAdenmaha is prettier than Freya-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha\u2019s face got dyed in red. No, her neck also turned completely red.</p><br/><p>Originally she should have laughed like a fool like usual but it was different this time. Adenmaha bit her lips and didn\u2019t know what to do.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hey you crazy bastard! How can you make your ally fall in confusion!\u2019</p><br/><p>But Tae Ho didn\u2019t mind that either. He spoke with a sincere voice that anyone could discern it wasn\u2019t a lie.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was right. Men were blind in their own causes. The power of love was still great.</p><br/><p>Freya was above Aphrodite and Adenmaha was above her once again. Honestly speaking, Aphrodite was quite beautiful but it was impossible to compare her to Idun or Heda.</p><br/><p>\u2018This bastard is for real.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was when Cuchulainn was speaking in an absurd tone. Aphrodite\u2019s aura, that had stayed silent for a while as if to listen to Tae Ho\u2019s words, erupted once again. The roar that could be said to be rage itself was heard from a far place and shook the entire palace.</p><br/><p>Even if that wasn\u2019t the case, Aphrodite had strong pride in her looks. And that pride had become stronger as she turned into a being that wanted to destroy the world.</p><br/><p>But Tae Ho had crushed her pride. He didn\u2019t even fend against her seduction but also counter used it and then said that she was inferior to the Goddess of beauty of Asgard and after that he even said that she was inferior to some Valkyrie that appeared from somewhere.</p><br/><p>Aphrodite couldn\u2019t endure that. Her head turned white out of rage and she couldn\u2019t think of anything.</p><br/><p>It was a perfect provocation.</p><br/><p>\u2018But that\u2019s true.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho mumbled inwardly and acted quickly. They didn\u2019t have the time to keep talking like this. They had to get out of the palace of Aphrodite the fastest they could.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho first looked at Hephaestus with his \u2018eyes of the dragon\u2019. It was impossible for him to walk alone as all of his tendons had been cut off.</p><br/><p>\u201cHermes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hermes flinched at Tae Ho\u2019s sharp yell but then shook his head. It was impossible to use a magic circle inside the palace of Aphrodite just like he had told him before they departed.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho swung his sword and crushed the aura of Aphrodite and at the same time swung his hand and floated several runes he had prepared beforehand.</p><br/><p>They had infiltrated silently but that wouldn\u2019t be the same when they got out. They had been exposed anyways so they only thought of the shortest path.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho overlapped nine runes and looked at a distance with his \u2018eyes of the dragon\u2019. He activated the rune magic at a point in the ceiling.</p><br/><p>A strong pillar of light that was like a dragon breath extended from Tae Ho\u2019s hands. It destroyed everything in its path and opened up a new path.</p><br/><p>\u201cRun!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho yelled and embraced Adenmaha. Prometheus carried Hephaestus and Hermes grabbed that Prometheus while cursing.</p><br/><p>\u201cTalaria!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hermes yelled. He surged up to the sky with his winged shoes and Tae Ho got ahead of that Hermes. He kicked the air in consecution and got out of the palace in an instant.</p><br/><p>[I won\u2019t let you go!]</p><br/><p>Aphrodite yelled with the voice of the Gods. She told them her objective through her divine power filled with rage.</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t a fool and knew of a good method to break this situation.</p><br/><p>And that wasn\u2019t different for Tae Ho. He knew what Aphrodite was thinking about and that\u2019s why he acted without even breathing.</p><br/><p>[Saga: Master of frost]</p><br/><p>Adenmaha transformed into a white frost dragon and at the same time Tae Ho clenched the summoning rocks and called the names of Nidhogg, Rolo and Ismenios quickly. It wasn\u2019t to call them, that were causing a mess outside the palace.</p><br/><p>Counter summon.</p><br/><p>He summoned them back to the city of Echidna, that had become Tae Ho\u2019s base like the residence of Idun.</p><br/><p>Hermes and Prometheus got on Adenmaha\u2019s back. Hephaestus opened his mouth with difficulty. It seemed like he wanted to say something.</p><br/><p>But they didn\u2019t have time to listen to him. Tae Ho swung his sword filled with his dark blue divinity towards the three people.</p><br/><p>Hermes and Prometheus fainted at the same time. Hephaestus opened his eyes widely at the sudden attack but it was impossible to resist. He could only faint like the other two people.</p><br/><p>This took place in only a few seconds.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho took a breath again. He fixed the three people that fainted in Adenmaha\u2019s back with rune magic and then raised his head.</p><br/><p>The pink divinity stretched like a tentacle and was about to attack Adenmaha. Not only that, but the winged humans that were fighting against Nidhogg also headed towards Tae Ho. There were kids and teens mixed in them and it seemed like he was looking at a beautiful group of angels.</p><br/><p>[Saga: The one that conquers dragons]</p><br/><p>Adenmaha flinched and then spread her wings. Tae Ho grabbed Gallatin and Arondight and danced in his swordsmanship at Adenmaha\u2019s back. His dark blue divinity became a sword aura and cut down the pink tentacles.</p><br/><p>\u201cFly up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmahaa replied. The white frost dragon started to ascend and Aphrodite released her power. She used the worst card Tae Ho was expecting.</p><br/><p>A seduction not directed to Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho could endure her seduction but that wasn\u2019t the case for the others. Actually, Hermes had been half enchanted just by having Aphrodite release her aura.</p><br/><p>That was the reason Tae Ho sent back Nidhogg and the others and also knocked out Hermes and Prometheus.</p><br/><p>Aphrodite hadn\u2019t made a surprise attack when they invaded but the situation was different now. She concentrated her power on the only one that remained in Tae Ho\u2019s group.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha.</p><br/><p>The one that had to stay because she had to carry Hermes, etc. And the only one he couldn\u2019t knock out.</p><br/><p>A pink divinity that was close to being red covered Adenmaha. Aphrodite\u2019s seduction didn\u2019t differentiate between sexes and races.</p><br/><p>Listen to me.</p><br/><p>Love me.</p><br/><p>Obey me.</p><br/><p>Aphrodite\u2019s enchanted voice reached Adenmaha. She ordered her to fold her wings and land down.</p><br/><p>But Adenmaha didn\u2019t do that. She still continued to fly regardless of Aphrodite\u2019s enchant.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t because her seduction didn\u2019t work or she had a power to endure her seduction like Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cAdenmaha is pretty, nice, cute.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho was also saying words to Adenmaha diligently. He enchanted her faster than Aphrodite.</p><br/><p>[Bragi\u2019s rune]</p><br/><p>[Saga: The one that conquers dragons]</p><br/><p>[Saga: The one that rode on a Goddess]</p><br/><p>[Tae Ho\u2019s Valkyrie]</p><br/><p>He had used everything he could. He didn\u2019t have to be picky on his methods to win against Aphrodite\u2019s seduction.</p><br/><p>And he accomplished something. Adenmaha didn\u2019t get seduced by Aphrodite. She was still flying with all her strength.</p><br/><p>\u2018She\u2019s going to die!\u2019</p><br/><p>But Cuchulainn yelled loudly. It was because Adenmaha\u2019s state wasn\u2019t good.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuaang.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed like Adenmaha\u2019s body was turning red even though she was a white dragon.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha let out a weird moan and tried hard to endure it. Endure herself from fainting away because of the embarrassment, etc. and not because of the seduction from both parties.</p><br/><p>\u201cAdenmaha is great. Wonderful. Really lovely.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHkugh.\u201d</p><br/><p>She stumbled at that moment but gritted her teeth and endured it. A war of wanting to stop listening and wanting to keep listening happened inside her head.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho whispered towards her. He transmitted his feelings and words that got amplified by Bragi\u2019s words directly towards her through the \u2018one that conquers dragons\u2019.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha staggered and barely flew up while panting. But whatever the case the flight was still a flight and they were getting farther from Aphrodite\u2019s palace.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho didn\u2019t stop whispering to her and looked back at the palace.</p><br/><p>The number of angels chasing after them had greatly decreased thanks to him having attacked while Adenmaha flew narrowly. Tae Ho looked at a distant place instead of continuing to attack them.</p><br/><p>He could know Aphrodite\u2019s location even without having to use his \u2018eyes of the dragon\u2019. This was because her divinity was too strong.</p><br/><p>\u2018She\u2019s not chasing after us. It seems like she is certainly a God.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn spoke with relief and regret.</p><br/><p>Aphrodite was really strong inside of Cyprus, and especially inside her palace.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho had overcome Aphrodite\u2019s seduction once but he wasn\u2019t confident of doing it a second time.</p><br/><p>Fighting against Aphrodite inside Cyprus when his mental defense runes had been destroyed was like putting on a leash himself to become her slave.</p><br/><p>But that was only when he fought inside of Cyprus, and inside her palace.</p><br/><p>The reason Tae Ho provoked Aphrodite was partly because it was his true feelings and to drag her out of Cyprus.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho was confident on being able to overcome her seduction if they were outside her sacred force.</p><br/><p>But Aphrodite wasn\u2019t a fool just like Cuchulainn had said. She didn\u2019t cross the last line even though she was greatly enraged.</p><br/><p>She also knew that it was suicide to fight against Tae Ho without the power of seduction.</p><br/><p>\u2018But whatever the case, we accomplished our objective.\u2019</p><br/><p>They succeeded on rescuing Hephaestus. He was in a state that was no different from a corpse but they had Idun\u2019s golden apples. He would be able to recover somehow.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026.are, are we not there yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha barely managed to squeeze out her voice and asked. She was just concentrating on flying so she didn\u2019t know how far away they were from Cyprus or if Aphrodite was still attacking them.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, it should be fine now.\u2019</p><br/><p>Their enemy had given up on chasing them.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho also thought like that. He touched Adenmaha\u2019s scales softly and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine now. It seems like they gave up chasing after us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha let out a sigh of relief. It was because she was right before the point of fainting.</p><br/><p>She stumbled a bit because her nervousness faded away but it only lasted a moment. She regained her composure back and inhaled a few times and then called Tae Ho shyly.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut master.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUm\u2026 you know. What you said before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>He had said a truck of words to her while they were escaping. Adenmaha let out a groaning sound as Tae Ho asked back but then managed to speak once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, am I really prettier than Freya-nim?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho laughed back unconsciously at her question filled with embarrassment and shy expectation. He touched Adenmaha\u2019s scales again and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true. In my eyes, Adenmaha is much prettier than mere beings like Aphrodite or Freya-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was true. It wasn\u2019t to provoke Aphrodite.</p><br/><p>\u201cHhph!\u201d</p><br/><p>But it was then. Adenmaha let out a weird sound again and stumbled but she couldn\u2019t fly up again. She started to crash down.</p><br/><p>\u2018You crazy bastard! She fainted!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I didn\u2019t use the rune?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018You won\u2019t get satisfied if you don\u2019t hit the final blow?! Huh?!\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn despaired and Tae Ho activated his saga hurriedly with a pale face.</p><br/><p>And only Adenmaha found peace in the middle of this chaos. She started to crash down while putting a happy smile.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 59 \u2013 God of conquest (5) &gt; End</p><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/>\n</div>"}

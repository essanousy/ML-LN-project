Even if the personal capabilities of Zeus and Chronos was equal, the forces they commanded couldn\u2019t be compared at all.</p><br/><p>Zeus commanded countless nymphs who raised him but among them there was none that could go out to battle.</p><br/><p>Zeus was put in a situation where he needed to defeat Chronos and his forces alone.</p><br/><p>Yet somehow Zeus succeeded in doing just that.</p><br/><p>He rescued his siblings from Chronos and gathered the rebelling titans to create a force of his own. He destroyed Chronos\u2019 army that seemed like it had no flaws, and changed the Titanomachy into an internal war between the children of Chronos and the other titans.</p><br/><p>In such a terrible situation, Zeus was able to win. He faced an overwhelming enemy and completed an impossible task.</p><br/><p>The situation now was similar.</p><br/><p>Even though his body was stolen and soul devoured by Nyx, the ancient God of night.</p><br/><p>He maintained himself. He didn\u2019t lose himself.</p><br/><p>And finally, when a single opportunity showed itself. Just like when he waited for an opportunity to counterattack Chronos, he also struck a blow against Nyx.</p><br/><p>Nyx screamed.</p><br/><p>Her beautiful appearance as a Goddess still remained but the aura of Zeus seeped out. The purity of Nyx lessened like dropping a drop of ink in pure water.</p><br/><p>Nyx staggered back.She could handle the power of the world, but like Odin saw, she wasn\u2019t a true World God.</p><br/><p>She was merely an ancient God who temporarily gained the ability to handle the power of the world by connecting the power of the primeval Gods.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why she wasn\u2019t invincible or omnipotent. She could call tens of thousands of lightning bolts with a gesture of her hand and tear apart any strong magic, but she couldn\u2019t suppress Zeus who was trying to wrest back control over his soul and body.</p><br/><p>\u201cNyx!\u201d</p><br/><p>The voice of Zeus boomed from Nyx\u2019s mouth. Mount Olympus reacted at his voice. The 12 Olympians called out to their king and offered him their divine power. They transferred their strength to Zeus.</p><br/><p>Cracks began to appear on several parts of Nyx\u2019s body. White light shone out of her body covered by a dark blue dress.</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up! Shut up! Just disappear!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nyx yelled and released an overwhelming strength. She smashed down Mount Olympus that reacted at Zeus\u2019 yell, and shook off the power of the 12 Olympians that was transmitted to Zeus.</p><br/><p>Odin and Thor, who lacked the power to resist, groaned. Bracky and Siri collapsed to the ground.</p><br/><p>But Tae Ho remained unaffected. He swung the shining Sword of the round table and split the Nyx\u2019s power. He then advanced and charged towards Nyx.</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nyx cursed and held Astrape tightly. She exploded with power and tried to tear Tae ho apart.</p><br/><p>But her arms didn\u2019t move. Someone was holding her down.</p><br/><p>\u201cZeus!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Disperse! Right now Nyx and I are one person!]</p><br/><p>he yell of Zeus rang in the mount.</p><br/><p>It was like he had said. Nyx and Zeus currently shared one soul and body. If Zeus\u2019 soul vanished,Nyx\u2019s soul would also extinguish.</p><br/><p>But of course, it wasn\u2019t that Nyx didn\u2019t have a way to escape. She was borrowing his body so she just had to give it up and leave.</p><br/><p>But that meant giving up the power of the World God.</p><br/><p>Zeus\u2019 soul and body were connecting the power of the primeval Gods into one. He was the core of the sacred force.</p><br/><p>[You can\u2019t escape.]</p><br/><p>[I won\u2019t allow it!]</p><br/><p>The voice of Zeus made Mount Olympus silent once again. Zeus grabbed Nyx\u2019s soul and immobilized it.</p><br/><p>He would die here. But he would take Nyx down with him.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho roared and charged. Nyx struggled in vain and screamed.</p><br/><p>Kwagang!</p><br/><p>The Sword of the round table and Astrape clashed. Nyx barely managed to regain control of Zeus\u2019 body at the last second.</p><br/><p>But Zeus didn\u2019t relent. He confronted Nyx once again. Tae Ho swung the Sword of the round table and pushed away Astrape. Nyx couldn\u2019t defend properly and staggered back.</p><br/><p>Nyx screamed. Even her shout contained the power of the world in it so it swept everything in its surroundings. She was still superior in pure strength.</p><br/><p>But Nyx knew. She knew it was impossible to win like this. Even if she could handle the power of the world, she still had a limit.</p><br/><p>This forced Nyx to think differently. Instead of suppressing everyone she summoned her followers from the darkness. She fused the power of the primeval Gods into one so she could control all the primeval Gods, except for Gaia, as her minions.</p><br/><p>But she didn\u2019t stop there. She also distributed the power of the world to Aphrodite and Dionysus who were still on her side. She ordered them to climb to the peak of the mount and help her.</p><br/><p>Monsters appeared in the night sky. The primeval Gods all possesed different appearances and sizes. It was a strange group that seemed as if they were picked from the sea of chaos.</p><br/><p>These Gods attacked the enemies of Nyx. They suppressed Odin, Thor, Bracky and Siri who were trying to stand up.</p><br/><p>Aphrodite covered the mount of Olympus with the power of seduction. She bewitched countless people and headed to the peak. Dionysius, who was at her side, planted madness upon all on the battlefield. He then made these mad warriors charge.</p><br/><p>Nyx smirked. She looked at her followers Tae Ho and took a breath.</p><br/><p>The moment of danger had passed. The situation had gone astray more than she expected, but she could easily eliminate the problems.</p><br/><p>She would buy time with her followers.</p><br/><p>She would completely suppress Zeus while the master of Asgard and Erin was tied down.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t matter if her followers fell too quickly. By then Aphrodite and Dionysus would have already arrived.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why it was enough. She had to concentrate on Zeus for now.</p><br/><p>Nyx closed her eyes. She located Zeus deep in her soul and suppressed him. It was something like creating a rainstorm and sinking down a ship that was roaming with no direction.</p><br/><p>Her followers stabbed Bracky who was on the floor embracing Siri. Siri yelled at him to get away quickly but Bracky didn\u2019t move an inch. He used himself as a shield to protect Siri.</p><br/><p>Odin could barely resist. He suffered many injuries from Nyx\u2019s followers. Thor hurriedly swung Mjolnir to save Odin, but Thor also had his limits. He couldn\u2019t face all the enemies flooding in like a wave. He and Odin would get trampled in no time.</p><br/><p>The warriors of Valhalla fell to Aphrodite\u2019s seduction. Dionysius planted seeds of madness in them and removed their rationality. The warriors of Valhalla attacked each other.</p><br/><p>The cracked night sky started to recover. Once again darkness began to devour the sky. .</p><br/><p>It turned like Nyx thought. Only a moment. She would be able to suppress Zeus in a little bit more. Complete victory was within grasp.</p><br/><p>But she was also wrong this time. There were still people defying her plans.</p><br/><p>\u201cO-din-!\u201d</p><br/><p>Odin blocked the advance of Aphrodite. She was the Goddess of magic and at the same time the Goddess of love and beauty.</p><br/><p>Freya didn\u2019t listen to Odin. She refused to believe that Odin would throw his life away to buy time for her to escape. She convinced Tyr and Ullr to release her and climbed up to the peak together.</p><br/><p>\u201cFoolish bitch.\u201d</p><br/><p>Aphrodite glared at Freya and said. The two were similar in power before Nyx descended but the situation had changed now. Aphrodite had the power of the world that Nyx gave her.</p><br/><p>But Freya didn\u2019t mind, because she was the keeper of Valhalla. She was the commander of the Valkyries and at the same time a God of Asgard!</p><br/><p>She was the same as Odin. She didn\u2019t know what giving up was. She had the courage to face against anything.</p><br/><p>Ullr and Tyr aided her with their strength. They endured the seduction of Aphrodite and stopped Aphrodite\u2019s march.</p><br/><p>Athena stood up from the opposite parth. The Goddess of warfare, actually the only battle God left among the 12 Olympians, gathered the strength of the Gods of Olympus into one place. Even at the risk of losing her own divinity, she exploded with that strength.</p><br/><p>Her home Olympus and that\u2019s why she couldn\u2019t stay standing still. She had to protect Olympus as its Goddess of warfare.</p><br/><p>Athena charged towards Dionysius and stopped his army. She then yelled out loud and called the name of her father again.</p><br/><p>Kwagagagagang!</p><br/><p>Thunder flashed.</p><br/><p>For a moment, white light filled the night sky.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t the thunder of Thor or Bracky, but those from the ruler of Olympus, Zeus.</p><br/><p>These bolts even contained the power of the world. Zeus had released the power of the world just like Nyx could.</p><br/><p>Dozens of enemies perished with that attack and once again a crack appeared in the night sky.</p><br/><p>In the middle of the chaos Tae Ho raised his Sword of the round table. He saw clearly with his \u2018eyes of the dragon\u2019.</p><br/><p>In this crazy situation he grasped an opening Zeus.</p><br/><p>There was a fatal flaw. Zeus discovered the connector of the night when he wielded a part of the power of the world.</p><br/><p>\u201cNooooo-!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nyx screamed and extended her hand but Tae Ho was faster than her. He stabbed the ground and amplified the power of the sun. He gathered that light and pierced the night sky with one attack!</p><br/><p>A huge crack appeared in the night. The eternal night was brought to an end. The connection between the primeval Gods began to disappear one by one.</p><br/><p>Nyx fell in chaos.</p><br/><p>And Tae Ho didn\u2019t miss that moment. He pierced the night sky it was impossible to disperse it completely with only one attack. Utlimately, Tae Ho and Zeuz\u2019 aim was to destroy Zeus\u2019 body and annihilate Nyx.</p><br/><p>Nyx realized their plan. She attacked Tae Ho but Zeus once again obstructed her. Astrape didn\u2019t move and the Sword of the round table pierced her chest.</p><br/><p>Nyx screamed. It wasn\u2019t from a fear of dying. It was from rage of someone who lost something precious.</p><br/><p>Nyx left Zeus\u2019 body. The moment the Sword of the round table stabbed his chest, she escaped his body.</p><br/><p>Zeus\u2019 body returned to normal. Zeus suffered a critical wound from the Sword of the round table but he was still breathing. It was thanks to Tae Ho having sensed Nyx escape with his \u2018eyes of the dragon\u2019 and weakening his strike at the last moment.</p><br/><p>Zeus breathed roughly and looked at the sky.</p><br/><p>The night sky was shattering. The monsters attacking Odin, Thor, Bracky and Siri disappeared like smoke.</p><br/><p>This was because Nyx gave up Zeus\u2019 body. Nyx was the one maintaining the night with the body of Zeus, not Zeus himself.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho looked at the dissipating night sky and then took out a golden apple of Idun, crushed it into pieces and fed it to Zeus.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho knew.</p><br/><p>The night was over but the battle wasn\u2019t. There was still one more enemy to defeat.</p><br/><p>\u2018She\u2019s coming.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn said. She was approaching for an attack.</p><br/><p>The Goddess of night Nyx.</p><br/><p>After giving up on Zeus\u2019 body, she formed a body and a soul like Gaia did. She was forced to give up half her power as an ancient God, but she still did that. She descended to the peak of the mount of Olympus once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t forgive you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nyx said, and two other primeval Gods landed next to her.</p><br/><p>The God of darkness Erebos, and the God of the underworld Tartarus. They also decided to make a body and soul like Nyx.</p><br/><p>They lost the power of the world. The current ancient Gods were only a bit stronger than the 12 Olympians.</p><br/><p>But they could win.</p><br/><p>With the golden apple, Zeus was hanging onto life by a thread. .</p><br/><p>Odin and Thor were really exhausted and Bracky was half dead.</p><br/><p>The most important thing was that Tae Ho had weakened. He had poured most of his strength into the last attack to destroy the night.</p><br/><p>Nyx gritted her teeth. Erebos and Tartarus raised their weapons.</p><br/><p>Now that she descended into the world in the flesh she couldn\u2019t become a World God anymore. She was restrained by her flesh and soul like Gaia, and couldn\u2019t even use all her power as an ancient God.</p><br/><p>This caused a really big sense of loss. It was a feeling Nyx couldn\u2019t endure as she had already climbed to the boundary of the Word God once.</p><br/><p>\u201cDie. Die and disappear.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nyx glared at Tae Ho. She screamed at the only one standing and released her strength and rage at the same time.</p><br/><p>Those bastards of Asgard.</p><br/><p>Those bastards of another world.</p><br/><p>Kill them all. After everything concluded they would invade Asgard and destroy the world.</p><br/><p>\u201cGods of Asgard! You are going to die in Olympus!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nyx raised her head.</p><br/><p>That was the case. This land was Olympus. This was the peak of the mount of Olympus where all the energy of Olympus was concentrated.</p><br/><p>Nyx felt her strength surge. It was because she would receive support from the world.</p><br/><p>She would kill the Gods of Asgard.</p><br/><p>She would remove the Gods that left their world so they weren\u2019t able to receive even a little bit of support from it.</p><br/><p>Nyx breathed roughly. Once again she let out an enraged roar.here was only one thing left to do.</p><br/><p>But she couldn\u2019t move rashly. It was the same for Erebos and Tartarus.</p><br/><p>This was because after descending in the flesh, they felt an uneasy feeling piercing their chests.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho looked at the clear sky. Zeus allowed it as the ruler of Olympus, the king of Gods.</p><br/><p>And what he got able to do because of that.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho gathered up his dark blue divinity, rolled lightly and then activated it.</p><br/><p>[Saga: Hall of Valhalla]</p><br/><p>From now on this land will become Asgard.</p><br/><p>The dark blue divinity covered their surroundings. It enveloped Mount Olympus where the energy of Olympus was the strongest.</p><br/><p>Nyx\u2019s eyes bulged. Erebos and Tartarus froze in shock.</p><br/><p>Odin and Thor stood up. Bracky and Siri did the same. The world of Asgard gave strength to its members.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho felt the power of Asgard.</p><br/><p>He felt his strength increase and looked at Nyx. He spoke word that would make Cuchulainn cheer and Loki laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201cAncient Gods of Olympus. Welcome to Asgard.\u201d</p><br/><p>The master of Asgard.</p><br/><p>Nyx groaned.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 63 \u2013 Myth of a hero (2) &gt; End</p><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She, who had the power of foresight, made her words a prophecy.</p><br/><p>Scathach, who was covering herself with the leather of a wolf, walked her path alone. The road was too long and harsh. Scathach had overcome the trial that had lasted for nine nights and placed her spear in the deepest part of the Land of Darkness. It was in order to absorb the strength of life and death into it.</p><br/><p>Nine nights passed once again. Scathach was on guard against the specters that were looking at her from beyond the boundary and she became certain while looking at the white light that was emitted from the spear. It was just like she had planned.</p><br/><p>The strength of life dyed the spear in white and the strength of death was placed deep in the spear and planted a strong curse.</p><br/><p>Scathach named the white evil spear Gae Bolg and used it in the most important battles and the enemies of the Land of Darkness really feared the witch and the spear of death.</p><br/><p>However Scathach couldn\u2019t keep Gae Bolg forever. It was because she had given it to her disciple, Cu Chulainn, who she loved and treasured very much.</p><br/><p>Although Cu Chulainn brought the weapon of his master everywhere with him, he didn\u2019t always use it. Just like Scathach had done, he only used it in the most important moments and brought out Gae Bolg\u2019s real strength.</p><br/><p>Gae Bolg was shining in white. The missing parts of the spear were complemented by the light.</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t waste your strength. You have to end it now. Gae Bolg\u2019s real worth is to use a definitive attack to kill your enemy. You shouldn\u2019t use it as you please.\u2019</p><br/><p>There was magic in Cu Chulainn\u2019s voice. Tae Ho understood how to use Gae Bolg, thanks to Cu Chulainn\u2019s transmission, and naturally wielded its strength. The white light which was shining dimmed like a lie but Tae Ho could still feel its power.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho stayed at a distant place.. He saw a huge pirate ship approaching while flying in the sky. When he used the \u2018Eye of the Dragon\u2019 he saw that several red letters surged up from the ship.</p><br/><p>[Beast Ruler]</p><br/><p>[Underling of the Tyrant Bress: Midak]</p><br/><p>It was the clearest and reddest letters. When Tae Ho read it out loud Cu Chulainn said, \u2018He\u2019s one of the underlings of Bress. He doesn\u2019t only have the strength to control countless beasts naturally, but he can also transform into a monster himself. It seems as if it had been planning to mate with the sea serpent.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cu Chulainn showed him some more memories. The shape of a big and imposing warrior wearing bear fur showed up.</p><br/><p>Just like Tae Ho\u2019s saga gave strength to the ones he was riding on, Midak could greatly strengthen the beasts he was controlling.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho looked at the approaching ship and thought. He had discovered them first. There was also the possibility that they weren\u2019t even aware of Tae Ho and Gae Bolg.</p><br/><p>The most suitable method was sniping them or making a surprise attack.</p><br/><p>\u2018Sniping them is impossible.\u2019</p><br/><p>Although Gae Bolg had the shape of a spear, there were many hard points to use it as a throwing spear. Because of that, Cu Chulainn only used Gae Bolg in a short distance, just like a harpoon.</p><br/><p>As a result, the option with the highest possibility was the surprise attack.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho rolled his fingers in the air. They moved quickly, like pressing on the keyboard, and formulated a strategy.</p><br/><p>There was one thing he had thought of. It was a strategy he had already used in Dark Age once and had succeeded.</p><br/><p>Although the pirate ship was flying in the sky quickly there was still some time. Tae Ho hurriedly looked at everyone in the battlefield. He looked at Siri, fighting fiercely on top of Adenmaha, but it wouldn\u2019t be possible. To increase the success rate of his strategy he needed something more than simply flying up and quickly.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho rolled his eyes again. He discovered someone suitable and ran hurriedly towards that person.</p><br/><p>\u201cGandur!\u201d</p><br/><p>Gandur, who was fighting nearby while riding a white Silence, turned her head at Tae Ho\u2019s call. And then she frowned and said,\u201dWhat is it; those eyes are filled with desire as if the day had finally come.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did I -!\u201d</p><br/><p>As he refuted reflexively, Gandur laughed evilly. She approached Tae Ho immediately, as if it had been only a joke from the start.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Is it related to the enemy that\u2019s approaching?\u201d</p><br/><p>It really was Gandur. It seemed like she had already realized Midak\u2019s existence. Tae Ho spoke quickly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will explain it to you while we go. First, transform please.\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice and eyes were dead serious. However Gandur flinched and trembled.</p><br/><p>\u201cA-are you even aiming for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGandur!\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t the time to joke. Gandur also stopped talking and then sat down and transformed with a chant. Just like a Valkyrie of the God of Hunting, she didn\u2019t transform into a swan but into a big black hawk.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho hurriedly got on Gandur and activated the \u2018One That Controls Dragons\u2019. At that moment, Gandur let out an exclamation while trembling and then flew to the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe warrior that rode on a Valkyrie!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOhh! Finally!\u201d</p><br/><p>The warriors that were near Gandur yelled with shining eyes. Tae Ho proceeded to explain to Gandur instead of answering them and Gandur, who had understood Tae Ho\u2019s tactic, activated Ullr\u2019s blessing.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Gandur disappeared from the air. Just like a Valkyrie that Gods were dependent on, her stealth blessing was incomparable to the lowest-ranked warriors.</p><br/><p>But of course, some movements could still be grasped if they were checked thoroughly, but it was enough.</p><br/><p>Gandur continued to increase her speed. It seemed as if her objective wasn\u2019t the pirate ship that was approaching the battlefield, but high in the sky.</p><br/><p>Finally, they even flew higher than the pirate ship. It seemed like they hadn\u2019t noticed Gandur as planned, since they didn\u2019t change their trajectory.</p><br/><p>Gandur, who flew as if she was going to charge at the sun, took a big turn at one point. Tae Ho grabbed onto Gandur\u2019s neck tightly as she started to descend at an overwhelming speed and looked at the ship with the \u2018Eyes of the Dragon\u2019. He grasped Midak\u2019s location.</p><br/><p>At the prow, over the deck, where he could look down at the battlefield.</p><br/><p>Gandur\u2019s flight was really precise. Without even needing the help of Tae Ho\u2019s saga, she received Midak\u2019s location and found the best route possible.</p><br/><p>They only had one opportunity.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho gulped air. She might get angry because he only found her at times like this, but he called Idun\u2019s name. Idun\u2019s power, which was filled with affection, covered Tae Ho\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Gandur spoke quickly and precisely.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho jumped down off Gandur\u2019s back. Gandur got pushed back because of him and then turned her body and passed the pirate ship. Tae Ho kicked the air once again and descended to the destined place. He called Gae Bolg\u2019s name once again.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The rough landing created a loud sound. Only then did Midak notice Tae Ho, who had appeared in the air.Tae Ho stopped breathing. It was different to when he had been attacking the giant of Strength, Harad. Back then, he had activated Gae Bolg with Cu Chulainn\u2019s strength and not his own.</p><br/><p>But this time he had to do it with his own strength. He had to receive the least help he could from Cu Chulainn, who still hadn\u2019t completely recovered his strength since that attack.</p><br/><p>The \u2018Eyes of the Dragon\u2019 told him the place he had to stab. White light surged up from Gae Bolg and Scathach\u2019s blessing gave strength to Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>Midak opened his mouth and then let out a strange sound. But he couldn\u2019t hear him. He had put all his concentration to stab that point.</p><br/><p>Something interfered in the trajectory. Precisely speaking, an invisible wall had appeared in front of the spear.</p><br/><p>He would stop the charge of the spear for just a moment. Then he would twist his body however he could and dodge the spear.</p><br/><p>If it was a Fomoire at the level of Midak, it was possible. In that short moment, Tae Ho and Midak exchanged glances.</p><br/><p>They could both feel it. If Midak\u2019s plans succeeded, Tae Ho would die. Gae Bolg\u2019s one hit, one kill, required a lot of strength. The moment it missed, Tae Ho would become vulnerable.</p><br/><p>The tip of Gae Bolg reached the invisible wall.</p><br/><p>However, at that moment, a new strength was added to Gae Bolg.</p><br/><p>[Saga: The Charge of the Dragon]</p><br/><p>Draconic Ballista!</p><br/><p>Originally it was a technique meant to be a lance charge. However, he carried that charging power on Gae Bolg. Tae Ho\u2019s posture changed to that of throwing something.</p><br/><p>The invisible wall was torn off in an instant. Gae Bolg\u2019s charge, which became faster than ever, pierced Midak\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>A cry was heard. At the same time, Gae Bolg, which had carved to a deep place in Midak\u2019s chest, showed its power. Hundreds of thorns surged up from the tip of the spear and tore up everything. The white light was too powerful.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho dropped his right hand. It seemed like his arm would get broken at any moment. But it wasn\u2019t the time to be resting. Tae Ho gripped the Sword piece with his left hand. He swung the Sword of the Winter Wolf towards Midak, who was struggling until the end, even though his body was breaking.</p><br/><p>Midak\u2019s head rolled onto the ground. Midak\u2019s body, which was covered with a strong death curse, couldn\u2019t endure anymore and was destroyed.</p><br/><p>White light exploded once again. At the same time, a huge amount of red runes went to Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>A shocking feeling shook his chest. Although it may have been a delusion, he thought he could hear Idun\u2019s voice, which was filled with affection and gentleness.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho finally let out a sigh and turned around while dropping his right arm. Shock spread among Midak\u2019s underlings that were on top of the ship. Some of them seemed to not understand what had happened in front of their eyes.</p><br/><p>Finally, Tae Ho\u2019s help arrived. Gandur had turned around the pirate ship once after putting down Tae Ho and then she transformed into the shape of a human after returning and landed in front of Tae Ho. It was a really agile and elegant movement.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou did it. Shall we flee right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gandur looked at Tae Ho with admiring eyes and asked while laughing and Tae Ho shook his head. Cu Chulainn also added.</p><br/><p>\u2018If you caught the Captain you should take his ship.\u2019</p><br/><p>Although it was a really pirate-like phrase, it rather suited Cu Chulainn.</p><br/><p>\u2018In the first place, this is a treasure of Erin. So it\u2019s right for you, the successor of Erin, to have it.\u2019</p><br/><p>But to do that they needed to control the Fomoires on the ship. Tae Ho spoke to Gandur.</p><br/><p>\u201cBuy some time for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you trying to recover?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one thing, but I have something I should take.\u201d</p><br/><p>The thing Midak left wasn\u2019t only his body, which was broken thanks to the death curse.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so like you.\u201d Gandur laughed and after that she summoned two white Silences to her side and then glared at the Fomoires, while holding a big sword. The Fomoires couldn\u2019t even think of charging towards them, as they had suddenly lost their commander.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho entrusted his back to Gandur and approached Midak\u2019s corpse. He put Gae Bolg back in Unnir and as he activated the \u2018Eyes of the Dragon\u2019 he saw something that entered his eyesight.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t rainbow-colored. It also wasn\u2019t white gold, but normal gold.</p><br/><p>But he got a feeling in an instant.</p><br/><p>[Summoning Rock]</p><br/><p>It was one of the reasons why Midak was described as the Beast Ruler.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho held the summoning rock high.</p><br/><p>&lt; Intermediate Ranked Warrior (4) &gt; End</p><hr/><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/>\n</div>"}

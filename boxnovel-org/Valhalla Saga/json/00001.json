The Valkyries raised flags of various colors and urged the warriors, that entered through the door with thunderous cheers.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk! Ugh! Wait! Wait!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho wasn\u2019t even thinking of entering the door, but he didn\u2019t have a choice. As the huge sea of bodies started pushing him, there was no way he could resist. If he tried to go the other way or stop, he would fall down and get trampled over.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho got pushed forward tens of meters in an instant and looked at the only Valkyrie he knew; she was the one that had brought him here. He wanted to beg for something, but the black-haired Valkyrie put on a refreshing smile and said, \u201cWarrior! Welcome to Valhalla! Let\u2019s hope we meet again at the night banquet!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNight banquet?\u201d</p><br/><p>He asked a question but no reply could be heard. No, in the first place, his question was drowned out by the voices around him.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho gave up on trying to talk to the Valkyrie and just looked to the front. As the strength pushing behind him was still great, if he became careless for even a moment, he would die on the spot.</p><br/><p>\u2018Wait, am I not already dead?\u2019</p><br/><p>He thought that, but for now Tae Ho was focused on moving his feet because that was what his instinct was telling him to do. If it hurt when people pushed him, it was obvious that it would also hurt if he fell.</p><br/><p>The place beyond the door was so big that it was able to hold hundreds of people at once. The high ceiling was made out of rocks, the pillars were tall, and the place itself gave a big impression.</p><br/><p>There were also some Valkyries wearing armor inside the door, but they weren\u2019t warriors so they were lined up on another side of the wall. A high platform was placed in front of them.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is someone going to perform over there?\u2019</p><br/><p>As Tae Ho was walking and observing his surroundings, a rough voice spoke right next to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich battle did you die in?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho flinched, but fortunately, the question wasn\u2019t directed at him but at another man. The man that asked the question and the one that was asked looked like bears.</p><br/><p>The red-bearded man that was questioned started explaining his situation. Then the blue-bearded man sharply opened his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were the one that killed me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018What?\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho was surprised and so he turned to look back at them. Were they enemies that stood on the same battlefield?\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho shrank back because he thought that a fight would occur, but nothing happened. The red-bearded man patted the shoulders of the other man and stirringly said, \u201cKuhahat, know that you were able to come to Valhalla because of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuku, that was a good fight. But seeing that we are together, did you die after that?\u201d</p><br/><p>At the blue-bearded man\u2019s question, the red-bearded one frowned as if it was regrettable.</p><br/><p>\u201cI got done in by a young man with five braids. He pierced my stomach while yelling \u2018Father!\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026.Bjorg! You avenged your father!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018What is with this story.\u2019</p><br/><p>Simply put, the red beard killed the blue beard, and the son of the blue beard killed the red beard.</p><br/><p>He thought that a battle was obviously going to start, but once again nothing happened.</p><br/><p>The red beard patted his belly and said while laughing: \u201cMan, you raised your son really well! For him to pierce my belly like that. He will become a great warrior! No, he\u2019s already one!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKukuku. Thanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>The red beard and blue beard patted each other\u2019s shoulders and laughed. If you just looked at them you would think that they were lifelong friends instead of enemies.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho decided to stop thinking at that point. It seemed like this place really was the Valhalla that appeared in myths from northern Europe.</p><br/><p>\u2018But why me?\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho had never held a sword, nor a dagger. He had never experienced a battle where he had to put his life at stake, why was he dragged here?</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s surely a mistake. Right? A mistake?\u2019</p><br/><p>While Tae Ho was in grief, the sound of the horn trumpet rang again. The warriors that were chatting amongst themselves became silent and turned to look at where the Valkyries were. A Valkyrie with long, blonde hair was on the platform that was empty until moments ago. Perhaps she had a high status among Valkyries, as her armor and helmet were different from the others.</p><br/><p>\u201cWarriors! I welcome you to Valhalla!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUooooo!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOdin!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThor!\u201d</p><br/><p>The hundreds of gathered warriors let out cheers. The sound was so loud that it seemed like the entire hall was shaking.</p><br/><p>The Valkyrie standing on the platform put on a satisfied smile and then raised the sword that was resting on her waist.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am the Valkyrie Reginleif! I have prepared a banquet to welcome you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOhh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Banquet? Is it that night banquet they spoke of before?\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho remembered the words of the black-haired Valkyrie. First, he would have to sit down and ask some questions to know what his situation was like.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut unfortunately, something has happened. Exalted warriors, are you ready to fight for Asgard and the nine linked planets?!\u201d</p><br/><p>At Reginleif\u2019s words, Tae Ho abruptly opened his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2018Did something happen? Ready to fight?</p><br/><p>\u2018You don\u2019t mean\u2026?!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cWicked enemies have invaded us with a huge army! You all are already excellent and exalted warriors to be invited to Valhalla! Grab your weapons and let us go to the battlefield!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUooo!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, wait, wait!\u201d</p><br/><p>That last one was Tae Ho, but his voice was mixed in with the confusion from the other cries.</p><br/><p>Reginleif turned her sword over her head with a cool motion and then pointed at the huge door.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo! Get on the ships! They will lead you to the battlefield!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUoooo!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOdin!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>The warriors started to move in unison. Tae Ho was just like a pebble in a stream \u2014 he couldn\u2019t get out.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>\u2018This is crazy!\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho was sat in a corner of the big deck.</p><br/><p>It was absurd enough to be dead and be dragged to Valhalla, but he even had to go to the battlefield as soon as he had arrived. The warriors that were on the ship were enjoying the cloudy sea, but Tae Ho couldn\u2019t do so at all. He would like it if someone explained what was happening to him, even if it wasn\u2019t a pretty Valkyrie.</p><br/><p>It was right then when someone said something to him: \u201cYoung man.\u201d</p><br/><p>A big shadow was cast over his head. Tae Ho raised his head and saw a tall man with ash colored hair. The man smiled when he made eye contact with Tae Ho and then lowered himself to his eye level.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are overly nervous. Don\u2019t worry. These battles are not that different to what you were doing until now. I have already been on this battlefield numerous times.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man spoke like that and then pointed at his chest. There was one accessory made of feathers and it looked like it was a kind of medal.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho reflexively asked, \u201cWhat are we fighting against?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWicked demons, giants, devils\u2026..They are all enemies threatening Asgard and the nine planets.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man answered with a gallant face. It was doubtful if he could even fight against a person, but to top that off, demons and giants? And even devils?</p><br/><p>Tae Ho breathed in and out as he started to feel dizzy. Only after that could he barely ask a question:</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you die, what happens?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho was already dead. So what would happen if he died once again in this state?</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung man, is that really a question? Didn\u2019t we obtain a new body here in Valhalla? If you die this time, it will mean death for real.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had his doubts, but it really was the case. As Tae Ho\u2019s expression became grim, the man laughed and added,</p><br/><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t worry too much. We have at least one insurance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAn insurance?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you see those friends?\u201d</p><br/><p>As he turned to look in the direction that the man was pointing at, he could see big overall armors lined up.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe warriors of Valhalla that die in the battlefield \u2014 the souls of the warriors are moved to the steeled soldiers. The Einherjar. So you can keep fighting in that state! What\u2019s more surprising is that the steeled warriors don\u2019t feel pain or exhaustion. They only exist to fight!\u201d</p><br/><p>He spoke as if it was cool, but for Tae Ho, it wasn\u2019t cool at all. To exist just to fight without having any senses. What was the difference between that and a piece of metal?</p><br/><p>He had to live. He couldn\u2019t afford to die. He couldn\u2019t die like this.</p><br/><p>While Tae Ho was making a pledge by himself, the man turned to look at Tae Ho again.</p><br/><p>\u201cAbove that, don\u2019t you use a saga?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Saga?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are a warrior worthy of being called to Valhalla. You surely have amazing prestige or a great achievement. The saga is the song of the warrior, the strength of magic. The more it is transmitted and believed in, the strength of the warrior becomes stronger. Think of your own saga. It will surely give you strength to enable you to fight on the battlefield.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy\u2026..saga?\u201d</p><br/><p>Story. Transmission.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, my saga is \u2018The rock fist that caught a bear\u2019. My fists are a bit hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man smiled and clenched his fist. It was really as big and hard like a rock.</p><br/><p>But it didn\u2019t end there. It seemed like the fist of the man was shining. Then, it became twice as big.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou try it too, young man. Think of the achievements you have accomplished.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man smiled and extended his fist. However, it was merely a perplexing thing for Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>An achievement as a warrior? A feat?</p><br/><p>There was no way a pro gamer would have those kinds of things.</p><br/><p>\u2018No, wait.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho certainly wasn\u2019t a warrior.</p><br/><p>But he was the world\u2019s best pro gamer. The dragon knight Kalsted, which he used in the world of Dark Age, was the legend itself.</p><br/><p>His achievements.</p><br/><p>His story.</p><br/><p>All of the achievements dragon knight Kalsted had made.</p><br/><p>[ Saga: Immortal Warrior ]</p><br/><p>A shining sentence appeared in front of Tae Ho\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>&lt; Immortal Warrior (1) &gt; End</p><br/>\n</div>"}

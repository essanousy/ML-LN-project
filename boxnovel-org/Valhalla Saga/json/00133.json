You have done well. Your merits are really incredible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Odin\u2019s words were quite calm as if he already knew that Tae Ho was coming.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, he\u2019s the King of Gods.\u2019</p><br/><p>Even if he didn\u2019t have Hugin and Munin, he was still the King of Gods. He couldn\u2019t see a thousand miles away like Hermod or hear the sound of a sheep\u2019s fur growing, but he had experience and wisdom that no other God was able to catch up to.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho wasn\u2019t the only one that showed no signs for nine days.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg also didn\u2019t show any kind of reaction. It just remained lying down.</p><br/><p>It was also the first time that Odin had come down the root, but he still heard its roars from the lake of Mimir. It never happened that the roar stopped for nine days.</p><br/><p>Because of that, Odin didn\u2019t think that Tae Ho failed, and his guess was spot on.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho explained briefly how he\u2019d suppressed Nidhogg and its current state.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a story that\u2019s hard to believe.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other things were secondary, but Nidhogg\u2019s nature was really hard to believe because the dragon was an evil one that would bring destruction by emanating its nasty poison across the realms.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s all true.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn, who had materialized thanks to Odin\u2019s magic, stepped up.</p><br/><p>His insight with the Scathach-style techniques could see through an act or lies at a glance.</p><br/><p>Odin stayed silent for a moment instead of agreeing.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho, who gazed at Odin, opened his mouth carefully.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Odin, there\u2019s something I want to ask.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeak.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it impossible to bring Nidhogg with us? It will certainly be of help in driving away the giants from Asgard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho brought a realistic excuse instead of pity.</p><br/><p>He was thinking about getting out of the roots, but not everything would be solved by doing so.</p><br/><p>They needed a way to suppress the World Wolf and drive away the giants.</p><br/><p>You could say that the body of Nidhogg, that spanned 2 kilometers, was an incredible force by itself. The problem was that it didn\u2019t know how to fight at all, but time would solve that.</p><br/><p>In addition, Tae Ho had the \u2018One that Controls Dragons\u2019. If he controlled its body and fought, he would be able to display a tenth of its incredible battle prowess.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho knew well that Odin disliked Nidhogg, but even so, he couldn\u2019t give up on her that easily.</p><br/><p>Odin didn\u2019t answer immediately. He kept silent for a while longer and then closed his only eye and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cI think you are a bit dazzled.\u201d</p><br/><p>The opponent was an ancient dragon.</p><br/><p>It was one of the several existences that could bring a world to its end.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou may be looking at this matter with prejudice, but I thought of this with what you told me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Odin opened his eye again and looked at Tae Ho fixedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did it appear with the shape of a woman?\u201d</p><br/><p>A white woman with long black hair that reached her waist.</p><br/><p>A mature, beautiful, and poor woman that stimulated Tae Ho\u2019s compassion.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut of course, that may be its real body. An ancient dragon is the same existence as a God, so there\u2019s a high probability it was born with the shape of a human like most Gods. But you can also think of it in this way-\u201d</p><br/><p>Odin paused for a moment. He spoke about humanoids, giants included, but then he remembered about the existences hoping for the end of the world and said once again,</p><br/><p>\u201cJust like you have seen its memory, it would have also seen yours. That\u2019s why it may have chosen the best shape to pull your compassion and carelessness. Isn\u2019t it weird? The fact that an ancient dragon that has lived for thousands of years chose the shape of a woman to appear in front of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho flinched. It wasn\u2019t because he\u2019d been persuaded by Odin\u2019s words. It was because the ill interpretation blocked all words from him.</p><br/><p>But if he took a look at it from a step further, Odin\u2019s words were quite reasonable.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho couldn\u2019t answer immediately. It was because he thought only negative words would come out in response.</p><br/><p>Odin didn\u2019t urge Tae Ho, and Cuchulainn opened his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Odin, can I say something?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeak, Prince of Light.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand what you are thinking about, and what you said also has some possibilities. But I thought of another thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Odin opened his eye sharply. Cuchulainn looked at Odin fixedly just like he had done and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe reason it chose the shape of a human may be because it saw Tae Ho\u2019s memories and thoughts. Perhaps it may have been an instinctive judgement. What shape would suit the best with Tae Ho. What shape did it have to take to interact with Tae Ho more easily.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn thought of Nidhogg that was playing affectionately in Tae Ho\u2019s embrace. If Nidhogg hadn\u2019t chosen the shape of a human and stayed in the shape of a dragon, would it have been able to still play affectionately in Tae Ho\u2019s embrace?</p><br/><p>\u201cRather than a dragon, that is many times bigger than a human. It would have been much easier to communicate as a human. In addition, just like you said, it saw Tae Ho\u2019s memories. It must have known well how much this trash\u2026..no, this bastard likes women.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Cuchulainn?!\u2019</p><br/><p>He was doing well, but what was he saying suddenly?</p><br/><p>As Tae Ho protested inwardly, Cuchulainn rebuked him in the same way.</p><br/><p>\u2018Stay still you bastard. Did I lie? Do you like women or not? Huh? You can\u2019t say no, right?\u2019</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a punishment for nothing.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho pressed down his boiling rage and unfairness, and Cuchulainn concentrated on the conversation with Odin once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut of course, those are merely probabilities. It\u2019s only a guess. But if I have to say, I think that what you said is also merely a guess. I hope you make a judgement after you see Nidhogg for yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPrince of Light, you are really arrogant.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cForgive my rudeness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn put a faint smile and bowed.</p><br/><p>Odin dropped his shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. You are arrogant, but your words aren\u2019t wrong. Perhaps, I may have become too narrow-minded as I only perceive the world with a single eye.\u201d</p><br/><p>Odin wasn\u2019t a perfect existence.</p><br/><p>The case with the World Wolf was one example of this.</p><br/><p>If they had succeeded in resurrecting the World Wolf, there was no need to hide it. They would have placed it on the battlefield immediately.</p><br/><p>He fell in a childish, fixed concept and suffered for it, and the result of it was that he got trapped in the roots.</p><br/><p>As Odin twisted his thoughts by his own accord, Cuchulainn revealed a bitter smile. He was happy that his words had worked, but it was painful to see a king without his wings.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun\u2019s warrior, just like you and Cuchulainn had said, I will have to see Nidhogg for myself. We need its help to get out of here anyway.\u201d</p><br/><p>His wounds had healed up quite a bit the past nine days, but it was still uncomfortable to move. It was not possible to ride on Tae Ho\u2019s back after he transformed into a hawk.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about methods for me to move. I will engrave dragon transformation runes, so come closer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho told Odin to wait for a moment when he made a gesture and used the \u2018Warrior that had a Valkyrie Meet Him.\u2019</p><br/><p>[Fake Heda]</p><br/><p>[Fake Ingrid]</p><br/><p>As two fake Valkyries appeared in front of Tae Ho, Odin put on a really surprised face. It was because he had seen through the saga Tae Ho possessed at one glance.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a really impressive saga. The origin is also amazing. I can see how much affection Heda holds for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because the saga started and was completed by Heda\u2019s meeting.</p><br/><p>The fake Valkyries lowered their heads in front of Odin, and Odin engraved a rune in each of their collar bones.</p><br/><p>Dragon transformation rune.</p><br/><p>As the Valkyries yelled the activation code, the two of them transformed into small dragons of around 5 meters in size.</p><br/><p>It seemed like their color took the color of their hair that Heda was a red scaled dragon and Ingrid was a golden one.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho helped Odin get on the fake Ingrid and then he got on top of the fake Heda. And then Cuchulainn said casually,</p><br/><p>\u2018Hey, it\u2019s a one-use anyways, so couldn\u2019t you just summon Heda?\u2019</p><br/><p>The dragon wasn\u2019t small enough that two people couldn\u2019t get on it.</p><br/><p>\u2018No, but still.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Why? even if it\u2019s fake, only you can ride on it? Huh?\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn laughed and asked. In the first place, it seemed like he had spoken to make fun of him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s go quickly.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho interrupted Cuchulainn\u2019s words and departed.</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>Tae Ho landed the fake Valkyries on the rock that was connected to the heart room.</p><br/><p>Originally, he would have needed to walk for a long time to get there, but there was no need to do so this time.</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho, master! You really came fast!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg, who was sitting on top of the rock, stood up while her eyes shone and then started to cry. It was because she was really grateful that Tae Ho had returned in only an hour.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tears of happiness are really beautiful.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn mumbled proudly and soothed Nidhogg. In the first place, Nidhogg stopped crying as soon as she embraced Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d</p><br/><p>Odin, who had seen their exchange, said. It was brief, but there were several emotions mixed in with his voice.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg looked at Odin while leaning on Tae Ho\u2019s chest. There was curiousness and fear in her eyes.</p><br/><p>Odin could know that reason, and because of that, he said to Nidhogg.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome closer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg flinched at the low call. She just stuck her face closer to Tae Ho and didn\u2019t move closer to Odin.</p><br/><p>Because of that, Tae Ho slightly separated her from him and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. He\u2019s a good person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYe-yeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg groaned a few times but then approached Odin after nodding carefully.</p><br/><p>One step, two steps. Nidhogg, who was walking hesitantly, turned to look at Tae Ho and then increased her speed. She stopped right in front of Odin and sat down.</p><br/><p>Odin observed her actions. He looked at her black eyes and asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cNidhogg, do you know who I am?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo but I feel like I do. Scary. You are a scary person.\u201d</p><br/><p>Odin\u2019s face wasn\u2019t in Nidhogg\u2019s memories, but she somehow felt a natural familiarity and fear from him.</p><br/><p>A person that wasn\u2019t in her memories but felt like she had certainly met him before.</p><br/><p>She was scared. Fearful. It wasn\u2019t familiar to her at all.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg shrugged her shoulders and turned her head as if evading Odin\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Odin opened his only eye sharply and thought,</p><br/><p>\u2018She\u2019s in the middle.\u2019</p><br/><p>Between the one wanting to maintain the world and the one hoping for its destruction.</p><br/><p>The black dragon, Nidhogg, was born with both of those attributes, and the one that developed more was the one that hoped to maintain the world.</p><br/><p>But it was dyed with another color.</p><br/><p>If one compared the version wanting to maintain the world with white and the version wanting to destroy it as black, Nidhogg wasn\u2019t black, white, nor even gray. It was a mixture of the two.</p><br/><p>Half in white, and the other half in black.</p><br/><p>She was a dragon that wanted to maintain the world but was leaning towards the one that wanted to destroy it.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is this also fate?\u2019</p><br/><p>If they had left her alone, Nidhogg would have completely become a being that wanted to destroy the world.</p><br/><p>But Tae Ho had appeared.</p><br/><p>Just like Odin gave a rank among Gods to Loki and pulled him to the side that wanted to maintain the world, Tae Ho also controlled Nidhogg with the \u2018One that Controls Dragons\u2019 and led her to his side.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt would have been better if they\u2019d met before.\u201d</p><br/><p>He never thought that Nidhogg would be in such state.</p><br/><p>He ended up hearing the roars from the lake of Mimir and judged it rashly.</p><br/><p>It was born an evil dragon. It\u2019s roars were filled with rage towards the world.</p><br/><p>But that wasn\u2019t the case. The roars of Nidhogg weren\u2019t filled with rage, but with loneliness.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Odin extended his hand and stroke her head. She pulled her body back reflexively the moment he extended his hand, but then accepted it. She slightly bowed as a puppy being stroked and closed her eyes.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho let out a sigh of relief at that sight. He transmitted his words to Odin with mystical magic.</p><br/><p>\u2018Odin, pardon my rudeness. Am I able to bring Nidhogg with me?\u2019</p><br/><p>The reason he had spoken to him in such a method was to prepare for when it wasn\u2019t possible. Because Nidhogg could get hurt with such expectations.</p><br/><p>Odin smiled bitterly at his consideration. Idun was one thing, but her warrior was also too soft; however, Odin didn\u2019t seem to dislike that softness.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust like I said before, it\u2019s impossible with our strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg opened her eyes while wondering what he was speaking about. Tae Ho gulped dry saliva and waited for Odin\u2019s next words.</p><br/><p>It was because his words were heard differently from before.</p><br/><p>Impossible with our strength.</p><br/><p>That was a clue. Another being may exist that could help them.</p><br/><p>If it only wasn\u2019t with their strength.</p><br/><p>If someone\u2019s help was added.</p><br/><p>\u201cRatatoskr.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg spoke at that moment. She raised her head and stood up.</p><br/><p>\u201cRatatoskr! Ratatoskr is coming!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg said happily. She always got hurt by Ratatoskr, but it still was her only companion to talk with. Even words that ripped her heart were valuable to her.</p><br/><p>\u2018It finally came.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn said in a cold voice, and Tae Ho also looked up the sky with cold eyes.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t see it yet, but it was definitely coming. The sound of footsteps were heard as before.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no time. Listen to what I say well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Odin gathered everyone\u2019s attention and then started to speak.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 38 \u2013 Ratatoskr (2) &gt; End</p><hr/><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/>\n</div>"}

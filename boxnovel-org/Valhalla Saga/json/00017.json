Why are they all looking at us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda said in a whisper, her face flushed. The place they were standing at was behind the gates that had been designated as the meeting place. At Heda\u2019s remark, Tae Ho glanced back at the gates. He felt as if he could feel the gazes of the warriors looking through the walls.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you really asking because you don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As Tae Ho glared down at her with sharp eyes, Heda cleared her throat and then changed the subject.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyway, are you fine? You aren\u2019t hurt?\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda\u2019s eyes moved over Tae Ho\u2019s head. It was obvious for her to be worried because he had his head covered with bandages.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho smiled bitterly and then shrugged his shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cHonestly, no. I\u2019m alive because of Idun\u2019s blessing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExplain it in detail.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho told her about the battle he had faced today. Heda opened her eyes roundly at the part when he hit the wall and when they got to the point about how Tae Ho killed Red Eyes, Heda cut short his words and approached him.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s look at your wounds.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Heda started to touch his shoulders, arms, hips and other parts of his body, Tae Ho let out a groan. It was because nowhere on him was safe.. After Heda placed her hands on his chest and recited some runes, she shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really are a mess. Wait a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda stepped back and then took out some white things from the pocket ather waist. After she opened one, a clean white rolled cloth came out, and after she spread that, four small white pieces, each about the size of a small pill, appeared.</p><br/><p>Heda extended her hand and said, \u201cEat one. You will feel much more comfortable.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a request from none other than Heda. After eating the piece that was to the left, he felt that it was crispy and sweet.</p><br/><p>\u2018Apple?\u2019</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t certain. He felt as if it was an apple, but it was so much more delicious that it wasn\u2019t comparable at all to the ones he had eaten up until now.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda smiled playfully and asked. Expectation filled her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it maybe\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho paused for a moment and then looked at himself. Energy started to fill his body. Reflexively, he started to touch his body, but he didn\u2019t feel hurt at all. As Tae Ho opened his eyes widely, Heda smiled with satisfaction and then whispered in Tae Ho\u2019s ear in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight \u2013 that\u2019s a piece of a golden apple.\u201d</p><br/><p>The golden apples that the Goddess of Youth administered \u2013 a treasure among treasures that gave eternal life to the Gods.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot anyone can eat this, so you have to keep it a secret. Understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda\u2019s expression and voice were more serious than playful. It seemed like he really had to keep it a secret.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it fine?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018If you give me this?\u2019</p><br/><p>At Tae Ho\u2019s question, Heda looked at their surroundings and then said in a low voice, \u201cIt\u2019s a really small piece, and you are Idun\u2019s warrior. It\u2019s fine, you just have to don\u2019t tell it to others. Idun also permitted it.\u201d</p><br/><p>None other than the one that administered the golden apples was the one that had permitted it.</p><br/><p>\u2018But it will still have to be a secret.\u2019</p><br/><p>If the golden apples were things meant only for the Gods, then Idun having permitted it was secondary, but the fact that it was exposed could make a fuss. Just like Heda had said, it would be better to keep quiet about it.</p><br/><p>\u2018Unexpectedly, Idun\u2019s legion has more good points.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho nodded to himself and then looked at his body again. His body had been hurting until now, but now he was overflowing with strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really marvelous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s the essence of life. Although the effects are weak because it was merely a piece, it will still cure you of curses and heal you easily. It also has an outstanding ability for beauty.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, so?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Heda tilted her head, Tae Ho just laughed it off.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, nothing. Anyway, thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Anyway, it certainly was a precious thing. He was thankful towards Heda that she wanted to take better care of him a little better than she could.</p><br/><p>\u201cEat it only when you need it, nd take it with you at all times. This pocket has preserving magic in it, so you just have to put it in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda put back the folded white cloth in the pocket and then placed it on Tae Ho\u2019s waist herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, you are keeping your saga a secret, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, although no one asked me about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was something he had decided with Heda the day before.</p><br/><p>He would keep the saga, Immortal Warrior, a secret.</p><br/><p>The stories recorded in the Immortal Warrior were all too outstanding. With a saga like this, persons like Odin and Thor would certainly become interested in him.</p><br/><p>The interest of Gods could become poison at times. And especially more so if Odin was the one interested.</p><br/><p>What would happen if he placed Tae Ho on an unreasonable battlefield, saying that he would awaken his saga? The warriors of Valhalla had to always stand on the battlefield. There was nowhere that was not dangerous, but there was no need to bring danger to yourself.</p><br/><p>And this was also something that Idun wanted.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, be careful,\u201d Heda warned him once again and then looked up at Tae Ho and said, \u201cWell, today we should also continue with what we were doing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean the classes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. But as we are in the middle of the banquet and the night is deep, I will keep it short and concise,\u201d Heda said as if asking what else was there to do and then looked Tae Ho up and down.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou earned a lot of runes this time, right? And also received the reward. Did you already invest them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I was in a hurry to strengthen myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had to become even a little bit faster and stronger to survive on the battlefield. There was no reason to keep them stored.</p><br/><p>Heda nodded. \u201cYou did well. Can I see how you invested them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs you wish.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Tae Ho agreed, Heda placed her palm on Tae Ho\u2019s chest again. She closed her eyes and seemed to be reading the runes, and then smiled brightly and said,\u201cYou invested them in an equal manner?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seemed like I needed all of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou thought well. What should I say; you are a warrior that\u2019s more like an all-rounder, so it\u2019s better to do what you did instead of focusing on one thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>In games, one would go with the Damage tree or the Tank tree, looking at the effectiveness, but this was the reality. In addition, Heda was thinking of a slow growth that implied raising all of your abilities equally instead of a dramatic growth.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, after what I faced yesterday I was thinking of doing an all-in in my health.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because if your health became stronger, it seemed as if your resistance towards shock also became stronger. However, Heda shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not too bad at the beginning, but don\u2019t invest all of your runes in that. You always have to keep in mind that you will be fighting alone. If your attacks don\u2019t even work on your opponent, it will be useless how much you can endure, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>She was right. And in the first place, that was the reason Tae Ho invested his runes equally. To go with the Extreme tree, he needed an ally to fill his weak points. He did fight with Rolph and the warriors of Ullr\u2019s legion in the battlefield, but that wouldn\u2019t always be the case. And the fights were rather more like repeated one on ones.</p><br/><p>That meant that he needed all of the abilities. Strength, health, and agility influenced your battle strength directly, and concentration and magic power influenced your saga. Of course, this method was slower than investing all of your runes to one stat, but it still had a solution.</p><br/><p>\u2018I just have to earn a lot of runes.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was the same as farming exp in games. He just had to earn a lot of runes and invest them.</p><br/><p>In addition, Tae Ho had the Immortal Warrior. Every time the synchro rate increased, he became more like Kalsted. Saying it briefly, all of his abilities increased. Now, even Tae Ho was expecting it. He could already imagine himself becoming stronger than Kalsted someday.</p><br/><p>As Tae Ho nodded with an excited face, Heda also nodded spiritedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd this, this is a reward from Idun.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun\u2019s?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. It increases your recovery rate. It\u2019s a special thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>What Heda took out was a golden necklace. There was a golden apple at the end of the necklace.</p><br/><p>Heda hung the necklace on Tae Ho and said, \u201cIdun was really happy. It has been a while since the warriors of Valhalla shouted Idun\u2019s name. She says she will be awaiting your performance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at how he had spoken, it seemed as if Idun didn\u2019t directly see how he fought. It seemed like there was a kind of system that could know when the warriors yelled their names.</p><br/><p>\u2018Uh\u2026mmm\u2026Idun? Next time, I will certainly yell your name.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho, who yelled Idun\u2019s name instead of Heda\u2019s, cleared his throat and then placed his hands on his waist as if he remembered.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Heda, what do I use the money on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can donate it to the legion, and you can use it for yourself,\u201d Heda answered. And it was his feeling but it felt as if she had emphasized the first part.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho laughed in a low voice and kept asking, \u201cIs there a place I can use it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course there is. Starting from the inferior rank, you are able to go to the stores that are in Valhalla. There are people that order weapons and armors for themselves, and there are also people that spend it on gambling places or in the red light district. There are various kinds of people. And of course, there are people that just donate it to their legion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda shone at the last part.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho asked instead, \u201cWhere will you use the donations?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cImprovement of living conditions for the members?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. I will think about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even if she said that Tae Ho was the only one.</p><br/><p>As Tae Ho stepped back, Heda put on a regretful face but it was only for a moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cWherever you use it, you just don\u2019t have to waste it. It seems like you still haven\u2019t received your reward; looking at the merits you have achieved today, you will also get rewarded tomorrow. I\u2019m telling you that you are amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho shrugged his shoulders and smirked. He had heard it many times when he was a pro gamer, but it was always nice to hear compliments.</p><br/><p>\u2018Anyways, the lowest ranked warriors really are treated as ordinary ones. You can\u2019t even go to the store alone.\u2019</p><br/><p>He understood why the warriors of Ullr\u2019s legion made that fuss with the inferior rank.</p><br/><p>\u201cI should be going back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda seemed to have a method to check the time when she looked up at the sky and approached Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cLower your head for a moment, I will bless you.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Tae Ho lowered his head, Heda got on her toes and placed her lips on Tae Ho\u2019s forehead.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet Idun\u2019s blessing be with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda stepped back after that and laughed and then waved her hand as she always did.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, did you have fun?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBjorn, why do I feel murderous intent from your words?\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t only in his words but also in the arm that was placed on Tae Ho\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just your feeling.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bjorn opened his eyes sharply and smirked and then the warriors in Siri\u2019s troop put on the same smile.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho got out of Bjorn\u2019s arm for now and then said, \u201cI just had some classes, classes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA one on one class with a Valkyrie?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The warriors gulped some air. It seemed like they had completely misunderstood. It was also like this when he came to Valhalla, but the warriors here were professionals when assuming things.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, so\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho, captain Siri is calling you.\u201d</p><br/><p>While everyone was focused on Tae Ho, Rolph stepped in and called him. His face was red because of the alcohol, but his expression was serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were warriors with familiar faces behind Rolph. It seemed like they were similarly called.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hurry.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Rolph turned back and started to walk away, the warriors of Siri\u2019s troop started to say words like \u2018so what happened!\u2019 but he could only leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cOver there.\u201d</p><br/><p>The place Rolph pointed at was near a burning Altar. And as they arrived there, there were a few more people beside Siri. And there was also someone even Tae Ho knew.</p><br/><p>Valkyrie Rasgrid.</p><br/><p>She, who was responsible for all of the warriors, looked at the gathered members and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry to call you in the middle of the banquet, but I have something to tell you. It\u2019s related to a special task.\u201d</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 5 \u2013 The night banquet (2) &gt; End</p><br/>\n</div>"}

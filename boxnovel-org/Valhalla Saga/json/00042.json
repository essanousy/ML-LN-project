They couldn\u2019t wear their armor, and that was the same for the accessories.</p><br/><p>Thanks to that, acquiring weapons from the enemies and retrieving weapons of your allies was an important thing.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is a killing.\u2019</p><br/><p>Traces of the Great War. A part of the battlefield that fell in a crack of the world as if testifying how fierce the battle was.</p><br/><p>Thanks to that, this place wasn\u2019t organized. It has stayed this way for close to 100 years.</p><br/><p>Amazingly enough, there were no corpses of the warriors of Valhalla nor the giants, monsters, etc. Because of that Tae Ho could retrieve the weapons while feeling more at ease.</p><br/><p>\u2018I just shouldn\u2019t take the white named weapons.\u2019</p><br/><p>There was also a capacity in Unnir. Even when excluding the white letters, that meant that it was a normal equipment, blue colored words were as numerous and at times you could even see golden letters that were more superior.</p><br/><p>\u2018The brighter the color is, the better the equipment.\u2019</p><br/><p>There was a difference among rare equipment just like there was an up and down in the cold water. Tae Ho put on a smile and then placed the weapons on the floor inside of Unnir.</p><br/><p>\u201cA bow, a shield, and armor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho wasn\u2019t picky regardless of the type of equipment. Siri looked at what Tae Ho was doing with a dumbfounded and laughed hopelessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho, isn\u2019t it a bit too much to take the broken weapons?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was an obvious question as she didn\u2019t know about the \u2018sword of the warrior\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. They all have their uses.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho shook his head with a merry expression and then took a broken bow.</p><br/><p>\u2018This belongs to Ullr\u2019s legion.\u2019</p><br/><p>Maybe it was because the eyes of the dragon had become stronger or starting from the rare ranked equipment, they all seemed to have their history that their respective legion was marked.</p><br/><p>\u2018The colors of each legion is showing.\u2019</p><br/><p>In the case of Odin\u2019s legion, there were many common weapons like swords and axes, but blunt weapons like hammers appeared in the case of Thor\u2019s legion and you could see firing weapons in Ullr\u2019s legion.</p><br/><p>Shields for Heimdal\u2019s legion, handcuffs for Tir\u2019s legion and armor for Freyrs legion. Tae Ho took all those things and opened his eyes widely. It wasn\u2019t only because he saw chronicle ranked equipment, that was colored in gold, that was rarer than the rare rank.</p><br/><p>\u2018Wow, there was also the legion of Freyja.\u2019</p><br/><p>She was one of the few Gods Tae Ho knew about Norse mythology.</p><br/><p>The Goddess of love and beauty and the one that was compared to Aphrodite in the Greek mythology.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, there\u2019s also Idun\u2019s legion here.\u2019</p><br/><p>It would be weirder than a legion of a Goddess even Tae Ho knew about to not exist.</p><br/><p>[Freyja\u2019s legions artifact]</p><br/><p>[Belt of the wise man]</p><br/><p>[Anecdote: The warrior that wears this belt won\u2019t get exhausted even after fighting for 10 days and night.]</p><br/><p>It seemed like it was a magical equipment that increased your health and stamina.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s fun that the anecdote shows instead of the stats.\u2019</p><br/><p>But of course, you had to first equip the equipment to know of its abilities, but it felt good because it seemed like it was connected to the saga.</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Tae Ho was looking still at the Belt of the wise man, Siri approached and asked. Tae Ho equipped himself with the belt and answered after he confirmed it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was surprised that Freyja-nim had a legion. She really is the goddess of beauty, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri tilted her head at Tae Ho\u2019s question and then realized that he was from another world and started to explain in earnest.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true that Freyja is the Goddess of love and beauty, but at the same time, she\u2019s the Goddess of magic and war. Her position in Valhalla is also strong to the point that she has a huge army comparable to Odin\u2019s legion.</p><br/><p>It was something Tae Ho didn\u2019t know well, but Freyja was a precious existence for Valhalla. She was one of the three Gods that had created the rune growth system, that could be said the core of the warriors of Valhalla.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn addition, Freyja-nim has transcended the legions and is the one that administers the Valkyries. She\u2019s a really strong and beautiful Goddess.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reason the Valkyries could lead strong and valiant warriors to Valhalla was that they learned Freyja\u2019s magic.</p><br/><p>And actually, Freyja was also the Goddess of disputes. War was needed to secure warriors of good quality in Valhalla. Making the kings of Midgard of the mortal world fight endlessly was the task she had received from Odin.</p><br/><p>\u2018It really is the Norse mythology. So the Goddess of beauty also fights.\u2019</p><br/><p>He thought that she was really Valhalla like and on another hand thought of Idun.</p><br/><p>\u2018Could Idun-nim also be a fighter?\u2019</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t imagine that sight at all but he thought that it would be possible. Because Heda and Rasgrid were both outstanding beauties and at the same time strong warriors.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho imagined Idun holding a sword and a shield and then checked Siri up and down.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou also took quite a lot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t leave the equipment of the Great warriors alone like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri dodged his eyes as if she was embarrassed and answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou thought well. When you loot an item, it\u2019s important to do it with a relaxed heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was important to just see the item as it was without looking at who used this item or if you had any conscience.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst of all, Tae Ho, are you really planning on going like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri also checked on Tae Ho up and down and said with warm eyes. That was because Tae Ho\u2019s current fashion was really serious.</p><br/><p>There was no way there would be something like harmony when he was wearing equipment from several legions that each had their own colors. It wasn\u2019t only flashy, it may be good to say that he looked like a clown.</p><br/><p>However, Tae Ho was with his head high.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have to save space in the pocket. And also, the utility is more important than the looks. You shouldn\u2019t also act like that and start wearing other things. Only then will we be able to return safely and you will be able to go to Anaheim with Rolph.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri couldn\u2019t refute back as those were right words and then she started to equip the items she had in her hand rather slowly.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho looked that Siri was becoming a mess in real time and then turned his eyes to his surroundings again. It seemed like looting earnestly had paid its fruits that he couldn\u2019t see almost any blue letters.</p><br/><p>\u2018Are unique and epic ranked items really that rare?\u2019</p><br/><p>It was an obvious thing, but he also felt a bit disappointed. But it was then.</p><br/><p>Brr.</p><br/><p>The Unknown sword piece started to vibrate. It was vague but it seemed like it was pointing in a direction.</p><br/><p>As Tae Ho approached that direction, the vibration became stronger and as a test, he went to a different direction and the vibration became weaker.</p><br/><p>A smile appeared on Tae Ho\u2019s face. He moved following the strength of the vibration and then discovered rainbow colored letters shining brightly.</p><br/><p>[Fragment of an unknown equipment]</p><br/><p>It was a cylinder shaped item, that had its top and bottom sliced off. Following each person, they could say that it was a hilt or the handle of a shield. It was that hard to be certain of its identity.</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho? Do you have something?\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri, that had become as much of a clown as Tae Ho, approached him hurriedly. Tae Ho extended the fragment of the equipment.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Unknown sword piece is reacting\u2026but it doesn\u2019t seem to be a part of this sword.\u201d</p><br/><p>If it were, it wouldn\u2019t have been the hilt, but a blade.</p><br/><p>Siri just looked at the fragment and opened her eyes sharply.</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps it may have the same origin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOrigin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, origin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri raised her head again and explained after smacking her lips a few times.</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho, I don\u2019t know if you have heard of this but among Asgard and the nine planets, one of them has already been destroyed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I heard that from Heda.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because the planet that was at the forefront got destroyed Asgard, Olympus and the temple became the front lines.</p><br/><p>Siri nodded once and continued speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe survivors of the destroyed planet fought along with us, warriors of Valhalla, in the Great War. Perhaps, those pieces may be from the destroyed planet and not from Asgard.\u201d</p><br/><p>A weapon of another planet, not Asgard.</p><br/><p>That was an understandable story. Because Heda and Ragna and even Idun weren\u2019t certain of the origins of the Unknown sword piece. It made sense if it really was from another world.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut of course, these are just probabilities. Perhaps, they may be an equipment that was used in the same legion. Or the owner of the piece of sword told you that the fragment was important.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a thorough attitude that was so like Siri.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s take it for now.\u2019</p><br/><p>There would be no change on the part that he would take it. Tae Ho put in fragments of equipment in the full Unnir and then raised his head and opened his eyes sharply.</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like the time limit has come. The flow of the magic power is becoming rougher.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although this was a world where earth and sky were mixed, and day and night was also mixed but Tae Ho could know instinctively. The night was approaching on the trace of the Great War. Just like he had told Siri, the flow was becoming rougher so they didn\u2019t have the leisure to spend more time.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hurry.\u201d</p><br/><p>They had already taken the equipment they needed. Tae Ho and Siri ran quickly following the flow of the magic power.</p><br/><p>After they climbed the hill they regained their consciousness at, they saw a valley that was carved widely, and magic power was being concentrated at one point of the valley.</p><br/><p>And a heavy and cold metal was in the middle of that flow. When you saw it from far away, it seemed like a sword at first glance.</p><br/><p>[Fragment of Garmr\u2019s soul]</p><br/><p>White gold colored words that indicated it was a unique item.</p><br/><p>There was a corpse of a huge beast near its surrounding.</p><br/><p>\u201cFragment of Garmr\u2019s soul.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Tae Ho started to read it loudly, Siri flinched. Although you could find the name Garmr in several places, it was because there was the corpse of a huge beast in their surrounding.</p><br/><p>\u201cHell keeper Garmr?\u201d</p><br/><p>The watchdog that guarded Gnipahellir, the entrance of Niflheim.</p><br/><p>It was when Tae Ho turned to look at Siri as if asking what that was.</p><br/><p>The world changed. Tae Ho and even Siri could feel it. Night came at the trace of the Great War. The flow of magic power that was gathered on top of Garmr\u2019s fragment started to swirl.</p><br/><p>A chill surged up from the ground. The blue wind that came from who knows where became one with the vortex, and the smoke gathered on top of Garmr\u2019s fragment started to take shape.</p><br/><p>It was a big and bad looking black dog that was so big it could gulp down a person with one bite. Its chest that was dyed in red because of the blood was memorable.</p><br/><p>Garmr, that had a transparent shape, looked at the sky and roared. And then, smoke surged up from several places and just like what happened with Garmr they started to take shape.</p><br/><p>The trace of the Great War that became separated from the world.</p><br/><p>Because of that, the deceased ones couldn\u2019t return to the place they had to. Even though close to a hundred years had passed, they were still stuck in this land.</p><br/><p>As if it detected the body temperature of live people, Garmr turned to look at Siri and Tae Ho. And it was the same for the several creatures that were recreated in the ground. They exchanged gazes for a really short while and it started without any kind of signal. The monsters started to charge towards Tae Ho and Siri.</p><br/><p>There were a lot of them. It would be good to call them as a red wave. Siri groaned and took out her weapon, and Tae Ho pulled that Siri towards his side. He grabbed Siri, that was flustered and had lost her balance, and then looked to some place and whispered lowly.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Asgard and the nine planets.\u201d</p><br/><p>The whisper that was mixed with exclamation calmed down Siri. And then she could know. She cheered while still being in Tae Ho\u2019s embrace.</p><br/><p>\u201cValhalla!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Asgard and the nine planets!\u201d</p><br/><p>A cheer that was like a storm was heard from behind them. A green wave that was formed with letters that were as big as the red wave surged like a hail and passed by Siri and Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>They also weren\u2019t able to return.</p><br/><p>And even though they couldn\u2019t return they hadn\u2019t changed.</p><br/><p>Warriors of Valhalla.</p><br/><p>The heroes of the Great War!</p><br/><p>They recognized their juniors Tae Ho and Siri. They laughed pleasantly and charged and then clashed against the monsters that were glaring at the two people.</p><br/><p>Siri, that had become excited and was blushing, took out her weapon as if wanting to fight with her seniors, but this time also Tae Ho held her back. Siri glared as if asking why now, and Tae Ho pointed at the hell keeper Garmr and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have to catch the boss.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fight between the warriors and the monsters was a dogfight. Then there was something this side had to do.</p><br/><p>Siri realized what Tae Ho\u2019s eyes were saying and then checked the equipment she was wearing and made a chant.</p><br/><p>\u201cDraco.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Saga: The one that can handle dragons]</p><br/><p>Tae Ho and Siri became one once more. The two of them that had passed over the battle charged towards the hell keeper Garmr.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 13 \u2013 Traces of the Great War (2) &gt; End</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It\u2019s a land that no one can approach because the poison coming out of its body is too strong even though it had already been hundreds of years since it got sealed. It\u2019s a place not even the Gods are interested in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hermes spoke with a non interested voice. It seemed like he had rejection on the swamp of Lerna that was filled with poison rather than complaints about Tae Ho that said that he would capture the Hydra.</p><br/><p>But he still had to go. Tae Ho found an optimistic point in Hermes\u2019 story like he always did.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo one will notice even if we fight loudly.\u201d</p><br/><p>And the fact that he had captured the Hydra.</p><br/><p>Hermes put a dumbfounded expression at Tae Ho\u2019s words but then cleared his throat and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, your way of thinking is clearly different. I think I understand why Athena likes you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Goddess of warfare and wisdom Athena really liked uncommon strategies and ideas.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways, I can draw a magic circle that send us over there as I have visited that place before. I will draw it before hand and entrust it to Athena as I have to go out tonight to find Demeter and Hephaestus. You can speak to her whenever you want if you are ready to leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m more thankful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hermes scratched his head and fixed his stance.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho had told him to speak comfortably like before but he was still the master of Asgard. He should at least show proper etiquette until they drove away the opponents completely.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Asgard and the nine realms.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Asgard and the nine realms.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Hermes saluted in the Asgard way first Tae Ho smiled and saluted back.</p><br/><p>Greeting in the way of Asgard even though they were in Olympus meant that he respected Tae Ho, the master of Asgard.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s much better. I will really leave now. See you later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hermes was a free person but still, it seemed like it was hard to show a narrow minded side of him to a master of a foreign world. He greeted Tae Ho with his eyes and then took a turn and left.</p><br/><p>\u2018The transportation means has been prepared.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho took a breath and sat on a boulder near him. The shelter of Hestia was inside a forest that no humans passed by so there wasn\u2019t any buildings excluding her shrine.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho raised his head and checked the location of the sun. The time for lunch had already passed so you could say that it was late in the afternoon.</p><br/><p>\u2018It will start tomorrow.\u2019</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t only talking about capturing the Hydra.</p><br/><p>He was also talking about the big picture he had drawn after that.</p><br/><p>There was quite a big difference between the current situation of Olympus and the Great War that took place in Asgard.</p><br/><p>The two of them were in war against the ones wanting to destroy the world but the conditions and the situation they were in was different.</p><br/><p>The Great War was a war in its simplest form. There was an enemy and allies, and you just had to conquest in strength.</p><br/><p>But the war in Olympus was different. It wasn\u2019t about the internal battles that occurred among the 12 Olympians.</p><br/><p>The existence of a leader was really important in the battle in Olympus.</p><br/><p>But of course, Asgard also had Gods or giant kings that were the leaders and played an important role. But their importance in Olympus was beyond that.</p><br/><p>Even if you killed a giant king, it was rare to see his army turn sides or give up.</p><br/><p>Actually, when Tae Ho defeated Tiachi and his troop, the remaining forces entered the army of the other giant kings.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t different for Asgard. When one God died, the warriors in their legion didn\u2019t side with the giants or leave Asgard</p><br/><p>But those things happened in Olympus.</p><br/><p>All of Sparta got liberated when he killed Ares. They weren\u2019t beings that wanted to destroy the world anymore and the ones that were the allies just before became enemies.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t because Sparta suddenly sided up with Athena. It was because the eastern army of the ones that wanted to destroy the world couldn\u2019t take in the army of Sparta physiologically.</p><br/><p>But of course, it wasn\u2019t a permanent effect. The Gods that had turned into beings that wanted to destroy the world just had to control the humans that lost their master as the God they served had died.</p><br/><p>But they needed plenty of time to do that. It was impossible to break the belief that already existed and plant another belief.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is more efficient.\u2019</p><br/><p>The humans of Olympus were basically beings that wanted to maintain the world. Because of that, he could increase the number of allies just by killing the Gods that had turned.</p><br/><p>In the other hand, the Gods that wanted to destroy the world couldn\u2019t increase the number of allies by killing the Gods that wanted to maintain the world. Even if they killed the God and liberated the humans, they would just remain as beings that wanted to maintain the world.</p><br/><p>\u2018There\u2019s no need to face the entire army.\u2019</p><br/><p>He could overturn the situation just by defeating the God ruling over the humans.</p><br/><p>But of course, this wasn\u2019t an easy task. The Gods of Olympus weren\u2019t fools either.</p><br/><p>The reason Ares stood up by himself was because of his absolute faith in himself of winning. And that was actually true. If he hadn\u2019t had Odin\u2019s preparations the one that won the battle would have been Ares.</p><br/><p>\u2018What we need is defeating them one by one. Making them expose their location.\u2019</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t have any probabilities to win in a frontal clash as the difference in their forces was too big. He had to gather the remaining strength in Olympus and at the same time aim for a guerilla tactic and defeat them one by one.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho debated about their opinions with Athena the past four days and the result of that was that they drew one big picture.</p><br/><p>Capturing the Hydra wasn\u2019t only adding one more dragon to their group. You could say that it was the starting point of what he drew with Athena.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho opened his eyes. It was because he heard the footsteps of Adenmaha.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, everyone has gathered.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you Adenmaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>He still had something to do before he went out to capture the Hydra.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho headed to the place the group was gathered at with Adenmaha.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>[Tae Ho\u2019s Valkyrie]</p><br/><p>[Odin\u2019s legion]</p><br/><p>[Rasgrid]</p><br/><p>[Tae Ho\u2019s Valkyrie]</p><br/><p>[Ullr\u2019s legion]</p><br/><p>[Gandur]</p><br/><p>[Tae Ho\u2019s Valkyrie]</p><br/><p>[Njord\u2019s legion]</p><br/><p>[Ingrid]</p><br/><p>The three people were the same like usual but the words floating above their heads was different. Cuchulainn spoke to him with a lukewarm voice as Tae Ho was looking at the green words with a satisfied face.</p><br/><p>\u2018Are you satisfied now? Do you feel good?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018hoho, what are you saying? This is all a strategic move to strengthen our force. I don\u2019t have any selfish motives. I feel regret that Reginleif and Kaldea didn\u2019t join. Hildegarde too.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018It seems like your selfish motives ended up showing up in the end.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho just smirked instead of answering and then looked at the Valkyries that were lining up.</p><br/><p>There was no need to move their legions compared to what he first thought. It was because Tae Ho wasn\u2019t a normal God but the master of Asgard.</p><br/><p>It was just like how the Valkyries followed the orders of the Valkyrie master Freya regardless of their legion.</p><br/><p>But it was then. When Gandur met eyes with Tae Ho she pretended to cry and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cSob, sob. Look at those eyes filled with evil thoughts. I knew that this day would come. You have to take responsibility for all of us, understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGandur, what kind of speech is that to the master?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gandur snickered as Ingrid rebuked her with a bewildered face and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fun.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gandur treated Tae Ho the same way since he was an inferior ranked warrior.</p><br/><p>The sincere Ingrid didn\u2019t know how to act at her actions but it was different for Rasgrid. It seemed like she had already given up or was ignoring her that she expressed etiquette with a calm face.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have finished the task your ordered us to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you Rasgrid.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rasgrid used polite speech even in informal places when he was the commander of Idun\u2019s legion. She finished expressing etiquette calmly and then took the still laughing Gandur and Ingrid that had a stiff expression to their determined location.</p><br/><p>The place inside the shrine of Hestia was filled with the aura of Asgard and not Olympus. It was thanks to the runes the Valkyries prepared with hard work.</p><br/><p>The runes filling up the floor were drawing a magic circle and Siri and Bracky were standing in it.</p><br/><p>Siri was putting a nervous expression but compared to her Bracky was as excited as when he got out to a battlefield and the both of them were wearing quite splendid clothes.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t armor but a formal dress.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho smiled brightly and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you ready to become Gods?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt feels weird but\u2026..i\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhenever you want.\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri and Bracky spoke almost at the same time. Thanks to that, the two of them turned to look at each other and then smirked. It seemed like their nervousness got eased because of the small happening.</p><br/><p>The superior ranked warrior of Ullr, Siri and the superior ranked warrior of Thor, Bracky.</p><br/><p>Siri still had a way to go to reach the top rank and Bracky was right in front of it.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, Bracky is a genius.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn reviewed. Actually, it wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to say that Bracky was a genius that would appear once in a thousand years.</p><br/><p>In the first place, Bracky being able to catch up to Tae Ho to some extent when he had the saga of the dragon knight Kalsted and great masters like Ragnar, Scathach and Cuchulain was already proof of his geniusness.</p><br/><p>With the same logic, Siri\u2019s talent was also outstanding although it wasn\u2019t like Bracky.</p><br/><p>She had gotten stronger by going to several battlefields with Tae Ho but if it was someone with no talent they would have already lost their lives.</p><br/><p>Now that Tae Ho climbed to the seat of master of Asgard he obtained the right to grant the two of them the seat of top ranked warriors.</p><br/><p>But Tae Ho wasn\u2019t planning to do that at all.</p><br/><p>It was because nothing good would come out it if he forced two people that still weren\u2019t prepared for it.</p><br/><p>Because of that Tae Ho took a step back like always thought.</p><br/><p>What changed when you became a top ranked warrior?</p><br/><p>Obtaining a divinity.</p><br/><p>Becoming a God.</p><br/><p>Then, did you really have to become a top ranked warrior to become a God?</p><br/><p>No. If you looked widely, the Valkyries and even the normal Aesir were all Gods.</p><br/><p>But just obtaining a divinity was meaningless. They needed Gods with a strong deity to strengthen their current force.</p><br/><p>It would be good to awaken their divinities by themselves like Tae Ho did but there was no rule that stated that they must do that. Just like how the previous Idun conceded her seat of the Goddess of life and youth to the current Idun.</p><br/><p>In that side, Siri and Bracky had special sides compared to the other superior ranked warriors. It was that the two of them had sagas related to divinities although it was limited.</p><br/><p>The saga \u2018son of a God\u2019 that transformed Bracky into a real son of Thor.</p><br/><p>The saga \u2018wolf Goddess\u2019 that made the blood of the God of hunt flow in Siri.</p><br/><p>Actually, the two of them had already confirmed the deity the would obtain in the future when they were superior ranked warriors.</p><br/><p>\u2018That\u2019s why this is possible.\u2019</p><br/><p>But this wasn\u2019t all. He could proceed with it because several other conditions had been met.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will confirm it once again. The two of you will become couple Gods. No objections, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bracky spoke with a blunt face and Siri answered while flushing.</p><br/><p>\u201cBracky will become the God of thunder and Siri the God of hunt.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a method to strengthen their divinities a little bit more. If they became couple Gods they would be able to support each other.</p><br/><p>\u2018So actually it\u2019s marriage.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn clicked his tongue and laughed. It seemed like the ones near them were thinking of the same thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cLastly, the two of you will become my lesser Gods.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was the same logic which he made them a couple. It was a supportive method that was possible thanks to Tae Ho being the master of Asgard.</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not bad being the lesser God of the master.\u201d</p><br/><p>They pleasantly nodded this time too.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, I will start the ceremony then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho raised his right hand and started to engrave the runes in the air. It was rune magic he got to learn naturally after becoming Odin\u2019s successor.</p><br/><p>The runes shone in the air and at the same time the dark blue divinity that surged up from Tae Ho started to cover the room.</p><br/><p>Siri and Bracky gulped dry saliva and closed their eyes and the several runes surrounding them started to shine. It looked like a sea of stars shining in the dark blue divinity.</p><br/><p>[Saga: Wolf Goddess]</p><br/><p>[Saga: Son of a God]</p><br/><p>Siri and Bracky activated their sagas and helped Tae Ho. It granted their temporal divinities a permanency.</p><br/><p>Siri\u2019s divinity was a silvery light.</p><br/><p>And Bracky\u2019s was a really dense blue.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho drew the last rune in the air.</p><br/><p>He released his authority as the master of Asgard and granted them new seats as Gods.</p><br/><p>The time this took wasn\u2019t short. Everyone had forgotten about the time but actually more than an hour had passed.</p><br/><p>Siri and Bracky were wet in their sweat and the same went for Tae Ho obviously.</p><br/><p>The ceremony ended. This was the moment new Gods were born.</p><br/><p>Siri and Bracky turned to look at themselves. Their divinities were still weak but would one day become powerful.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, this is really the last. The two of you kiss each other.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri was looking at herself with a deeply moved expression but then asked back as she got perplexed. Bracky was also opening his eyes roundly.</p><br/><p>But Tae Ho spoke with a calm face.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are couple Gods. It\u2019s the end of the ceremony so do it quickly. It\u2019s the order of the master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri hesitated at Tae Ho\u2019s request and turned to look at Bracky with a red face and Bracky laughed and embraced Siri\u2019s waist softly.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha, that was holding her breath, covered Nidhogg\u2019s eyes and Nidhogg struggled to watch.</p><br/><p>And finally the two people shared kisses. They were so big it looked like Bracky was about to eat Siri but they still suited each other well.</p><br/><p>While everyone was looking this in a satisfactory way Cuchulainn whistled and asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018But hey, did they really need to kiss?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Of course not.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018You are now cheating like breathing.\u2019</p><br/><p>How did he become the God of battles and conquer instead of the God of cheating?</p><br/><p>The ceremony came to an end while Cuchulainn sighed.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>The next morning, Tae Ho finished the preparations to capture Hydra and saw Siri denying the world and Bracky that was laughing while putting an awkward expression in front of the magic circle.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha put on a worried face in case something happened to them but Tae Ho realized that wasn\u2019t the case.</p><br/><p>\u2018I had my doubts but it really turned out like this.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho smiled bitterly and saw the tail that appeared in Siri\u2019s rear and her wolf ears that were drooping.</p><br/><p>Siri\u2019s saga enabled her to transform into a wolf Goddess like the name implied.</p><br/><p>Into a beautiful Goddess that had tails and ears of wolf.</p><br/><p>Bracky and everyone thought that Siri looked beautiful like that but it seemed that Siri herself didn\u2019t like it so she got angry whenever someone said something related to it.</p><br/><p>But now, the state of a Goddess adhered to her permanently.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hey, you knew this would turn out like this right?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I will stay quiet about it.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Evil bastard.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho just laughed and looked at Siri and Bracky with his \u2018eyes of the dragon\u2019. It was to check the green words about their heads.</p><br/><p>[Tae Ho\u2019s lesser God]</p><br/><p>[Wolf Goddess of hunt]</p><br/><p>[Siri]</p><br/><p>[Tae Ho\u2019s lesser God]</p><br/><p>[God of Thunder]</p><br/><p>[Bracky]</p><br/><p>It turned out well. Tae Ho checked that Athena was approaching and decided to proceed with what he was going to do this morning.</p><br/><p>\u2018What you were going to do originally? Is there something else left?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018The meeting.\u2019</p><br/><p>Siri had also become a Goddess. His battle prowess will increase considerably if he registered Siri in the \u2018warrior that had a Goddess meet him\u2019 thanks to her strong fighting capabilities.</p><br/><p>\u2018You won\u2019t get embarrassed like with Hestia-nim?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ey, she\u2019s captain Siri.\u2019</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to say that she had seen him since the \u2018warrior that had a Goddess meet him\u2019 had started.</p><br/><p>There was nothing to be embarrassed about.</p><br/><p>\u2018What do I say? You are always the same.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Thank you for the compliment.\u2019</p><br/><p>They stopped joking at this point. Tae Ho turned around and faced Athena and then the magic circle activated not long after.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 55 \u2013 The legion of the main God (4) &gt; End</p><br/>\n</div>"}

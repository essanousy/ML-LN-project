The lowest-ranked warriors couldn\u2019t endure the strength that was released when Harad descended.</p><br/><p>The Shinsoo of Thor\u2019s legion, the Tanngnjostr, disappeared with a mere wave of Harad\u2019s hands. Even now, Bracky still couldn\u2019t understand what Harad had done to make the Tanngnjostr vanish.</p><br/><p>And the same thing was about to happen.</p><br/><p>It was a different strength, but it had a similar smell to it.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet back!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bracky yelled reflexively. He activated \u2018Son of a God\u2019 and gathered thunder in his hammer.</p><br/><p>Back then, Ragnar had been with them. The legendary viking king had protected Bracky and the warriors.</p><br/><p>\u201cMove!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ingrid yelled. The inferior-ranked warriors, paralyzed by the crushing pressure which emanated from the sky, reacted to the Valkyrie\u2019s command. From where Ingrid stood, she threw her body behind Bracky\u2019s.</p><br/><p>An earthen disaster descended as the ground shook at that moment. A deep earthquake churned the ground and a torrent of soil surged up into the air.</p><br/><p>It was an incredible amount of dirt. It was the phenomenon created as Balgad, the Giant of Earth, descended to the ground.</p><br/><p>Bracky looked at the airborne earth which seemed fierce as a wave and fast as a storm and swung his hammer. Lightning crackled before him and made an opening.</p><br/><p><i>Kwagagang!</i></p><br/><p>The hail of dirt pummeled the ground. From a distance, the earth shook like mad as yellow lightning surged furiously amidst the growing dust cloud.</p><br/><p>Such was what Tae Ho saw. He, who was behind Bracky\u2019s group, moved towards Merlin as the wizard stabbed his staff into the ground. An invisible barrier coalesced in the shape of a wedge and cleanly split the wave of dirt around them.</p><br/><p>Siri huddled behind Bracky and covered her mouth and eyes. Although the lightning had torn through the hail, no one could do anything about the dust. Breathing was impossible, much less opening one\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Merlin clutched his staff and trembled. His magic power had been halved after Erin\u2019s destruction, and sweat began dropping like rain from his furrowed brow.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho\u2019s vision pierced outwards. He could see a red word beyond the dust that was smashing at Merlin\u2019s barrier.</p><br/><p>The Giant of Earth, Balgad.</p><br/><p>An existence comparable to even the Giant of Strength, Harad.</p><br/><p>As he walked, a thick armor of rocks formed over his body.</p><br/><p>What seemed like a mountain of rocks slowly closed in on them.</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>The gate connected with Erin had grown warped and distorted.</p><br/><p>The several things Balgad and Avalt had prepared had also become a mess.</p><br/><p>The reason the Giant of the Night, Avalt, stayed behind in Jotunheim was to hide Balgad\u2019s battlefield with his specialty magic, darkness.</p><br/><p>But now, the battlefield itself had been moved and Avalt couldn\u2019t see the effects of the darkness. Because of that, Avalt took his eyes off the battlefield and instead looked to a distant place.</p><br/><p>The Giants weren\u2019t the only race the Great Barrier was obstructing. Ironically enough, it also obstructed the Gods of Asgard.</p><br/><p>The giants at the front line sensed Balgad\u2019s sudden movement.</p><br/><p>Similarly, the warriors of Asgard squaring off against the giants also noticed that a disaster had occurred in some far away place.</p><br/><p>The giants didn\u2019t move, and the same went for the warriors of Asgard.</p><br/><p>It was an obvious thing.</p><br/><p>This place wasn\u2019t Asgard. The appearing of the Giant of Strength, Harad, in Asgard was a different case, but it wasn\u2019t such a matter for the giants at the front lines to intervene directly.</p><br/><p>The Gods of Asgard could know of the events inside the great barrier immediately.</p><br/><p>Still, while they knew the Giant of Earth, Balgad, had released his strength, they couldn\u2019t know who his opponent was.</p><br/><p>But that was enough. There was enough time.</p><br/><p>The Giant of the Night, Avalt, looked towards the Balgad and Idun\u2019s warrior once again.</p><br/><p>But it was only for a moment. He could only return his gaze to the front lines.</p><br/><p>There was a change at the front lines. The forces of Asgard had started to move.</p><br/><p>\u2018How?\u2019</p><br/><p>Like many instances, Avalt\u2019s confusion was an obvious thing.</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t have imagined that there was a Goddess not only observing her warrior but was even conscious of his condition.</p><br/><p>The moment Tae Ho left the vicinity of the Great Barrier, Idun could feel it. She could even connect with Tae Ho directly when he used \u2018Idun\u2019s warrior\u2019.</p><br/><p>Idun was instantly aware of the danger Tae Ho was facing at the front lines. She had ignored all procedures and requested for assistance with all her strength.</p><br/><p>He plea reached out to the God stationed at the front lines.</p><br/><p>That God didn\u2019t hesitate for a moment. He surged up with a crescendo of thunder.</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>The problem was time.</p><br/><p>Time wasn\u2019t with either side.</p><br/><p>The moment Thor moved, the giants at the front lines reacted. As Thor and the warriors of Valhalla marched, the giants blocked their path.</p><br/><p>The Giant of Earth, Balgad, wasn\u2019t planning to face Idun\u2019s warrior alone. He had lined up his underlings in the arrival gate of Erin.</p><br/><p>Balgad had moved alone because the destination had been altered, but it wasn\u2019t that his underlings had returned to Jotunheim or stayed immobile. They moved swiftly to chase the back of their master.</p><br/><p>For some, time flowed quickly.</p><br/><p>For others, time had slowed to a crawl.</p><br/><p>Balgad, the Giant of Earth, was like a living mountain. He was the most massive Giant among the Five Fingers.</p><br/><p>Distance shortened drastically with each of his steps. As the cloud of dust faded away, what Bracky and Siri saw was a towering wall of rocks that charged forward at incredible speed.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t something that could be countered like the hail of dirt.</p><br/><p>Bracky steeled himself. He took a deep breath and gathered all of his strength in his right arm to try and slow it down as much as possible.</p><br/><p>Faced with a decision, Siri transformed into a wolf. She bit Ingrid who stood closest to her.</p><br/><p>Siri charged forward. Ingrid yelled and two inferior-ranked warriors hung onto Siri.</p><br/><p>Bracky charged forward and smashed the ground with the strength he\u2019d amassed; however, it wasn\u2019t to split the earth. The thunder that followed his strike hit the wall of rock that was charging towards thim.</p><br/><p>The Giant of Earth was unavoidably halted for a step. Bracky\u2019s full powered attack wasn\u2019t something easily disregarded.</p><br/><p>But even so, it wasn\u2019t that he could defeat him.</p><br/><p>Balgad, who\u2019d been slowed in his advance, stomped the ground and the lighting subsequently scattered. An invisible force plowed toward Bracky.</p><br/><p>Bracky set up a defensive layer with the God\u2019s power within him and endured the invisible force while being pushed back; however, the inferior-ranked warriors weren\u2019t so fortunate. Their bodies were pulverized and became lumps of flesh.</p><br/><p>Bracky gritted his teeth. Siri, who barely managed to avoid the attack, raised her head and looked at Balgad.</p><br/><p>Balgad ignored the two of them. He kicked the ground and charged towards Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>40 meters.</p><br/><p>The charging of a giant that tall gave a pressure that make it seem like the sky was crumbling.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho didn\u2019t freeze, for he could hear Idun\u2019s voice. She didn\u2019t inquire his situation and instead worked harder to transmit to him more of her strength.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho bellowed out Idun\u2019s name. He charged towards the Giant of Earth as an image of Ragnar appeared in his mind.</p><br/><p>He had to do the same as he\u2019d done. He had to protect his allies while facing the giant.</p><br/><p>\u201cChant!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho transformed into a hawk and shot off at blinding speed. Balgad didn\u2019t miss Tae Ho and tracked him with his eyes. He swung one arm and rattled Tae Ho\u2019s path with the overwhelming wind pressure that followed and fired rock-hewn arrows from his other arm.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho flipped his body mid-air. As he transformed back into a human, he created a shield with \u2018Warrior\u2019s Equipment\u2019 and covered his body. At the same time, he stretched out his left arm and called out.</p><br/><p>\u201cMcLaren!\u201d</p><br/><p>The rock serpent that had been summoned in Midgard appeared in the gray lands of Erin.</p><br/><p>As McLaren appeared, Tae Ho simultaneously gave a command and then threw aside the shield he\u2019d blocked the rock-hewn arrows with before charging into the air.</p><br/><p>McLaren circled the opposite direction from his master. Before the shield reached the ground, he\u2019d already opened his mouth widely and gulped down Siri, Ingrid, and the surviving warriors of Valhalla. With them secured, he tunneled into the ground.</p><br/><p>Balgad ignored the serpent. He gazed intently at Tae Ho and swung his arm. Contrary to his size, it was a fast and precise movement.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho gritted his teeth. He forcefully kept his eyes open and looked at the wall of rocks crushing the air before him. He then activated his rune magic in quick succession.</p><br/><p>\u201cGant!\u201d</p><br/><p>A magical gale of wind was fired from Tae Ho\u2019s arms. It wasn\u2019t to push away the wall of rock but rather to increase his own fleeing speed.</p><br/><p>Balgad\u2019s arm passed beneath Tae Ho\u2019s feet by a hair\u2019s width. Tae Ho contorted his body once again and kicked the air to surge up. He reached a higher vantage point and unveiled a second summoning rock.</p><br/><p>\u201cRolo!\u201d</p><br/><p>The gryphon fluttered its wings and picked up speed. Rolo cried valiantly instead of shrinking back before the giant.</p><br/><p>Clutching onto Rolo, Tae Ho activated his saga. Rolo\u2019s wings fluttered twice, and what were previously white feathers morphed to become the membranous red wings of a dragon.</p><br/><p>Shooting Star, the master of flames.</p><br/><p>It was different from when he\u2019d summoned him to execute a lance charge. The true dragon wasn\u2019t merely ten meters long. Now, while Rolo still wasn\u2019t as big as the original master of flames, he had grown to a length of around twenty meters.</p><br/><p>Rolo\u2019s second flap of his wings created a great wind. It wouldn\u2019t be improper to call it an eruption.</p><br/><p>Sadly, Balgad was a bit faster. He didn\u2019t falter at the red dragon which had appeared so suddenly before him and knew exactly what he had to do. He extended his hand towards the seething red dragon quickly and grabbed its wing with his huge hand.</p><br/><p>With a mighty pull, he ripped it off. The red dragon cried as blood-like flames poured from the wound and dispersed into the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cRolo!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho screamed out as Balgad swung his fist towards the falling red dragon. Rolo was slammed to the ground like a crumpled piece of paper.</p><br/><p>The ground shook and Balgad tossed aside the wing he was holding. He then aimed a kick at the body of the red dragon.</p><br/><p>Rolo tightened his muscles. He opened his mouth and fired flames towards Balgad.</p><br/><p>It was a disastrous attack that could even melt rocks, but Balgad simply reacted to it calmly. He blocked it using his arms as a shield and didn\u2019t pause his advance at all. He then swung his arm in a wide arc to disperse the flames and grabbed onto the neck of the dragon.</p><br/><p>To this, Tae Ho also reacted rather calmly and immediately removed Rolo\u2019s transformation. The moment Balgad grabbed the air, Tae Ho had sent back Rolo who\u2019d crashed down after having lost a wing.</p><br/><p>Balgad\u2019s eyes glinted at Tae Ho and the rock-hewn arrows were once again fired out of his armor like rain.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 30 \u2013 The knights of the round table (4) &gt; End</p><hr/><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/><p>Episode 30/Chapter 5: The knights of the round table (5)</p><br/><p>TL: Tsubak</p><br/><p>ED: Julsmul</p><hr/><br/><p>Thor was going.</p><br/><p>Thor would go.</p><br/><p>Odin just spat out those words. He couldn\u2019t say anything else.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha felt like she would go crazy at the anxiousness. McLaren hadn\u2019t returned, and Rolo had his chest crushed and lost a wing after a mere few seconds on the battlefield.</p><br/><p>He had said that this battle wasn\u2019t much. That it would be fine as they would only clean up the remaining fomoires.</p><br/><p>But that wasn\u2019t the case. Adenmaha read the memories of Rolo through the magic of the Tuatha De Danann and thus she could also sense the fear and despair Rolo had felt.</p><br/><p>He was scared. So scared that a cry came out unconsciously.</p><br/><p>She recalled that fateful day in Erin. The day that everyone near her had started to die.</p><br/><p>Bracky, who was big and foolish but still held reliable qualities.</p><br/><p>Siri, who seemed the toughest but was actually the most gentle.</p><br/><p>And her master-</p><br/><p>The stupid guy that only thought about Heda.</p><br/><p>She felt like they wouldn\u2019t be able to return. At least one, or perhaps all of them.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha hoped earnestly. She didn\u2019t pray for everyone to return safely. She only waited for Tae Ho to call her so that she would be able to do something on the battlefield.</p><br/><p>But no matter how earnest she was, Tae Ho didn\u2019t call, and Adenmaha couldn\u2019t help but cry again.</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>The ash-colored lands were dyed in blood.</p><br/><p>Bracky staggered to his feet. He fruitfully tried wiping the blood dripping from his head and tried to recall what had happened, but there were gaps in his fuzzy memory.</p><br/><p>Like the landscape, the sky was ashen.</p><br/><p>Bracky took a breath. He started to remember everything that had happened in a few minutes one by one.</p><br/><p>Balgad had stomped on the ground and McLaren, who\u2019d been hiding, was launched into the air.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho had desperately recalled McLaren, but Balgad was a second faster. Balgad had gripped both McLaren\u2019s head and tail and pulled, tearing him in two. As McLaren was closer to being a spirit rather than a living being, his demise wasn\u2019t certain, but he couldn\u2019t know the details. McLaren disappeared and the ones within him had appeared in his place.</p><br/><p>The inferior-ranked warriors of Valhalla had all died helplessly.</p><br/><p>Bracky closed his eyes. The blood on his forehead wasn\u2019t stopping, and he couldn\u2019t activate \u2018The Son of a God Returns\u2019 as he had already used it today.</p><br/><p>A fierce battle had occurred in a short time.</p><br/><p>Ingrid was collapsed on the ground and unmoving. She had stopped the attack just before she\u2019d lost consciousness. Bracky didn\u2019t check if Ingrid was alive or not. He just had to hope that she was. He spat out a mouthful of blood and breathed in pained breaths.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho and Siri were still fighting. Siri\u2019s movements became really fast after she\u2019d transformed into a wolf. Tae Ho mobilized several weapons on top of her as they fought together. It was like two people were fighting with one body.</p><br/><p>Still, their battle against Balgad was disadvantageous to the extreme.</p><br/><p>If they allowed even one attack to hit them, they wouldn\u2019t be able to fight again, but Balgad still continued unabated even after having received several attacks from both Tae Ho and Bracky.</p><br/><p>But they still had to fight. Bracky gulped dry saliva for the last time and then charged towards Balgad.</p><br/><p>\u201cMighty Thor!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bracky\u2019s roar passed in between Tae Ho and Balgad.</p><br/><p>Balgad had almost all of his rock armor destroyed and looked at Bracky.</p><br/><p>His appearance was that of a scaled-down Thor. Standing up time and time again after being hit and charging towards him was a terrible thing by now.</p><br/><p>Balgad swung his hand. He used the intangible force to make a wall and strode forward while glancing at Idun\u2019s warrior at the same time. The guy that was riding on the golden wolf was holding a pair of swords.</p><br/><p>Caliburn and Caladbolg.</p><br/><p>Caladbolg\u2019s thunder was powerful. Although it wasn\u2019t to the point where Tae Ho could destroy a mountain with one attack like when Fergus Mac Roich wielded it, it couldn\u2019t be looked down on at all. Every time an attack landed on Balgad, a part of his armor was vaporized.</p><br/><p>Balgad had to admit that the bastard was strong. So strong, in fact, that it was unbelievable for him to be someone that had just become a superior-ranked warrior.</p><br/><p>That was why he had to kill him. He had to end the fight no matter what.</p><br/><p>Balgad roared and swung his pillar-like arms. Deadly kinetic energy was released alongside countless rock-hewn arrows. An earthquake followed that made their footing a mess.</p><br/><p>It was an attack that came both from the sky and the ground.</p><br/><p>Siri had succeeded in closing the gap between Balgad to dodge it until now. It wasn\u2019t easy, obviously, as a single error could result in their deaths.</p><br/><p>Balgad thought that Siri would do the same, but he was wrong. Tae Ho lowered his posture while sticking atop Siri, and Siri turned around. Rather than charging towards the arrows she showed her tail and escaped.</p><br/><p>The sudden change in their pattern caught Balgad off guard. In that brief moment of reprieve, Siri was able to put some distance between them and Balgad, and Tae Ho silently praised Bracky for stopping Balgad. Tae Ho turned to look at his back on top of Siri.</p><br/><p>Then, above of the head of the mountainous Balgad and beyond the ash colored sky-</p><br/><p>Merlin\u2019s chant was completed. They hadn\u2019t fled from the battlefield because it was disadvantageous or because they were scared. It was because they believed in Merlin\u2019s magic.</p><br/><p>What they called for was the disaster of the sky.</p><br/><p>The Giant of the Night screamed in shock from within the darkness and Balgad then realized what manner of magic had sundered the atmosphere above him.</p><br/><p>A meteorite summoned from beyond the sky was tumbling down. It fell at an unmeasurable velocity.</p><br/><p>Even as he looked up, Balgad didn\u2019t waste any time. He kicked the ground and tried to dodge the meteorite.</p><br/><p>However, Merlin didn\u2019t allow that. In the first place, he had prepared two magics. Although his magic had been halved, he was still the Great Magician of Camelot.</p><br/><p>The shadows that pierced from the ground firmly rooted Balgad\u2019s feet. They were obstacles that would only buy a few seconds.</p><br/><p>But it was enough with just that. With an ear-deafening explosion, the falling meteorite directly smashed into Balgad, the Giant of Earth!</p><br/><p>The resounding shockwave seemed to atomize all nearby matter, and the flames that burst out gulped down Balgad\u2019s figure.</p><br/><p>Siri let out a sigh of relief and Tae Ho did the same.</p><br/><p>However, Merlin couldn\u2019t do that. He knew otherwise, as he was the one that had activated the magic.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy King!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Merlin called out, a dark figure sprinted through the fire.</p><br/><p>A ten-meter giant whose skin was of rock.</p><br/><p>It was the original body of the Giant of Earth, Balgad. The body that was forty meters tall had merely been his avatar.</p><br/><p>The meteorite destroyed the avatar, but it couldn\u2019t break Balgad himself. The moment of the collision, Balgad released the remnants of his armor. His injuries were only minor.</p><br/><p>Balgad rushed towards Tae Ho and Siri and swung his fist. Siri sprung off the ground reflexively, but she couldn\u2019t dodge the attack completely.</p><br/><p>It was because the moment she threw her body to dodge the fist, pillars of rock also surged up and attacked her.</p><br/><p>Subsequently, both Tae Ho and Siri skidded across the ground.</p><br/><p>Merlin feverishly recited a new chant as Bracky unleashed his energy reserves to roar and charged forward.</p><br/><p>Balgad didn\u2019t waste any time. He arched his spine and heaved a mighty hammerfist towards Tae Ho and Siri.</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>Thor couldn\u2019t reach them in time.</p><br/><p>The giants at the front lines obstructed his path.</p><br/><p>Idun had grown frantic and called out Tae Ho\u2019s name repeatedly.</p><br/><p>However, Tae Ho couldn\u2019t answer her.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha worked hard to save the life of McLaren who\u2019d been torn apart. She kept reciting chants through a tear-stained face.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho took a breath.</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t died. He felt like his body was broken, but he was still alive.</p><br/><p>With no regard for his own safety, Bracky had blocked Balgad\u2019s attack and even fired lightning to dissipate some of the impact.</p><br/><p>He had fallen along with Siri, who was also alive. He could feel her shallow breathing as if it would cease at any moment.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho checked his pocket. The pieces of golden apple had disappeared. It seemed like he had lost the pocket sometime during the fierce fighting.</p><br/><p>Bracky couldn\u2019t endure for long. He collapsed after receiving an additional attack from Balgad. He was thrown far away and lay twitching on the ground.</p><br/><p>Balgad looked at Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho returned his stare, but he also glanced at the area beyond him.</p><br/><p>He could see the red words approaching. It seemed like they were the underlings of Balgad.</p><br/><p>He still had a summoning rock left, but he didn\u2019t call Adenmaha. He just squeezed out his concentration and activated a saga rather than calling her into danger needlessly. Five Valkyries doppelgangers, Heda included, were summoned next to Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>They charged towards Balgad; however, they were just able to buy a few seconds. They were mercilessly destroyed.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho took a breath and swung Caliburn which still stuck to his hand.</p><br/><p>To resist until the end.</p><br/><p>To fight.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun, Heda.\u201d</p><br/><p>His practice had taken fruits. Tae Ho called out Idun\u2019s name first and then smiled. He faced Balgad, who was bellowing and closing in fast, and then produced the glory of Camelot.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn assisted with a bit of his strength, and Idun cried out and strengthened her divine power even further.</p><br/><p>After that, shapes of people started to coalesce next to Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>Erin was destroyed.</p><br/><p>The fire of Surtr had burnt down everything.</p><br/><p>The sky and the ground were dyed in ash.</p><br/><p>But even that being the case, there was something that hadn\u2019t changed.</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>A sentence of light appeared atop Tae Ho\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>Erin\u2019s successor.</p><br/><p>The one who would receive everything from Erin.</p><br/><p>Merlin, who had been reciting a chant, stopped moving his mouth unconsciously. The ones that had gathered next to Tae Ho had that effect on him.</p><br/><p>The Knights of the Round Table.</p><br/><p>Their souls that had been scattered, now returned.</p><br/><p>Camelot was but a memory and Erin was destroyed; however, they didn\u2019t forget their pledge towards their king. Even if this land was dyed in ash, it was still Erin. It was the land in which the heroes of Camelot had given their ultimate sacrifice.</p><br/><p>The glory of Camelot gave strength to the the Knights of the Round Table. Although dim, the shadows, who had gathered next to the Sword of Selection, Caliburn, regained the appearances of their previous lives.</p><br/><p>They were in an incomplete state. It wasn\u2019t yet time for Tae Ho to fully achieve the power held by the King of Camelot. If this land wasn\u2019t Erin, they wouldn\u2019t even have been able to appear.</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, now wasn\u2019t the time to wait for the king to come into his own.</p><br/><p>The Knights of the Round Table expressed etiquette towards Tae Ho. Tae Ho didn\u2019t know them well, but Caliburn remembered them all. It was living proof of their legends.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur King calls for aid\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the knights spoke in reverence. His expression filled with veneration towards Tae Ho, he stepped forward and then flew at Balgad.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor the King of Camelot!\u201d</p><br/><p>The rest of the knights followed suit. The first knight to reach the giant was pressed down by Balgad\u2019s power and obliterated. Such was their limit as as incomplete souls.</p><br/><p>Nonetheless, the remaining Knights of the Round Table didn\u2019t waver. As one, they overtook Balgad\u2019s position like moths drawn to a flame.</p><br/><p>\u2018Remember our names.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Remember our stories.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was a complete massacre. With only their remnant souls, they couldn\u2019t win.</p><br/><p>But they didn\u2019t fear. They were rather happy that they could fight for Erin once more.</p><br/><p>Caliburn taught to Tae Ho as much through the sentence of the Milesians.</p><br/><p>The name of each one of them.</p><br/><p>What they were going to do now.</p><br/><p>Because of that, Tae Ho couldn\u2019t hold them back.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Asgard and the Nine Realms.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho uttered these words. He expressed his etiquette as a warrior of Valhalla.</p><br/><p>The remaining Knights of the Round Table smiled gallantly. One who had remained beside Tae Ho until the end hit his chest as if imitating him.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Asgard and the Nine Realms.\u201d</p><br/><p>The knight charged. Seeing this, the Giant of Earth, Balgad, who\u2019d known these knights well in battle, felt that their weakened souls were really quite pathetic.</p><br/><p>The Knights of the Round Table were vanquished one by one.

The strongest weapon of them all pierced the wall. No, it didn\u2019t only penetrate Balgad\u2019s shoulder but destroyed it.</p><br/><p>The strongest Knight in the Round Table.</p><br/><p>Lancelot\u2019s sword, Arondight.</p><br/><p>Balgad let out a pained groan and at that moment, the underlings of Balgad arrived.

He swung Caladbolg and fired lightning.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t towards Balgad or his underlings. Tae Ho stabbed Caladbolg towards the sky and the lightning split the clouds.</p><br/><p>Balgad couldn\u2019t understand Tae Ho\u2019s actions, and his underlings felt similarly.

He didn\u2019t just watch like with Harad.</p><br/><p>The distance between Jotunheim, the land of the giants, and the ruins of Erin wasn\u2019t short. It wasn\u2019t a distance one could traverse in an instant.</p><br/><p>Besides, Avalt had his own agenda. While the underlings of the frost giant king, Harmarti, kept retreating and advancing against the forces of Asgard at the front lines, the Magician King, Utgard Loki, protected Jotunheim along with the Five Fingers. Stabilizing and facing Asgard in several battlefields was their task.</p><br/><p>But they still had to move. There were still things they could do compared to that time with Harad.</p><br/><p>Avalt emerged from the darkness and cast magic in rapid succession to contact the giants at the front lines.</p><br/><p>Stopping Thor and the other rescuers was their task, but now they had to change the temperament of their actions.</p><br/><p>Balgad needed assistance. They needed to protect him from Idun\u2019s warrior, and if that wasn\u2019t possible, they had to at least eliminate Idun\u2019s warrior completely.</p><br/><p>Avalt left the castle of Jotunheim and felt anxious.</p><br/><p>The flow of time was unabated.</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>A century passed since Erin\u2019s ruin.</p><br/><p>The dark, dense clouds blocked the sunlight. Everything was dyed in ash and nothing good remained.</p><br/><p>One couldn\u2019t find any trace of Camelot.</p><br/><p>Erin, once known as a paradise, had completely disappeared.</p><br/><p>However, it shone at this moment regardless of its century in shambles. The bright light of the sun fell down on the land dyed in ash.</p><br/><p>The giant leading the charge lost his eyesight. Ironically, the strongest, brightest light he\u2019d ever seen since being born had burned out his eyes and plunged him into darkness.</p><br/><p>The giant couldn\u2019t see. The moment the sword of the sun cut his neck, a vision of light flooded his mind before his soul perished.</p><br/><p>\u201cScatter!\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the giants yelled out, but it was pointless. The neck of the first giant rolled on the ground. Tae Ho, who\u2019d stepped into the air, kicked back the shoulder of the collapsing giant and jumped up again.</p><br/><p>The blade of Gallatin was shining, but that wasn\u2019t all. Slowly, a new blade of light began forming on top of it. The new sword of light was longer than Tae Ho was tall, and it seemed like it was moving on its own.</p><br/><p>The sun shone upon Tae Ho. It gave him strength endlessly.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Balgad had lost an arm to Lancelot\u2019s Arondight and couldn\u2019t believe the scene in front of his eyes.</p><br/><p>Idun\u2019s warrior was certainly dying.</p><br/><p>He was barely enduring by channeling the strength of the Goddess of Youth and Life.</p><br/><p>That being the case, what exactly was this scene in front of him?</p><br/><p>Thunder and gale protected the warrior of Idun, and the sword he swung once again cut off the head of another giant.</p><br/><p>The giants didn\u2019t just die. They couldn\u2019t hit Tae Ho directly, but they attacked him by hexing curses on him. They depleted his strength and life by all kinds of negation magic.</p><br/><p>There was another small giant like Sigil. Compared to the other giants that couldn\u2019t do anything against the small and nimble warrior of Idun, this giant could face him head on. They exchanged blows a few times and then he suppressed Idun\u2019s warrior with his overwhelming strength of a giant.</p><br/><p>This exchange didn\u2019t occur without injury to either side.</p><br/><p>Be it a large or insignificant difference, their efforts would deplete the strength and energy of each other.</p><br/><p>Gallatin slashed the chest of the little giant. The giant spat out his last curse and collapsed. As he fell, the curse formed a blade of grudges and pierced Idun\u2019s warrior.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why he had to force himself to fight. As he himself was spending his strength, Idun\u2019s warrior was also growing weaker.</p><br/><p>Or so he thought. Even though Tae Ho\u2019s body was a bloody mess and not unlikely to collapse at any moment, he didn\u2019t falter. Rather, Gallatin began emitting an even stronger light. The more they fought, the stronger Idun\u2019s warrior seemed to become.</p><br/><p>\u2018How?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Why!\u2019</p><br/><p>The twelve underlings became eight in an instant and the Giant of Earth, Balgad, knew well enough.</p><br/><p>He remembered the day of Erin\u2019s destruction when he\u2019d fought against the Knights of the Round Table.</p><br/><p>This was the Knight of the Sun, Gawain.</p><br/><p>He\u2019d grow stronger as the sun rose higher, and when the sun was at its peak, he would be even more powerful than the strongest knight, Lancelot.</p><br/><p>Balgad looked upwards unconsciously. He looked at the light of the sun that was splitting the sky and pouring down.</p><br/><p>Time, it seemed, had abandoned the side of the giants.</p><br/><p>As they fought, the sun rose higher with each passing second.</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>Idun clenched her chest. Her once immaculate form was now sweating rivets and she gasped for air while lying half collapsed on the floor.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho was becoming stronger, but that strength was a double-edged sword. It wasn\u2019t a strength that Tae Ho\u2019s broken body could endure.</p><br/><p>Idun had made it possible.</p><br/><p>She squeezed out all her imperfect and immature power and sent it to Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>The strong power of the sun destroyed Tae Ho\u2019s body, but the gentle power of life kept it together.</p><br/><p>\u2018My warrior, Tae Ho.\u2019</p><br/><p>Idun didn\u2019t turn to look at herself.</p><br/><p>She reinforced the flood of energy into Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>The number of giants was further reduced to only six. Tae Ho\u2019s breaths were haggard as he looked out in front of him. The body of the giant he had just defeated collapsed on the ground with a heavy rumble.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho recalled Harad, the Giant of Strength. He was the first catastrophe he had faced upon entering Valhalla.</p><br/><p>The Giant of Earth, Balgad, was someone comparable to Harad.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t merely a strong existence.</p><br/><p>Balgad regained his composure and became decisively calm in the high-strung situation.</p><br/><p>He layered his own strength as his subordinates perished. He had lost an arm thanks to Lancelot\u2019s sword, Arondight, and had suffered a lot of damage because of the other knights\u2019 weapons, but he still had remaining strength. Tae Ho\u2019s strength was becoming stronger the higher the sun rose, but Balgad was currently still stronger than him.</p><br/><p>The number of giants had now declined to four. Gallatin\u2019s light shone vibrantly as Balgad finally threw his hulking form towards Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>At the forefront, his underlings didn\u2019t stand by idly. They fell back to clear space for Balgad and Tae Ho and slowly circled them in anticipation.</p><br/><p>The battle between a giant and a human couldn\u2019t be compared to a fight between beings of the same size.</p><br/><p>Where Harad increased his acuity and dexterity to enhance his battle prowess against comparatively tiny humans, Balgad increased an invisible strength.</p><br/><p>The giants went all out. The Giant of Earth swung his fist and a fierce storm whipped up with the intention of shredding Tae Ho. As Tae Ho manipulated himself through the air, Balgad\u2019s cronies conjured waves of lightning, fire, wind and light. Taking advantage of their cooperation, Balgad closed in on Tae Ho once more. The profound magic that had accumulated in Balgad\u2019s eyes was unleashed and enveloped Tae Ho\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>The devouring magic encircled Tae Ho as if a huge snake were trying to gulp him down. Within a split second, Balgad\u2019s malicious attack had succeeded in completely locking down Tae Ho\u2019s movements.</p><br/><p>Balgad was now confident of winning. He anticipated savoring the impending sweetness of victory after countless sacrifices.</p><br/><p>But it didn\u2019t happen that way.</p><br/><p>Even through his calculated demeanor, Balgad had forgotten something very important.</p><br/><p>The warrior of Idun wasn\u2019t alone.</p><br/><p>The Knight of the Sun wasn\u2019t his only title.</p><br/><p>He was King of Camelot.</p><br/><p>The King\u2019s influence was everything!</p><br/><p>Balgad screamed in pain as the several weapons still stuck in his body moved once again.</p><br/><p>The souls of the Knights of the Round Table had disappeared after expending the last vestiges of their strength, but their wills remained in this place.</p><br/><p>The power in the sentence of the Milesians moved their weapons.</p><br/><p>The spear of Perceval pierced further into Balgad\u2019s arm and stopped the lightning being fired towards Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>The sword of Bedevere carved through the back of Balgad. The magic sword of Agravain doused his flames, and the sword of Lancelot severed Balgad\u2019s magic power.</p><br/><p>The sword of Galahad shielded Tae Ho\u2019s back, and the arrows fired from the bow of Tristan pierced the eyes and necks of the encircling giants.</p><br/><p>The weapons of the Knights of the Round Table then gathered next to Tae Ho. They protected their King in the stead of their owners.</p><br/><p>From his position, Merlin pushed out more of his magic power. He coated the weapons in his spells to aid in their movement.</p><br/><p>He could sense the battle\u2019s conclusion was nigh. He knew he\u2019d probably never again see the Knights of the Round Table gather next to the King, but it was enough with this.</p><br/><p>Merlin didn\u2019t wipe away the tear which slowly passed down his wrinkled face. He thanked the miracle made possible through the knights\u2019 efforts, and he\u2019d, in part, connected his magic with their weapons to be with them once more.</p><br/><p>The underlings of Balgad had all collapsed. and the injured Balgad roared like a beast.</p><br/><p>While Tae Ho couldn\u2019t hear the voices of the Knights of the Round Table, he could imagine their figures holding the weapons aiming for Balgad\u2019s throat.</p><br/><p>Galatin had told him as much.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho was a warrior of Valhalla before becoming King of Camelot, and he knew-</p><br/><p>Saga.</p><br/><p>Each saga retells the unforgettable story of a great hero.</p><br/><p>Now that Tae Ho had remembered their names, they wouldn\u2019t be forgotten. They would live eternal lives through their stories.</p><br/><p>The weapons flew forward.</p><br/><p>It was the final assault of the Knights of the Round Table, one which decorated their legend.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho also blurred into motion. He didn\u2019t fall behind the weapons in speed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun. Heda.\u201d</p><br/><p>He muttered two names beneath his breath and added more of his own strength to Gallatin. He then activated a slew of sagas.</p><br/><p>[Saga: The Charge of a Warrior is like a Storm]</p><br/><p>[Saga: Giant Killer]</p><br/><p>[Saga: King of Camelot]</p><br/><p>The weapons of the Knights of the Round Table impaled themselves deeply within the body of Balgad. Arondight pierced the chest of Balgad, and the sword of Galahad broke his knee.</p><br/><p>Balgad went down on his functional leg and glared at Tae Ho with bloody malice. He reflected all his strength through his evil eyes.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho didn\u2019t hesitate. The sword of Gallatin surged high into the air before penetrating downwards, destroying the giant\u2019s magic power and splitting his body while rupturing his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun\u2019s\u2026warrior\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Balgad spoke for the last time. He was also a great warrior just like Harad had been. He smiled faintly instead of glaring resentfully and then collapsed after vomiting blood.</p><br/><p>After a moment, Tae Ho descended to the ground and nearly fell over. He wanted to pass out, but it wasn\u2019t the time. He endured forcefully and steadied himself.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho faced the cloud of runes that swarmed out of Balgad\u2019s body and closed his eyes for a moment. He moved his exhausted body to stab Gallatin in the ground and then looked at the weapons embedded within Balgad\u2019s body that lay still.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho never really knew much of the Knights of the Round Table, but he remembered their names. He would know their stories through the weapons they\u2019d left behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Asgard and the Nine Realms.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho hit his chest and expressed etiquette.</p><br/><p>He engraved the legend he\u2019d witnessed, the last battle of the Knights of the Round Table, deep in his heart.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 30 \u2013 The knights of the round table (6) &gt; End</p><br/>\n</div>"}

From behind him, the fire and the light were fierce, and there was a path of flames in front of him.</p><br/><p>The giant was big. Although it was smaller than the giant that appeared in Black Fortress, it still seemed to be tens of meters.</p><br/><p>The giant was covered entirely by flames in the middle of the broken pillar. There were deer horns in the helmet that covered its head and wore parts of the armor that covered its body.</p><br/><p>It only took some seconds for Tae Ho to close the distance with it. He could see and listen to several things in that short time.</p><br/><p>The dark fairies screamed. Monsters started to appear from the rocks that fell along the giant. The warriors of Ullr\u2019s and Odin\u2019s legions rode like crazy and the burning fire let out black smoke that seemed like it was screaming.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho grabbed his Heavy Lance tightly. It wasn\u2019t the time to picky about things. He had to attack and then see.</p><br/><p>Siri increased her speed. Tae Ho aimed for the left shoulder of the slow giant. He executed the merciless and powerful lance charging before it could even do something.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The Heavy Lance hit the shoulder of the giant. An explosion was heard and it stumbled back greatly.</p><br/><p>But that was all. Siri, that was covered in the aftershock, flew past the giant, and Tae Ho released the Heavy Lance that was partially destroyed and then turned back to look at the giant.</p><br/><p>He knew the moment he stabbed it. That he couldn\u2019t damage it. And the first lance he threw also couldn\u2019t damage the giant. It had just pushed it through the shock.</p><br/><p>Defensive aura.</p><br/><p>The moment they clashed its defenses broke. However, in that short moment, it weakened the power of the lance charging. And even if that wasn\u2019t the case, the giant was hard and even had armor in it. Counting that it had moved, it only had mere scratches in it.</p><br/><p>Siri made a big turn. And they could see along with Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>The giant raised its arms instead of grabbing a weapon like the giant of Black Fortress. At that moment the ground started to shake.</p><br/><p>A vortex of fire.</p><br/><p>The wind that was originated from the arms of the giant became one with fire. It started to charge like that and burned down the forest.</p><br/><p>\u2018My goodness!\u2019</p><br/><p>The giant wasn\u2019t a warrior. It was a magician. Although it was something that could happen anytime, Tae Ho could only get bewildered.</p><br/><p>The fire spreading in the forest became several times faster. Black smoke covered the sky and the dark fairies that were in the forest couldn\u2019t even scream properly. They collapsed after breathing in the smoke, and the warriors of Valhalla now also had to fight against the fire.</p><br/><p>A fire hole appeared again from the palm of the giant. The giant seemed to try to destroy everything at its surroundings instead of concentrating on Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>He had to stop it.</p><br/><p>He had to take its attention by whatever means.</p><br/><p>[Saga: The warrior\u2019s sword]</p><br/><p>Tae Ho made the Heavy Lance again. It flew near the giant and then threw the lance in consecution.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>The giant swung his hands as if shooing a fly. The ground shook greatly and the fire spread to the surroundings. Siri raised her speed with all her strength.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho passed over the wave of fire and thought. He didn\u2019t only throw the Heavy Lance just to take its attention.</p><br/><p>Understanding towards its defensive aura.</p><br/><p>The aura wasn\u2019t as hard as he thought. It just dissipated after blocking the attack of the Heavy Lance.</p><br/><p>But the problem was that it regenerated. Tae Ho grasped the timing it regenerated after three attacks. About 3 seconds. Although it was short, you couldn\u2019t completely take your time.</p><br/><p>[Saga: The eyes of a dragon sees through all things]</p><br/><p>Siri turned once more in the air. Tae Ho looked at the giant through the eyes of the dragon. He could see a faint light in the middle of its chest. Although he couldn\u2019t see the shape well as it was being covered by a triangular chest plate, he was certain that it had a weakness.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tae Ho!\u2019</p><br/><p>Siri called for Tae Ho with all her strength. And Tae Ho put more strength in the one that can handle dragons and supported Siri\u2019s flight. The wave of fire the giant was spreading became fiercer. Because of the dark smoke that covered the sky, Siri and Tae Ho found it hard to breathe.</p><br/><p>How would Rasgrid\u2019s side be fighting? When would reinforcements come? Will the fairies in the village be able to live? What about the warriors of Valhalla fighting below the Giant?!</p><br/><p>His felt was stuffed. He had to do something about the fire first. And to do that, he had to beat the giant first.</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho! The dark fairies!\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri yelled again with all her strength, but this time her voice was filled with delight. Tae Ho hurriedly turned to look where Siri was looking at. There were dark fairies gathering on the spot the branch ceiling disappeared. They were all green colored and weren\u2019t normal dark fairies.</p><br/><p>\u2018Magic!\u2019</p><br/><p>He could see that magic was being gathered through the eyes of the dragon. The magicians started to make a chant, and the concentrated magic power started to fly to the sky.</p><br/><p>A sound was heard above their heads. Clouds gathered, and Tae Ho could know what was happening.</p><br/><p>It was a downpour. Rain poured down on the giant and its surrounding as if a hole was made in the sky.</p><br/><p>The rain gulped down the smoke. It calmed down the fierce fire and it stopped the fire eating the forest. It even weakened the fire that was coming out of the body of the giant.</p><br/><p>\u201cOdin!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUllr!\u201d</p><br/><p>The warriors of Valhalla cheered. But they couldn\u2019t just be happy. Even though they were said to have bodies as strong as steel, compared to them the dark fairies were too weak. The heavy rain was as threatening to their lives as the fire.</p><br/><p>Rolph, that was looking at Siri and Tae Ho fight embraced a dark fairy kid that was collapsed near him. His breathing was weak and his trembling body was cold.</p><br/><p>They had to hurry. Although they would be able to win if they maintained this state and waited for reinforcements to come, countless dark fairies would die that way.</p><br/><p>The giant turned towards the dark fairy magicians. It started to chant to attack them, that was far away, and the dark fairies couldn\u2019t leave their spots even when knowing that. It seemed like it was to maintain the downpour.</p><br/><p>Other dark fairies were riding to this place with their horses. The giant threw a ball of wind towards the dark fairy magicians and some of them raised their staves at the exact timing. Something you couldn\u2019t see with your eyes barely fended off the ball of wind.</p><br/><p>Bababababang!</p><br/><p>The wind broke the trees. Unluckily enough, some magicians that were near the tree got torn up by it, and there were even some that vomited blood.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho breathed in. Siri staggered because of the pouring rain but she flapped her wings while gritting her teeth. Tae Ho whispered his tactic towards her.</p><br/><p>It was too reckless.</p><br/><p>However, Siri agreed instead of opposing. It seemed like they just had to be reckless to beat that giant.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho yelled. Siri added her own saga while flying. She activated the \u2018wolf witch\u2019 and conserved her strength and stamina a bit more.</p><br/><p>[Saga: The one that can handle dragons]</p><br/><p>[Saga: The charge of a warrior is like a storm]</p><br/><p>Tae Ho also used his sagas in consecution. It was to make Siri\u2019s reckless flight a success.</p><br/><p>Siri flew towards the head of the giant as if charging against it. The giant extended its hand but Siri barely passed over it and then turned in a spiral. Siri\u2019s back was headed to the ground for a moment, and at that moment Tae Ho flipped down Unnir. He poured down some things inside of it hurriedly.</p><br/><p>They were two stones that were the size of a finger. The moment they got out of Unnir, Tae Ho chanted just like he was taught by Heda. The rocks returned to its original size without having to wait for 3 seconds.</p><br/><p>Babang!</p><br/><p>The boulders the size of a person hit the head of the giant. Although the height it was dropped from was low and the giant was big, he couldn\u2019t damage it greatly but it was enough. The defensive aura broke and Tae Ho jumped down Siri\u2019s back. His objective was the chest of the giant.</p><br/><p>[Saga: The warrior\u2019s sword]</p><br/><p>He grabbed Runefang while falling. He made it emit orange flames even in the middle of the heavy rain and focused at one point. It was the part that was connecting the giant\u2019s chest plate.</p><br/><p>Crush!</p><br/><p>Runefang broke the connector. It left a small wound in the giant and Tae Ho ground his teeth. He barely kicked on the ground and also broke the lower connector.</p><br/><p>The Giant moved its hand to hit Tae Ho and he twisted his body in the air. He kicked in the air once again and yelled.</p><br/><p>\u201cChant!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho transformed into a hawk. He spread its wings widely and then flew up.</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho!\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri flew below Tae Ho. Tae Ho released his transformation after landing on Siri\u2019s back and then looked at the giant. Thanks to the connectors of one side being completely cut off, the chest of the giant was completely exposed.</p><br/><p>A huge rock that emitted a blue light was stuck in its chest. Tae Ho realized even without having to use the dragon\u2019s eyes. That was its weakness. And perhaps, it may be the origin of its strength.</p><br/><p>Siri raised her speed with all her strength. Tae Ho shot off Gant in consecution and scattered the whirlwinds.</p><br/><p>He dodged the whirlwinds. Siri and Tae Ho flew up almost vertically and cold rain poured down the two people. Tae Ho breathed roughly. He stuck closely to Siri and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cCaptain Siri, endure it. I will overdo it quite a lot starting from now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri put on a forced smile. Instead of asking if what they did until now wasn\u2019t overdoing it she determined herself. She prepared for the last flight.</p><br/><p>\u2018One hit one kill.\u2019</p><br/><p>It wouldn\u2019t work if he stuck to its chest and broke it little by little. He needed one strong blow after he broke down its aura.</p><br/><p>So to say an attack you could put everything on!</p><br/><p>The golden aura that was being emanated from the Heavy Lance started to take shape. It started to form a whirlwind following the spear and at the tip of that, a brighter light of Idun was concentrated.</p><br/><p>The strength of a God.</p><br/><p>In addition to it, Tae Ho\u2019s and Siri\u2019s saga.</p><br/><p>[Saga: The charge of a warrior is like a storm]</p><br/><p>[Saga: The arrows of a witch never misses its target]</p><br/><p>The lance charging wasn\u2019t an arrow. But the attack he would execute now would be able to be applied to Siri\u2019s saga.</p><br/><p>The powerful blow Ragnar had spoken of.</p><br/><p>The strongest saga he could make right now.</p><br/><p>[Synchro rate: 17%]</p><br/><p>[Synchro rate: 18%]</p><br/><p>His synchronization rate increased just by recreating the saga. It was obvious. Because this technique was one that represented Kalsted\u2019s first years!</p><br/><p>[Sga: Roar of the dragon]</p><br/><p>Draconic Ballista!</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>It pierced through the earth. The explosion ringing through the skies was just like a roar of a dragon.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a simple charge. Another driving force was generated behind Tae Ho\u2019s back. The golden light that appeared from between the thick lines of light was already a thunder. It was a thunderbolt. Tae Ho and Siri became an arrow of death themselves.</p><br/><p>The giant hurriedly created some wind and then broke it. Thanks to that, their path was shaken a bit but Siri\u2019s saga supported that. They started to fly towards the chest of the giant in a rough life!</p><br/><p>The strength of the God pushed away from its defenses. The tip of the spear that was shining stabbed the rock, and then it exploded along with it. The piercing strength of Draconic Ballista pierced through the cracks of the rock.</p><br/><p>A blue light shone greatly. It seemed like the entire world was dying in blue.</p><br/><p>Maybe it was his feeling or it was actually like this that time felt to run slow. Tae Ho and Siri land to the ground immediately and swam through the crack of the rock really slowly.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t know what had happened but Tae Ho was certain.</p><br/><p>They had beaten the giant. They had defeated it.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho extended his hand towards the center of the blue rock he had broken. Several kinds of runes became smoke and started to gather on Siri and Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>And at that moment.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho blinked. Time started to flow normally again. However, Tae Ho and Siri didn\u2019t fall. A bigger blue light covered the two of them and the world turned upside down.</p><br/><p>\u201cUllr!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun\u2019s warrior!\u201d</p><br/><p>Rolph cheered while looking at the giant falling down. And the other warriors also did the same.</p><br/><p>However, Rolph got perplexed. He looked at his surroundings and dropped his mouth open with a pale face.</p><br/><p>\u201cCaptain Siri?! Tae Ho?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them were nowhere to be seen. He thought that they would fly again to the sky or land roughly, but it was neither.</p><br/><p>How so.</p><br/><p>Rolph looked at the sky with a stupefied face. He could only see dark clouds in the sky where they had disappeared.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>Tae Ho and Siri crashed on the ground. Tae Ho bounced down and then rolled on the ground and Siri returned to her human form. Maybe it was because she used the \u2018wolf witch\u2019 in the middle that her clothes that were inside the wing coat were a mess.</p><br/><p>But it wasn\u2019t the time to worry about those things. Siri was unconscious and couldn\u2019t wake up, and Tae Ho that had barely stayed conscious let out a groan and barely got up.</p><br/><p>\u201cCaptain\u2026\u2026.Siri?\u201d</p><br/><p>The runes they couldn\u2019t finish absorbing got sucked into their bodies after becoming red smoke.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho approached Siri and then lied her down. He used his laps as a pillow sloppily and then raised his head to look at his surroundings.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is\u2026\u2026.this?\u201d</p><br/><p>A world that had day and night, and earth and sky mixed.</p><br/><p>The scene that you could only express it that way was spread in front of Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 12 \u2013 Roar of the dragon (2) &gt; End</p><br/>\n</div>"}

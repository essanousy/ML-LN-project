I feel like I can do it better in other places.\u201d</p><br/><p>Echidna blessed Tae Ho\u2019s forehead and licked her lips as if it was a bit regretful. Adenmaha spoke up immediately at her bewitching look.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine. He doesn\u2019t need it in another place.\u201d</p><br/><p>Echidna giggled at Adenmaha opened her eyes sharply and grabbing Tae Ho\u2019s arm. But unexpected members butted in the conversation.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is the other place? Nidhogg also wants to bless you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSob sob, master. Please give me the opportunity to bless too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg asked with an innocent face and Drakon Ismenios let out an earnest voice with a really sorrowful face.</p><br/><p>Echidna opened her eyes sharply and asked Adenmaha.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, where is that other place? Where are you talking about? Huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY, you shameless!\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha yelled with a red face. She tried to cover Nidhogg\u2019s ears quickly but she was a bit faster.</p><br/><p>\u201cAdenmaha, where is that other place?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSob sob, I also want to give you a blessing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg tilted her head and Ismenios let out a sorrowful voice once again.</p><br/><p>As Adenmaha hesitated while she couldn\u2019t give out an answer, Echidna put on an innocent face imitating Nidhogg and then tilted her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe place I talked about is the cheek. Where did the lewd lady think of? This innocent Echidna can\u2019t even think of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she giggled in the end, Adenmaha\u2019s red face became even redder because of her anger.</p><br/><p>But Nidhogg, that didn\u2019t know of Adenmaha\u2019s complicated thoughts, shone her eyes and replied to Echidna.</p><br/><p>\u201cNidhogg also blessed master in the cheek. I also did it to Adenmaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSob sob, me too\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It was already chaos. There was indeed a conversation but it felt like they were in a world of their own.</p><br/><p>\u201cM, master! Please tell her something quickly!\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha pulled on Tae Ho\u2019s arm and pleaded. She was requesting him to scold her quickly but Tae Ho\u2019s reaction was out of her expectation. He was just looking at a distant place with an absent minded expression even though Adenmaha was pulling his arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho master?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg also spoke but Tae Ho still looked at a far place.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha pulled his arm more strongly because she got surprised and only then did Tae Ho regain his consciousness and turned to look at everyone.</p><br/><p>It seemed like he hadn\u2019t heard anything until now.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster? Are you okay? You aren\u2019t hurt anywhere?\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha asked with a worried face. Tae Ho also answered slowly this time and Echidna, that was observing them, clapped her hands and gathered the attention of everyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like it\u2019s that. Well, it should indeed be unfamiliar for a God of Asgard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you meant with that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Echidna shrugged her shoulders at Adenmaha\u2019s question and then answered her properly without teasing her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am the God of dragons and at the same time the mother of all monsters. I\u2019m the ruler of the city underground that I rule and at the same time the guardian God. But the master of Asgard took control of me. What do you think this means?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe sacred force?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone flinched at the answer that came out of Adenmaha\u2019s mouth and Echidna nodded after putting a surprised face.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuite intelligent. That\u2019s right. It means that my sacred force has been handed over to the master of Asgard entirely.\u201d</p><br/><p>The 12 Olympians weren\u2019t the only ones that possessed sacred forces. Even Hades, that wasn\u2019t one of the 12 Olympians, had a vast sacred force called the underworld.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still marvelous. Does the effects of the sacred force pass over to a foreign God without filters?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Gods of the other world also received received strength and divinity from the ones that served them but the Gods of Olympus could obtain a much bigger strength from the sacred force as the believers didn\u2019t only serve them but were under their control completely.</p><br/><p>In the first place, the only ones that could have sacred forces were the Gods of Olympus so Echidna hadn\u2019t thought deeply about another God obtaining a sacred force. The only thing she presumed was that the efficiency would be worse compared to the Gods of Olympus.</p><br/><p>But looking at the reaction of Tae Ho, it seemed like he had taken over the sacred force completely like another God of Olympus.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur master is great. But Echidna, mother of all monsters. Can you really call this much a sacred force?\u201d</p><br/><p>Drakon Ismenios praised Tae Ho first and then asked.</p><br/><p>It was because the current situation wasn\u2019t possible for Drakon Ismenios, that was a God of Olympus.</p><br/><p>Drakon Ismenios also had a territory of his own and had dozens of underlings.</p><br/><p>However, he didn\u2019t have a sacred force. It was because a sacred force wasn\u2019t made with only a dozen underlings.</p><br/><p>Each of Echidna\u2019s children certainly possessed great strength but they were merely a dozen and the cave under the ground was also a bit wide. It barely had the size of a big village.</p><br/><p>That meant that when Drakon Ismenios judged logically, it wasn\u2019t possible for Echidna to have a proper sacred force.</p><br/><p>Echidna didn\u2019t answer anything at Drakon Ismenios\u2019 remark. She just laughed and crossed her arms and glanced at Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not only this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho said. His eyes after activating \u2018the eyes of the dragon\u2019 were still looking at a distant place.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster? What does that mean\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Drakon Ismenios shut his mouth. It was because Tae Ho transmitted what he saw to him directly through the \u2018one that conquers dragons\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cAmazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Drakon Ismenios said and Echidna laughed in a good mood.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course it is. This is only the entrance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you saying there is another city below this?\u201d</p><br/><p>The quick witted Adenmaha grasped the situation immediately. It seemed like Echidna liked that Adenmaha that she stroke her cheeks and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cLewd lady, for how long do you think I have been living? Will I really be living only with my children? What about the children of my children? Or the children of their children? Or the ones that came from outside. They also need a place to live.\u201d</p><br/><p>Echidna finished speaking by laughing and then turned around.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt will be faster for you to see it directly. Follow me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha wiped her cheeks and looked at Tae Ho and Tae Ho nodded. He led everyone and followed Echidna.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>\u201cFor there to be a city of this size under the ground.\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri spoke with a bewildered voice and looked down at the scene in front of her. There really was a city below the ceiling that had shining rocks carved in it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow many of them are living in this place?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Bracky opened his eyes widely and asked, Echidna bit a cigarette and answered quickly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder, I didn\u2019t count them exactly but there should still be ten thousand. If I also count the small ones there should be more than that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy God. For there to be so many of them living under the ground\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Drakon Ismenios gulped saliva as he could have never dreamed this.</p><br/><p>A size of ten thousand was size if you compared them to a polis but the ones living in that city weren\u2019t humans but monsters. You could compare them as a polis where more than 100.000 people lived.</p><br/><p>The sacred force could only be made with a size this big. It meant that there were more than ten thousand monsters that served Echidna.</p><br/><p>Drakon Ismenios looked at Echidna once again and she answered the doubt in his eyes gladly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe influence of Typhon is strong in this place. The Gods of Olympus don\u2019t even know that I have a sacred force.\u201d</p><br/><p>Actually, Athena and even the messenger God Hermes had forgotten that there was a sacred force in this land.</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed, are you saying that you can deceive the eyes of the Gods of Olympus even if a sacred force is made in this place?\u201d</p><br/><p>Rasgrid, that was just listening silently, asked in a low voice. Her voice was calm like usual but it had a slight excitement behind it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe lady that looks like Athena is smart too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Echidna knew why Rasgrid had gotten excited. That\u2019s why she told her thoughts aloud to everyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor the Gods of Asgard, Olympus is a foreign land. But this place can become Asgard. I mean, the sacred force of the master of Asgard.\u201d</p><br/><p>In addition, it was a sacred force that was kept as a secret. The Gods of Olympus won\u2019t even know in their dreams that Tae Ho had established a sacred force.</p><br/><p>\u201cEchidna, won\u2019t it have a counter effect on you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho asked. It was because if Tae Ho\u2019s group were Gods of Asgard, then Echidna was a God of Olympus. He couldn\u2019t know how it would affect Echidna if he dyed this land with the power of Asgard.</p><br/><p>But Echidna shook her head compared to Tae Ho\u2019s worry. She grabbed herself with her arms and spoke with a fascinated voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my, what are you talking about after you conquered me that roughly? I\u2019m already dyed in your color just like that lewd lady over there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cP, please choose your words well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Echidna laughed once again as Adenmaha protested lightly. She then looked at Tae Ho\u2019s eyes and continued speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine no matter what color you dye it with. This city, this sacred force, still hasn\u2019t been completely dyed with your color.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho looked down at the city again. Ingrid spoke with an admiring voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cAsgard is going to be made in Olympus\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed, as expected of a God of conquer\u201d</p><br/><p>Gandur smirked like she liked the idea. Drakon Ismenios got excited and added.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the start. Let\u2019s start with this place and devour all of Olympus.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, is it a war of conquer? That\u2019s not bad either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like something is flowing strangely.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bracky laughed and Siri frowned slightly.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho listened to their words and thought. He raised his left hand before spreading the dark blue divinity of the God of conquer.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster?\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha noticed that something wasn\u2019t right and asked with a nervous expression. Tae Ho looked at her for a moment and then smiled towards her.</p><br/><p>\u201cAdenmaha, do you remember what I said before?\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha blinked. It was because they had spoken about a lot of things.</p><br/><p>But Adenmaha soon understood what he was talking about. She gulped dry saliva and then her eyes reddened.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho nodded. He stroke Adenmaha\u2019s cheek as she was about to cry at any moment and blessed her in the forehead.</p><br/><p>What Tae Ho had promised her.</p><br/><p>Not only to her but to the several people living in the residence of Idun.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho spread his hand. He brought up his drak blue divinity and raised his hand.</p><br/><p>Echidna got bewildered. Drakon Ismenios dropped his mouth and admired and Bracky and Siri turned to look at each other. They realized that their divinities wasn\u2019t only limited to Asgard.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn couldn\u2019t say anything. He just burst in an emotional laughter.</p><br/><p>Erin\u2019s sentence.</p><br/><p>It shone from Tae Ho\u2019s hand. The light that got emanated became one with the dark blue divinity and grasped the entire city.</p><br/><p>He conquered a part of Olympus completely.</p><br/><p>A land where the power of Asgard and Erin existed.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t only end there.</p><br/><p>He also created one more history that was possible as he was the successor of Erin.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho clenched his fist. He claimed as the real successor of Erin.</p><br/><p>In this moment the destroyed world will get rebuilt once again, it will obtain land and citizens and will start once again!</p><br/><p>White light flashed above the dark blue divinity.</p><br/><p>It showed its existence clearly through everything in its surroundings and not only the sentence of Erin.</p><br/><p>Erin.</p><br/><p>The shining land.</p><br/><p>The only world where the Tuatha De Danann and the Milesian existed together.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho looked at Adenmaha. She smiled brightly and cried and then embraced him tightly.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Rasgrid hit her chest with a fist. Ingrid and Gandur laughed and followed her.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Asgard and the nine realms.\u201d</p><br/><p>For the returned world.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho did the same.</p><br/><p>He congratulated the rebirth of Erin as its successor and the master of Asgard.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 57 \u2013 The mother of all monsters (3) &gt; End</p><hr/><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/>\n</div>"}

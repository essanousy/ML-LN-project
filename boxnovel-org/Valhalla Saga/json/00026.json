The gnolls that had seen the giant fall lost all their fighting spirits. They were more busy fleeing rather than fighting, and in the end, they all started fleeing desperately.</p><br/><p>The moment more casualties occurred on a battlefield wasn\u2019t when they clashed frontally. It was when one side chased down the fleeing side and massacred them one-sidedly.</p><br/><p>Valkyrie Rasgrid lowered her posture in the plains and looked at the ground. Her dragon wing coat that were made with white scales suited the plains well.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe won.\u201d</p><br/><p>Valkyrie Reginleif said this with a satisfied face. She, who was born with a really precious bloodline even among Valkyries, was always composed and beautiful.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will take a while just by cleaning up the corpses of the gnolls.\u201d</p><br/><p>She said that as a joke and then looked up the sky. It seemed like someone spread the rumors that a flock of crows was gathering.</p><br/><p>Rasgrid raised her head and looked at that. She couldn\u2019t see Hugin in between them. It seemed like he had already left for another battlefield.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe warriors were moved inside Black Fortress. Each commander has already started retrieving the casualties.\u201d</p><br/><p>Valkyrie Ingrid approached carefully and spoke towards Reginleif. Her role as a specialized messenger made her steps as light as a feather.</p><br/><p>Rasgrid let out a long sigh. She stood up slowly and then turned to look at Reginleif and Ingrid. She could see a headless giant and a greatly damaged fortress beyond the two of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cA giant has appeared.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was lowest ranked, but it was still a giant. In a normal situation, the Black Fortress would have collapsed and countless warriors of Valhalla would have died.</p><br/><p>Rasgrid\u2019s cold eyes sunk down. She thought of the things that happened yesterday and today.</p><br/><p>She understood that a Stragos had appeared in the dwarven mines because they were the giants\u2019 hunting dogs that could smell and search for the unts. It wouldn\u2019t be weird for them to appear at anytime.</p><br/><p>A giant however was different.</p><br/><p>How was it that they appeared? Why did they send a giant to the fortress?</p><br/><p>Either they aimed for it, or planned it, or it was a strategy.</p><br/><p>\u2018Perhaps there may be a simpler reason.\u2019</p><br/><p>Their attacks had gotten so strong to the point that they sent a giant to the rear. It seemed like Ragnarok had progressed that much.</p><br/><p>Rasgrid didn\u2019t say anything. However, Reginleif knew really well what she was thinking about.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have already reported this. Although my responsibilities don\u2019t end here, I have done all I can. So let\u2019s forget about the giant at least for today. Aren\u2019t there more important things than that?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Reginleif smirked, Rasgrid opened her mouth and asked even though she knew exactly what she was going to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat things?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRewarding the warriors. Being happy for the victory and share alcohol with them. My sister.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI also think like that. The warriors have performed better than we thought. I feel proud to be a Valkyrie that helps and leads them,\u201d Ingrid added. There was excitement in her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, let\u2019s return and drink some alcohol. You can\u2019t stay out today Rasgrid.\u201d</p><br/><p>Reginleif crossed her arm on Rasgrid\u2019s shoulder and laughed. Ingrid also laughed lowly and in the end, and Rasgrid also put on a smile.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>The sun set, and night came. The fire in the altar burned so intensely it seemed to devour the night.</p><br/><p>Valkyrie Reginleif stood in front of the high altar. The warriors of Valhalla that amounted more than 2,000 looked at her in a comfortable posture, and Reginleif swung her clenched fists.</p><br/><p>\u201cValiant warriors! Warriors of Valhalla!\u201d</p><br/><p>Reginleif\u2019s voice was so loud it resembled thunder, but it didn\u2019t hurt their ears. Rather, her voice was beautiful and magnanimous that made their ears enjoy it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI express my respect at your braveness and I praise you for that! Think of it as an honor that tonight I, Valkyrie Reginleif, will be together with you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUaaaaaaa!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cValkyrie!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReginleif!\u201d</p><br/><p>The warriors answered with a heated cheer. It was a heat that didn\u2019t seem to lose to the fire in the altar.</p><br/><p>Reginleif also laughed. She showed an excessive movement as if she was acting and put on a sad expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cWarriors! Forgive me for not being able to fill all of your glasses. You are just too much, and we are merely three! You can\u2019t wait some hours to drink your first glass, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was merely a joke but the warriors all burst out in laughter. Reginleif swung her cape.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever we also know refinement. Today, my sister Rasgrid will fill the glasses of the two people that performed the best! It\u2019s none other than the ice princess Rasgrid!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOhh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRasgrid!\u201d</p><br/><p>The warriors cheered and Rasgrid frowned when she was called ice princess. Tae Ho, who was at the front, had to grit his teeth to try not to laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201cWarrior of Thor\u2019s legion, warrior Bracky!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne man army!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cInvincible warrior!\u201d</p><br/><p>As Reginleif named him, the warriors all yelled Bracky\u2019s nickname. Bracky let out a fresh laugh and got on the platform. As he, who was huge even among the warriors of Valhalla stood in front of her, Reginleif admired him brightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really are big!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally big!\u201d</p><br/><p>Reginleif stood on her tiptoes, but she didn\u2019t even reach Bracky\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cReginleif.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rasgrid said this coldly and lowly as if telling her to stop at that point. Reginleif shot a playful eye gesture at Bracky as if teasing her and then took out a side step and yelled, \u201cWarrior of Idun\u2019s legion, warrior Tae Ho!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe warrior that had a Valkyrie meet him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe warrior that rode on a Valkyrie!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun!\u201d</p><br/><p>The warriors cheered again. Rasgrid frowned at the vague title while Tae Ho cleared his throat and stood in front of Reginleif.</p><br/><p>Bracky smirked and said to Tae Ho, \u201cIt\u2019s a cool day.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>They had spoken for the first time today, but they felt friendly enough. You could say that he was an ally that he had faced a life and death battle with.</p><br/><p>Reginleif gave Bracky and Tae Ho each a cup of alcohol made with horn. When that process was over, Rasgrid took a deep breath and stood in front of the two people while holding a bottle of alcohol.</p><br/><p>\u201cWarrior Bracky, will you accept alcohol from me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo I have a choice?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Bracky answered in an unexpectedly well-mannered way, Rasgrid even lowered her posture to fill the cup easier. Bright red alcohol quickly filled the cup.</p><br/><p>\u201cWarrior Tae Ho.\u201d</p><br/><p>The next was Tae Ho\u2019s turn. Just like there was that feeling with Bracky and Tae Ho, Rasgrid and Tae Ho also had the same feeling between them. Rasgrid filled his cup and then put on a faint smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rasgrid greeted Bracky and Tae Ho with her eyes and then took a step back. Reginleif, who\u2019d seen all of this, laughed and stepped up.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, warriors! Raise your cups! Let\u2019s be happy with today\u2019s victory!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bracky and Tae Ho turned back to look at the warriors. There was something that filled their chests when they saw the two thousand warriors raising their cups.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Asgard and the nine planets!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Asgard!\u201d</p><br/><p>They drank alcohol at the same time. A laughter came out even though the alcohol content was really strong.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou drink really well!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bracky hit Tae Ho\u2019s back with his palm. If he were a normal warrior he would have fell to the ground, but Tae Ho didn\u2019t even flinch with this light greeting.</p><br/><p>\u201cCertainly!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bracky laughed again and Tae Ho felt glad he invested his runes on his physical stats. Valkyrie Reginleif extended her bottle of alcohol towards the two of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cAccept some alcohol from me too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo receive alcohol twice in the same day, I really feel like living.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Bracky smiled, Reginleif put on a playful expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs warrior Tae Ho accustomed to this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m also happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t received alcohol from Heda yet.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho, Bracky, and Reginleif cheered and then emptied their cups.</p><br/><p>It was at that moment when the gates of the fortress opened with a rumbling sound. The warriors turned back in response to that big sound and then faced the Valkyrie that stood on the gates just like two days ago.</p><br/><p>Valkyrie Ingrid yelled with a composed voice this time too.</p><br/><p>\u201cWarrior Lee Tae Ho!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Tae Ho answered. The warriors all quieted down and Ingrid, who had become nervous in the atmosphere, waited for a moment and then opened her mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cMee\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMeeting!\u201d</p><br/><p>The warriors yelled faster the Ingrid.</p><br/><p>\u201cUhahahahahah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun\u2019s warrior!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cValkyrie of Idun!\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t envy or jealousy. The warriors were really enjoying this situation.</p><br/><p>Ingrid, who had her words taken out of her mouth by the yells of the two thousand warriors, put on a dumbfounded face. Heda that extended her head from behind Ingrid put on an even more dumbfounded face.</p><br/><p>\u201cWh-what is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>She had already expected it to some point because of what happened two days ago, but something beyond her expectations had happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cA! Mee! Ting!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA! Mee! Ting!\u201d</p><br/><p>The warriors yelled. The voices that didn\u2019t seem to fit at first became one and shook the fortress.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to go to Idun\u2019s legion too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUhahahaha! Thor won\u2019t forgive you then!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Idun!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor the beautiful Goddess of Life!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are beautiful Valkyrie!\u201d</p><br/><p>There was one common point between the warriors of Valhalla and the Gods of Asgard: they were all valiant and loved exalted warriors.</p><br/><p>They had seen Tae Ho\u2019s performance in today\u2019s battlefield. Because of that, they sang in admiration rather than in jealousy or envy.</p><br/><p>The warrior that had a Valkyrie meet him.</p><br/><p>The warrior that had the rights to that!</p><br/><p>The Warriors opened a path for Heda. The scene that was like Moses opening the Red Sea was really amazing.</p><br/><p>Valkyrie Ingrid laughed and moved aside and Heda that couldn\u2019t hide behind her anymore as she passed the warriors with a flushed face. As soon as she got on the platform where Tae Ho was, she quickly said, \u201cJust what did you do?\u201d</p><br/><p>She vaguely heard that he had performed greatly, but it was really vague. Ingrid told her to hear to it directly from him.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho didn\u2019t wasn\u2019t embarrassed at Heda\u2019s fluster but spoke while enjoying it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it nice? They are all yelling Idun\u2019s name.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho pointed at the warriors as if telling her to listen. The warriors were really calling for Idun\u2019s name.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou like it, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda was Idun\u2019s Valkyrie. It seemed like she got more flustered at the warriors calling for Idun\u2019s name because her face flushed even more.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be like that and wave your hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLi-like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Heda waved her hand shortly, the warriors cheered even more.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun\u2019s Valkyrie!\u201d</p><br/><p>You would become better at something with repetition. Heda was timid at first but she soon started to smile brightly and waved her hand even wider.</p><br/><p>But it was then.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe warrior that had a Valkyrie meet him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe warrior that rode on a Valkyrie!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda blinked. She could understand the first part, but not the latter.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are they talking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda turned and asked. This time Tae Ho was the one to get flustered and Bracky laughed loudly. Reginleif, who was with Bracky, approached Heda and freshly said, \u201cIt\u2019s just like they say. Warrior Tae Ho rode on top of Rasgrid. That\u2019s why he\u2019s being called that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Not firing at the enemy but at their ally.</p><br/><p>When Rasgrid let out a long and deep sigh, Heda\u2019s expression transformed even more.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 7 \u2013 Valkyrie (4) &gt; End</p><br/>\n</div>"}

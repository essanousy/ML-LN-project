Most of it got destroyed mercilessly and the sturdiest among them, the fortress called the impregnable fortress got destroyed completely to the point no safe walls remained in it.</p><br/><p>Now that the Five Gates got destroyed, Kum Oh Do would now get exposed to the enemy. Hyunwoo Cheon had no method to stop the rolling disaster that was 500 meters long.</p><br/><p>\u2018I have to endure.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hyunwoo Cheon rose up and mumbled. He had to hold. He had to endure no matter what he did at least until Tongtian Jiaozhu returned.</p><br/><p>\u2018If only the Great master returned, if only he did so.\u2019</p><br/><p>There was still a way. They still had the last card remaining.</p><br/><p>It was deep in the night. Dawn was approaching.</p><br/><p>The rolling disaster stopped above the last of the Five Gates and wasn\u2019t moving. It seemed like it had spent all of its strength.</p><br/><p>It was an obvious thing. It would spend an overwhelming amount of strength with a single roll just with moving a body of that size.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s wait. Let\u2019s not attack rashly.\u2019</p><br/><p>The master of Asgard was along that rolling disaster. He was a monster among monsters that had suppressed the Kingdom of Fire that had come from the south.</p><br/><p>Hyunwoo Cheon took a breath. Time was on the side of Kum Oh Do. The Great grandmaster would arrive soon and if that happened they would be able to prepare a card to counterattack.</p><br/><p>The 13 sages that were scattered everywhere in Kum Oh Do were returning and gathering.</p><br/><p>Kum Oh Do wasn\u2019t actually an island. The peaks of the mountains pouted out from the dense sea of fog so it only looked like it was an island but actually it was a mountain range formed by big and rough mountains.</p><br/><p>The place Hyunwoo Cheon was currently at was a peak that was at the deepest part of the mountain range. He could look down on the entire Kum Oh Do from this place that had the residence of Tongtian Jiaozhu.</p><br/><p>Majul mountain.</p><br/><p>Hyunwoo Cheon looked far away from that peak. He could see the rolling disaster that was curling up from on top of the collapsed gates. He looked at that curseful existence for a bit and then turned to look away.</p><br/><p>The deepest place inside the sea of fog, a place you can\u2019t see through just by looking from far away.</p><br/><p>The last card of Kum Oh Do.</p><br/><p>Hyunwoo Cheon looked away once again. It was towards the direction where Kunlun mountain was at, where Tongtian Jiaozhu should be coming from.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>Tae Ho hid in a bush that was between the boundary of the fog and the sky and looked far away. His eyes hurt as he had been using the \u2018eyes of the dragon\u2019 for a long time but he couldn\u2019t close his eyes or stop keeping watch just because of that.</p><br/><p>The attack on Kum Oh Do was a success. He had destroyed all five gates in only a day so the entire Kum Oh Do would be in an uproar. It was obvious that the forces of Kum Oh Do that were fighting in Kunlun mountain would be jumping on their feet in bewilderment.</p><br/><p>But Tae Ho felt anxious.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t show it in front of Adenmaha or Nidhogg but time wasn\u2019t at his side.</p><br/><p>He had defeated the core existences of the enemy such as Karna, Gilgamesh, Tiamat and Jormungand but that wasn\u2019t all.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho still didn\u2019t know the entire force of Dilmun and Xindu.</p><br/><p>Karna and Gilgamesh could be compared to Sigurd in Asgard. They were certainly the strongest beings that were at the top.</p><br/><p>But that was all. Even Asgard had Thor, that was stronger than Sigurd, and there were also other top-ranked warriors that weren\u2019t as strong as Sigurd but were still powerful.</p><br/><p>Dilmun and Xindu had been weakened due to the war between the destructive beings and the ones that wanted to maintain the world. That\u2019s why there was a high probability there wouldn\u2019t be more stronger beings than Asgard, Olympus or the Temple.</p><br/><p>But those were only probabilities. He didn\u2019t know when strong beings would come flocking from the south again.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why he had to finish his business on Kum Oh Do before they came.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho\u2019s thoughts was simple.</p><br/><p>He would turn Kum Oh Do just like Jotunheim.</p><br/><p>Jotunheim had lost all of their influential figures in the second Great War excluding the Frost Giant king Harmarti.</p><br/><p>Thanks to that, Jotunheim lost their strength to fight so they weren\u2019t moving now even though the Kingdom of Fire had arisen.</p><br/><p>He had to make Kum Oh Do like that too.</p><br/><p>If he defeated Tongtian Jiaozhu and the other forces then he could remove the threat in the northern region even if he didn\u2019t destroy all of Kum Oh Do.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho counted his moves. If he could clear up the business in the northern region and focus all the forces in the south again, then he would be obtaining victory in a limited region. That was because Tae Ho would be able to lie in wait and ambush the enemy freely once again.</p><br/><p>Honestly speaking, he was worried about Olympus. Even though Thor and Odin were there and Heracles had also awoken and joined the reinforcements he couldn\u2019t help but get worried.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, that\u2019s the place you got the most meetings so it\u2019s obvious to get worried about the Goddesses that came for you. Mm, I understand. The Goddesses of Olympus were really pretty.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho frowned as Cuchulainn laughed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hey, i\u2019m also worrying about the male Gods. Such as Heracles.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Right, so what? That\u2019s everything.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018No, i\u2019m really worried about them.\u2019</p><br/><p>To only worry about the Goddesses, Tae Ho wasn\u2019t such a narrow-minded man. But Cuchulainn snorted at Tae Ho\u2019s claim and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t speak bullshit. Hey, then name some male Gods you are currently worried about. I will admit it if you name at least 8 of them.\u2019</p><br/><p>Eight Gods.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho flinched at the number that was higher than 5 but he still started to mention some names.</p><br/><p>\u2018Uh\u2026For now Heracles, Zeus, Apollo\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018And?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Hephaestus! There\u2019s also Hermes! And Prometheus too!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Wow, six people! As for the remaining two?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Uh\u2026um\u2026so\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>The names he could immediately think of were Poseidon and Ares but it didn\u2019t make sense that he was worried about them.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ah, Hades! Hades!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Wow, you are quite something. What about the remaining one?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Kugh\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, he had no more names he could remember. Cuchulainn clicked his tongue as Tae Ho stayed silent and said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tch tch tch, you childish bastard. Are you able to see the truth now?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018No, so\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018You can easily think more than ten names of Goddesses right?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Kugh\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t deny it. He could easily think of more than ten names with the ones that just popped in his head.</p><br/><p>Hera, Athena, Artemis, Persephone, Hebe, Demeter, Gaia, Hestia, Aphrodite, Kaliope, etc.</p><br/><p>But it was understandable to feel it to be a bit unfair in Tae Ho\u2019s position as he didn\u2019t face the male Gods that much but he faced more than sixty Goddesses at the meeting festival. It was obvious to remember a lot of names.</p><br/><p>When Tae Ho was struggling about how he should refute back, a low voice was heard above his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s coming.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was Siri\u2019s voice. Tae Ho hurriedly glared at the starry night at her words she spouted while covering herself, Tae Ho and Bracky with the stealth blessing. Red words got caught with his \u2018eyes of the dragon\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was worth waiting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bracky also spoke soundlessly.</p><br/><p>[Commandre of Kum Oh Do]</p><br/><p>[Tongtian Jiaozhu]</p><br/><p>Right after they destroyed the five gates, Tae Ho took place here that was the closest to the Kunlun mountain in a straight line and waited for Tongtian Jiaozhu.</p><br/><p>It was an action done by relying on probabilities rather than being certain of it.</p><br/><p>What would he do if he was in a situation that Valhalla got attacked, the gates got destroyed and he didn\u2019t know when it would fall down?</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know if the path was blocked due to an army but if that wasn\u2019t the case then almost all the Gods would act the same way.</p><br/><p>First, he would go to Valhalla alone.</p><br/><p>Thor would also do the same and the same went for Odin. Tae Ho also would have done the same.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why he thought that Tongtian Jiaozhu would act that way. That he would return to Kum Oh Do with all his strength even if he was alone while leaving behind a considerable number of his force and strong specters to stop Son Wukong and the pursuit unit of Kunlun.</p><br/><p>His guess was correct. He wasn\u2019t completely alone as he had some underlings with him but if they were at that level then it was no different from being alone.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg\u2019s existence was really vast. They saw Nidhogg from far away and would think that Tae Ho\u2019s group would also be with it.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why they would stab on the blind spot. They would ambush the commander of the enemy that was only concentrating on returning.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho raised his bow. It was a big bow that was used when fighting against giants and could use a spear as an arrow.</p><br/><p>Siri embraced Tae Ho from behind as he took a firing stance. Precisely speaking, she grabbed the bow with Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho nocked Gae Bolg on the bowstring. And then pulled it with Siri.</p><br/><p>Siri stopped breathing and Tae Ho did the same. He didn\u2019t take the lead and matched her movements.</p><br/><p>Tongtian Jiaozhu crossed the night sky and at some point Siri fired the arrow.</p><br/><p>[Saga: The arrow of the witch never misses its target]</p><br/><p>Gae Bolg charged towards Tongtian Jiaozhu. It was the attack of the witch that couldn\u2019t be avoided.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>Tongtian Jiaozhu, that had only been charging in the air while only looked at Kum Oh Do, turned his gaze suddenly. It was because he noticed the existence of Gae Bolg that surged up from below.</p><br/><p>But it was too late. In addition, the projectile that contained Siri\u2019s saga couldn\u2019t be avoided with simple movements.</p><br/><p>Gae Bolg broke through an invisible barrier that was spread in a hurry. It pierced the thigh of Tongtian Jiaozhu and spread the curse of death.</p><br/><p>It was an unforeseen attack.</p><br/><p>Tongtian Jiaozhu didn\u2019t lose consciousness even under the terrible pain and made a quick judgment. He moved his hand to cut off his own leg that got stabbed by Gae Bolg.</p><br/><p>It was to stop the curse of death from spreading.</p><br/><p>Tongtian Jiaozhu gritted his teeth and held back a scream and started to stop the hemorrhage hurriedly. He let out a rough breath and glared at the direction Gae Bolg came flying from.</p><br/><p>Arros got fired consecutively. Each one of them also flew towards Tongtian Jiaozhu precisely.</p><br/><p>But it didn\u2019t have the same strength like Gae Bolg. Tongtian Jiaozhu swept some wind to send the arrows flying away.</p><br/><p>A strong arrow that came flying as if waiting for that exact moment pierced the shoulder of Tongtian Jiaozhu.</p><br/><p>\u201cKugh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tongtian Jiaozhu groaned and glared at the direction the arrow came flying from. A golden-haired woman that seemed to be a Goddess of Asgard was pulling the bowstring. It was an incredible bow skill that was comparable to the great hero of the Temple \u2018Ye\u2019.</p><br/><p>The arrow left the bowstring once again. Tongtian Jiaozhu created a strong wind to stop the path of the arrow and judged quickly.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t the time to be facing the bow master. He had to leave this place quickly as there may be another trap.</p><br/><p>He ordered the specters that had been following him to attack the woman firing arrows and he headed to Kum Oh Do. But his escape couldn\u2019t continue for long.</p><br/><p>Gae Bolg chased after him and then the one that possessed the \u2018eyes of the dragon\u2019 stopped his path.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster of Asgard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tongtian Jiaozhu said but Tae Ho didn\u2019t reply. He pulled Astelone and the Sword of the round table to finish Tongtian Jiaozhu that had gotten weaker for having allowed an attack from Gae Bolg.</p><br/><p>The sentences of Erin and Asgard surged up at the same time and shocked the night sky. Tongtian Jiaozhu sensed his death at the overwhelming divine power that seemed to explode.</p><br/><p>But he wasn\u2019t thinking of losing easily. He was planning to have a fierce battle.</p><br/><p>However, he wasn\u2019t able to win.</p><br/><p>The surprise attack was effective. The first attack decreased the probabilities Tongtian Jiaozhu had to win that wasn\u2019t that high in the first place.</p><br/><p>Because of that Tongtian Jiaozhu was able to make a faster decision than usual.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s die together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tongtian Jiaozhu said. He released a vast amount of strength that fitted the commander of Kum Oh Do and transmitted one order to Kum Oh Do.</p><br/><p>[Activate it Hyunwoo Cheon.]</p><br/><p>The last card of Kum Oh Do.</p><br/><p>Tongtian Jiaozhu made a smile. At that moment Tae Ho flinched and looked behind him.</p><br/><p>The sea of fog was splitting far away.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s calling me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg rubbed her eyes and said. Adenmaha, that had been sleeping while embracing her, blinked and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cNidhogg?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s calling me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg said once again. Echidna also stood up perhaps because she woke up at that sound or she also woke up from the call of another being.</p><br/><p>Echidna was certainly lower ranked than Nidhogg. But she was also an ancient dragon and that\u2019s why she was able to hear it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s calling me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Echidna spoke the sea of fog split in two. Then, a black and huge existence showed itself.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 70 \u2013 Sword of the World Dragon (4) &gt; End</p><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/>\n</div>"}

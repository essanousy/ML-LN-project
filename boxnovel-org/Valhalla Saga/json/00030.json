He cut his breath short and looked at his surroundings.</p><br/><p>The first thing he saw were the high trees. The trees were lined up like a wall and the branches were interlinked, making a ceiling that covered the sky. The reason why it was dark was probably because of the resulting shadows.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho took one more step. There was dirt, rotting branches, and browning leaves everywhere. As he breathed slowly, he could feel the cold and humid air.</p><br/><p>Most of all, his body felt heavy. He didn\u2019t know if that was the precise expression, but the gravity itself felt different. Although the difference wasn\u2019t that great, it\u2019s not as if there was none. In terms of numbers, it would be 1.1 times more.</p><br/><p>Half of the warriors that were ahead of Tae Ho looked at their surroundings as if it were marvelous while the other half remained on guard with casual faces as if it wasn\u2019t their first trip. Siri, who was the first one to pass through the door, belonged to the latter category.</p><br/><p>\u2018So this is Svartalfheim.\u2019</p><br/><p>The land of the dark fairies that had a name that could twist your tongue.</p><br/><p>\u2018So the dark fairies are the dark elves?\u2019</p><br/><p>As he started to think of slim beauties with copper skin, a laugh came from behind him.</p><br/><p>\u201cAmazing right? This place is Svartalfheim.\u201d</p><br/><p>Valkyrie Gandur, who crossed the door last, walked to the front and gave an explanation to the warriors that had never been here before.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs you can see, this place is almost entirely covered by shadows thanks to the branches. In addition, since this forest is really vast, regardless of it being day or night, it\u2019s always dark. The reason why Svartalfheim is called the world of the endless night is because of this.\u201d</p><br/><p>As the warriors of Valhalla nodded with impressed faces, Gandur started to explain in more detail as if she was excited.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe ones living in this forest are mostly dark fairies\u2026..Therefore, if you cross the forest boundaries, there\u2019s Nidavellir and the land of the dwarves called Dvergr. So two races live in the same place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDwarves also live in forests?\u201d</p><br/><p>As one of the warriors asked this, Gandur shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is a forest, but Nidavellir is more of an underground world. The place is like a maze because it\u2019s built with several tunnels. If you somehow end up there, be careful not to get lost.\u201d</p><br/><p>Simply put, the dark fairies lived in the forest and the dwarves lived underground.</p><br/><p>In addition, her words seemed to indicate that this task was related to the dark fairies and not the dwarves.</p><br/><p>\u201cGandur, what is our task? It\u2019s about time for you to tell us.\u201d</p><br/><p>As one of the warriors asked again, Gandur fixed her expression and then started explaining seriously.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe dark fairies have asked us to defeat some monsters. They say that one of the dark fairy families was harvesting a medicinal plant for Valhalla and woke up a basilisk near here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen you say basilisk, do you mean the king of snakes?\u201d</p><br/><p>After Siri asked this question, carefully Gandur nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that basilisk. The family that was attacked asked for assistance from the Dark Fairy Congress, and the Congress asked Valhalla to defeat it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s why we\u2019re here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The warriors looked at themselves as if they understood. Gandur also nodded this time.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, our legion specializes in hunting. We are the best at hunting monsters.\u201d</p><br/><p>Most of the warriors in Ullr\u2019s legion were hunters.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m also expecting a lot from you. Rasgrid makes it seem like you can handle monsters really well,\u201d Gandur said while looking at Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>He then realized one thing.</p><br/><p>\u2018So Rasgrid was the culprit.\u2019</p><br/><p>He wondered why he, who belonged to Idun\u2019s legion, was dragged into a legion with specialized hunters.</p><br/><p>As he looked towards a place in the distance and laughed, Rolph approached him and patted his shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is also fate.\u201d</p><br/><p>His words were to console him, but his face was smiling. If he hadn\u2019t come here, then Rolph would have been alone.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho returned a complicated smile to Rolph and then concentrated again on Gandur. She continued with her fluid words.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor now on you will be travelling to the liaison office nearby. I will go to the Congress to take care of some things with the dark fairies. So Siri, you lead the troop and visit the troubled family.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri hit her chest lightly and expressed her manners. It seemed like Siri would be the actual commander, just like dwarven mine case.</p><br/><p>Gandur also hit her chest and talked to the warriors.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one more thing I have to tell you. They will be especially moving with the white silences on this occasion.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhite silence!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOhh! White silence!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m finally riding on one!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even before Gandur finished speaking, the warriors were letting out cheers. As they were all inferior ranked warriors, they didn\u2019t seem like they would cheer without even knowing what it was like the lowest ranked warriors, but he didn\u2019t have the courage to ask.</p><br/><p>\u2018Just what is it this time?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Is it also a projectile, which is a fetish for Valhalla warriors?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Or is it an object that silences you for eternity?\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho looked at Rolph cheering together with the others. In the end, he approached Siri and asked, \u201cSiri, what\u2019s the white silence?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really cool. You will also like it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri answered like a warrior of Valhalla and so Tae Ho looked at Gandur with an uneasy expression.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>\u201cWow!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the real thing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really big!\u201d</p><br/><p>The dark fairies liaison office was made by carving a really big tree and a really marvelous one, but no one paid attention to it. It was because they were all busy with the white silences Gandur had called.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s really cool.\u2019</p><br/><p>Even if Siri was a warrior of Valhalla, it seemed like reason and logic worked with her because the white silence was a really cool obj-no, beast, even in Tae Ho\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>There were huge wolves with white fur. They were so big he couldn\u2019t even compare them to the tigers or lions he\u2019d seen at the zoo. They were so big they could even handle the warriors of Valhalla as they were almost equal in size.</p><br/><p>There were exactly 10 wolves. Just like the number of warriors.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere will be people seeing them for the first time so to explain it briefly, they are one of the prideful summons of Ullr\u2019s legion. They can obviously walk, and when they run they don\u2019t make any noise. That\u2019s the reason why they are called white silences. They will also be of great help in battle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just like Gandur had explained, they white silences were really silent. It was a really marvelous to see those big things moving without making any noise.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do all legions have their own summons?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018So what could Idun\u2019s legion summon be?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Wait, do we even have one?\u2019</p><br/><p>Heda hadn\u2019t told him anything, and Ullr\u2019s legion was a hunter\u2019s legion, so it was understandable for them to have wolves, but that wasn\u2019t the case with Idun\u2019s legion. The only thing he could think of right now was an apple tree.</p><br/><p>\u2018What kind of animals would Odin\u2019s legion have?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be a really cool animal since he\u2019s the king of Gods?\u2019</p><br/><p>While Tae Ho was thinking of a different thing, the warriors got on the white silences one by one. Although they were hunters through and thorough, excluding Siri and a few others, the remaining ones rode on the wolves quite awkwardly.</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho, hurry up and get on one. It feels really great to mount it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rolph, who had a sloppy posture, spoke with a face that said that he would die of happiness. Tae Ho nodded once and then got on the white silence.</p><br/><p>[ Saga: The One That Can Handle Dragons ]</p><br/><p>The white silence that was on his side in the first place didn\u2019t resist him. The moment he activated the saga his posture was automatically fixed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really are skilled. It\u2019s just like Rasgrid and Reginleif said. I really want you,\u201d said Gandur in a low voice, but since he was next to her he could hear everything she had said. Perhaps, the one Heda had to worry about wasn\u2019t Rasgrid but Gandur.</p><br/><p>In addition, Siri had the same eyes as Gandur. Rolph also seemed to think that it would be good if he were in the same legion as Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>As Tae Ho thought of Heda\u2019s face and shifted his eyes, Gandur smirked and said, \u201cA guide from the fairies side will come with you. Follow him.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as she finished speaking, a dark fairy riding on a black horse approached them. She wasn\u2019t the slim beauty with copper skin Tae Ho had expected \u2014 he was a handsome youth with light violet skin.</p><br/><p>\u2018Even so, he\u2019s similar to the dark elves that I know of.\u2019</p><br/><p>His ears were pointy, his face was handsome, and his body was slim. His skin had a light violet color that had a pastel feel to it and silver hair that was nearly white paired well with his skin.</p><br/><p>The dark fairy that was wearing brown leather armor placed his right hand on his left chest and saluted, perhaps because everyone else was riding their wolves.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Tollaris from the Mollo family. I will be leading you to our family\u2019s house.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Siri from Ullr\u2019s legion. Treat us well.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Siri also hit her chest to express her manners, Tollaris nodded and looked back at Gandur.</p><br/><p>\u201cValkyrie Gandur, we will depart immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet Ullr\u2019s blessing be with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet Ullr\u2019s blessing be with Gandur!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Valkyrie of our legion is certainly the best!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will be going!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will bring you the leather of the basilisk as a gift!\u201d</p><br/><p>As Gandur waved her hand and sent them off, the warriors of Ullr\u2019s legion raised their voices and answered back. It was rough, but you could feel their affection towards Gandur, the Valkyrie of Ullr\u2019s legion.</p><br/><p>Tollaris just looked at them silently and then charged forward. As Siri followed him, the warriors also started to follow suit.</p><br/><p>The white silences weren\u2019t only silent, they were also fast. Tollaris\u2019s horse galloped really quickly, but no wolf fell behind. Or rather, it seemed like they were faster than the horse in bulky places where roots were sprouting.</p><br/><p>However, the best thing was how it felt when you boarded them. Normally your butt would hurt when riding on a horse even with a saddle, but you couldn\u2019t feel any of that with the white silences when they suddenly changed direction or speed. Perhaps this was because of their cushiony fur.</p><br/><p>Tollaris ran for a quarter of a day while resting at times. Because they were in such a dense forest that covered the sky, it was hard to determine their location or direction.</p><br/><p>But they were certain that they come a long way from the starting point.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tollaris lowered his speed to a walking pace and pointed to a far place. Tae Ho, who had gotten accustomed to the forest while coming all the way here, discovered that the village was composed of tree houses.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s like a village of a single family.\u2019</p><br/><p>The dark fairy said that everyone that resided here were from the Mollo family bloodline. The dark fairies guarding the entrance looked at the warriors of Valhalla with vigilant eyes, and the kids also peeked at them while hiding behind the trees.</p><br/><p>The warriors of Valhalla looked at the village with curious eyes instead of shrinking back from the many gazes, just like ideal Valhalla warriors.</p><br/><p>As they entered deep into the forest, a house covered by fences appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go in.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Tollaris dismounted from the horse, Siri and the other warriors also dismounted from the white silences.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can just place them in the stables. Just place them far away from the horses.\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri said this towards the dark fairies that had put on troubled faces as they were thinking about what to do. Although they were summoned, it seemed like the Valkyrie was the only one that could order them as she pleased.</p><br/><p>After they passed the gates, they saw a huge house with a wide yard. It was marvelous that they were still covered by branches with a house as huge as that.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have troubled yourselves by coming this far. I\u2019m Mallus, the head of the Mollo family.\u201d</p><br/><p>A slim man with a sharp impression welcomed them from the yard. As the man waved his hand lightly, beautiful dark fairies appeared and gave each of the warriors a cup. It seemed like they were telling them to ease their thirst for having come a long way.</p><br/><p>There was no reason for the warriors of Valhalla to refuse when they were wild for alcohol. Siri also accepted it while thinking that one cup wouldn\u2019t do harm.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho also did the same. But before he was about to place his lips on his cup, he activated the dragon\u2019s eyes just like how he always did so when he faced someone new.</p><br/><p>Tollaris\u2019 name was green. There were many dark fairies in the village that had grey names which meant neutrality. Anyways, most of them were green or grey.</p><br/><p>But it was different for the house.</p><br/><p>[ Utgard Loki\u2019s underling ]</p><br/><p>[ Dark fairy: Mallus ]</p><br/><p>Clear red words. In addition, he had already seen the name: Utgard Loki.</p><br/><p>\u2018The giant from the Black Fortress!\u2019</p><br/><p>Utgard Loki\u2019s warrior, Hgut.</p><br/><p>There was no time to think. There was an enemy right in front of them, yet they were currently drinking alcohol from the enemy.</p><br/><p>\u201cCaptain Siri!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho yelled and threw his cup. The warriors that had already taken a sip were surprised and turned to look at Tae Ho. Rolph opened his eyes wide as if he was flustered. However, Siri was different. She threw away her cup and also spat the alcohol out of her mouth.</p><br/><p>Mallus looked at Tae Ho. He didn\u2019t know about Tae Ho\u2019s saga. However, the moment he saw Tae Ho\u2019s eyes filled with certainty, he made a quick judgment. He raised his arm instead of making a sloppy excuse. Red words started to appear on the walls.</p><br/><p>\u201cHit them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShield wall!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mallus and Siri yelled at the same time. The warriors of Valhalla hurriedly raised their shields and the dark fairies that appeared from everywhere fired their bows.</p><br/><p>Tollaris and the dark fairy ladies that were near them looked at their surroundings with flustered faces and fell after being hit by the arrows.</p><br/><p>The dark fairies screamed. The house was filled with green words, grey words, and red words.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeal the door!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are escaping!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mallus and Siri yelled at the same time again. The dark fairies in grey ran towards the gate, and some of the warriors hid behind the shields and fired their crossbows towards the dark fairies that were trying to close the gate. Siri pulled back the shield wall and then blew her horn trumpet.</p><br/><p>The white silences reacted to the sound that resembled the wind. They bit down or slammed the dark fairies that were trying to tie them down. They ran across the yard and approached the group.</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho! Take lead!\u201d Siri said while hurriedly mounting onto the white silence. It was because she trusted Tae Ho\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho glared at the half-closed gates and yelled, \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>The white silences charged soundlessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cClose the gates!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mallus yelled again. The dark fairies ran towards the entrance while Rolph and the warriors raised their crossbows once more. A rain of arrows hailed from above their heads.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho only looked in front of him and charged. He didn\u2019t dodge the arrows coming from the front. He stormed towards the gate and extended his left hand. He activated the carved rune magic!</p><br/><p>\u201cGant!\u201d</p><br/><p>Rune of wind.</p><br/><p>A strong wind surged from Tae Ho\u2019s left arm.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 9 \u2013 Svartalfheim (1) &gt; End</p><br/>\n</div>"}

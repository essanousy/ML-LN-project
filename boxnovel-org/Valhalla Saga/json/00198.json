The walls that had Artemis\u2019 blessing in it couldn\u2019t endure the roll of a dragon that was 100 meters big.</p><br/><p>Consecutive earthquakes shook the polis. Nidhogg spread down because she had clashed against the wall too strongly but she had successfully accomplished her role and more.</p><br/><p>The soldiers of Artemis trembled as Adenmaha and Rolo fired their respective breaths. The breath fired by Drakon Ismenios swept away everything in the hole that Nidhogg created and established a new road.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho glared at the center of the city with his \u2018eyes of the dragon\u2019. There was a hidden room in this polis that could be considered the core just like Delphos had.</p><br/><p>[Saga: The warrior that had a Goddess meet him]</p><br/><p>[Saga: Equipment of the dragon knight]</p><br/><p>Ten Valkyries got summoned next to Tae Ho. They all grabbed a weapon and charged forward. There were still a lot of Artemis\u2019 forces but already half of them had been intercepted by the dragons.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho followed the path created by the sword of the Valkyries and concentrated on his \u2018eyes of the dragon\u2019. He finally discovered the hidden room when he reached the center of the city.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou villains! Where do you think this is that you misbehave!\u201d</p><br/><p>A woman that was estimated to be Artemis\u2019 maiden took out a big bow and stopped the path of the group. It seemed like what she was showing wasn\u2019t a bluff that Artemis\u2019 aura swelled up among the maidens and tried to devour the group.</p><br/><p>But Tae Ho\u2019s dark blue divinity surged up to block Artemis\u2019 divinity. He could easily defend against it as it wasn\u2019t Artemis herself that activated the divinity but one of her maidens.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat misconduct are you talking about!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ismenios let out a roar and attacked the maidens. Almost all the citizens were under Artemis\u2019 control but they weren\u2019t born as beings wanting to destroy the world in the first place so Tae Ho had said to minimize unnecessary sacrifices but they weren\u2019t in a situation to be at ease.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho closed the distance with the place that was connected to the room underground and mumbled.</p><br/><p>\u201cI suddenly miss McLaren.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018I was about to forget his name.\u2019</p><br/><p>The rock serpent that should be in the residence of Idun. He was the best when it came to digging the ground.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho remembered of the times he spent with McLaren and then slammed the ground with his conquering divinity. He turned to look at Adenmaha and Rolo that were stopping the army of Artemis from the rear and in the air and Ismenios that was blocking the maidens and grabbed Gae Bolg.</p><br/><p>He called out a name at the end of his pondering.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsmenios!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster!\u201d</p><br/><p>Drakon Ismenios got moved and yelled and then spread his wings and flew up. Tae Ho got on top of him by leaping in the air and activated \u2018the one that conquers dragons\u2019. He surged up vertically and prepared to also descend vertically.</p><br/><p>What he would use is the \u2018dragon cannon\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster! Please, \u2018the warrior that rode on a Goddess\u2019 too!\u201d</p><br/><p>Drakon Ismenios spoke with an earnest voice but Tae Ho didn\u2019t listen to him. The power would be enough even if they didn\u2019t do that!</p><br/><p>[Saga: Dragon cannon]</p><br/><p>Draconic Ballista!</p><br/><p>The attack that fell from the sky hit the ground. The several layers of the ground crumbled down and the hidden room finally appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cArtemis.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho spoke in a low voice and jumped down from Ismenios\u2019 back.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>Artemis couldn\u2019t return to her sacred force. Part of it was because of the distance but it was also because there was someone obstructing her.</p><br/><p>Echidna handed over the commanding right of her army to her children and chased after Artemis stubbornly. Atalante tried to help her but it was impossible. She couldn\u2019t even move her fast feet properly because of the joint attack of Siri and Bracky.</p><br/><p>Bracky pressured her closely and if she tried to make some distance Siri would pour down arrows at her and hinder her movements. Bracky would close the distance once again.</p><br/><p>It was simple but a hard combination to get out of.</p><br/><p>Dionysius called out Artemis name in the middle of the battle. It was because it wouldn\u2019t be late if she got a hold of herself at least now.</p><br/><p>But Artemis\u2019 thought was different. Dionysius didn\u2019t know what she had seen and what Idun\u2019s warrior was doing.</p><br/><p>\u201cArtemis!\u201d</p><br/><p>The one that yelled this time was Echidna. Artemis, that was only thinking of getting away from the battlefield, cursed out and glared at Echidna. She raised her bow to try to shake Echidna off as she was sticking to her persistently.</p><br/><p>\u201cDie!\u201d</p><br/><p>The arrow of the God of hunt flew directly to Echidna\u2019s forehead. Artemis took out her second arrow after a moment of hesitation and then inserted a stronger divine power into her arrow.</p><br/><p>Echidna gulped dry saliva. Athena was indeed one of the 12 Olympians. In addition, she had gotten stronger after she turned into a being wanting to destroy the world so it wasn\u2019t easy to overcome her.</p><br/><p>If she was inside her city of monsters, that was her sacred force, she was confident even when facing one of the 12 Olympians but she was outside of her city.</p><br/><p>In addition, she had handed over her sacred force completely to Tae Ho so she had become weaker than before.</p><br/><p>Could she also block the next arrow? Could she buy time like Tae Ho had ordered her to?</p><br/><p>Echidna didn\u2019t have time to think. She just concentrated her divine power and raised a barrier.</p><br/><p>Kwagang!</p><br/><p>The second arrow destroyed the barrier. It didn\u2019t stop there and also destroyed Echidna\u2019s scales and carved in her flesh.</p><br/><p>This arrow was really small compared to Echidna\u2019s body but the shock couldn\u2019t be described with words. Echidna gulped her scream and pain and glared at Artemis. She had activated the power of her evil eyes and Artemis hesitated a moment but then fended it off. She rather nocked her third arrow.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the end.\u201d</p><br/><p>She would kill the big snake and charge towards her sacred force with all her power.</p><br/><p>But it was at that moment.</p><br/><p>Artemis felt a pain in her chest and screamed in pain. Echidna, that had flinched, drew a smile.</p><br/><p>The divine power of Artemis was weakening.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>The hidden room was filled with Artemis\u2019 divine power. The moment Tae Ho entered the room that had the same structure as the room of Apollo in Delphos, felt like he had been trapped deep in the sea.</p><br/><p>Artemis\u2019 divinity opposed Tae Ho. It wanted to kill Tae Ho and disperse his divinity.</p><br/><p>But he had already expected this. He pushed away Artemis\u2019 divine power after covering himself with the dark blue divinity. He released his divine power in an instant and placed his hand on a yellow sphere that was at the center of the room.</p><br/><p>If he couldn\u2019t take it he would destroy it so no one could have it.</p><br/><p>The divinity of the God of conquer dug inside the nucleus of the sacred force.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>Artemis staggered. Her sacred force still existed but the connection became worse. She was sure one of the polises inside her sacred force got destroyed completely or got taken over.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe has weakened.\u201d</p><br/><p>Echidna said and Artemis let out an enraged roar at her voice. The urgency took away her sense of judgement.</p><br/><p>Artemis fired arrows in consecution. Echidna giggled at that and just focused on defense.</p><br/><p>She would buy time.</p><br/><p>She would wait until Artemis became weaker than her.</p><br/><p>Nasty flames came out of Echidna\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>Tae Ho staggered after he destroyed the nucleus of the polis. Destroying the nucleus of a sacred force that Artemis made with much labor wasn\u2019t easy at all. He ended up spending a lot of divine power and stamina.</p><br/><p>But this wasn\u2019t the time to stop. Tae Ho took out an entire golden apple and called Hermes after he devoured it.</p><br/><p>The God of Olympus Hermes looked at Tae Ho with fear, joy and disgust. It was an obvious thing to show rejection as he had seen the sacred force of a God of Olympus get destroyed forcefully.</p><br/><p>But Hermes knew how to differentiate effort and company. In addition Tae Ho was an ally now.</p><br/><p>Hermes grabbed Tae Ho\u2019s hand and he entrusted his everything on Hermes\u2019 divine power.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo the next polis.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hermes flew with Tae Ho with his winged shoes Talaria.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>Artemis wasn\u2019t the only one that got weakened. Atalante had also become weaker. All the heroes of Artemis had part of their strength cut off.</p><br/><p>Dionysius understood immediately what happened and also understood why Artemis had done something mad.</p><br/><p>This battle was a complete mistake. He couldn\u2019t have imagined that Echidna and her children would be at the same side of Idun\u2019s warrior.</p><br/><p>\u2018Did Hermes too?\u2019</p><br/><p>It was understandable then. If he was with Hermes he would be able to attack all the polises of Artemis. Not only that but they could also add the polises of Dionysius into the fray.</p><br/><p>Dionysius felt anxiousness. He turned his head to look for Artemis.</p><br/><p>Artemis was fighting against Echidna.</p><br/><p>And that battle wasn\u2019t advantageous to her at all.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m \u2013 rolling!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg destroyed the walls once again and collapsed. But it was enough like always.</p><br/><p>The order was as followed. Adenmaha, Rolo and Ismenios created commotion and stopped the attacks of the enemy and Tae Ho found the hidden room.</p><br/><p>\u2018How many can you break?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018At least four. That\u2019s what I promised.\u2019</p><br/><p>[Saga: The warrior that rode on a Goddess]</p><br/><p>[Saga: Dragon cannon]</p><br/><p>Rolo- no, Tae Ho rode on Lilly and destroyed the ground with the draconic ballista. Drakon Ismenios grumbled saying that it was favoritism and Lilly put a displeased face.</p><br/><p>\u2018Really, why are you like that? Do you have some emotions towards Rolo?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m lacking strength.\u2019</p><br/><p>Simply looking at strength, Ismenios was the best. But Tae Ho had ended up spending too much of his strength and divine power while taking over the first polis. He needed to be faster to destroy the ground.</p><br/><p>WHatever the case, the important thing was that the hidden room had appeared. This room didn\u2019t only have Artemis\u2019 divine power but also moving statues as guards but it didn\u2019t matter. Tae Ho destroyed them in an instant and placed his hand once again in the round sphere.</p><br/><p>God of conquer.</p><br/><p>The dark blue divinity covered the second polis.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>\u201cAck!\u201d</p><br/><p>Artemis ended up dropping her bow and clenched her chest.</p><br/><p>Echidna didn\u2019t miss that moment and fired out poison and Artemis hurriedly threw herself and rolled on the ground.</p><br/><p>The blue wolf got covered in the poison so it let out a pained scream and rolled on the ground and it passed away not long after.</p><br/><p>Echidna laughed. Artemis had surged up her golden divinity once again but she had become considerably weaker.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow long can you hold on?\u201d</p><br/><p>Echidna licked her lips. She had the eyes of a cat playing with her food.</p><br/><p>Artemis cursed out and grabbed her bow with trembling hands.</p><br/><p>And right at that moment.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho and Hermes were heading to the third polis.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>Apollo was looking at the battlefield through the eyes of her maidens.</p><br/><p>The situation was flowing like they had first planned. Artemis\u2019 strength was getting drastically weakened as she relied on her sacred forces too much, especially among the 12 Olympians.</p><br/><p>Apollo felt pain while looking at her sister being in pain.</p><br/><p>His hands trembled because he wanted to hit and kill Echidna, that was harassing his sister.</p><br/><p>But he had to endure it. He had to wait for the moment.</p><br/><p>Apollo raised his hands and covered his eyes but he couldn\u2019t completely block Artemis\u2019 screams.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>Dionysius sensed a dense sign of defeat. The battlefield was still being maintained because the forces he had brought were a lot but it was only to that point. They couldn\u2019t win and it was impossible to take most of his forces and retreat.</p><br/><p>Atalante couldn\u2019t win either. The Goddess of the foreign world that had ears of a wolf aimed for her lower body really stubbornly. Atalante couldn\u2019t run properly as she had been hit in her thighs and calves by several arrows.</p><br/><p>\u2018Isn\u2019t it glad that i\u2019m not here?\u2019</p><br/><p>Dionysius\u2019 shinsoo was the one at this place instead of him.</p><br/><p>Dionysius gritted his teeth and turned to look at Artemis, and then frowned.</p><br/><p>Artemis was sitting down while clenching her chest after firing an arrow. Tears fell down from her poor eyes, and her divinity that had become a mess wasn\u2019t a flashy gold anymore.</p><br/><p>She had suffered damage as her sacred force got destroyed but it was seen as she failed operating her divinity because of the drastic change in emotions.</p><br/><p>Echidna fired strong poison towards that Artemis. Artemis rolled on the ground hurriedly and dodged the poison but it was really pitiful to see a Goddess rolling on the ground.</p><br/><p>The nucleus of four polises got destroyed. But it wasn\u2019t simply four. They were the most important places of Artemis sacred force.</p><br/><p>Echidna looked down at Artemis and giggled. She transformed into a Goddess and wrapped Artemis with her tail and gave her pain.</p><br/><p>Artemis made breathtaking sounds. Echidna wrapped her with more strength and in the end Artemis ended up dropping her bow. It seemed like the parts of her body that got infected with Echidna\u2019s poison was screaming.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s up to there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Echidna turned her head at the voice filled with grief. The God of light Apollo was standing there and it wasn\u2019t an illusion but the real deal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs you wish.\u201d</p><br/><p>Echidna smiled in a fishy way and released her. Apollo hurriedly received ARtemis with his arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cApollo?\u201d</p><br/><p>The one that spoke in a bewildered way was Athena. She felt uneasy because of Apollo\u2019s sudden appearance while she was fighting with the Valkyries.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you planning-.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Apollo cut off Athena\u2019s words. He knew what Athena was thinking about. Aren\u2019t you going to betray us because of your love towards your sister, or take Artemis and flee?</p><br/><p>That won\u2019t happen. He didn\u2019t think like that. Apollo was the God of rationality.</p><br/><p>Athena opened her eyes widely and glared at Apollo. Echidna fell back obediently to the point it was unexpected and then watched Apollo and Artemis embracing each other. It seemed that compared to Athena, she had kind of expected this situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou became really weak.\u201d</p><br/><p>Apollo said. Artemis barely opened her eyes and looked at Apollo with resentment, enmity, killing intent and endless affection.</p><br/><p>\u201cAthena, remember what I said.\u201d</p><br/><p>About not trusting Asgard too much. That they had to protect Olympus.</p><br/><p>Athena opened her eyes roundly. It was because she understood what Apollo was about to do. She also understood why he had talked about what would happen after the battle even though the counterattack had just started.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s fall asleep together. Let\u2019s wake up together believing that all of this was a nightmare.\u201d</p><br/><p>Apollo spoke gently and stroke Artemis\u2019 cheek. He covered the plentily weakened divinity of Artemis with his own divinity.</p><br/><p>Hades chose to fall in a deep slumber to not get seduced by the voice.</p><br/><p>And Apollo had also decided to do the same. He used all his strength and chose to fall asleep with ARtemis.</p><br/><p>Apollo was the God of rationality. He knew that his choice wasn\u2019t favorable for his allies. Killing Artemis and restoring Apollo\u2019s strength was much more favorable.</p><br/><p>But Apollo couldn\u2019t kill Artemis. He couldn\u2019t see her be killed.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why he negotiated with the master of Asgard.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s enough if there are no damages even after I fall asleep.\u2019</p><br/><p>Apollo smiled bitterly and placed his lips on Artemis\u2019 forehead. The two golden divinities got mixed into one and Apollo and Artemis started to transform into rock.</p><br/><p>Apollo placed down his divinity.</p><br/><p>He had conceded his seat to another God just like the previous God of sun Helios had conceded his seat to him.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry Athena. I will leave Olympus to you.\u2019</p><br/><p>The seat of the God of sun was handed over to Athena and at the same time a necklace was held in Tae Ho\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>It was a necklace that had the authority of the God of sun.</p><br/><p>It was the result of Apollo having conceded his seat of God of sun of Olympus to Athena and Tae Ho, a God of a foreign world.</p><br/><p>Apollo fell asleep with Artemis. Athena felt her divinity that got stronger and closed her eyes and Echidna frowned while looking at Apollo and Artemis having turned into stone.</p><br/><p>ARtemis didn\u2019t die but she fell asleep completely. Her sacred force became an ownerless throne and the countless being under the control of the Goddess of moon got liberated.</p><br/><p>It was something that couldn\u2019t happen normally. It was a miracle that occurred thanks to Apollo having sacrificed everything he had and falling asleep with Artemis.</p><br/><p>Dionysius breathed roughly. He admitted that this battle had ended in his complete defeat.</p><br/><p>But it was at that moment. Dionysius felt a strong and unfamiliar divine power. It was because Tae Ho\u2019s lesser God, Siri, had arrived in front of the black panther.</p><br/><p>Siri didn\u2019t attack the panther. She just glared it and then transmitted the voice of the upper God as his lesser God.</p><br/><p>[Dionysius.]</p><br/><p>Tae Ho spoke from a far place. Dionysius shrank down at the dark blue divinity that surged up in a threatening way.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho looked at the black panther through SIri\u2019s eyes and warned him from a distance.</p><br/><p>[You come next. I will go find you soon.]</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why prepare for it.</p><br/><p>Guard against me if you can.</p><br/><p>The God of conquer that came from Asgard will go to you to stab a knife in your sword.</p><br/><p>The conversation ended. Dionysius gave up on his shinsoo. The divinity of Dionysius that was in the black panther disappeared and the mad soldiers of the God lost their madness and toppled down.</p><br/><p>And once again in a far place, Tae Ho sat in a hidden room in one of Artemis\u2019 polises.</p><br/><p>He sweated as if his threat to the God of madness was all an act and let out a sigh of relief. Cuchulainn asked him.</p><br/><p>\u2018But hey.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Are you really going to attack Dionysius?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018That\u2019s obviously a lie.\u2019</p><br/><p>He had no reason to warn him of an attack as it wasn\u2019t even a telephone punch. In addition, striking first and ambushing was the best way of attack in a battle.</p><br/><p>He had scared him plentily so he would hide and make his defenses solidly. That\u2019s why he would leave aside Dionysius and focus on the next thing.</p><br/><p>The thing he had to do next. The most important thing of the things that remained.</p><br/><p>\u201cDemeter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho spoke in a low voice and clenched the necklace that had the authority of the God of sun.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 58 \u2013 The Goddess of the moon (5) &gt; End</p><br/>\n</div>"}

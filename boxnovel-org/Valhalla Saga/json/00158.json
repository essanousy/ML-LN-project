The limit he could summon the adversary with his saga was limited, compared to the summoning rock.</p><br/><p>When it was The warrior that had a Valkyrie meet him the limit was a radius of one kilometer but after it got promoted to The warrior that had a Goddess meet him the limit increased to three kilometers.</p><br/><p>The path heading to Olympus took three days in a carriage from Valhalla. Actually, the region where he caught Rolo was around that place. If they wanted to get closer they would have to travel one to two more days.</p><br/><p>He already knew that she wouldn\u2019t get summoned. Tae Ho used his saga just in case and felt urgency.</p><br/><p>\u201cCalm down.\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya sensed Tae Ho use his saga and said. She bit her lips once and then spoke to Hildegrid.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell Idun to come here immediately. We will proceed with the top rank promotion of Idun\u2019s warrior.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hildegarde answered immediately and left the room. Freya spoke to Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know about your relationship with Rasgrid. You have known her since you were a lowest ranked warrior but calm down. It will be meaningless to charge over there right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho was agitated and Freya looked at his eyes properly. She explained with a calm voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can guess two things with the signal getting cut. First, Rasgrid died completely. Second, Rasgrid moved to a place that the signal gets blocked.\u201d</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t use provocative words on purpose. They were only rational guesses.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s the former, it will be really meaningless to go running over there right now and even if it\u2019s the latter, it won\u2019t have any meaning either. No matter how much you hurry, you will still take a few hours to reach to the path leading to Olympus.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rasgrid\u2019s signal didn\u2019t weaken. It had disappeared completely.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why the probabilities of her having suffered a fatal injury was low. But of course, there was also the possibility she moved to a place that blocked her signal while being greatly injured or was trapped somewhere. Even if that was the case he had no methods to go to her right now.</p><br/><p>\u2018Freya-nim\u2019s words are right. Calm down and think calmly.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn added. He also liked Rasgrid but they wouldn\u2019t be able to solve this when their emotions got ahead of their actions.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlready 30 Valkyries didn\u2019t return and in addition Rasgrid disappeared.\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya continued speaking. She was half speaking to herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s also the possibility she\u2019s got done by the remnant forces of the giants but something may be wrong with Olympus.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Temple, Olympus and Asgard were allies but they weren\u2019t neighbouring countries. They were different worlds from each other.</p><br/><p>The Temple didn\u2019t know of Asgard\u2019s situation before Kaldea notified them of the urgency.</p><br/><p>If Tae Ho hadn\u2019t defeated the Beast king Tiachi and opened up a path the Temple would have noticed Asgard\u2019s situation only after it collapsed completely.</p><br/><p>It was the same for Olympus. If Olympus got done by without having the chance to notify of the danger or were in the same situation they couldn\u2019t notify of the danger, Asgard didn\u2019t have any methods to notice that danger.</p><br/><p>But of course, the three worlds maintained a constant contact to prepare for the worse. But even so that wasn\u2019t a few times in weeks but one or two times in a year. So a situation where it was already late when they realized was highly probable.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have to go to investigate and this time it can\u2019t be a Valkyrie but someone really strong. They should be at the class of a commander. Right, like you Tae Ho.\u201d</p><br/><p>If they sent someone weak they would just get defeated.</p><br/><p>Freya grabbed Tae Ho\u2019s hands. She acted as the housekeeper of Valhalla and commander of the Valkyries.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will send you even if you don\u2019t request it. No, I would like you to go. Currently there are only two commanders left in Valhalla including you. But I can\u2019t just send you like that. I will send you after I strengthen you a little bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was the reason she called Idun.</p><br/><p>She would turn Tae Ho into a top ranked warrior and grant him with a divinity.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow long will the ceremony take?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a ceremony that was planned to take place after three days. Freya frowned at Tae Ho\u2019s question and answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun and I will have to work hard but we will be able to end it in some minutes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s too much\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are times that we have to overdo it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya smirked and spoke. That looked was far from being elegant but Tae Ho felt that Freya was really beautiful.</p><br/><p>\u2018She\u2019s strong. It seems like light is shining from her.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho agreed to Cuchulainn\u2019s words. Odin didn\u2019t give her the position of Valhalla and Asgard\u2019s housekeeper for nothing.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you feel like falling for me now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya\u2019s playful voice turned Tae Ho back to reality. He shook his head and Freya snickered.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt will take some time to prepare the ceremony. Actually, I was planning to prepare it slowly starting today. That\u2019s why you will become a top ranked warrior after a few hours.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a ceremony granting a divinity.</p><br/><p>Looking at it in another perspective, it was the same as promoting a female warrior of Valhalla into a Valkyrie but there was quite a difference in it. Because of that, they couldn\u2019t use the magic circle that was usually used on promoting Valkyries. She had to use a new magic circle solely for Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cHrist!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Freya-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Valkyrie of Freya\u2019s legion that had the same name as the Valkyrie of Hermod\u2019s legion answered to her call. Freya ordered her, that expressed etiquette when she entered the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell the returning group to hurry up. You can take all the preparations you need.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hrist didn\u2019t seem to need an explanation after hearing the group returning group and she left the room instead of asking anymore.</p><br/><p>Freya explained quickly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t send you alone. I will make up an investigation team. Originally, it should be composed by members of Idun\u2019s legion but it would be impossible as all the warriors are lowest ranked except for you. That\u2019s why I will give you warriors from other legions.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a reasonable story but the word returning group bothered Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>Why was it a returning group? WHere were they returning from?</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you talking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, about them. Bracky and Siri were already returning from the battlefield to participate in your ceremony. It\u2019s a really rare thing even in Valhalla that a top ranked warrior gets born. Even if it was informal we were planning to show the utmost devotion to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>But of course, it was possible only because the situation was favorable. They were only taking two superior ranked warriors from the battlefield and call them to the rear.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will give you some Valkyries on top of Siri and Bracky. A top ranked warrior, two superior ranked warriors and about two Valkyries is a force that is more than enough for an investigation team. If an investigation group as this one gets defeated\u2026\u2026We have to retreat the forces that went to the north to chase Harmarti.\u201d</p><br/><p>It a commander- and a top ranked warrior on top of that got defeated, Asgard would also be in great danger.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould something have happened in Olympus?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope it\u2019s nothing serious.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a low probability for it to be nothing. But it was right at that moment.</p><br/><p>[Freya unni! What happened?]</p><br/><p>Idun\u2019s voice was heard from a bust of a Goddess that was in a side of the room. It was a bust that had the role of a phone that Freya used to contact Idun.</p><br/><p>Freya smirked at Idun\u2019s urgent and dubious voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome quickly. If you don\u2019t come in 5 minutes I will eat your warrior.\u201d</p><br/><p>[What are you\u2026\u2026\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u201cStart!\u201d</p><br/><p>Idun\u2019s voice got cut off the moment she yelled. It was because Idun cut the connection instead of Freya.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like she\u2019s really hurrying. Love is really incredible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya looked at Tae Ho with eyes that meant that it was good he was receiving love and Tae Ho cleared his throat with a bit embarrassed face.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, she should be coming soon so let\u2019s finish what we were doing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat we were doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat we were doing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya opened her eyes sharply and approached Tae Ho with one step and Tae Ho flinched when he thought of what happened before Hildegarde intruded.</p><br/><p>\u2018Envious bastard.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn said and Freya put a playful smile once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cPant, pant.\u201d</p><br/><p>Idun actually arrived at Freya\u2019s room after some minutes while panting heavily and Freya giggled while stroking the cats.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, did you really think I was going to eat your warrior? You should have come slowly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018She did have a little taste although it was only in the forehead.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn spoke in a small voice.</p><br/><p>And at that moment Idun glared at Freya and yelled.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnni! No, aunt!\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no way Idun heard Cuchulainn\u2019s voice but she was still angry that Freya had used Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>Freya opened her eyes sharply at Idun\u2019s changed way of addressing Freya.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! I told you not to call me aunt but unnie!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat unnie! You are an aunt!\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya and the previous Idun were like sisters so actually, aunt was the correct expression for the daughter of the previous Idun.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally what?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was completely a fight between sisters. Tae Ho butted in hurriedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun-nim, calm down. We have to hurry.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was certainly effective. Idun, that was breathing hard while looking at Freya, calmed down her breathing and asked Tae Ho quickly.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy warrior Tae Ho, just what happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe signal of Rasgrid that was investigating the path leading to Olympus disappeared.\u201d</p><br/><p>The answer came from Freya. Idun blinked a few times as she didn\u2019t know what she was talking about but soon, understood the seriousness of the situation and also understood why Freya had called her.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s start with the ceremony of the top ranked warrior.\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya stood up from her seat.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>The preparation of the ceremony took place in Freya\u2019s room.</p><br/><p>Freya ordered the Valkyries to prepare for the ceremony and drew a complicated magic circle in the middle of the room with Idun. It seemed like not anyone was able to do it as the process took an abundant amount of divine power.</p><br/><p>In addition, it wasn\u2019t something that ended in a short moment just like Freya said. About three hours passed until Idun and Freya completed the magic circle.</p><br/><p>Freya got wet with her sweat. She stood in her place with Idun while placing Tae Ho at the center of the magic circle. She recited a chant to make a part of the magic circle shine and continued to recite new chants.</p><br/><p>About ten minutes later. Freya stopped her chants when the entire magic circle started to shine. She took a deep breath and spoke to Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only the last step left. It is to engrave the name of a new God in the real world tree of Yggdrasil.\u201d</p><br/><p>They would make the world aware of the birth of a new God.</p><br/><p>Idun approached Tae Ho and made a light hand gesture. A nameplate of light appeared in the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy warrior Tae Ho. Write your name in this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya gave Tae Ho a feather made of light this time.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho pondered for a moment but then wrote his name in Korean and Idun and Freya tilted their heads because they didn\u2019t know the characters he wrote but didn\u2019t think about it for long. It was because the meaning behind it was more important rather than the letters or symbols.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, we are done with the formalities. I will now lead your divine power with Idun. Close your eyes and concentrate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho closed his eyes at Freya\u2019s words. He calmed down himself like meditating and concentrated the power in the inside of his body.</p><br/><p>Idun\u2019s divine power.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho\u2019s own magic power.</p><br/><p>The blessings of the several Valkyries.</p><br/><p>He felt a familiar yet unfamiliar strength between those.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can feel a strength different from Idun\u2019s divine power right? ALthough it\u2019s small and weak yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya spoke and increased her divine power. Idun did the same and the power of the two Goddesses brought up the power of a new God.</p><br/><p>It seemed like a flower had blossomed.</p><br/><p>It was too small compared to Idun\u2019s or Freya\u2019s divine power but Tae Ho shuddered at that strength. Tae Ho\u2019s soul yelled.</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulations my warrior Tae Ho.\u201d</p><br/><p>Idun spoke as if whispering. Tae Ho opened his eyes slowly and looked at his surroundings. Nothing had changed externally but something had certainly changed.</p><br/><p>\u201cDivine powers don\u2019t always repel each other. In the end it depends on you but\u2026.your divine power will grow in a direction that suits with Idun\u2019s divine power well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya said with a relaxed face. Idun grabbed Tae Ho\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m really proud of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The birth of a top ranked warrior was really rare even if you looked at the history of Valhalla.</p><br/><p>Because of that, you could say that the birth of a top ranked warrior was the pride of a legion.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you. Thank you Idun-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho expressed his thanks to Idun and Freya and then put strength in his hands holding Idun\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>Idun spoke once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy warrior Tae Ho, be careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet my blessing accompany you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Idun stood on her toes and gave Tae Ho the best blessing. Idun\u2019s hair turned red and then she blessed Tae Ho one more time.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet Idun\u2019s blessing accompany you.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was Heda. Tae Ho embraced her tightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet my blessing accompany you.\u201d</p><br/><p>And blessed her back. Freya frowned while looking at them and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo it outside, outside. Not Here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn agreed to her words earnestly.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>Tae Ho left the palace of Freya and then headed to the central hall of Valhalla after bidding his farewell to Idun.</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBracky! Siri!\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri and Bracky, that returned quickly by using a Black Flash, greeted Tae Ho. It seemed like they didn\u2019t arrive recently looking that they looked fine even though they rode on the Black Flash.</p><br/><p>\u201cI congratulate you on having become a top ranked warrior.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are the pride of our knight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri embraced Tae Ho and Bracky embraced the two of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for coming like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho got out of Bracky\u2019s embrace like escaping and spoke. Siri got to escape thanks to him and smirked but then fixed her expression to a serious one and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard about our task.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will be fighting in a really long while.\u201d</p><br/><p>An investigation team with Tae Ho as the leader.</p><br/><p>The two people had already heard of Rasgrid\u2019s disappearance along the other Valkyries.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho nodded once and looked sideways. It was because a familiar aura was approaching.</p><br/><p>\u201cValkyrie Ingrid of Njord\u2019s legion greets the commander of Idun.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cingrid?\u201d</p><br/><p>She used polite words once again as it was a formal occasion.</p><br/><p>It seemed like Ingrid was one of the Valkyries Freya had said they would accompany him. Siri opened her mouth to explain.</p><br/><p>\u201cIngrid will accompany us along with\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will also go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGandur.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gandur, that was hidden in the opposite direction of Ingrid jumped up and appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a mixed team. As for the Valkyries of Idun\u2019s legion, Heda will have to remain on Valhalla like usual and you can call Adenmaha and Nidhogg whenever you want with your summoning rocks. The remaining two are newbies, we can\u2019t entrust a task this important to newcomers. That\u2019s why the veteran Ingrid and I will be going with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t as much as Ingrid but Gandur had stayed back on Valhalla because of the injury she suffered in the last battle.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy i\u2019m able to help commander-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ingrid expressed etiquette once again. Her voice and attitudes were stiff but she was filled with warmth like usual and worry about Rasgrid.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you. Let\u2019s depart immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>They had spent quite a lot of time already. There was no need to waste more time now that all the members were here.</p><br/><p>Bracky checked his surroundings and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about the transportation? Is there a space door or\u2026.so it was that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bracky\u2019s voice became depressed and Siri put an expression as she had gulped something bitter. Tae Ho nodded with a determined face.</p><br/><p>And after a while, in the sky of Valhalla.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy lower body feels weiiiiiiiiiiird!\u201d</p><br/><p>Five Black Flashes crossed the sky of Valhalla.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you awake?\u201d</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 47 \u2013 The fastest one (1) &gt; End</p><hr/><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/>\n</div>"}

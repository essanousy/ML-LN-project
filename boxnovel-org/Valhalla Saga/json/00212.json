Hey! Lee Tae Ho!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScathach master?\u201d</p><br/><p>A day before Scathach\u2019s crisis.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho sighed in his room. He was holding the wooden tag Thor gave him.</p><br/><p>Heda and Idun informed Thor that Tae Ho must see this alone so there was currently no one nearby. He had even entrusted Gae Bolg to Siri.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m getting nervous.\u2019</p><br/><p>Normally, Cuchulainn might have cracked a joke to ease Tae Ho\u2019s` nervousness.</p><br/><p>However, it had been a really long while since Tae Ho had been separated from Cuchulainn. Cuchulainn was always by his side, anytime and everywhere except when he entrusted Gae Bolg to Scathach.</p><br/><p>\u2018But why did they say that I must see this alone?\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn claimed that there would be an erotic video in it and that\u2019s why they should see it together but there was no way that was the case.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hey you bastard! You have to share the good things!\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho shook his head when he heard Cuchulainn\u2019s shout while handing Gae Bolg to Siri.</p><br/><p>\u2018There\u2019s no way, no way.\u2019</p><br/><p>And for the slight possibility the video was 18+, he really had to see it alone.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho thought and laughed . It seemed like he was excited to hear Idun\u2019s and Heda\u2019s voice after a long time. He was nervous that he even took absurd things seriously.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho inhaled, closed his eyes, inserted magic power into the wooden tag and activated the rune magic.</p><br/><p>[Hello again?]</p><br/><p>A smile split Tae Ho\u2019s face as he heard the voice that emerged from the wooden tag. He tried to fix his expression by biting his lips but this was in vain.</p><br/><p>A video materialized after the voice. The beam shot out of the tip of the tag and expanded into the shape of a triangle. It really resembled a hologram.</p><br/><p>The video grew to the size of the upper body of Idun. All her body was displayed so Tae Ho felt like he was looking at a sculpture of Idun that Ragnar made.</p><br/><p>[My warrior Tae Ho.]</p><br/><p>Idun said and Tae Ho smiled again.</p><br/><p>Heda liked to say \u2018Hello Again?\u2019 and Idun \u2018My warrior Tae Ho\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Idun-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a phone call, justa mere video but Tae Ho still replied.</p><br/><p>Idun smiled in the video.</p><br/><p>[I heard several things. That you became the master of Asgard and rebuilt Erin\u2026..You have really become a great figure in the time I haven\u2019t seen you.]</p><br/><p>Only a single month had passed since Tae Ho left Asgard and came to Olympus, so his change was really drastic.</p><br/><p>It was now that Idun pouted and extended her head forward. She spoke in a low voice as if telling a secret.</p><br/><p>[But you are still my warrior. My warrior. I can never concede this. Right? You are my warrior right?]</p><br/><p>She spoke quite firmly at first but then her voice seemed like she was acting self-conscious so it was quite cute to see.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Idun-nim. I\u2019m your warrior.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho answered in a good mood and Idun touched her ears in embarrassment.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho understood why Idun was emphasizing that he was her warrior.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that she saw the master of Asgard as someone below her at all.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is why she said that I should see this alone.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho smiled and stroked the Idun in the video. Idun fixed her posture as if she felt his hand. She spoke of something else with a voice hiding her embarrassment.</p><br/><p>[Hm hm, I\u2019m healthy now. You too, right? You must be. I will get angry if you\u2019re nott. Um, is it a bit weird?]</p><br/><p>Idun blushed in embarrassment as she thought her speech was a little weird.</p><br/><p>[Anyways, it\u2019s like that. I\u2019m doing well so don\u2019t worry about me. It\u2019s really peaceful you know? The problem in the north was solved well and there\u2019s no problem in the residence.]</p><br/><p>[My warrior Tae Ho, I want to see you. Not by transmitting my voice through a tag like this, but I want to see and talk to you face to face.]</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Idun bit her lips. She shrugged her shoulders but spoke with a bright voice.</p><br/><p>[More than that Tae Ho, how\u2019s life in Olympus going? You are doing well right? I\u2019m really worried about you. Ragnar told me not to worry, telling me I worrying too much when we were talking about you. He said that you must be spending a happy life by registering the several Goddesses of Olympus in your saga but there\u2019s no way that\u2019s true, right? Yes? Right? Aren\u2019t my words right? My warrior Tae Ho.]</p><br/><p>Tae Ho didn\u2019t answer. He turned his head as if evading her eyes and played dumb.</p><br/><p>\u2018Athena, Hestia, Echidna, Aphrodite\u2026.um, there aren\u2019t many, not that many.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was all to strengthen their forces.</p><br/><p>If Cuchulainn had been here he would have exclaimed what kind of nonsense these Gods were spouting but fortunately he wasn\u2019t. Tae Ho could become more confident, no, more bold.</p><br/><p>And fortunately, Idun\u2019s inquiry didn\u2019t last long. She changed subjects completely and started to speak about the small details in the residence. It wasn\u2019t that important but he felt warm just by listening to it.</p><br/><p>[Whew, I have a lot of things I want to say but I should end it here.]</p><br/><p>Idun took a deep breath after speaking for almost five minutes straight and fixed her posture. She looked at Tae Ho with the holiness of a Goddess like when they first met.</p><br/><p>[My warrior Tae Ho, let my blessing accompany you.]</p><br/><p>Idun spoke gracefully and kissed the air. However, she quickly became embarrassed at her own actions once again.</p><br/><p>After this Idun took off the veil that was covering her eyes. Then, Idun\u2019s golden hair transformed into red and here eyes that were hidden behind the veil became a clear red color.</p><br/><p>[Uh\u2026.hello once again?]</p><br/><p>Heda cleared her throat and then spoke brightly. Her bright red ears could be seen after removing the veil.</p><br/><p>[A moment. Just a moment.]</p><br/><p>Heda turned around and took a breath. Tae Ho naturally grew a smile looking at her shy back.</p><br/><p>[Whew, good. I\u2019m okay now. Yes yes, perfect.]</p><br/><p>When Heda turned around an aura of life overflowed from her. If Idun was the Goddess of life, then Helda was the Goddess of youth.</p><br/><p>[Idun has already told you a lot so I don\u2019t know what to say. She\u2019s bad. Originally, we were meant to speak what we decided on.]</p><br/><p>She grumbled and looked in Tae Ho\u2019s direction as if she was aware of his presence and asked with an ill-natured face.</p><br/><p>[So, how was it for real? Did your saga get strengthened a lot?]</p><br/><p>There were many sagas Tae Ho had but there was only one saga those judging eyes were asking.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho evaded her eyes and played dumb once again. However, Heda\u2019s eyes sharpened as if she had seen through him.</p><br/><p>[So that was the case. You me many Goddesses of Olympus. That was the case. That\u2019s why you completely forgot about Asgard.]</p><br/><p>It was the \u2018so that was the case\u2019 attack. He was happy because he hadn\u2019t heard it in a really long while but he still felt like he was being poked in the heart.</p><br/><p>[I heard that Olympus was in an internal war now so you meet Goddesses on our side and tell them that you would rescue Olympus? You wouldn\u2019t have gone and met enemy Goddesses right?]</p><br/><p>Heda spoke while laughing and Tae Ho looked up at the sky. He decided that he felt like Heda\u2019s voice had become colder.</p><br/><p>[So that was the case. You received meetings from enemy Goddesses and from races of Gods besides the Goddesses of Olympus. You really became the demon of men. That was the case.]</p><br/><p>Heda was right like usual. Tae Ho felt goosebumps at this fact.</p><br/><p>[Well, can that really be true? It\u2019s a joke. Yes yes, a joke. There\u2019s no way that can happen.]</p><br/><p>Heda smiled brightly and Tae Ho experienced the miraculous thought of not wanting to reunite with Heda for the first time.</p><br/><p>[Haa, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing alone. I want to go see you immediately.]</p><br/><p>Heda dropped her shoulders as if strength left her body and sat in place. She looked upwards and then knocked the air with her fingers. And then the video that was reflecting Heda\u2019s body caught just her face.</p><br/><p>It felt like Heda was really in front of him. She spoke with a teary voice.</p><br/><p>[I want to see you. Really. I really want to meet with you.]</p><br/><p>It was the same for Tae Ho. He stroke the Heda\u2019s cheeks that he couldn\u2019t actually touch.</p><br/><p>[Let my blessing accompany you.]</p><br/><p>Heda spoke and Tae Ho said the same. Heda forced a bright smile and stopped the video.</p><br/><p>The next morning.</p><br/><p>Siri returned Gae Bolg to Tae Ho and Cuchulainn clicked his tongue.</p><br/><p>\u2018Did you stay up all night?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Tch tch tch, what a poor youth.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn let out a sigh and Tae Ho smiled bitterly with an exhausted face.</p><br/><p>\u2018But it was good to hear her voice after a long while, right?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Of course.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I also want to feel good. It sounds weird but you know where I\u2019m going right?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019ll feel good soon. Scathach master said that she would come.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Right, I\u2019m really looking forward to it.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn didn\u2019t show it now, but he had turned half crazy when he thought that Scathach had died. His feelings towards Scathach didn\u2019t fall behind that of Tae Ho\u2019s on fort Heda.</p><br/><p>\u2018More than that, you said that you obtained a title?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Are you talking about \u2018The one that killed a God?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Right, that one. The title is really bloody.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018This title gives me several advantages when I fight against Gods. The quests and the power of Olympus really look like a game.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know what you are talking about but it\u2019s enough if it\u2019s understandable for you.\u2019</p><br/><p>Each world had infinite unique powers.</p><br/><p>Just like Tae Ho described, the quests and titles of Olympus could be compared to the ones in the games.</p><br/><p>It was a direct method of accomplishing a quest and obtaining a reward.</p><br/><p>Erin had an extreme method of putting a restriction and obtaining strength just like the power of geass and the sentences, but there was also the method of strengthening your sentence by investing time.</p><br/><p>\u2018The most special ability should be the saga of Asgard. The range of application is wide and an absurd saga like yours can be made but\u2026..the requirements are much more strict than you think. If you look at the training of the warriors, the efficiency much worse compared to Olympus or Erin.\u2019</p><br/><p>If you wanted to use your saga properly, you needed an anecdote that could support it.</p><br/><p>Because of this, it extremely difficult to create a warrior with a strong saga.</p><br/><p>But of course, you could also use the anecdote inside a legendary weapon and not your own anecdote, but in the first place those legendary weapons were hard to acquire.</p><br/><p>Really, Tae Ho was a really special being even in Asgard.</p><br/><p>First off, the number of anecdotes he possessed was staggering. Even Sigurd, the strongest warrior of Valhalla, felt small in front of Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>Because of this, Tae Ho could mass produce strong sagas. In addition he even had an overwhelming amount of accomplishments of the dragon knight Kalsted, and many legendary weapons on top of that.</p><br/><p>\u2018You really are a cheat, a cheat. Ragnar looked at you well.\u2019</p><br/><p>He was speaking like a joke but there was some truth.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho already reached the realm of being a cheat with just the strength of Asgard. Adding the strength of Erin and Olympus on top, he was beyond imagination.</p><br/><p>Actually, Tae Ho defeating many strong beings of Olympus one by one just like Poseidon, was already proof of Tae Ho being a cheat.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho was certainly the master of Asgard but had only been so for a short time. .</p><br/><p>If you used a person as an example, he had just been able to walk.</p><br/><p>No matter how strong a lion is, a lion cub isn\u2019t able to overwhelm a hyena.</p><br/><p>But Tae Ho had accomplished something similar. No, he hadn\u2019t defeated a mere hyena but a full grown lion.</p><br/><p>Ragnar\u2019s judgement was correct and his imagination would go astray.</p><br/><p>The limit he had forecasted.</p><br/><p>It was obvious Tae Ho would vastly surpass it.</p><br/><p>\u2018At first, I thought that Ragnar would be wrong in other meanings.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn laughed in a good mood while Tae Ho frowned slightly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why are you laughing suddenly? Did you think of something weird?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Did I?\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn clicked his tongue and waited for Scathach to visit them.</p><br/><p>And a few hours later.</p><br/><p>\u201cLee Tae Ho! Hey! Lee Tae Ho!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho flinched as he heard the shout of Scathach. It was because he hadn\u2019t heard her this angry even in the residence of Idun.</p><br/><p>Just why?</p><br/><p>Did he do something to enrage her?</p><br/><p>Tae Ho looked back at what he had done but he didn\u2019t have enough time. The door of the room had opened with a bang.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you were here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Scahtach smiled gorgeously and said. But her eyes were freezing cold so Tae Ho stepped back unconsciously.</p><br/><p>\u201cMa, master?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou sold me out in a really nice way. Do you know how troubled I was? Huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Scathach thought of Nidhogg\u2019s bright expression and dripped cold sweat.</p><br/><p>She felt displeased because she felt like she was dirtying something pure if she told Nidhogg the truth, but she was also scared if she said something absurd and Nidhogg believed in that. It was also a scratch in her pride as a great master.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho finally realized the reason Scathach was this angry and then extended his hands and made an excuse.</p><br/><p>\u201cTh, that is because I trust in your aspect as a teacher\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour eloquence for words has improved while I haven\u2019t seen you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Scathach cracked her knuckles and made a fist. The teachings of Scathach were really extreme, just like the tower of shadows had proved.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho became cornered in an instant and with no escape so he gritted his teeth and spoke with a blunt tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, i\u2019m not originally like this but I\u2019m still the master of Asgard andthe king of Erin\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, so\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He was wrong. His claim of authority didn\u2019t work on her.</p><br/><p>Scathach snorted in reply, crossed her arms and opened her mouth with a harsh expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cListen well Tae Ho. Even if you are the master of Asgard, the king of Erin or become the master of the nine realms there is one thing that will never change.\u201d</p><br/><p>What is that?</p><br/><p>Tae Ho thought and Scathach gave him an answer, as expected of a great master.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am your master and you are my disciple.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Kya, master is the most bewitching when she says that.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn admired and thought of his past. The situation and the atmosphere was clearly different to the situation Tae Ho was in but he didn\u2019t care such trivialities.</p><br/><p>Ahero shouldn\u2019t care about such small things.</p><br/><p>About an hour later.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho, who felt like even his soul was beaten, gathered everyone he felt necessary to a meeting.</p><br/><p>Thor, Bracky, Siri, Adenmaha, Nidhogg, Echidna, Athena, and Scathach.</p><br/><p>Scathach joined as a new member of the group of nine. Also, the crow Hugin joined, who traveled far to reach Mesena.</p><br/><p>[Let\u2019s begin speaking then.]</p><br/><p>Odin spoke through Hugin\u2019s beak and everyone focused on him.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 61 \u2013 Great Hero (2) &gt; End</p><br/>\n</div>"}

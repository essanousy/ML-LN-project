It was tens of meters long from its tail to its head.</p><br/><p>In addition, it wasn\u2019t only big. It\u2019s leathery hide, which was laced in black lines, was hard as steel, and its fur was as sharp as a blade.</p><br/><p>The root Nidhogg was living in was in a really deep place. The lake of Mimir was connected to one of the roots too, but they couldn\u2019t be viewed as being the same. If the root Nidhogg lived was the 100th floor, then the lake of Mimir was at the 10th.</p><br/><p>Ratatoskr passed the lake of Mimir and went down to a deeper place. It ran while passing the dense fog.</p><br/><p>Ratatoskr looked different from normal squirrels, its size aside. It had a long tail that rivaled its body in length and had four legs, but its head and other body parts looked really heinous.</p><br/><p>There were sharp stones surging up from its fur. If the stiff fur was like a blade, then the rocks could be compared to huge axes.</p><br/><p>But the most peculiar part was its head.</p><br/><p>Big, white teeth that could turn hard boulders into dust in an instant were sprouting out. There was a horn erupting from the inside of its nose and two more flanking its head. The one that was in its nose was like that of a rhinoceros, and the ones at the sides of its head were centered so that they made a circle.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that weird up to this point because horns were something that common beasts also had.</p><br/><p>The thing that made its head truly gastly was that there was the upper body of a woman melded into its forehead.</p><br/><p>The lower body of the woman was the head of the beast, just like a centaur, and the upper body of a human.</p><br/><p>The woman had violet skin and had hair composed of hundreds of thin, elongated snakes.</p><br/><p>Her eyes held no scleras and were completely black, and the tongue of a snake darted out from her mouth.</p><br/><p>Just from looking at its shape, one could say that it was rather beautiful, but the feeling it gave was heinous and atrocious, so it also made one feel fear.</p><br/><p>Ratatoskr hummed and ran. It\u2019s claws left new wounds in the World Tree.</p><br/><p>The fog grew denser. Human presence disappeared completely, and nothing was heard aside from the steps of Ratatoskr.</p><br/><p>And it finally stopped. It wasn\u2019t because it had reached its objective. There was a bit more to go, but it stopped anyways.</p><br/><p>The boundary between the root Nidhogg lived in and the one above that lay before it.</p><br/><p>The last line that couldn\u2019t be crossed if one didn\u2019t have permission, so it wouldn\u2019t be able to be crossed until Nidhogg\u2019s eventual demise.</p><br/><p>How would it bother Nidhogg today?</p><br/><p>He thought of several methods in an instant. Among them, there was a fresh curse Hraesvelg had made.</p><br/><p>But Ratatoskr shook his head. It was because it wanted to go by the traditional way.</p><br/><p>\u201cShall I go then?\u201d</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s bully Nidhogg.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s keep berating the poor dragon that was stuck in the roots and make it resent the world. Let\u2019s dye its white heart with black emotions.</p><br/><p>More than a thousand years had passed, but the squirrel didn\u2019t grow tired of it. It was rather fun for it.</p><br/><p>Because Nidhogg only had Ratatoskr, but it wasn\u2019t the same for Ratatoskr.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t talking about Hraesvelgr. Ratatoskr could come and go from the top of the World Tree to the roots however much it wanted, and so harassing Nidhogg was only one of the tasks it had to do.</p><br/><p>It was something that brought it joy whenever it was recalled in its memory, so there was no way it would grow tired from doing it.</p><br/><p>Ratatoskr giggled and then crossed the line as its determination grew.</p><br/><p>It clenched the World Tree with its claws and pushed itself upside down.</p><br/><p>Ratatoskr didn\u2019t call for Nidhogg. It was because, even by walking silently like this, that big and fool-like dragon extended its head like a chick waiting for food and waited for it.</p><br/><p>And it wasn\u2019t different today. It had merely went down a hundred meters after crossing the line, but the black dragon extended its head beyond the dense fog and poisonous fog.</p><br/><p>\u201cRatatoskr!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg said. It was Nidhogg that always smiled brightly when starting the conversation but always ended up crying.</p><br/><p>Ratatoskr laughed. It was because it was glad to see that the heinous dragon that was 2 kilometers long looked at itself and speak with an anxious voice.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg grabbed the World Tree with two of its arms as if it wanted to get closer and pushed its body closer. The scene was overwhelming as it was no different from a mountain scrambling closer, but Ratatoskr didn\u2019t mind it much. There was plenty of distance between the two of them.</p><br/><p>Ratatoskr stopped in place and started to speak with light curses. It was only saying that Nidhogg was stupid and only big and acted as a kid, but this much was enough for Nidhogg as it wouldn\u2019t be able to understand hard curses either way.</p><br/><p>And Nidhogg started to sob as it had effect.</p><br/><p>\u201cToo much, you are too much! Why are you always like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>As the distance between the two of them was still great, they conversed through magic rather than with their voices.</p><br/><p>Ratatoskr laughed once more. It was because the sobs of the dragon were still heard as a roar, and it was too laughable.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is because you are a retard that doesn\u2019t have friends, family, or anything!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg\u2019s big body flinched. Nidhogg said in a dispirited voice again,</p><br/><p>\u201cBut <i>you</i> are my friend.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. Why would I befriend trash like you?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Ratatoskr spoke in a cold voice, Nidhogg flinched once again. Then, Ratatoskr slightly pulled back, as it knew that this was the perfect moment to give additional wounds.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor trash like you to call me a friend, I will have to leave as you have worsened my mood.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo-Don\u2019t go!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg knocked its head on the floor and begged. Ratatoskr smirked at that and then looked down at Nidhogg\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine. Then copy what I say. If you do, I will stay for a bit longer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYe-Yeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNidhogg is trash that is only big, doesn\u2019t have any friends, and has a retarded head and doesn\u2019t have any right to live. Having been born is a sin of itself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg opened its mouth but couldn\u2019t say anything. Ratatoskr laughed once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy, you can\u2019t? I will leave then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ratatoskr really turned around and then Nidhogg yelled hurriedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026.I will do it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ratatoskr slightly turned its head and looked down at Nidhogg. Nidhogg sobbed and opened its mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cNi-Nidhogg is a big\u2026..retard\u2026..stupid\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t hear you well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTrash. Doesn\u2019t have rights to live. Having been born is\u2026\u2026 a sin\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg\u2019s voice became lower and lower, and Ratatoskr\u2019s smile became denser in kind.</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m done. You will stay a bit more, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg forced a smile and said. This was the moment Ratatoskr hoped for the most.</p><br/><p>\u201cRetard! You really do it because I tell you to do so? I\u2019m leaving!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ratatoskr laughed and turned around. He still hadn\u2019t transmitted the fouls words Hraesvelg had requested be passed to Nidhogg and also couldn\u2019t make the dragon spit curses to transmit it to Hraesvelgr, but it could do all this later.</p><br/><p>Leaving like this today would be the most effective.</p><br/><p>Ahh, what kind of expression would Nidhogg make now that it was left alone? How much would it cry?</p><br/><p>Just imagining it was fun, and because of that, Ratatoskr didn\u2019t leave Yggdrasil immediately. It pretended to hesitate a moment so that Nidhogg\u2019s hopeful attitude would rise again so he could crush it once more.</p><br/><p>And it was at that moment-</p><br/><p>Nidhogg pushed its body forward, and Ratatoskr laughed once again at that big movement.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do? You can\u2019t even fly because of how big you are!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ratatoskr turned around to harass Nidhogg. It even got a bit lower as if egging it on.</p><br/><p>Just like Odin had predicted after listening to Nidhogg\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u2018Go.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn said. At that command, Nidhogg\u2019s big body, precisely speaking, its big head, split in two.</p><br/><p>The thing that surged up was Nidhogg. It\u2019s size, merely 1/20 of its original body, was still a huge, black dragon, and it fluttered its four pair of wings and flew up.</p><br/><p>Ratatoskr was stunned at the sudden emergence and tried to turn around, but it couldn\u2019t do so. All four of its legs were tied up to the World Tree and didn\u2019t move.</p><br/><p>It was the effect of the rune magic Odin had engraved. As he had installed it in a hurry, it wasn\u2019t able to tie down a beast like Ratatoskr for a long time, but it didn\u2019t matter too much. It was enough if it was able to tie the rude squirrel down even for a few seconds.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg fluttered its wings once again as Ratatoskr broke the rune magic, but when it turned around, another magic was activated.</p><br/><p>Odin hadn\u2019t installed only one rune magic. He had inscribed a line of them along the path he\u2019d guessed that Ratatoskr would approach and leave the border Nidhogg wasn\u2019t able to cross.</p><br/><p>Ratatoskr\u2019s movements stopped again, and Nidhogg flew. The distance between the two grew closer by every passing second.</p><br/><p>Finally, Nidhogg\u2019s teeth reached Ratatoskr. It bit its tail.</p><br/><p>The first plan Odin had come up with was that Nidhogg would drag down Ratatoskr, but Tae Ho\u2019s plan was different. Tae Ho, who was riding on Nidhogg\u2019s forehead, looked at a place beyond Ratatoskr. He looked at the line that Nidhogg couldn\u2019t cross and ordered,</p><br/><p>\u201cFly up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg fluttered its wings with more strength and charged while still biting Ratatoskr\u2019s tail.</p><br/><p>Odin had said that it was impossible to cross the line with all of Nidhogg\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>To cross it, one needed Ratatoskr, the only existence that was allowed to do so.</p><br/><p>To fly while biting Ratatoskr one needed overwhelming strength and also speed that could cross that line in an instant.</p><br/><p>Ratatoskr shook its body as if struggling. It tried to delay Nidhogg\u2019s speed by a little bit.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg felt it to be difficult. It felt that it would be impossible to cross the line like this.</p><br/><p>But it didn\u2019t stop its wings.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t because of the desire that it wanted to cross the line and get out.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg wasn\u2019t alone. There was someone granting it strength.</p><br/><p>[Odin\u2019s Valkyrie]</p><br/><p>Odin had given Nidhogg a title of Valkyrie.</p><br/><p>The process was a mess as there wasn\u2019t even a ceremony, but it was enough.</p><br/><p>Because the minimum requirements were caught.</p><br/><p>It now needed a new strength to be added!</p><br/><p>[Saga: The Warrior that Rides on Valkyries]</p><br/><p>[Saga: The One that Controls Dragons]</p><br/><p>[Saga: The Charge of a Warrior is like a Storm]</p><br/><p>Tae Ho\u2019s sagas granted further strength to Nidhogg. It enabled Nidhogg, who didn\u2019t have much experience in flying, to be able to draw a perfect trajectory.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg raised its head and pushed Ratatoskr in the boundary line. It used Ratatoskr as a shield and passed through the invisible barrier!</p><br/><p>A sound that was breaking was heard, and Ratatoskr cried out.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg\u2019s strength was spent as she passed through the barrier, but she still summoned more to fly up again. It stuck its claws onto Yggdrasil and hung on to it desperately.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg couldn\u2019t do anything anymore. It didn\u2019t even have the strength to move now. It couldn\u2019t even be happy about the fact that it had crossed the line because of its exhaustion.</p><br/><p>Ratatoskr breathed roughly. It couldn\u2019t get out from Nidhogg\u2019s grasp; however, it could push it back below the line.</p><br/><p>But its plan was thwarted. It wasn\u2019t because of Odin\u2019s rune magic. Obviously enough, Odin\u2019s rune magic didn\u2019t exist outside the boundary line.</p><br/><p>Another one.</p><br/><p>A third person besides Nidhogg and Odin.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn didn\u2019t make any advices. Tae Ho surged up by kicking Nidhogg\u2019s forehead and charged towards Ratatoskr.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you! Who the hell are you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ratatoskr got angry and asked, but Tae Ho gripped the air instead of answering immediately. He gripped the Hammer of Clash, one of the weapons Merlin had made to face the giants.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Nidhogg\u2019s friend.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ratatoskr blinked at the late reply, and at that moment, Tae Ho swung his hammer. It clashed against Ratatoskr\u2019s head, and a crisp, violent explosion rang out like a thunderclap.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 38 \u2013 Ratatoskr (3) &gt; End</p><hr/><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/><p>Episode 38/Chapter 4: Ratatoskr (4)</p><br/><p>TL: Tsubak</p><br/><p>ED: Julsmul</p><hr/><br/><p>Ratatoskr couldn\u2019t understand the current situation.</p><br/><p>It did understand that Nidhogg had gotten smaller, for an ancient dragon was an existence far removed from its normal brethren.</p><br/><p>Actually, it didn\u2019t make sense that it\u2019d maintained a huge body of 2 kilometers in the first place. The reason Nidhogg was able to survive, even when it had that big body, was because Nidhogg\u2019s \u2018original\u2019 body was a kind of magic- a magical armor.</p><br/><p>The ancient dragon was an existence like a God just as Odin had thought.</p><br/><p>Because of that, one could say that the shape of a woman with long black hair was Nidhogg\u2019s real body.</p><br/><p>The shape of the black dragon was only a magical armor Nidhogg was wearing, so it could change it whenever it wanted.</p><br/><p>It could wear a smaller armor instead.</p><br/><p>It was doubtful how a stupid girl like Nidhogg could come up with that, but it was possible.</p><br/><p>But what happened after that was out of Ratatoskr\u2019s comprehension.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg had crossed the line. A dragon that hadn\u2019t been able to fly properly because of its big body suddenly drew a perfect trajectory as if it had become a master in flying.</p><br/><p>The several rune magics that were engraved in Yggdrasil also filled the squirrel with confusion. The ancient dragon, Nidhogg, could use mystical magic as naturally as breathing, but it could only spit some fire or wind. It was a fool that had power but didn\u2019t know how to use it.</p><br/><p>Rune magic was a really developed magic. From whom did Nidhogg learn it when it had only met Ratatoskr?</p><br/><p>The focus point of the things it couldn\u2019t understand was the human that\u2019d surged up from atop Nidhogg\u2019s forehead.</p><br/><p>Who was that human?</p><br/><p>How could someone besides Nidhogg be on the roots!</p><br/><p><i>Bang!</i></p><br/><p>A loud sound erupted once again. Ratatoskr, that had its head bent back because it\u2019d been hit by Tae Ho\u2019s hammer, was hit once again in its right cheek.</p><br/><p>Blood and teeth spurted through the air.</p><br/><p>Ratatoskr screamed.</p><br/><p>\u201cDie!\u201d</p><br/><p>An evil aura burst out like an explosion. But it didn\u2019t end there, and the several vipers that were on its head instead of fire flew towards Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho acted calmly. The moment he hit Ratatoskr\u2019s cheek, he put back the Hammer of Clash and instead grabbed Caliburn. He blocked the evil aura with Camelot\u2019s glory and entrusted his body to the shock. He got pushed behind naturally and then swung his sword.</p><br/><p><i>Chkat!</i></p><br/><p>He split the head of the vipers alongside a sharp sound. Ratatoskr screamed once again, and Tae Ho kicked the air. He jumped as if spinning and then swung his sword once more. The Wind Split performed by Caliburn slashed the vipers in one go.</p><br/><p>Ratatoskr bent back. It retrieved the vipers and opened its mouth widely towards Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>The cry of a snake erupted from its throat, and at that moment, purple poison that seemed like it could melt even gold in an instant was fired towards Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>It was an attack that Tae Ho couldn\u2019t dodge easily as he could jump in the air but not fly freely. Compared to Nidhogg, Ratatoskr had a little battle experience and spread its poison widely on purpose, so it became hard for Tae Ho to dodge.</p><br/><p>But Tae Ho acted calm this time too. He kicked the air once more and then incorporated Scathach\u2019s techniques to Kalsted\u2019s swordsmanship.</p><br/><p>Wind Split.</p><br/><p>A curtain of wind arose by following the trajectory of the sword. It didn\u2019t only stop Ratatoskr\u2019s poison, it led them away with the wind, and it rather poured down at Ratatoskr.</p><br/><p>\u201c<i>Kyaaak!</i>\u201d</p><br/><p>Ratatoskr screamed in pain and anger when the poison touched its skin. It did have resistance towards poison, but it couldn\u2019t do anything about its skin melting and the pain it brought.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho stepped back instead of charging and summoned the fake Heda. The fake Heda that appeared below him donned the Flying Horse Wing Coat in an instant and transformed into a white horse.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho said. The fake Heda became Tae Ho\u2019s wings. She flew at an overwhelming speed and charged towards Ratatoskr.</p><br/><p>Ratatoskr looked at Tae Ho and the fake Heda even while screaming. It cursed out and unleashed its aura once again.</p><br/><p>Petrifying evil eyes.</p><br/><p>It was the strong power of a curse that contained Ratatoskr\u2019s eyes, but Tae Ho didn\u2019t budge even a little. It was because the moment its evil eyes activated, Odin\u2019s rune magic, that was engraved in Tae Ho\u2019s body, activated at the same time.</p><br/><p>Odin was someone that took preparations.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t only wait the past nine days. He had prepared several runes in case Tae Ho returned victorious.</p><br/><p>The curse of the evil eyes clashed with the protection rune. A loud sound as glass breaking was heard.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho charged at that moment and swung Caliburn towards Ratatoskr\u2019s exposed waist.</p><br/><p>\u201c<i>Kuagh!</i>\u201d</p><br/><p>Ratatoskr\u2019s body was at least 50 meters big, but the wound left behind by Caliburn wasn\u2019t shallow at all. The sacred power behind Camelot\u2019s glory burned down Ratatoskr\u2019s aura, and violet blood surged up like a fountain.</p><br/><p>\u201cNidhogg! Nidhogg! Save me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ratatoskr looked down at Nidhogg that was biting its tail and screamed.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho, who was taking a turn in the air with the fake Heda, felt absurd at Ratatoskr\u2019s shamelessness, but it didn\u2019t stop.</p><br/><p>\u201cSave me! Save me! We are friends!\u201d</p><br/><p>Niddhogg reacted at the yell that was close to being a sort of abuse. Precisely speaking, it flinched at the last word.</p><br/><p>The strength in Nidhogg\u2019s jaw grew weaker. It was unavoidable. Ratatoskr was the only one for Nidhogg for a thousand years. No matter if it was good or evil, it was still the only one for it.</p><br/><p>But that Ratatoskr was begging it to save it. Was yelling that it was its friend.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg felt like crying. It was an emotion that was hard to explain. She disliked the Ratatoskr that only said bad words, but her heart beat at the single word of friend.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg opened its mouth and in the end let go of Ratatoskr.</p><br/><p>\u201cStupid bitch!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ratatoskr yelled its tail and hit Nidhogg\u2019s head. It seemed like it was planning to push down Nidhogg below the line and escape.</p><br/><p>\u201cNidhogg!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho yelled hurriedly.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg stumbled after being hit by Ratatoskr. As it was barely hanging, it couldn\u2019t endure it anymore with its own strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, with its own strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>A strong gravity magic covered Nidhogg\u2019s body and stuck her to Yggdrasil. It was done by Odin that was inside of Nidhogg.</p><br/><p>Ratatoskr couldn\u2019t believe its eyes, and Tae Ho didn\u2019t leave it alone anymore.</p><br/><p>He charged towards Ratatoskr with the fake Heda like a meteor. When Ratatoskr raised its head, it was too late.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho\u2019s sword split Ratatoskr\u2019s head. It fell down instead of the snakes and screamed,</p><br/><p>\u201cRatatoskr!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg yelled in surprise, but it was different for Tae Ho. It hadn\u2019t died yet, although that didn\u2019t mean that it was immortal and could live even if its head got cut off.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s real body is a squirrel.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was just like Cuchulainn had said. The body of a woman that surged up from its forehead was merely a part of its body. But it didn\u2019t mean that it was its essence.</p><br/><p>If one used bugs as an example, it was like an antennae.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho checked the neck of Ratatoskr with the snakes at the same time and then looked at the head that was below the waist of the human form -Ratatoskr\u2019s real body.</p><br/><p>\u201c<i>Tch!</i>\u201d</p><br/><p>Ratatoskr had pretended to play dead to try to escape, but it hadn\u2019t worked. It turned its body around, but Tae Ho was a bit faster.</p><br/><p>The flashbangs Tae Ho threw like shurikens exploded right in front of Ratatoskr, and at that moment, it yelled in fear as its vision was robbed.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho pulled out Caladbolg instead of Caliburn. He jumped down from the back of the fake Heda and landed on Ratatoskr\u2019s forehead -precisely speaking, on the organ that was shaped like a woman at the part he\u2019d severed.</p><br/><p>Although its head had been cut, it was still connected to Ratatoskr.</p><br/><p>In addition, it was easier to inflict wounds on it as it didn\u2019t have fur or thick, leathery skin covering this part.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho slipped off while following the back of the human-shaped form and stabbed Caladbolg into the flesh that connected Ratatoskr and the human. New pain shook Ratatoskr\u2019s head and it struggled, but it wasn\u2019t enough. Tae Ho pushed the blade even deeper and then released lightning.</p><br/><p>A soundless thunder swallowed the squirrel\u2019s impending scream.</p><br/><p>Ratatoskr couldn\u2019t let out a sound, and because of that, Tae Ho expelled lightning once again.</p><br/><p>\u201c<i>Kuaagh!</i>\u201d</p><br/><p>Ratatoskr couldn\u2019t endure it anymore. Hanging onto Yggdrasil was also proving to be hard.</p><br/><p>\u201cSave me! Save me! I will do whatever you ask me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ratatoskr begged while bowing its head in an inclination. Tae Ho didn\u2019t believe its words one bit but still nodded. This was because he had a method to make it submit whether its words were real or not.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my turn.\u201d</p><br/><p>The one that appeared through a hole in Nidhogg\u2019s forehead was Odin.</p><br/><p>\u201c<i>Hik?!</i> Odin?! Weren\u2019t you bitten by the World Wolf and killed?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ratatoskr looked at Odin and spoke with a high-pitched voice.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is that indeed the case?\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn exclaimed with a low voice. It had been ten days since he\u2019d gotten caught in the roots with Tae Ho, so it was understandable that those rumors would have circulated. There was a high probability that everyone in Asgard now believed that the two of them were dead.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho frowned. He had crossed the line, but he still couldn\u2019t connect with Idun even if he used \u2018Idun\u2019s Warrior\u2019, maybe because he was still near that line.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s calm down.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho soothed himself with some slow, deep breaths. Now that he had suppressed Ratatoskr, he had to listen to the situation from it.</p><br/><p>Odin said to Ratatoskr,</p><br/><p>\u201cI will now engrave runes of obedience in you. Don\u2019t resist and take it.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a rune meant to suppress the adversary and make them obey, just like the name implied.</p><br/><p>The one that had the runes engraved within them couldn\u2019t disobey the order of the one that had placed them there, and if they did, they would suffer a terrible pain and inevitably die. It was magic no different than a curse.</p><br/><p>In addition, the one using this rune magic was none other than the King of Gods and God of Magic, Odin. Ratatoskr felt terrible, but he couldn\u2019t do anything.</p><br/><p>Odin began to engrave the runes of obedience one by one. Eventually, they numbered nine in total, and each of them possessed tremendous magic power.</p><br/><p>Ratatoskr completely erased its thoughts about resisting or escaping. It had no other means than living as Odin\u2019s slave forever.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg looked at that Ratatoskr with depressed eyes.</p><br/><p>And after a few minutes passed-</p><br/><p>Odin finished engraving all of the runes and stood up. He then gave Ratatoskr its first order.</p><br/><p>\u201cRatatoskr, tell me all that\u2019s happened during the past 12 days. What\u2019s happened outside of the root?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ratatoskr rolled its big eyes before beginning to speak with a sigh.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 38 \u2013 Ratatoskr (4) &gt; End</p><hr/><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/>\n</div>"}

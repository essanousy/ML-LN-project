There wasn\u2019t only one or two big warriors in front of her, there were five of them.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho didn\u2019t know, but actually Valhalla didn\u2019t take in warriors every day. At least once in a few days or at most once in a day.</p><br/><p>As a warrior\u2019s soul entered the souls resting room at the entrance of Valhalla, it fell asleep until it\u2019s turn so that it wouldn\u2019t notice the passage of time.</p><br/><p>Whatever the case, the important thing was that they gathered the warriors and received them at once.</p><br/><p>It was different for popular legions like Odin\u2019s or Thor\u2019s legion and it depended on the situation in Midgard, but there were times that they received hundreds of warriors at once.</p><br/><p>Because of that, five warriors wasn\u2019t that big of a number. You could say that it was rather low.</p><br/><p>But everything depended on who you were talking about.</p><br/><p>Five was a big number for Idun\u2019s legion as it reached a record of 500%!</p><br/><p>In addition, the time they gathered warriors this time was short. As Heda looked at her surroundings she noticed that the number of warriors that entered the other legions only amounted to ten.</p><br/><p>Five people</p><br/><p>Ohh five people!</p><br/><p>It was different to when Tae Ho entered. She could be calm with Tae Ho as it was the first time someone entered Idun\u2019s legion since the Great War and was a really unexpected thing.</p><br/><p>But this time, she was somewhat looking for it and the results were more than she had thought of, so her mouth dropped open unconsciously.</p><br/><p>If she had a tail, she would be waving it really quickly. Heda forced down her urge to jump everywhere and said calmly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a moment I will check your names.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda opened the pocket that was hanging on her waist and then spread the list as if it was something she usually did.</p><br/><p>\u2018There are, there are!\u2019</p><br/><p>The names of five warriors were really listed on it.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, right. Yeah. But I will still check your names just in case. Answer me if I call out your name.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda called out the name of each of them and every time, the warriors answered with a loud voice.</p><br/><p>But it was when Heda finished naming the five of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe most beautiful Valkyrie.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe prettiest Valkyrie in Valhalla.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Valkyrie that is prettier than even a Goddess!\u201d</p><br/><p>The warriors called out to Heda with their own methods.</p><br/><p>Heda cleared her throat at the embarrassing but nice to hear nicknames and then asked after flushing.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm\u2026.what? Do you have anything you want to ask? Ah, I\u2019m Heda. Called me that way.\u201d</p><br/><p>For her to be the prettiest Valkyrie in Valhalla. Was Tae Ho the one that spread the rumors? And just what was the Valkyrie that is prettier than even a Goddess? Tae Ho wouldn\u2019t have been able to meet that many Goddesses. Or was he talking about Freya, the Goddess of beauty and magic?</p><br/><p>\u2018Tae Ho, you too.\u2019</p><br/><p>He is so childish.</p><br/><p>It was when Heda was twisting her body and thinking about Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>One of the warriors that looked at each other raised his hand and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cValkyrie Heda. Where\u2019s the ship of our legion?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Heda asked back unconsciously, another warrior asked while his eyes shone.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun\u2019s warrior said that we had a really big and cool ship.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, right. It was a luxurious ship that was adorned in gold.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was a cool ship that could carry hundreds of people. It could even fly on the sky.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed like they were talking about the flying pirate ship.</p><br/><p>But that wasn\u2019t the important thing. The important thing was that the warriors were looking at her with eyes filled with expectation. In addition, one of them looked at the wooden boat that was behind her and Heda felt like she could listen to his thoughts.</p><br/><p>That wooden boat shouldn\u2019t be it, right?</p><br/><p>Ey, no way.</p><br/><p>Idun\u2019s legion wasn\u2019t a place that kids played war at.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026..so\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda felt cold sweat dripping from her back. Tae Ho could come up boldly as nothing, but the situation was different this time. There were too many things the warriors had heard before entering the legion compared to Tae Ho that didn\u2019t know anything.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tae Ho!\u2019</p><br/><p>Just know he was the subject of affection but now he was the subject of resentment. How could he lie like that and how would he take care of it?</p><br/><p>\u201cWill you wait for a moment?\u201d</p><br/><p>She had to first put off the urgent fire. Even if she came up confidently as Tae Ho- no, as boldly as him, the wooden boat in front of her was too small to carry all five warriors. She couldn\u2019t make repeated trips while leaving the warriors standing on the dock so she had to come up with something.</p><br/><p>Heda hurriedly drew a rune in the air and threw a white feather to the air. And then, the white feather transformed into a beautiful owl and started to fly towards the residence of Idun.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust a moment, a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>The simple warriors didn\u2019t doubt that Heda\u2019s reaction was suspicious but rather let out sighs of exclamation while checking their surroundings. As she heard the stories in between, it seemed like their expectation towards the residence was great.</p><br/><p>\u2018What do I do?\u2019</p><br/><p>That tens of Valkyries prepared delicious and luxurious meals everyday. Just what kind of residence was he talking about?!</p><br/><p>Heda pressed her mouth shut to hide her anxiousness and then looked at the direction the owl flew at. A reaction returned when the ships of the other legions started to leave one by one.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeda, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha, that appeared as a sea serpent, transformed back into the shape of a Goddess and landed on the dock. The warriors clapped, enjoying the flashy transformation.</p><br/><p>Heda said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are new warriors that entered the legion. I forgot about the number of warriors and brought a small ship. That\u2019s why I would appreciate it if you could help.\u201d</p><br/><p>Compared to Heda\u2019s leisurely words, she sent an earnest gaze and Adenmaha that was fast to catch on things just nodded slowly instead of breaking the atmosphere by saying things like \u2018only a small boat? Our legion only has that boat.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cWell\u2026..it\u2019s unavoidable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Thank you! I really appreciate it!\u2019</p><br/><p>Heda moved here mouth and sent a gaze filled with thankfulness and Adenmaha snorted like always and then jumped back into the water and transformed into a sea serpent.</p><br/><p>\u201cTwo will get on the boat with me and the remaining three will ride on Adenmaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOhh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOhhhhh!\u201d</p><br/><p>The greatly moved warriors discussed about who would ride on Adenmaha, but the one that had the final decision was none other than her. Adenmaha picked three warriors that seemed to be the lightest and the ones that weren\u2019t picked put on depressed faces and got on the wooden boat.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmhm. Does someone want to smoke?\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda departed from the dock and then asked after taking out the cigarette. Compared to Tae Ho, all of them wanted to smoke it but there was only one cigarette.</p><br/><p>Heda told them to smoke it in turns and then gave it to the warrior closest to her. Heda could hide that she had coughed out the smoke because the warriors were fighting on who would smoke it first.</p><br/><p>Heda fixed her posture to sit more comfortably and then looked at the warriors smoking the cigarette with a satisfied expression but then worry filled their faces.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Are you hurt? Or is it cold?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Adenmaha asked the warrior that was riding on her, the handsome warrior that had a long beard shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it. I\u2019m just moved. One of the reasons is because I entered Valhalla but the main reason is because I also became a warrior that rides on Valkyries, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>So he was trembling because he was happy.</p><br/><p>The warriors that were sitting behind the bearded warrior cheered.</p><br/><p>\u201cOhh! Warriors that rides on Valkyries!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to get beaten? Do you still want to spout nonsense? I will turn over.\u201d</p><br/><p>The last one was Adenmaha and the warrior that received the gaze of a sea serpent directly could only shut their mouths and shrink down.</p><br/><p>it was poor to see the dispirited warriors but Heda ended up laughing unconsciously. The warriors that were riding on the boat asked that Heda.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that Idun\u2019s legion possesses the best food in Valhalla and that it\u2019s not from this world. Is that true?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs it\u2019s food from Valhalla, it\u2019s already not from this world right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I also heard that it\u2019s the most delicious in Valhalla.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, right. I also heard that.\u201d</p><br/><p>The warriors talked among themselves and brought out topics to speak about.</p><br/><p>\u201cI also heard that there are beauties that are comparable to Valkyries.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that the only thing? Ragnar Lodbrok. I also heard that the king of the vikings is residing in Idun\u2019s residence.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOhh Ragnar! Ragnar Lodbrok!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are also strong and cool Shinsoos.\u201d</p><br/><p>The warriors put on shining expressions again. The warrior that was closest to Heda asked her with shining eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m really expecting going towards the residence.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda clenched her fists unconsciously and drew a smile.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>\u201cHeda told me that you will pay for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The day after the warriors arrived at the residence.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha got summoned by Tae Ho and clicked her tongue.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should have held yourself in the exaggeration, how could you make up things?\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha got summoned to a small cabin inside the flying pirate ship. It was carrying all hundred warriors of Valhalla but it had still surpassed the limit even though the ship had increased to its maximum size.</p><br/><p>Because of that Adenmaha\u2019s shoulder was touching with Tae Ho\u2019s. Tae Ho shook his hands and said:</p><br/><p>\u201cEy, when did I make up things? There\u2019s you and Heda in the residence. And also captain Siri and Scathach-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>The part that Idun\u2019s residence was a place that beauties stayed at in Valhalla wasn\u2019t made up. Although he did exaggerate the numbers a bit.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmhm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha snorted like a always as if she was happy that she got named. Tae Ho snickered and continued speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn addition, master Ragnar really is there.\u201d</p><br/><p>If it were the strong and cool Shinsoos he had Adenmaha, McLaren, Rolo and his wives.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about the food?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s the food Heda made, then it\u2019s the most delicious in the whole world. You also eat it everyday so why don\u2019t you know? Ah, I want to eat food made by Heda.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, yes. How infalible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha said with lukewarm eyes and Tae Ho relaxed his body a bit.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo new warriors really entered our legion.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was the result of some months of publicizing.</p><br/><p>He thought that it wasn\u2019t completely proper to be happy as you had to die first to enter Valhalla, but whatever the case it was true that he was happy.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey said they were warriors that died against the battle with the fomoires. They all fought valiantly because they believed that they could go to Valhalla.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening to it, it seemed like they were the warriors that had died in the recent battle against the fomoires.</p><br/><p>\u2018So this was what master Ragnar spoke about?\u2019</p><br/><p>The warriors of Midgard knew that Valhalla existed. Because of that they thought that it was more important how they died rather than when and they didn\u2019t fear death in the battlefield.</p><br/><p>But it all had its limits.</p><br/><p>If all men wished for a brave death in the battlefield, the world could only become a mess.</p><br/><p>The warriors were more specialized in destroying rather than creating. Just who would work the field and make buildings if everyone wanted to become warriors?</p><br/><p>If young men threw their lives like nothing, then the heritage of the families would only get cut off.</p><br/><p>A world with endless wars was just like hell.</p><br/><p>And Odin didn\u2019t wish for a world like that.</p><br/><p>Because Midgard wasn\u2019t a human farm to replenish warriors of Valhalla.</p><br/><p>It was a precious world were countless lives grew up.</p><br/><p>Ingrid had said that it wasn\u2019t good for the warriors of Valhalla to stay in the mortal world for a long time.</p><br/><p>It was obvious. The more the humans of Midgard saw the activities of the warriors of Valhalla, they would value the life after death to be more important than their current lives.</p><br/><p>Rasgrid hadn\u2019t made the warriors stay in the shrine for nothing. Having sent back most of the warriors to Valhalla right after the battle with the fomoires ended was for same reason.</p><br/><p>\u2018When the cleanup of the fomoires and the searching of Garmr\u2019s soul fragments ends, Valhalla will distance itself with Midgard. We will stop deploying warriors for at least tens of years\u2026.or perhaps for dozens of years. The best thing is for the existence of the warriors of Valhalla to stay as legends inside of myths. We are too close to them right now.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho remembered Ragnar\u2019s words and nodded. Even Tae Ho, that didn\u2019t belong to Midgard, found the current situation to not be normal.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, and I have something to discuss with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha, that was looking at Tae Ho thinking by himself, flicked her shoulder and then said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe number of warriors will keep increasing from now on so\u2026\u2026Heda asked me if I wasn\u2019t thinking of becoming a Valkyrie.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can become one?\u201d</p><br/><p>Because Adenmaha was a Goddess of the Tuatha De Danann.</p><br/><p>However she just shrugged as if it was nothing.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not that I can\u2019t. And if you look at it with another point of view, it\u2019s rather similar.\u201d</p><br/><p>Valkyries had a low stature but they were still Goddesses. Looking at it from Adenmaha\u2019s point of view, that was just a normal Goddess of the Tuatha De Danann, her rank didn\u2019t increase or get lower, it was just moving to a side.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think, master? Would you like it if I became a Valkyrie?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will always welcome it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Actually in Tae Ho\u2019s situation, nothing would change in his life if she became a Valkyrie of Idun but he would gain quite a bit from it if he looked at her battle prowess.</p><br/><p>He could strengthen her with the \u2018warrior that rides on Valkyries\u2019 and also register her with the \u2018warrior that had a Valkyrie meet him\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm. I will think about it then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, I will be waiting for the day I receive a blessing from you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha\u2019s mood became good at Tae Ho\u2019s words and then stood up from her place.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will be going now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, tell Heda how I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha frowned because he kept calling out Heda until the end and then disappeared while snorting.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho got left alone in the cabin and started to think.</p><br/><p>\u2018Wait a moment. We will reach the mountain ranges of Katon in two days, and new warriors entered today\u2026\u2026..\u2019</p><br/><p>At least tonight, or tomorrow at night.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho fell asleep early and then could face the one he had expected.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy warrior Tae Ho! There are a lot of things I want to talk to you about!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Goddess of youth Idun.</p><br/><p>She was more youthful than usual today.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 30 \u2013 The knights of the round table (2) &gt; End</p><hr/><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/>\n</div>"}

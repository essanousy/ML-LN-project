There was a clear rule existing in the connection of a world. It was especially the case in the huge connecting path.</p><br/><p>Olympus and the Temple were each connected with two worlds.</p><br/><p>Erin was only connected with Asgard.</p><br/><p>And Asgard had connections with four worlds called Olympus, the Temple, Erin and earth.</p><br/><p>The existence of the connecting path.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why Asgard wasn\u2019t connected directly to the other worlds connected with Olympus and the Temple. It couldn\u2019t be connected.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>The returning trip to Asgard was quite fun.</p><br/><p>And it was also comfortable thanks to Zeus and other Gods having accommodate them.</p><br/><p>Because of that, Tae Ho could enjoy the trip in a really long time.</p><br/><p>Actually, Tae Ho had travelled to all kinds of places in the world but all of that had been for business and not to play.</p><br/><p>\u2018In addition, I had no time to play as I always won.\u2019</p><br/><p>Because he always went all the way to the end in every competition. Tae Ho didn\u2019t have an option to get disqualified early and travel.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho took a deep breath and checked his surroundings. The group was currently riding on the back of the biggest child of Echidna and travelling. It looked like a turtle but had a mystical ability that let him fly without wings so it was a really nice guy to ride on.</p><br/><p>Heda, that had been sending him a gaze that was close to being absolute zero at the meeting festival, seemed like fortunately her anger went away. No, it may be that she pretended to have been angry alone.</p><br/><p>\u2018In the first place, Heda is the one that created the meeting saga\u2026\u2026.\u2019</p><br/><p>Thinking about it, that really was the case. In addition, Heda also knew that Tae Ho only wanted to gather the blessing of the Goddesses- and it wasn\u2019t based on any evil desires.</p><br/><p>\u2018Speaking like you please because of your open mouth. Even if you mouth is foul, speak properly. Properly.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Kugh\u2026.Your skills to condemn someone right and proper is still great. I sent an applause to your consistency.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t act crazy. Only your speaking skills became better.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn let out a groan and said. Tae Ho just got hit and wasn\u2019t able to attack with words before but now he could defend and even counterattack well.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is all thanks to me having trained you. I\u2019m feeling strong emotions.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho ignored him like usual and then looked at Heda. SHe was telling something to Nidhogg while stroking her head so it really didn\u2019t look like she was angry. She even smiled back gracefully when their eyes met.</p><br/><p>\u2018Certainly. It was only for a short moment. Well, Heda and Idun-nim at night are\u2026..\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Stop. I don\u2019t want to listen anymore. No, thinking about it I do want to hear. Speak in more details. Or don\u2019t entrust Gae Bolg to master.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018You really don\u2019t want me to?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018How can that be? It seems like it\u2019s now time for me and you to separate. This body of mine, Cuchulainn, wants to be with master forever.\u2019</p><br/><p>Originally, he should have said something absurd but it was different today. It meant that he got tha much leisure.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho changed his lying posture and turned his head. He saw Adenmaha cooking something on a cooking table that was prepared in a corner and she also smiled back when she made eye contact with Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>But that smile was a bit odd. No, it had something strange behind it.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho felt something and then frowned and Adenmaha smiled back awkwardly and focused on cooking again.</p><br/><p>\u2018It seems like she has something right?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Did she put poison in the food?\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho ignored his joke and opened his eyes sharply. And after a few days, when they arrived at Asgard.</p><br/><p>He got to realize the meaning behind her smile.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>\u201cI endured it for long, I waited a lot. I wanted to know it now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, um\u2026.Nidhogg?\u201d</p><br/><p>Inside the shrine of Idun located at the center of the residence of Idun.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho arrived at this place by being dragged by Heda\u2019s suggestion and Nidhogg and got flustered while dripping cold sweat and Nidhogg closed her eyes tightly and gave out an eloquent speech filled with the sadness and sorrow of the past day.</p><br/><p>\u201cI waited because you told me to ask Scathach master. But Scathach master told me to ask Heda so I endured it again. But Heda told me to ask master. That he would answer me when we returned to Asgard. That I should be able to wait because I was a good kid. That\u2019s why I could only wait.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wait, wait, wait.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg had a strong patience thanks to the time she spent with Ratatoskr. But even so, enduring and waiting wasn\u2019t an easy thing. She had just endured things.</p><br/><p>\u201cUhhhh\u2026. I was about to become a bad kid. I barely endured it. That\u2019s why you have to tell me now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg pulled on Tae Ho\u2019s arm and pestered.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn clicked his tongue and said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Those eyes belonged to someone that knew the bomb would explode.\u2019</p><br/><p>In the first place, Heda was the one that sent him to the shrine with Nidhogg so she was also at fault here.</p><br/><p>He had completely no way out of it. Tae Ho gulped dry saliva in consecution and Nidhogg approached Tae Ho. She looked up at Tae Ho that was taller than her with her big and clear eyes and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho master, how are children made?\u201d</p><br/><p>The maybe was a certainly. The question he had been avoiding the past days had returned to him like a boomerang.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026um\u2026.wait, wait.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho bought some time for now. He staggered back and asked for help quickly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Wh, what do we do Cuchulainn?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018What do you mean? We can\u2019t do anything about it. I should step up directly and teach her direct\u2026..hey, you bastard! Don\u2019t bend Gae Bolg! Don\u2019t do it!\u2019</p><br/><p>Looking that Cuchulainn was the only one he could ask for help in this situation was a really tragic thing.</p><br/><p>\u2018But hey, doesn\u2019t Nidhogg already know and is just asking?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Is Nidhogg you? Look at those pure eyes.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Kugh, I feel like I got to understand wanting to dirty a white field of snow that no one ever stepped on\u2026.hey! Don\u2019t bend it!\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn was certainly himself. He wasn\u2019t of any help besides from battles.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho stored Gae Bolg and let out a long sigh. The wall was already behind him as he had been walking backwards until now. Nidhogg was right in front of himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhew\u2026.so.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, about how children are made.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow they are made?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg\u2019s eyes shone and put her face closer. Tae Ho\u2019s heart rate became faster.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen, a man and a woman that love each other.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA man and a woman?\u201d</p><br/><p>Their face got so close their breath was felt to each other. Nidhogg\u2019s eyes were filled with pure curiosity and Tae Ho felt like he was about to die. He ended up opening his mouth in that short moment of pondering.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have to sleep while holding hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018How cowardly, coward! You escape at this point!\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn\u2019s criticising hurt but he couldn\u2019t do anything about it. How crazy was it to tell her the truth directly at this point?</p><br/><p>In the other hand, Nidhogg that didn\u2019t know of Tae Ho\u2019s and Cuchulainn\u2019s situation blinked once more and repeated Tae Ho\u2019s words as if reviewing it.</p><br/><p>\u201cChildren are formed when a woman and man that love each other sleep while holding hands?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYe, yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho answered but it was at that moment. Nidhogg put on a teary face and then started to cry. She was crying so sorrowfully that he felt scared to touch her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWh, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg hugged Nidhogg carefully and asked but she didn\u2019t answer back immediately. She cried to the point Tae Ho\u2019s chest became completely wet and then stuttered.</p><br/><p>\u201cI slept with Tae Ho master but a children wasn\u2019t formed\u2026..Nidhogg likes Tae Ho master but Tae Ho master doesn\u2019t like Nidhogg\u2026.That was the case\u2026.Just like Ratatoskr said, no one likes Nidhogg\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Is the so that was the case attack of Nidhogg an essential thing in Idun\u2019s legion?\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn\u2019s nonsense words were of help. Tae Ho got to get a hold of himself thanks to his sudden nonsense words and then patted her back and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that. Um\u2026.it\u2019s not that a children is always formed. There\u2019s something called probabilities but the probabilities to not have one is higher than getting one. Um\u2026.there are also other conditions too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that is the case?\u201d</p><br/><p>Joy spread in Nidhogg\u2019s face. Tae Ho put a smile unconsciously because Nidhogg smiling after crying was too pretty.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes yes, it\u2019s like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Coward bastard, are you still avoiding the truth?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018It is still true anyways.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho got satisfied.</p><br/><p>This much should be enough. It should be the most correct answer in Nidhogg\u2019s situation.</p><br/><p>But that was just his imagination. There was still a bigger bomb left.</p><br/><p>\u201cA woman and man that love each other holding hands while sleeping. That\u2019s how children are formed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg spoke once again as if reviewing it and then raised her head. She raised her clear eyes while still being embraced by Tae Ho and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, Tae Ho master. Can I sleep while holding hands with you from now on?\u201d</p><br/><p>What did he have to do now?</p><br/><p>Tae Ho dripped cold sweat.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>\u201cMcLaren!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Adenmaha yelled, the big rock serpent rose up and danced and then closed its head to Adenmaha. It looked like it wanted to be stroked.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, it\u2019s noona! Adenmaha noona!\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha giggled and hugged McLaren\u2019s head. Drakon Ismenios opened his eyes sharply and said as if making an evaluation.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, a rock serpent.\u201d</p><br/><p>He looked like he was looking at a livestock. Adenmaha got angry at his eyes and said sharply.</p><br/><p>\u201cMcLaren is your senior. Act properly in front of him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, he\u2019s not even a dragon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Drakon Ismenios snorted and then checked his surroundings and changed the subject.</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore that\u2026.this place called the residence is quite small. Even if we manage to live together, Echidna and her children will look like beasts trapped in a cage.\u201d</p><br/><p>The island was wide enough for McLaren to play around in it alone but it was really lacking for hundreds of monsters to live in it.</p><br/><p>Just like Drakon Ismenios had said, the children of Echidna should just stay seated in this place like beasts inside a cage.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha frowned slightly and then spoke while caressing McLaren\u2019s cheek.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a high probability we will move in no time. In the first place, our master became the main God\u2026.so there\u2019s the possibility there will be big changes in the legion itself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, will another legion with the name of master get created?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s possible or the legion of Idun will just get bigger.\u201d</p><br/><p>They hadn\u2019t spoken properly but it didn\u2019t seem like Tae Ho was planning on building a legion of his own.</p><br/><p>It seemed like he wanted to belong in Idun\u2019s legion just like the God of poetry and music Bragi wished in the past.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways, he\u2019s planning to expand the residence soon. Aside from that, he\u2019s planning to set up a branch in the destroyed Erin. But anyways, he\u2019s going to open up a new land and Echidna and her children are going to live in that place.\u201d</p><br/><p>The residence of Idun\u2019s legion couldn\u2019t even be compared with Erin in width, only that it had nothing.</p><br/><p>Even if they only opened up a part of the destroyed Erin, it was still enough for Echidna and her children to live on.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, so that\u2019s the case. But why do you know things so well that not even I know of?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, that\u2019s because master told me. He always tells me first.\u201d</p><br/><p>The effects of Adenmaha snorting as if making fun of him was incredible. Drakon Ismenios trembled and lamented.</p><br/><p>\u201cKugh\u2026.I would have also known if I was a Goddess.\u201d</p><br/><p>And then he would have also been able to exchange blessings.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha snorted once again at how Ismenios lamented himself. She also snorted this time and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, it\u2019s not only because i\u2019m a Goddess. I\u2019m the future sec, second wife that got recognized formally.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her words trembled at the end and her face turned red.</p><br/><p>Drakon Ismenios opened his eyes sharply at that change and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho recognized that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeda and Idun\u2019nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018I will allow only you so you should monitor Tae Ho well, alright?\u2019</p><br/><p>Adenmaha remembered the words she heard from Heda and nodded.</p><br/><p>Even if she looked like this she had been formally recognized.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, aren\u2019t you the third wife then instead of the second one? And what is that future wife about? Don\u2019t you have to get recognized by master for you to become one?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways. No, leave it. What am I talking with you about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha shook her head to release the blood that accumulated in her face and then stroke McLaren\u2019s cheek again and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhatever the case, he\u2019s McLaren. Get along well. McLaren says that he doesn\u2019t like you but he will still get along well with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTell him that I also don\u2019t like him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Drakon Ismenios said with a casual voice.</p><br/><p>And at the same time at the same place.</p><br/><p>Echidna checked various places of the residence of Idun while being led by Scathach and spoke in a relaxed way.</p><br/><p>\u201cAsgard is a really good place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor now. I\u2019m just wishing that I also like the Erin that will be reconstructed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou would. It will become a place that\u2019s more beautiful and comfortable than the Erin that was made in Olympus.\u201d</p><br/><p>Scathach thought of the Erin in Olympus she visited for a moment and said.</p><br/><p>It was a place that had quite some distance from Erin as it was originally the city of monsters. The structure of the buildings and even the composition of the roads was too different with Erin.</p><br/><p>But it still had the air of Erin. She felt like the emptiness deep in her heart got filled with just that.</p><br/><p>Echidna turned to look at the expression of Scathach loosening up and grinned. She bit her cigarette and spoke with leisure.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeace is certainly good. It should remain like this for a while, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cProbably. I hope so.\u201d</p><br/><p>Scathach said her simple wish.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>\u2018So what is it in the end?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018What?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I also endured it for a long time. Waited a lot. You told me that you were going to tell me when we returned to Asgard!\u201d</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn spoke with a really high pitched tone. Tae Ho gripped Gae Bolg tightly, that he was about to throw reflexively as he got goosebumps by him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t imitate Nidhogg. I have to record this and make Scathahc master listen to it.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I also act cute normally with her so it doesn\u2019t matter and master also acts cute with me. Our night is the real deal.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Oh, please\u2026..\u2019</p><br/><p>It was terrifying just to think about Cuchulainn acting cute with Scathach. Although he wanted to see the usually strict Scathach acting cute at least once.</p><br/><p>\u2018Anyways, what is it? Just tell me clearly. Your name is the God of meetings so something must have changed.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t tell Heda yet.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I won\u2019t you bastard.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho checked his surroundings as Cuchulainn spoke as if it was something obvious. They had come to an empty island where no one lived on purpose so they couldn\u2019t even hear the sound of a bug.</p><br/><p>\u2018First.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018First?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I will show it to you directly.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho activated his saga.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 65 \u2013 The ten realms (1) &gt; End</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/valhalla-saga-chapter-226-episode-64-chapter-2-god-of-meetings-2\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 226 - Episode 64/Chapter 2: God of meetings (2)\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/valhalla-saga-chapter-228-episode-65-chapter-2-the-ten-realms-2\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 228 - Episode 65/Chapter 2: The ten realms (2)\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"95816\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

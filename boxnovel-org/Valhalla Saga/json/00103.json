The white spear had triumphed over Balor\u2019s evil eye, and it seemed to almost be resting within the dirt after accomplishing such a strenuous task.</p><br/><p>The red dragon soared upwards.</p><br/><p>Upon it, Tae Ho had closed his eyes after taking a deep breath. He welcomed the cold, refreshing wind with a smile.</p><br/><p>The dragon\u2019s name was Shooting Star, the master of flames.</p><br/><p>He was flying with a real dragon.</p><br/><p>There was more. As Bress\u2019 life force faded, an incredible amount of runes was released into the air, and the sensation of victory overwhelmed his body.</p><br/><p>Bress the Tyrant. In his time, he\u2019d been both King of the Fomoires and King of the Tuatha De Danann. He was Erin\u2019s enemy of many years and had been one of the ne\u2019er-do-wells that brought destruction upon Erin.</p><br/><p>The sensation Tae Ho felt from Bress\u2019 defeat was unlike his victory over the giants. Perhaps it was because of the new responsibilities he\u2019d undertaken as successor to Erin.</p><br/><p>The sentence of the Milesians and Erin became clearer in his mind as if rejoicing in Tae Ho\u2019s destiny. Tae Ho could feel joy in Cuchulainn\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>However, Cuchulainn was also a veteran warrior, and he was the first to reemerge from his drunken victory into the battle which still raged around them.</p><br/><p>\u2018Not yet. There are still many fomoires left inside the rainbow barrier.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was a big accomplishment to be sure, but strictly speaking, he had only defeated a single fomoire. King or not, just as Cuchulainn had said, there were thousands of fomoires still fighting.</p><br/><p>The warriors of Valhalla were fighting desperately against the fomoires. It had become a battle of attrition between the fomoires that sought to escape through destroying the steel structures and the warriors of Valhalla that dyed the land red as they protected the barrier.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho opened his eyes slowly. Honestly speaking, his strength was all but spent. Even \u2018Idun\u2019s Warrior\u2019 and \u2018King of Camelot\u2019 had faded.</p><br/><p>But there were still things he could do.</p><br/><p>[Saga: The One that Controls Dragons]</p><br/><p>He placed his hand on the scales of the red dragon and several emotions and thoughts were transmitted instantaneously</p><br/><p>The master of flames, Shooting Star.</p><br/><p>A strong existence with a mighty name even among the numerous red dragons during the Dark Age.</p><br/><p>The real Shooting Star was a true monster that was hundreds of meters long.</p><br/><p>In comparison, the dragon which Tae Ho rode upon was somewhat lacking. About ten meters in length, but a suitable size for a dragon knight to handle.</p><br/><p>The soul also belonged to Rolo. It wasn\u2019t actually Shooting Star, the one hailed as King of the Lava Zone.</p><br/><p>But it was indeed a real dragon.</p><br/><p>It was because Rolo had transformed into Shooting Star through the power of the dragon knight and his pact. Although he was rather small, but could still harness the might of the real, legendary dragon.</p><br/><p>So long as he could maintain the transformation, Tae Ho felt it was necessary to educate the fomoires on why the master of flames came to be called Shooting Star.</p><br/><p>Rolo twisted and rolled after receiving Tae Ho\u2019s order. He had made clear that he would only serve Adenmaha as his noonim, but it seemed he was in a good mood after having transformed into a dragon.</p><br/><p>Rolo flipped in the air and then flew towards the direction where the fomoires were gathered. He snarled a meteor of fiery energy and released his draconic fire.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a mere stream of fire. The blazing sphere was like a miniature supernova as it exploded upon reaching the ground. The nearby fomoires were defenseless to resist.</p><br/><p>Flames billowed into the sky. Rolo flaunted like a majestic beast as he flew through the debris caused by the explosion, and many warriors cheered at the dragon and rider duo while others just stared in awe.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s really energetic.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Reginleif spoke after dropping her magic sword, and Gandur had to agree. Before, he\u2019d often appeared like a tamed horse, but now his visage was that of a wild beast overflowing with energy.</p><br/><p>Bracky looked at Tae Ho and sighed from exhaustion. The effects of the legend-ranked saga, \u2018Son of a God\u2019, had disappeared, but the blood of a God still remained in his body. And the overwhelming amount of runes that had poured out of Bress had also helped Bracky recover to a degree.</p><br/><p>He could still fight.</p><br/><p>Bracky acted immediately after he came to that conclusion.</p><br/><p>He dropped his mangled weapon that had been damaged while battling Bress and then extended his hand towards the Valkyries. Among the Valkyries, only Reginleif understood Bracky\u2019s request clearly. She laughed magnanimously and then handed over the sword she was holding.</p><br/><p>\u201cMay Tir\u2019s blessing accompany you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bracky\u2019s forehead was too high up for her to bless him there, so she gave him a blessing on his chest instead. Bracky smirked and knelt down, and Reginleif gave him another, proper blessing as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going.\u201d</p><br/><p>He spoke briefly and then ran towards Siri without hesitation. The knight bastard he had seen before was going all out against Siri. The place that needed Bracky most was probably over there.</p><br/><p>\u201cThoor!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bracky roared and drew attention to his presence with a mighty battle cry.</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cImpressive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loki spoke craftily. He put on a smile mixed with admiration as he moved his hands busily. For mere intermediate-ranked warriors to be able to defeat Bress the Tyrant\u2026. It was entirely possible had he been completely sealed, but the seal had failed because of his own intervention. The efforts of the forces of Valhalla must have been limited with only the seals of the Valkyries.</p><br/><p>\u2018I suppose\u2026. Is it Idun\u2019s warrior this time too?\u2019</p><br/><p>Loki smiled bitterly and frowned. He was almost at his limit anyways.</p><br/><p>\u201cSee you around, brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loki activated the several magics he had prepared beforehand and melted into the void. Thor\u2019s thunder tore into Loki\u2019s position a second too late, and in the second it took to eradicate the traces of Loki\u2019s magic, the tricky God had already completely vanished from Thor\u2019s sensory perception.</p><br/><p>\u201cLoki!\u201d</p><br/><p>Thor let out an enraged howl. However no reply came back and another furious rumble of thunder subsequently shook the sky.</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>The Magician King, Utgard Loki, frowned upon his throne in Jotunheim.</p><br/><p>He\u2019d evidently sensed the death of Bress the Tyrant.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s unfortunate.\u2019</p><br/><p>He thought he would be able to use him a bit longer.</p><br/><p>But it was unavoidable. Valhalla\u2019s attack this time had been really unexpected. Having deployed Loki as a desperate counter to Thor wasn\u2019t something he\u2019d originally planned on doing.</p><br/><p>The Magician King rolled his fingers. He ordered the Giant of Erath, Balgad, who was currently marching toward Kalliv Castle, to retreat.</p><br/><p>\u2018Valhalla\u2026.\u2019</p><br/><p>Valhalla and Midgard.</p><br/><p>The Magician King had ran many calculations. Although Bress the Tyrant was now dead, his absence was merely a single strand removed from a massive web of scheming. The big picture wasn\u2019t damaged. He could still proceed with his plans.</p><br/><p>\u2018About Garmr\u2019s soul fragment\u2026.\u2019</p><br/><p>The Magician King opened his eyes slowly to stare off towards a distant place within Midgard.</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>The battle of Kalliv Castle came to an end at dusk.</p><br/><p>In the end, the fomoires hadn\u2019t been able to cross the barrier, and however many thousands they\u2019d numbered were all slain by the warriors of Valhalla.</p><br/><p>The warriors of Valhalla let out whoops of victory. Many Gods of Asgard were praised, and they enjoyed the victory to their heart\u2019s content.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, the losses the warriors of Valhalla had suffered wasn\u2019t negligible. Almost a fourth of the inferior-ranked warriors had returned to Valhalla to become steel warriors. There were also still quite a hefty number of injured among the surviving warriors.</p><br/><p>But even so, it didn\u2019t mean that the light of victory in this battle was lost.</p><br/><p>The execution of Bress the Tyrant and his fomoires at Kalliv Castle was akin to having partially avenged the tragedy that had befallen Erin.</p><br/><p>Perhaps more importantly, Midgard had become safer. As the warriors of Valhalla existed to protect Asgard and the Nine Realms, none of them could ignore the joy of victory.</p><br/><p>The Valkyrie Reginleif retrieved the corpses of the dead warriors and explained the situation to the bewildered humans that had been trapped inside the barrier and had hidden during the battle.</p><br/><p>Gandur gathered the bodies of the intermediate-ranked warriors and the Valkyries that lost their lives in the battle against Bress.</p><br/><p>Rasgrid, Ingrid, and Kaldea proceeded to make a ceremony so that the ones that lost their lives wouldn\u2019t lose sight of the path beyond. They lit a grand bonfire like they had done in the battlefield of Asgard which shone like a beacon across the darkened landscape.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should just rest since you\u2019re really hurt this time. Don\u2019t go drinking or anything because you won. Go to sleep directly. Understood?\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha was Tae Ho\u2019s buzzkill. It seemed like Rolo really enjoyed having transformed into a dragon earlier, and his face beamed with self-satisfaction, although McLaren had eyes as if he wanted to return as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, thanks to you too. You should also go to rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho stroked Adenmaha\u2019s head and dodged her nagging. Adenmaha inflated her cheeks but didn\u2019t push away Tae Ho\u2019s hand. She just waited until Tae Ho removed his hand and then snorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Really what? Adenmaha pouted and then unveiled an anonymous smile before returning to Idun\u2019s residence with Rolo and McLaren.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho waved his hand in farewell and then turned towards his surroundings. Some of the humans who\u2019d survived the battle were helping the warriors of Valhalla to clean the gory residue off the battlefield.</p><br/><p>\u2018Take Gae Bolg first.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn suddenly spoke with an anxious voice. They hadn\u2019t been able to retrieve it after they\u2019d defeated Bress.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really think someone took it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gae Bolg was a weapon that couldn\u2019t be pulled out if you weren\u2019t a successor of Erin like Tae Ho, just like it was for Caliburn.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho retrieved Gae Bolg from the remains of Bress. He felt like the spear of the God of Light, Lugh, would probably also be near.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fortunately, the magic pocket is also intact. Well, wasn\u2019t it obvious as we were in the middle of the fight?\u2019</p><br/><p>Be it warriors of Valhalla or Valkyries, they weren\u2019t ones to grow greedy for material items. They had retrieved the magic sword of the Tuatha De Danann which Bress had dropped and his battle hammer, but the magic pocket was still half buried in the ashes.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho picked up the magic pocket. It seemed like it was an item belonging to the Tuatha De Danann that the sentence of the successor of Erin showed a reaction.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s examine it later.\u2019</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t Cuchulainn\u2019s words, but Tae Ho\u2019s thoughts. Tae Ho stored the magic pocket in Unnir before turning his head. He then saw Bracky and Siri that sat back-to-back with wide grins rivaling each other\u2019s size.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe took care of the traitor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bracky\u2019s words were spoken slowly, and Siri nodded with an exhausted face. Mordred\u2019s corpse was collapsed behind the two of them.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026and Merlin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe went to assist the Valkyries. It seems like he wants to help on organizing the battlefield.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bracky pointed at Rasgrid, who was proceeding with the ceremony, with his chin.</p><br/><p>Merlin\u2019s face was casual as he recited magical chants, but Tae Ho could sense a deep, solemn aura from his back.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe stood at the corpse\u2019s feet for a very long time, and\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bracky closed his mouth, and Siri closed her eyes.</p><br/><p>He had merely heard about Merlin\u2019s and Mordred\u2019s relationship through brief stories, but it wasn\u2019t like he\u2019d been completely oblivious to their connection. He could somewhat understand Merlin\u2019s feelings.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have done well. It was really absurd today too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou too Bracky.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSiri was also outstanding. Did you see how she fought?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA little bit. She also had a tail, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho looked at Siri for clarification, but she merely blushed and frowned. She didn\u2019t say anything, but looking at how she covered her face with her hands, it seemed like she was quite embarrassed.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho forced himself to not remark at her beauty for her sake, but Bracky had other thoughts. He laughed and spoke brazenly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were really beautiful and strong. I will see it at a later time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri didn\u2019t even react at Bracky\u2019s thoughtless words, and Tae Ho, who knew well enough how her brain operated, prepared to escape while stepping back.</p><br/><p>And a few hours later, when the night was deep.</p><br/><p>When the ceremony and the retrieving of the fallen had ended, the warriors then wanted to begin their traditional feast, but there were still stray fomoires lurking about. More importantly, there was a possibility for the fomoires outside the castle and the city to come seeking revenge, so they just drank a cup and then concentrated on resting and guarding.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho slept in a big room alongside Bracky, Harabal and Siri. As all of them were really exhausted, they fell in a deep sleep as soon as they laid down.</p><br/><p>After an indeterminate amount of time-</p><br/><p>Tae Ho opened his eyes naturally. A green plains was spread in front of him instead of the wall of the castle. As expected, a massive apple tree had also appeared before him.</p><br/><p>Idun\u2019s divine message.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho put on a smirk and waited for Idun to appear.</p><br/><p>She always appeared abruptly to offer greetings.</p><br/><p>But something was off. Idun didn\u2019t speak to Tae Ho. She didn\u2019t even approach him.</p><br/><p>Idun had her back against Tae Ho and was transfixed upon the apple tree. It seemed as if she was entirely unaware of his presence.</p><br/><p>\u2018Maybe.\u2019</p><br/><p>If that were the case, him being there didn\u2019t make any sense at all.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho approached Idun slowly and made loud footsteps on purpose. Idun turned to look at him.</p><br/><p>She tilted her head a few times instead of revealing the smile Tae Ho had grown to expect and then spoke with an exaggerated voice as if she hadn\u2019t even recognized him.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, wow. Aren\u2019t you Tae Ho, the warrior of Heda? I am called Idun, the Goddess of Youth. Ah, but where is my warrior that doesn\u2019t only call for me when he needs it but also when it\u2019s really important? Do you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Idun smiled inquisitively as cold sweat dripped down Tae Ho\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 28 \u2013 Great Attack (5) &gt; End</p><hr/><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The destroyed continents, dried up rivers, and the corpses of the living beings that could be seen on that planet weren\u2019t as romantic as a floating island.</p><br/><p>Stars fell down the night sky and a huge path of fire, that seemed to be a sun, could be seen from far away. It was the fire of Muspelheim, the fire that burnt down Erin.</p><br/><p>Although a hundred years have passed since the Great War, the fire didn\u2019t weaken at all. It rather grew bigger and closed the distance with Asgard.</p><br/><p>Ragnar Lodbrok.</p><br/><p>The great viking king stood in a fortress made of steel and looked in front of him. The perpetual was close to him, different from the fire that was burning down a planet. It was the blizzard made by the Frost giants that came from Jotunheim.</p><br/><p>The magician king Utgard Loki wasn\u2019t the only giant king. The king of the Frost giants, Harmarti, possessed an army so big it was difficult to even count them. Although a hundred years have passed, no one knew the complete force Harmarti had.</p><br/><p>Ragnar closed his eyes for a moment and leaned his ear on the sound of the horn trumpet. The sound, that was heard close by, came from the warriors of Valhalla.</p><br/><p>The ones protecting the front lines of Asgard were the warriors above the intermediate rank. If they weren\u2019t there, then Harmarti and his army would have charged over Asgard like a hail covering the coast.</p><br/><p>Ragnar opened his eyes and turned to look at the top of the fortress. Countless steel warriors were standing on top of it as if they were part of the fortress.</p><br/><p>Most of them were lowest ranked or inferior ranked warriors that had lost their lives. However no one in the front lines ignored them. Because they were the real fortress protecting Asgard. They were the great warriors that rose up after shaking off death.</p><br/><p>Ragnar breathed out. He looked at the white steam coming out from his mouth and turned around. Thor was standing on that place even though the sound of thunder wasn\u2019t heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cRagnar Lodbrok.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreetings to the God of thunder.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar hit his chest twice. Thor also did the same and then stood next to Ragnar.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a regretful scene.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thor said. His eyes were roaming on the distant fragments of Erin.</p><br/><p>Thor remembered the destruction of Erin. Because he saw it burn with his own eyes. He was on that place when Erin got destroyed.</p><br/><p>The scene of a planet burning down and disappearing couldn\u2019t be expressed by words. Thor couldn\u2019t forget the misery he felt until now.</p><br/><p>Ragnar was also there. Because of that he knew what meaning the destruction of Erin had for Thor. Thor\u2019s pain didn\u2019t only stop at the destruction of Erin.</p><br/><p>When Loki betrayed Asgard he chose the side of the giants while leaving behind his brother Thor and Asgard.</p><br/><p>Ragnar smiled bitterly. It was a more heartbreaking expression than tears.</p><br/><p>The misery continued even after the destruction of Erin. Because the Great War occurred. There were countless deaths on that war.</p><br/><p>Ragnar remembered the tragedy that occurred in Idun\u2019s legion. He couldn\u2019t forget the back of the woman shedding tears in front of a pile of corpses.</p><br/><p>He breathed out again. It was intentional. Thor and Ragnar put aside the past and looked at the present.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs the warrior from that time doing good?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you are talking about Tae Ho, yes, he is doing well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard he was famous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, he will become strong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar answered immediately. Thor looked at Ragnar as if it was unexpected and then put on a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor the unparalleled Ragnar to say that. It\u2019s been a really long while since I saw that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s someone that will become that big.\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t only because of the saga Tae Ho had. It was the conclusion that Ragnar, that had seen countless warriors and was a great warrior himself, had come to.</p><br/><p>Ragnar\u2019s two eyes resembled a wolf. Thor erased his smile for a moment and looked at Ragnar. He took a deep breath and nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it may be obvious as he\u2019s the disciple of none other than Ragnar Lodbrok. I will be waiting for the day to fight on the same battlefield as him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thor was always sincere. Ragnar answered with a smile. Talking about Tae Ho in detail was unnecessary right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cThor, great God of thunder. I will be returning now.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had already finished his business. The reason why he stayed until now was to say his farewell to Thor.</p><br/><p>Thor put on a regretful face but he didn\u2019t hold him back. He lightly patted on Ragnar\u2019s shoulder to express his affection for him and then fixed his posture. Ragnar also fixed his posture and expressed etiquette.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Asgard and the nine realms.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Asgard and the nine realms.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar turned around. Thor looked at his back for a moment and then also turned around and looked at the direction where the giants were standing at. He looked at the remnants of Erin.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this all?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha looked at he message that appeared in the air and frowned, and Scathach nodded calmly.</p><br/><p>There was no voice or words left in the message of Liberatus. There was only a map.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026.Nidavellir?\u201d</p><br/><p>The world of the dwarves.</p><br/><p>As Adenmaha mumbled while looking at the map, Tae Ho asked once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know what that is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomewhat? I think it\u2019s something like a treasure map.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a specific location marked on the magical message. Tae Ho nodded and Scathach opened her mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe place located in the map is a place that not even the dwarves go frequently. It\u2019s a good place to hide something\u2026..or hide from someone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her words had credibility as it came from her, that had already hid in Nidavellir once.</p><br/><p>\u201cA treasure map. It makes me excited.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha put on the eyes of a dreaming girl and said. It seemed like she unexpectedly liked these things.</p><br/><p>\u2018There may really be a treasure there. Perhaps, the one called Paul may have another fragment of Gae Bolg. And if there\u2019s a legacy from Erin it\u2019s also right for you to have it, as you are the successor of Erin.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn said calmly. Tae Ho, that was just listening silently, raised his hand and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, it\u2019s kind of sudden but can I ask a question?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018What is it?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that successor of Erin thing a formalized position?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn had always told him that Erin\u2019s legacies belong to you, the successor of Erin.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho just heard those words as \u2018they are all ownerless items now so it\u2019s obvious for you, that is somewhat related, to have it.\u2019 But now that he heard it, it seemed like it had a meaning beyond that.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn called Scathach instead of answering immediately.</p><br/><p>\u2018Master.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, I will teach you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Scathach could listen to Cuchulainn\u2019s voice even though she wasn\u2019t placing her hand on Gae Bolg. As Scathach waved her hand, Cuchulainn appeared next to Tae Ho that was taking a similar shape as her.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more comfortable to speak now. Well, to answer you, that\u2019s right. The successor of Erin is a seat that is chosen fairly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn walked and stood next to Scathach. As all of them were really good looking, they were seen as a really suitable couple.</p><br/><p>\u201cErin\u2019s destruction came really suddenly but it wasn\u2019t that we didn\u2019t have time. The kings of Erin prepared a successor of Erin in case Erin got destroyed. Because they needed someone to lead the survivors and raise Erin some day.\u201d</p><br/><p>Simply said, it was an inheritor. It was commonly seen in wars.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut it wasn\u2019t that all the kings in Erin agreed to this. However it was agreed by the strongest forces representing Erin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn spoke up to there and then extended his fist so that his back of the hand could be seen.</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho, extend your fist.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho also extended his fist. And then a flashy sentence made of light appeared on top of the back of Tae Ho\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the message of light that proves that you are the successor of Erin. It\u2019s something I originally had.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a sentence that moved to Tae Ho\u2019s hands naturally the day Cuchulainn and Tae Ho had a conversation for the first time.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat sentence contains the writings of several kings. Master, can I ask you to do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Scathach moved her hand again and then the sentence that was on Tae Ho\u2019s hand appeared in the air ten times bigger.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn pointed at several parts of the sentence and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe sentence of the God of light Lugh, the king of the Tuatha De Danann, the owner of the Red branch knights and my lord Conchobar mac Nessa and the leader of the Fianna knights Fionn mac Cumhaill, the sentence of Miev the wicked woman of rarity, and the sentence of master, the queen of the land of darkness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho didn\u2019t know well but it was different for Adenmaha. She opened her mouth unconsciously and admired. It was because they really were the kings that represented Erin just like Cuchulainn had said.</p><br/><p>In addition it wasn\u2019t the end. Cuchulainn pointed at the last sentence and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the sentence of King Arthur, the leader of the knights of the round table and the king of Camelot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKing Arthur?!\u201d</p><br/><p>As Tae Ho raised his voice unconsciously Cuchulainn tilted his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, do you know him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a high possibility for King Arthur to be different to what he knew just like the north european mythology he knew was different from Asgard. But his heart beat excitedly. King Arthur was a legendary king even Tae Ho knew through games, novels, movies, etc.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn continued explaining.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the only one that received the sentence of light. But i was the only one that remained alive among the ones that received it. And Tae Ho, you received that from me. So you are the real successor of Erin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf the one that made Liberatus is a successor of Erin, he will recognize the validity of that sentence of yours.\u201d</p><br/><p>Scathach added. Tae Ho turned to look at Adenmaha after nodding.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know what it is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can feel a strong authority from it. There\u2019s even the sentence of the God of light, the king of the Tuatha De Danann in it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The race of the Tuatha De Danann was composed by Gods. As Adenmaha was a citizen of the Tuatha De Danann, it was obvious to feel some authority in the sentence of the God of light Lugh.</p><br/><p>With the same reasoning, if the one that made Liberatus belonged to a force of one that set up the message, then there was a high probability he would recognize Tae Ho\u2019s authority. Because Erin was a world where the authority of the king was recognized, compared to the world Tae Ho lived in.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are in your days off anyways because of the expedition, right? Let\u2019s go find the maker of Liberatus or the legacies of Erin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a treasure hunt.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha\u2019s eyes shone again at Cuchulainn\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Scathach laughed at that and continued speaking to Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea. But there\u2019s something you need to prepare before that.\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t preparing for the treasure hunt just like Adenmaha thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho, you should know because you faced it yourself but Bress is a stubborn guy. You don\u2019t know when he will attack you again. So we have to prepare for that.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had already attacked Tae Ho twice in Midgard. In addition as he had failed the two times, his resentful feelings must have grown bigger.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe mystical powers of the Tuatha De Danann isn\u2019t something you can learn in a short time. In addition there are many cases that i\u2019m not with you, Tae Ho. We can\u2019t keep bothering Idun-nim for this either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sending down divine messages every day and maintaining for a long time wasn\u2019t a normal heavy labor.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe introduction has been long. I will tell you the conclusion. Give Adenmaha to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Scathach said and Tae Ho blinked. After a moment of silence Adenmaha got a hold of herself and yelled surprisedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWha, what are you talking about! Ah, there\u2019s no need to speak politely. What are you talking about you witch!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just how did she come to the conclusion to give Adenmaha to her based on what they were talking until now?</p><br/><p>Scathach looked at the angry Adenmaha and looked at Tae Ho and explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cAdenmaha may be immature and weak but she\u2019s still a Goddess of Tuatha De Danann. I will transmit the mystical powers of Tuatha De Danann to her. She will have a lot of time to study as she remains in the residence and compared to you Tae Ho, that has to learn several things at the same time, Adenmaha just has to learn the mystical powers. As she already has the basics she will be fast on learning.\u201d</p><br/><p>Simply said it was a division of labor. Adenmaha was a family of Tae Ho and he could call her whenever he wanted.</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho, you should keep slowly learning the mystical powers like you are doing right now. I will teach Adenmaha and then she can teach you later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand. I will leave Adenmaha in your care.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, the one that will be learning is me.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Adenmaha, that was the one they were talking about, got excluded she spoke with a bulgy face but Tae Ho just lightly swung his fist.</p><br/><p>\u201cFighting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha\u2019s eyes became sharper. Scathach laughed at that but she soon fixed her expression and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho, I still haven\u2019t finished speaking.\u201d</p><br/><p>Scathach turned to look at Cuchulainn that was right next to her and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cCuchulainn, I barely know what you are thinking about. But in my opinion, I think that it\u2019s time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI also think the same. And I think that I roughly know his aptitude.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, it\u2019s enough with that. Start transmitting him the power.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were speaking without the concerned party this time too. Tae Ho, that was just listening, asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cTransmission of the power\u2026.Are you talking about the geass?\u201d</p><br/><p>Because he learnt that Erin\u2019s power that was comparable to Asgard\u2019s was the geass.</p><br/><p>But Cuchulainn and Scathach shook their heads almost at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the geass.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just like Asgard didn\u2019t only have the saga, Erin also didn\u2019t only have the geass.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn was observing Tae Ho and waiting for the right time just like what his conversation with Scathach said. And he judged that it was the right time.</p><br/><p>\u201cI needed a bit of time after observing how you fight and making a decision. Because you are a warrior of Valhalla before being a warrior of Erin. If you learn several powers, you may not be able to digest it all and will rather become weaker. But it is now time. This will also help you on understanding the attributes you are learning right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>What Cuchulainn first promised.</p><br/><p>The heritage of the strong human race that defeated the Tuatha De Danann and the fomoires and reigned supremacy in Erin.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the power of the Milesians.\u201d</p><br/><p>A new sentence of light appeared in Cuchulainn\u2019s fist.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 25 \u2013 Paul\u2019s sword (2) &gt; End</p><br/>\n</div>"}

As they were already in a situation where the commanding system had broken down, they were escaping desperately and in a mess.</p><br/><p>Someone wise had said once that retreating in a battle was the most difficult thing.</p><br/><p>It was because they had to stop the chase of the enemy that had gained the momentum and had to manage the forces.</p><br/><p>But that wasn\u2019t possible as the commanding system had disappeared.</p><br/><p>The army of the dead swung their swords without hesitation towards the escaping evil spirits, and a one sided massacre occurred in the battlefield.</p><br/><p>The evil spirits didn\u2019t stop to live. They stepped on their allies that had fallen without hesitation. There were even some that pushed the ones that were running next to them to try to buy time for themselves.</p><br/><p>And it wasn\u2019t different for the giants. Several evil spirits got crushed to death under the giants\u2019 huge feet.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho looked at the battlefield while sitting on the chair in the insides of the black dragon. It seemed like he wouldn\u2019t need to fight head on because the battle had already tilted to their favor.</p><br/><p>Because of that, Tae Ho put off his hands from Nidhogg\u2019s mouse and keyboard and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cNidhogg.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Tae Ho master?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg, who was staring at the monitor, answered. The monitor, that was identical to the one Tae Ho had used before he died, was showing the scene from the battlefield.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho put his body back consciously and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to try fighting?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cM-Me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg got surprised and hurriedly turned her body to Tae Ho\u2019s side. Tae Ho laughed at her expression filled with uneasiness and excitement and nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, there\u2019s no need to fight earnestly. Just move while trying to make them feel fear.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, okay. I will try.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg needed training at least for a later time. It wouldn\u2019t even be dangerous now that they\u2019d gained the advantage, so it was the best chance to make Nidhogg experience the air of the battlefield and move by herself.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg answered firmly and then placed her hands on the mouse and keyboard. She struggled with her awkward hand movements manipulated the tools.</p><br/><p>But of course, it wasn\u2019t efficient at all as Nidhogg didn\u2019t need those controls in the first place. The mouse and the keyboard were just adorning tools for her, someone who could control the black dragon with just her thoughts.</p><br/><p>Because of that, Tae Ho was planning on stopping her, but Cuchulainn, who\u2019d guessed his thoughts quickly, suddenly said,</p><br/><p>\u2018Just leave her be.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes? Why?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018That\u2019s more cute.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn spoke as if it was obvious.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg was already cute, but now that she was struggling after saying that she wanted to use the keyboard and mouse she couldn\u2019t use well, she looked even more cute.</p><br/><p>\u2018She really is cute indeed.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn nodded and repeated himself, but Tae Ho\u2019s eyes were already cold.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026.it\u2019s hard to move.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg let out a frustrated groan at the right moment. She was cute just like Cuchulainn had said, but he couldn\u2019t just let her undergo a non-efficient training session.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho naturally pulled on her arms and made her take her hands off the keyboard and mouse.</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho master?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg blinked and asked, and Tae Ho smiled warmly and explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cNidhogg, this is your body, right? Do it naturally like you always did. Nidhogg has Nidhogg\u2019s methods. There\u2019s no need to imitate me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand. I will do as Tae Ho master says.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg nodded firmly this time too and then closed her eyes after leaning her head on Tae Ho\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>She started to control the black dragon just like she did when she\u2019d first met Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>And the movements of the dragon certainly improved.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho looked up the ceiling checking how Nidhogg was doing and then said inwardly,</p><br/><p>\u2018Cuchulainn.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Why are you calling me?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Idun-nim would be doing well, right? Heda too?\u2019</p><br/><p>It seemed like he remembered the two people after making the golden apple tree. He missed them a lot.</p><br/><p>His chest felt heavy at the truth that he couldn\u2019t connect with Idun even when he used \u2018Idun\u2019s Warrior\u2019.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn let out a long sigh and then put on his usual fresh expression.</p><br/><p>\u2018She should be fine, and Heda will also be healthy. I mean, the two of them are in Valhalla. Master Scathach should also be safe.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn also missed Scathach. He wanted to see that she was safe with his own two eyes.</p><br/><p>But he had to endure it for now. He had realized in the Great War that nothing good would come by feeling anxious.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho could feel how Cuchulainn was feeling. He dropped his stiff shoulders a bit and then said,</p><br/><p>\u2018Adenmaha, Siri, and Bracky are also fine, right? Ingrid and Rasgrid\u2026\u2026Reginleif, Gandur, Kaldea, and Hildegarde\u2026\u2026Sigrun and Gudrun also preoccupied me. It\u2019s the same for Helga. I wonder if Freya-nim is doing well\u2026\u2026 Rolo and McLaren should also be fine.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Hey.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Speak one name at a time. One at a time. Why do you have so many people to worry about?\u2019</p><br/><p>There was no end as he kept listening to Tae Ho\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho shook his head and answered,</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s not proper to only worry about Idun-nim, Heda, and Adenmaha. If I use your terms, it\u2019s like I\u2019m acting like trash?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018You are trash. And you aren\u2019t worried about Ragnar and Merlin at all? Thinking about it, you only named girls except for Bracky. You really are a bad guy.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, Master Ragnar is an exception. I\u2019m sure he will be fine, and I would have certainly named Merlin if only you didn\u2019t interrupt me.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Sure you would have.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018And are you ignoring Rolo and McLaren? They are also guys.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Not guys, but male.\u2019</p><br/><p>The both of them were saying nonsense mixed with jokes.</p><br/><p>Some time passed after the two of them were speaking. Nidhogg then called Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho master?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis crow is speaking like Odin-nim. It\u2019s whispering to me that it wants to speak with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed like it was speaking outside of the black dragon.</p><br/><p>\u201cNidhogg, wait a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho placed his hands on the mouse and keyboard once more and then activated the \u2018One that Controls Dragons\u2019. When Nidhogg flinched and let out a short groan, Tae Ho became a black dragon once again and could sense his surroundings.</p><br/><p>\u2018Idun\u2019s warrior, can you hear me?\u2019</p><br/><p>It was Odin\u2019s voice just like Nidhogg had said. Tae Ho answered inwardly just like when he spoke to Cuchulainn.</p><br/><p>\u2018I hear you well.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Right, listen to what I say from now on well. We have already gained the momentum. The evil spirits that had their command system destroyed won\u2019t be able to group up, so they won\u2019t be as threatening from now on. But it\u2019s different for the giants. We can\u2019t let even one of them leave. Go ahead and destroy their escape path. I will show you the direction so don\u2019t resist my magic.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho received Odin\u2019s magic power without resistance just like when he\u2019d received the runes from him. Then, an arrow indicating the direction he had to go and a huge teleportation gate appeared.</p><br/><p>\u2018You have raised great merits in this battle. I will entrust you with the final touch.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I will be back.\u2019</p><br/><p>The connection with Odin was cut off. Tae Ho let out a long sigh and then grabbed his mouse.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, Nidhogg.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Tae Ho master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg smiled brightly and then buried her back on Tae Ho\u2019s chest once again.</p><br/><p>A black dragon started to fly towards the giants with its four wings spread.</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>Hela saw the black dragon flying like an arrow from her ghost horse and let out an exclamation.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo tame the black dragon, Nidhogg. He\u2019s really impressive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018That\u2019s right, he\u2019s an amazing guy.\u2019</p><br/><p>Not even Odin had imagined a situation like this one.</p><br/><p>Having turned the ancient dragon into their ally was solely Tae Ho\u2019s merit.</p><br/><p>And due to that several things had changed.</p><br/><p>If they didn\u2019t have Nidhogg, they wouldn\u2019t have been able to finish this battle this easily.</p><br/><p>There would have been many more deaths than now, and perhaps, they wouldn\u2019t have been able to defeat Hrumbak the Striking King either.</p><br/><p>The black dragon, Nidhogg.</p><br/><p>The ancient dragon that has existed since the World Tree grew.</p><br/><p>Although it had to leave behind its true body back in the roots, it was still quite useful. If they did well, they may be able to defeat even the World Wolf.</p><br/><p>As Odin fell in his thoughts for a moment, Hela opened her mouth carefully. It seemed like she was worried about him.</p><br/><p>\u201cOdin, are you in a distant place?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m riding on Ratatoskr and heading to the battlefield. I will arrive soon.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m really glad you are safe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s thanks to Idun\u2019s warrior\u2026\u2026and Loki.\u2019</p><br/><p>If the two of them hadn\u2019t been there, Odin would have died without being able to do anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather really is\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Not yet, he may be alive. Even I, that got eaten by the World Wolf, am alive. And\u2026\u2026.\u2019</p><br/><p>Odin paused for a moment. Loki was someone that had acted as a double agent while taking in all the criticisms and insults from Asgard for more than a hundred years.</p><br/><p>But regardless of that, he had never complained once. He had never forgotten his loyalty towards Asgard even once.</p><br/><p>Odin felt that he was in great debt to him. He had a lot of things he received from him.</p><br/><p>\u2018I still couldn\u2019t repay all my debts towards him. That\u2019s why I can\u2019t allow him dying on me. I won\u2019t allow it.\u2019</p><br/><p>It seemed like he was forcing those words, but Hela put on a small smile. It was because she felt that Odin really cared for Loki.</p><br/><p>The crow that was sitting in Hela\u2019s shoulder twisted its beak. It flew up and said,</p><br/><p>\u2018I will go soon. Idun\u2019s warrior will also return soon, so let\u2019s raise a toast for victory.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cI will prepare a good wine.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crow flew away completely. Hela looked at the crow for a moment and then turned to face her surroundings once again. The army of the dead was cheering and marching.</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>The battle came to an end when night found Niflheim.</p><br/><p>Niflheim was a world that\u2019s sun didn\u2019t rise, but morning and night still existed.</p><br/><p>Night was much darker than the afternoon, and the cold also got stronger.</p><br/><p>Because of that, Tae Ho could only arrive Helheim, the residence of Hela, after being led by a crow, Odin\u2019s incarnation.</p><br/><p>Odin and Hela were waiting for him as they arrived in the garden early.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg looked at her surroundings in glee. It was the first time in her life that she\u2019d ever seen flowers, and fortunately, she didn\u2019t trip as Tae Ho was holding her tightly.</p><br/><p>Hela put on a gentle smile and welcomed Tae Ho and Nidhogg. Odin, who was covering himself with a grey cape, introduced Tae Ho and Nidhogg to Hela.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun\u2019s warrior, this is Hela. She\u2019s the queen that reigns over the dead ones that came to Niflheim.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun\u2019s warrior, Lee Tae Ho, greets the queen of Helheim.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho lowered his posture and showed etiquette just like he did when he met Freya for the first time.</p><br/><p>Hela was the Goddess of the underworld, so just by looking at her rank, she wasn\u2019t below Idun at all.</p><br/><p>It seemed like Hela liked Tae Ho express etiquette towards her, and she put on an even gentler smile. She radiated the energy of a youthful girl and greeted Tae Ho with a beautiful voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cNice to meet you. I have seen your performance well. I thank you for coming at the right moment while representing all of Niflheim.\u201d</p><br/><p>That wasn\u2019t merely a word of thanks. Tae Ho could feel Hela\u2019s sincere feelings.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is Nidhogg. My precious comrade.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Nidhogg.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg, who was hiding behind Tae Ho, imitated Tae Ho and expressed an awkward etiquette.</p><br/><p>It seemed like Hela had heard something from Odin beforehand, so she looked at her with the gentle eyes of those looking at a kid.</p><br/><p>\u201cNice to meet you Nidhogg. I\u2019m Hela.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hela also lowered her posture and put herself on the same level as Nidhogg. Nidhogg put on a bright smile at Hela\u2019s attitude that was as kind as Tae Ho\u2019s and Odin\u2019s. It seemed like she\u2019d been afraid that Hela would have treated her like Ratatoskr.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is Galeon. He\u2019s my advisor and the strongest warrior of Niflheim.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreetings to the commander of Idun.\u201d</p><br/><p>Galeon, who was at Hela\u2019s side, placed his hand on his chest and expressed etiquette. He hadn\u2019t been able to enter Valhalla, but he was still receiving the benefits from the rune system.</p><br/><p>\u2018It seems like he\u2019s in the upper ranks even among the intermediate warriors.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho agreed to Cuchulainn\u2019s short opinion and also showed etiquette.</p><br/><p>\u201cNice to meet you. May Idun\u2019s blessing accompany you.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no way their faces contorted as they were showing etiquette towards each other. Odin raised his cup while everyone was putting on good expressions.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe finished introducing ourselves, so let\u2019s first raise a toast.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hela began to serve alcohol at Odin\u2019s words. Tae Ho pondered if he ought to give a cup to Nidhogg as well, but he decided to let it go this time. It was only one cup, and Nidhogg also had the right to have a toast.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Asgard and the Nine Realms.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Asgard and the Nine Realms.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone cheered at Odin\u2019s initiation. The honey alcohol that was slightly frozen in the exterior was really fresh and sweet.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe-Weird!\u201d</p><br/><p>But this was still unfamiliar alcohol for Nidhogg. Even if it was a sweet honey alcohol, it was still alcohol in the end.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn looked at Nidhogg tilt her head with gratified eyes and then Odin called Tae Ho and Hela.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun\u2019s warrior, and Hela.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes Odin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe battle has just ended, but we don\u2019t have time to waste. We have to move on to the next level immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hrumbak had died and the giants had been exterminated. As the army of evil spirits had also been broken into fragments, there would be no danger for now.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why this was the best opportunity. They had to leave Niflheim and extend their hands to Midgard.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will go to Midgard and gather the warriors that were scattered. Hela, you should gather the army of the dead and prepare to march to Asgard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will obey your wish.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun\u2019s warrior, will you go to Midgard with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I hoped.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hela and Tae Ho spoke as smoothly as a current of water. Odin nodded and then called for Nidhogg that was still drinking from her cup carefully.</p><br/><p>\u201cNidhogg.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should remain here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg blinked at Odin\u2019s calm words. And then she dropped her cup in a surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cYo-You don\u2019t need Nidhogg? She\u2019s useless?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fear filled the big, black eyes of Nidhogg. Odin hurriedly shook his head and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the case. Your body is too big to go to Midgard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026.I\u2019m fat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg turned to look at herself. Odin let out a hearty laughter at the absurdity, but Nidhogg was serious. That\u2019s why he also had to talk to her in a serious tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it. Listen well to what I\u2019m going to say.\u201d</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t only speaking for Nidhogg but also to Tae Ho. Odin looked up at the ceiling and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have installed doors we can open at will in the new Great Barrier of Asgard. It was to stop the inevitable creation of holes and to dispatch warriors more efficiently.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was impossible to perfectly cover Midgard with the Great Barrier.</p><br/><p>Because of that, Odin had decided to make openings that would unavoidably be created. If it was compared to a house, he had installed windows for ventilation.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut we limited it to the size of a human to stop the giants from using it.\u201d</p><br/><p>You didn\u2019t know about small giants like Sigil, but at least, normal giants wouldn\u2019t be able to pass through it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine if it\u2019s only the essence of Nidhogg, but she\u2019d have to leave behind her real body.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg without her body was more of a luggage for them.</p><br/><p>It was because there was nothing she could do as she didn\u2019t know how to fight nor use magic.</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg pulled on Tae Ho\u2019s arm. She said in a low and dispirited voice,</p><br/><p>\u201cI still want to go with you. Can I?\u201d</p><br/><p>Her face was saying that she didn\u2019t want to get left behind alone, but she also didn\u2019t want to be a bother for them. Tae Ho stroke her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go together. I will protect you safely even if you don\u2019t have your body.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was the same word he used on Adenmaha.</p><br/><p>And the reaction of Nidhogg was the same as Adenmaha\u2019s but much more sincere.</p><br/><p>\u201cI really like Tae Ho master!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg embraced Tae Ho tightly. As Tae Ho patted her back as if he couldn\u2019t do anything about it, Cuchulainn spoke with a saddened voice.</p><br/><p>\u201c<i>Ahh</i>, I just hate to see a young sheep fall to the hands of a devil. It really pains me.\u2019</p><br/><p>Those were words of Cuchulainn that could just be ignored.</p><br/><p>Odin laughed soundlessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun\u2019s warrior, I won\u2019t hold you back if you decided on it. Protect Nidhogg well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will do so.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHela.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Odin?\u201d</p><br/><p>The flow of the conversation changed to Hela. Odin first took out a small stick he had given Tae Ho previously and gave it to Hela.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a device that can control the rune of obedience that\u2019s engraved in Ratatoskr. Observe it and discipline it well so that it can\u2019t think of other things. I will also entrust Nidhogg\u2019s body to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will do so.\u201d</p><br/><p>Odin had firmly warned Hela about Ratatoskr before Tae Ho\u2019s arrival to this place as she was gentle by nature. If she didn\u2019t uselessly give compassion to Ratatoskr, she wouldn\u2019t get swept by his selfish motives.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy cup is empty. This means that it really is time to leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Odin raised his cup. He stopped Hela trying to fill his cup and opened his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cHela, I\u2019m grateful towards your unchanging loyalty towards Asgard. As you are Loki\u2019s daughter, you are also like my daughter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Odin slowly opened his arms. Hela understood the meaning behind that, and she embraced Odin like a father and daughter sharing affection.</p><br/><p>Odin gave a blessing to Hela\u2019s forehead and waited for the cups of the others to get filled. He raised his cup and said once again,</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go to Midgard. To gather the warriors of Valhalla in one place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Asgard and the Nine Realms.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Asgard and the Nine Realms.\u201d</p><br/><p>The cups were quickly emptied once again. Odin greeted Hela with his eyes and then opened a space door in the middle of the garden. It was a passageway he had prepared beforehand that connected to Midgard.</p><br/><p>Odin took the lead and Tae Ho followed closely behind while taking Nidhogg by her hand as she was waving towards Hela.</p><br/><p>Hela, after sending away the three people, let out a long sigh. She slowly pressed down her chest.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t because of Mistilteinn that Odin has said to save it until the time came.</p><br/><p>What popped up in Hela\u2019s head wasn\u2019t Odin\u2019s warning but the words of Skuld, the youngest of the three sisters.</p><br/><p>\u2018The one that is connected to you by fate still hasn\u2019t arrived in Asgard. Your fate is connected to the future.\u2019</p><br/><p>Her heart beat faintly.</p><br/><p>Perhaps, she may have inadvertently drawn closer to the future Skuld had talked about.</p><br/><p>And it was merely a guess, but she may have faced her fate that would come true in the future.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t about the fate she would have with her lover. It was a fate that was related to all of Asgard just like the second child Jormungand or the first child Fenrir were.</p><br/><p>Hela let out a long sigh once again. The space door Odin summoned had already closed.</p><br/><p>Midgard and Asgard.</p><br/><p>Hela raised her head and looked up the sky. She clenched a fist and lightly hit her chest twice.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Asgard and the Nine Realms.\u201d</p><br/><p>The etiquette of Asgard she learned from her father, Loki, when she was really young.</p><br/><p>Hela turned around. She started to make preparations to fight once again for her father.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 39 \u2013 Hela (7) &gt; End</p><hr/><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/>\n</div>"}

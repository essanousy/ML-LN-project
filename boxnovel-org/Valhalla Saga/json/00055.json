I\u2019m not excited at all. I\u2019m not even going to make a lunchbox!\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda got serious and said. Ragnar thought of her as a thief that got caught herself and laughed and then lowered his posture and looked upwards. And of course, the thing he was looking at was Heda\u2019s face that was trying to look calm while hiding her embarrassment.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeda.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the end she broke down when he called her. She covered her face with her hands and Ragnar laughed and waited for her.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem ahem.\u201d</p><br/><p>How many minutes had passed? By the time the air outside the hut started to feel cold, Heda lowered her hands. Although the tip of her ears were slightly red, she was putting on her usual expression.</p><br/><p>Ragnar, that still had the same posture, shook his head a few times and then touched her with his elbow.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you calmed down, let\u2019s speak seriously.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he hadn\u2019t brought it out in front of Siri and Tae Ho, Gae Bolg and Cu Chulainn weren\u2019t the only important things.</p><br/><p>And Heda also knew that fact fully well. As Ragnar said in a low voice, the atmosphere around Heda turned stiff.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have already told you, but the giant of strength Harad appeared.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just like Harad knew Ragnar, Ragnar also knew Harad.</p><br/><p>The giant of strength Harad, one of the five fingers of the magician king Utgard Loki.</p><br/><p>The giant kings that existed in Jotunheim wasn\u2019t only the magician king. But because of that, it wasn\u2019t that Harad represented Jotunheim because he admired the magician king.</p><br/><p>But still, it wasn\u2019t that he was weak at all. To face the giant of strength Harad, you needed a warrior that was above the superior rank and had a lot of experience and was also strong.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if it was an independent movement or he received orders but\u2026..whatever it is, it\u2019s certain that the giants care about Garmr\u2019s fragment too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Last time, giants that had merely reached the inferior rank had appeared. If they were meant to search a wide space, that was the most adequate.</p><br/><p>But Harad, that was said to be one of the strongest among the superior ranked giants, had appeared.</p><br/><p>It was enough to overturn the value Garmr\u2019s soul fragment had in an instant.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn addition, Odin has ordered to destroy it immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>If the enemy gathered something, then gathering something for themselves was the most normal thing. However Odin had ordered to destroy it. There was a high probability that had done this taking into account that it may be seized back by them.</p><br/><p>Heda let out a long sigh at Ragnar\u2019s gaze and then dropped her shoulders and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is also like you have said before. I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s one of their plans to wake up Fenrir.\u201d</p><br/><p>The warriors of Valhalla heard that they were gathering Garmr\u2019s soul fragments to wake it up but the Valkyries had heard more than that.</p><br/><p>\u201cStarting for now, searching won\u2019t be that easy.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were no intermediate ranked warriors among the warriors of Thor\u2019s legion that were searching. Most of them were lowest ranked warriors and there were also some low ranked warriors.</p><br/><p>But they couldn\u2019t do that anymore. Now that Harad had appeared, a giant at the same level may appear at any time. That side could only increase the quality of their forces.</p><br/><p>It was a hard thing. It wasn\u2019t because both sides had stepped back from the front lines since it had begun adhering. It was because their strongest forces were glaring at each other while no one being able to move rashly.</p><br/><p>Taking out forces from the front lines to search wasn\u2019t easy.</p><br/><p>But even so, maintaining the same method they had used was also hard.</p><br/><p>Heda forced a smile and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Ragnar, they overdid it too much, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, that\u2019s what\u2019s fortunate. Even if it\u2019s the giants, they wouldn\u2019t be able to spend giants on the level of Harad that easily.\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps, it was a timing game. And one that spent a lot of mental power at that.</p><br/><p>Ragnar also dropped his shoulders like Heda did. His mouth was biting a cigarette, who knows when he took it out.</p><br/><p>Heda looked at Ragnar\u2019s side look and then said something.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think about Cu Chulainn? You met him once right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Erin\u2019s destruction and the Great War were connected. Ragnar, that was a top ranked warrior, stood on the same battlefield as Cu Chulainn several times.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe was an outstanding guy. When I met him he had a really malicious air in him because of the situation\u2026\u2026but he wasn\u2019t a bad guy. Even though he had an arrogant side, that was because he was Erin\u2019s greatest warrior. I think that that much is obvious.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man that didn\u2019t only lose his lover, his family and friends but also his world.</p><br/><p>Cu Chulainn in Ragnar\u2019s memories was a lonely predator filled with malice. But even so, he had a cool head and leisure that was capable of thinking of his allies and read the flow of the battle.</p><br/><p>\u201cErins successor\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda said in a low voice. There was excitement she couldn\u2019t hide in it.</p><br/><p>Ragnar placed his eyes on top of Heda\u2019s.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still too early to get excited. I\u2019m saying until gathering more pieces of Gae Bolg and obtaining more information.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those were calm words. Heda looked at Ragnar\u2019s hand that seemed to be covering hers and laughed lowly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like those are empty words.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because there was also excitement in Ragnar\u2019s eyes which he couldn\u2019t\u2019t hide. Ragnar laughed and fixed his cigarette.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a surprising thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a really amazing thing.</p><br/><p>He could vaguely grasp the reason why Cu Chulainn chose Tae Ho. He probably didn\u2019t have an option.</p><br/><p>But even so, it wasn\u2019t that he chose anyone. Because there are no coincidences in the story of a warrior, Gae Bolg and Tae Ho would have been attracted to each other.</p><br/><p>The geass wasn\u2019t Erin\u2019s only power. It didn\u2019t mean that even its legacies disappeared just because it got destroyed.</p><br/><p>Erin\u2019s weapons, treasures and the warriors of Erin that were still alive.</p><br/><p>Ragnar closed his eyes. He pushed aside his thoughts about Erin for a moment and then thought about Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>Marvelous guy.</p><br/><p>The talent was one thing, but his mentality was also strong.</p><br/><p>\u201cRagnar?\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda moved her fingers and asked. Ragnar grabbed Heda\u2019s hand tightly like a joke and stood up.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s go sleep. You have to depart early in the morning.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar turned off the cigarette he hadn\u2019t smoked much. Heda just looked at him and then asked carefully.</p><br/><p>\u201cRagnar, are you really alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>The last day of the Great War, Ragnar\u2019s body and soul was broken. He wasn\u2019t a top ranked warrior anymore.</p><br/><p>But he had used a myth grade saga. Although it was for a short time, he had fought with all his strength.</p><br/><p>Ragnar laughed soundlessly at Heda\u2019s question. He then turned back and patted her head with his big hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cSleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>He left his last words that were more from a father rather than a friend and then entered the hut.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>The next morning, the group that had gotten out of the hut moved to Valhalla hurriedly. Although the group got bigger thanks to the two female gryphons he had caught along with Rolo, there was no big difference in their travelling speed. Rather, if it wasn\u2019t for Rolo\u2019s injuries, they would have reached Valhalla faster.</p><br/><p>It took 2 days to return just like when they went to that place. They parted ways with Siri in the hall of Valhalla and when they returned to Idun\u2019s residence it was late in the afternoon. After the group finished a quick dinner, they decided a new nest for Rolo and the two gryphons and then had a quick sleep.</p><br/><p>And the next morning.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeda, did you sleep well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYe yeah. And you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI also slept well.\u201d</p><br/><p>You could clearly see that the both of them didn\u2019t have any sleep. First, the black spot below their eyes was the same.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s some bullshit you are saying.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar clicked his tongue in unsatisfaction and said. And then Tae Ho got surprised and looked at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cRagnar, you are also coming?\u201d</p><br/><p>Was he going to follow them?</p><br/><p>Ragnar faced the strong rejecting eyes and put on an even more unsatisfied face.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will only go to the entrance with you. If you really want to enjoy Anaheim you have to go alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>The real Anaheim.</p><br/><p>However Tae Ho didn\u2019t get extra ideas. He turned to look at Heda and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>To Anaheim.</p><br/><p>Heda rowed the wooden boat to a different direction than usual. It was because they were moving to a completely opposite side to the hall of Valhalla, that had the space doors installed in it.</p><br/><p>Ragnar acted like a spoiled father that was following the date of his daughter but he disappeared as soon as they reached Anaheim. Thanks to that Tae Ho could face the second group with a light heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCaptain Siri!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho discovered Siri at the entrance of Anaheim and laughed. It was because none other than her was putting on a skirt.</p><br/><p>But of course, it wasn\u2019t a dress like what the Valkyries wore on the banquets, it certainly was quite pretty.</p><br/><p>\u2018Certainly, she\u2019s pretty even if she decorates herself a little.\u2019</p><br/><p>She was a real beauty, only that she didn\u2019t decorate herself.</p><br/><p>As Tae Ho was looking at her with admiring eyes, someone said with a regretful voice next to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, i\u2019m also here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rolph, that seemed to have been picked all night by the people that knew him, presented himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt feels like it\u2019s been a really long while.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel the same.\u201d</p><br/><p>While actually it has only been a week.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeda-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri, that was laughing at Rolph\u2019s conversation with Tae Ho expressed her manners to Heda that was standing without knowing what to do.</p><br/><p>She was always wearing armor and a head decoration that represented Valkyries, she was different today. Although she didn\u2019t particularly dress well, it seemed like her atmosphere had completely changed by not wearing armor.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe warrior that came to play with a warrior\u2026\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Rolph mumbled in a low voice as if he was surprised and then looked at Tae Ho with eyes filled with admiration.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways, let\u2019s depart. Captain Siri and Heda have come to Anaheim already right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly once.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI only know the market.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat! You?!\u201d</p><br/><p>A rough voice broke the sweet voices of Heda and Siri that were filled with embarrassment.</p><br/><p>As he turned to look he saw someone he was glad to see but not today.</p><br/><p>\u201cBjorn?!\u201d</p><br/><p>In addition he wasn\u2019t alone.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe warrior that had a Valkyrie meet him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe warrior that rode on a Valkyrie!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPant! Is he the warrior that came to play with a Valkyrie?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The warriors of Ullr\u2019s legion and Thor\u2019s legion that he had seen the face of several times were looking at them and were shocked.</p><br/><p>Bjorn looked at Siri and Heda alternatingly and then looked at Rolph and Tae Ho with cold eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you even broke the promise of last time\u2026..there was a reason to it. From now on I won\u2019t be as tactless. Tae Ho, Rolph.\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice was so cold that others may think he was breaking off ties with them.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, no. I\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Rolph mumbled in a low voice. It seemed like he still had many regrets towards the fun night with Bjorn.</p><br/><p>However Bjorn turned back coldly and then crossed his arms in the shoulders of the other warriors and yelled.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, let\u2019s go! To enjoy the real Anaheim!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOu!\u201d Bjorn and the other warriors ran towards the alleyway that seemed to be shining in red. Tae Ho looked at their back dumbfoundedly and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cBracky was also there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Did he come out as soon as he returned?</p><br/><p>However Siri put on a disinterested and hard face just like the one she put on the battlefield and then hit Rolph\u2019s shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cRolph, if you want to go you can.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, i\u2019m fine. I like being here much more.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Rolph smirked Siri also loosened her expression. Tae Ho grabbed Heda\u2019s hand instead of making fun of the two of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Half of Anaheim was an amusement centre and the other half was an arena. Because of that the place Tae Ho\u2019s group could go to was the market, that occupied \u00bc of the entire place.</p><br/><p>Ragnar sat in a wide and long chair and looked at a far place. The place his eyes reached at was Heda, that was laughing at trivial matters.</p><br/><p>It was a nice to see smile that used to put a made up one since that day.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are playing well. How good to see.\u201d</p><br/><p>A voice was heard next to him. Ragnar stiffened unconsciously. It was because he hadn\u2019t felt anyone approach him.</p><br/><p>\u201cStay still. There\u2019s no need to stand on ceremony.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was the voice of an old man. Ragnar breathed calmly and looked at his side. There was a one eyed old man wearing a big gray cape.</p><br/><p>\u201cRagnar Lodbrok meets the father of the sky.\u201d</p><br/><p>He hit his chest while being seated and expressed his manners. And then the old man, the king of Gods Odin, frowned slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>The black crow Munin was sitting on Odin\u2019s shoulder. Not only that but there were several crows in the sky and the ground. There were dozens of them but the people that passed by didn\u2019t seem to notice them.</p><br/><p>Just like the one that had thousand faces he was now a benign old man. His voice and eyes were soft.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you\u2026\u2026come to see Tae Ho?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar asked carefully. Odin smiled faintly and then looked at Tae Ho and Heda and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cI came to visit as I also have other things to do at the same time. I was also curious as to what kind of person he was. There are times when I want to see the world by these old eyes of myself\u2026\u2026and not by Hugin and Munin.\u201d</p><br/><p>How much did Odin know?</p><br/><p>Ragnar just kept silent instead of opening his mouth. Odin smiled again.</p><br/><p>\u201cThor said that he seemed to be a warrior you treasured.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m expecting as to what he will become.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you say so that should be it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Odin didn\u2019t look at Tae Ho anymore. He was looking at a far place in the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cA time where good warriors are needed\u2026..is coming. I can smell the battlefield approaching already. The giants moving could also be one of the signs.\u201d</p><br/><p>A hundred years had already passed from the Great War. You could already know it even without asking for the wisdom of Mimir\u2019s head or the three sisters.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut we can\u2019t be in a rush. Everything has its order.\u201d</p><br/><p>Odin spoke up to there and then took a bite of a beef sandwich. It was a food sold frequently in Anaheim.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is really delicious. I will have to eat it again when I return.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed like he wasn\u2019t joking that he cleared the sandwich in two bites and then stood up. Ragnar followed and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you leaving?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaving seen him from far away is enough. And din\u2019t I say that I have something else to do at the same time?\u201d</p><br/><p>Odin could know why Ragnar was uneasy. He would have already been asked by Heda.</p><br/><p>Because of that Odin said a few more words to the retired warrior.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one thing I learned by watching Zeus\u2026.and his other friends of Olympus.\u201d</p><br/><p>The neighboring Gods with Asgard.</p><br/><p>Odin thought of them for a moment and then smiled bitterly.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing good happened when Gods interfered in the affairs of humans. It\u2019s better to leave them alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Whether their will was good or bad, getting tied up with a God meant the ruin of the human.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will leave him to you for now. Let\u2019s meet at another day.\u201d</p><br/><p>Odin smiled pleasantly and then took out a hat from the air and wore it. ragnar hit his chest first and expressed his manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Asgard and the nine planets.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Asgard and the nine planets.\u201d</p><br/><p>Odin waved lightly and disappeared just like when he appeared.</p><br/><p>Ragnar looked at his surroundings as if looking for the crows that appeared with them and then sat down in his place and looked at Tae Ho and Heda. They were enjoying themselves without knowing that Odin had appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, you should enjoy it when you can.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar spoke in a low voice and bit a cigarette. He was sorry for Tae Ho but it seemed like he would have to increase the level of his training.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>The sun set and night came.</p><br/><p>Ragnar, that was waiting for the dusk, took Heda and Tae Ho as soon as the sun had set and brought them back to Idun\u2019s residence.</p><br/><p>However Heda had a bright face as if having enjoyed her afternoon was enough and looking at that Heda, Tae Ho could also smile back.</p><br/><p>And after two days Tae Ho resumed with his training. And even started to go out on expeditions a week later.</p><br/><p>3 months like that.</p><br/><p>A short and long time passed quickly.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 18 \u2013 Anaheim (2) &gt; End</p><br/>\n</div>"}

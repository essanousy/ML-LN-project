As the King of Gods and leader of their hierarchy, he couldn\u2019t pass his troubles unto anyone else.</p><br/><p>It was only before Mimir\u2019s Lake that he could unwind somewhat.</p><br/><p>Odin didn\u2019t hide his grief here, but it wasn\u2019t only because he\u2019d forbidden almost everyone else access to Mimir\u2019s Lake.</p><br/><p>He had once hung himself to obtain wisdom in this place. As he had already revealed to the lake the miserable sight of his corpse being executed for nine days, he now simply had nothing else to hide.</p><br/><p>Mimir\u2019s head gazed at the King of Gods.</p><br/><p>Odin also faced Mimir\u2019s eyes while slowly moving his fingers. It was to grasp the threads of fate the three sisters had made.</p><br/><p>A hundred years wasn\u2019t a short time, even for the Gods of Asgard. Even though their lifespans extended for millenia, a hundred year period wasn\u2019t easily ignored. Although such a period was a mere blink in the life of a God, their attitudes were founded upon their dealings with mortals.</p><br/><p>A hundred years wasn\u2019t short at all.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why the hearts of these Gods had grown so profoundly.</p><br/><p>A hundred years since the Great War.</p><br/><p>A hundred years had already passed. It was long enough for the ones that had been absent from the front lines to have completely forgotten.</p><br/><p>But it was different for Odin. Even on the day when Thor\u2019s memory fades, the King of Gods must continue to reminisce.</p><br/><p>A massive battle would soon erupt in Midgard.</p><br/><p>When compared to the Great War, it was quite a small engagement; however, this was quite an ignorant perspective. If one changed their point of view, their opinion would also undergo a transformation.</p><br/><p>There hadn\u2019t been any large battles since the Great Barrier\u2019s establishment in Midgard, and this upcoming battle would likely become the biggest in Midgard\u2019s recent history.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Asgard and the Nine Realms.\u201d</p><br/><p>Odin mumbled in a low voice and set his eyes upon a distant place. He looked down over Midgard through the crows Hugin and Munin, the ones who had replaced his only eye.</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>A crow flew.</p><br/><p>Through the black of night, it wasn\u2019t easy to differentiate the crow from the sky.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho\u2019s group hid in a small forest that had grown near Kalliv Ahim. It was almost time for them to regroup with Rasgrid and Kaldea.</p><br/><p>Valkyrie Kaldea was traveling alone. The warriors of her party were busy fighting monsters who had appeared in another forest, one quite far away from Kalliv Ahim.</p><br/><p>Although it wasn\u2019t related to Garmr\u2019s soul fragment, their actions were still useful. The fomoires observing the warriors hadn\u2019t yet realized their substitution for Kaldea.</p><br/><p>The situation was similar with Rasgrid. The three veteran warriors of Odin\u2019s legion had charged her team in a different direction.</p><br/><p>The only Valkyrie to accompany them was Ingrid, who had brought along a certain bait that was their flying ship.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe fomoires will realize our deception in a day or perhaps tomorrow\u2019s afternoon at best.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was the same for Kaldea\u2019s and Rasgrid\u2019s sides. If they felt capable of fooling the fomoires for an extended period, they would have created substitutes and accompanied Tae Ho\u2019s group instead.</p><br/><p>This was why they\u2019d initially divided into three teams; the fomoires were unaware that their base had been made a target.</p><br/><p>The meeting spot of the Valkyries and warriors was within a small hut. The space each hulking warrior and Valkyrie took up made the hut seem ready to explode, but it was unavoidable.</p><br/><p>Rasgrid spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs we\u2019ve now gathered, it\u2019s time everyone knows that the fomoires are indeed based within Kalliv Ahim- more specifically, they\u2019ve fortified the keep of Kalliv Castle.\u201d</p><br/><p>The spot below a lamp was always the darkest.</p><br/><p>After the Great War, before the Great Barrier was created, the fomoires who\u2019d traveled to hide in Midgard followed the rule of disguising their presences within the forests.</p><br/><p>Kalliv Ahim was unquestionably a human country. Most of the citizens were humans, but the fomoires had disguised themselves well.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe majority of the fomoires are gathered in Kalliv Castle, most notably, their king and his circle of nobles. The ones that take human form are either hidden underground or in the remote places of Kalliv Ahim.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kalliv Ahim was a country that consisted of a single, large city, seven towns, and several villages. Knowing this, they\u2019d decided to infiltrate the castle. It could be said to be the core of Kalliv Ahim.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou saw on the way in, right? Only a small number can travel through the Bifrost. That\u2019s why I came here in person after tricking them.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Great Barrier was a shield which protected Midgard, but as it was made too hurriedly, there were many flaws, some of which were fatal. Such flaws were unavoidable, as it had been right after the Great War and Midgard was in dire straits.</p><br/><p>\u201cRasgrid, Ingrid, and myself will make a ceremony. There\u2019s nothing grandiose about it. You can just think of us as being targets easily spotted from Asgard.\u201d</p><br/><p>They would inform them of their coordinates, and Heimdal and Odin would promptly send reinforcements to their location.</p><br/><p>Actually, the role of the three Valkyries didn\u2019t end there. Accessing the core of the great magic which connected Asgard and Midgard was but one of their tasks, but further explanation was pointless.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe ceremony won\u2019t take long, but you\u2019ll need a directive in the meantime, right? Your first task is to protect the three of us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kaldea looked over the warriors as she spoke, and Rasgrid explained further.</p><br/><p>\u201cFighting alongside the reinforcements is your second task. This order will take priority.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the first place, the reason they\u2019d left behind so many warriors was to allow the others the opportunity for different orders while the ceremony took place.</p><br/><p>Just like Kaldea had said, it was a simple task.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe overview of tomorrow\u2019s battle is up to here. Are there any questions?\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri raised her hand as Ingrid asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre the fomoires the only ones in the castle?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was the base of the fomoires, but Kalliv Ahim was still populated by humans. In addition, the influence the fomoires held was great from being treated as royalty and nobles.</p><br/><p>Ingrid put on a pained expression as if a wound had been poked. Rasgrid answered in Ingrid\u2019s stead.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will speak honestly. There may be innocent humans mixed among them, but there\u2019s no way to differentiate them. It is cruel and merciless, but\u2026..you must remember that we are warriors of Valhalla. The operation may be compromised if we try to pick out the fomoires from the humans. We would lose too many warriors, so Valhalla has judged their sacrifices as necessary.\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri\u2019s face contorted, but she couldn\u2019t refute Rasgrid\u2019s words. One might know about two or three, but it was impossible to both tell each one of them apart and fight unimpededly at the same time.</p><br/><p>The fomoires had lived among humans for a hundred years. There were certainly some which could mimic humans in their entirety. She couldn\u2019t help but picture a warrior of Valhalla dying at the hands of a fomoire disguised as a human.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur actions are in order to protect Midgard and countless lives. We must be capable of making sacrifices.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rasgrid spoke with a cold face as if to mask a bitter taste. She was playing the role of an anti-hero to lessen the burdens on the warriors of Valhalla, but she couldn\u2019t help feeling pained by this strategy.</p><br/><p>Bracky nodded with a heavy expression. Harabal frowned, but as he couldn\u2019t do anything about it, he soon agreed as well. It seemed everyone had accepted the grim reality.</p><br/><p>But it was then-</p><br/><p>\u201cSo all we have to do is tell them apart from the humans, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Tae Ho?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ingrid asked with round eyes and called out his name in surprise. As the eyes of everyone gathered on him, Tae Ho smiled bitterly and continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have an idea, although I\u2019ll need a bit of help.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho finished speaking and then turned to look at Siri. Naturally, everyone else also turned to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026you are speaking about me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho nodded at Siri\u2019s awkward question. He took in a deep breath and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a possibility it will be quite difficult\u2026.and really painful. Are you okay with that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Given the context, if she refused, she wasn\u2019t worthy of being a warrior of Valhalla. Siri gulped dryly and then pounded her chest twice.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s within my abilities, I\u2019ll help to my limit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho nodded at the expected answer. He then turned to Bracky whose eyes demanded an explanation, and Tae Ho began speaking.</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>The day was bright.</p><br/><p>The sun was almost at its peak, the city was bustling with energy.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho took in a deep breath from high in the sky. Rolo was grimacing in pain from maintaining a higher altitude that what he was accustomed to.</p><br/><p>Of course, that wasn\u2019t his only problem. Rolo, who usually only had to carry Tae Ho, had a total of three people on his back.</p><br/><p>\u201cEndure it a bit more. Adenmaha told me that she would prepare a feast.\u201d</p><br/><p>Despite Tae Ho\u2019s attempt to sooth him, Rolo snorted as if he were joking. Still, he couldn\u2019t help but look forward to such an offer and poured more strength into his wings.</p><br/><p>Siri was seated in front of Tae Ho with a nervous face. Behind him, Merlin stood precariously as he looked through the sky once and then down below him. Like a beacon, Kalliv Castle was visible even from their extreme altitude.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like they\u2019ve noticed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho nodded and threw a question while grabbing Siri\u2019s waist tightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri gave a short response. Tae Ho nodded once again and gave a signal to Merlin.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s start.\u201d</p><br/><p>Merlin smiled and swung his staff while reciting some magic. Blinding light spewed from his staff and a big, flashy firework detonated above the skies of Kalliv.</p><br/><p>The sudden display grabbed the attention of everyone below in an instant.</p><br/><p>The people in the city surrounding the castle sharply angled their heads upwards to look, and the ones within Kalliv Castle emerged outside to do the same.</p><br/><p>There could have been fomoires mixed in with them.</p><br/><p>Even though she\u2019d lost two guards of the ceremony, the reason Rasgrid had allowed this strategy wasn\u2019t only from the possibility of reducing unnecessary sacrifices. It was because Tae Ho would also be able to attract the attention of the fomoires while the ceremony was proceeding.</p><br/><p>Merlin counted the numbers.</p><br/><p>The ceremony was proceeding smoothly on the ground, and Tae Ho applied strength in his arms grasping Siri tightly and activated his saga.</p><br/><p>[Saga: The Eyes of the Dragon Sees Through all Things]</p><br/><p>In his eyes, the ground was suddenly covered with words.</p><br/><p>Thousands, or perhaps tens of thousands.</p><br/><p>He just focused on Kalliv Castle. Compared to the city, which had overwhelmingly more white letters, many words over the castle were red.</p><br/><p>His eyes hurt, but Tae Ho concentrated even more. The magic Merlin had used allowed Tae Ho and Siri to share senses, and Siri looked down at the castle through Tae Ho\u2019s eyes. Siri then activated her own sagas.</p><br/><p>[Saga: The Eyes of the Witch Chases after Several Targets at Once]</p><br/><p>[Saga: The Arrow of the Witch Never Misses its Target]</p><br/><p>Siri\u2019s right arm was primed like Nuada\u2019s silver arm. As she fingered the release of the giant bolt, five bolts of light were loaded at once.</p><br/><p>The auras of the fomoires in the castle started to expand. Merlin\u2019s chanting became more feverish and Tae Ho\u2019s eyes quickly became bloodshot. Siri finally pulled the trigger, but she didn\u2019t stop with a single volley. She began firing continuously.</p><br/><p>A rain of golden bolts pierced through the sky.</p><br/><p>The bolts that poured down split and divided again and again. By the time they\u2019d reached the ground, they had separated into many small pieces.</p><br/><p>It was more than enough.</p><br/><p>A red blot that seemed to have been applied with paint appeared on the foreheads of every person in Kalliv Castle.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Tae Ho was able to differentiate the humans from the fomoires with his saga.</p><br/><p>He fired a dividing arrow of light with the silver arm of Nuada and a bow of the Tuatha De Danann.</p><br/><p>Merlin then changed the property of the arrow with his magic.</p><br/><p>And Siri-</p><br/><p>Siri hit the hundreds of targets below with deadly precision.</p><br/><p>After exhausting her crossbow\u2019s supply, Siri was almost completely drained of energy. Tae Ho held her tightly and kept glaring at the ground. The fomoires that had by now realized the situation were quickest to move. They couldn\u2019t understand the hundreds of bolts of light that had poured from the sky, but they clearly felt the deadly threat they posed.</p><br/><p>The fomoires capable of flying flew up, and the strong fomoires released their strength. Fomoires also started to pour out from beneath the ground.</p><br/><p>The real humans started to scream at the insane scene before them. Rolo looked at the hundreds of fomoires surging up towards them with an uneasy face, and Tae Ho held his breath once again.</p><br/><p>The reason Merlin had counted their numbers wasn\u2019t for that.</p><br/><p>It was to find the perfect opportunity.</p><br/><p>Siri opened her eyes with difficulty and looked at the ground. Her eyes peered at a location other than the charging fomoires and the chaotic scene of Kalliv Castle beneath them.</p><br/><p>It was the small forest. It was quite far away, but she could make it out due to having shared her senses with Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>The clear green words above the forest spoke to her.</p><br/><p>\u2018Look up to the sky.</p><br/><p>\u2018The time has come.\u2019</p><br/><p>A torrent of light then surged up from the forest towards the heavens. The poor fomoires were perplexed once more by the huge pillar of light that had surged up without warning. The ones speeding towards Tae Ho and Siri were also confused, and they also turned to look towards the forest.</p><br/><p>Siri leaned back on Tae Ho\u2019s chest to gaze at the spectacle. A bright smile was revealed on her face.</p><br/><p>Shapes began pouring down the light.</p><br/><p>The several green words filled the region.</p><br/><p>Merlin smiled.</p><br/><p>Despite her exhaustion, Siri raised her hand to welcome them.</p><br/><p>And Tae Ho unconsciously opened his mouth to utter.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Asgard and the Nine Realms.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was the true reason why the warriors of Valhalla fought.</p><br/><p>As if answering his words, bellows and shouts echoed across the sky.</p><br/><p>The war cries of numerous warriors were heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy lower body feels weirrrrrd!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the same whenever I ride it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUhahaha! Valhalla! I am coming!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was like a rain of glittering steel.</p><br/><p>The dozens of steel structures began their charge toward Kalliv Castle.</p><br/><p>Their great attack had begun.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 28 \u2013 Great Attack (1) &gt; End</p><hr/><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/>\n</div>"}

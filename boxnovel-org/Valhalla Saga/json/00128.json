Even if they said that it was huge, one might think that they could just climb it, but that wasn\u2019t the case. Normal humans or fairies went down when they believed that they were going up, so they couldn\u2019t grasp their sense of direction.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to say that the lake of Mimir, Odin\u2019s secret place, was in the middle of that fog. Because of that, no one could get close to it if they weren\u2019t invited.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s fine up to the lake of Mimir. If they are Gods with a strong divine power, they may be able to find the right path.\u2019</p><br/><p>But the story changed the lower one got. The really dense fog severed the root from all the other worlds.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho couldn\u2019t understand well what that meant when he was listening to the class. That\u2019s why he just took it as being a severed bridge.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a completely wrong comparison. It was rather closer to the answer. When Tae Ho climbed down the root by himself, he got to know what severing really meant.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t feel Idun. His connection to her had gotten cut off. Perhaps, she may think that Tae Ho had died.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho tried hard to stay calm.</p><br/><p>Whatever the case, Tae Ho was alive right now and Odin was in front of him, even if he was in an awful state. He would be able to overcome this situation somehow.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow much time has passed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know exactly. About three or four days may have passed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Odin answered directly Tae Ho\u2019s question. It wasn\u2019t good news. Three or four days was a really long time. He felt a horrible feeling even by imagining what could have happened in their absence.</p><br/><p>The first thing he thought of was the well being of Adenmaha, Merlin, and Ragnar. What had happened to the three of them? Were they able to escape from the World Wolf?</p><br/><p>Tae Ho took out a summoning rock reflexively and inserted magic power into it, but it was pointless. Adenmaha did not appear.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s not because she is dead.\u2019</p><br/><p>Because his connection with Idun had also been severed. Even if it was a summoning rock, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to call Adenmaha.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why it was fine. It didn\u2019t mean anything had happened to her.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho spoke to himself a few times as if trying to calm down himself and looked at Odin. Several things popped in his head, but unfortunately, he couldn\u2019t say it out loud.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t only because he was worried about him.</p><br/><p>He had heard the plan that Odin had come up with from Loki.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why there was no need to ask it by now. Disrespect aside, asking why his plan had failed was more of a detriment to their situation than anything else.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre there no methods to ascend?\u201d</p><br/><p>Because of that, Tae Ho asked the most important question right now. Odin opened and closed his eyes once and then said with an exhausted voice,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that there are none. It\u2019s only really hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho felt uneasy just by hearing him, but the answer satisfied him for the time being. Because it meant that there was a way to return to Asgard. It wasn\u2019t impossible.</p><br/><p>But of course, returning didn\u2019t mean that it was proper because Asgard would be battling head on against the giants of Jotunheim.</p><br/><p>In addition, the situation was bad.</p><br/><p>There was a high probability for the Gods of Asgard to think that Odin was dead.</p><br/><p>Using the army as an example, the supreme commander had died as soon as the war broke out.</p><br/><p>On top of that, the World Wolf, Fenrir, was added, so one could say that the situation was one akin to a sense of impending doom.</p><br/><p>\u2018Calm down. Calm down, Lee Tae Ho.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho took some breaths. If he grew impatient here, escaping would become much more difficult. Just like there was the saying that one had to return the more urgent a situation was, this was now the time to calm himself down.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are calm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Odin smiled bitterly and said in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun\u2019s warrior, before telling you the method to escape this place, I want to express my gratitude to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Odin rose himself up in a mess and placed his fist upon his chest. He then hit his chest twice and faced Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have been able to stay alive thanks to your aid. I succeeded in changing the despairing fate. I express my thanks as the King of Gods.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was a mess, but Odin was still the King of Gods. It wasn\u2019t easy for him to express his thanks sincerely towards a warrior of Valhalla.</p><br/><p>\u201cI just did what I had to as Idun\u2019s warrior.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho answered reflexively. When he saw movies or novels he always criticized the characters because they only said sweet words, but now that he was in a similar situation, he didn\u2019t have anything to say aside of those words.</p><br/><p>Odin smiled, and Tae Ho quickly realized something previously unknown to him.</p><br/><p>Odin was a warrior of Valhalla before becoming the King of Gods. Although he was wearing countless masks, his nature wouldn\u2019t be much different to a warrior of Valhalla\u2019s.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we return, and if we do manage to win, I will give you a big reward. I will grant you anything you wish.\u201d</p><br/><p>Odin said with serious eyes as if he wasn\u2019t just saying it as a thanks. His eyes were rather similar to Ragnar\u2019s.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho answered with the most ideal answer this time but then someone clicked his tongue.</p><br/><p>\u2018You don\u2019t refuse. Right, you have to receive when you are given. Just tell him to marry you to Freya.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cCuchulainn!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho answered out loud at the voice that rang in his head. It was because it was that nice to see him back.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn continued speaking when Tae Ho hurriedly took out Gae Bolg.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why, is it that nice to see me? Do you feel reassured just by listening to my name?\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho nodded. It was because that was indeed the case.</p><br/><p>He was acting rather calm to this situation, but honestly speaking, it was hard on him. He was at the level where he was barely able to stay calm.</p><br/><p>But he felt more relaxed when he heard Cuchulainn\u2019s voice. He felt like he would be able to overcome this just like he had done in previous tight spots.</p><br/><p>Because of that, Tae Ho answered to the first thing Cuchulainn said.</p><br/><p>\u2018But why does it have to be Freya? Heda is much prettier. Idun-nim could be better than her too.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know what expression I should put on at situations like this.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn answered as if he was tired of Tae Ho\u2019s opinions.</p><br/><p>But of course, the two of them were joking right now.</p><br/><p>Their joking marked the thankful return of a more composed atmosphere.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it the Prince of Light?\u201d</p><br/><p>Odin looked at Tae Ho, precisely speaking at Gae Bolg, and asked. Cuchulainn materialized and appeared next to Tae Ho just like he\u2019d done in Scathach\u2019s residence. It was Odin\u2019s magic.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a really long while, King of Gods, Odin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn bowed lightly and expressed etiquette, and Odin nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cI did hear some stories, but it\u2019s been a while seeing you directly like this. Is it impolite if I say that you look much better now than in the Great War?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. Your words are right. I also feel that the current me is much better.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because the Cuchulainn in the Great War had gone mad for seeking revenge.</p><br/><p>But it was different now. He had recovered his mental state just like when he\u2019d been renowned as the Prince of Light.</p><br/><p>\u2018In addition, Master is also here.\u2019</p><br/><p>Scathach, whose location during the Great War had been a mystery to all, was now in Idun\u2019s residence. Cuchulainn was satisfied just by that fact alone.</p><br/><p>Odin still gazed thoughtfully at Cuchulainn before he turned to Tae Ho and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s proceed with what I was saying. Just like I told you before, there\u2019s a method to get out of here, although that method is really difficult.\u201d</p><br/><p>Odin paused for a moment and then closed his eyes and leaned his ear towards the surroundings. Not long after that, a roar shaking the skies was heard from far away.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know who is the owner of that roar?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it the wicked dragon, Nidhogg?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Tae Ho answered after he\u2019d remembered the classes with Heda, Odin nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, that\u2019s true. The black, venomous dragon, Nidhogg, that lives in the roots of Yggdrasil\u2026..You could say that this place is its nest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Several roars were heard after that as if adding further weight to Odin\u2019s words. Odin opened his only eye sharply and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt has been looking for us since before. It\u2019s obvious for it, the owner of this land, to want to chase away the uninvited guests, but we can\u2019t only evade it. It\u2019s because it is the only method for us to escape this place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you saying\u2026.that we will ride on Nidhogg and climb up?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Cuchulainn asked with a doubtful face, Odin shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s similar but different. Nidhogg has been entrapped in the roots since the beginning of the world. It isn\u2019t able to leave this place with its own strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>Actually, the problem lay closer to an approval of sorts, but the important thing was that Nidhogg wasn\u2019t able to leave the roots.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut there is an existence that can. It\u2019s the only one that can freely go from the roots to the branches of Yggdrasil.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe beast, Ratatoskr\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho said reflexively.</p><br/><p>He had also learned about this from Heda\u2019s classes.</p><br/><p>The three beasts living in the World Tree.</p><br/><p>The venomous dragon, Nidhogg, that lives by chewing the roots of the world tree.</p><br/><p>The huge, white eagle, Hraesvelgr, that sits in the highest branch and is the origin of all strong winds.</p><br/><p>The squirrel, Ratatoskr, that can freely travel to both sides and made Nidhogg and Hraesvelgr into enemies when they couldn\u2019t even see each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, that\u2019s the only one, and to catch it, we need the help of Nidhogg, the owner of a part of this land.\u201d</p><br/><p>Odin spoke of the method to get away from this place in a terse manner. They could plentily talk about the other things at a later time.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn, who\u2019d listened to all the explanations of Odin, put on a thinking face and then asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cOdin, is Nidhogg certainly a dragon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s an ancient dragon that ranks supreme even among its own kin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn turned to look at Tae Ho at Odin\u2019s answer. Tae Ho also nodded as he knew why Cuchulainn had asked if it was a dragon or not.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho\u2019s saga, \u2018The One that Controls Dragons\u2019.</p><br/><p>But of course, his adversary was the ancient beast, Nidhogg. They couldn\u2019t know how much Tae Ho\u2019s saga would work.</p><br/><p>But there was still a probability as it was a dragon. One could say that it was a ray of hope.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn checked Tae Ho\u2019s smile and then asked with a more serious expression,</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, Odin, I will ask you one more thing. It\u2019s something really important.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it, Prince of Light?\u201d</p><br/><p>Odin also answered with a serious expression. In addition, Tae Ho gulped dry saliva at the serious atmosphere.</p><br/><p>And Cuchulainn finally opened his mouth and asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cIs Nidhogg a male or a female?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026.what?\u201d</p><br/><p>Odin blinked his eyes and asked back, and Tae Ho put on a dumbfounded expression.</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, did I say something wrong? It is important.\u201d</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 37 \u2013 The one that conquers (1) &gt; End</p><hr/><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It\u2019s important.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is?! It\u2019s the same anyways!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho talked back strongly as Cuchulainn spoke with a casual face.</p><br/><p>Whatever the case, he wasn\u2019t lying.</p><br/><p>The number of draconic races Tae Ho had suppressed with the \u2018One that Controls Dragons\u2019 were few, but most of them were male.</p><br/><p>The demon he first captured in the mine of the dwarves, the wyvern he handled in the Black Fortress, Rolo, who he had turned into his underling, and McLaren, who got to accompany him in Nidavelir.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, all of them were male excluding Adenmaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, so Siri and Rasgrid aren\u2019t female?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, the two of them fought together with me as comrades, not as beings that were suppressed. It\u2019s completely different.\u201d</p><br/><p>The ability of the \u2018One that Controls Dragons\u2019 didn\u2019t only stop at suppressing draconic races. It also had the ability to synchronize one\u2019s consciousness with them and share their senses and thoughts.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn revealed eyes stewn with complaints, but he soon grew surprised and said,</p><br/><p>\u201c<i>Huk</i>, for most of them to be male\u2026..you, do you\u2026..you didn\u2019t look at me with those eyes until now, right? <i>Um</i>\u2026. it\u2019s not that I dislike you, but\u2026.I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t think I will be able to respond to your feelings.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho was completely lost for words as Cuchulainn apologized with a serious face. He just let out a sigh and called the name of Idun.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, my Idun.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a joke. A joke. Do you think I don\u2019t know of your preferences?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn laughed as if it was really fun.</p><br/><p>It seemed like he\u2019d meant to lighten up the atmosphere, and it had actually grown noticeably livelier, but Tae Ho felt rather pitiful now. For this kind of person to be the Prince of Light, just what kind of place was Erin?</p><br/><p>As he was thinking about things that would repulse Merlin and the Knights of the Round Table if they got to know what he was thinking about, the one that was being excluded in the conversation opened his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to know what you are talking about.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was Odin. As Tae Ho became embarrassed and didn\u2019t know what to say, Cuchulainn spoke in his stead.</p><br/><p>\u201cOdin, we were talking about the saga this guy possesses.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSaga?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s a saga called \u2018The One that Controls Dragons\u201d\u2019.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn erased all his playfulness and started to explain details of Tae Ho\u2019s saga.</p><br/><p>Odin nodded after hearing everything.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe one that controls dragons\u2026.So, it\u2019s a saga that can employ resistance towards draconic races?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes but only\u2026I\u2019ve never used it on a real dragon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho answered with a dark expression. Part of it was because of Cuchulainn\u2019s provocation, but whatever the case, he had never suppressed a real dragon once with \u2018The One that Controls Dragons\u2019.</p><br/><p>The ones that belonged to the draconic race were Adenmaha and McLaren, but both of them were merely serpents, a subspecies of dragon. There was quite a distance between them.</p><br/><p>Odin shook his head at Tae Ho\u2019s preoccupation.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere won\u2019t be any problems, and perhaps, it may bring out a bigger effect. For the title of the saga to have \u2018dragon\u2019 in it instead of monster or demon means that all of the power of the saga is concentrated on dragons as a species. It\u2019s more logical for it to show a stronger effect on a real dragon rather than upon\u2026\u2026.subspecies like a sea serpent or a rock serpent.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was the opinion of none other than Odin. Although the saga was a granted power of a world, Asgard, the one that had moulded it and diffused it to the warriors was the King of Gods and the God of magic, Odin.</p><br/><p>Actually, no one could disagree with his opinion as the conclusion came from the one that had the most profound knowledge about the saga.</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn nodded with an admiring expression. it was because he realized that the saga of a title had more meaning than he\u2019d previously thought.</p><br/><p>And that was the same for Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u2018So was it because of that?\u2019</p><br/><p>There were two sagas that belonged to Tae Ho that had changed titles.</p><br/><p>\u2018The Warrior\u2019s Equipment\u2019 and \u2018The One that Controls Dragons\u2019.</p><br/><p>The original name of the two sagas were \u2018Sword of the Warrior\u2019 and \u2018The One that Handles Dragons\u2019, respectively.</p><br/><p>When it was \u2018Sword of the Warrior\u2019, Tae Ho could only recreate weapons with it, but after it became the \u2018Warrior\u2019s Equipment\u2019, Tae Ho was able to also make defensive gear.</p><br/><p>It was the same for \u2018The One That Controls Dragons\u2019. As the one that controls is naturally stronger than the one that handles, the controlling power towards a dragon became stronger.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe title of a saga isn\u2019t created randomly. You could say that the title is a kind of essence that resumes the story behind it.\u201d</p><br/><p>No cases existed that the title of the saga was different to its effect.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe more detailed a title is, the more detailed the effects, but instead, its effects get easier to narrow down. Normally, titles that come in the form of a sentence are such cases. On the other hand, if it\u2019s an abstract title, even if its immediate effects are vague, if you investigate and develop it more, there\u2019s a possibility you may be able to use several abilities at once.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had heard something similar from Ragnar.</p><br/><p>\u2018My saga, \u2018King of Vikings\u2019, or your \u2018Idun\u2019s Warrior\u2019 and \u2018King of Camelot\u2019 are titles that are easy to put anywhere. The reason smaller sagas can be added to my \u2018King of Vikings\u2019 and your \u2018King of Camelot\u2019 is also because of that. This is something that may happen in the future, but \u2018Idun\u2019s Warrior\u2019 may be able to grow into an independent saga that can have smaller sagas within it.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho nodded.</p><br/><p>But Odin opened his only eye sharply while looking at Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u2018Idun\u2019s warrior.\u2019</p><br/><p>The warrior that got called to Valhalla even though he belonged to another world.</p><br/><p>It was rare, but there were precedents of this. Idun and other Gods thought that it was a coincidence that occurred at times, but Odin and Freya thought differently.</p><br/><p>Not a coincidence, but a necessity.</p><br/><p>A result of a work that occurred due to the will of something.</p><br/><p>\u2018The One that Controls Dragons\u2019 was a really strong saga as the user could control dragons, a species that stood at the top rank of predators in any world.</p><br/><p>But Tae Ho had had that kind of saga ever since he\u2019d been a lowest-ranked warrior.</p><br/><p>\u2018If there were several warriors of Idun\u2026..if there were two or three of them.\u2019</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t something he thought suddenly. He had thought of this since he got to know of Tae Ho\u2019s existence.</p><br/><p>But it was also a new thought.</p><br/><p>Because Odin had made several experiments after he\u2019d gotten word of Tae Ho\u2019s existence.</p><br/><p>Odin ordered the God of Messages, Hermod, to forcefully bring the pro gamers to Valhalla.</p><br/><p>The results were pitiful. He had brought about ten pro-gamers, but not even one of them could create a saga.</p><br/><p>The difference between Tae Ho and them was clear.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho was a soul that the system of the world, the system which selected the warriors that would enter Valhalla, had accepted, and the rest of them were souls that Odin had brought forcefully.</p><br/><p>Odin didn\u2019t tell the results of his experiments to anyone.</p><br/><p>In the first place, the only ones that knew the general outline of Tae Ho\u2019s abilities and birth place were Idun and Freya, but the two of them couldn\u2019t even think of forcefully bringing other pro-gamers to Valhalla.</p><br/><p>Because one had to first die to enter it.</p><br/><p>It was impossible for Idun and Freya to think about taking the lives of people that were living a good life just to test the results of something they weren\u2019t certain about. They were too soft to do that.</p><br/><p>Odin organized his thoughts.</p><br/><p>He concentrated again on the current objective and opened his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut our adversary is the black, venomous dragon, Nidhogg. It\u2019s an ancient dragon that accompanied the beginning of the World Tree. Even if you have the power of your saga, it won\u2019t be that easy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut we still have some possibilities. Right, Tae Ho?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho nodded with a bright expression as Cuchulainn spoke energetically. It was rather better to perceive something as positively as possible when they were going to do it anyway.</p><br/><p>Odin put on a faint smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow reliable. And the words of Cuchulainn are right. In the first place, I brought out the name of Nidhogg without taking into account the saga Idun\u2019s warrior has.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there an excellent plan to suppress it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s excellent, but I have a way. Look at this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Odin rolled his fingers and drew a rune at Cuchulainn\u2019s question, and then, a clear image of a dragon appeared in front of Cuchulainn and Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe black dragon, Nidhogg\u2026..It has also been a few hundred years since I last saw it, so it may have gotten bigger in that time, but I made this hologram with what I saw the last time.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a black and huge dragon.</p><br/><p>There were four legs attached to its long, snake-like body and four pair of wings protruding from its back that were each covered with sharp stakes.</p><br/><p>The notion that within its skull were sported a strong jaw and sharp teeth that wouldn\u2019t fall behind to the world wolf\u2019s was heinous enough. The glitter of its eyes resembled fire and made one fall into the essence of fear. The four horns that sprouted from its head seemed capable of piercing the enemy in front of it at any instant.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s entire body was being covered by green fog, but this wasn\u2019t smoke. It was a terrible poison that made even the roots of the World Tree rot.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn gulped after looking at the strong enemy that made him hold his breath by its own and asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cHow big is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was normal for dragons to be tens of meters long in the case of Asgard and Erin.</p><br/><p>Fafnir, that was one of the most famous evil dragons in Asgard, measured a hundred meters.</p><br/><p>But they were talking about Nidhogg. He thought that it may reach two hundred meters as it was an ancient dragon.</p><br/><p>He asked while thinking like that.</p><br/><p>Odin smiled bitterly at Cuchulainn\u2019s question and answered with a calm tone,</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we used the system in the world Idun\u2019s warrior used, from it\u2019s head to the tip of its tail, it would amount to a little more than 2 kilometers in length.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn couldn\u2019t understand Odin\u2019s words instantly. Instead, the one that was shocked was Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>Saying that it was more than 2 kilometers long meant that its head alone was a hundred meters in size.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn-Indeed. It\u2019s a size worthy of an ancient dragon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn understood Odin\u2019s words a bit later and spoke the calmest he could, but he couldn\u2019t completely hide his trembling. It wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to say that it was a moving city if it was 2 kilometers long.</p><br/><p>Odin said once again,</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. You could say that its size is our chance of victory.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a thing that was hard to understand, but Tae Ho nodded and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we just get on its back\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. It won\u2019t be able to attack its enemy directly because of its size.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because for it, Tae Ho\u2019s group would merely be like small insects. It wouldn\u2019t be excessive to say that they weren\u2019t even that visible for the dragon.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut of course, it\u2019s not that there won\u2019t be any dangers. You could say that Nidhogg is a city by itself, and there\u2019s a probability that there may be small and big demons upon its back. And we also can\u2019t ignore the poison emanated from its body, either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho thought of one of the several dungeons he had conquered in Dark Age. One of them was staged on the back of a really huge monster.</p><br/><p>Odin moved his fingers once again, and the part of Nidhogg\u2019s chest was amplified with a cross-section view appearing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe place we will aim for is its heart room that is hidden in the deepest part of its body.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Nidhogg was insanely massive in scale, the heart room was also tens of meters big.</p><br/><p>\u201cInside the heart room is the real body of the dragon\u2026..you could say that it is its essence. If you suppress that essence, you will be able to control all of Nidhogg. I thought that it would resist to your words after it got suppressed, but the story changes with your saga. You can just control it after suppressing it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The situation was different to Adenmaha, who had already had an owner and wanted to get away from them.</p><br/><p>He would have to suppress it like he did with Rolo and McLaren and then use his saga.</p><br/><p>\u2018So I will weaken it and then throw a monster ball.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho understood it in a game-like way and nodded. Cuchulainn, who was next to him, asked again,</p><br/><p>\u201cOdin, are you able to move?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will speak honestly. It seems like I won\u2019t be able to infiltrate Nidhogg with you. My external injuries are too severe to do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were several holes in the body of Odin. They were all the tooth marks of the World Wolf.</p><br/><p>If it was a normal God of Asgard instead of Odin, they would have died on the spot. Actually, it was marvelous enough that they were sharing a conversation like this.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho took out a piece of a golden apple Idun had given him, but Odin shook his head. In the first place, Odin also had a golden apple, but regardless of that, the reason his injuries weren\u2019t able to heal was because they weren\u2019t normal, they had originated from the teeth of the World Wolf.</p><br/><p>The World Wolf was Odin\u2019s natural enemy. It wasn\u2019t excessive to say that it was Odin\u2019s end, a creature that was connected with Odin\u2019s fate.</p><br/><p>Because of that, it wasn\u2019t easy to recover from a wound given by it.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not that I am not able to do anything. I will give strong rune magic and blessings to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave it to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t say anything aside of that in this situation, and Tae Ho was really planning to work with all his strength. He had been suppressing it from before, but he was really worried about Heda. The look of Idun sitting down while clenching her chest passed through his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m grateful that you speak like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Odin answered while forcing a smile and then erased the image of Nidhogg. He waited for the roar that was heard from far away to subside and spoke to Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun\u2019s warrior, you should rest for now. It is a bit sensitive because infiltrators appeared, but night will come soon. I think that it will be good to infiltrate it after it goes to sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although they were in the root of the World Tree that was covered with fog and that seemed like it wouldn\u2019t have night and day, the flow of time still existed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun\u2019s warrior, and Prince of Light-\u201d</p><br/><p>Odin looked at the two of them once again and spoke when they turned to look at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry too much about Idun and Scathach. This may sound a bit irresponsible, but\u2026..there\u2019s still Freya and Heimdall in Asgard. It won\u2019t break down that easily. I believe that is the case.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI also think the same.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho answered immediately. It wasn\u2019t only Freya that remained. There was also the God of Thunder left.</p><br/><p>In addition, Loki would also assist them, so Asgard won\u2019t collapse easily just like Odin had said.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should rest now. I will wake you up when night comes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Odin spoke and closed his eyes first. Tae Ho expressed etiquette and then laid down on the place he had previously been unconscious upon.</p><br/><p>\u2018Heda\u2026..\u2019</p><br/><p>And Idun.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho thought of the faces of the two people and closed his eyes. He then fell in a deep sleep like a lie.</p><br/><p>And while Odin and Tae Ho were asleep, Cuchulainn, who\u2019d been left alone, frowned and mumbled,</p><br/><p>\u201cSo is it a male or a female?\u201d</p><br/><p>The black dragon, Nidhogg.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn turned to look in the direction the roar was heard from.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 37 \u2013 The one that conquers (2) &gt; End</p><hr/><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/>\n</div>"}

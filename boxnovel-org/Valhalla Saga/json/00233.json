It clearly looked like she had been sitting up all night for more than two days but she was still blindingly beautiful with her Brisingamen.</p><br/><p>When Tae HO shrugged his shoulders, Freya grumbled a few more times and then turned to look at everyone Tae Ho brought with him and dropped her shoulders with a sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it should be fine. I already know all of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was obvious that Siri and Bracky would accompany Tae Ho and there was no reason to send back Heda, that was sharing the same body with Idun. The remaining ones were Nidhogg and Adenmaha but the both of them would also be with Tae Ho so with another aspect he had only gathered the members he needed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m asking this because i\u2019m worried but how did the rebirth of Erin go? Did you succeed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, only a part of it but we succeeded clearly.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Tae Ho nodded Freya looked at him from head to toe and then continued speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed, it may be because I heard this but\u2026.your power as the master of Erin has increased. In the first place, the origin of the power of the master is based on his world and the residents. It feels like it was worth having taken care of it even in a hurry.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Gods of Erin obtained power from Erin just like how the Gods of Asgard obtained power from Asgard. If Tae Ho wanted to increase his power as the master of Erin he certainly needed the rebirth of Erin.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho made the group sit down on the seats Freya offered and then asked her, that was burying her body in her throne.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened with Olympus and the Temple?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou heard the general story from Ragnar, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I did hear the general situation but- you must have a more detailed information right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Compared to Ragnar, that had just heard things from others, Freya had the experience of having confronted the enemy directly. In addition, it was not possible that Odin would send her back empty handed.</p><br/><p>Freya nodded and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cI returned from Olympus to Valhalla three days ago. The conclusion Odin-nim and I came to is like it follows.\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya took a deep breath and then spread four fingers.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn Memphis, Maya, Dilmun and Xindu, the beings that want to destroy the world have won. And they got lead by the Kingdom of Fire and have started an invasion.\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that they had turned the beings that wanted to maintain the world into beings that wanted to destroy it like Nyx did. There were some that wanted to maintain among them but if you looked at the bigger picture it was an alliance of only beings that want to destroy the world.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know about the structures of the worlds, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I learned it from Heda.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. Then I will speak with numbers so it\u2019s more comfortable\u2026 Think of it like you are lining up the numbers from 1 to 9 in three lines in groups of three.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are talking about the Telephone Distribution.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho said that while thinking about the number pads in a keyboard and Freya tilted her head at that.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s that but\u2026. whatever the case, if you give them number 1 is Olympus, 2 Asgard, 3 the Temple, 4 Memphis, 5 your hometown Earth, 6 Dilmun, 7 Maya, 8 Avesta, 9 Xindu. You can classificate them like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Circles with numbers in it started to get arranged at the same time as Freya\u2019s voice. The size of each one of them was like the head of a person so it was seen really well.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe rear world\u2026no, we can\u2019t call them like that anymore. Whatever the case, not even we know much about the worlds at the end. It\u2019s normal that there\u2019s no interaction between each world. Asgard, Olympus and the Temple also didn\u2019t have any particular interaction before the destruction of Erin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even Heda knew nothing about the worlds number 7,8,9 besides their names.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhatever the case, the worlds number 4,6,7,8, and 9 fell by the hands of the beings that want to destroy the world. And looking at the structures of the worlds\u2026 they joined the strength of two worlds and invaded Olympus and the Temple.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t invading Earth?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Tae Ho pointed at the 5th world and asked, Freya frowned slightly and answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour world is located at the center of the ten worlds so it\u2019s a bit special. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a movement of a small number of people like your case but it doesn\u2019t have a connecting path.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because of that, they could send a few number of people but it was impossible to invade it full fledgedly.</p><br/><p>Heda, that was listening to the story silently, raised her hand and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cFreya unnie, what is the scale of the forces of the enemy? If my thoughts are right\u2026 even if two worlds formed an alliance I don\u2019t think that it would be enough to overwhelm Olympus or the Temple.\u201d</p><br/><p>She had the appearance of Heda but her attitude treating Freya was closer to Idun. That\u2019s why Freya also treated her as if she was looking at Idun.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun and I think like this. Strictly speaking, the current situation is inflicted by an alliance between beings that want to destroy the world and it\u2019s not the complete power of a world. In addition\u2026 looking that they had won means that a big war comparable to the Great War took place in several worlds. Even if they won, their forces should still be cut down.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was something they could see just by looking at Erin.</p><br/><p>The beings that wanted to maintain the world that got defeated and even the fomoires that had won but lost their strong kings and most of their warriors so someone like Bress had to represent them.</p><br/><p>The giants of Jotunheim hadn\u2019t been able to recover completely from the Great War even after a hundred years.</p><br/><p>Just like Freya had said, the power of Dilmun, Memphis, Maya and Xindu should be greatly weakened.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre there no survivors from the beings that want to maintain the world?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Adenmaha asked carefully, Freya put a benign smile and answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere should probably. There wouldn\u2019t be none. There were also survivors of Erin when the world itself got destroyed. If we stop this attack\u2026 and we go to the offensive it\u2019s highly probable that they will assist us.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seems like they were using Memphis and Dilmun as a foothold to attack that they didn\u2019t get destroyed like Erin. Then, it was highly probable that there were survivors hiding themselves deep in the world.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways, returning to the structures of the world, you should know it if you look at it but the enemy can only attack through the connecting path even if they were lead by the Kingdom of Fire. Currently, the worlds they can attack are only Olympus and the Temple and they are in a difficult situation where it\u2019s hard to attack all at once even if they join strengths from five worlds. We have to use that point in our favour.\u201d</p><br/><p>But it was at that moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cU, um!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg that was aware of her surroundings raised her hand and looked at Freya with earnest eyes. It was the face of a kid with a question.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg flinched as she asked back in an annoyed tone but she got courage and asked Freya.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is the Kingdom of Fire?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone put bitter smiles at the question of Nidhogg. It was because everyone excluding her in this place somewhat knew about the Kingdom of Fire.</p><br/><p>Freya let out a short sigh and then looked at Nidhogg\u2019s eyes and said as if counseling her.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a group that joins the beings that want to destroy the world into one. Following what we know, they have their place at an unknown place called Muspelheim\u2026 and they are a group that support the fomoires of Erin, Jotunheim of Asgard, Kum Oh Do of the Temple, and the Gigantes of Olympus.\u201d</p><br/><p>The biggest reason Asgard and the three worlds thought that they were the front line was because Muspelheim and the Kingdom of Fire were attacking from the north to the south.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut with the current situation, the worlds at the rear-no, at the south should be added to the Kingdom of Fire.\u201d</p><br/><p>The connection between Kum Oh Do, Dilmun and Xindu wasn\u2019t normal. Even if they were beings that wanted to destroy the world, if they didn\u2019t have something that connected them it was hard to react like this altogether.</p><br/><p>They would come down from the north and climb up from the south.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho looked at the north of the number pad and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there no possibility that Muspelheim will attack Asgard directly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course there is. That\u2019s why we can\u2019t take off our forces from the front lines. We have to leave the minimum forces in Asgard.\u201d</p><br/><p>If they attacked in the current situation, there was a high probability they would join the frost giants of Jotunheim.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways, returning back\u2026 you must have already heard this but Olympus is enduring well unexpectedly. The first defensive lines collapsed but it\u2019s only that. They have many strong beings from our side so they aren\u2019t even able to march properly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust like you have said, it seems like the beings that want to destroy the world got really damaged because of the great wars.\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya nodded at Siri\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, there\u2019s also the possibility they are hiding their cards but it seems like they suffered a really big blow just like how the giants of Jotunheim suffered from the Great War. They invaded with the disposition to die together with us and that\u2019s the only thing scary about them, Odin judged that they are opponents that can be faced plentily.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDi, die together?\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya nodded once again as Nidhogg shrugged her shoulders and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, they are beings that want to destroy the world whose final objective is the destruction of the world. The number of remaining worlds is fewer so they must have faced us wanting to die along us.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no concept of conquering or taking over in this war. And that\u2019s why they were all the more difficult to face.</p><br/><p>\u201cRagnar must have told you this but the ones at a disadvantage is the Temple. They ended up getting attacked from the front and from behind thanks to Kum Oh Do. They want Thor but he is at Olympus and Sigurd is in charge of the defenses of the northern region. It\u2019s now time for you to decide.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf i\u2019m going to send Sigurd or i\u2019m going to go myself?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, and actually\u2026 Tyr also went there but looking that they want Thor it\u2019s not something that would be solved only with Sigurd. The actual problem is whether you go or not.\u201d</p><br/><p>The one that had the right to decide was the master of Asgard, Tae Ho. What Freya and Odin could do was to propose things.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho had already finished his thoughts while coming to this place on the Black Flash so he answered immediately.</p><br/><p>\u201cI should go. If the Temple falls, Asgard will be next. The best thing would be to end the battle in the Temple.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, i\u2019m sorry for the Temple but we can\u2019t expand the battlefield to Asgard. The best thing is to end it there.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the story proceeded up to this point Siri asked once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cFreya-nim. The return of Odin-nim and Thor-nim isn\u2019t scheduled yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot for now. They are planning on staying at Olympus until the mainland of Asgard gets invaded. I said that the situation in Olympus was good but the reason of that is because Odin and Thor are over there. If the two of them fall back it would be hard for Olympus to endure.\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya spoke up to that point. She then gulped dry saliva and explained while pointing at the number pad.</p><br/><p>\u201cOdin\u2019s plan is like this. While Olympus and the Temple are resisting at the brink of death, Tae Ho will bring a guerilla unit and cut down the heads of the enemies. If the situation in the Temple improves like that you will protect Olympus after that and then counterattack.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a strategy she could set up because she believed in Tae Ho that had become stronger than Thor and Heracles.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe hadn\u2019t gone out to attack earnestly because of the damages we would suffer but\u2026 now that it became like this we can also only conduct an attack. If the defense ends at some point you will invade Muspelheim directly and cut the connection of the Kingdom of Fire. This is Odin\u2019s thoughts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd Avesta?\u201d</p><br/><p>The one that asked was Heda. Freya dropped her shoulders and answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt will be after Muspelheim. Or you will battle with them while Olympus and the Temple are defending. But it\u2019s only a general outline of the plan.\u201d</p><br/><p>They still lacked information about their enemy. They had to see a bit more how Muspelheim and Avesta were going to move.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt will certainly be a difficult war. But after this war ends and we win in it, a long time of peace will come. I\u2019m sure of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her eyes and tone of the voice became quite earnest at the end parts. Tae Ho grinned unconsciously and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you going to retire then?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would I retire? I have to exert my authority as much as I suffered. But only\u2026 i\u2019m not planning on doing anything grandiose. I\u2019m just planning on living lovey dovey.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWith whom?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Tae Ho smirked, Heda opened her eyes sharply and Freya flushed in a way that was hard to see and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I don\u2019t know. Anyways, if you also want to marry and live merrily peace has to come so you should work hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnnie, isn\u2019t the conclusion too weird?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so everyone eats and lives well. What?\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya grinned in her throne and shrugged her shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways, you are going to depart after two days. You should have plenty of rest before that. You don\u2019t know when you may be able to rest when the battle starts so if you have something you have to do, do it now and don\u2019t regret it later. Understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya winked and then shut her mouth like she had nothing else to say and looked at Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho smiled bitterly and then looked at Heda once and said while looking at Freya once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cFreya-nim, I agree earnestly on your words\u2026but there\u2019s something I have to do with Freya-nim before that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, you still need more meetings?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s better the more I have\u2026but it\u2019s something else.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho endured Heda\u2019s and Adenmaha\u2019s cold eyes and smiled by force and Freya tilted her head but then clapped her hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda was the one to ask but not Tae Ho or Freya answered her. Freya rolled her hair and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt must be possible. It won\u2019t only be hard on me but also on you\u2026.and Heda but it should be that worth it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFreya unnie?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAsk your dear husband about the details.\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya grinned and then looked at Tae Ho again.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you going to depart now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt would be best to hurry.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were going to go to the Temple after two days but actually it was better the faster they went.</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho master, where are you going? Can\u2019t Nidhogg also go with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg grabbed Tae Ho\u2019s sleeve and asked. Adenmaha smiled without any words and Tae Ho stroke her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cNidhogg will also come with us.\u201d</p><br/><p>No, she had to.</p><br/><p>And it was at that moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda opened her eyes widely and Adenmaha nodded from behind. While Siri and Bracky were looking at each other because they didn\u2019t know what they were talking about, Tae Ho laughed and answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what you are thinking about.\u201d</p><br/><p>The last thing they had to finish en Asgard now that they had reborn Erin.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho looked at Nidhogg again. He pinched her cheek lightly as she tilted her head and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go meet Ratatoskr.\u201d</p><br/><p>To return to the roots of the World tree.</p><br/><p>To regain the real power of Nidhogg that was asleep at that place.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg blinked at Tae Ho\u2019s words and then smiled brightly and answered.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 66 \u2013 The Kingdom of fire (2) &gt; End</p><hr/><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It didn\u2019t even have one.</p><br/><p>If you wanted to speak about it there was a need to explain the general background of Dark Age.</p><br/><p>The strongest race in Dark Age were the dragons.</p><br/><p>It was an existence that could exist by its own and that\u2019s why they were called as the only kings, and each possessed strength equivalent to Gods.</p><br/><p>Because of that the strongest race were the dragons even if you saw them individually or as an entire race.</p><br/><p>The dragons didn\u2019t have groups. Each of them ruled over their territory as expected of their nickname, the only kings.</p><br/><p>But everything changed when he appeared.</p><br/><p>The fierce king Eidra.</p><br/><p>He had outstanding strength even among the dragons and was an existence that could be called as the God of dragons.</p><br/><p>He was the one that had the belief that they should use all the other races as dragons as the kings of the worlds, the strongest races of dragons.</p><br/><p>Countless dragons agreed to his ideals. There were a minority that didn\u2019t but they couldn\u2019t resist in front of Edira\u2019s power.</p><br/><p>Eidra conquered the world in an instant and the dark age arrived.</p><br/><p>But there were still little stars in the pitch black sky.</p><br/><p>The several Gods of their races stood up for their race. They transmitted strength to stand up to Eidra.</p><br/><p>The several jobs in Dark Age was born like that.</p><br/><p>The warriors received the blessing of the God of orcs and the God of war Karak Durga, and the archers received the blessing of the God of hunt and werewolves, Emeldra. The number of jobs receiving the blessings of the race Gods easily surpassed twenty.</p><br/><p>And a small minority of them, the ones that had obtained extreme accomplishments in their jobs awakened the ancient power sleeping in their blood and could become more special beings.</p><br/><p>The dragon knight was a class that got awakened like that.</p><br/><p>All the dragon knights received a revelation the moment they woke up. And the one that sent down that revelation was the real God of dragons, World dragon Yggdrasil.</p><br/><p>The dragon knights could use the power of dragons thanks to its blessing and a minority of them became existences that even surpassed dragons.</p><br/><p>Because of that, you could say that all the dragon knights were believers of the World dragon Yggdrasil and its knights.</p><br/><p>But not everyone was the same. World dragon Yggdrasil only had one real knight.</p><br/><p>The incarnation of the World dragon.</p><br/><p>The one that executed the force of the World dragon.</p><br/><p>The one that received its order to execute the fallen dragons.</p><br/><p>That was the Knight of World Dragon.</p><br/><p>It was the title of the strongest dragon knight Kalsted.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>Tae Ho raised his head.</p><br/><p>Now that he had transformed into the incarnation of the World dragon, it wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to say that he was a dragon with the appearance of a human.</p><br/><p>But he wasn\u2019t a normal dragon.</p><br/><p>Dragon Vane.</p><br/><p>The executor that killed countless dragons.</p><br/><p>The dark blue divinity certainly belonged to the master of Asgard. It was made up with the power of the God of battle and conquer.</p><br/><p>But it didn\u2019t end there. A strong dragon killing aura was filling up that divinity.</p><br/><p>Actually it wasn\u2019t complete yet. it was because he needed the dragon sword Astellone, that was the other incarnation, to become the real incarnation of the World dragon.</p><br/><p>But he didn\u2019t lack anything.</p><br/><p>It was enough with how he was.</p><br/><p>The children of Echidna woke up from their faint. It was because the nasty dragon killer aura took off even their freedom to be passed out.</p><br/><p>The children of Echidna laid down and suffered while groaning.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha looked at Tae Ho\u2019s back and gulped dry saliva. She knew that Tae Ho\u2019s strength was protecting her and everyone else but even so she couldn\u2019t help but tremble.</p><br/><p>She thought of the moment she faced the strongest dragon killer of Asgard, Sigurd. No, it wasn\u2019t only that. The aura Tae Ho was releasing was much stronger.</p><br/><p>Drakon Ismenios cried and praised Tae HO\u2019s strength even while trembling in fear and pain. Nidhogg breathed roughly as if it was uncomfortable to breathe and sat down. Perhaps you got influenced more the stronger dragon you were.</p><br/><p>Hydra laid down and didn\u2019t move. No, it seemed like she couldn\u2019t do anything.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha gulped dry saliva. Even the ones getting protected by Tae Ho were like this. Then, what would happen to the ones facing him directly?</p><br/><p>Adenmaha looked up at Echidna. She had released her red aura as an ancient dragon to face the dark blue aura but she didn\u2019t show the same leisure as before. She was also groaning in the middle of her fear and pain.</p><br/><p>A natural enemy.</p><br/><p>A dragon specialized other dragons.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho extended his hand. He grabbed Caliburn in his right hand and the shield of Achilles in his left.</p><br/><p>He then spread his wings of light and flew up.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha gulped dry saliva. She looked at Echidna while holding her hands that trembled out of nervousness.</p><br/><p>Echidna was looking at Tae Ho and at some point she retrieved her red aura that was facing Tae Ho\u2019s aura.</p><br/><p>\u201cI surrender. I lost. I don\u2019t want to fight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Echidna returned to her Goddess form and raised her arms. She had given up so quickly it bewildered Adenmaha.</p><br/><p>But it was different for Tae Ho. It was because he had expected the situation to flow like this to some extent.</p><br/><p>It was the same for Cuchulainn.</p><br/><p>\u2018Echidna didn\u2019t even want to fight from the beginning.\u2019</p><br/><p>She clearly had strength but she didn\u2019t enjoy fighting.</p><br/><p>In the first place, this battle hadn\u2019t happened because she wanted.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho\u2019s group attacked Echidna and her children when they were living peaceful and the children of Echidna just attacked back in defense.</p><br/><p>But of course, it was hard to say that Echidna was Tae Ho\u2019s enemy as she was a being wanting to maintain the world but in her position she was being dragged forcefully to the battlefield along her children. It wasn\u2019t illogical to resist.</p><br/><p>\u2018He even denied my proposal.\u2019</p><br/><p>Echidna\u2019s field of interest was to give birth to strong children. That\u2019s why she had proposed Tae Ho to make some children as well as to avoid the current situation but Tae Ho had denied her bluntly. That\u2019s why the only option she had left was to use all her force to chase away the perpetrators.</p><br/><p>But even that hadn\u2019t worked. The perpetrators were just too strong.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why fight if I can\u2019t even win? The objective of the opponent isn\u2019t even to exterminate us.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho had only knocked out her children and didn\u2019t kill them. He also wasn\u2019t planning to kill Echidna herself.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why she would just surrender and save her forces. She would prevent a situation where someone could die.</p><br/><p>This was Echidna\u2019s judgement and it was what Tae Ho and Cuchulainn hoped for.</p><br/><p>But Tae Ho didn\u2019t remove his state of the \u2018incarnation of the world dragon\u2019. He looked at Echidna and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a battle for Olympus and for Asgard and the nine realms. I hope you and your children assist us.\u201d</p><br/><p>He spoke as the master of Asgard and it was also his sincerity.</p><br/><p>Actually, Tae Ho wasn\u2019t comfortable at the current situation. It was also atrocious when he looked at his doings.</p><br/><p>But it was a necessity. Tae Ho looked at Echidna with serious eyes and she frowned slightly and shrugged her shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t do anything about it. Fine, I will do that. It seems like we have quite a lot of chances to win compared to the start so I will bet on you.\u201d</p><br/><p>She even smiled brightly in the end. Her way of speaking had also gotten more comfortable compared to the beginning.</p><br/><p>Actually, there was some difference in Echidna\u2019s overlooking and Hraesvelgr\u2019s overlooking.</p><br/><p>If Hraesvelgr had just been silent in the highest branch to protect it, Echidna was curling down as she didn\u2019t knwo what to do.</p><br/><p>The current Olympus actually belonged to the Gods that had turned into beings wanting to destroy the world.</p><br/><p>There were still some Gods that remained as beings wanting to maintain the world but most of them had suffered great injuries or got really weakened because their sacred force got robbed from them.</p><br/><p>What could Echidna do in this situation aside of curling down?</p><br/><p>In addition, she and her children got attacked by the Gods and heroes of Olympus because of the simple reason that they were monsters.</p><br/><p>For her the Gods of Olympus were beings that were hard to make an alliance with whether they were beings wanting to destroy or maintain the world.</p><br/><p>\u2018The one that killed Ares is Idun\u2019s warrior.\u2019</p><br/><p>Echidna could also be certain of it now. That\u2019s why she could see their prospects to win a bit higher.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho let out a short sigh of relief as Echidna agreed obediently. But it hadn\u2019t ended completely yet. The words above Echidna\u2019s head had only changed from red to grey, it wasn\u2019t green yet.</p><br/><p>It certainly seemed like only an agreement wouldn\u2019t be enough.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for answering. But\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho paused the last part of the sentence and then flew softly in front of Echidna by moving his wings. He faced her head on and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the last stage. Take me in, Echidna.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho raised his head. Echidna glanced at Tae Ho\u2019s hands and Hydra looking at them from far away and then smirked and answered with a bewitching voice as if trying to seduce him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo it gently, it\u2019s my first time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Every movement of hers was enough to shake the hearts of the ones that were watching but it didn\u2019t work on Tae Ho. His blinded love had even fended back against the seduction of the Goddess of beauty.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will start.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho placed his hand on Echidna\u2019s forehead. Echidna closed her eyes slowly and Tae Ho activated his saga.</p><br/><p>[Saga: The one that conquers dragons]</p><br/><p>Echidna didn\u2019t reject Tae Ho like she promised. She took Tae Ho\u2019s control obediently.</p><br/><p>[Ancient dragon]</p><br/><p>[Goddess of dragons]</p><br/><p>[The mother of all monsters]</p><br/><p>[Tae Ho\u2019s dragon]</p><br/><p>[Echidna]</p><br/><p>The grey words changed into a clear green.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho pulled his hand back slowly and Echidna turned to look at herself with a languid face.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey all passed over?\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t only Echidna. Tae Ho put on a sorry face and looked at the entire cave.</p><br/><p>There were green words everywhere he looked. The green words were clear even on the children of Echidna that hadn\u2019t participated in the battle.</p><br/><p>\u2018We passed over one trial.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn let out a long sigh and said. But it wasn\u2019t done yet. He still had something he had to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not something we should hurry but it\u2019s good if we finish it in one try.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Is there something left?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Echidna tilted her head and asked, Tae Ho glanced at Adenmaha and then spoke in a low voice and Echidna put on a confused face at his words but then nodded.</p><br/><p>She cleared her throat and then said.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a meeting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Nasty bastard.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn said and Tae Ho put on a satisfied smile.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 57 \u2013 The mother of all monsters (2) &gt; End</p><br/>\n</div>"}

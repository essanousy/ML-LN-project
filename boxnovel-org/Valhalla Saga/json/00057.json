He worked hard to execute the several techniques in reality that Kalsted had used in the world of Dark Age.</p><br/><p>Ragnar and Heda helped him. Cu Chulainn also grabbed some important points and advised him.</p><br/><p>Kalsted\u2019s sword that was completed inside the saga.</p><br/><p>He had vaguely followed up. The synchro rate had increased up to 32%</p><br/><p>[Saga: The warrior\u2019s equipment]</p><br/><p>What Tae Ho was grabbing was the Sword of a winter wolf.</p><br/><p>It was a sword that had strong magic engraved in it which he acquired after killing the three troll brothers and conquering Giant Hill.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho executed Kalsted\u2019s sword. Instead of slashing the fomoires that were like rock with his sword, he aimed for the knots that connected the rocks. He slashed the fomoires as quickly and naturally as water. His superhuman physique that had reached the intermediate level and the polished sword techniques of Kalsted made that capable.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>The fomoires fell to the ground and cried. The fomoires couldn\u2019t catch up to Tae Ho that had become dull thanks to the snowstorm. They just got swept by the sword.</p><br/><p>\u201cCaptain Siri!\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri was already getting out of the cave when he yelled. Catching the ones that had escaped was her role.</p><br/><p>Siri pulled out the big crossbow she was carrying on her back and fired quickly. The arrows that were added with the strength of the saga hit 100 out of 100 times, but there were too many fomoires. Siri charged the eight arrow after having killed seven of the escaping fomoires and perceived. The last one had already fled too far. Even if she hit it, there was a high possibility for the arrow to get bounced off.</p><br/><p>Babang!</p><br/><p>A loud sound exploded in the cave. Siri ground her teeth and turned around. And just like expected, she saw Tae Ho that was breathing roughly.</p><br/><p>Siri opened her mouth that didn\u2019t want to open with a sorry face and Tae Ho shook his head. Just looking at the seven fomoires that were on the floor he could realize that it wasn\u2019t Siri\u2019s fault. It was unavoidable.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hurry up.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cu Chulainn said in a low voice. He could feel that he was pressing down the uneasiness the most he could.</p><br/><p>\u2018Go to the treasury of the Red branch knights. There\u2019s an object suitable for transportation. You will be able to arrive faster than when riding on your ally.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho hurriedly made a hand gesture to Siri. After they returned to the cave again, he got led by Cu Chulainn and opened the secret door of the treasury.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Flashy and colorful words shined. The golden words especially blinded him because there were too much.</p><br/><p>As Tae Ho raised his hand to reflexively cover himself as if covering from the sunlight, Siri looked at him as if asking what he was doing.</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are a lot of treasures.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho evaded Siri\u2019s gaze that had turned a bit warm and then looked inside the treasury. There were many weapons swords, spears and shields but there were alo several precious metals like pure gold and jewels.</p><br/><p>\u2018Because someday\u2026Erin was planning on making the second Ulster.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn said in a bitter voice. He was filled with prostration as if he had thought about his allies of the Red branch knights.</p><br/><p>\u2018The thing you should take is the boat over there.\u2019</p><br/><p>[Sgaba Tune]</p><br/><p>It was a long boat that didn\u2019t have a sail and was like a canoe. It didn\u2019t seem that different to the boat that was in Idun\u2019s legion.</p><br/><p>\u2018It has no sail and oar but its a magical boat that moves automatically. It will be able to fly over the plains as if its slipping. You can also regulate the size so order it to get smaller.\u2019</p><br/><p>When he placed his hands on it like Cuchulainn had told him, the boat became small like a toy. It seemed to be similar to the magical boat Skidbladnir, that he had heard once from Idun.</p><br/><p>Idun took some more treasures that seemed useful and then left the treasury. He could always return at a later time, so he could retrieve the treasures at a later time.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hurry up.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn said again. You could now feel anxiousness in him.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho hurried up and thought. He was sure that he would also be in a hurry if Heda was in a dangerous situation, but Scathach was none other than Cuchulainn\u2019s master. He was sure that she would be really powerful.</p><br/><p>\u2018That\u2019s not the case. Master is more of a teacher than a warrior. She\u2019s more specialized in teaching.\u2019</p><br/><p>Although she certainly had some strength, she wasn\u2019t that strong like Tae Ho had imagined her to be.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn thought of the first time he met Scathach. It was a ridiculous first meeting that was about him sneaking into her bedroom and threatened her that he would kill her if she didn\u2019t teach him.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn shared his thoughts because he wasn\u2019t in a good condition and Tae Ho asked unconsciously. They were lovers and other things but their first meeting was that dramatic.</p><br/><p>\u2018I, I was small back then.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn said with a bewildered voice.</p><br/><p>Although you couldn\u2019t forgive someone having threatened you after sneaking in to your bedroom for being young, Tae Ho just nodded for now.</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Siri asked as if there was something wrong, Cuchulainn cleared his throat and begged him to keep quiet about this. And Tae Ho also promised to keep it a secret.</p><br/><p>\u2018Thanks to that I was able to calm down.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn became a bit calmer than before. Tae Ho placed down Sgaba Tune outside the cave and thought.</p><br/><p>Although he couldn\u2019t know for how long the fomoires were hiding in ambush, he could vaguely know how obsessed they were. They couldn\u2019t be in too much of a hurry but it was certainly a situation they should hurry.</p><br/><p>\u2018Master is in Nidavelir. I will be the one to control it so place Gae Bolg to Sgaba Tune.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho got on the boat and placed Gae Bolg at the front of the boat. Siri released a magical bird, that was provided when you became an intermediate ranked warrior, before getting on the boat. It was to notice Gandur the news the fastest they could.</p><br/><p>Sgaba Tune departed. Their destination was Nidavelir, the world of the dwarves.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>Just like the giants in Jotunheim, the Fomoires also had several kings.</p><br/><p>The tyrant Brass, that was born between the Tuatha De Danann and a fomoire, opened its eye sharply and looked at a far place.</p><br/><p>It had already passed a hundred years since Erin got destroyed. And in that time Bress and the fomoires had reduced in numbers.</p><br/><p>What the fomoires wanted wasn\u2019t the destruction of Erin. What they truly wanted was to take over Erin and rule it.</p><br/><p>However it was too late. The king of Muspelheim, Surtr, destroyed Erin with his flames. Erin didn\u2019t exist anymore.</p><br/><p>Because of that the fomoires got obsessed with the survivors of Erin.Because they were the only ones that could fill their empty conquering greed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Scathach.\u2019</p><br/><p>The queen of the land of darkness. The witch that raised not only that exalted Cuchulainn but also several other heroes.</p><br/><p>A new flame surged up in Bress, that was almost cooling down and becoming ash.</p><br/><p>Nidavelir.</p><br/><p>Bress burst out of laughter. He expressed joy and amazement in the same time.</p><br/><p>It was good news that it was far away from Asgard for the fomoires. There were several of their race in that place that Scathach was said to be.</p><br/><p>She really was Scathach, the shadow witch. She had hidden really well.</p><br/><p>Bress rose his body from the throne made of rocks.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>Sgaba Tune was really fast.After they passed the boundary connecting Svartalfheim and Nidavelir, the sky turned white from being black. Siri opened her eyes widely as if it was marvelous.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a white night. Master\u2019s words were true.\u201d</p><br/><p>The snowstorm that was falling until now also stopped like a lie. It seemed like they would turn blind because of the white scenery.</p><br/><p>The dwarves of Nidavelir all lived underground. Because of that you could say that the real Nidavelir was underground.</p><br/><p>However Cuchulainn and Tae Ho had something to do above ground.</p><br/><p>\u2018We are almost there. We are not that far.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho!\u201d</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn and Siri spoke at the same time. Tae Ho looked at the location Siri pointed at and ground his teeth.</p><br/><p>Fomoires of various shapes were flying in the sky. They were certainly moving in the same direction as Tae Ho\u2019s group.</p><br/><p>In addition they weren\u2019t the only ones. After looking a bit farther he could see fomoires that had already arrived. They were attacking the place that was in between the boundary of the white night and black night.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn thought of Scathach that was in the land of darkness. He was sure that the thing was similar to the fortress that was being protected by a wall you couldn\u2019t see.</p><br/><p>The fomoires were a bit faster. Just counting them roughly they were more than a hundred. It wasn\u2019t a number Tae Ho and Siri could face alone.</p><br/><p>However Sgaba Tune didn\u2019t stop. Siri looked at a far place with the eyes of a hunter as if looking for her prey.</p><br/><p>It was then. A huge existence crossed the white plains and appeared. The thing that had surged up by charging forward was really white and beautiful.</p><br/><p>\u2018Adenmaha!\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn said in shock. He could only do so. It wasn\u2019t only because Cuchulainn knew its name.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s the servant of the Tyrant Bress. It\u2019s a strong sea dragon that can move freely anywhere that has water.\u2019</p><br/><p>The fact that Adenmaha had appeared meant that the army that was in front of them was sent by the Tyrant Bress.</p><br/><p>However Tae Ho paid attention to another thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cDragon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are talking about a dragon?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho and Siri said at the same time. The two of them looked at Gae Bolg as if they were going to devour it and Cuchulainn answered in his bewilderment.</p><br/><p>\u2018That\u2019s right. Precisely speaking it\u2019s a sea serpent, but it does belong to the dragon category.\u2019</p><br/><p>That was enough. Tae Ho nodded and Siri transformed into a golden wolf after smiling sharply.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho rode on that Siri and activated the \u2018eyes of the dragon\u2019. It was just like Cuchulainn had said.</p><br/><p>[The poor servant of the Tyrant Bress]</p><br/><p>[White Adenmaha]</p><br/><p>[Sea serpent(Dragon race)]</p><br/><p>\u2018Why are they like that? Is it different if its a dragon?\u2019</p><br/><p>It was obvious for Cuchulainn to not know. Because he hasn\u2019t always been with Tae Ho. He didn\u2019t know much about Tae Ho before they met.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is different.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBy a lot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho and Siri said in consecution. Tae Ho glared at Adenmaha instead of explaining anymore and got ready.</p><br/><p>[Saga: The hammer of the blacksmith doesn\u2019t slip off]</p><br/><p>[The shining Hunter\u2019s rope]</p><br/><p>[The Beast\u2019s saddle that covers you comfortably]</p><br/><p>[The suppression reins that has the love of Idun]</p><br/><p>And the last one.</p><br/><p>Just like what happened with \u2018the sword of the warrior\u2019, the moment the synchro rate reached 32% Tae Ho\u2019s saga improved one more step.</p><br/><p>[Saga: The one that controls dragons]</p><br/><p>Controlling instead of handling. Kalsted\u2019s saga that shows a particularly strong power when used against the dragon race.</p><br/><p>Siri, that had Tae Ho on her back, jumped down the boat. Tae Ho made Siri faster with the strength of his saga.</p><br/><p>The fomoires discovered Tae Ho and Siri. The Adenmaha, that was about to fire an ice breath towards the invisible barrier also turned to look at Tae Ho and Siri.</p><br/><p>He saw one warrior riding a small but beautiful wolf. Compared to the fomoires surrounding Scathach\u2019s fortress, they were really unshapely.</p><br/><p>However Adenmaha trembled unconsciously. The warrior and the wolf smiling while looking at it was really shivering.</p><br/><p>What was it? What do they want to do?</p><br/><p>Adenmaha breathed out for now. But it didn\u2019t work at all. Siri got accompanied with thunder and storm and charged over with an amazing speed and passed it from below. She kept running like that to jump over the fomoires and then she got on top of Adenmaha.</p><br/><p>At the same time Tae Ho jumped down from Siri. Although it was huge it was a normal sea serpent- He ran on the neck of the Adenmaha, that had a long neck, long body and long tail, and reached its head in an instant.</p><br/><p>\u201cChant!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho transformed into a hawk. Adenmaha shook its head to try to shake off Tae Ho but it got bewildered once more and Tae Ho transformed into a human once again in the air and threw the wide Hunter\u2019s rope.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha\u2019s neck got caught in it. Tae Ho kicked the air to stick to its neck and after taking out the Beast\u2019s saddle he activated the \u2018one that controls dragons\u2019. In addition he threw the suppression reins he received from Idun in the last expedition. The magical reins got big by its own and hooked Adenmaha\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho inserted more strength in the \u2018one that controls dragons\u2019 once again. And then, something that shocked even Cuchulainn occurred.</p><br/><p>[The really bewildered]</p><br/><p>[The one that has changed owners]</p><br/><p>[White Adenmaha]</p><br/><p>While Siri was smiling while growling, the ice breath of the Adenmaha fell down in the heads of the fomoires.</p><br/><p>&lt; Intermediate Ranked Warrior (2) &gt; End</p><hr/><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The spear was a weapon used by a son of the God of war and a God of defeat so it wouldn\u2019t be a normal weapon.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hey, just throw it away. It\u2019s unlucky to have a weapon of a God of defeat. You aren\u2019t even lacking in weapons. You have Gae Bolg especially, Gae Bolg.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn complained as if he really disliked it but Tae Ho was still planning on taking it.</p><br/><p>\u2018Everything has its uses. If it\u2019s a really unlucky object I will give it to the enemy so a curse falls on them.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was quite logical.</p><br/><p>But it seemed like that wasn\u2019t the case for Cuchulainn. No, it seemed like he was rather bewildered at Tae Ho for having thought of such thing.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hey, just how do you think of something that wicked? Did all the people in your previous world think like that?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s wasteful to leave it. Let\u2019s take it even if we won\u2019t use it.\u2019</p><br/><p>He was still a God so he wouldn\u2019t use an ordinary spear. It was also obvious that the material of the spear wouldn\u2019t be normal so he was planning to disassemble it and use it as ingredients if it came to be.</p><br/><p>Bracky saw Tae Ho heading to the spear of Deimos and then put on an expression as if he was looking at a really ideal warrior of Valhalla and then turned to the direction Phobos\u2019 corpse was at.</p><br/><p>\u201cI should also take this. The axe he swung should be perfect for throwing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bracky approached the corpse of Phobos and took the axe for himself. Holding it had a good feeling to it as expected of a weapon being used by a God of war. The distribution of its weight was also excellent so it was perfect to be used as a throwing weapon.</p><br/><p>Bracky lightly threw it up and caught it as if handling a toy and then put it in his waist and checked the corpse of Phobos.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh, the armor is impossible right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Phobos was also quite tall but he was still really small compared to the giant Bracky.</p><br/><p>Siri approached him and shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt clearly is impossible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even if it did fit him, he didn\u2019t want to wear it particularly. It was because the armor was a mess as much as Phobos\u2019 corpse was in a pitiful state.</p><br/><p>But Bracky still smacked his lips as if it was regretful.</p><br/><p>\u201cI need new pants. It was always like this in Midgard. Others could take away things from others but I always had to make things new because nothing fit me.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had a really complicated expression.</p><br/><p>He even dropped his shoulders like a kid that got wounded because only he couldn\u2019t do something others could do.</p><br/><p>Siri looked up at that Bracky and then turned her gaze away and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s a pair of pants\u2026.should I make one for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>She had never boasted about it but needlework was one of her strong points.</p><br/><p>She could obviously do simple needlework because she had to take care of her younger brother and she could also weave cloth to make some clothes.</p><br/><p>Bracky smiled brightly at Siri\u2019s proposal.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? You are going to make some underwear for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, didn\u2019t you say pants?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat I really need is underwear. You know the size well, right? Ak! Why!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bracky got angry as he got his shin kicked. Siri checked her surroundings with a red face and then hit his other shin.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet hit some more if you don\u2019t know why.\u201d</p><br/><p>She had hit him rather strongly but Bracky\u2019s shin was like a solid log. No matter how strong she hit him, it was only seen as playing.</p><br/><p>\u2018They are a storybook couple.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn clicked his tongue. Tae Ho couldn\u2019t see his face but he could imagine the expression he must have.</p><br/><p>\u2018Right.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho was looking at Siri and Bracky with lukewarm eyes instead of Cuchulainn.</p><br/><p>But it seemed like Cuchulainn also didn\u2019t like that.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hey, do you know what conscience is? How can you of all people be like this?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Why?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Leave it. Just die if you don\u2019t know. Anyways, i\u2019m saying this just in case but don\u2019t say you will take underwear from others and wear it yourself. You still have many that Heda and Adenmaha made for you.\u2019</p><br/><p>Heda was proficient not only in cooking but in several other fields. Adenmaha was slightly inferior to Heda in regards of cooking but there was almost nothing she couldn\u2019t do, starting from cleaning to needleworking.</p><br/><p>Even the clothes Nidhogg was wearing was almost made by Adenmaha entirely.</p><br/><p>\u2018I am obsessed on looting but I won\u2019t take the underwear of others.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Even if it\u2019s an underwear made with dragon leather?\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho couldn\u2019t answer immediately and Cuchulainn laughed.</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t keep exchanging jokes forever. Tae Ho approached the spear and activated the \u2018eyes of the dragon\u2019.</p><br/><p>[Spear of crushing defeat]</p><br/><p>\u2018That guy was also nasty. How could he want to use a weapon like that?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s still a white gold ranked weapon.\u2019</p><br/><p>The shaft of the spear was also made of gold but it was really light and had a good elasticity. It seemed like it wasn\u2019t a normal metal.</p><br/><p>\u2018Merlin should be fine, right?\u2019</p><br/><p>He naturally thought of Merlin while thinking of melting down the spear to use it as a material.</p><br/><p>\u2018He should be as he is in Idun\u2019s residence. Master should also be fine.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn answered in a low voice. His voice was the same as usual but it had grief he couldn\u2019t hide.</p><br/><p>He must have lacked time to be with Scathach just like it was for Tae Ho and Heda.</p><br/><p>The time given after the battle with the Magician King was really short.</p><br/><p>But Cuchulainn didn\u2019t add more words in vian. He calmed down his emotions by smirking and Tae Ho acted the same way as him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWarriors of Valhalla.\u201d</p><br/><p>Athena\u2019s voice was heard right then. Tae Ho hurriedly took the spear and approached her and Bracky and Siri also stopped joking and followed Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have to get out of here. Ares doesn\u2019t only have those two children. We have to hurry and join with Apollo\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Athena started speaking slowly but then paused and closed her eyes. Tae Ho looked at Adenmaha hurriedly and she answered calmly.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine. She\u2019s only asleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t hurt greatly?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bracky asked in a low voice. Adenmaha\u2019s expression darkened.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe has so many wounds there\u2019s no part whole. In addition, she must also be mentally exhausted\u2026she won\u2019t be able to wake up for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>They hadn\u2019t been able to witness Deimos and Phobos hitting her but they could imagine it just by looking at the wounds in her body.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will leave Athena-nim to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my specialty. Leave her to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha smiled brightly. It was a smile that put you in a good mood just by looking at it.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m always grateful to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph. Plain words.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha stuck out her tongue but then grumbled to make him hear her on purpose. Tae Ho smiled once again at her lovely sight and Cuchulainn let out a sigh.</p><br/><p>\u2018Stop the corny things and lets return. Ares would have also sensed that his children died.\u2019</p><br/><p>In addition, Deimos and Phobos weren\u2019t simple children but were also Ares\u2019 lesser Gods. It was obvious he sensed their deaths.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho nodded and then looked up the sky and grabbed a summoning rock.</p><br/><p>\u201cRolo!\u201d</p><br/><p>A gryphon that was putting on an unsatisfactory face appeared at his call.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha, who was closer to Rolo than Tae Ho, put on a teary face.</p><br/><p>\u201cRolo, you have suffered too much. Your face got so thin.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed like he had really suffered in that hour of flight.</p><br/><p>But it seemed that it was only seen like that for Adenmaha that Bracky and Siri tilted their heads. Actually, Rolo\u2019s face was covered with white feathers so it was hard to differentiate if he was thin or fat.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s work hard one more time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho smiled bitterly at Rolo who glanced at him and activated his saga.</p><br/><p>[Saga: Master of flames]</p><br/><p>Rolo transformed into Shootingstar and carried the group in his back. He placed Adenmaha carrying Athena on the Beast\u2019s saddle and then spoke to Siri who was lying down in a suitable place.</p><br/><p>\u201cCaptain Siri, I will leave it to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready. We can depart at any time.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was speaking about the stealth blessing. Actually, it was hard to hide themselves completely even if they had the stealth blessing as Rolo would be flying at extremely fast speeds. But it would still be better than nothing.</p><br/><p>\u201cAdenmaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI finished installing the barrier.\u201d</p><br/><p>An invisible hemisphere was installed at Rolo\u2019s back. It was to block the wind rather than stopping the enemies attacks.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho placed his hands on Rolo\u2019s back when Ullr\u2019s blessing covered Adenmaha\u2019s barrier.</p><br/><p>[Strengthened saga: The charge of the warrior is like a storm]</p><br/><p>[Strengthened saga: The one that conquers dragons]</p><br/><p>Gale and thunder started to gather around Rolo\u2019s wings when he flew to a high place. Rolo\u2019s wings, that were strengthened by the \u2018one that conquers dragons\u2019 pushed the wing strongly.</p><br/><p>But it wasn\u2019t the end yet. Tae Ho took a deep breath and activated one more saga.</p><br/><p>[Saga: The warrior that rode on a Goddess]</p><br/><p>The result of the evolution of \u2018The warrior that rode on a Valkyrie\u2019.</p><br/><p>There was nothing new as \u2018The warrior that rode on a Valkyrie\u2019 was also a mounting saga.</p><br/><p>But something had changed now.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha, who was the one that experienced the saga the most and was the one that promoted it to \u2018the one that rode on a Goddess\u2019 noticed the difference instinctively.</p><br/><p>\u201cRolo?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was different than usual. There was something essential that had changed other than simply being strengthened.</p><br/><p>[Idun\u2019s Valkyrie (Temporary)]</p><br/><p>[Tae Ho\u2019s Valkyrie (Temporary)]</p><br/><p>[Red Dragon Shootingstar (Female) (Temporary)]</p><br/><p>[Lilly]</p><br/><p>Tae Ho closed his eyes at the green words that appeared in front of him and Cuchulainn clicked his tongue as if it was really pitiful.</p><br/><p>\u201cMa, master?\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha asked because she was bewildered.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha sweated when he didn\u2019t even do that in battles and answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, um\u2026.anyways, the saga itself was strengthened.\u201d</p><br/><p>When it was \u2018The warrior that rode on a Valkyrie\u2019 he stayed as a male Valkyrie but it seemed like it was impossible for \u2018The warrior that rode on a Goddess\u2019.</p><br/><p>In addition, Shootingstar itself was a transformation due to a saga so it was easy to be influenced.</p><br/><p>\u201cW, wait. This is temporary, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha asked hurriedly. Because Rolo was a treasured brother for her. Tae Ho avoided her eyes at the question that had a bit of an angry tone in it.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, um\u2026 P\u2026..robably? I also used it when we came and Rolo looks the same as usual.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018How irresponsible.\u2019</p><br/><p>Rolo had who knows how many kids.</p><br/><p>Bracky\u2019s eyes shone while Adenmaha\u2019s eyes became scarier.</p><br/><p>\u201cSiri, don\u2019t you think that the scales became prettier?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBracky, please.\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri closed Bracky\u2019s mouth and Adenmaha opened her eyes sharply. Tae Ho dodged her eyes and looked forwards.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways, let\u2019s hurry. We have to arrive quickly so that I can release the saga!\u201d</p><br/><p>He spoke ambiguously. Tae Ho ordered with \u2018the one that conquers dragon\u2019s before Adenmaha opened her mouth again.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go Rolo! No, Lilly!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Evil bastard.\u2019</p><br/><p>To fix his name.</p><br/><p>The red dragon increased its speed with its strong wings. It became a red meteor and crossed the skies of Olympus.</p><br/><p>It was a really rough enraged charge.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>\u201cDeimos and Phobos had died.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ares said.</p><br/><p>The ones that were at his surrounding stopped what they were doing and looked at him.</p><br/><p>It was a place filled with corpses. The ones that were dead and lying down were believers of Athena.</p><br/><p>In one of the several polises in between Athens and Sparta.</p><br/><p>Ares sat on a throne made with piled corpses and looked at a distant place. Anger spread on his beautiful face that seemed like it would shine.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not Athena.\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a guess but he was certain of it. Athena didn\u2019t have the strength to deal with Deimos and Phobos right now.</p><br/><p>The great hero of Athena, Odysseus.</p><br/><p>He was more famous for his strategies rather than his fighting power but even so, he still entered the rank of great heroes. He had nothing lacking compared to the other heroes of Athena.</p><br/><p>But he had now become a cold corpse and was at his feet. Ares knew since he was the one that had killed him.</p><br/><p>Odysseus was weakened.</p><br/><p>It was the result of all the blessings of Athena surrounding him having disappeared.</p><br/><p>Athena had become so weak she couldn\u2019t even maintain the blessing to the great hero she favored. So it was impossible for that Athena to have defeated Phobos.</p><br/><p>Someone else.</p><br/><p>Someone that wasn\u2019t a hero of Athena but has the strength to defeat Phobos and Deimos.</p><br/><p>Ares let out a long sigh and then smiled. Fierce flames of rage surged up in all his body.</p><br/><p>It was pure rage. You could say that it was the grief of a father that has lost his children.</p><br/><p>\u201cFind him. Find who he is. I will put an end to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was the order of a God of war. Everyone at his surroundings obeyed without complaining. The pursuers started to move among the warriors of Sparta that were massacring for their God of war.</p><br/><p>The children of Ares.</p><br/><p>The heroes of Ares.</p><br/><p>Their number surpassed the dozens and reached the hundreds.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 52 \u2013 The pursuers (1) &gt; End</p><hr/><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/>\n</div>"}

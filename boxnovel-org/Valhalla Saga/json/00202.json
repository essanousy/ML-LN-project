It won\u2019t last that long.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs you wish.\u201d</p><br/><p>Prometheus started to explain as soon as Tae Ho agreed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAphrodite and Hephaestus are a married couple. But the relationship between the two of them is really bad as Zeus forced them to marry. They are a couple just by words, they look at each other as if they were a cow or a chicken.\u201d</p><br/><p>Prometheus\u2019 way of speaking became more polite.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho was speaking the way he usually did but Prometheus couldn\u2019t not speak politely when the master of a foreign world was.</p><br/><p>\u201cAphrodite cheated with Ares and had some children with him. This means that she had a relation with Ares before she transformed into a being wanting to destroy the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho nodded slowly. There were some children of Aphrodite among the ones that were mixed with Ares\u2019 children.</p><br/><p>\u2018That was too much. To not have any children with his husband but had many with her lover.\u2019</p><br/><p>While Cuchulainn mumbled, Prometheus glanced at Hermes with sharp eyes and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHermes and Aphrodite also had a child.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment everyone turned to look at Hermes. He started to hiccup unconsciously and played dumb.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026um\u2026.well\u2026.mm. That\u2019s a thing of the past. The past. Should we say that it was playing with fire?\u201d</p><br/><p>Prometheus snorted at pitiable excuse and continued speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was indeed a play with fire in Hermes\u2019 case but her relationship with Ares was quite serious. Hephaestus couldn\u2019t endure it anymore and put them to shame.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was when Hermes and Aphrodite got to pay with fire but there was no need to explain it in a long way.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe important thing is that Ares and Aphrodite disliked Hephaestus even before they turned into beings that wanted to destroy the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Their personalities became extreme just like Ares and Artemis had shown them.</p><br/><p>If they originally disliked someone, it would have become hate by now.</p><br/><p>\u201cAres has imprisoned Hephaestus as soon as be turned into a being wanting to destroy the world and handed him over to Aphrodite. And Aphrodite placed him deep in her palace.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were two reasons they didn\u2019t kill him.</p><br/><p>The first one was because of his abilities and the other one was to inflict him pain for a long time.</p><br/><p>\u201cI infiltrated the palace of Aphrodite because I have some debts with Hephaestus but the guards were so solemn I could only hide nearby.\u201d</p><br/><p>Prometheus spoke to that point and held his silence. He spoke with a lowered tone as if he had remembered something terrible.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe screams and cries of Hephaestus were heard from a deep place of Aphrodite\u2019s palace. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s suffering something that can\u2019t be compared to normal torture\u2026..something really terrible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg and Hydra trembled at the same time. It was because they were feeling empathy towards Hephaestus and ended up imagining themselves getting tortured.</p><br/><p>Bracky frowned and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf this man Hephaestus is at the deepest part of Aphrodite\u2019s base, doesn\u2019t that mean that we have to clash against Aphrodite one on one?\u201d</p><br/><p>It would be better than facing against Poseidon head on but even this wouldn\u2019t be easy. In addition, it would be more so if the fighting place was on the base of the enemy.</p><br/><p>But Prometheus shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere won\u2019t be a need. We just have to rescue Hephaestus and escape. Aphrodite isn\u2019t really a battle God. She won\u2019t risk herself to chase after us when we take Hephaestus with us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Not all of the 12 Olympians were proficient in battle.</p><br/><p>Prometheus glanced at Hermes as if asking for agreement and he frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cI also agree but\u2026..Aphrodite is dangerous in another meaning.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat meaning?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the Goddess of beauty and love. In addition, her genealogy is at a high place so her divine power is overwhelming. She can\u2019t fight well but her divine power is right below Zeus-nim and Poseidon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Aphrodite, that was born from Uranus\u2019 penis, could be said to be Zeus\u2019 aunt so she also had the highest genealogy among the 12 Olympians.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it a similar case with Freya-nim and Idun-nim\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>They can\u2019t fight well but instead have a strong divine power.</p><br/><p>Siri mumbled in a low voice and Hermes spoke while still frowning.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways, her beauty and overwhelming divine power are one of the best in Olympus. She can seduce men and women indiscriminately.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo she had a seducing power?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hermes nodded immediately as Adenmaha asked with an uneasy face.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that it\u2019s the end for you if you approach her to a certain range. You can fall over her completely just by looking at her eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what happens if you get seduced?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was Siri this time. Hermes shrugged his shoulders at her question and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou become Aphrodite\u2019s slave. A slave whose life purpose is to make Aphrodite happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>In other words, it was the highest ranked type of seduction.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a moment. Then, what happens with her daily life in that state? Hermes-nim um\u2026..you know right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha dimmed her words and smiled awkwardly. Hermes also smiled awkwardly and explained with an embarrassed face.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I am also one of the 12 Olympians and I took quite solid preparations. And just like you say, Aphrodite also seals her seductive powers because it troubles her daily life activities. But she\u2019s not so nice as to do that against an enemy. In addition she should have become stronger as she turned into a being wanting to destroy the world. Honestly speaking, i\u2019m not confident to shake away her seduction if she is determined to do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was dangerous even when his sacred force was fine so there was nothing to speak about now that his sacred force had disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo the key point should be a battle of speed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri spoke in a low voice. Rescuing Hephaestus the fastest they could and getting out before they faced Aphrodite was their best option.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho, that was listening silently, asked Hermes.</p><br/><p>\u201cHermes, you are able to move to Cyprus right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell\u2026.of course I can. If I draw a magic circle we will be able to enter quite deeply.\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri spoke seriously as Hermes laughed awkwardly and replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t infiltrate directly. You may be able to face Aphrodite as soon as you enter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hermes turned his head and Tae Ho turned to look at everyone. He looked at Prometheus lastly and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s make a plan.\u201d</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>Hephaestus raised his head.</p><br/><p>No, he couldn\u2019t do it. He couldn\u2019t even move one finger because his body was chained up solidly. He just felt like he raised his head.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t know what day was this and how much time had passed. His sense of pain got blocked besides when he got tortured so he felt like he had been thrown into a world of nothingness.</p><br/><p>But it was different this time. His senses were weak but still alive.</p><br/><p>He could feel some divine power that was quite well hidden. It crossed the place filled with Aphrodite\u2019s divine power carefully but quickly.</p><br/><p>Hephaestus held his breath. He concentrated his senses that had started to return slowly and tried hard to check his surroundings.</p><br/><p>He felt a vibration and a sound was heard far away.</p><br/><p>Screams, cries, battle cries.</p><br/><p>Hephaestus barely guessed the situation outside without needing to calculate anything.</p><br/><p>A battle was taking place outside the palace.</p><br/><p>But who was it? Was it Athena?</p><br/><p>Hephaestus felt his heart beat. He felt like tears would flow down just by looking at the figure of the beautiful Goddess of warfare.</p><br/><p>But at the same time Hephaestus realized one thing. And that\u2019s why he trembled. He tried to yell towards the one that was approaching him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hermes!\u2019</p><br/><p>It was him. He was certain this divine power belonged to him.</p><br/><p>You were safe. You remained as a being that wanted to maintain the world. But why did he come here? Did he come here alone? Or was he with Athena?</p><br/><p>But it was still good. That wasn\u2019t the important thing. He had to tell Hermes the fastest possible.</p><br/><p>Light shone at that moment.</p><br/><p>Hephaestus realized that he was opening his eyes. It wasn\u2019t that bright but Hephaestus felt like he would turn blind because he had been stuck in darkness.</p><br/><p>He closed his eyes by reflex and the silence got torn. Voices reached his ear, that were concentrating on the distant sound.</p><br/><p>\u201cHephaestus!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like he still hasn\u2019t noticed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis crazy. The chains won\u2019t break.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAsk the main God. It\u2019s impossible for you alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Several voices were heard at the same time and he knew these voices clearly.</p><br/><p>One was Hermes and the other one was Prometheus.</p><br/><p>But main God?</p><br/><p>Who was he talking about? Could it be Zeus-nim?</p><br/><p>Hephaestus opened his eyes again.. He saw a dark blue divinity. He felt the aura of a dragon and the smell of Asgard.</p><br/><p>The chains binding his arms broke. Hephaestus lost his balance and this time, the voice of a woman was heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cHis injuries are too serious. It\u2019s impossible to move immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her voice was teary. It was clear she was saying that while looking at the injuries in Hephaestus\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Ah.</p><br/><p>Hephaestus held his silence. He could barely get a hold of himself in the middle of the chaos. He lied on someone he didn\u2019t know who he was and opened his mouth to yell something.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a trap!</p><br/><p>But no words came out. He couldn\u2019t form a word with his cut tongue. What he managed to make was close to a roar.</p><br/><p>But Hermes reacted and Hephaestus opened his mouth again. At that moment he felt a strong shock in their chests.</p><br/><p>Hephaestus rolled in the ground with Prometheus. It was the same for Adenmaha that was next to them.</p><br/><p>The one that pushed them hurriedly was Tae Ho. Hermes, the only one that escaped with his own strength, held his scream at the scene in front of him.</p><br/><p>Aphrodite!</p><br/><p>She surged up from the ground with the burst of divinity from the ground and was holding Tae Ho. No, that wasn\u2019t all. She was kissing him.</p><br/><p>How?</p><br/><p>Hermes could know the moment he spoke.</p><br/><p>He was sure APhrodite knew since the beginning. She had waited in the place filled with her divine power just like hiding a tree in a forest.</p><br/><p>Prometheus.</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t betrayed them. He was also as surprised. His eyes when he fell down was filled with shock, guilt and failure.</p><br/><p>Aphrodite discovered Prometheus\u2019 traces when he infiltrated but she just left him be. The stubborn Prometheus would certainly return.</p><br/><p>Having come here wasn\u2019t easy at all. They had barely reached this place after overcoming several difficulties while Nidhogg, Rolo and Ismenios were making a fuss outside the palace.</p><br/><p>And all of that was a well prepared trap.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster!\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha yelled. There was no way it would reach Tae Ho. He didn\u2019t only meet eyes with Aphrodite but was kissing her. They were still embracing each other while their skin touched.</p><br/><p>Hermes thought.</p><br/><p>What did they have to do now?</p><br/><p>Did he have to take Prometheus and Hephaestus and escape?</p><br/><p>His movements were followed by his thoughts. Hermes charged the ground but then collapsed. That occurred as he hurriedly dodged the sword Tae Ho swung.</p><br/><p>Aphrodite laughed. She stroke Tae Ho\u2019s cheek and then kissed him again.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho received her kiss with an enchanted expression.</p><br/><p>Everything ended.</p><br/><p>Hermes thought. In the end, the master of Asgard was also a man.</p><br/><p>It was when that thought was subsiding. A desire of wanting to see Aphrodite\u2019s face surged up from Hermes.</p><br/><p>It certainly was a crazy thing.</p><br/><p>Hermes thought with the small rationality he had. Infiltrating the center of the sacred force where the enemy could release their strongest power was a really foolish thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster!\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha yelled anxiously again and Aphrodite laughed at her eagerness. She looked down at Adenmaha as if laughing at her and stroke Tae Ho\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>Aphrodite was beautiful. It seemed like her white gold hair that seemed that was made by melting the stars and the starlight was emitting light by its own. Her white skin without flaws was really bright and fresh, and her body that was covered by a thin pink cloth that revealed almost everything was perfection itself.</p><br/><p>She had seduced Tae Ho. She possessed the only hope of Olympus.</p><br/><p>Aphrodite kissed Tae Ho again. Hermes felt jealousy and malice appeared in Adenmaha\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho grabbed Aphrodite\u2019s thin waist and surged up his dark blue divinity on the sword that he grabbed his free right hand.</p><br/><p>And he said. He whispered his wishes as a slave to her master.</p><br/><p>Aphrodite giggled at that whisper. She bit Tae Ho\u2019s ears as if it was quite a special fetish and then spoke with a sweet voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a meeting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha opened her eyes roundly and thought that she had heard things wrongly.</p><br/><p>And Cuchulainn said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Nasty bastard.\u2019</p><br/><p>Kwagang!</p><br/><p>The dark blue divinity exploded and the pink divinity also burst out.</p><br/><p>Hermes, that was half bewitched, raised his head and checked his surroundings with his cleared head.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho was standing there. He couldn\u2019t see Aphrodite but he could feel her divinity. She was releasing her malice after receiving a big injury.</p><br/><p>How?</p><br/><p>Just why!</p><br/><p>[Headband of resistance]</p><br/><p>[Tear of the dark elf]</p><br/><p>[Promise of the succubus]</p><br/><p>[Immovable armor]</p><br/><p>[Hermes\u2019 steps]</p><br/><p>Known as the mental resistance setting.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t all. He used five mental resistance runes and five resistance runes as the successor of Odin. He brainwashed himself with Bragi\u2019s rune and strengthened his own love.</p><br/><p>But regardless of that, it was true that he had been seduced for a really short moment. Because of that, Tae Ho got a hold of himself and decided to make this an opportunity.</p><br/><p>[Saga: The warrior that had a Goddess meet him]</p><br/><p>[Content\u2019s classification: Olympus]</p><br/><p>[Athena]</p><br/><p>[Hestia]</p><br/><p>[Echidna]</p><br/><p>[Aphrodite]</p><br/><p>She certainly got added.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you like it? Huh?\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho didn\u2019t answer to Cuchulainn\u2019s question. He just grabbed Arondight firmly that still had blood in it while everyone was looking at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t Aphrodite this time but Hermes. Tae Ho swung his sword widely and broke the aura of Aphrodite that was filling the surroundings.</p><br/><p>The other reason he could endure Aphrodite\u2019s seduction.</p><br/><p>\u201cFreya is prettier.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Goddess of beauty of Asgard and not Olympus.</p><br/><p>That was it.</p><br/><p>Men are blind with their own causes.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 59 \u2013 God of conquest (4) &gt; End</p><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/valhalla-saga-chapter-201\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 201\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/valhalla-saga-chapter-203\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 203\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"95746\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

After breathing roughly because of having killed the sixth or seventh monster, the sound of the horn trumpet was heard along with the cheers.</p><br/><p>And how many hours have passed after that?</p><br/><p>Tae Ho returned with the ship and was sitting in front of a big round table. The table was filled with alcohol and meat, and the warriors of the same table were busy eating, drinking and talking to each other.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is this\u2026..the night banquet?\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho looked at his surroundings. He could see the men with really big frames that were all sitting close to each other and felt like the temperature rose by 5 degrees.</p><br/><p>It was certainly a banquet. Because it had alcohol and meat.</p><br/><p>\u2018Although it really only has alcohol and meat.\u2019</p><br/><p>It felt quite simple for it to be Valhalla\u2019s banquet, that the Gods participated. And he couldn\u2019t even see the Valkyries around. The only things he could see were the smelly and muscled men.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho looked at his surroundings and drank alcohol. It wasn\u2019t that he particularly liked alcohol, but he could only drink it as it was the only thing on the table. He thought that he wouldn\u2019t have an appetite after the first battle of his life but that wasn\u2019t the case at all. After he put some meat on his mouth, it kept going in well.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s eat first.\u2019</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that delicious as it was merely grilled, but it was still meat. He had to fill his stomach first.</p><br/><p>\u2018But where do I sleep?\u2019</p><br/><p>Will he eat and drink all night and then go to the next battlefield?</p><br/><p>Even if this was the case, Valhalla was a place that had sent him to the battlefield without any explanations. He wondered, but it wasn\u2019t that there were no probabilities.</p><br/><p>\u2018But even so.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung man.\u201d</p><br/><p>A voice was heard. As Tae Ho turned his head he saw a familiar face. It was the man he saw at the ship.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you survived. Then you can teach me your name now. I am called Bjorn.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man-Bjorn smiled and sat next to Tae Ho. He was so tall that Tae Ho had to raise his head to look at him in the eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Lee Tae Ho.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Tae Ho revealed his name, Bjorn tilted his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? You have a peculiar name. Now that I see you are also wearing peculiar clothes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bjorn opened his eyes sharply and then looked at Tae Ho from head to toes. Tae Ho wanted to yell that he realized that only now, but he forced himself to calm down and said with a calm voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong. I\u2019m sure there was a mistake.\u201d</p><br/><p>Actually he spoke these words without expecting for much. Because if these words did work, he wouldn\u2019t have gone to the battlefield at all.</p><br/><p>But unexpectedly, Bjorn nodded and agreed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems so. People with similar names to yours are supposed to go to the next town.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was right. Something was wrong even when looking at it with this place\u2019s standpoint.</p><br/><p>But most of all, the last words picked Tae Ho\u2019s interest.</p><br/><p>\u201cNext town?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Didn\u2019t I tell you at the ship? About Asgard and the nine planets. People with similar names to yours shouldn\u2019t be supposed to gather at Valhalla but at another place. What was the place called\u2026\u2026temple?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho blinked. And then drank some of the beer.</p><br/><p>If Bjorn\u2019s words were true, then there were nine more planets aside of Valhalla, and the place called temple was the place where people with names similar to Tae Ho\u2019s gathered at.</p><br/><p>But that was everything.</p><br/><p>\u2018No. At least\u2019 it\u2019s possible that there are Koreans over there.\u2019</p><br/><p>Of course, that may not be the case. Because it was only similar for Bjorn.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, having come here is also fate, don\u2019t you think? You are even able to write your saga. I\u2019m certain you were destined to come here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bjorn smiled as it was complicated at all. He wan\u2019t to refute back but his words seemed right.</p><br/><p>\u201cMost of all, it looks like you have accomplished quite the merits. You have quite a bit of runes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you see something?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bjorn laughed as Tae Ho asked back reflexively.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, right. You didn\u2019t even know what a saga was. Then I will explain it to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bjorn paused for a moment and then touched his chin as if he was choosing the correct words.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should also know it, but all of the existences that have life have mana in their bodies. Be it small or big. And that\u2019s also the same for the enemies of Valhalla.\u201d</p><br/><p>The dog headed monsters were certainly living creatures. But even so, he didn\u2019t feel rejection at the thought of having killed something right because it was a monster. In the first place, Tae Ho\u2019s life was at danger.</p><br/><p>As Tae Ho nodded slowly, Bjorn kept explaining.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen the warriors of Valhalla defeat the enemies, they can take their mana and convert it to magical runes. Think of the time when you thought of your saga.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was an unreasonable request, but Tae Ho closed his eyes and tried it. And in the end exclaimed.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Lowest rune : 7]</p><br/><p>A new shiny message appeared below the saga category.</p><br/><p>Bjorn pinched Tae Ho\u2019s chest with his big fingers and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can use the runes and strengthen your abilities. There are some conditions but you will be able to learn magic and a new saga.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Simply put, you upgrade your stats and level up your skills right?\u2019</p><br/><p>He felt like he knew what he had to do. Bjorn kept speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst is physical abilities \u2013 and among them I recommend you strengthening your stamina. Your body is the first thing that will get spent on the battlefield.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho nodded but he didn\u2019t use the runes immediately. He had too little information right now. If he had to go to the battlefield again he would have used the runes, but he still had time.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, but why aren\u2019t the Valkyries here?\u201d</p><br/><p>The black haired Valkyrie that led Tae Ho to Valhalla. She had certainly told him to meet at the night banquet again.</p><br/><p>At Tae Ho\u2019s question, Bjorn clicked his tongue and then patted Tae Ho\u2019s shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Valkyries aren\u2019t here. They are at another banquet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnother banquet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the lowest banquet were the lowest class warriors and newcomers gather at. That\u2019s why the food and the alcohol is like this. If you want to drink with the Valkyries you will have to work hard. Because you will have to at least climb to the intermediate banquet.\u201d</p><br/><p>So that was why the food was like this. For there to be ranks at the banquets.</p><br/><p>\u2018How petty. They discriminate with food.\u2019</p><br/><p>Anyways, it seemed like the privileges of a high class wasn\u2019t only the banquet. Perhaps you may receive better equipment or get a special technique.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bjorn said that this was the place for newcomers and the lowest class warriors. Then was Bjorn also a lowest class warrior?</p><br/><p>At Tae Ho\u2019s question, Bjorn laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI just came down to see you.\u201d</p><br/><p>In other words, he wasn\u2019t a newcomer.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m really thankful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho bowed towards Bjorn. It wasn\u2019t a face action, but his true feelings. If Bjorn hadn\u2019t taught him the saga at the ship, he would have died in today\u2019s battlefield.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou do know some manners. I like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bjorn nodded and placed a hand in Tae Ho\u2019s shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have talent. You will be able to climb up fast. If you have to fight anyways, isn\u2019t it better to get good treatment and then fight?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was certainly encouraging him, but why was strength leaving his body? Tae Ho forced a smile and then asked another question.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, but where will I sleep today?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was curious about many things, but for now, he had to take care of his basic needs the most urgently.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, you were sent to the battlefield as soon as you came so you wouldn\u2019t know. It will be announced later on anyways, but your lodging will depend on what legion of a God you follow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA legion?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, the Valkyrie warriors are all under a legion of the Gods of Asgard.\u201d</p><br/><p>He thought of something. Tae Ho opened his eyes sharply and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m just asking but do the blessings differ regarding on what God you follow?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, you are quite fast to catch on. That\u2019s right. It\u2019s the same for the affiliated Valkyries.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was right. He still didn\u2019t know what blessing gave each God, but he felt like it was up to luck.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s starting now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bjorn pointed to the middle of the hall with a gesture of his chin. He turned to look reflexively and then saw a gold haired Valkyrie. It was Reginleif.</p><br/><p>\u201cWarriors! I have seen today\u2019s performance well! Valhalla welcomes you, exalted warriors!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOhh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThor!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThor!\u201d</p><br/><p>The warriors raised their cups and claimed the name of the God of thunder. Reginleif put on a proud smile and then raised her voice again.</p><br/><p>\u201cStarting from now, I will teach you your affiliation! Everyone, look at your cups! Now, you will remember the name of the you will believe and follow!\u201d</p><br/><p>Reginleif swung her sword on the air after she finished speaking. Then, light started shine and was poured over the heads of the warriors after having split to hundreds and thousands of pieces.</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry up. Check it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bjorn urged. The warriors at his surrounding also looked at their cups.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho, that was amazed at the particles of light, looked down at his cup. Shiny words started to appear where there was nothing before.</p><br/><p>\u2018Please! Please!\u2019</p><br/><p>Although he only knew about Odin, Thor and Freya in norse mythology, Tae Ho still had a legion he wanted to be affiliated.</p><br/><p>Odin or Thor.</p><br/><p>A strong God!</p><br/><p>\u201cOdin!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOhh! Thor!\u201d</p><br/><p>The warriors started to talk among themselves. Tae Ho gulped dry saliva and then looked at his cup. It was the first time he had seen these symbols, but he could clearly read it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u00f0unn?\u201d</p><br/><p>Obviously, it was a name he didn\u2019t know. And because of that, Tae Ho turned his head and looked at Bjorn.</p><br/><p>And then, Bjorn clicked his tongue and patted Tae Ho\u2019s shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cCheer up.\u201d</p><br/><p>What did he mean with that?</p><br/><p>Tae Ho wanted to ask when he already knew the answer.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 2 \u2013 Legion (1) &gt; End</p><br/>\n</div>"}

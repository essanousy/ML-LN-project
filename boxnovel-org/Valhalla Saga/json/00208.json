The traces of light that the two swords formed created a path of light and sword aura that flew towards Poseidon at different angles.</p><br/><p>Poseidon raised Triana by reflex. He placed it delicately between the two sword auras and managed to block both attacks.</p><br/><p>But that was all. The sword of the round table and Excalibur fell down with a time difference and hit both the upper and lower part of Triana. When the upper part of Triana was struck by the sword of the round table causing Poseidon\u2019s wrist to twist, Excalibur hit the lower part and forced Poseidon\u2019s grip to loosen.</p><br/><p>Poseidon didn\u2019t drop Triana but his defense had been broken perfectly. His wrist broke at that moment and delivered a terrible pain.</p><br/><p>Poseidon gritted his teeth. Enduring the pain, he released his divine power. He then rolled on the ground and tried to push Tae Ho away.</p><br/><p>But Tae Ho countered with his own divine power. He retrieved his weapons and rolled on the ground.</p><br/><p>The two divine powers clashed head on. Prometheus\u2019 prediction wasn\u2019t wrong. Poseidon was certainly a level above Tae Ho if you simply looked at the amount of divine power and its strength. Poseidon also possessed the power of the primeval God Pontus in him.</p><br/><p>He\u2019s getting pushed back.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho could push him back.</p><br/><p>This was when a smile spread on Poseidon\u2019s bearded face.</p><br/><p>The sword of the round table stabbed the ground and created a ripple in Poseidon\u2019s blue divinity that was competing in strength with Tae Ho\u2019s dark blue divinity. It created an abnormality in Poseidon\u2019s divine power with its God killer strength.</p><br/><p>Poseidon activated Talaria hurriedly, trying to temporarily create some distance.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho couldn\u2019t push back Poseidon\u2019s blue divine power completely so he just made it explode. Poseidon got pushed backwards and Tae Ho charged forward. Tae Ho crossed his arms and put on a stance as if he was about to pull out his sword.</p><br/><p>The sentence of the Milesian appeared in his left hand, and the sentence of Erin showed in his right hand.</p><br/><p>These two sentences were special. The sentence of Milesian was the sentence of the knights of the round table. The twelve sentences that had merged and become one was a match to the sentence of Erin.</p><br/><p>The sentence of the Milesian told him.</p><br/><p>The sword of the round table that had become one told Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>The battle method of the knights of the round table.</p><br/><p>How they fought, and the laws and secrets of their arts.</p><br/><p>It was similar to the sentences. Those had also become one. It wasn\u2019t a familiar thing for Tae Ho as he had learnt each weapon of the knights of the round table in the tower of shadows.</p><br/><p>Double flash.</p><br/><p>It was a combination of Kalsted\u2019s and Scathach\u2019s techniques that could bring an end to catastrophe.</p><br/><p>And right now, the battle method of the knights of the round table combined with Kalsted\u2019s technique. It gave birth to a new skill.</p><br/><p>Kalsted\u2019s technique.</p><br/><p>Twelve blades.</p><br/><p>Twelve swords, twelve pairs of wings.</p><br/><p>The sword that contained the essence of the twelve knights of Camelot but was only one.</p><br/><p>The start was the sword of Lancelot.</p><br/><p>The one sword strike that never looked back was wielded by the strongest knight of the round table.</p><br/><p>The sword of the round table and Triana clashed once again. Poseidon recovered his wrist in that while and blocked the attack of Tae Ho while grabbing Triana with two hands.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a simple clash of strength. It was a combination between divine power and speed.</p><br/><p>Poseidon was pushed back. The defense he constructed with Triana was shattered, but Tae Ho\u2019s attack had just started.</p><br/><p>The second sword was the sword of Agravain, the knight of truth.</p><br/><p>The third one, the sword of Bedivere, known as black loyalty.</p><br/><p>The Sword of Truth was sharper than everything and the Sword of Loyalty was heavier than everything.</p><br/><p>Poseidon formed some more tridents of water alongside Triana and reacted to Tae Ho but it wasn\u2019t enough.</p><br/><p>Every time the swords of the knights of the round table unleashed an attack, the tridents disappeared into dust. Poseidon couldn\u2019t defend himself in front of the twelve blades.</p><br/><p>The tenth sword of the round,Galahad\u2019s blade, was the sword of perfection. This time, Poseidon fruitlessly tried to block with a shield of water instead.</p><br/><p>Poseidon staggered back. Tae Ho chased after Poseidon and brandished his eleventh weapon.</p><br/><p>The stab of Percival, the godly spear knight.</p><br/><p>Poseidon poured down divine power to block Percival\u2019s technique . He didn\u2019t even have time to raise the sea water and simply poured out his divine power to barely hold off.</p><br/><p>Excalibur pierced through the blue barrier. A crack formed inthe blue shield of divine power shattering it toto pieces. And at that moment Poseidon realized something.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t fall back anymore. The walls of Mesena were touching his back.</p><br/><p>But Tae Ho still had the twelfth sword.</p><br/><p>Poseidon screamed mentally. He poured all the strength he had towards the Asgardian God of battle.</p><br/><p>Sea water emerged from the sky, the ground and all other places. The deluge pouring down the walls was a really unnatural phenomenon.</p><br/><p>It was a really overwhelming amount of water. It seemed like Poseidon was planning to erase Tae Ho\u2019s existence completely even at the cost of all his divine power.</p><br/><p>But Tae Ho didn\u2019t look away. He grasped Excalibur firmly to execute the twelfth sword and stepped on the ground with strength.</p><br/><p>He claimed to the whole world who the real master of Mesena was with the a roar that shook the skies and the earth.</p><br/><p>[Myth ranked saga]</p><br/><p>[Hall of Valhalla]</p><br/><p>Mesena\u2019s defenders cheered. Apollo had handed over his sacred force to Athena but now this land became Erin by Tae Ho\u2019s power. This land now belonged to him.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho\u2019s dark blue divine power not only covered himself but also surged up the walls and encroached on the sea water. The sea water Poseidon called over was still here but was purged of Poseidon\u2019s divine power. Poseidon lost the right to control the flood.</p><br/><p>The sea water scattered. The remaining water succumbed to gravity and fell from the sky like a waterfall.</p><br/><p>Kwagagagang!</p><br/><p>The ground shook from to the overwhelming amount of water but didn\u2019t reach Tae Ho. The twelfth sword, the sword of the knight of sun Gawain split the sea water.</p><br/><p>The water crashed down. It separated and spread to the surroundings and swept down everything with the overwhelming volume of water.</p><br/><p>Poseidon and Tae Ho were in the center of that vortex.</p><br/><p>When Poseidon let out a roar and rolled his feet, water dragons rose up around him and charged toward Tae Ho. Each one resembled a sea serpent in size and strength.</p><br/><p>But even now Tae Ho still didn\u2019t look away. He just accepted the attack his body and activated two more sagas.</p><br/><p>[Myth ranked saga]</p><br/><p>[Incarnation of the World Dragon]</p><br/><p>[Myth ranked saga]</p><br/><p>[Dragon monarch]</p><br/><p>Wings of light spread from Tae Ho\u2019s back and his eyes morphed. He ordered the water dragons as the incarnation of the World dragon.</p><br/><p>Scatter.</p><br/><p>That was enough. The water dragons couldn\u2019t maintain their form and lost shape. They couldn\u2019t resist the order of the World dragon.</p><br/><p>\u201cTalaria!\u201d</p><br/><p>Poseidon utilized Talaria hurriedly and disappeared from in front of Tae Ho. Tae Ho simply stabbed Poseidon\u2019s back with the sword of the round table and Excalibur instead of chasing him.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>Poseidon groaned. The two swords invaded Poseidon\u2019s wounds and made him bleed.</p><br/><p>How?</p><br/><p>Poseidon\u2019s face was bewilderment itself. He hadn\u2019t simply moved quickly but teleported to flank behind Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t make sense that Tae Ho had read his movements or felt a presence.</p><br/><p>That wasn\u2019t it. It wasn\u2019t like Poseidon thought. The solution was much simpler.</p><br/><p>\u2018Normally they all appear at your back.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn snickered and said. He just guessed but the effects were clear.</p><br/><p>Poseidon activated Talaria once again and tried to flee from Tae Ho. But Tae Ho swung Excalibur and the sword of the round table, leaving a long gash across Poseidon\u2019s upper body.</p><br/><p>Poseidon retreated a hundred meters in an instant and staggered. It was dueto the God killer power within the sword of the round table. The blood poured constantly from the wound generated in his chest.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho turned around and glared at Poseidon. Poseidon also glared back and thought.</p><br/><p>He was still superior regarding on divine power. In addition he wasn\u2019t alone. There were several sea monsters in the remaining portion of ocean.</p><br/><p>Poseidon fiercely gritted his teeth. Fighting like a human was disadvantageous for him. Fighting against the Asgard\u2019s God of battle like a human was crazy because those savages only knew how to fight and eat.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why he had to fight like a God. He had to deal with this battle as the ruler of the sea like how he fought the Titans in Titanomachy.</p><br/><p>Poseidon calmed his breathing and transformed into a two meter tall titan with blue skin, a strong body and a cool white beard. It was his original appearance as a Titan, before becoming a God of Olympus.</p><br/><p>From this, Poseidon\u2019s body swelled up to 10 meters in an instant. Blue scales appeared on his body and the sea water covering the floor became surging pillars.</p><br/><p>Poseidon stood on twenty of the water pillars and grabbed an enlarged Triana. He glared down at the God of Asgard who even though wielded the power of a dragon was still only human and claimed.</p><br/><p>He would sweep down the entire city.</p><br/><p>Erase everything precious to Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>He would make the dragons despise him more and more and in the end beg to be killed with their own mouths.</p><br/><p>And in the end, he would shred them to pieces and feed them to the pigs.</p><br/><p>He would inflict pain that Tae Ho couldn\u2019t even dare to imagine to those that followed Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>Poseidon would stop the Master of Asgard and then his monsters would sweep through the city. He would bestow a gruesome death to all related to the Master of Asgard.</p><br/><p>The divine power of Poseidon was truly overwhelming when combined with the power of the primeval God of the sea, Pontus. It was so strong it seemed like it could snuff out Tae Ho\u2019s divinity at any moment.</p><br/><p>But Tae Ho didn\u2019t mind. He didn\u2019t show fear even though the sea and its countless monsters passed the walls and reached the city.</p><br/><p>He simply grasped the sword of the round table and Excalibur while facing Poseidon.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho erupted with laughter.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a refreshing laugh that he brought up from the depths of his lung. He smirked with a calm and peaceful expression that didn\u2019t suit a place like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo it if you can.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho provoked.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t saying that because Adenmaha, Nidhogg and Echidna weren\u2019t precious to him. Or because he didn\u2019t believe in Drakon, Ismenios or Rolo either.</p><br/><p>The master of Asgard, Tae Ho, could know.</p><br/><p>That Poseidon wasn\u2019t the only one that was ahead of schedule.</p><br/><p>That the God of Sea wasn\u2019t the only one that had surpassed expectations.</p><br/><p>Excalibur and the sword of the round table blazed with light once again.</p><br/><p>The aura of Asgard surging up from the \u2018Hall of Valhalla\u2019 welcomed the one who approached.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho stepped forward.</p><br/><p>Poseidon gulped dry saliva from that simple step. His eyes widened and he turned to look at another place by reflex.</p><br/><p>The southeast.</p><br/><p>From a place still far awaythe sound of thunder was approaching.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 60 \u2013 Sword of the round table (1) &gt; End</p><hr/><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/valhalla-saga-chapter-207\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 207\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/valhalla-saga-chapter-209\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 209\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"95763\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

It has already been a few months since the nickname, deeply engraved into the heads of the warriors of Valhalla, was called. There was a high probability that it got created in this place because King Sven and his people had witnessed Adenmaha\u2019s transformation followed by the shock of the warriors.</p><br/><p>\u2018Although it\u2019s embarrassing to show it to others.\u2019</p><br/><p>You could somewhat hide your saga if you didn\u2019t want to show it to others. But of course, it was unknown if there was someone other than Tae Ho that could see the sagas of others.</p><br/><p>\u2018Anyways.\u2019</p><br/><p>He was curious as to what effects it had. Honestly speaking, it was more because he couldn\u2019t grasp what it was just by looking at its name.</p><br/><p>\u2018The contents of the saga\u2026.Is as I expect.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was something he would believe if someone like Rolph or Bracky used.</p><br/><p>But it was when Tae Ho was still reviewing his saga.</p><br/><p>The warriors of Valhalla debating whether they should grill or boil the Kraken meat. Bracky, that was chewing a sashimi piece of the Kraken as a test, was putting on sharp eyes.</p><br/><p>They had defeated the Kraken.</p><br/><p>King Sven and the people were happy on the flying ship and the sea and sky had turned calm.</p><br/><p>But the warriors felt something they couldn\u2019t see.</p><br/><p>Siri sniffed. It was because she felt something aside of the sea and the Kraken.</p><br/><p>The scent of danger.</p><br/><p>The scent only a veteran hunter could feel.</p><br/><p>Siri frowned unconsciously. It was only for a moment but she even doubted her hunter side.</p><br/><p>The Kraken wasn\u2019t a hunter. It was a bait.</p><br/><p>It was an impossible thing. If that huge Kraken wasn\u2019t the hunter, then what was the real hunter?</p><br/><p>Siri stood up. She hurriedly looked below her feet and Bracky and the other warriors also did the same thing although with a bit of delay.</p><br/><p>\u2018My God! Master!\u2019</p><br/><p>Adenmaha yelled quickly. The moment Tae Ho heard her urgent yell he also yelled towards Siri.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are coming!\u201d</p><br/><p>Papapak!</p><br/><p>Explosions occurred inside the sea. No, precisely speaking it was the aftershock generated by something surging up the water.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t one but several. The current of water started to flow backwards with the Kraken in the center and drops of water scattered to the surroundings.</p><br/><p>At the same time a black and huge shadow covered the warriors. When the warriors looked up to see what had covered them they could identify the shadow.</p><br/><p>Huge sharks.</p><br/><p>No, sea monsters you couldn\u2019t even call as sharks!</p><br/><p>Saying that they had surged up wasn\u2019t an exaggeration. Some of them bit down the corpse of the Kraken and some others threw themselves again towards the warriors.</p><br/><p>Siri moved quickly to dodge the attacks of the sharks. They were huge enough to be able to bite down her slim waist in one bite, no, were able to gulp her down entirely.</p><br/><p>Bracky didn\u2019t dodge them and chose to swing his hammer. Although he was on top of the unstable and slippery corpse of the Kraken he had achieved hitting the side of a shark and push it back with his overwhelming strength.</p><br/><p>It was similar for the other warriors. Most of them chose to evade them like Siri but some of them pushed them back with their shields or split their stomachs with their swords.</p><br/><p>The group of sharks also appeared in the side of the flying ship. King Sven and the people couldn\u2019t even scream because they were frightened out of their wits. But fortunately Ingrid was the one on the flying pirate ship. She maintained her business-like expression and fired a harpoon to pierce the head of a shark and then increased the height and prevented the sharks from attacking her.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile Tae Ho jumped down the sea. What he was looking at was the strengthless Adenmaha.</p><br/><p>\u201cAdenmaha! Return!\u201d</p><br/><p>When he yelled by extending the summoning rock that was almost out of magic power, white light started to cover Adenmaha. She fired an ice breath towards the sharks that tried to attack her and yelled.</p><br/><p>\u2018Be careful!\u2019</p><br/><p>Adenmaha disappeared. The frozen shark hit the surface and created a big wave and Tae Ho kicked in the air and surged up. Adenmaha\u2019s last warning was to warn him about the shark that would attack him from below.</p><br/><p>\u201cChant!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho twisted his body in the air and transformed into a hawk. The shark that had surged up only bit down the air and Tae Ho flew over that shark.</p><br/><p>\u2018Retreat for now and reorganize yourself. The ones on the flying ship are a hinder.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn spoke quickly. Although those were harsh words he was speaking the truth. Now that there were several enemies it was better the more boats they had.</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho!\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri jumped into Scuabtuinne and yelled. Bracky and the other warriors also got on the boat and Tae Ho looked at Ingrid. She seemed to have made the same decision as Cuchulainn that she yelled in a loud voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are retreating! Protecting the humans is our priority!\u201d</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t escaping. Actually there was no need to intentionally emphasize that but Ingrid had specifically chosen those words because there was king Sven and the humans.</p><br/><p>The flying ship turned around first. Scuabtuinne followed its back and Tae Ho flew up once again and looked at the corpse of the Kraken again. Although the herd of sharks that appeared suddenly were strong he felt that there was something else.</p><br/><p>And his prediction wasn\u2019t wrong.</p><br/><p>Siri held her breath while controlling Scuabtuinne and realized whose scent was the scent of the hunter. Bracky opened his eyes widely and cursed.</p><br/><p>Babang!</p><br/><p>An explosion that seemed to be a thunder burst out.</p><br/><p>It was because an existence that couldn\u2019t be compared to the sharks at all had appeared.</p><br/><p>Something similar to a shark landed on top of the Kraken. A monster that was much bigger than all the sharks that had appeared until now stood on its four legs and glared at Scuabtuinne.</p><br/><p>It had big and sharp horns on its head. Small sparks got created and exploded from its horns as if warning of a big thunder beforehand.</p><br/><p>It was the leader that led the herd of sharks. It was the one that had made the Kraken escape to the surface.</p><br/><p>The real cause that had destroyed the ships.</p><br/><p>It roared loudly as if declaring war. Different to the roar of normal beasts, the strong roar that resembled a shockwave spread widely on the sea.</p><br/><p>Ingrid opened her eyes sharply and glared at it. However she didn\u2019t turn around the ship. The flying ship flew towards the port and Scuabtuinne, that was controlled by Siri followed back with great speed.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho, that was left last, glared at it from the sky. It also seemed to have realized Tae Ho\u2019s gaze that it raised its head. It had blue and black eyes that resembled the sea.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s go.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn said. Tae Ho fluttered his wings once more and moved towards Siri and her group.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>As the warriors of Valhalla started to return to the port, the people of the port started to cheer passionately. They had witnessed the warriors defeat the Kraken but they didn\u2019t fear anything. What should they be scared of when they had the warriors of the Gods?</p><br/><p>After king Sven also got a hold of himself to a certain extent, he expressed his thanks to the warriors.</p><br/><p>Although they did retreat, it wasn\u2019t that they had escaped after fighting.</p><br/><p>Their retreat had a meaning behind it.</p><br/><p>In addition king Sven had witnessed the mythological fight of the warriors himself. The battle that split the sea and called thunders. As they had defeated the fifty meters big Kraken and had even rescued his people he couldn\u2019t have any complaints.</p><br/><p>They would also defeat the herd of sharks soon. They will open a path for the ships.</p><br/><p>The advisor Ube expressed a bit of concern but king Sven ignored him. He opened a big banquet for the warriors of Valhalla, that had died and returned.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was then. The warrior that rode on a Valkyrie\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>King Sven started to relate what had happened today with an excited face and voice. He was already repeating the same thing for the seventh time but no one seemed to be tired of listening to him.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho approached that Sven and said silently.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Idun\u2019s warrior. Idun\u2019s warrior.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, yes! Of course! Idun\u2019s warrior! The warrior of the beautiful Goddess of youth!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe ship also belongs to Idun-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOhh! The ship that can fly on air!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun-nim\u2019s treasure!\u201d</p><br/><p>As the people of Midgard started to claim her name, Tae Ho put on a satisfied face and returned to the place he originally was. Siri, that was leaning back on a window and drinking alcohol, laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are working hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have to when you can.\u201d</p><br/><p>Actually, Tae Ho felt more confused when he saw that the other warriors weren\u2019t as earnest at him on promoting his legion.</p><br/><p>\u2018No, is it the leisure the big legions have?\u2019</p><br/><p>Because they would still get newcomers even if they stayed still.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho looked towards the warriors of Valhalla. Although the excited warriors were speaking with the beautiful ladies they weren\u2019t particularly emphasizing the name of their Gods like Tae Ho did.</p><br/><p>Siri laughed once again and then looked at Tae Ho. Although she stayed silent because Tae Ho\u2019s actions seemed cute but she also wanted to tease him.</p><br/><p>Because you had to first die to enter Valhalla.</p><br/><p>How long would the people, that had started to believe in Idun after listening to Tae Ho, need to enter Valhalla?</p><br/><p>There may be battles any time so it could be faster than what he thought but having faith in Idun wasn\u2019t something that could be achieved in mere months.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you laughing like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s funny.\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri laughed once again and then patted on the shoulder of Tae Ho that seemed like he didn\u2019t understand and then said while looking at the warriors.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that we look different for the people of Midgard. Just like we are covered in light. Should I say that it\u2019s a glory? It seems like we become much pretty, handsome, cool, flashy. So anyways, it seems like we get beautified.\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri was laughing more than usual perhaps because of the alcohol. She laughed once more and then pointed at the women next to Bracky with her eyes. It seemed like they had completely fallen for Bracky that they were putting embarrassed faces while flushing.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that was the reason.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was kind of weird.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I will also be going.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will cheer for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri seemed like she wasn\u2019t planning on intervening that she just slightly raised her cup. Tae Ho toasted with her and then started his promotion again.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>After listening to the stories of the epidemic that had started to spread in the continent and how the routes of the ships got blocked, the night had soon deepened.</p><br/><p>Bracky and the warriors wanted to have a close time with the women but Ingrid didn\u2019t permit them. As they had enjoyed themselves it was time to prepare for tomorrow.</p><br/><p>Although they had enjoyed the banquet for a few hours the warriors of Valhalla were all clear headed. When they gathered on the room king Sven had prepared, Ingrid started their strategy meeting.</p><br/><p>The real cause that blocked the route of the ships was the herd of sharks.</p><br/><p>Their objective wasn\u2019t the annihilation of the herd. The first thing they had to aim for was the leader. If they just removed him, the herd would breakdown naturally.</p><br/><p>In the first place, the sharks weren\u2019t monsters that formed a group like this. As they were a kind of sea monster, if they just removed their leader that was the center of the group there was a high possibility for them to go their own paths.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe problem is how we should fight.\u201d</p><br/><p>The warriors of Valhalla were proficient in operating a ship, but using a normal ship and fight was like commiting suicide. With one body slam of the monsters the ship would turn to pieces.</p><br/><p>Although they were big, they weren\u2019t as big as the kraken so it was impossible to fight on top of them.</p><br/><p>Then how should they fight?</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a method if we get the preparations.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ingrid said in a low voice. Some of them had curious faces and the others seemed to know what it was.</p><br/><p>One of the warriors that was on the latter laughed and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cIngrid-nim is the Valkyrie of Njord\u2019s legion.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOhh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed!\u201d</p><br/><p>The warriors understood immediately and exclaimed. But Tae Ho was the only one that didn\u2019t understand and asked by whispering Siri.</p><br/><p>\u201cCaptain SIri, who is Njord-nim?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn started to laugh at Tae Ho\u2019s question as if he was flustered and Siri just blinked as if she was bewildered and then pulled on Tae Ho\u2019s ears and answered in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe God of Sea.\u201d</p><br/><p>The father of Freya and Freyr, Njord.</p><br/><p>Ingrid proposed a method to fight in the sea.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>The night passed and morning came. The warriors of Valhalla had a solid breakfast and finished their preparations and then went to the port that was looking at the noon.</p><br/><p>The countless people wanted to go together with the warriors of Valhalla but honestly speaking they would only be a baggage to them. Ingrid only allowed king Sven to accompany them.</p><br/><p>\u2018They will also be thinking of battling. Having appeared that confidently is proof of that.\u2019</p><br/><p>Ingrid and Cuchulainn thought similarly. So they would be able to allure them with some kind of momentum.</p><br/><p>\u2018So, this is how it turned out?\u2019</p><br/><p>Adenmaha, that got called back again in one day, grumbled.</p><br/><p>The flying ship, that was carrying Scuabtuinne, was so high you couldn\u2019t even see it. The only ones floating in the sea were Adenmaha and Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause I believe in you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho caressed Adenmaha\u2019s scales and then she snorted as if telling him not to spout nonsense.</p><br/><p>There was a lot of blood of cows and pigs spread near Adenmaha. It was to lead the sharks that were sensitive to the smell of blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cI really do believe in you. I\u2019m really thankful for yesterday. You were really pretty. No, really beautiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Le, leave it. Do you think i\u2019m a kid?\u2019</p><br/><p>Adenmaha grumbled but Tae Ho could read her emotions because of the \u2018one that controls dragons\u2019. She was actually really happy because of the compliment she hadn\u2019t heard in a long while.</p><br/><p>\u2018Now that he thought about it, just what had happened?\u2019</p><br/><p>He had only heard the general outline from Cuchulainn.</p><br/><p>She was one of the Goddesses that had submitted herself to protect their loved ones.</p><br/><p>What kind of story was there? And what was the reason she chose the geass \u2018obey your master\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u2018I think they came.\u2019</p><br/><p>Adenmaha, that was forcing back her smile, said with a sharp voice. Tae Ho, that was sharing his senses with her, could also feel it.</p><br/><p>The second wave in the sea, and perhaps the real game by now.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho took a breath once and activated \u2018the warrior that rode on a Valkyrie\u2019. This saga affected the one he was being accompanied just like \u2018the one that controls dragons\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u2018Uh, huh?\u2019</p><br/><p>Adenmaha got surprised blinked and then realized what had happened to her.</p><br/><p>\u2018Va, valkyrie?\u2019</p><br/><p>Granting the strength of a Valkyrie to the one that had let him ride on.</p><br/><p>A feather decoration made of light appeared in Adenmaha\u2019s head. Her body, that was strengthened by \u2018the one that handles dragons\u2019 was strengthened once again.</p><br/><p>And it didn\u2019t stop there. Idun\u2019s blessing spread over Adenmaha\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>[Idun\u2019s Valkyrie(Temporary)]</p><br/><p>[Adenmaha]</p><br/><p>What would happen if he used it on Rolo.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho smiled bitterly and erased his idle thoughts.</p><br/><p>He focused his consciousness on feeling the enemy that was approaching him from below.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 21 \u2013 Midgard (4) &gt; End</p><hr/><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/>\n</div>"}

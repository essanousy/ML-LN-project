It was because they had prioritized some warriors including Tae Ho even though the clearing of the battlefield still hadn\u2019t ended.</p><br/><p>\u201cSiri also returned to rest. Was it Rolph? That friend stayed behind. The damages the dark fairies suffered were large, and it\u2019s also important to investigate the trace of the Great War that was discovered.\u201d</p><br/><p>Maybe it was because she has been next to him until now or it was a coincidence that Heda, that was next to Tae Ho\u2019s headrest, said.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho blinked a few times as if chasing away the sleepiness and asked again.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about the Valkyries?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe investigation is proceeding with Rasgrid commanding them. Reginleif took Garmr\u2019s soul fragment that you discovered to the Gods and there has been no notice since then, and Gandur returned first to lead the warriors of Ullr\u2019s legion.\u201d</p><br/><p>The eyes of Heda became a bit sharp. Because what he was asking was related to the Valkyries.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho lightly ignored her eyes and then rose up.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeda, the things the Giants are aiming for are certainly Garmr\u2019s soul fragment, right? When I fought against it, the monster was a really big dog.\u201d</p><br/><p>After he told her what happened in the trace of the Great War briefly Heda nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Garmr is a big dog that guards the entrance to hell. I was told that it died in the Great War\u2026.. It seems like those fragments are scattered everywhere. Tae Ho, what you faced against should probably be a fragment of its soul.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe original thing should have been incredible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the keeper of hell, the place that everything and everyone go to. It\u2019s a really strong and scary monster.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda\u2019s eyes looked at a distant place. It seemed like she was thinking about Garmr that was in one piece.</p><br/><p>However, she seemed to have shaken off those thoughts that she turned to look at Tae Ho and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt will soon be revealed what the Giants tried to do with the fragments. Although it\u2019s a bit irresponsible to say this, let\u2019s leave it to the higher-ups. I will tell you when the results are up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, that will be good.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was merely curious as to why the giants aimed for this item and what they wanted to do. He would be satisfied just by listening to the results.</p><br/><p>Heda stood up with a nice mood as Tae Ho agreed and then pointed at a basin with warm water that was on the table.</p><br/><p>\u201cWash yourself and get out. After you regain your strengths by eating you have to go meet Idun-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>They would meet Idun as they had returned to the residence.</p><br/><p>A smile appeared on Tae Ho\u2019s face as if it was obvious.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like you like it that you are meeting Idun-nim?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t simply because he was going to meet a Goddess. Because every time he met her she gave him something. And he especially knew what she was going to give him this time.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have to get the flying horse wing coat which she promised last time. It would suit well, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, the one wearing it and the one suiting it wasn\u2019t Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda smiled as if Tae Ho\u2019s gaze wouldn\u2019t work on her and left the room first.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>\u201cMy warrior Tae Ho, you returned safely.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s thanks to Idun-nim\u2019s blessing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho kneeled and expressed his manners. Idun, that was standing below an apple tree, looked down at Tae Ho with warm eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have raised big merits this time too. I have certainly heard that the warriors of Valhalla and you called my name.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed like it was true as her voice was a bit excited. Thanks to that, the divine feeling he felt when he first saw her was cut by it but he didn\u2019t dislike it. He rather liked it because she felt closer.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, my warrior Tae Ho. I will now reward you as promised.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Idun didn\u2019t delay anymore. Tae Ho thanked once again that he belonged to Idun\u2019s legion and raised his head to receive the flying horse wing coat. However, Idun just smiled instead of giving it to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, choose one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI prepared options this time too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Maybe it was his feeling, but he felt a bit of playfulness in her voice. It seemed like she was enjoying that she made Tae Ho surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, one is the wing coat you know well. And the other\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Idun paused for a moment and then took out something that was a bit big. It was an item even Tae Ho could recognize.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a Saddle of the beast.\u201d</p><br/><p>The thing Idun raised her arms with difficulty really was a saddle. Although it was the first time Tae Ho had seen it with his own two eyes he had seen it so much in places like games and movies that it was really familiar to him.</p><br/><p>Idun raised the saddle up with a groaning sound and then patted on it and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a saddle you can put on any kind of beast, monster or bird. It\u2019s because it has transformation magic cast on it. This is also a gift that came from Olympus a long time ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a saddle made of heavy and thick leather and added a red and glossy leather on top of that. And the part you rested your feet also seemed to be sturdy.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will show you some examples, so wait a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Idun flicked her finger, rocks with the shape of animals started to surge up. They were a horse, a pig and a something unknown but was big.</p><br/><p>\u201cSee well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Idun placed the saddle on top of the rocks one by one. And then, just like Idun had said the saddle transformed to become suitable to get on. Lastly, as it was impossible to wear it, it turned to the shape of a chair and got stuck in the rock.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs it\u2019s a saddle, it doesn\u2019t give you a stable riding but it also has controlling magic so it will be easier to control your mount.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was an understandable thing. Because when he rode on the monster on the cave of the dwarves he was troubled because he didn\u2019t have where to seat.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, pick one.\u201d</p><br/><p>Idun spread her two hands. Although he couldn\u2019t see her well because of the light, he was sure that she was smiling.</p><br/><p>\u2018Oh, Idun.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho started to think deeply when he was faced with choices. He was leaning more towards the saddle rather than the wing coat.</p><br/><p>\u2018I need something to ride on with the saddle.\u2019</p><br/><p>The saddles were solely a supportive item. If he didn\u2019t have anything to ride on, then this thing became useless.</p><br/><p>However, Tae Ho thought differently.</p><br/><p>\u2018A saddle you can wear it with anything.\u2019</p><br/><p>Then it became useful. Because Tae Ho already had one wing coat.</p><br/><p>The hawk\u2019s wing coat.</p><br/><p>As it was a coat that let you transform into a hawk, he had used it to transform himself to fly because there was no way someone could ride on it.</p><br/><p>But if he had the Beast\u2019s saddle then that became possible. Through this expedition, he realized that you were able to transform into a big animal if you had enough runes.</p><br/><p>\u2018If it\u2019s captain Siri, she should be able to transform into the size of a human.\u2019</p><br/><p>Because the number of runes she had was already close to being at the intermediate rank.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho thought of Siri transforming into a hawk reflexively. He thought of the warriors riding on big eagles just like in the movies.</p><br/><p>\u2018It will be quite useful.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was indeed useful. In addition, if he stored it in Unnir then he would be able to use it on a wild monster, or take the beast of the enemy and use it for himself.</p><br/><p>\u2018There\u2019s nothing else to think about.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho made a fast decision and spoke to Idun.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will choose the Beast\u2019s saddle.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. The wing coat should be regretful, but it\u2019s unavoidable. Another chance will come someday.\u201d</p><br/><p>Idun agreed freshly and then kissed Tae Ho on his forehead after giving him the saddle.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy warrior Tae Ho. My strength shall accompany you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The now familiar power of Idun covered Tae Ho\u2019s body. Tae Ho closed his eyes with a satisfied face.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you have a nice meeting?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou received something.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he got out of the shrine he saw Heda and Ragnar waiting for him. As Ragnar glanced at the saddle that was in Tae Ho\u2019s arms, he smirked and explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a Beast saddle. You can use it on any beast and it\u2019s said to also help you in controlling it.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he raised it as if it was worth it, Ragnar nodded slowly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like she\u2019s in deep thought regarding what you need. You are really being treated well.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was an adequate reward for Tae Ho that faced several things. You could only think that she prepared it especially for him.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho thanked Idun and nodded. Thinking about it, all of this was thanks to Idun\u2019s legion being small in number.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst of all\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar looked Tae Ho up and down and let out a small exclamation.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou became really strong. The number of runes you have increased by a lot. I should move up with the pace of the training of the strength of a God by quite a lot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even Ragnar hadn\u2019t expected for a warrior that had just become inferior ranked to become close to being an intermediate warrior at once. Just like he had said, he should hurry with teaching him about the strength of a God.</p><br/><p>However, Heda stepped up at that moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, but let\u2019s rest for today. Resume the training tomorrow. Looking at it, it hasn\u2019t even been a day since the battle ended.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Tae Ho fell asleep it was the afternoon, but it was morning right now. As he was quite sturdy, also had Idun\u2019s blessing and in addition, rested in the residence of Idun\u2019s legion that had a higher recovery rate, so there was a high chance that Siri may still be lying on the bed.</p><br/><p>Ragnar stepped back simply to the point that it was unexpected.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, resting is also important. It would be good to let him rest today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, will the two of you help me organize the items?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Tae Ho spoke, the two of them tilted their heads as if asking him what he meant. Tae Ho just opened up Unnir instead of replying.</p><br/><p>Several weapons of different kinds were lined up in the floor of the classroom. Ragnar looked at the dozens of weapons and laughed as it didn\u2019t make sense.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have a warehouse we don\u2019t know of?\u201d</p><br/><p>Actually, it was easy to distinguish that these weapons were items picked up from the trace of the Great War. However Tae Ho didn\u2019t only take the weapons that were in a good state, he had also taken the broken weapons differently to a normal warrior.</p><br/><p>Heda, that was checking the weapons while sitting on the ground, opened her eyes sharply as if she was appraising and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are all magic weapons. You brought them from the trace of the Great War?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I only picked the ones that had magic engraved on them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda and also Ragnar knew about Tae Ho\u2019s \u2018sword of the warrior\u2019. Thanks to that they didn\u2019t ask him why he had brought these broken weapons.</p><br/><p>Ragnar looked at the daggers that were closest to him and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is only my thought but I think that it will be better to return them to their respective legions. There should be many historical weapons among them.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were lost articles before it became looting for Tae Ho. The dagger he just grabbed had the symbol of Hermod\u2019s legion engraved on it.</p><br/><p>In addition, it was a question whether he needed another weapon when he already had the Unknown sword piece.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, that should be for the best.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Tae Ho nodded obediently Heda put on a slightly surprised and a happy face.</p><br/><p>However, Heda\u2019s thoughts weren\u2019t as pure as Ragna or Tae Ho. She exchanged glances once and then Ragna smirked once and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe rewards will be quite good. As they also have a face to care for.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t normal artifacts, but artifacts from the warriors that participated in the Great War. And all of them were magical weapons and were also historical just like Ragnar had said.</p><br/><p>He would give them the broken, unusable and useless weapons and receive new items.</p><br/><p>And as Idun\u2019s legion wasn\u2019t in need of many weapons it was also a great benefit for him.</p><br/><p>Heda looked at Tae Ho and Ragnar looking at themselves and smiling satisfactorily and then let out a sigh comparable to her expectation.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho called at that Heda.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, Heda. There\u2019s something I want to ask.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan I get something to ride on? I think that it will be good to have a fixed mount. Even if it\u2019s not a flying thing, something like the horses the dark fairies rode on\u2026.or the White silences of Ullr\u2019s legion.\u201d</p><br/><p>He did think of Siri reflexively when he picked the saddle, but Siri wasn\u2019t Tae Ho\u2019s mount. She was also a prestigious warrior of Valhalla.</p><br/><p>Depending on each situation, riding on her would be the best and perhaps he may be able to ask her a few more times but that would be all. Rather than relying on Siri, getting a mount for himself was also proper for Siri.</p><br/><p>Heda smacked her lips at Tae Ho\u2019s question and then frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, Idun\u2019s legion doesn\u2019t have a particular summon like Ullr\u2019s legion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ullr was the God of hunting, and Idun was the Goddess of life and youth.</p><br/><p>Ragnar put down the dagger he was touching and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s a simple thing like a horse you can just buy it in Anaheim, or you can request for one and get it but its lacking. You aren\u2019t going to use it as a transportation means.\u201d</p><br/><p>Actually, that was true. He did speak of a horse but if it was a normal one like the one the dark fairies used, then he didn\u2019t feel the use of it. Of course, it would be better than not having anything, but thinking about how painful it would be to take care of it, it wasn\u2019t that great.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is that unavoidable?\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho decided to give up. Because if he just dragged it, Heda would just feel more sorry.</p><br/><p>But it was then.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo I was saying, shall we go catch one?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar said. He saved his words as if enjoying the looks given by Tae Ho and Heda and then shrugged his shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will catch a wild gryphon. I know a place in the boundary between Asgard and Olympus where gryphons live. We can just catch one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><br/><p>If it was a gryphon then the story changed. It could fly in the sky and it wasn\u2019t only stronger than a horse, its battle power was also quite great.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut only, the trip takes some time. Heda will know if it will be possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Basically, the warriors of Valhalla were always in a standby state. Ragnar was asking her if she could regulate the tasks so he wasn\u2019t called and then Heda nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will do what I can.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed like she had become quite determined that even her eyes had become sharp.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s been decided. Let\u2019s depart as soon as Heda solves things. I think that it will be good to train the strength of a God on the trip.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at how he spoke, it seemed like that place wasn\u2019t reachable through a space door. It seemed like they had to travel an additional distance just like what happened in Svartalfheim.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m getting excited.\u2019</p><br/><p>He would go catch a gryphon he would ride from now on. He felt happy just by talking about it.</p><br/><p>He felt that it was an adventure more than a simple expedition.</p><br/><p>Ragnar kept talking about gryphons and separated the weapons by their legions at the same time. And as Heda also helped him, they could finish sorting the items in a few minutes.</p><br/><p>Odin, Thor, Tir, Ullr, Hermod, Heimdal, Vidarr. Seven legions in total.</p><br/><p>There was only one item left among the dozens of lined weapons.</p><br/><p>The Unknown piece of equipment.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this the same kind as the Sword piece?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, I don\u2019t know whose God this belongs to.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar and Heda spoke after checking the fragment once.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho looked at the Unknown sword piece that was in his waist but there was no reaction this time.</p><br/><p>\u2018Perhaps, it may be from another world.\u2019</p><br/><p>What Siri had said.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho took in a deep breath when he received the Piece of equipment from Heda. He gripped it tightly and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will check.\u201d</p><br/><p>What he could do with this.</p><br/><p>[Saga: Sword of the warrior]</p><br/><p>Tae Ho activated his saga. And at that moment, something no one had expected happened.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 14 \u2013 Garmr\u2019s soul fragment (2) &gt; End</p><br/>\n</div>"}

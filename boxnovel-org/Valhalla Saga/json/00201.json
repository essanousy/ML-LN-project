He belonged to the generation before that, so to say the race of Titans.</p><br/><p>He was a being that wanted to maintain the world compared to most of the Titans that were born as beings that destroy to maintain the world.</p><br/><p>Because of that, as soon as Titanomachy took place he sided with Zeus along his brother Epimetheus and the result of that was that they could keep their seats as God even after Titanomachy.</p><br/><p>But actually, the reason he sided up with Zeus wasn\u2019t only because he was born as a being that wanted to maintain the world.</p><br/><p>It was a truth that wasn\u2019t known well in Titanomachy but Prometheus had a strong ability of foresight.</p><br/><p>But of course that wasn\u2019t absolute. It was a strength that was similar to what the three sisters and the head of Mymir did and Odin read fate through them.</p><br/><p>But there was one difference between Odin and Prometheus.</p><br/><p>If Odin had gathered several foresights and speculated the probabilities, Prometheus\u2019 foresight didn\u2019t have a process like this.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why his foresight was unstable.</p><br/><p>He could make a foresight without any information compared to Odin but he wasn\u2019t able to do it everywhere and anywhere.</p><br/><p>Even if he saw the same person there were times that it became foresight and times that it didn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>But regardless of this instability, Prometheus\u2019 foresight was still powerful. There were few cases that her performed foresight but what he did foresee became true unconditionally.</p><br/><p>So you could say that his preciseness in foresight was higher than Odin even though the requisites were more picky and the targets were limited.</p><br/><p>He had foreseen that Zeus would win in Titanomachy and that had actually happened.</p><br/><p>He also succeeded in several foresights aside of that and the result of that was that he became an existence like a chicken rib.</p><br/><p>Someone that was certainly useful but uneasy.</p><br/><p>The words that came out from the foreseer weren\u2019t always good ones. Believing only in good foresights and not wanting to believe the bad ones only gave you peace but it wasn\u2019t of any help.</p><br/><p>Because of that, the foreseer became more hated the more precise his foresights were.</p><br/><p>It was also like this with Prometheus.</p><br/><p>Zeus didn\u2019t like him. He had seen fun in Titanomachy thanks to his foresights but had also sensed the danger it posed.</p><br/><p>Prometheus shut his mouth to live under Zeus. He didn\u2019t make any foresights after Titanomachy as if his ability had disappeared and acted as a master with excellent handicrafting skills.</p><br/><p>Actually, he was the blacksmith God that represented Olympus before Hephaestus was born.</p><br/><p>His tragedy started when the humans started to strode out on the world.</p><br/><p>The reason the Gods of Olympus had a more perpendicular relationship with the humans compared to the Gods of other worlds was because in the first place the 12 Olympians had created them as their toys and tools.</p><br/><p>Prometheus created humans after he received an order from Zeus and he really loved and treasured them. You could say that he treasured them as a parent treasuring his children.</p><br/><p>He wanted to gift the humans the most things he could but Zeus was displeased with his wishes. It was because he knew of Erin\u2019s case where humans and Gods were on equal standing.</p><br/><p>For Zeus humans were livestock like pigs and dogs and he wanted to maintain that relationship.</p><br/><p>But Prometheus couldn\u2019t understand that thought of his and didn\u2019t want to understand it.</p><br/><p>He finally determined himself and stole the first fire from the smithy of Hephaestus and gave it to the humans. Hephaestus noticed his doings but he respected him as he was his master and the previous blacksmith God and pretended not to have seen anything.</p><br/><p>When the humans got their hands on the first fire, they developed at a fast speed like the humans of the other worlds and there were some heroes that had outstanding strength and wisdom.</p><br/><p>Zeus got to know what happened in the ground so he confined him and tied him up in a rock behind a cliff for eternity out of rage</p><br/><p>Prometheus also got enraged at his actions that he made his first foresight since Titanomachy.</p><br/><p>That Zeus will get his seat taken by his children one day just like what happened with his father Chronos.</p><br/><p>Zeus got enraged once again at his prophecy that was close to a curse and added the punishment of having his liver eaten by eagles everyday while he was still alive.</p><br/><p>Prometheus was under extreme pain in a state that he wasn\u2019t dead nor alive and his pain continued until Heracles passed near that place to accomplish the 12 quests.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat time should easily last thousands and hundreds of years.\u201d</p><br/><p>The muse of poetry Calliope said as if singing. Her voice wasn\u2019t simply beautiful but it also contained the pain, despair and grief Prometheus should have felt so everyone got depressed after they listened to her story.</p><br/><p>\u201cPoor\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg said while embracing Hydra and Hydra also nodded. The two people felt sympathy to the ones that had been confined for a long time.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing much happened after he got released?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bracky asked with a compassionate voice. He got moved at the punishment of the Gods that were on a different scale.</p><br/><p>Calliope put a faint smile and nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, he just lived quietly. In addition, he also told Zeus the method to avoid the last foresight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid he tell him who was the mother of the one that would defeat him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri gave out an answer after a while of pondering. It was because that was the only way to avoid the foresight.</p><br/><p>Calliope smiled brightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right and that person is Thetis. The mother of the Great hero Achilles, the sea nymph.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reason Zeus gave up on Thetis like Poseidon and made her marry a human was to avoid Prometheus\u2019 prophecy.</p><br/><p>Siri put a weird expression as she had already heard things about Achilles but there were some that were putting up disliking expressions.</p><br/><p>And the one that was putting that expression was none other than Hermes.</p><br/><p>\u201cHermes, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bracky asked as he couldn\u2019t endure things he was curious about so everyone turned to look at Hermes after that. Hermes frowned even more and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like him. I was the one that heard how to avoid that foresight which Calliope spoke about\u2026..but he merely listened to me after he tried all sorts of things. Is stubborness is really great.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hermes had visited Prometheus thousands of times in the time he was imprisoned. It was because Zeus was that afraid of his foresight.</p><br/><p>\u201cHermes,how do you look at him putting aside the personal likes and dislikes?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hermes frowned for a moment at Tae Ho\u2019s question and then shrugged his shoulders and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, he is skilled indeed. He was also the previous blacksmith God before Hephaestus hyung-nim. Foresight is a really useful thing in war.\u201d</p><br/><p>In addition, they were facing against Zeus and the other 12 Olympians. There was the probability he would help them with all his strength as much as the grudge he had towards Zeus.</p><br/><p>\u201cCalliope, tell him that we will meet him right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><br/><p>Calliope expressed etiquette gracefully and left the room. And after some minutes passed. The time they had to wait was short as Prometheus had already come to look for Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrometheus greets the master of Asgard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNice to meet you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho sat on a throne while being accompanied by Siri, Bracky, Adenmaha, Nidhogg, etc at his side and greeted Prometheus.</p><br/><p>He was a Titan but it seemed like he was a small Titan like Loki that he was seen as a tall person had a really sharp impression. His eyes were especially strong and it was burdensome to face him directly.</p><br/><p>But he couldn\u2019t evade his eyes because of that. Tae Ho faced Prometheus for a moment and Prometheus put a smile not long after that.</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>He spoke briefly and erased his smile. He spoke while still maintaining his sharp eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe fate of Olympus is split and the one that will decide that fate is you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He could know that it was a foresight as soon as he heard it.</p><br/><p>But Hermes snorted and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you kidding? I should also be able to say that much. That\u2019s a really obvious thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, that is indeed the case.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bracky also added.</p><br/><p>Because it was really obvious just like Hermes had said.</p><br/><p>If Tae Ho hadn\u2019t been here Olympus would have already fallen to the hands of the beings wanting to destroy the world.</p><br/><p>Was there a meaning to say that Tae Ho would be the existence to decide the fate of Olympus?</p><br/><p>Prometheus didn\u2019t get shaken at all even at Hermes\u2019 critique. He continued speaking with a confident voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour fate is connected with many people and the one that has the strongest connection among the ones gathered here is that one.\u201d</p><br/><p>Prometheus raised his hand and pointed at one side.</p><br/><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was to Adenmaha that was standing right next to Tae Ho. She got surprised at the sudden marking out and Prometheus nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehehe\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha\u2019s face loosened in an instant. She lowered her head trying to hide her red face but anyone could notice that she was smirking.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about Nidhogg? Is Nidhogg also connected to Tae Ho master?\u201d</p><br/><p>Prometheus opened his eyes sharply at Nidhogg\u2019s question and then nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are also connected.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? How fun.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg also started to smile like a fool. She didn\u2019t lower her head like Adenmaha so you could clearly see that she was really happy.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hey, isn\u2019t he just throwing random stuff? To increase people that will side with him.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was when Cuchulainn spoke with a doubtful voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about me? Do I also have a strong connection with master?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Drakon Ismenios asked in a really excited state, Prometheus frowned and shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you sorry about! Sob sob sob.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018He wasn\u2019t just throwing random things.\u2019</p><br/><p>Actually, almost everyone in this room was connected by fate with Tae Ho. There were only differences in how strong the connection was and the one with the strongest connection was Adenmaha and Ismenios had the weakest.</p><br/><p>Prometheus spoke once again while Drakon Ismenios lamented by himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster of Asgard. The reason I came here to find you is to save the humans I love.\u201d</p><br/><p>The humans didn\u2019t serve Prometheus that hadn\u2019t only created them but also sent them the fire knowing that he would get a heavy punishment.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t a shrine for him no matter where you went in Olympus while Zeus and the other 12 Olympians did.</p><br/><p>But Prometheus didn\u2019t care about that. He still loved the humans. There were always conditions on a love of a parent.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe biggest threat right now should be Poseidon. He\u2019s actually advancing to the south so you must clash with him in not too long.\u201d</p><br/><p>A week had already passed since they defeated Artemis. Poseidon was slowly but certainly advancing towards the polis of Apollo.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you have an advice I will gladly listen to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Prometheus took a breath as Tae Ho spoke with etiquette. You could see that he was quite bewildered. It seemed like he hadn\u2019t thought that the master of Asgard would treat him with this much respect.</p><br/><p>Prometheus looked at Tae Ho with still sharp eyes but that now had hospitality in it.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, the master of Asgard, are certainly strong. But you won\u2019t be able to defeat Poseidon in your current state. I assure you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t simply speaking because Poseidon\u2019s divine power was stronger than Ares or Artemis.</p><br/><p>He had split Olympus into three and divided it between Zeus and Hades.</p><br/><p>Because of that, his sacred force was different to the other Gods of Olympus that were based on the polises. It wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to say that Olympus itself was their sacred force.</p><br/><p>Destroying the nucleus of the sacred force and weakening him just like he did with Artemis wouldn\u2019t work.</p><br/><p>It was also impossible to isolate him like Ares as he could bring out unlimited strength from his vast territory, the sea.</p><br/><p>A frontal battle was the only way to win.</p><br/><p>Prometheus\u2019 words weren\u2019t wrong. Poseidon\u2019s power surpassed Tae Ho, that had just become the master. Even if he transformed into the World dragon, his probabilities to lose were higher than his probabilities to win.</p><br/><p>But Tae Ho didn\u2019t lose his composure. It was because he had already checked Poseidon\u2019s strength several times.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf there was no way to win in the first place, you wouldn\u2019t have spoken like how. What do I have to do to win?\u201d</p><br/><p>If he was telling him to give up because there was no way to win, he wouldn\u2019t have even come to look for him.</p><br/><p>Prometheus showed a smile as it was like Tae Ho had thought and then spoke after approaching Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need Hephaestus\u2019 assistance to defeat Poseidon. Only he can make a weapon to defeat Poseidon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know where he is at?\u201d</p><br/><p>The one that reacted first was Hermes. It was an obvious reaction as he had roamed several places looking for him.</p><br/><p>Prometheus turned to look at Hermes for a moment and nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cI do but I can\u2019t rescue him alone. I need your strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will listen to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were planning to rescue Hephaestus anyways. But now they would have to rescue him for certain if he was able to make a weapon that could defeat Poseidon.</p><br/><p>Poseidon drooped his shoulders as if he relaxed at Tae Ho\u2019s positive reaction. He let out a sigh and spoke with an eased voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe place Hephaestus is captured at is Cyprus. The base of APhrodite.\u201d</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 59 \u2013 God of conquest (3) &gt; End</p><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/>\n</div>"}

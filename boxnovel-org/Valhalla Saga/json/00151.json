He didn\u2019t collapse after using the last of his strength but he looked to be at his limits as if he would break down at any moment.</p><br/><p>Odin shed tears. The tears that fell for the first time in a hundred years didn\u2019t know when to stop.</p><br/><p>He knew it.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t wish it and it needed a procedure that several conditions had to be met.</p><br/><p>But in the end it ended up happening.</p><br/><p>What would Loki do and what kind of fate would he face.</p><br/><p>At the end of the Great war.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t able to stop him when Loki said that he would enter the ranks of the magician king.</p><br/><p>But he ended up relying on his sacrifice.</p><br/><p>And this was the same.</p><br/><p>He had come to rescue Loki but in the end he made himself die.</p><br/><p>The foolish yet clear king of Gods.</p><br/><p>The cruel and sly God of war.</p><br/><p>Odin clenched his chest. He grabbed his chest that seemed like it would tear at any moment and raised his head. He turned to look up at the world wolf that was roaring in rage.</p><br/><p>\u201cWin.\u201d</p><br/><p>As it was the last stage Loki had made.</p><br/><p>It would be the last opportunity.</p><br/><p>The magician king vomited blood because of the lethal blow that was inflicted with the explosion of the absorption.</p><br/><p>The world wolf, that seemed to have no consciousness, seemed to have detected the death of its father and increased its size in an instant and got more enraged.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg passed over Odin\u2019s head and Hraesvelg\u2019s big wings covered the land with its shadow.</p><br/><p>The ancient dragon and the king of birds.</p><br/><p>They would be able to cope with the world wolf if it was the two of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease win.\u201d</p><br/><p>For Loki.</p><br/><p>For Asgard and the nine realms!</p><br/><p>The black dragon fired a breath filled with poison and a green current rushed towards the world wolf.</p><br/><p>The giant kings and the superior warriors of Valhalla clashed. Strong existences filled the space that got emptied after the evil spirits disappeared after the magic the magician king used.</p><br/><p>Witacheon charged like a gale. Bracky awakened as the son of a God and fired lightning. Siri transformed into a wolf Goddess and put Ullr\u2019s divine power on her arrows.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy king!\u201d</p><br/><p>Avalt, that was hidden in the shadows, showed himself and the giant of Sea also appeared not far away from him. They tried to run towards the world wolf that was covered in poison.</p><br/><p>But Bracky and Siri stopped the giant of Night.</p><br/><p>Witacheon intercepted the path of the giant of Sea.</p><br/><p>The structure of the battlefield changed. The hole that got made in the center spun around it as the center. It seemed like a hole was made in a tub filled with water. The strong ones were starting to gather more and more.</p><br/><p>Njord and Heimdall that were maintaining their ranks at other places advanced like waves. Tauchi and the other giant kings also increased their speed.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg occupied the sky above the head of the world wolf and the black dragon held the second poison breath instead of rushing recklessly.</p><br/><p>It was the correct option.</p><br/><p>[Saga: The jaw of the world wolf]</p><br/><p>The sky and the ground split. The huge jaw of the wolf gulped down everything in its path including the poison.</p><br/><p>The evil spirits and giants got erased.</p><br/><p>The warriors of Valhalla that were fighting against them also disappeared.</p><br/><p>It was an overwhelming power of destruction- no, annihilation. Hraesvelg generated a strong wind with his wings. He pressed down the world wolf from above and at the same time fired his feathers that were like blades.</p><br/><p>The black dragon moved sideways to dodge the jaw of the world wolf and fired a poison breath once again. The world wolf acted calm as if the poison didn\u2019t pose a problem to him at all but it was the same as Hrumbak. The poison would certainly show its effects in the later stages.</p><br/><p>In addition, the magician king wasn\u2019t the world wolf. He had to desperately use magic to block the poison even while he was vomiting black blood.</p><br/><p>Loki! Loki! Loki!</p><br/><p>The magician king screamed in rage and that rage reached to the one that was standing on the head of the black dragon.</p><br/><p>Idun\u2019s warrior.</p><br/><p>The commander of Idun!</p><br/><p>The world wolf roared once again and moved. He went against the gale generated by Hraesvelg with his overwhelming power. He received the falling feathers with its body and took a leap but the height of that jump transcended imagination.</p><br/><p>The world wolf bit the empty air. It was the place Hraesvelg was at just now. Hraesvelg barely managed to dodge the attack of the world wolf by twisting his body and dripped cold sweat. The physical abilities of the world wolf had transcended his expectations.</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard!\u201d</p><br/><p>But he couldn\u2019t lose to it. Hraesvelg let out a cry and charged towards it. It was to deal a blow to the wolf that couldn\u2019t move freely in the air.</p><br/><p>The world wolf looked at him and it didn\u2019t move its body on purpose. It rather glared at Hraesvelg and released a strong magic power.</p><br/><p>[Saga: The one that conceived a catastrophe]</p><br/><p>The cry of a queen banshee exploded in the air. It wasn\u2019t a cry that spread everywhere but was only directed to Hraesvelg.</p><br/><p>The invisible strength hit Hraesvelg. Hraesvelg twisted his body instead of facing the attack head on. It was a wise judgement. The world wolf bit the air this time too and fell.</p><br/><p>And the black dragon charged towards it. It wanted to bite down the world wolf that was defenseless because it used consecutive skills towards Hraesvelg.</p><br/><p>The black dragon bit the stomach of the world wolf and the world wolf bit the neck of the black dragon.</p><br/><p>They both crashed in the ground. The world wolf gnawed at the neck of the dragon. The teeth of the black dragon bit the stomach of the world wolf but it couldn\u2019t gnaw on it.</p><br/><p>But it was enough.</p><br/><p>Because the one that got tangled with the wolf was the fake one. The black dragon stroke its wing and opened its mouth widely to bite down the neck of the world wolf that had now become as big as the black dragon.</p><br/><p>The world wolf laughed with its eyes. It looked at the black dragon and opened its mouth like it. It was to face each other once again.</p><br/><p>[Saga: The warrior that had a Goddess meet him]</p><br/><p>Right at that moment the saga got activated. The location of the fake dragon that was about to disappear because its strength got almost used up changed with Nidhogg. She then fired a poison breath towards the world wolf that had approached her in an instant and then bit its body.</p><br/><p>They were the teeth of a real black dragon.</p><br/><p>The world wolf made an action filled with madness compared to before that only had its leather pierced. It put strength in its legs and moved its body by its own. The piece of flesh that got bitten got ripped off forcefully and then turned itself to bite the neck of the black dragon.</p><br/><p>A big wound was made in the stomach of the world wolf and the poison of the black dragon entered the body of the world wolf.</p><br/><p>But the wolf didn\u2019t care about it. It destroyed the scales of the dragon with its teeth and then bit the flesh.</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg screamed at the unbearable pain. Tae Ho hurriedly cut off the connection with Nidhogg\u2019s body with \u2018the one that controls dragon\u2019s. He called the fake Nidhogg next to himself and changed its location with the real Nidhogg. He embraced Nidhogg that had started to cry while grabbing her neck and jumped from the head of the black dragon.</p><br/><p>A strong poison got released from the body of the black dragon after Nidhogg left it. Green poison covered the body of the world wolf in an instant.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho leaped in the sky consecutively and looked at the sky. Hraesvelg was gathering strength. It was to deal a decisive blow to the world wolf that lost strength because it suffered a big injury.</p><br/><p>[Saga: The one that conceived a catastrophe]</p><br/><p>[Saga: The jaw of the world wolf]</p><br/><p>Two sagas got activated at the same time. The cry of the queen banshee scattered the poison and the jaw of the world wolf swept down the sky and the ground.</p><br/><p>The eyes of the world wolf got had blood congested in it. It\u2019s breathing was rough and an overwhelming amount of blood flowed from the wound of its stomach.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg charged towards that world wolf. He drew a trajectory between the two sagas that was close to perfection. It was a body slam. It was an attack that fired off his body, that emanated magic power, like a projectile.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg surged to the air.</p><br/><p>The king of the white birds- his huge body clashed against the world wolf.</p><br/><p>The world wolf screamed. It got tangled with Hraesvelg and got sent flying a few kilometres. Just its aftereffects made everything in its surroundings disappear.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg stood in the air and breathed roughly. Tae Ho, that was still embracing Nidhogg, gripped the summoning rock and at that moment Rolo and Adenmaha got summoned and after they transformed into dragons they fired the right of the king.</p><br/><p>The world wolf couldn\u2019t dodge it this time either. The ice and fire breath covered it.</p><br/><p>But it didn\u2019t fall. It stood its messy and bloody body up. Its body that had grown to become as big as the black dragon shrunk once again to become a few meters big and had even received lethal damage but it didn\u2019t fall down.</p><br/><p>It was a nasty vitality. In addition, the magician king was riding on its back. He started to recite a chant with a maddened voice after he shook away the after effects of the magic.</p><br/><p>The world wolf charged forward while losing blood.</p><br/><p>The strong curse magic became five spheres to roam the surroundings of the world wolf and the wolf charged forward. He rushed towards Tae Ho at an overwhelming speed.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg flew towards Tae Ho. Tae Ho understood his intention and threw Nidhogg to the air. When Hraesvelg snatched Nidhogg in the air and embraced her, Tae Ho faced the spheres of curse head on. He swung the sword he was holding with strength!</p><br/><p>[Saga: Sword of the sun]</p><br/><p>The sword Gallatin of the sun knight Gawain.</p><br/><p>They were almost in the afternoon so the power of the saga greatly amplified Tae Ho\u2019s divine power. The huge blade of sun made with golden light swept out the curse spheres.</p><br/><p>Kwagagagang!</p><br/><p>Fierce explosions fired off in consecution.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha and Rolo threw themselves towards the world wolf. The world wolf used the \u2018jaw of the world wolf\u2019 but Rolo twisted his body and dodged the attack. Adenmaha fired an ice breath on the head of the world wolf. She then landed on the ground and swiped her tail towards the world wolf- precisely speaking towards the giant king riding on its waist.</p><br/><p>But it didn\u2019t happen.</p><br/><p>She did delay the world wolf for a moment thanks to her ice breath but the tail sweep went wrong.</p><br/><p>The giant king grabbed Adenmaha\u2019s tail. He showed his strength even though he was at the verge of dying. Adenmaha couldn\u2019t pull her tail away. She rather received a strong curse directly through her tail. Several magical runes appeared on the body of Adenmaha.</p><br/><p>She hurriedly transformed back into a Goddess. Thanks to that she was able to get out of the hands of the magician king but part of the curse still remained on her. In addition, she wasn\u2019t able to endure the attacks of the world wolf and magician king even for a moment when she was in her Goddess appearance.</p><br/><p>The magician king moved his body and threw part of his magical power.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha activated some mystical magic but she was late. The curse that had already infiltrated her body slowed down her movements.</p><br/><p>\u201cAdenmaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho yelled. Adenmaha was late but that wasn\u2019t the case for TAe Ho. He called back Adenmaha with the summoning rock.</p><br/><p>The magic power of the magician king destroyed the ground. At that moment, the world wolf charged towards Tae Ho. The distance was now short between them.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha collapsed at Tae Ho\u2019s feet. He didn\u2019t have the time to deal with her so he stood in front of her to try to endure. The world wolf vomited blood once again while charging. Rolo fired his breath towards the world wolf by approaching it.</p><br/><p>The magician king didn\u2019t allow any more obstructions. He left world wolf to face Rolo and then charged towards Tae Ho. He swung his two arms and fired a strong curse!</p><br/><p>Tae Ho made a quick judgement.</p><br/><p>He raised Caliburn instead of Gallatin. Gallatin was the strongest sword he had right now but he had to protect in this moment. He had to endure the curse with his entire body as he couldn\u2019t leave Adenmaha\u2019s side. He needed the holy glory of Caliburn rather than the power of the sun.</p><br/><p>[Saga: King of Camelot]</p><br/><p>The glory of Camelot emanated its light. He raised up his sword and emitted his strength and an invisible wall was formed and blocked the power of the curse.</p><br/><p>But it didn\u2019t end at that. The magician king landed in the ground and extended his arms forward after letting a roar. His posture was one that was pressing down at Tae Ho and Adenmaha.</p><br/><p>The magic power of the magician king became one stage stronger. It seemed like the curse also became stronger because of its influence that Adenmaha let out a groan and struggled.</p><br/><p>The world wolf bit down a wing of Rolo and made him crash down.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg screamed. Hraesvelg, that was about to send her to a safe place, hurriedly turned to look at Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>Avalt put on a complacent smile even while facing Siri and Bracky.</p><br/><p>Grund laughed and Witacheon let out a scream.</p><br/><p>Perhaps it was an obvious thing.</p><br/><p>Even though he had received lethal damage, he was still the magician king.</p><br/><p>And the one that was at his side was the world wolf that would bring destruction to the world.</p><br/><p>Die and disappear like this.</p><br/><p>The nightmare like existence, Idun\u2019s warrior!</p><br/><p>The magician king vomited black blood and amplified his magical power even more. It was to end Tae Ho before a rescuing hand came to help him.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha moved her lips. She had said to leave her behind but the words couldn\u2019t be formed. No, even if they did get formed Tae Ho would never leave her behind.</p><br/><p>He had to endure. He had to somehow disperse the magic power of the magician king.</p><br/><p>Odin recited a chant with difficulty but the existence of the world wolf obstructed with his magic.</p><br/><p>Siri used the opening Bracky striked the giant of Night with all his strength and ran towards Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho\u2019s knees bent.</p><br/><p>The pressing power became much stronger.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg cried. The king of the depths of the earth Tromber surged up from the ground and blocked Siri and Hraesvelg.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn let out a roar. He yelled to Tae Ho to not give up.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho activated the sentence of the Milesians. Idun cried and gave him more strength.</p><br/><p>The glory of Camelot.</p><br/><p>The light of Camelot!</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t enough.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho knew it more than anyone else.</p><br/><p>Heda cried. Adenmaha barely activated a mystical power even while panting. She tried to assist Tae Ho with the little strength she had.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tae Ho, my warrior Tae Ho!\u2019</p><br/><p>Idun\u2019s voice reached him and Heda\u2019s cry was heard.</p><br/><p>And right at that moment.</p><br/><p>When Adenmaha\u2019s mystical power reached Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>A voice was heard through the sentence of the Milesian.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>It was a moment that seemed like eternity.</p><br/><p>It was a memory left in Caliburn. No, it would be good to call it as a remnant of the soul.</p><br/><p>He called out to Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>And told tae Ho.</p><br/><p>[Synchro Rate: 79%]</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t enough yet. That was the reason he wasn\u2019t able to hear the voice even though he had held Caliburn for a long time.</p><br/><p>But right at this moment his voice reached him.</p><br/><p>It may be a miracle made by Idun\u2019s and Heda\u2019s eagerness.</p><br/><p>It may be a necessity created by Adenmaha\u2019s hope.</p><br/><p>No, everything.</p><br/><p>The miracle made at that moment when the hope of the girls and the yell of Cuchulainn became one.</p><br/><p>[Synchro rate: 80%]</p><br/><p>He told him.</p><br/><p>And showed Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>Caliburn\u2019s real strength.</p><br/><p>The real strength only the successor of Erin could emit.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho knew who he was.</p><br/><p>The king of Camelot.</p><br/><p>The owner of the Fairy god sword, the pinnacle of Erin that leads the knights of the round table.</p><br/><p>He remembered the first time Tae Ho pulled Caliburn.</p><br/><p>He had also witnessed the remaining souls of the knights of the round table sacrifice themselves to save Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>Mordred had died. There was no knight of the round table anymore. The only thing that remained in the world was the remnant of king Arthur.</p><br/><p>But it was enough.</p><br/><p>King Arthur spoke to Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cCaliburn got broken once long ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>It became unusable after being destroyed. Because of that King Arthur needed a new sword.</p><br/><p>He followed Merlin\u2019s advice and went to find the fairy of the lake and she gave him a new god sword to him.</p><br/><p>The Fairy god sword Excalibur.</p><br/><p>The strongest holy sword of Erin that represents the king of Camelot.</p><br/><p>The day king Arthur lost his day and Erin got destroyed, Excalibur disappeared. Merlin looked for it for a long time but couldn\u2019t find it.</p><br/><p>It was an obvious thing.</p><br/><p>It was because there was a secret only king Arthur and the fairy of the lake knew.</p><br/><p>The fairy of the lake granted strength to Caliburn.</p><br/><p>It gathered the moonlight and starlight to refine Caliburn and gave birth to Excalibur.</p><br/><p>Excalibur lost its light the day king Arthur died. It lost its strength and returned to be Caliburn once again.</p><br/><p>The story of king Arthur was simple and at the same time a useless one.</p><br/><p>Erin didn\u2019t exist anymore.</p><br/><p>The holy lake and the fairy of the lake also didn\u2019t exist.</p><br/><p>But king Arthur shook his head. He smiled in that moment that seemed like eternity and shrugged his shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t you have her?\u201d</p><br/><p>The existence that was like the fairy of the lake.</p><br/><p>Someone that would give him strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s now time to hatch from your egg new king of Camelot, successor of Erin.\u201d</p><br/><p>The remnant of king Arthur smiled. He then became light and disappeared.</p><br/><p>[Synchro rate: 81%]</p><br/><p>The moment of eternity ended.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho put strength in his hand wielding Caliburn. He gritted his teeth and glared at the magician king.</p><br/><p>What king Arthur taught him.</p><br/><p>What was added to Caliburn.</p><br/><p>[Saga: Idun\u2019s warrior]</p><br/><p>The affectious golden light and power of the Goddess.</p><br/><p>The power of Idun got added to Caliburn and then woke up the real form of Caliburn just like the fairy of the lake did.</p><br/><p>What started to shine then.</p><br/><p>And what woke up.</p><br/><p>The real glory of Camelot.</p><br/><p>A strong light got released and the real sword of liberation opened its eyes.</p><br/><p>The Fairy god sword Excalibur.</p><br/><p>A divine sword of Erin that had the power of Asgard added to it!</p><br/><p>The magician king opened his eyes widely. He had already seen the light emanating in front of him before.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why he wasn\u2019t able to believe it and that\u2019s why he let out a roar.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy king.\u201d</p><br/><p>Merlin, that was fighting from a distant place, started to cry and Scathach also did the same. They shuddered because of the light of Erin that they thought they wouldn\u2019t be able to see anymore.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha cried. Cuchulainn laughed loudly and also cried.</p><br/><p>But they weren\u2019t the only ones. Everyone that had witnessed the destruction of Erin a hundred years ago remembered it. They didn\u2019t forget the shiny light that was like the morning glory.</p><br/><p>Erin\u2019s light.</p><br/><p>Erin\u2019s glory.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho rose up. He pushed back the magic power of the magician king with the shining Excalibur. He released the glory of Erin and activated the sentence of the Milesian.

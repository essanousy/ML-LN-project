She put more strength in her arms embracing Tae Ho once and then stepped back.</p><br/><p>Valkyrie Hildegarde.</p><br/><p>The one that had brought Tae Ho to Valhalla.</p><br/><p>She had black hair and a blue armor that suited her well. Her cheerfulness, that was a bit different to Reginleif, could be felt in her expression and her small movements.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho breathed in for now. As he calmed down his surprised heart he became rather composed.</p><br/><p>When he first entered Valhalla, he really wanted to meet the Valkyrie that was now in front of him. Where was this place, why had he come to Valhalla, and how was the situation turning? He didn\u2019t want to ask about one or two things.</p><br/><p>But it was now different.</p><br/><p>The questions he had were almost fully answered.</p><br/><p>This place was Valhalla, where the souls of the great warriors gathered at. The warriors of Valhalla were the warriors that protected Asgard and the nine realms from the giants and demons.</p><br/><p>It was a rather strange thing that Tae Ho, that wasn\u2019t from Midgard, got brought here but even so it wasn\u2019t unprecedented.</p><br/><p>And based on the experiences he had accumulated until now, there was almost no probabilities for the Valkyrie in front of him to hold all the answers. Because it wasn\u2019t that she had brought him out of her own will.</p><br/><p>But still, Tae Ho asked her once and heard the answer he had expected.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was also the first time I brought someone from another world.\u201d</p><br/><p>The method the Valkyries gathered souls was simple. They would wait on the battlefield they were designated and if some warriors died over there she would bring the ones she judged as being righteous to enter Valhalla or fitted the requisites, or just left them be.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe thing that decides on which battlefield we have to be at is the Celestial sphere the king of Gods Odin and the Goddess of magic Freya made together.\u201d</p><br/><p>In other words, it meant that it was decided by a machine and wasn\u2019t willed by someone.</p><br/><p>But of course, there may be the possibility for someone to have manipulated the machine, but that was really difficult and unnecessary. There was no one that would benefit from having brought Tae Ho to Valhalla.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, if there was should it be Idun?\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn said and Tae Ho ignored him.</p><br/><p>Hildegarde kept speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways, i\u2019m really glad for us to have met like this. I belong to Freya\u2019s legion.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFreya\u2019s legion?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Goddess of love and beauty Freya.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho had seen warriors from almost all the legions but he had never seen a warrior that belonged to Freya\u2019s legion.</p><br/><p>As Tae Ho put on a surprised face, Siri that was next to him, said in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlmost all of the Valkyries that retrieve the souls of the warriors belong to Odin\u2019s or Freya\u2019s legion.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reason was simple. Odin and Freya were the ones that made Valhalla.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought that you would become an intermediate ranked warrior in a short time. Because you had the quality to do so. Take pride in yourself as you are the first soul I led.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hildegarde laughed as she was really proud of herself and then asked while tilting her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you belong to Idun\u2019s legion?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow marvelous. It has been a really, really long while since a new warrior entered Idun\u2019s legion. It must have been a dozen years\u2026no, the first time since the Great war. I obviously thought that you would enter Odin\u2019s or Freya\u2019s legion.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two things piqued his interest.</p><br/><p>He did know that there were scarce newcomer warriors in Idun\u2019s legion but for him to be the first since the Great War. There was a possibility for Hildegarde to be misinformed but whatever the case, it seemed like it was true that it has been a dozen years.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen the souls don\u2019t have any particular God they served, the promising ones usually go to Odin\u2019s or Freya\u2019s legion. I could have never imagined that you would go to Idun\u2019s legion. I was planning to teach you the path of the warrior myself if you came to Freya\u2019s legion.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Was it really a plot of Idun?\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho ignored Cuchulainn\u2019s words once again and pointed at the empty table.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we sit down?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat would be good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hildegarde laughed and took the lead and Tae Ho followed her back. Bracky and the warriors were looking at Tae Ho, that had attained a place to have alcohol with the Valkyrie, with taciturn eyes and then scattered. And he didn\u2019t know why but Siri followed him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for surveillance.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know for whom or for what it was but Tae Ho didn\u2019t refute for now.</p><br/><p>The time with Hildegarde wasn\u2019t as long as he thought. Hildegarde wanted to listen to things related to Idun\u2019s legion and the world Tae Ho originally used to live but she didn\u2019t have the time to do so. She received a sudden call from Freya\u2019s legion and stood up from her seat after emptying her glass.</p><br/><p>\u201cValkyries at the front lines are always the busiest. I will wait for the day we stand on the same battlefield.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hildegarde smiled brightly and then placed her lips on Tae Ho\u2019s forehead.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet Freya\u2019s blessing accompany you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018One more blessing from a Valkyrie has been added. A smile appears on the face of the Valkyrie collector Tae Ho.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn was saying a lot of nonsense today. Tae Ho also ignored him this time and then expressed etiquette towards Hildegarde by hitting his chest.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know if it was inevitable or a coincidence but Heda returned not too long after Hildegarde left. As the warriors of Valhalla had all scattered and were drinking among themselves, Tae Ho chose to return quickly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will return in a while. See you later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri waved her hand while sitting down and Tae Ho moved to the dock with Heda. He was just looking at Heda\u2019s back, that was preparing the wooden boat like usual, and said casually.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, Heda.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that it has been tens of years since a warrior entered Idun\u2019s legion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda flinched. Tae Ho laughed unconsciously and started to tell her about the meeting he had with Hildegarde. And then Heda pouted her lips and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cI acted a bit calm. It\u2019s embarrassing to act excited.\u201d</p><br/><p>She did bring Tae Ho to Idun\u2019s legion as if nothing had happened but actually Heda was really excited that day. No, she was nervous. She even offered him a cigarette she didn\u2019t even smoke.</p><br/><p>Actually it was something she could only say it now but she was glad that Tae Ho said he wouldn\u2019t smoke it. She did have it in case a new warrior entered but she hadn\u2019t actually used it. There was also the probability of it having turned bad because of how long it was there.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho just looked at Heda refuting back and put on a smile and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that was the case. You were pressing it down. You forced yourself to act calm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda flushed. She looked at Tae Ho with resentful eyes and then pouted again.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I can act a bit tough.\u201d</p><br/><p>In addition, Tae Ho was really bewildered on that day. If Heda was also bewildered then Tae Ho\u2019s uneasiness would have become bigger.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho also knew that truth really well. Because of that he just laughed instead of teasing her.</p><br/><p>\u2018How far you go is always important.\u2019</p><br/><p>While Cuchulainn unexpectedly said some helping words, time flowed fast and they could soon see the residence right in front of them. Adenmaha, that had the shape of a sea serpent, greeted Tae Ho and Heda.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou came?\u201d</p><br/><p>A sea serpent that was just pouting its head on a misty lake was something really scary, but as it was Adenmaha they were talking about they didn\u2019t think of that at all.</p><br/><p>Heda tied up the wooden boat and then said.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo greet Idun-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because the first thing you had to do when you returned to the residence was to greet Idun.</p><br/><p>\u2018She\u2019s sulking. You won\u2019t be able to receive her blessing for quite a while.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho placed Gae Bolg in Unnir to block Cuchulainn\u2019s teasing voice and walked towards the shrine. As soon as he opened the door, a green field spread in front of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy warrior Tae Ho.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was Idun, that was the same as always. As soon as Tae Ho expressed his manners Idun said again.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad that you are healthy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s thanks to your blessing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Idun smiled brightly at Tae Ho\u2019s answer and then extended her hand to raise him up.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy warrior Tae Ho. I have many things I want to show you. Thanks to you, my believers in Midgard increased by a lot. In addition, you should also see this. A shrine was built up.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Idun waved her hand lightly, two circle scenes appeared in the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my shrine. I\u2019m able to see it like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>King Sven and his advisor Ube was seen in the first scene. The two people had built up several shrines of Idun in several places of the island, just like they promised Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>In the second scene they could see Helga praying. It was Idun\u2019s shrine that king Ivar had set up.</p><br/><p>\u201cWarriors holding me in their hearts have increased. Will you listen to their voices?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Idun spoke excitedly, Tae Ho also got as excited as her. As he nodded fervently, Idun laughed and waved her hand again. The voices of the warriors were heard in another scene.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh valiant and beautiful Idun, give me strength and courage.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard the story of Idun\u2019s legion that\u2019s filled with beautiful Valkyries. I also want to go there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI saw the flying pirate ship. For only a part of the treasures that Idun has to be that much. It\u2019s really incredible. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a great army even in Valhalla.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRagnar said that you sold a lot of stuff.\u201d</p><br/><p>The last one was Idun. While Tae Ho cleared his throat another voice was heard again. It was the voice of a woman this time.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to meet Idun\u2019s warrior that came from Valhalla again.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was the princess of Kataron, Helga. She was drawing an image of Tae Ho in her head that has rescued her and her siblings.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, so that\u2019s the case.\u201d</p><br/><p>Idun said with a vague voice. Although he couldn\u2019t see her because of the light, he was sure that her eyes were sharp right now.</p><br/><p>While Tae Ho was still perplexed, Idun waved her hand to erase all the scenes.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is a really amazing achievement to the point I had to think really hard on what reward I should give you. So won\u2019t you wait for a moment? I will soon prepare something suitable for your achievement.\u201d</p><br/><p>How can he say no in this situation? As Tae Ho answered that he would, Idun nodded slowly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have many things to talk about. Although you did have an audience with me I couldn\u2019t talk to you as you were always training. We have to talk about \u2018Idun\u2019s warrior\u2019 that has transformed but I think it would be better to speak to Ragnar and Scathach about that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because it was related to a saga and a geass.</p><br/><p>Idun finished speaking and grabbed on Tae Ho\u2019s hands. It was really warm and soft. It was the same sensation he got when he connected with Idun when he used \u2018Idun\u2019s warrior\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u2026my warrior Tae Ho.\u201d</p><br/><p>Idun paused and said. When Tae Ho looked at her Idun slightly closed the distance between Tae Ho and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou called Heda\u2019s name in the decisive moment this time too.\u201d</p><br/><p>The name Tae Ho called before swinging the Sword of light wasn\u2019t Idun\u2019s but Heda\u2019s name.</p><br/><p>As Tae Ho flinched, Idun let go of Tae Ho\u2019s hands and turned in a circle.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that was the case. You called out Heda\u2019s name even though you were connected with me. That was what happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although she was imitating Heda, it felt like there were blades in her words.</p><br/><p>As Tae Ho struggled without being able to answer anything, Idun giggled as if it was all a joke.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust like I told you before, the most important thing is that you returned safely. So don\u2019t worry too much. But\u2026.call out my name at times too. I\u2019m rather disappointed. Understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>How will he not call her when the Goddess tells him like that? It was weird to say that he would but he decided to answer something first.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will also call Idun-nim\u2019s name from now on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, that\u2019s something a playboy would say.\u201d</p><br/><p>By now, he became certain that she was teasing him.</p><br/><p>Idun giggled this time too and then calmed down her breathing and fixed her expression and looked at Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy warrior Tae Ho. You have done really well. I\u2019m really proud of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were just some words instead of a material reward, but Tae Ho could feel a sense of accomplishment fill his heart.</p><br/><p>Although it wasn\u2019t that the number of warriors increased in Idun\u2019s legion or there was a noticeable change, but he felt rewarded based on his efforts.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet my blessing accompany you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Idun placed her lips on Tae Ho\u2019s forehead.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>The next morning, Tae Ho got greatly satisfied after eating the meal Heda prepared in a really long time. Heda also had a fresh expression as if her sulkiness had all disappeared in a day.</p><br/><p>As Ragnar was outside of the residence as he had some business to take care of, Tae Ho decided to first speak it with Scathach.</p><br/><p>Although he did have Cuchulainn, he had other things to ask aside of the geass.</p><br/><p>Scathach\u2019s body was still asleep, but her consciousness was awake. Because of that, she could send her soul outside of her body and communicate with the people in the residence.</p><br/><p>Compared to Rolo, that didn\u2019t particularly care if his owner returned safely, Adenmaha certainly had a cute side in her. When she heard that Tae Ho would be going to Scathach, she transformed into the shape of a Goddess and followed Tae Ho\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>Scathach\u2019s lodging was a building made of stones that was located in a corner of Idun\u2019s residence. Just looking at it made you think of a shrine and Scathach\u2019s asleep body was inside of that.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe power of Idun nim is strong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha said while passing the entrance of the shrine. It was because of the blessings she had given her several times to protect her. Perhaps, the amount of blessings would be bigger than the number of Idun\u2019s shrines.</p><br/><p>As Adenmaha touched her neck as if it was stifling, Tae Ho grabbed on her hands and activate the \u2018one that controls dragons\u2019 to strengthen her control. Only then did Adenmaha nod as if it was much better.</p><br/><p>Although the difference in their status as Goddesses was clear and Adenmaha was a Goddess of another world, she could only feel a bit of rejection towards the power of Idun but thanks to Tae Ho all of that rejection had disappeared.</p><br/><p>As Tae Ho grabbed on Adenmaha\u2019s hands and entered a deep place, he could see Scathach\u2019s body lying on an altar and next to her, the soul of Scathach that was half transparent.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you came Tae Ho. I was worried because the speed of the classes slowed down.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho flinched unconsciously and Adenmaha burst out of laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s important for the classes to be constant. As you have already started to learn about the power of Tuatha De Danann, you should keep on progressing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Those are right words.\u2019</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t ignore Cuchulainn\u2019s words this time maybe because it really were right words.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho cleared his throat a few times to change the atmosphere and then spoke to Scathach.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, I have some things I want to ask you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s about the power you used, Idun-nim was also greatly worried about you. But looking at how calm Cuchulainn is, it seems like it\u2019s not that big of a problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because the after effects of the geass or the restrictions had disappeared. Cuchulainn recommended talking about the legend ranked saga \u2018Idun\u2019s warrior\u2019 having strengthened and its restriction having disappeared was closer to the boundary of the saga rather than the geass, so they should talk about it when Ragnar returned.</p><br/><p>Because of that Tae Ho said something apart of \u2018Idun\u2019s warrior\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an item I found in Midgard.\u201d</p><br/><p>What Tae Ho took out from Unnir was Liberatus.</p><br/><p>The treasure of the kingdom of Kataron, that held a fragment of Gae Bolg. Cuchulainn guessed that the one that made Liberatus was someone that could handle the power of Erin.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really isn\u2019t an ordinary item. This object was made with the techniques of Erin. It\u2019s the handiwork of someone that\u2019s skilled in the techniques of Tuatha De Danann and also the Milesians. No, it\u2019s not only that. If we are talking about the technique that made this object\u2026\u2026then it seems like it rivals mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no way a human that was born in Midgard possessed those abilities. It was certainly a survivor of Erin.</p><br/><p>\u2018Are you talking that his skills rivals yours, teacher?\u2019</p><br/><p>Scathach nodded as Cuchulainn asked in a surprised voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe reason I was able to make Gae Bolg is because I was the queen of the land of darkness. It won\u2019t be easy even for me to make something like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Scathach was one of the great witches of high status even in Erin. Although her abilities on crafting a weapon was limited, there weren\u2019t many that had skills that were comparable to hers.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnfortunately enough, I can\u2019t check whose work this is from. But fortunately, the one that made this left a clue.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA clue?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. There\u2019s a message magic left in the part of the hilt, that\u2019s not related to the operation of the sword.\u201d</p><br/><p>If it was a message magic, then it was highly probable for it to be a clue. Something like telling them his location or something similar.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho admired and turned to look ad Adenmaha.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I was wondering why you didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>She should also be a Goddess of Tuatha De Danann.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t show it to me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho understood and turned to look at Scathach again, and she looked at Adenmaha that had inflated her cheeks and laughed. She then extended her hand towards Liberatus.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will activate it then.\u201d</p><br/><p>The magic of Tuatha De Danann.</p><br/><p>A stream of light appeared from Liberatus and the message magic got activated.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 25 \u2013 Paul\u2019s sword (1) &gt; End</p><hr/><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The monsters of Artemis that were watching the centaurs charge from above the walls, had to experience a great shock and fear.</p><br/><p>A strong magic, divine punishment.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that a strength like this didn\u2019t exist in Olympus, but it wasn\u2019t common to witness something that powerful.</p><br/><p>Their opponents weren\u2019t the 12 Olympians nor the great heroes that were favored by the Gods.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why they couldn\u2019t imagine a result like this. In addition, if there had been a more thorough and mystical preparation they wouldn\u2019t be as shocked.</p><br/><p>It was a frontal roll.</p><br/><p>When a frail woman curled down and rolled forward a few times, the centaur cavalry ended up massacred.</p><br/><p>The woman was still rolling. She rolled about five or six times and then fell to a side and couldn\u2019t stand up properly after that.</p><br/><p>Gather the forces. They can\u2019t let them pass the walls. Prepare the arrows. Eliminate the enemies with ranged attacks that would cover the sky.</p><br/><p>The red skinned satyrs yelled. Their order as the ones who had received the commanding rights over the monsters gathered in Delphos were transmitted quickly.</p><br/><p>The monsters that were resting inside the forest climbed up the walls.</p><br/><p>The forces that were spread widely on all the walls of Delphos gathered in the walls and gates that were facing Tae Ho\u2019s group.</p><br/><p>Looking at thousands of monsters of different races moving busily was a grand spectacle by itself.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho watcheded the movements of the monsters with his \u2018eyes of the dragon\u2019 that he strengthened with Bragi\u2019s rune. It was hard to read their races or names as there were just too many of them, but what he needed was only the general movement in the first place.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s flowing as I expected.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn said. There was no way Tae Ho\u2019s expectations in these regards would go wrong.</p><br/><p>If Nidhogg destroyed their advance troops they would gather their forces and take solid defenses in the wall instead of coming out.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho hadn\u2019t explained what he would do next to the group.</p><br/><p>But they vaguely knew what he was about to do as they had been in several battlefields with him. That was excluding Patroclus and Sybilla who were from Olympus and Apollo that was looking through Sybilla.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg tried to stand up but fell on her butt and Adenmaha tried to raise her up. But Nidhogg shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. I can still roll. I have 5 more times to roll.\u201d</p><br/><p>She had told Tae Ho that she could roll more than ten times and she had only rolled 5 times.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha smiled bitterly at Nidhogg\u2019s devoted answer. Every second was important right now but she said softly instead of raising her voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know. But it\u2019s now time to move to the next stage.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg reacted at the word \u2018next\u2019. She didn\u2019t resist at Adenmaha\u2019s hands and stood up.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should leave this place! Their attack will start now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Patroclus got a hold of himself and yelled. It was because he saw the forces gathering on the walls without the need of using the \u2018eye of the dragon\u2019.</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t only planning on firing arrows. You could see that they were preparing huge boulders and fireballs to throw. And there were a lot of them.</p><br/><p>But the Valkyries didn\u2019t escape. Siri and Bracky stood in their places firmly and glared at the fortress and that was no different for Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>[Apollo is doubtful.]</p><br/><p>[He asks why she isn\u2019t rolling anymore.]</p><br/><p>Nidhogg\u2019s frontal role was certainly a strong tactical weapon. It was perfect for trampling down the enemies charging towards them as the earth shook every time she rolled.</p><br/><p>But it was only to that extent. It was impossible to destroy the walls. And it was also impossible to block the attacks that would start pouring down.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha patted Nidhogg\u2019s back and she wore her helmet firmly as it had scattered.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReady.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg nodded with a face filled with resolution. Adenmaha grabbed her shoulder once tightly and looked at Tae Ho. Tae Ho nodded when he sensed her gaze.</p><br/><p>\u201cIncoming!\u201d</p><br/><p>Patroclus yelled once again.</p><br/><p>Apollo tried to release the few divine power he could through Sybilla.</p><br/><p>The rain of arrows covered the sky. It dyed the sky in black.</p><br/><p>Huge boulders flew in between the arrows. They would get crushed by it anytime soon if they didn\u2019t dodge.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho clenched his fists and activated his saga while advancing forward instead of retreating!</p><br/><p>[Saga: The warrior that had a Goddess meet him]</p><br/><p>[Fake Nidhogg]</p><br/><p>Something pitch black surged up in front of Tae Ho and it, that was like a huge wall, blocked every attack</p><br/><p>The rain of arrows scattered in an instant. The huge rock in front of them wasn\u2019t a rock anymore.</p><br/><p>A huge body reaching a hundred meters.</p><br/><p>A black dragon.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho didn\u2019t control the fake Nidhogg and didn\u2019t give it any commands.</p><br/><p>The essence of the real Nidhogg entered the fake Nidhogg.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg left Adenmaha\u2019s side the moment the pitch black figure surged up and then entered the heart room and thought while receiving the attacks. She glared at the high and thick walls of Delphos and remembered the training in the residence.</p><br/><p>\u201cFind what you can do well and concentrate. Then, whatever that is, it will become your weapon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are able to do it. If you can\u2019t trust in yourself believe in your real body that knows you can do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Scathach said harshly.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg stroke her head and said refreshingly.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg curled down and took a rolling posture.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will roll.\u201d</p><br/><p>She said consciously and thought.</p><br/><p>The most ideal form of rolling.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg\u2019s body, the black dragon, wasn\u2019t a living being. You could say it was a kind of magic armor.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why she could change it however she wished. It could materialize based on Nidhogg\u2019s wishes.</p><br/><p>The black dragon curled down. It lowered its head and buried it in its knees and then covered its body with its spread wings.</p><br/><p>The scales moved. The huge body of the black dragon took on the body of an armadillo.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m- Rolling!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg rolled inside the heart room and at that moment the black dragon spun in place. It then charged towards the walls!</p><br/><p>[Saga: Rolling disaster]</p><br/><p>A catastrophe of a different scale to when Nidhogg\u2019s essence rolled alone occurred.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s body was about a hundred meters. A heavy and huge heavy weapon, that reached dozens of meters even when curling, attacked the walls of Delphos. It destroyed the walls as easily as a bowling ball striking pins!</p><br/><p>Kwagagagang!</p><br/><p>Kurururung!</p><br/><p>The walls couldn\u2019t endure it. The first wall was destroyed ruthlessly and then the second and third walls also fell.</p><br/><p>The ground split up. The shock shook up the broken walls and inflicted additional destruction.</p><br/><p>But the walls weren\u2019t the only thing to be destroyed.</p><br/><p>The monsters that were gathered in the walls.</p><br/><p>The reason Tae Ho didn\u2019t attack with the fake dragon from the start was because of this. It was to inflict the most damage he could in only one attack.</p><br/><p>The destruction of the walls of Delphos, that were said to be impregnable, took away the rationality of the monsters. No, it didn\u2019t only end at that. It planted within them an overwhelming fear.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho charged forward. He ran towards the black dragon that didn\u2019t just destroy the walls but also crushed down everything horizontally.</p><br/><p>The black dragon was disappearing. It had a limit as it wasn\u2019t the real body but a fake one. The roll Nidhogg showed this time was a technique that possessed a power that was different to the one she showed in the battlefield of Asgard. So naturally, the strength it expended was also strong.</p><br/><p>\u2018Over there!\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn yelled. Tae Ho, who kicked the air in consecution, grabbed Nidhogg mid fall while she complained about the dizziness.</p><br/><p>Right at that moment, an admiration that wasn\u2019t an admiration was heard one beat late.</p><br/><p>[Apollo is greatly bewildered.]</p><br/><p>[Apollo is roaring.]</p><br/><p>[My city!]</p><br/><p>Whatever the case, Delphos was his most treasured city.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho smiled bitterly. He pulled Nidhogg more tightly and yelled once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cAdenmaha! Rolo!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Saga: Master of flames]</p><br/><p>[Saga: Master of frost]</p><br/><p>The Red dragon Shootingstar and the Frost dragon Javier surged up from Tae Ho\u2019s sides. They were small compared to the black dragon but they were still monsters that reached thirty meters long from head to tail.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha and Rolo knew well what they had to do. They didn\u2019t turn to look back at Tae Ho pointlessly and opened their mouths towards the monsters. They gave them a baptism of ice and flames.</p><br/><p>It was an overwhelming scene. Even the monsters that the range of the breath didn\u2019t reach them couldn\u2019t scream. They just got buried at the scene in front of them.</p><br/><p>And that was the same for Patroclus.</p><br/><p>He trembled at the grand appearance of the red and white dragons followed by the black dragon. He let out a dumbfounded voice unconsciously.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is that guy? No, person\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Patroclus was someone that served Athena and that\u2019s why he instinctively considered his nature.</p><br/><p>The appearance of the three dragons was certainly shocking. In addition, what they had performed in an instant was so overwhelming it could be treated as a divine punishment.</p><br/><p>But the important thing wasn\u2019t the three dragons, it was the man controlling them. Just like how the person wielding a sword was more important than the sword itself.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun\u2019s warrior.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun\u2019s commander.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rasgrid and Ingrid said. Gandur laughed refreshingly and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cAsgard\u2019s saviour.\u201d</p><br/><p>he wasn\u2019t a simple individual.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to say that he was already an army by himself. A mere army of monsters that only had numbers couldn\u2019t stop Idun\u2019s warrior. It was a fact that had already been proved several times in Asgard.</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard!\u201d</p><br/><p>Someone yelled at that time.</p><br/><p>That person still hadn\u2019t fallen in fear even though two dragons were firing out ice and flames. He concentrated on the one that made this situation just like Patroclus did.</p><br/><p>The master of the javelin, Meleager.</p><br/><p>He, the lover of Atalante who claimed speed rivaling that of Achilles, was also a hero of Artemis.</p><br/><p>The moment the walls fell down, he unleashed his agility suitable of a hero and glared at Tae Ho who continued embracing Nidhogg while landing.</p><br/><p>\u201cDie! Freya\u2019s warrior! This is the real spear of divine punishment!\u201d</p><br/><p>An incredible strength was released in the spear Meleager clenched.</p><br/><p>The curse of the Goddess of moon and hunt Artemis.</p><br/><p>There were several cursed arrows winding down the spear.</p><br/><p>It was dangerous. Cuchulainn warned him that. Tae Ho grabbed Nidhogg only with one hand and pulled out Arondight. Siri hurriedly nocked an arrow to hit the flying spear and Bracky took on a stance to throw his hammer.</p><br/><p>Meleager threw his spear. It was a perfect movement as expected of a master of the javelin.</p><br/><p>His spear shone in silver. The divine power of Artemis gave a greater strength to the already strong spear of Meleager.</p><br/><p>Siri fired her arrow and Bracky threw his hammer.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho saw the trajectory of the spear with his \u2018eyes of the dragon\u2019.</p><br/><p>Kwagang!</p><br/><p>The spear pierced the air loudly. The arrow and hammer didn\u2019t hit it. Tae Ho was bewildered for a moment as he was following the trajectory.</p><br/><p>The spear flew to another place. It was the direction the connecting path was at.</p><br/><p>The one that was the most bewildered was Meleager and he then understood. He glared at Tae Ho and yelled.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me! Did you fake the God you are serving?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The warrior of the most beautiful Goddess.</p><br/><p>The warrior of Freya wasn\u2019t in this place. Idun\u2019s warrior Tae Ho was outside of the curse of Artemis.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn understood the situation and that\u2019s why he said in a loud voice instead of laughing.</p><br/><p>\u2018Scary bastard. Was it all a preparation for this?\u2019</p><br/><p>That obviously wasn\u2019t the case. Cuchulainn also knew that. But he still spoke like that and Tae Ho charged forward instead of rebuking his words. He let go of Nidhogg and threw Arondight towards Meleager with both of his hands.</p><br/><p>It was to buy time.</p><br/><p>Meleager cursed out and hurriedly raised his reserve spear. Meleager managed to parry it but Tae Ho had already arrived in front of him by then.</p><br/><p>\u201cCowardly bastard!\u201d</p><br/><p>For a warrior to lie about the God he served. To betray his God!</p><br/><p>Tae Ho yelled that he never did that inwardly. Instead of parrying the piercing attack of Meleager, he just rode on it. The spear slipped off in the blades of the Swing sword and Tae Ho entered his range naturally.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho punched Meleager\u2019s side with his left hand instead of doing something with his sword. It was a kind of shockwave fired in close range.</p><br/><p>Meleager surged up vertically. Tae Ho let go of his Swing sword without regrets and inflicted an additional blow with his right hand that had become free. He threw a punch at his chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meleager vomited blood and Tae Ho grabbed new weapons in both of his hands. They were Caliburn and Gallatin.</p><br/><p>Kalsted\u2019s style techniques.</p><br/><p>Lightning flash.</p><br/><p>It was a technique that had also worked on the Magician King. It wasn\u2019t an attack Meleager could block as he still hadn\u2019t been able to overcome the consecutive shock.</p><br/><p>The two swords drew a beautiful trajectory and shone. Meleager, that got his limbs in addition to his chest, couldn\u2019t resist and collapsed. Tae Ho granted the last attack in his chest.</p><br/><p>Meleager vomited black blood and died. Tae Ho retrieved Caliburn and Gallatin and grabbed Arondight from the ground.</p><br/><p>[Apollo is impressed at your martial arts.]</p><br/><p>[Apollo is jealous of your Goddess.]</p><br/><p>[Apollo warns you.]</p><br/><p>[Apollo tells you to look at the shrine immediately.]</p><br/><p>The voices of the Gods that were ringing in his head changed. Tae Ho looked at the shrine of Delphos that was located at the center of the city.</p><br/><p>The ground was shaking. This commotion was generated by the one eyed giants, the cyclops, that were hiding near the shrines standing up.</p><br/><p>Patroclus gulped dry saliva as he looked from a distant place. It was an obvious reaction as there were five giants that were more than two meters tall.</p><br/><p>The monsters that were despairing in the broken walls found their courage back. There were even some that yelled.</p><br/><p>Sybilla trembled in fear and prayed to Apollo.</p><br/><p>Apollo wanted to ask if he couldn\u2019t call the black dragon once again.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho took a deep breath. He left the monsters on the walls to Adenmaha and Rolo. He called back Nidhogg and told the Valkyries to protect her.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho was calm and it was the same for the Valkyries.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly now have the monsters we specialize in come out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t drop your guards because you are accustomed to them. It\u2019s the first time facing a giant of Olympus.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bracky and Siri said. They have had bloody battles against giants and also giant kings in the war of Asgard.</p><br/><p>The warriors of Asgard.</p><br/><p>The warriors of the Gods that fought against the old enemies of Asgard, the giants of Jotunheim.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho advanced towards the shrine of Delphos along with Bracky and Siri.</p><br/><p>And at midday on that day.</p><br/><p>The city of Delphos became Apollo\u2019s once again.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 50 \u2013 God of Sun (3) &gt; End</p><hr/><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/><p>Episode 50/Chapter 4: God of Sun (4)</p><br/><p>TL: Tsubak</p><br/><p>ED: SlowAsLightning</p><hr/><br/><p>Patroclus looked at the fortress with a dumbfounded expression.</p><br/><p>The shrine of Delphos was right across the walls so you could see the results of the fight more clearly from here than anywhere else.</p><br/><p>The impregnable fortress that made you feel astounded just by watching it didn\u2019t exist anymore.</p><br/><p>Although three sides of the walls were still intact, the south gate that could be called the main gate of Delphos was completely destroyed. Being able to see the horizon that was usually covered by the walls was a really refreshing sight.</p><br/><p>And there was nothing safe in between the broken walls and the shrine. It was obvious as five cyclops had run wild.</p><br/><p>Patroclus gulped dry saliva and moved his head to the sides. He looked at the Cyclops that were collapsed everywhere.</p><br/><p>Thunderbolt.</p><br/><p>He had seen the fight with his eyes but the only thing that remained in his head was the thunder.</p><br/><p>The big man that was with Idun\u2019s warrior wasn\u2019t only someone big.</p><br/><p>Looking at him massacring the giants with his hammer and lightning made him look like the God of thunder Thor. No, it wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to say he looked just like Thor.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the best compliment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bracky laughed and said but even his laughter sounded like thunder.</p><br/><p>The battle of the female warrior, that used a bow as her main weapon, was silent compared to the big man. She repeated leaping and sprinting that was close to flying and inflicting fatal damage to the cyclops.</p><br/><p>If the giant man was Thor, then the woman that possessed a marvelous bowmanship resembled the Goddess of hunt Artemis.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an excessive compliment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri gave out a hard answer compared to Bracky but it seemed like she was embarrassed rather than feeling bad looking at her wolf ears twitch. If you saw closely, you could see that her tail was also wagging slightly.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s also surprising that the two of them are lovers.\u2019</p><br/><p>Because it seemed like Bracky\u2019s arm was thicker than Siri\u2019s waist. It was a really big difference in size.</p><br/><p>\u2018But of course, there would inevitably be a size difference no matter who stood next to Bracky.\u2019</p><br/><p>Patroclus looked at Siri and Bracky standing side to side and looked at reality once again.</p><br/><p>The more than ten thousand monsters that had gathered in Delphos didn\u2019t exist anymore.</p><br/><p>Actually, only twenty to thirty percent of the monsters died in battle. Of course, that was still a big number but whatever the case thousands of monsters were still alive.</p><br/><p>But they had lost their will to fight. No, they couldn\u2019t have even grasp how many of them were left. They were only focused on escaping.</p><br/><p>Patroclus empathized with them. The scene of a huge dragon breaking down the walls with rolling and the giants getting massacred was a wonder to Patroclus. So how would the monsters feel experiencing it directly?</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you okay? You don\u2019t look well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Patroclus was surprised at the voice he heard and looked at his side. Gandur was standing next to him.</p><br/><p>She also served Ullr just like Siri and but her actions and way of speaking were really bright compared to the comparatively calm Rasgrid and Ingrid, and she boasted of her stealthy movements as expected of a Valkyrie of a God of hunting.</p><br/><p>He had been thinking of another thing but Patroclus hadn\u2019t been able to notice her presence until she arrived next to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Patroclus answered reflexively and turned to look at Gandur. It was because he had something he wanted to ask.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm\u2026.Are they especially strong even among warriors of Valhalla?\u201d</p><br/><p>His question was too direct maybe because his feelings got ahead but it was also that clear of a question.</p><br/><p>Gandur snickered and shrugged her shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe three of them are a bit special. Not all the warriors of Valhalla are like that and Idun\u2019s warrior especially is a little more special.\u201d</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t saying this only because they were top and superior ranked warriors.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t only Tae Ho but Siri and Bracky also had many sides on them that differentiated them from the other superior ranked warriors.</p><br/><p>\u2018Be it an abnormal growth rate.\u2019</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t only about the exceptional case that was Tae Ho and Bracky, the best warrior of Midgard and a genius even in Valhalla.</p><br/><p>Siri\u2019s growth rate was also abnormal, only that the two mentioned before were too monstrous.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt sounds weird but I feel a bit relieved.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gandur giggled as Patroclus smiled and said bitterly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis sounds really weird but I do understand you when you speak like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because a world that had beings above the standard was beyond imagination. If the ones that seemed special were really special, then he would be able to somehow accept it as it was inside the range of imagination.</p><br/><p>Gandur snickered once again and then turned around lightly and looked at the shrine of Delphos. It looked similar to the small shrine but the difference in size was overwhelming. If the small shrine was a house, then this one was a palace.</p><br/><p>\u201cWill it take long?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gandur was looking below the shrine. It was because the place Tae Ho took Sybilla was the secret sanctum that was located underground. below the shrine of Delphos.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t take that long. It\u2019s just a guess but\u2026at most they will finish at dinner.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a process to drive away the divine power of Artemis and recover the sanctum. It may have taken longer if it was a different place but this was Delphos. It was a land that had a strong power even among the sanctums of APollo. It would react to Apollo\u2019s divine power immediately.</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed. Let\u2019s prepare the food then. You will help, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gandur pointed at the entrance of the shrine with her chin. They saw Adenmaha and Nidhogg litting up a fire outside the shrine.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a normal thing to prepare a meal for a group more than ten people.</p><br/><p>Patroclus was thinking of compensating what he couldn\u2019t do in the battle with whatever else he could do.</p><br/><p>\u201cI like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gandur smirked and crossed her arm over his shoulder naturally. It was a really rude action in Olympus but it didn\u2019t seem to be the case looking at Gandur\u2019s expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cI also like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? What did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hurry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Patroclus got out of Gandur\u2019s arm and hastened his steps and Gandur snickered. She shrugged her shoulders once and joined the preparations for dinner.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>Nidhogg grabbed the food she was preparing stealthily and Adenmaha slapped the back of her hand in response.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho, who was standing on the secred underground, looked at a distant place.</p><br/><p>The secret sanctum, which was located in the middle of a big underground lake, didn\u2019t give the feeling that it was under the ground because the ceiling was high and it was bright.</p><br/><p>There was a roofless shrine in the middle of the sanctum, which took the shape of a small island, and Apollo\u2019s statue was once again in the middle.</p><br/><p>Sybilla prayed and had a ritual while kneeling in front of the statue of Apollo and the lights inside the sanctum started to move and gathered in the statue.</p><br/><p>They would return Delphos, that had fallen in the hands of Artemis, to Apollo. And then recover Apollo\u2019s strength.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn\u2019s voice rang inside of Tae Ho\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hey, i\u2019m curious about something.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018What is it?\u2019</p><br/><p>He was bored fortunately. Cuchulainn asked quickly as Tae Ho reacted quickly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why didn\u2019t you do that today? You know, the golden apple tree. You liked that a lot.\u2019</p><br/><p>Because Tae Ho always created an illusion of a golden apple tree after a huge scaled battle. Actually, you could even say that it was Tae Ho\u2019s ceremony.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho flinched when he heard that he really liked it but he didn\u2019t deny his words. He just gave his answer.</p><br/><p>\u2018No one will see it anyways. It\u2019s only a nest of monsters.\u2019</p><br/><p>He was also thinking of hiding the fact that he was a warrior of Idun but he would still get discovered one day. That\u2019s why the reply he gave was closer to the answer.</p><br/><p>\u2018So the Valkyries, Bracky and Siri aren\u2019t people?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018They aren\u2019t targets for the propaganda.\u2019</p><br/><p>They already had Gods they served and didn\u2019t have any intention to converse.</p><br/><p>\u2018Now that I see I\u2019m curious of one thing. What will happen if the people of Olympus believe in Idun-nim? Will it be of help to her? I will have to test it later.\u2019</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t seem like Idun\u2019s strength would be strengthened directly because the number of believers in another world increased, but he still had to try it to know. And even if the divine power itself wasn\u2019t that important, it would still be useful if Idun\u2019s influence got bigger in Olympus.</p><br/><p>\u2018Scary bastard. Speak honestly. You weren\u2019t a pro gamer or whatever in your original world but a missionary, right?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Idun\u2019s heaven and hell of disbelief. Let\u2019s go together. We will yell Idun\u2019s name in the middle of Olympus.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn shook his head at the catchy slogan.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hey, if you marry with Idun-nim I will have to serve the wife of my brother in law.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Mm, so are you saying you can\u2019t do it?\u2019</p><br/><p>No matter the case, it didn\u2019t change the fact that Idun was a Goddess.</p><br/><p>\u2018Anyways, you are already establishing the fact that you will marry with Idun-nim as being true. I already realized it when you said Idun, Heda, Idun, Heda saying that it was for the peace of the family.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho also didn\u2019t refute back. He just thought of Heda\u2019s and Idun\u2019s face instead of continuing to joke with him. He felt good automatically but felt that a corner of his heart got heavy.</p><br/><p>\u2018The two of them\u2026.should be fine, right?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018They will be fine. Asgard itself is safe for now.\u2019</p><br/><p>The Magician King and the World Wolf didn\u2019t exist anymore. They had also driven away almost all of the giants that had infiltrated Asgard so Idun and Heda won\u2019t be in danger in Valhalla.</p><br/><p>[The shrine of Delphos got purified with the divine power of Apollo.]</p><br/><p>[Apollo has regained part of his strength.]</p><br/><p>[Apollo is really happy.]</p><br/><p>The voices were heard in consecution. It seemed like the ceremony had ended.</p><br/><p>[You have completed the quest.]</p><br/><p>[Your reputation has increased.]</p><br/><p>[You got closer to the title \u2018hero killer\u2019.]</p><br/><p>[Apollo\u2019s blessing stays in you.]</p><br/><p>[Apollo is preparing a weapon of the Sun God to give you.]</p><br/><p>The rewards of the quest.</p><br/><p>It was a bit different to when he rescued the small shrine.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho turned to look at himself. The divine power of Apollo entered him just like the voice of the God had said. This situation wasn\u2019t that unfamiliar for him as it wasn\u2019t the first time he obtained a blessing of another God aside of Idun.</p><br/><p>But the unfamiliar thing occurred after that.</p><br/><p>He had absorbed Apollo\u2019s divine power.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that the divinity of Idun that accompanied Tae Ho ate away Apollo\u2019s divine power. He ate Apollo\u2019s divine power to grow his strength and was another divinity that belonged to him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tae Ho?\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn called for him urgently but Tae Ho couldn\u2019t answer. He concentrated on the divinity that was deep inside his soul and took his mind unconsciously.</p><br/><p>And a few seconds later.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn came with his own conclusion when the time Tae Ho felt like it was too long passed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Your divinity has gotten stronger. It got stimulated by Apollo\u2019s divine power\u2026\u2026no, did the reward of the quest become the growth of your divine power? You could also say that he has absorbed the divine power itself.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn was a demigod only that he didn\u2019t particularly show off. He wasn\u2019t someone that would miss the changes that occurred in Tae Ho\u2019s divinity, although it was really faint, as it happened next to him.</p><br/><p>The growth of his divine power through quests.</p><br/><p>It was a really exceptional case. No, it was doubtful if there were even cases like this before.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho was the first warrior that was a God of Asgard and carried out the quest of Olympus.</p><br/><p>\u2018It turned out well anyways. Your divine power will get stronger if you finish quests. It\u2019s a clear structure. Let\u2019s finish them all and become a proper God.\u2019</p><br/><p>Perhaps he would obtain a deity, that was the characteristic of a top ranked warrior, in Olympus and not Asgard.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho closed his eyes and focused on his divinity. Tae Ho felt the thing getting along well with Idun\u2019s divine power. He felt like a divinity of himself in the middle of Idun\u2019s divine power got created.</p><br/><p>\u2018What will my deity become?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Is there something else besides \u2018God of cheating\u2019 for you? Kya, I was the one that thought about it but it really suits you.\u2019</p><br/><p>You couldn\u2019t discern how much was a joke from him.</p><br/><p>[Apollo wants to speak with you.]</p><br/><p>[Apollo is going to send a divine message through Sybilla.]</p><br/><p>The voice of the God was heard at a suitable moment. Tae Ho also wanted a conversation with Apollo.</p><br/><p>But it was when he was about to approach Sybilla.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho stopped his feet and placed his hand on his chest.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why? Are you hurt anywhere?\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho shook his head at Cuchulainn\u2019s question. It wasn\u2019t pain but something else. A moment\u2019s feeling he felt deep in his heart in his divinity that was hard to explain.</p><br/><p>\u2018No, let\u2019s hurry.\u2019</p><br/><p>It would be meaningless if he kept thinking about it. Tae Ho cut all his thoughts and brought himself back to reality.</p><br/><p>He approached Sybilla who was preparing the divine message.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 50 \u2013 God of Sun (4) &gt; End</p><br/>\n</div>"}

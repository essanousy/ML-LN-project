Even just thinking about dodging was impossible.</p><br/><p>The sky itself was crumbling so where could you escape?</p><br/><p>Nidhogg looked like a black meteor as she started to descend curled up while spinning. She first clashed with Jormungand, the space snake, who was hovering in midair.</p><br/><p>A loud sound exploded at the collision but Nidhogg continued to spin. Jormungand, the 1km long space snake, was pushed back and Nidhogg rushed towards Tiamat who was standing with an absent minded expression.</p><br/><p>Tiamat couldn\u2019t evade Nidhogg either. He was blown back by Nidhogg who was much much larger despite curling into a ball.</p><br/><p>Tiamat collapsed. Jormungand twisted its body after smashing into the ground and Nidhogg shook the entire battlefield when she landed. Almost everyone collapsed from the impact.</p><br/><p>[\u201cI\u2019m-Rolling!\u201d]</p><br/><p>But this was merely the beginning. Nidhogg started to spin in place. Her movement was like a fixed wheel and the earth groaned below her. A circle with a radius of a few kilometers formed with Nidhogg in its center and an invisible force pressed down on everyone nearby.</p><br/><p>But this wasn\u2019t an intentional attack. It was merely an aftershock created by the movements to prepare for the next attack.</p><br/><p>Everyone watched Nidhogg spin. They witnessed the spinning disaster changing into a rolling disaster while the sky and ground shuddered under its power.</p><br/><p>[\u201cI\u2019m-going!\u201d]</p><br/><p>Nidhogg yelled the moment the speed of her spin reached a critical point, and the rolling disaster charged at the same time. It struck Tiamat once again who had barely managed to stand up.</p><br/><p>The overwhelming explosion silenced its surroundings. For a moment, everyone on the battlefield was deafened. Everyone watched an unrealistic scene of a 600 meters long monster sent flying away and gulped.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>After flying hundred of meters, Tiamat crashed into the ground, and sound returned to the world. The mother of chaos, the ancient God of Dilmun, roared with rage instead of shock and fear.</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaa-!\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u201cShut up!\u201d]</p><br/><p>Nidhogg suppressed the mother of chaos\u2019 roar with an even louder voice. She adjusted instantly, turned and swung her tail. An enormous tail that equaled the length of Tiamat\u2019s body sped across the ground, and collided with the upper body of Tiamat.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuagh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tiamat\u2019s screamed like a woman. But Nidhogg still didn\u2019t stop even for a moment. She spread her wings and accumulated poison in her mouth. She then fired a green breath towards Tiamat who was desperately trying to stand.</p><br/><p>Fwooosh-!</p><br/><p>A streak of light impacted Tiamat. Tiamat, who had barely stood up, collapsed again and a vicious poison ate away at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cKyak!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jormungand charged forward at that moment. It flew towards Nidhogg like a snake charging towards its prey.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg easily saw the attack. She stopped breathing and moved her hand roughly. She then grabbed the neck of Jormungand, swung it like a whip and threw it against the ground.</p><br/><p>The ground shook once again and the forces of Dilmun and Xindu that were waiting at the rear were about to be crushed by the three monsters.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is it! It\u2019s great. right?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHraesvelgr grandpa is great! You fight well!\u201d</p><br/><p>Inside the heart room of Nidhogg, the black holy dragon.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelgr glared at those front of him while being bound tightly by tentacles from the ground, and Nidhogg cheered while sitting a bit further away from him.</p><br/><p>It was like this. The one controlling the body of the holy dragon wasn\u2019t only Nidhogg. Hraesvelgr was currently here to complement Nidhogg, who was notorious for her awful fighting.</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you go!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hraesvelgr yelled once again and moved the black holy dragon. He fired a breath towards Jormungand who was pretending to be hurt, but was waiting for an opportunity, and Jormungand rolled hurriedly to that attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cFly! Nidhogg!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! Grandpa!\u201d</p><br/><p>The black dragon spread its wings and ascended vertically. It then rolled its body once in the air and charged towards Tiamat.</p><br/><p>\u201cKaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tiamat activated her authority while glaring at Nidhogg as Nidhogg wouldn\u2019t just let her have her way. An invisible force stopped Nidhogg\u2019s advance.</p><br/><p>But it was a meaningless. The invisible wall shattered like glass. Nidhogg accelerated even more and struck Tiamat again.</p><br/><p>Tiamat painfully screamed. Jormungand raised its head and fired poison, and Nidhogg raised her wing to block the lump of poison that flew like a projectile.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg\u2019s body was about 2 kilometers long.</p><br/><p>Even though Jormungand had a body that was 1 kilometer long and hundreds of meters tall, it still had the appearance of a snake. It wasn\u2019t at a level which it could face against Nidhogg with its size.</p><br/><p>The same went for Tiamat. Just looking at the body sizes, Nidhogg was three times larger. The difference in size between the two was like comparing a child and an adult.</p><br/><p>Because of the size discrepancy, Hraesvelgr decided to fight hand to hand and not with authorities.</p><br/><p>As he was connected by fate with Nidhogg, he knew the moment he saw Tiamat.</p><br/><p>Tiamat was like Nidhogg. She was an ancient dragon who also possessed the power of an ancient God.</p><br/><p>No, perhaps Tiamat was even a little stronger.</p><br/><p>This was because Tiamat was the first child born from the chaos of Dilmun, not like Nidhogg who was born from the ancient God of Asgard, Audhumla. Just looking at the status as an ancient God, Tiamat was a level above Nidhogg.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why Nidhogg\u2019s current superior position could disappear instantly if they battled with authorities.</p><br/><p>When Hraesvelgr instinctively realized this fact, he decided to push Tiamat without rest, so that she wouldn\u2019t be able to think of battling with her authority.</p><br/><p>But Tiamat wasn\u2019t that easy to deal. She gave up on fighting hand to hand as she absorbed the power of her long enemy Marduk after the long battle in Dilmun. And instead, she started to release a power of destruction as an ancient God.</p><br/><p>Her power was like a curse. Tiamat released the power of destruction and death spread across the sky and ground. The forces of Dilmun and Xindu who had managed to preserve their lives in the middle of the chaos groaned as they died painfully.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg spread her wings hurriedly and raised a wall of authority to block Tiamat\u2019s destruction from spreading to the Golden palace.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Jormungand attacked. It fired consecutive breaths towards the Nidhogg\u2019s head whose movements were temporarily stalled.</p><br/><p>Tiamat didn\u2019t stay still either. She rose up and released an even stronger power of destruction.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg closed her eyes tightly. She endured breathing in the Jormungand\u2019s poison and strengthened her power of protection. She stopped the destruction of Tiamat from reaching her.</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hraesvelgr shouted. Nidhogg opened her eyes in the middle of the poison and glared at Tiamat.</p><br/><p>Tiamat was smiling. The ancient God of Dilmun didn\u2019t stop at releasing her authority but also called her children. She amplified her own strength through her direct descendants.</p><br/><p>The Commander and the Reaper.</p><br/><p>They, who were confronting the godly existences of the Temple, roared at the same time. The time on the battlefield that had stopped for a moment because of the battle against the three monsters started to flow again.</p><br/><p>The power of Tiamat continued to escalate. It seemed that Jormungand\u2019s power also increased as it spread its black wings of light and flew up to the sky.</p><br/><p>They would reverse the situation.</p><br/><p>Overturn the one sided battle and push them back.</p><br/><p>This was Tiamat\u2019s and Jormungand\u2019s thoughts. But Nidhogg and Tae Ho, who was behind her, weren\u2019t planning on allowing that. He placed his hand on Nidhogg\u2019s shoulder and released his strength. He had never expected that he would encounter Tiamat here, but he had a method to face her.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho had already fought against Nyx, the ancient God of Night of Olympus. He had prepared for a moment like this the moment he marked Dilmun, Xindu, Memphis and Maya as his enemy.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg smiled brightly the moment he spoke. She closed her eyes, curled up and gathered strength.</p><br/><p>The black dragon spread its wings. The black and huge body shone with pure white light and then four lights spread to the sides.</p><br/><p>To the north, south, east and west.</p><br/><p>Tiamat, who had closed her eyes by reflex, now saw Nidhogg covered by a holy light.</p><br/><p>The size of the holy dragon had shrunk almost to a half.</p><br/><p>Tiamat realized the reason for this. She rolled her eyes, hurriedly checked her surroundings and saw the huge and black pillars that surged up with Nidhogg at the center.</p><br/><p>The body of the black holy dragon was a kind of magical armor. Because of that, she was able to change it to a completely different shape.</p><br/><p>Four pillars.</p><br/><p>These pillars acted similarly to the 11 monsters. It served as a catalyst that amplified Nidhogg\u2019s power.</p><br/><p>But Tae Ho wasn\u2019t satisfied just with that.</p><br/><p>As the master of Asgard Tae ho knew. This land was the Temple and because of that, neither Nidhogg, the ancient God of Asgard, nor Tiamat, the ancient God of Dilmun, could release all of their power.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why he would change the location of the battle.</p><br/><p>To a place that Nidhogg could release all her strength!</p><br/><p>[Myth ranked saga]</p><br/><p>[Hall of Valhalla]</p><br/><p>Tae Ho activated his saga. It wasn\u2019t his power alone. It was through Nidhogg. The real role of the four pillars wasn\u2019t to strengthen Nidhogg but to make Asgard descend on this place. He would conquer the land of this foreign world as Asgard\u2019s!</p><br/><p>The four pillars released light to each other. They split the region and the sky and land inside was filled with the power of the \u2018Hall of Valhalla\u2019. He made the entire battlefield including the Golden palace into Asgard.</p><br/><p>With this, Nidhogg\u2019s power was amplified. It wasn\u2019t only for her, but everyone that from Valhalla could feel power filling them up.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg looked down at Tiamat. She, the protector God of Asgard, wasn\u2019t equal to Tiamat anymore. Nidhogg was a being above her.</p><br/><p>[\u201cI\u2019m-Rolling!\u201d]</p><br/><p>Nidhogg yelled. Tiamat flinched and a strong tail sweep slammed into Tiamat and made her fall. Tiamat cursed, asking if this was a tail sweep or a roll, but it didn\u2019t reach Nidhogg. In the first place, Nidhogg\u2019s authority didn\u2019t allow such words to come out.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg\u2019s power suppressed Tiamat. Tiamat let out a painful cry while lying on the ground and attempted to resist Nidhogg.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho raised his head and looked at the sky. He could see red letters with his \u2018eyes of the dragon\u2019. Jormungand, who had flown to the sky, was stretching its body to form a spear and was charing towards him.</p><br/><p>The Space snake Jormungand.</p><br/><p>The evil dragon.</p><br/><p>The enemy of Asgard whose fate was connected with Thor.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho had also prepared another method to face it. He activated several rune magic that he prepared when he returned to Asgard from Olympus at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo.\u201d</p><br/><p>He ordered as the master of Asgard. There was someone surging up from the back of the black dragon. It was a huge eagle that was Hraesvelgr\u2019s original body. Three was one more person riding its back besides Vedrfolnir, who had received the right to control his body instead of Hraesvelgr.</p><br/><p>A being Tae Ho called by using a great magic.</p><br/><p>The one standing in the battlefield instead of Siri and Bracky.</p><br/><p>He glared at Jormungand from the back of Hraesvelgr. He pulled Gram, the strongest Godly sword of Asgard, and roared.</p><br/><p>[Myth ranked saga]</p><br/><p>[The one that kills dragons]</p><br/><p>The dragon killer Sigurd.</p><br/><p>The strongest top ranked warrior of Valhalla.</p><br/><p>He charged towards Jormungand and released his dragon killing powers.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 69 \u2013 Absolutely Invincible (1) &gt; End</p><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/>\n</div>"}

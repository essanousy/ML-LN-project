He just looked and cried once again.</p><br/><p>He knew that light.</p><br/><p>He wanted to see it once again.</p><br/><p>The light would shine brighter the deeper and darker the darkness is.</p><br/><p>Merlin laughed and understood. The light was too small to shine on the entire battlefield but regardless of that everyone in the battlefield noticed the identity of that light.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t only limited to Camelot.</p><br/><p>In addition, it wasn\u2019t only Camelot\u2019s by now.</p><br/><p>The Fairy god sword Excalibur.</p><br/><p>Erin\u2019s god sword.</p><br/><p>The light shining from the successor of Erin and the real king of Erin would be the last light Erin left!</p><br/><p>\u201cMy king.\u201d</p><br/><p>Merlin said. He cried because of the previous king that had passed away and claimed towards the new king.</p><br/><p>The knights of the round table that passed away first.</p><br/><p>The knights that had sacrificed what little remained of their souls and protected their king.</p><br/><p>He looked at him instead of them and faced him.</p><br/><p>The light surged up.</p><br/><p>It extended through the sky and split the clouds. The golden light split the world like the light of the creation of the world.</p><br/><p>The beautiful light.</p><br/><p>The one that was similar to the light that surged up from the tips of the hands of King Arthur.</p><br/><p>It was the light of Erin.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>The black magic broke away and the power of the curse got purified.</p><br/><p>The magician king stepped back. He got pushed back as much as he was pushing down.</p><br/><p>The golden light completely covered his eyes. It was surging up to the sky.</p><br/><p>The magician king shuddered. He froze at the light he thought he would never see again.</p><br/><p>And it was the same for the others.</p><br/><p>The Gods of Asgard and the warriors of Valhalla.</p><br/><p>The giant kings of Jotunheim and the monsters.</p><br/><p>They were all looking at one place and they soon realized. They thought of the same yet opposite things.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun\u2019s warrior!\u201d</p><br/><p>The magician king roared and increased his magic power. He gulped down the magi that got released every time he vomited black blood.</p><br/><p>But it was in vain. It was a childish thing that would destroy his soul and body. But he needed to do that. If he wanted to crush down Idun\u2019s warrior- the king of Erin, he also needed to put his life at stake!</p><br/><p>\u201cExcalibur.\u201d</p><br/><p>Someone said.</p><br/><p>And the world that had stopped like a lie started to move once again. The place everyone looked was a single place and they also moved to the same direction.</p><br/><p>The giant kings were heading towards Tae Ho but this time the warriors of Valhalla blocked their path.</p><br/><p>The king of the depths of the earth Trombe tried to dig down once again but SIri and Hraesvelg stopped him. The giant of Night Avalt squeezed out magic desperately and dispersed Bracky\u2019s lightning.</p><br/><p>The giant of Sea Grund got tied down by WItacheon. Heimdal and Njord arrived in front of the giants that had left the warriors they were facing and were turning around. They, that protected the fortress of Valhalla every time, released their divine power without saving it at the most important battlefield.</p><br/><p>Even the few commanders that remained behind to protect Valhalla headed to the same place. Rather than facing the enemies in front of them they ran towards the streak of light shining brightly in the center of the battlefield.</p><br/><p>It seemed like the entire battlefield got swept by a storm and the place Tae Ho and the magician king were could be called as the eye of the storm.</p><br/><p>It was silent. It seemed like all the battle cries, cries and yells got blocked.</p><br/><p>The ones trying to kill and the ones trying to stop them.</p><br/><p>A superb balance of strength got formed and a battlefield for only the two of them got created.</p><br/><p>It would only last a few moments.</p><br/><p>Or perhaps shorter than that.</p><br/><p>But it was enough to settle things.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho looked at the magician king while holding Excalibur. He grasped the strong magic the magician king was preparing with the \u2018eyes of the dragon\u2019 and then moved his mouth faster than him.</p><br/><p>[Saga: The warrior that had a Goddess meet him]</p><br/><p>The Valkyries got summoned. He cursed out to things like the battlefield meant only for the two of them and activated several sagas.</p><br/><p>[Saga: The warrior\u2019s equipment]</p><br/><p>[Saga: The legendary pro gamer]</p><br/><p>[Saga: The hammer of the blacksmith doesn\u2019t slip]</p><br/><p>The Valkyries stood their weapons and spread. Then charged towards the magician king.</p><br/><p>The fake Reginleif blew the Valkyrie horn and amplified the strength of the nine Valkyries that got summoned.</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard!\u201d</p><br/><p>The magician king let out a roar. He emitted a strong curse magic to try to scatter the fake Valkyries but it wasn\u2019t possible. The glory of Erin was protecting them.</p><br/><p>Rasgrid slashed the ankle of the magician king.</p><br/><p>Ingrid stabbed an opening in his armor with her holy spear. It was the spear that had defeated the first field monster, the Kraken.</p><br/><p>That wasn\u2019t the end. The fake Scathach, that was particularly strong even among them, messed up with the magic of the magician king that was about to be completed with the sword of light that she swung.</p><br/><p>The magician king moved his hands roughly and the fake Gandur disappeared at that rough attack. Rasgrid got crushed and Ingrid got thrown to the ground and couldn\u2019t move.</p><br/><p>The magician king still looked at Tae Ho at that moment but Tae Ho decided to wait for that magician king. He made him not able to look at another place by chasing his movements.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha.</p><br/><p>There was no need to call for her. She wasn\u2019t incompetent at all. She stood up and transformed into a sea serpent. She fired an ice breath at his chest that got exposed because he was too concentrated on Tae Ho!</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t possible to inflict a fatal damage but it was an unforeseen attack. The head of the magician king got dizzier and he lost Tae Ho for a moment.</p><br/><p>He turned around immediately but Tae Ho had already disappeared.</p><br/><p>Where?</p><br/><p>He rolled his eyes and could see him. Tae Ho jumped up and fell down diagonally while drawing a beautiful trajectory. In addition he wasn\u2019t only holding Excalibur in his hands.</p><br/><p>The sword of the knight of the sun Gawain.</p><br/><p>His sword of the sun that was like his trademark!</p><br/><p>[Saga: Sword of the sun]</p><br/><p>Gallatin shone in his left hand and it emitted an overwhelming power as if to prove that the time was close to midday.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho poured down attacks.</p><br/><p>It was a technique that only belonged to Kalsted\u2019s techniques and didn\u2019t have Scathach\u2019s techniques in it.</p><br/><p>The two hand sword techniques that was executed by using two swords.</p><br/><p>Martial arts like this couldn\u2019t exist in reality at all.</p><br/><p>But it did exist in Dark Age. The dragon knight Kalsted could obviously wield two pair of swords and he could also wield two huge spears freely.</p><br/><p>Two wings.</p><br/><p>The two swords became a pair of wings. The lights of Erin and the sun became fire and lightning and covered the magician king.</p><br/><p>The magician king clenched his fists. He released the magic he had gathered once again at random. He pushed away Tae Ho and then swung magical blades to tear apart the fake Valkyries. He also called for a huge lightning as if wanting to die together.</p><br/><p>Kwagagang!</p><br/><p>Black lightning fell down. It then split in a hundred and covered the ground.</p><br/><p>Njord didn\u2019t turn to look around. He just focused on cutting the path from reaching Tae Ho and the magician king by creating waves and hails. It wasn\u2019t different for Heimdall.</p><br/><p>Bracky and Siri also did the same. The ones that rather got impatient were the giants.</p><br/><p>The world wolf that increased in size once again roared. It stepped down on Rolo and tried to charge to the place the magician king was at.</p><br/><p>But Nidhogg also didn\u2019t stay still. She let out a roar instead of trembling. She made her body rose even though its neck got torn off. Because it wasn\u2019t her essence. It was her magic armor.</p><br/><p>She could fight even though she got her neck torn off and could still fight even if she became worse than that.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why she had to fight. She had to stand up and stop it.</p><br/><p>The black dragon attacked the world wolf from behind. The wolf, that wasn\u2019t in perfect conditions due to the lethal damage inflicted by Hraesvelg, couldn\u2019t dodge the attack perfectly. It got time taken by the black dragon.</p><br/><p>It was the first time she tried controlling the body from a distance. It was hard and difficult. The pain that was still transmitted in this moment bit down on her consciousness.</p><br/><p>But she didn\u2019t fall down. She glared at the world wolf even while crying.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe strongest one shall accompany you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hraesvelg entrusted Trombe to Siri and Juh Palgye and laughed. Nidhogg also ordered an impossible movement to her body that was rolling on the ground.</p><br/><p>The world wolf and the ancient dragon and king of birds.</p><br/><p>The battle of the monsters resumed once more time and time kept flowing.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho slashed away the black lightning that fell down by swinging Excalibur and Gallatin and looked at the magician king and his surroundings with \u2018the eyes of the dragon\u2019. He activated his saga once again.</p><br/><p>[Saga: The warrior that had a Goddess meet him]</p><br/><p>Heda appeared next to Tae Ho. She wasn\u2019t the fake but the real one. She got bewildered as she was transmitting her strength as Idun but she then understood Tae Ho\u2019s thoughts. It was possible as she was connected to him with Idun\u2019s warrior.</p><br/><p>Heda embraced Tae Ho from behind. The magician king barely recovered to the point he could take a breath and watched Tae Ho while panting. He put his guard towards the Goddess that had a strong divine power and hurriedly prepared some magic.</p><br/><p>\u201cMcLaren!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho yelled. The summoning rock activated and McLaren surged up by piercing the ground.</p><br/><p>A rock serpent was merely a bug in front of the magician king.</p><br/><p>But it didn\u2019t matter.</p><br/><p>That wasn\u2019t important.</p><br/><p>McLaren covered Tae Ho for a moment and at that moment something the magician king had never imagined happened.</p><br/><p>[Saga: The warrior that had a Goddess meet him]</p><br/><p>Switching places.</p><br/><p>The fake heda.</p><br/><p>She was in the group of nine that got summoned at the start but she didn\u2019t attack the magician king like the others. She just hid herself.</p><br/><p>Black lightning fell and McLaren surged up.</p><br/><p>The fake Heda stood behind the magician king. She took a leap the moment McLaren surged up to stand behind him.</p><br/><p>The fake Heda disappeared and the real Heda appeared in that place. Tae Ho, that was embraced treasuredly by Heda, also crossed space.</p><br/><p>The magician king realized it. He got surprised but he couldn\u2019t look back.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t because it was too late. There was another reason.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Asgard and the nine realms.\u201d</p><br/><p>The last words Loki left behind and the nasty curse his last will made.</p><br/><p>His will that was mixed in his magic stopped the movements of the magician king. It incapacitated his movements in an instant.</p><br/><p>\u201cLoki!\u201d</p><br/><p>The magician king yelled like a scream. Odin cried and Tae Ho roared!</p><br/><p>Excalibur and Gallatin pierced the neck of the magician king. It made the tens of meter big magician king fall forwards.</p><br/><p>The ground shook. Excalibur and Gallatin released a stronger light even though they were stuck in the body of the magician king.</p><br/><p>The magician king struggled. He released his magic power randomly. A strong power that could destroy the ground and tear the sky swept the surroundings.</p><br/><p>Heda protected Tae Ho with all her strength. The brilliance of Idun\u2019s golden light protected the two people.</p><br/><p>The magician king tried to stand up with his trembling limbs. Tae Ho let his hands go from his swords instead of putting more strength.</p><br/><p>Why?</p><br/><p>The one that had the doubt was the magician king.</p><br/><p>His head was still working clearly even though he was suffering a terrible pain.</p><br/><p>And he could find the answer.</p><br/><p>But the answer was really terrible.</p><br/><p>The sentence of the Milesian.</p><br/><p>Excalibur taught him the moment it pierced the neck of the magician king.</p><br/><p>It told the king of Erin, the success of Erin that would inherit everything from Erin.</p><br/><p>The thing the magician king was hiding.</p><br/><p>THe piece that was stuck so deep he couldn\u2019t remove it.</p><br/><p>\u2018Come! Spear of death!\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn roared. Tae Ho woke up the last piece through the sentence of the Milesian.</p><br/><p>The spear of death.</p><br/><p>The vivo of the land of darkness.</p><br/><p>The real and only soul companion of the great hero Cuchulainn!</p><br/><p>Tae Ho gripped the air and at that moment, the old wound of the magician king opened once again. The last piece of Gae Bolg surged up and headed to the spear of death that was in Tae Ho\u2019s right hand.</p><br/><p>The magician king roared like a beast but it was meaningless. Excalibur and Gallatin emanated light once again and sealed the movements of the magician king. Tae Ho concentrated all his strength on the completed spear of death- the real Gae Bolg.</p><br/><p>\u201cNoooooooo!\u201d</p><br/><p>The giant of Night Avalt despaired. Scathach watched this moment as the queen of the land of shadow.</p><br/><p>Erin and the sun.</p><br/><p>A nasty darkness exploded from between the two bright light. The spear of death coveted the life of the magician king!</p><br/><p>The magician king couldn\u2019t endure it anymore. He had already received a fatal wound by Loki. He had barely managed to endure Excalibur and Gallatin but he was already at his limit. He couldn\u2019t resist the power of death that was added in the last moment.</p><br/><p>The curse of Gae Bolg destroyed the heart of the magician king. The magician king smiled bitterly instead of despairing.</p><br/><p>He admitted his end as one that hoped for the destruction of the world.</p><br/><p>Avalt fell down in his place and Grund wailed.</p><br/><p>A storm of light wailed.</p><br/><p>It was the light that was emitted by the overwhelming amount of runes that had started to surge up from the corpse of the magician king.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho raised his head from between that. He had defeated the magician king but the battle hadn\u2019t ended yet.</p><br/><p>There was one more enemy he had to defeat.</p><br/><p>The world wolf Fenrir.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho looked in front of him.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 45 \u2013 King of Erin (1) &gt; End</p><hr/><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/>\n</div>"}

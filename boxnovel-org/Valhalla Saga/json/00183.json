It was impossible for a nymph and a lesser God of the sea to go against the will of the greater Gods.</p><br/><p>What was fortunate was that Peleus loved Thetis sincerely and that he was simple and devoted even among the human heroes.</p><br/><p>Thetis accepted Peleus\u2019 feelings not too long after and then had a child with him and that child was the one that would be born with the fate to become greater than his father such as the prophecy of Prometheus, Achilles.</p><br/><p>Thethis, who loved Achilles too much, tried to do everything she could for him.</p><br/><p>First, she soaked him in the river Styx several times and gave him a body of steel.</p><br/><p>She even focused on his education and entrusted him to Chiron, the great master of all the heroes including Heracles.</p><br/><p>Achilles mastered the best spearmanship of Olympus under Chiron, participated in the war of Troy that was called the war of heroes, massacred countless heroes and obtained the title of \u2018hero killer\u2019.</p><br/><p>He ended up dying at the end of the war but that was merely a new starting point for Achilles.</p><br/><p>The God of kings Zeus retrieved the soul of Achilles when it entered Elysium and accepted him as his own great hero. This was the real start of the great hero Achilles.</p><br/><p>\u201cAchilles has two weapons that are especially strong. One is his shield and the other one is his spear. The two of them are weapons forged by Gods directly.</p><br/><p>The one that made Achilles\u2019 shield was the blacksmithing God that controls fire, Hephaestus.</p><br/><p>Hephaestus was chased away from Olympus when he was young with the reason that he had a disorder and the one that picked him up and raised him was Achilles\u2019 mother Thetis.</p><br/><p>Because of that Thetis was like a mother for Hephaestus and Thetis\u2019 child Achilles was like a step brother for him.</p><br/><p>Hephaestus received a request from Thetis to make a shield which he worked on for an entire night and this became Achilles\u2019 shield.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe shield of Achilles will never get destroyed. It received the attacks of countless heroes but only a scratch was made on it. In addition, the shield of Achilles can absorb all kinds of attacks. Be it inflicted by a sword or magic.\u201d</p><br/><p>The spear of Achilles was a weapon made directly from Chiron when he wasn\u2019t a God yet.</p><br/><p>Chiron gifted Achilles a spear himself as he grew as the most astounding spearman among his disciples and Achilles killed a lot of heroes with that spear.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat spear was made with a meteorite so it was called as the meteorite spear but it\u2019s now called the hero killer spear thanks to Achilles\u2019 performance. Just looking at it as a simple spear, you could say that it\u2019s the best weapon of Olympus.\u201d</p><br/><p>A divinity of a demigod.</p><br/><p>A body like steel that blades wouldn\u2019t work on.</p><br/><p>The best spearmanship on Olympus and the fastest feet.</p><br/><p>In addition, two special weapons.</p><br/><p>There was a reason he was named as a great hero even among the countless heroes.</p><br/><p>Not even the pure Gods Deimos or Phobos were a match for him.</p><br/><p>Not even the 12 Olympians were able to defeat him if they weren\u2019t proficient in battle. That was who Achilles was.</p><br/><p>But he was charging right towards him.</p><br/><p>The intent of Achilles that had killed countless heroes was really overwhelming. His intent made others kneel down just with charging.</p><br/><p>The great hero of Zeus.</p><br/><p>The hero killer.</p><br/><p>The best spearmanship that could make even Gods kneel down.</p><br/><p>\u2018So, what are you lacking in?\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn asked.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t fear Achilles at all. It wasn\u2019t because he was the strongest hero that represented Erin.</p><br/><p>He wouldn\u2019t fall behind him.</p><br/><p>To Achilles. Tae Ho wouldn\u2019t fall behind the great hero that seemed like he was born with a golden spoon since he was born.</p><br/><p>Bathing in the river Styx?</p><br/><p>Tae Ho had eaten the apple of youth several times that the Goddess of youth administered. He even ate the peaches that were sent from the Temple.</p><br/><p>The greatest master of Olympus?</p><br/><p>They had the greatest master of Erin. Scathach\u2019s spearmanship didn\u2019t fall behind to Chiron\u2019s spearmanship at all. No, Cuchulainn rather claimed that it was better.</p><br/><p>Weapons made by Gods?</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn laughed at that. He could only do so.</p><br/><p>\u2018He dares to boast with only two weapons?\u2019</p><br/><p>Arondight was retrieved from Tae Ho\u2019s hands. And the weapon that he grabbed instead of it was Gae Bolg, the best spear of death of all the spears of Erin.</p><br/><p>In addition, several equipment were added to Tae Ho\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Each one of them were equipment that had a legend behind it.</p><br/><p>Speed setting.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho didn\u2019t dodge the charging Achilles. He rather faced and charged towards him.</p><br/><p>A conspicuous light shone on Achilles\u2019 eyes facing Tae Ho. It was because it had been too long since someone charged towards him since Hector, who was equal to him in the war of Troy.</p><br/><p>The first meeting was a clash between two spears.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t last too long. They slipped off from each other and the two of them, that had fast speeds that got ahead of the gale, passed each other.</p><br/><p>They could know with this attack.</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t completely grasp the abilities of the other but they realized that it wasn\u2019t shallow at all.</p><br/><p>Achilles moved his feet lightly on the surface where Hermes\u2019 divine power still remained and on the place the magic circle disappeared at.</p><br/><p>He somewhat understood the situation. He was sure that Hermes took Athena and her group and escaped.</p><br/><p>But it wasn\u2019t all bad.</p><br/><p>He had the man in front of him to thank for that.</p><br/><p>He would have regretted it if he missed the man in front of him even if he did catch Athena.</p><br/><p>Idun\u2019s warrior.</p><br/><p>The top ranked warrior of Asgard that was equal to a great hero of Olympus.</p><br/><p>Achilles put on a smile at his feelings of wanting to win.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho faced him and smiled bitterly.</p><br/><p>He had expected it but he wasn\u2019t an opponent he could beat easily. That\u2019s why he needed a change in plans.</p><br/><p>He would forget about Ares.</p><br/><p>Also that he was breaking Hades\u2019 barrier and that he would have to leave him out from his pursuit.</p><br/><p>He just focused on the opponent in front of him. It was no different to the countless battles he had in the tower of shadows.</p><br/><p>They clashed once again.</p><br/><p>The both of them were really fast. The exchange between spears was so fast it was hard to chase it with your eyes.</p><br/><p>The collision didn\u2019t ring that much. Achilles\u2019 fighting style of holding a spear in one hand and a big round shield in another resembled his father Peleus and it was unexpectedly steady.</p><br/><p>The basics were defending by using his shield and the spear was meant for counter attacking after defending.</p><br/><p>Because of that Tae Ho attacked more times than Achilles but most of them were being blocked by Achilles\u2019 shield.</p><br/><p>The shield Hephaestus had forged was special just like Patroclus had said.</p><br/><p>They absorbed Tae Ho\u2019s attacks and didn\u2019t leave any shock. In addition, it even absorbed the sound created by the collision.</p><br/><p>Originally, even if you blocked an attack perfectly with your shield, it would still inflict some damage to the defender. But the shield of Achilles was different. Achilles didn\u2019t get hurt at all as his shield absorbed all the shock.</p><br/><p>After his attack, Achilles\u2019 sharp counterattack started. Tae Ho dodged them rather than blocking them and naturally, Achilles attack only tore the air. The loud sound generated when steel clashed against steel didn\u2019t ring.</p><br/><p>Countless attacks were exchanged in a short time.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho grope for a method to defeat Achilles like had always did.</p><br/><p>First his shield.</p><br/><p>He thought of a strategy and then executed it.</p><br/><p>[Saga: The warrior that had a Goddess meet him]</p><br/><p>After a turn of attack and defense was exchanged, six Valkyries were summoned next to Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t hold any weapon and charged towards Achilles from different directions.</p><br/><p>Sigrun, Gudrun, Hildegarde, Rasgrid, Kaldea, Hrist.</p><br/><p>Achilles didn\u2019t become perplexed. He executed attacks calmly and removed the fake Valkyries.</p><br/><p>It was blindingly fast. It was to the point where three stabs were seen as only one.</p><br/><p>Sigrun and Gudrun disappeared even before they could approach him. Hildegarde and Hrist took one more step but that was all.</p><br/><p>Achilles swung his shield and grinded Kaldea. The last one, Rasgrid, got near Achilles but she ended up having her chest pierced.</p><br/><p>Only one breath.</p><br/><p>The six Valkyries disappeared in only one breath of time. And thanks to that, Achilles couldn\u2019t react properly.</p><br/><p>A bomb exploded.</p><br/><p>They were the bombs the fake Valkyries were holding. In the first place, Tae Ho had made the Valkyries charge forward with the intention of blowing them all up.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a normal bomb.</p><br/><p>If it was just an explosion or magic, it wouldn\u2019t be able to pierce through Achilles\u2019 shield. Even Achilles\u2019 steel like body may be able to endure the explosion.</p><br/><p>But what exploded from the bomb was green poison.</p><br/><p>The poison of the black dragon Nidhogg.</p><br/><p>It was something Nidhogg accumulated and condensed before she lost her hundred meter big body.</p><br/><p>Achilles stopped breathing and tried to resist at the poison with his divinity but it wasn\u2019t easy.</p><br/><p>The wind generated by swinging his spear and shield pushed away the poison at the outside but he couldn\u2019t do anything about the poison that exploded close to him.</p><br/><p>He took a breath. The poison dug through his skin.</p><br/><p>And Tae Ho charged at that moment.</p><br/><p>[Arachne\u2019s necklace]</p><br/><p>[Earring of a poison dragon]</p><br/><p>[Regenerating snake skin]</p><br/><p>[Waistband of health]</p><br/><p>Poison resistance setting.</p><br/><p>It was the setting he had prepared when Nidhogg was making the bombs of condensed poison.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho reacted immediately at Tae Ho\u2019s attack when he passed through the poison but his limbs were out of sync. He could only defend with his shield and not counterattack.</p><br/><p>The poison was disappearing. Tae Ho retrieved his spear after one set of attacks and then activated his saga.</p><br/><p>[Saga: The warrior that had a Goddess meet him]</p><br/><p>This time three fake Valkyries appeared.</p><br/><p>Ingrid, Gandur and Reginleif.</p><br/><p>They were the three strong Valkyries that had a high completion rate and were especially strong.</p><br/><p>Ingrid grabbed Achilles\u2019 thighs. Gandur and Reginleif grabbed one arm each.</p><br/><p>Originally, Achilles should have been able to shake them off but he was weakened due to Nidhogg\u2019s poison. He couldn\u2019t help but have his arms spread.</p><br/><p>Achilles let out a howl and glared in front of him. He saw Tae Ho and Tae Ho also saw him. He executed a stab at his chest without hesitation.</p><br/><p>There was no sound. The shield that left Achilles\u2019 arm by its own stopped Tae Ho\u2019s attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cUooo!\u201d</p><br/><p>Achilles let out a roar behind the shield that was floating in the air. He swung his arms and removed Gandur and Reginleif and then swung his fist with the hand he was grabbing his spear and crushed Ingrid.</p><br/><p>But at that moment Tae Ho extended his hand.</p><br/><p>What he was aiming for when he made the Valkyries charge towards him was to attack his chest but he was also taking into account this situation.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho grabbed Achilles\u2019 shield and Achilles looked at that Tae Ho and laughed fiercely. He clenched his left fist as a signal and tried to pull his shield and Tae Ho at the same time.</p><br/><p>But Tae Ho was a bit faster.</p><br/><p>[Saga: His pocket is connected to a treasure vault]</p><br/><p>Achilles\u2019 shield disappeared in the air. Achilles opened his eyes widely and Cuchulainn cheered.</p><br/><p>\u2018It clearly is a cheat!\u2019</p><br/><p>It was impossible to take it and use it for himself right now. Not letting him use it was the best he could do but it was enough with that.</p><br/><p>Achilles hurriedly grabbed his spear properly and Tae Ho poured down attacks that were like lightning.</p><br/><p>Scathach\u2019s style technique.</p><br/><p>Lightning stab.</p><br/><p>The spear clashed against the spear with sounds like thunder.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 53 \u2013 Legend of a Hero (2) &gt; End</p><hr/><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/>\n</div>"}

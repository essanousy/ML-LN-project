I have been able to recover part of my strength thanks to you.]</p><br/><p>[We will be able to speak longer in this place.]</p><br/><p>A really nice to hear the sweet voice come out from Sybilla who was sitting on the altar in front of the sanctum of Apollo.</p><br/><p>It was the real voice of Apollo the God of light and also the God of music and poetry.</p><br/><p>\u2018There\u2019s certainly more strength in his voice than when he was in the small shrine. It seems like it was worth having recovered the shrine of Delfos.\u2019</p><br/><p>In the small shrine, only Sybilla\u2019s way of speaking had changed and the voice remained hers.</p><br/><p>But that wasn\u2019t all.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho could sense a change besides what Cuchulainn mentioned.</p><br/><p>\u2018Something\u2019s different.\u2019</p><br/><p>He had met several strong Gods even in Asgard and felt the dignity of a God that had a strong presence.</p><br/><p>But it was too lacking compared to now. Tae Ho sensed a strength from Apollo\u2019s divinity.</p><br/><p>And he soon realized the reason for it.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t because Apollo\u2019s divinity was actually stronger than the Gods of Asgard such as Idun and Freya or even Thor and Odin.</p><br/><p>It was because Tae Ho\u2019s own divinity had woken up.</p><br/><p>There was a saying that you could only see what you knew. There was something he could see because he was in the same ship as him, even though the difference in their divinities was clear.</p><br/><p>There was a big difference in what the human Lee Tae Ho and the God Lee Tae Ho could feel even when facing the same divinity.</p><br/><p>If the former was facing the other with layers in between them, then the latter would be facing the other without any kind of obstacles.</p><br/><p>What will happen if he met Idun in his condition? How would Idun be felt?</p><br/><p>And what about Heda?</p><br/><p>Tae Ho thought of the faces of the two people that popped up naturally. He looked at Apollo that had manifested in Sybilla\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Apollo was in an incomplete state but even his broken divinity was strong as expected of one of the 12 Olympians.</p><br/><p>[Idun\u2019s hero. I want to give you a reward for having completed my quest.]</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s the weapon the past sun of the God Helios used. I received it long ago when I inherited his seat.]</p><br/><p>Apollo moved Sybilla\u2019s body. When he raised his hand lightly, a secret door that was hidden below the altar opened up and shiny particles of light started to come out of that.</p><br/><p>Sybilla moved her hand once again. An equipment emitting bright light surged up by its own and stopped in front of Tae Ho. it was a golden crown that could be worn and it had several sharp and pointy thorns that represented sunlight.</p><br/><p>[Crown of Helios]</p><br/><p>It was a rainbow colored word which he saw in a long time.</p><br/><p>\u2018The design is a bit excessive but it\u2019s performance seems to be sure.\u2019</p><br/><p>It did give an excessively flashy feeling just like Cuchulainn said but it was still an equipment that you could feel a strong power from.</p><br/><p>[Wear it. It seems like it will suit you.]</p><br/><p>Tae Ho was urged by Apollo and wore the crown as if equipping an item. At that moment, energy started to circulate in his body as if he had drank an energizer.</p><br/><p>[The power of the sun will enter you and greatly strengthen your vitality. Idun is also the Goddess of life so it will harmonize with the crown of Helios.]</p><br/><p>It was like Apollo had said. He felt like the blessing of Idun that saved him several times from the brink of death grow stronger by its own.</p><br/><p>\u2018The synergy with Gallatin will also be good.\u2019</p><br/><p>Because the Crown of Helios had the power of the sun in it. So it could only have good synergy with Gallatin that also had the power of the sun in it.</p><br/><p>\u2018So you are able to do that specialized setting or whatever?\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho nodded slightly at Cuchulainn\u2019s question. An item set with Gallatin and Helios as the core appeared in his mind by its own.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s leave it for later for now.\u2019</p><br/><p>Thinking about the item setting was one of his hobbies from when he was a gamer and one of his specialties but the conversation with Apollo mattered more right now.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho stored the Crown of Helios with his saga and then expressed Asgard\u2019s etiquette and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cApollo, I want to know about the changes that are occurring in Olympus.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t say any unnecessary words.</p><br/><p>Apollo stayed silent with the body of Sybilla he borrowed and then opened his mouth heavily.</p><br/><p>[You are the hero of another world. That\u2019s why telling you what I am going to is like exposing the secrets of Olympus to the outside.]</p><br/><p>[But as the God of rationality, I can\u2019t allow shaking away the strongest supporters I have right now.]</p><br/><p>Apollo was emotional suitable of being the God of poetry and music but he was also the God of rationality at the same time. He was able to make a decision with a cooler head than even Athena.</p><br/><p>[Idun\u2019s hero, do you know about the ones wishing to destroy the world and the ones trying to destroy it?]</p><br/><p>\u201cI know the general outline.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho started to speak of what he heard from Ragnar and Odin briefly.</p><br/><p>Apollo nodded and said.</p><br/><p>[You really do know the general outline just like you said. I will skip my explanation a bit then. Ask me if there\u2019s something you don\u2019t understand.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI will do so.\u201d</p><br/><p>Apollo let out a sigh as Tae Ho expressed etiquette and started his explanation.</p><br/><p>[Beings that wish to destroy the world and the ones trying to destroy it also exist in Olympus. The former are the Gods of Olympus and the latter are the titans of Tartarus.]</p><br/><p>[You can say that the basic structure is the same as Asgard up to this point.]</p><br/><p>The Gods that wanted to maintain the world and the giants that wished to destroy it.</p><br/><p>[But there\u2019s a decisive difference in Olympus and Asgard.]</p><br/><p>Apollo\u2019s voice became lower.</p><br/><p>[In the first place the Gods of Olympus share the same roots as the Titans compared to Asgard where the Gods and the giants of Jotunheim are different existences.]</p><br/><p>[We split up in two factions from a single root.]</p><br/><p>The Gods of Olympus and especially the 12 Olympians were Titans if you were to speak strictly.</p><br/><p>It meant that they belonged to the same race as the Titans of Tartarus.</p><br/><p>[My father, the king of Gods Zeus, is a Titan before being a God of Olympus. It\u2019s the same for his brother Poseidon and his wife, the queen of Gods Hera.]</p><br/><p>[And the same goes for me as I have the blood of father. Because of that, the Gods of Olympus have two personalities. It means that we haven\u2019t been able to completely lean to one side.]</p><br/><p>It was the same case as Loki that was born as someone wanting to maintain the world even though he was a giant of Jotunheim.</p><br/><p>[But of course, the Gods of Olympus including my father Zeus, are more inclined to maintain the world. In the first place the reason Titanomachy took place was because a certain generation of Titans having my father as the lead got born as beings wanting to maintain the world.]</p><br/><p>The war that occurred in the time the concept of God of Olympus didn\u2019t exist was Titanomachy.</p><br/><p>The concept of God of Olympus didn\u2019t exist so the battle that occured in the war was closer to being an internal affair between Titans.</p><br/><p>[But there was a change almost two months ago. The Gods that had a strong tendency to maintain the world had turned to become beings wanting to destroy it.]</p><br/><p>[The Gods of Olympus have two personalities in the first place but the change is too drastic. In addition, it isn\u2019t that the Gods changed by themselves. There was a voice that increased their tendency of wanting to destroy the world while pressing down their tendency to maintain the world.]</p><br/><p>There was grief in Apollo\u2019s voice. Tae Ho gulped dry saliva and concentrated. He pressed down his thoughts that the Kingdom of fire was the one behind it and waited for Apollo\u2019s next words.</p><br/><p>[Unfortunately, not even I know the exact identity of the voice. It\u2019s because I haven\u2019t even been able to hear it.]</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you saying that each God heard a different amount?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho asked reflexively. It was a sharp question as expected of someone that had learnt Scathach\u2019s style techniques.</p><br/><p>Apollo\u2019s face darkened.</p><br/><p>[That is right. I almost didn\u2019t hear the voice at all but thanks to that, my beloved sister Artemis heard a lot of that voice. She turned into someone wanting to destroy the world and attacked me.]</p><br/><p>Apollo put on a teary expression with Sybilla\u2019s face. Dense sorrow showed up in his beautiful voice.</p><br/><p>[I didn\u2019t turn into someone wanting to destroy the world as I almost didn\u2019t hear the voice but I also haven\u2019t been able to find out anything about that voice. Such as the owner of the voice and how it awoke our side of wanting to destroy the world that is deep inside of us.]</p><br/><p>\u2018There\u2019s a high probability it\u2019s the Titans of Tartarus with the rule of elimination\u2026\u2026.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn paused.</p><br/><p>It was because the probabilities for that were low.</p><br/><p>Apollo heard Cuchulainn\u2019s voice just like Odin did. That\u2019s why he shook his head.</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m doubtful if they have a power like that. That\u2019s why I\u2019m thinking of another existence besides them.]</p><br/><p>Someone that could give a strong influence to the Gods of Olympus that had the blood of Titans flowing in their veins.</p><br/><p>Someone that could even force his will to the king of Gods Zeus.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho thought of a phrase of a greek mythology.</p><br/><p>Apollo continued to speak in a low voice.</p><br/><p>[The one that led the Titans in the Titanomachy. The king of Gods that ruled the world before the Gods of Olympus. The one that attacked my father and took away the seat as the king of Gods and got his seat taken once again by the youngest son.]</p><br/><p>Zeus\u2019 father.</p><br/><p>The usurper of the past that had faced his son in the Titanomachy.</p><br/><p>[Titan Kronos.]</p><br/><p>[The first Titan that started the genealogy of the Gods of Olympus.]</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>Night passed and morning came.</p><br/><p>The owner of Delfos had changed but the patrolling at day and night remained the same.</p><br/><p>Three mornings and three nights.</p><br/><p>There was a group that marched the fourth day the owner of Delfos changed and when the sun was its peak.</p><br/><p>It was the army of Artemis.</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t only monsters but there were also human hunters and nymphs that had pledged their allegiance. The monsters that had fled four days ago had also regrouped with them.</p><br/><p>The one leading the army was Atalante.</p><br/><p>She, who had the title of the fastest hero along with Achilles, looked at a far place while holding the bow she received directly from Artemis. The destroyed walls of Delfos entered her beautiful red eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe blessing of Apollo isn\u2019t working.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hipomenes, that was next to her, said. He was also Atalante\u2019s lover just like Meleager was.</p><br/><p>The reason the walls of Delfos were called impregnable wasn\u2019t simply because they were high and thick. It was because the walls themselves had the blessing of Apollo so it was hard to even make a dent on them.</p><br/><p>But the blessing of Apollo wasn\u2019t felt even though it wasn\u2019t like the time the monsters of Artemis took over Delfos and inflicted a big injury to Apollo so he wasn\u2019t able to use his powers.</p><br/><p>Was it a trap to make them lower their guards?</p><br/><p>Atalante thought about it for a moment but then shook her head. In the first place, the other side didn\u2019t even have a proper force. There was no one to protect the walls even if they blessed the walls so there was a high probability Apollo was saving his strength.</p><br/><p>Atalante rode on a monster hog of Kalidon and ordered the army to increased the marching speed.</p><br/><p>The monsters amounting to twenty thousand weren\u2019t clustered but spread away. It was one of the countermeasures they had taken against the rolling attack.</p><br/><p>Artemis didn\u2019t drop her guard as she had already lost Orion and Meleager to Tae Ho. She gathered all of the heroes under Artemis and made a hero hunter troop.</p><br/><p>Actually, the main force of this army wasn\u2019t the twenty thousand monsters but the hero hunter troop that had Atalante at the lead.</p><br/><p>Atalante raised her senses to prepare for unexpected surprise attacks but she didn\u2019t feel a presence until she reached Delfos. There wasn\u2019t even an attack that obstructed from entering.</p><br/><p>An empty castle.</p><br/><p>Delfos was empty. Only the traces of the last battle that hadn\u2019t been cleaned up greeted Atalante and her army.</p><br/><p>Atalante was really bewildered. It was because this place was none other than Delfos. It was the most important city for Apollo\u2019s sacred force.</p><br/><p>They just abandoned Delfos which they had just taken back?</p><br/><p>It was hard to understand. If they were going to do that, then why did they recapture Delfos?</p><br/><p>Atalante loosened her forces and ordered them to search Delfos. She was already sensing instinctively that there was no one left in this city but she couldn\u2019t stay still.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a letter that was discovered in the entrance of the shrine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hipomenes approached hurriedly and gave her the letter. The contents in the sheep leather scroll was as following.</p><br/><p>[I will give you Delfos but I\u2019m the one that decides which city to attack.]</p><br/><p>[PD: It won\u2019t take that long. Perhaps, right now?]</p><br/><p>Atalante opened her eyes widely and looked at her surroundings hurriedly.</p><br/><p>There was still no presence and it didn\u2019t seem like anyone would attack.</p><br/><p>But Atalante realized one fact and that fact made her feel troubled.</p><br/><p>The one that had tricked them saying that he was a hero of Freya by himself- and the one that was estimated to be Idun\u2019s warrior had left Delfos. The army of Artemis could place their hands on Delfos once again.</p><br/><p>But that wasn\u2019t the end.</p><br/><p>The hero of Idun had taken over Delfos with only ten members. It was close to impossible to grasp his movements as it wasn\u2019t an army but a small group.</p><br/><p>That guy didn\u2019t stay in Delfos. He rather gave it away and got the attacking right.</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t attack as she didn\u2019t know where he was. It was also impossible to gather the forces in a certain polis as they didn\u2019t know where he would attack from.</p><br/><p>It meant that it was impossible to track his location before he attacked one place.</p><br/><p>And what that meant.</p><br/><p>Atalante bit her lips. All of the polises of Apollo that were taken over and also the polises of Artemis were placed at the tip of her spear.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t something that would be solved by conquering all the remaining polises of Apollo because he could take over a polis even without an army. He wasn\u2019t Apollo\u2019s hero but Idun\u2019s hero.</p><br/><p>The only thing they could do was to make the most preparations possible.</p><br/><p>\u201cSet a post station hurriedly! We have to prepare for the attack of Idun\u2019s hero!\u201d</p><br/><p>The hunters that had quick feet left Delfos and scattered at Atalante\u2019s order. She cursed out and looked at the broken walls.</p><br/><p>Idun\u2019s hero.</p><br/><p>Where will you come from? Could she stay behind in Delfos? What would happen if the other polises get attacked while she was here? What if Delfos gets attacked once again when she leaves?</p><br/><p>Atalante\u2019s head filled with thoughts but she couldn\u2019t come up with a clear answer. Raising the defenses as best she could was the best possible option.</p><br/><p>And when Atalante\u2019s worry was deepening.</p><br/><p>Four days ago Tae Ho left Delfos as soon as his conversation with Apollo ended and headed to the west, that was the opposite of the direction where the polises of Artemis were at.</p><br/><p>He had recovered part of Apollo\u2019s divine power with the retrieval of Delfos\u2019 hallow. He would get weaker once again when Delfos got taken over but it would still be better than having the hallow and Delfos taken.</p><br/><p>They had put off the urgent fire for now.</p><br/><p>It would be better to recover Apollo\u2019s divine power with other methods and regroup with Athena.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t even want to attack the polises of Artemis. In her position, it would be normal for Tae Ho to attack to weaken her divine power or recover Apollo\u2019s divine power but that was only in the point of view of Artemis.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho didn\u2019t have a slightest reason to reach a conclusion with Artemis.</p><br/><p>They would scare them and buy time.</p><br/><p>They would look as if they were about to attack but turn around and walk their own paths.</p><br/><p>The group\u2019s trip would be safer the later they realized that they had been tricked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Evil bastard. You really can only be the God of cheating. God of trickery.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn said in a good mood and Tae Ho didn\u2019t refute it. He headed towards the west with Patroclus\u2019 lead.</p><br/><p>The land where the core of the Goddess of warfare\u2019s sacred force was at.</p><br/><p>It was towards the polis of Athens.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 50 \u2013 God of Sun (5) &gt; End</p><br/>\n</div>"}

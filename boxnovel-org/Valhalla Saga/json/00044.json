It was because they had already fought two fierce battles even though it didn\u2019t last too long.</p><br/><p>Siri was the one that was especially exhausted. Even though she was supported by the sagas, the flight Tae Ho requested her to do was of a really high level. In addition, it wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to say that she had fought Garmr alone.</p><br/><p>The moment Tae Ho activated the \u2018one that handles dragons\u2019 he realized that Siri\u2019s exhaustion was quite big. Perhaps Siri putting on a teary face that wasn\u2019t like her was already proof of that.</p><br/><p>\u201cHang on a little bit more captain Siri.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho lowered his posture after whispering to her and then transmitted his strategy.</p><br/><p>In the first place, Tae Ho wasn\u2019t planning on intervening against Rasgrid\u2019s fight against the fire giant directly.</p><br/><p>Because they were on a different level. The two of them weren\u2019t beings that Tae Ho could currently face.</p><br/><p>\u201cListen well, our objective isn\u2019t dealing damage. It\u2019s to take the aggro.\u201d</p><br/><p>They would let Rasgrid do all the attacking. Their task was to not let the fire giant defend or dodge properly, or keep disturbing it.</p><br/><p>Siri just entrusted her body to Tae Ho\u2019s saga instead of asking anymore. Tae Ho faced the giant and Rasgrid that were far away and flew up and instead of putting away Garmr\u2019s soul fragment inside of Unnir he held it with his left arm.</p><br/><p>The thing the fire giant was looking for was Garmr\u2019s soul fragment. Then what would happen if he kept showing it to the giant? Just like a fisherman shaking the bait.</p><br/><p>\u2018Also.\u2019</p><br/><p>He would attack the top of that. It wasn\u2019t important if he could actually damage it. It would be worth it if he could keep getting on its nerves.</p><br/><p>Siri rode in the wind. She drew a big circle around the fire giant and Rasgrid and Tae Ho kept firing a beginner spear made through the \u2018warrior\u2019s sword\u2019.</p><br/><p>Siri didn\u2019t even have to use her saga. Their target was a giant as tall as 7 meters, so there was no need to aim. It would get on its nerves even if it grazed it!</p><br/><p>\u201cKuaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>And as expected the giant started to get frustrated. Even though it was facing Rasgrid, it turned its head or its eyes and checked Tae Ho\u2019s location. In addition, it even threw some attacks at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho yelled in joy and Rasgrid attacked the opening that was made. Siri flew over a fireball and said with warm eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow wicked.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry?\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri didn\u2019t speak again and Tae Ho aimed at the back of the giant. The giant, that had allowed some attacks from Rasgrid, seemed to have decided do ignore Tae Ho\u2019s attacks that it didn\u2019t even turn back.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a bad response. Because the beginner spears Tae Ho threw towards the giant was so weak it couldn\u2019t even leave a scratch on it.</p><br/><p>However, this was also what Tae Ho wanted. And the reason Siri saved her saga was for this moment.</p><br/><p>[Saga: Sword of the warrior]</p><br/><p>The thing he made was a Heavy Lance.</p><br/><p>[Saga: The arrows of a witch never misses its target]</p><br/><p>The Heavy Lance, that was empowered by the power of a God, drew a sharp trajectory. The fire giant got surprised and turned its body but it was already late. The Heavy Lance struck its ear, and the giant let out a pained roar.</p><br/><p>Right then, the harpies charged towards Tae Ho. Maybe it was because Siri had used her saga that she stumbled for a moment but she passed through the harpies with the help of the \u2018charge of the warrior\u2019. She took a big turn and after turning their heads they saw Rasgrid that was preparing her final attack to deal with the giant that had stumbled because of the blow in its ear.</p><br/><p>\u201cSword that splits the sky!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was just like the name implied. At Rasgrid\u2019s yell, a white aura started to surge to the sky. It became a sword like its name and cut the earth in two.</p><br/><p>The head of the giant was cut in two. Although it wasn\u2019t split, it was enough with that. Fire surged up and the body of the giant got burnt in an instant and fell down like a burnt tree.</p><br/><p>Booooooom-</p><br/><p>A sound similar to a landslide was heard. Rasgrid turned to look at Tae Ho and he could know instinctively.</p><br/><p>Rasgrid smiled. Although he couldn\u2019t see well because she was far away he could know.</p><br/><p>The battle continued. Although new giants didn\u2019t appear, the number of boulders falling from the sky increased. It seemed like they wanted to overturn the situation through sheer numbers.</p><br/><p>However, Valhalla didn\u2019t stay still. Tae Ho just looked at a distant place while fixing his back instead of jumping into the battlefield.</p><br/><p>And then, it started to pour down. The killer thing. The rain of steel that didn\u2019t lose to the flaming boulders!</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>Warriors of Valhalla started to get out of the metal structures when it landed on the ground. And the cheers of the warriors covered the battlefield.</p><br/><p>\u201cOdin!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTir!\u201d</p><br/><p>Strategies didn\u2019t work anymore. It seemed like the giants also realized that, that no more flaming boulders fell from the sky. Tae Ho landed in a safe place far away from the battlefield with Siri and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cCaptain Siri, we can rest now right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri just chanted instead of replying as she was as tired as she could be.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>The battle ended. Corpses of monsters filled the battlefield. It was a complete victory.</p><br/><p>However, the warriors of Valhalla didn\u2019t put their weapons back. Each of them was looking at the center of the battlefield while holding their weapons.</p><br/><p>About 100 warriors.</p><br/><p>Warriors of the Great War were standing on that place. They lost their light and were dimming again as if the promised time with Valhalla was up, but it was different for everyone else on the battlefield. The warriors of the Great War were all starting to shine.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh Valkyrie, lead our souls to Valhalla. We will go to Odin and boast about today\u2019s fight.\u201d</p><br/><p>The warrior at the front said. Rasgrid erased her ice like the expression and smiled gently.</p><br/><p>\u201cExalted warriors, I will make a promise that won\u2019t change for eternity. Valhalla will always welcome you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rasgrid raised her sword. And then Rasgrid\u2019s appearance that was wearing armor changed. Rasgrid swung her sword once more while wearing a dress.</p><br/><p>A path of light opened up. It was a beautiful rainbow path that connected the ground to the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cBifrost\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Originally, the stairs that connected the mortal world Midgard with the world of Gods Asgard.</p><br/><p>The warrior that was looking still at the stair of light put on a nice smile and then raised his voice and yelled.</p><br/><p>\u201cWarriors of Valhalla! Our battle today will remain in history! And remember! Let\u2019s meet again! On a new battlefield!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOn a new battlefield!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOn a new battlefield!\u201d</p><br/><p>The warriors of the Great War yelled, and the warriors of Valhalla took deep breaths. They raised their swords and cheered for the warriors that were leaving.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Asgard and the nine planets.\u201d</p><br/><p>The warrior looked at Rasgrid and said for the last time. And then placed his foot on the stair of light. All of the warriors of the Great War got on the rainbow stair.</p><br/><p>And Rasgrid, that was looking at them, turned her head. She called Tae Ho and Siri with a gesture of her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have done well. The merits you have accomplished are really big.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them had performed better than what she expected. It would be glad about just tying its feet, but to have defeated it.</p><br/><p>She still needed to investigate the flow that occurred afterward, but she could know instinctively. The ones that had made the flow were the two people in front of her.</p><br/><p>\u201cForgive me for having to leave early because I have to lead the warriors. I will return first and prepare a reward according to your merit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rasgrid glanced at the stair of light and said. It seemed like she also had to leave along the warriors.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you. And also here\u2026..We used it well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho gave her the dragon wing clothes that was well folded. Although he really wanted this item, it was correct to give it back as he had borrowed it from her.</p><br/><p>Rasgrid put on a vague smile after receiving the wing coat and then turned to look at Siri and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have done well, Siri. Wasn\u2019t Tae Ho\u2019s flight really violent?\u201d</p><br/><p>At the sympathetical words, Siri grabbed her aching back and nodded. However, Siri regained her usual serious expression and hit her chest as an etiquette and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cI just did my best as a warrior of Valhalla.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rasgrid faced Siri that seemed to have shining eyes and then looked at Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho, Reginleif, and Gandur will come soon. Let the remaining tasks to the two of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although she didn\u2019t say anything else he seemed to know what she meant. She would probably be saying to give them Garmr\u2019s soul fragment, that was the objective of the giants.</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. The two of you have done really well.\u201d</p><br/><p>The warriors of the Great War were already on the shining stairs. Rasgrid placed her lips on Tae Ho\u2019s and Siri\u2019s forehead in turn.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet Odin\u2019s blessing be with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rasgrid\u2019s blessing.</p><br/><p>She smiled and turned back and then got on the shining stairs. She went to Valhalla while leading the warriors.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow beautiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri said in a low voice. Because going to Valhalla while holding the hands of a Valkyrie was the dream of the warriors. Although it was something all the warriors had gone through once, it didn\u2019t mean that the meaning disappeared. It wasn\u2019t only Siri but the warriors of Valhalla also looked at the leaving warriors with feelings of reverence.</p><br/><p>\u2018It is cool indeed.\u2019</p><br/><p>Although Tae Ho had come to Valhalla with different feelings from the warriors, he could only admit the scene in front of him. He felt like a part of him was choking.</p><br/><p>And how much time had passed? It was then that Rasgrid and the warriors reached a high place and the path of light disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cWarrior Tae Ho, warrior Siri.\u201d</p><br/><p>A familiar voice was heard from the sky. They looked up and saw Valkyrie Reginleif and Gandur. Transforming into a beautiful lady from a swan was a really mystical scene.</p><br/><p>Reginleif looked at Siri and Tae Ho gallantly like always and then frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe two of you are really exhausted. I\u2019m sorry but I can\u2019t allow you to rest yet. Can you tell me what happened briefly?\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri glanced at Tae Ho and he started to tell the things that happened in the trace of the Great War. Reginleif, that had listened to everything, carefully put the fragment of Garmr\u2019s soul in a box she took out from the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe merits of the two of you are indeed really big. Rest for now. Let\u2019s listen to the details at a later time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Reginleif spoke rather quickly and but back the chest in the air again and then placed her lips on the both of them just like Rasgrid had done.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet Tir\u2019s blessing be with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>They felt like they were more comfortable in mind and body. Siri trembled as if she enjoyed the blessing and closed her eyes and Tae Ho looked at Gandur that was next to Reginleif.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I wondered if Gandur wouldn\u2019t bless us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although it wasn\u2019t that he wanted to receive a kiss from Gandur, but not receiving was also a bit strange.</p><br/><p>\u2018Collecting\u2026..that\u2019s not it.\u2019</p><br/><p>No, or perhaps it was?</p><br/><p>Gandur smirked at Tae Ho\u2019s words and then shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe greed of humans have no end. But it is indeed right to do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gandur placed her lips on Siri\u2019s forehead that was closer to her and then approached Tae Ho. As Tae Ho closed his eyes while expecting the blessing, Gandur glanced sideways and then placed her lips on Tae Ho\u2019s cheeks.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet Ullr\u2019s blessing be with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although it wasn\u2019t his lips, Tae Ho got surprised because it was an unexpected place. Gandur laughed while looking at that Tae Ho and then turned around and then flew away after transforming into swans.</p><br/><p>Was it only Gandur\u2019s joke?</p><br/><p>Tae Ho touched his cheeks unconsciously and looked at the swans, and Siri that saw that said in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, that was the reason?\u201d</p><br/><p>A joyful voice.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho flinched and looked sideways and then he could realize why Gandur had done that.</p><br/><p>\u201cHi again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although it was similar to what he heard usually, the tone was a bit different.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho made eye contact with Heda that was putting on a smile that seemed fake and then hurriedly lowered his hand from his cheek.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>The giant of strength Harad was caught in an awful mood.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t because the attack had failed. Because he had taken it into account in the first place. And spreading seeds of fire that would become the omen of a big fight was also his objective.</p><br/><p>But the problem lied in another place.</p><br/><p>The giant of night Avalt. He didn\u2019t really think that there would be a seed there as Avalt had just stepped down from the place.</p><br/><p>But there was actually a seed there. In addition, the way it had appeared was close to being the worst.</p><br/><p>But the biggest problem was that Valhalla realized that because of the stupid giant of fire.</p><br/><p>The giants were aiming for Garmr\u2019s soul fragment.</p><br/><p>Valhalla wasn\u2019t a powerless foe. They may have already realized what they were trying to do after gathering the fragments of Garmr\u2019s soul.</p><br/><p>It was a mistake he hadn\u2019t even thought of. He couldn\u2019t even imagine that things would take a turn for the worse like this.</p><br/><p>But that mistake wasn\u2019t the only reason that put the giant of strength Harad in a foul mood.</p><br/><p>Utgard Loki.</p><br/><p>The magician king didn\u2019t say anything about this mistake. He didn\u2019t even punish him nor said any words.</p><br/><p>And that truth put Harad in a terrible pain.</p><br/><p>Would he be thinking that he wasn\u2019t even worthy of being punished? Was he already outside of his eyes? No, perhaps this case by itself wasn\u2019t important at all. Because it was merely a small battle.</p><br/><p>Harad was anxious. And the giant of the night Avalt looked at that Harad from the sides and felt a strange feeling.</p><br/><p>What was the reason?</p><br/><p>Was it because he knew that not punishing him would harass him more?</p><br/><p>The other giants thought like that. But Avalt was different. He thought differently.</p><br/><p>\u2018Perhaps.\u2019</p><br/><p>The magician king would have already foreseen this situation. Harad making a mistake would have been what the magician king had wanted.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt turned out like the king wanted.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though Avalt\u2019s space was the darkness, a small voice passed its ears as if it was whispering. The giant of the night didn\u2019t turn his eyes to check the owner of the voice. It was obvious that the snake-like voice came from Asgard\u2019s giant king, Loki.</p><br/><p>What the king wanted.</p><br/><p>What he was seeking.</p><br/><p>The giant of the night ended his thoughts. And he covered himself with a denser darkness.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t believe in Loki. However, he agreed that it had turned out just like the king had wanted.</p><br/><p>So he would throw away his delusions and perform his duty. Because he was one of the five fingers of the magician king. Accomplishing what the king wanted was also what Avalt himself wanted.</p><br/><p>he would wait for Asgard\u2019s reaction. And then wait for the next order of the magician king.</p><br/><p>The giant of night Avalt decided. He closed his eyes slowly as if being closed in darkness.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, so that happened. You received blessings from Rasgrid, Reginleif and also Gandur.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda stood in between a Black Flash and nodded and said without any emotions.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho, that was lying on a Black Flash, stiffened up. Even if that wasn\u2019t the case, the Black Flash was really like a coffin.</p><br/><p>Siri, that lied down on the Black Flash that was next to him laughed. It seemed like she was really enjoying this situation.</p><br/><p>Heda looked at Tae Ho. He flinched reflexively and Heda laughed once more as if she couldn\u2019t endure it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m joking. Joking.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because she already knew why Gandur had done that in the first place.</p><br/><p>Heda fixed the mattress of Tae Ho and continued saying.</p><br/><p>\u201cKeep resting for now. Siri, you are also exhausted. Do you know how many times you used your saga?\u201d</p><br/><p>The two people had really used their sagas to their limit. Although Tae Ho could somehow endure it because he invested quite a lot of runes on his concentration, it wouldn\u2019t be weird for Siri to collapse at any moment. It wasn\u2019t for nothing that Heda made the two of them lie down on the Black Flash.</p><br/><p>\u201cSiri, thank you a lot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri and Heda exchanged smiles and then Heda spoke again.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are a lot of people to take care of, so you should sleep. Let\u2019s speak about the remaining things at a later time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda spoke up to there and then lowered her posture after approaching Tae Ho. Tae Ho just waited for Heda as he was already accustomed to her blessing.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet Idun\u2019s blessing be with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her voice trembled more than usual.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho opened his eyes quickly but Siri had already turned her body. He saw that she was a little bit embarrassed.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet Idun\u2019s blessing be with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda also blessed Siri and then stood up. Tae Ho just closed his eyes instead of trying to see her face. Maybe it was because of her blessing that he fell asleep in an instant.</p><br/><p>And that was the reason why Tae Ho couldn\u2019t feel it.</p><br/><p>Inside of Unnir.</p><br/><p>The fragment of the unknown weapon was emitting a faint light.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 14 \u2013 Garmr\u2019s soul fragment (1) &gt; End</p><br/>\n</div>"}

As most of them ended in a day or two, compared to the days they had spent in the island of King Sven, you could say that it was comparatively long.</p><br/><p>But it had already been fifteen days since they arrived in Midgard.</p><br/><p>Not only were rumors about the warriors of Valhalla spreading far but people were gathering to see them.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, as it was an opportunity to increase the prestige of the Gods and strengthen the sagas of the warriors. But they couldn\u2019t help but feel uneasy, as the place the Valkyries and the warriors of Valhalla hold is not on Midgard but Asgard.</p><br/><p>King Harpdan invited the warriors to his castle and then served hospitably. As he was someone that was closer to King Catil than King Ivar of Kataron, the synastry between the warriors wasn\u2019t that good but in the first place, the situation was different.</p><br/><p>It seemed like problems in the holy land could also trouble the country of King Harpdan, as he was really earnest in sharing information.</p><br/><p>The first time a change took place was fifteen days before. The people that came and went to the holy land started to get attacked by the beasts. That wasn\u2019t taken too much into account but three days after that, monsters rather than beasts started to attack and the villages near the holy land got destroyed.</p><br/><p>There were also damages in the roads and the farms and King Harpdan couldn\u2019t easily decide if he should enter the holy land to attack.</p><br/><p>There were two reasons for that.</p><br/><p>Firstly, they didn\u2019t know how many monsters there would be and secondly, they were unsure because of the Shinsoos of the earth.</p><br/><p>There were two shinsoos living in the holy land. Based on the legends, they were beasts that were born with an excellent lineage, just like the fine horse of Odin, Sleipnir. They couldn\u2019t only speak in human words but also possessed magical powers.</p><br/><p>The holy land was no different than the land of the shinsoos. King Harpdan didn\u2019t want to clash against the Shinsoos, that were no different to powerful monsters, head on.</p><br/><p>\u2018Could the biggest reason they didn\u2019t fight the rumors about the warriors of Valhalla?\u2019</p><br/><p>Ingrid precisely grasped the third reason King Harpdan didn\u2019t mention. As the warriors of Valhalla had come down to Midgard to get rid of the monsters he had judged that it was far better to ask them to solve this matter.</p><br/><p>Ingrid nodded slowly after listening to all the story. Rasgrid exchanged a glance with Ingrid and then agreed in silence. The one that was leading this expedition was Ingrid so she was the one to take the final decision.</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand. We will enter the place called holy land.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Harpdan smiled satisfactorily and opened up a banquet to welcome the warriors.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, you aren\u2019t going to the banquet?\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha looked at the direction that music was heard from and asked. It had been a long time since the sun had set but the heat of the banquet didn\u2019t seem like it would cool down anytime soon.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho sat on the bed King Harpdan prepared and shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have been there until now. I just returned a bit earlier. I want to rest a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>This morning, the classes with Rasgrid ended. No, more accurately, it had stopped to his advantage. As they reached the destination to accomplish their third task, Tae Ho needed to stay in top shape to prepare for all cases.</p><br/><p>Because of that, Tae Ho wanted to go to sleep for 24 hours as soon as he was freed from Rasgrid in 12 days but the banquet held his feet back. After all, even though it was hard and painful, he couldn\u2019t miss the banquet.</p><br/><p>\u2018That\u2019s a really thorough promotional mentality.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn mumbled as if it was absurd.</p><br/><p>But he couldn\u2019t do anything about that. Because the banquet was the perfect place to patronize something.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut still, you were great on having got out of it in the middle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha also mumbled as if it was absurd but then put on a vague relieved face.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut master, if you sleep the lessons with Scathach will start anyways.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho flinched at Adenmaha\u2019s sharp words and then answered while dripping cold sweat.</p><br/><p>\u201cN, no. There\u2019s no way the divine message of Idun-nim can last for 24 hours. Ugh, but the lessons will still start as soon as I go to sleep right\u2026.?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Why are you asking me when you already know the answer?\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn laughed and said. Adenmaha looked at Tae Ho that had drooped his shoulders and clicked her tongue and then took out Heda\u2019s letter from her pocket.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere, master\u2019s cure all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you. I really only have you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou do know how to speak well.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed like she didn\u2019t dislike that, that she snorted a bit and sat next to Tae Ho and took a peek on the letter. But the contents of the letter were shorter than before.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid something happen to Heda?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s dozing off even in the afternoon, maybe because recharging the summoning rocks every day is harsh on her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, I will have to control myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he was calling Adenmaha everyday, she had to at least recharge one summoning rock everyday. Even if it was the Valkyrie Heda, it was easy for her to get exhausted.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut master, Heda was also worried but how long do you have until you are able to use the power of a God again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout tomorrow in the afternoon, so less than a day.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had defeated Balzak in the afternoon.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m glad as the time passed without much happening.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t drop your guard, it doesn\u2019t finish until it truly finishes.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn said with a harsh voice. Even though he had less than a day left, looking at it by the sides, he still had a day left. Compared to the life and death battles, where each second was precious, it was an eternally long time.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho thought that Cuchulainn\u2019s warning was right and nodded and after that put back Heda\u2019s letter.</p><br/><p>\u201cI should go to sleep. Thanks today too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho showed a smile towards Adenmaha and then took out a summoning rock. And then Adenmaha looked at the summoning rock and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can also charge it with my own magic power so don\u2019t save it and use it whenever you need to. Understand? Don\u2019t get hurt in battle for saving it\u2026..Why is your face like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m thankful that Adenmaha is worrying about me.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Tae Ho put on a smile as if he had seen something warm, Adenmaha frowned and snorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because it\u2019s too troublesome to search for another master. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m worried about master.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a textbook reply.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018You really can\u2019t lie.\u2019</p><br/><p>As Tae Ho and Cuchulainn laughed and spoke, Adenmaha pouted and used the summoning rock Tae Ho was holding to return.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn laughed once again and said to Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u2018Anyways, the restriction time will soon end. Don\u2019t drop your guard and sleep. You have to go meet master.\u2019</p><br/><p>Telling him not to drop his guard but also telling him to go to sleep sounded a bit weird but those weren\u2019t incorrect words. Tae Ho lied on the bed and closed his eyes.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>The night passed and morning came.</p><br/><p>Time flowed along the sun that was getting higher and when the sun was reaching its peak, the one that was looking at the sky took a deep breath.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe sun feels nice today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Spoke a man who was smiling brightly. He was a man that was a head taller than normal people but thought of himself to be small, and the ones around them also thought the same.</p><br/><p>Because the man wasn\u2019t a human but a giant.</p><br/><p>Sinner Sigil. The killer of the same race that had massacred hundreds of his race in the Great War. The crazy bastard that didn\u2019t know his place and tried to stand up to the magician king.</p><br/><p>His hair, that was black and blue like the night, became an ash gray color because of the long prison life. But he didn\u2019t mind that even a little and enjoyed the sunlight.</p><br/><p>And there was someone facing that Sigil with uneasy eyes. He wasn\u2019t a giant but a fomoire. Korga, who was the father of Midak that had died by the hands of Tae Ho and an underling of the Tyrant Bress, was in this place to mediate the negotiation between the giant of earth Balgad and Bress.</p><br/><p>Korga\u2019s task was simple. Support Sigil. Help him do what he wants to do.</p><br/><p>The two people were standing in the middle of the holy lands. And on Sigi\u2019s back, there was a huge hog that used to be called the Shinsoo of Earth. The creature, that had its limbs crushed, was just breathing roughly without even being able to move on the huge magic circle.</p><br/><p>Sigil laughed once again as he spoke,</p><br/><p>\u201cHe was a nice opponent to warm up. I really liked that it was able to take some punches. You said that it was because Garmr\u2019s soul fragment is embedded in it right? What an unfortunate dog bastard, if it wanted to die it should have died peacefully. You are suffering even after having been crushed to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>Garmr\u2019s soul fragment, that resembled a black jewel, was stuck in the forehead of the hog. Sigil turned around and forcefully pulled out the fragment. The hog Shinsoo let out a terrible cry but he didn\u2019t mind that.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you fomoires are also quite something. Having brought me to Midgard without any making any sound was impressive but your information net is also excellent. No, I was surprised in your numbers. Although you are weak fleas, for so many of you to be in Midgard is impressive. Isn\u2019t Bress also hiding in Midgard? There is a saying that the place below the lamp is the darkest.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were words that were spoken as light as a kid but Korga flinched unconsciously. Sigil\u2019s shining eyes made him uneasy.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, what can I do? Let\u2019s speak about business.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sigil smiled thinly. You could only express his smile like that. He turned around to sit down and then moved his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake your underlings and attack the humans city. Balgad\u2019s underlings will also help you. It\u2019s nothing hard. You just have to clash with them head on.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were many that eyed on the great city of Radetza. Because of that, King Harpdan had strong knights under his command to protect the city.</p><br/><p>\u201cVikings are bastards that worry on how they die rather than when, so if you face them head on they will come to greet you. Will they stay still when Valkyries are watching? It should be the same for the warriors of Valhalla. Valhalla is the place where those kinds of Vikings gather. They are the same. A big and flashy battle will occur.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sigi\u2019s eyes were yellow. Korga evaded his eyes that were as long like a cat and asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you also going?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, i\u2019m different. When you clash in the front with a bang, I will enter the city stealthily to massacre the defenseless humans to my heart\u2019s content. It will be fun. I will also be able to accumulate many evil deeds and their force will also disperse.\u201d</p><br/><p>They wouldn\u2019t be able to leave Sigil alone in the city doing what he pleased.</p><br/><p>He had already caught the Shinsoo and acquired Garmr\u2019s soul fragment. However Balgad wanted something beyond that and that was the same for Sigil.</p><br/><p>\u201cI like battling. But I like fighting battles that I can win. I like to kill rather than dying. That\u2019s why I will fight a battle that I can win. I will rip their forces, tear them off and keep tearing them to kill them one by one.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sigil hadn\u2019t prepared only one thing. He turned around to look at the Shinsoo that was groaning in its back.</p><br/><p>\u201cI like Balgad. That bastard is the ring leader that imprisoned me a hundred years ago so I will someday tear him off but I like him right now as he\u2019s the giant of the earth. That\u2019s why I was able to prepare a really fun thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>The magic circle that was covering the Shinsoo wasn\u2019t only to seal its movements. It was a much stronger magic circle that could do something beyond that.</p><br/><p>The place that the magic circle was spread was also peculiar. Sigi,l who had peculiar evil eyes that could see through all things had decided on this place.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe bastards of Valhalla won\u2019t be able to ignore this. No, this is a really big thing. Even if they win against you, that will surely fight moderately, and even if they are somehow able to stop me from going crazy in the city, if they can\u2019t block this then it\u2019s their defeat. So they will only be able to disperse their forces. But that still won\u2019t be able to block it. This is that kind of item.\u201d</p><br/><p>Korga couldn\u2019t ask what it was. He just wanted to get far away from Sigil, who was making him feel uneasy.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, it seemed like Sigil had read the thoughts of that Korga when he stood up from where he was sitting. He looked at the sky and said casually.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTime?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Korga asked unconsciously, Sigil put on a bright smile and turned to look at the hog Shinsoo and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe time for the friend of this guy, that couldn\u2019t finish off its friend that had gone crazy because of Garmr\u2019s soul fragment and that believes that it escaped with its own strength, to run wild against the warriors of Valhalla.\u201d</p><br/><p>A surprise attack wasn\u2019t always the right thing. There was a need to notify the warriors of Valhalla about the factor that would make them feel nervous and that will disperse their forces.</p><br/><p>Sigil took a deep breath. He closed his eyes and opened them again.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet ready to attack. Don\u2019t waste any more time and go. It\u2019s now the time to fight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sigil didn\u2019t wait for Korga\u2019s answer and walked away. Korga could only follow him back.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>A Shinsoo that had the shape of a black cow ran. When it reached the city of Radetza despite being a bloody mess, the sound of a horn trumpet that notified the attack of an enemy was heard.</p><br/><p>The Shinsoo fell in front of Ingrid and started to tell her about the things it had seen.</p><br/><p>The warriors of Radetza, that had become inspired by the warriors of Valhalla, didn\u2019t even wait for the orders of the king and went to the front lines. Hundreds and thousands of fomoires were charging towards the castle.</p><br/><p>Rasgrid took some of the warriors of Valhalla and went to the front lines. Valkyrie Ingrid didn\u2019t listen to the words of the Shinsoo half heartedly. She groaned when she heard that the giant who had suppressed the hog Shinsoo was planning something big in the holy lands.</p><br/><p>They also had to deploy warriors to the holy land. As they had the flying pirate ship that had finished repairing itself, they would be able to fly over the front lines and go to the holy lands.</p><br/><p>Ingrid selected the warriors that would go to the holy land. She got on the flying ship first to lead the warriors.</p><br/><p>The flying ship started to fly.</p><br/><p>The warriors of Radetza looked at the fomoires that were flocking over and blew their horn trumpets.</p><br/><p>King Harpdan didn\u2019t go out to battle. Korga just looked at the battlefield while standing on the rear so that he could escape at any time but Rasgrid noticed the existence of Korga, who was standing on the back lines.</p><br/><p>While all of that was happening.</p><br/><p>The soldiers that were guarding the gates of Radetza urged on the ones that had escaped. As the front lines of the battle and Radetza weren\u2019t that far away they had to close the gates.</p><br/><p>One in the group that entered the gates hurriedly looked behind towards his back. He heard the sound of a horn trumpet being heard from far away and looked at the flying ship flying on the sky.</p><br/><p>He smiled brightly and turned around once again to walk deeper into the city.</p><br/><p>While the battle against the knights of Radetza and the fomoires started, Sigil, the killer of the same race, crossed the gates.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 24 \u2013 The Shinsoo\u2019s of Earth (3) &gt; End</p><hr/><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/>\n</div>"}

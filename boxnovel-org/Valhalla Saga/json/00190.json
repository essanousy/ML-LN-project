It\u2019s because the middle head of the nine has an immortal strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Hydra that had nine heads was feared even by the Gods because of its strong poison but it also possessed other frightening powers that was its regenerative power that was close to unlimited.</p><br/><p>The middle head of the Hydra had immortality that didn\u2019t die no matter what you did. In addition, the remaining eight heads regrew when they got cut so it was like an impregnable fortress.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why Heracles placed it in a swamp and sealed it after covering it with a huge mountain.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho reviewed the explanation he heard from Athena and looked at the swamp of Lerna that was below the cliff he was at. There was indeed a mountain of boulders piling up from deep in the swamp.</p><br/><p>[Sealed]</p><br/><p>[Hydra]</p><br/><p>He saw red words below the mountain as he looked with the \u2018eyes of the dragon\u2019. He could feel the grief and resentment even from the words perhaps because it got sealed away for hundreds years while it was alive.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will rescue you soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho spoke in a low voice and then checked the state of the ones that accompanied him.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha, Nidhogg, Rolo, Drakon Ismenios, Siri and Bracky.</p><br/><p>The other six excluding Nidhogg, that was resistant to poison as she was a poison dragon in the first place, had prepared towards the poison thoroughly.</p><br/><p>But Tae Ho didn\u2019t relax with just that and also engraved one rune in each of their bodies. They were the runes Odin engraved in him when he went to save Nidhogg and protected the owner from poison.</p><br/><p>\u2018Did you learn it as you became the successor of Odin?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes, Odin-nim is also the God of magic.\u2019</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t receive all of Odin\u2019s vast knowledge but he could still learn several strong magic. The reason he was able to call thunder and lightning, that represented Thor, when fighting against Ares was because his control over the runes got greatly strengthened.</p><br/><p>When Tae Ho finished engraving the runes on them he turned to look at every one of them and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will start now. You all remember the strategy, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I will do it clearly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg, that was the most motivated in the group, clenched her fists and spoke. Even so she had been given a quite important role.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, let\u2019s start then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho clapped and then turned towards the swamp of Lerna.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>The Hydra, that was sealed in the deepest place of the swamp of Lerna, didn\u2019t have any thoughts.</p><br/><p>In the early stages when she got trapped, she struggled to escape and even worked hard to maintain her consciousness but she gave up everything when 10 years passed.</p><br/><p>What she could think of while being pressed down by a heavy mountain of rocks wasn\u2019t freedom but pain.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why the Hydra didn\u2019t think anything. It worked hard to not do so.</p><br/><p>Hundreds of years like that.</p><br/><p>Hydra woke up from its deep slumber. It was because it felt someone approaching it.</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t fools that got lost and entered the swamp. The ones that did get lost would get surprised at the poison and turn around in the entrance.</p><br/><p>The ones that were approaching had entered quite deeply. If Hydra\u2019s senses hadn\u2019t been dulled they weren\u2019t that far from the mountain. In addition the distance was still being closed.</p><br/><p>Hydra gulped dry saliva once again. It felt its heart beat for the first time in hundreds of years.</p><br/><p>Who was coming?</p><br/><p>Why?</p><br/><p>\u2018No, let\u2019s not make any expectations. You can\u2019t.\u2019</p><br/><p>In the first place, you would get disappointed if you had some expectations. It didn\u2019t know who had come but it wasn\u2019t probable that they had come to rescue it as it was a terrible monster.</p><br/><p>Hydra consoled itself and tried to fall in a deep sleep again. But it couldn\u2019t stop its heart from beating. It couldn\u2019t stop itself from feeling like a fool while waiting for something.</p><br/><p>\u2018They are coming. They are getting closer.\u2019</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t only one person. There were several of them. In addition they reached right in front of the mountain.</p><br/><p>What were they trying to do? Why had they come to this place?</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t important. Hydra just focused on one thing.</p><br/><p>If they had come to clean away the mountain. If they had freed it from its seal whether they had come to kill it.</p><br/><p>It wouldn\u2019t miss the opportunity. It would fly high away and escape from this hell.</p><br/><p>\u2018And just in case, if just in case.\u2019</p><br/><p>They came to rescue Hydra.</p><br/><p>There was no one in this world that would do that but if they really did.</p><br/><p>It should repay to them. Do everything it can to pay them back.</p><br/><p>In the first place, Hydra wasn\u2019t such an evil monster. Compared to the Gods of Olympus that were famous to be nasty, it was rather good. It was also worried that the poison that spread out from it would affect its surroundings.</p><br/><p>Hydra gulped dry saliva once again and concentrated on what was happening above it.</p><br/><p>The mountain was moving.</p><br/><p>At first, it moved really faintly but then started to be moved greatly.</p><br/><p>The mountain was collapsing. The mountain that was pressing down on it for a hundred years disappeared.</p><br/><p>Its breathing got rough by its own. It felt like its chest would burst out at the unrealistic dream.</p><br/><p>And at some point.</p><br/><p>The weight of the mountain pressing down on it became a tenth. If it was this much weight it could stand up by its own strength.</p><br/><p>Hydra sobbed. It roared and struggled and tried to obtain freedom by surging up.</p><br/><p>But it was at that moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk-!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hydra let out a breathtaking sound. It was because the moment it stood up something bigger than the mountain had pressed down on it.</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho master! Am I doing well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, you are! Just keep pressing it down!\u201d</p><br/><p>The huge black dragon that was a hundred meters big.</p><br/><p>The hydra was also huge but it was only 30 meters long from head to tail. It\u2019s body structure was closer to a snake so it couldn\u2019t be compared to Nidhogg at all.</p><br/><p>Hydra struggled to see who was the one pressing down on it but it couldn\u2019t even move. It unavoidably tried to at least see in front of it.</p><br/><p>And then took a breath again. It got dispirited at the beings looking down at it.</p><br/><p>First, there was a huge and white dragon. It was releasing white frost from its mouth and its violet eyes were really scary.</p><br/><p>Next to it was an atrocious looking red dragon. Everything it breathed flames came out from its mouth and its eyes were so yellow it thought it had a barbaric temperament.</p><br/><p>There was a golden dragon next to it once again. The red dragon was already atrocious but this golden dragon was even more so. It was even glaring at it compared to the two dragons next to it so it was more scary.</p><br/><p>The ones that moved the mountain.</p><br/><p>It was them. The three dragons had moved the mountain.</p><br/><p>But it didn\u2019t seem like it was to save itself.</p><br/><p>\u201cLovely and respectful master, its eyes are too rebellious. It seems like we have to hit it first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t do anything about it. They say it has been trapped for hundreds of years.\u201d</p><br/><p>The golden dragon said some absurd words filled with misunderstandings. The Hydra hurriedly rolled its eyes to find the one it called as master. There was a man standing proudly in front of the white dragon. It could feel a really strong power from him as he was being surrounded with his dark blue divinity.</p><br/><p>\u2018No! It\u2019s a misunderstanding! I\u2019m not rebellious at all!\u2019</p><br/><p>Hydra yelled hurriedly but the only thing that came out from its mouth were roars.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, let\u2019s start immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment the man said that the dragons started to move. The unknown existence that was pressing down on it pressed on its heads and the two people that were next to the man raised their big swords and approached it.</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t tell me.\u2019</p><br/><p>The man opened his mouth again when Hydra was covered in fear.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt will get exhausted at one point as its unlimited regenerative power isn\u2019t really unlimited. It should also be quite exhausted already.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo the first thing I will do after becoming a God is slashing heads\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a normal snake. In addition it has unlimited regenerative power. How fun.\u201d</p><br/><p>The big man and the woman next to him approached it while saying some terrible things.</p><br/><p>\u2018No! Wait! Let\u2019s speak with words!\u2019</p><br/><p>Hydra yelled once again but only atrocious sounds came out. Unfortunately, it seemed like no one could understand what it was saying.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m starting!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment the big man yelled thunder flashed and then the eight heads started to get cut off mercilessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow! It\u2019s really regenerating!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play and cut them down quickly!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Kuaaak!\u2019</p><br/><p>Hydra yelled out mentally. The heads that regenerated got cut down again. It tried to struggle the moment they regenerated but it was pointless.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s mobility was greatly restricted because of some existence pressing down on it and in addition the three dragons stepped on the heads that regenerated and didn\u2019t let it move.</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho master, it looks like it\u2019s really hurt.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t do anything about it. The ones that got trapped for a long time will get hatred accumulated in them. At first they say that they should pay back to the ones that rescued them but when more time passes their resentment grows bigger and tries to kill everyone without exception. The situation is really different with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPoor\u2026\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>When the man spoke with a really regretful voice the one that was on top of Hydra said in a depressed way.</p><br/><p>And Hydra was about to get crazy at their conversation.</p><br/><p>\u2018I still didn\u2019t reach that point! I stopped thinking before I got there!\u2019</p><br/><p>But it didn\u2019t reach them either. The killing intent that didn\u2019t exist before was about to appear as its head got cut down dozens of times.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, look that. Those evil eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, I think that it\u2019s clearly dangerous.\u201d</p><br/><p>The white dragon and the golden dragon said.</p><br/><p>Hydra was only grateful towards the red dragon that just did what it had to do with a non interested face.</p><br/><p>And after getting cut down a few more times.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s body was already weakened as it had been trapped for a long time. Even if it did regenerate its heads, they only drooped. It felt like its eyes were closing on its own.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think we can stop cutting them down.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d</p><br/><p>The big man said and the woman that had a tail and wolf ears agreed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Did it finally end\u2026..\u2019</p><br/><p>Hydra raised her eyes forcefully and looked at the man approaching it. Tae Ho observed it for a moment and then surged up and got on its head.</p><br/><p>[Saga: The one that conquers dragons]</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t feel the urge to resist at all as it got its heads cut off for close to a hundred times. It rather flowed a voice telling them to do whatever they wanted with it.</p><br/><p>\u2018Certainly, the capture rate is higher after you beat it a bit and take away its strength.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho thought of the monster gathering game that he enjoyed while he was a pro gamer and then concentrated on his saga again.</p><br/><p>Hydra was a being that wanted to maintain the world just like Athena had said. Thanks to that, Tae Ho didn\u2019t special measures like he did with Drakon Ismenios.</p><br/><p>But even so, he didn\u2019t retrieve the \u2018one that conquers dragons\u2019. It was because he had another objective he wanted after capturing Hydra.</p><br/><p>The mother of Hydra.</p><br/><p>The mother of all monsters.</p><br/><p>Hydra\u2019s father, Typhon, was a being wanting to destroy the world but its mother was a being wanting to maintain the world.</p><br/><p>If you used a reference from Asgard it was like the God of fire and lies Loki and his wife Angrboda.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho also wanted to know of Echidna.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t only because the mother of countless monsters was also of the dragon race.</p><br/><p>The voice that changed the 12 Olympians into beings that wanted to destroy the world.</p><br/><p>Apollo estimated the voice to belong to the Titan Chronos but Hades had said that it wasn\u2019t the case.</p><br/><p>He said that it wasn\u2019t something Chronos could do as he got chased away from the seat of king of Gods.</p><br/><p>Then who?</p><br/><p>Who changed the 12 Olympians?</p><br/><p>Tae Ho didn\u2019t miss the main point. He was in a situation where he had to face Zeus and the 12 Olympians that had turned but the real enemy was the owner of the voice. He had to find who that was first.</p><br/><p>\u2018If the Gods don\u2019t know, gather information from the monsters.\u2019</p><br/><p>You could say that Echidna, that was the starting point of countless monsters, was the God of monsters. She was a strange existence that was a being that wanted to maintain the world and had a close relationship with her children that were beings that wanted to destroy the world.</p><br/><p>He would obtain information about the owner of the voice from her. And even if he can\u2019t, she would be of a bigger help than Hydra as she was of a strong dragon race.</p><br/><p>The place the mother of monsters Echidna was hiding at.</p><br/><p>Hydra\u2019s memories answered to Tae Ho\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 56 \u2013 Starting point (1) &gt; End</p><br/><p>VS Episode 56 Chapter 2</p><br/><p>Episode 56/Chapter 2: Starting Point (2)</p><br/><p>TL: Tsubak</p><br/><p>ED:</p><br/><p>Tae Ho opened his eyes slowly and removed \u2018the one that conquers dragons\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u2018So, do you know where that is?\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn asked with an uneasy tone. It was because the information Tae Ho obtained through \u2018the one that conquers dragons\u2019 was only transmitted to him so Cuchulainn had no ways to know what he got.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho smirked and said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes, it remembers the place quite clearly. I was worried that they moved places because it happened too long ago but I don\u2019t really think they moved after looking at the location.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho explained about the dwelling place of Echidna. She was living in a city underground that she made herself and was filled with the monsters she gave birth to.</p><br/><p>The place was so big and there were many monsters living in it so they didn\u2019t even think of moving places.</p><br/><p>\u2018That\u2019s fortunate.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn let out a short sigh of relief. He acted too playfully usually but he worried about the group a lot.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut master, is he really a male? It looks like its a female after looking at it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The voice of Adenmaha interrupted them while the two of them were speaking. She had asked too naturally so Tae Ho was about to answer her but fortunately he was able to shut his mouth before answering.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Uh\u2026.I wonder. I don\u2019t know well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha\u2019s eyes sharpened at Tae Ho\u2019s answer and Cuchulainn clicked his tongue.</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know my ass. Did you change your eyes of the dragon with candy?\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn was the master of insight. No, at this point anyone could realize it no matter how dull they were.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho spoke with an unfair voice.</p><br/><p>\u2018No, actually it\u2019s not important if Hydra is a male or a female. But if I say that its a female everyone looks at me as if i\u2019m a bad guy\u2026..this is all for the peace of the family\u2026..no, for the residence.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s important only because it\u2019s you.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn summarized Tae Ho\u2019s complains and clicked his tongue. He then looked at Hydra.</p><br/><p>\u2018But is it because the two of them are dragons? I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s a female no matter how much I look at her.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know either.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I can\u2019t trust you.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster?\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha, that couldn\u2019t listen to Tae Ho\u2019s excuse compared to Cuchulainn, asked in a low voice again.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho got surprised and changed the subject again.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad it\u2019s calm anyways. ALthough it may be because it\u2019s completely tired.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though he had released \u2018the one that conquers dragons\u2019 Hydra didn\u2019t show any resistance. It just flinched at times while laying down.</p><br/><p>\u2018It looks like fish that you took out from the water. Tch tch. How did you get caught by this bastard?\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho shook his head as Cuchulainn spoke with a tone that it was a poor creature.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ey, didn\u2019t it get to escape thanks to me?\u2019</p><br/><p>If Tae Ho hadn\u2019t come then it would still be buried under the mountain.</p><br/><p>\u2018That\u2019s right but I don\u2019t want to admit it\u2019</p><br/><p>Just looking at the results it was indeed rescuing but the process was really cruel. In the end, they hadn\u2019t just freed it. They had locked it up with a leash so that they could use it in the future.</p><br/><p>\u2018Does everyone become evil after they become Gods? No, you were already evil.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn spoke alone wanting Tae Ho to hear him but Tae Ho just ignored him like usual. He rather showed interest towards Nidhogg that was looking at him for some time now.</p><br/><p>\u201cNidhogg? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg paused for a moment at Tae Ho\u2019s question and then tilted her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho master, can\u2019t he transform into a person?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026.probably not?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPoor\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg was about to cry at any moment now. She kept feeling bad for Hydra perhaps because of the sympathy she had towards it.</p><br/><p>But it was rather glad for Tae Ho. His good lie would have been exposed if it transformed.</p><br/><p>But it was at that moment.</p><br/><p>\u2018You can just transform her. With your rune magic.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Oh, that\u2019s right. There\u2019s certainly magic like that after looking for it.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn got bewildered at Tae Ho\u2019s answer.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hey, what do you mean that you looked for it? You still haven\u2019t learned it completely?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018There\u2019s too many new magic I learned. What do I say? It\u2019s like a book entered my mind as I didn\u2019t learn it naturally?\u2019</p><br/><p>The only thing Tae Ho received from Odin wasn\u2019t the seat of the master.</p><br/><p>Odin had transmitted Tae Ho the countless magic and knowledge he obtained as the God of magic and wisdom in the shape of a book.</p><br/><p>Actually, he hadn\u2019t prepared all of this for Tae Ho. It was prepared for his son Valdur, that he had picked as his successor before him.</p><br/><p>But Valdur died in the Great War and Odin chose Tae Ho as his other successor.</p><br/><p>So whatever the case, Tae Ho was Odin\u2019s real successor.</p><br/><p>\u2018So anyways, you are saying that you can do it.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I can.\u2019</p><br/><p>Only that he didn\u2019t want to.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho looked at Adenmaha and Nidhogg in turn. He was bothered at Adenmaha\u2019s eyes getting more similar to Heda or Idun-nim but it was also hard to ignore Nidhogg\u2019s earnest eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, we will know for certain after it transforms. Nidhogg, master will transform it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha spoke with a hard tone. It seemed like she realized that Tae Ho could do it but was hesitating.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? Tae Ho master is great!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg jumped in place in happiness. It seemed like it was too late to pull back looking at her.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tch tch, this is all because of your doings.\u2019</p><br/><p>While Cuchulainn snickered and showed a weird talent for putting a solemn voice, Tae Ho resoluted himself.</p><br/><p>\u2018Right, who cares if Hydra is a male or a female?\u2019</p><br/><p>The only thing that matters is that it fights well.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho started to draw rune magic in the air. It was a strong magic that made the adversary change by using their soul as a reference.</p><br/><p>As Tae Ho added runes in the air without stopping, Adenmaha let out an admiring voice. It was because the proficiency Tae Ho had in magic wasn\u2019t normal.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t seem lacking even if he was compared to Adenmaha, that had received harsh training under Scathach.</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho master is cool.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg\u2019s eyes also shone as she also started to learn mystical magic under Scathach although only the basics.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho got in a good mood and finished the magic without saving magic power at all. When he retrieved his finger after drawing the last rune, ten runes took place in Hydra\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u201cTransform.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he recited the short chant, light started to emanate from Hydra\u2019s body. And then, the 30 meter long body started to shrink down in an instant.</p><br/><p>\u2018Oh, this is also good as its fresh.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn was expecting a slim beauty but still let out a sigh of admiration instead of disappointment.</p><br/><p>Hydra transformed into a girl that had long green hair. Just by looking at her looks she looked to be about 12 years old.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg admired and Adenmaha let out a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>Siri and Bracky got bewildered as the monster they had been cutting the head of became a girl.</p><br/><p>And Hydra blinked a few times and looked at her body as she got exposed to the gazes of everyone. She touched her neck with her long and slender fingers and let out a voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><br/><p>The voice of a person came out. She became able to freely manifest words thanks to Tae Ho having added a rune that translated voices.</p><br/><p>What will she say first?</p><br/><p>Hydra opened her mouth once again while everyone was looking at her. She burst in tears and yelled.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! You bad bastard!\u201d</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>\u201cHuaaang! I, I wanted to pay you back\u2026but you cut down my head mercilessly! I still haven\u2019t become evil! I didn\u2019t reach to that point yet!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hydra cried sorrowfully in Nidhogg\u2019s embrace. Nidhogg held her more tightly and also started to cry.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho decided to just leave them be. Rather than ignoring them it was a kind of solution. She had to release all her pent up emotions as she had been trapped for more than a hundred years so she didn\u2019t have any settlements.</p><br/><p>\u2018I feel like you are distorting the reason she\u2019s crying.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho ignored Cuchulainn\u2019s inquiry and then he cleared his throat to calm down the situation and started to speak. It wasn\u2019t to ignore the sharp gaze of Adenmaha at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe location of Echidna is just like I told you. We will have to know if it\u2019s a place we can go with Hermes\u2019 magic circle but we may be able to go there as it\u2019s not the territory of the ones wanting to destroy the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, but it will still be good to use the magic circle if possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDrakon Ismenios, can you tell us about Echidna?\u201d</p><br/><p>Followed by Bracky, Siri looked at Ismenios and said. It was because he was the only one in the group to be considered a native.</p><br/><p>Drakon Ismenios turned to look at Tae Ho before answering. Tae Ho nodded at his eyes asking for permission and then started to explain.</p><br/><p>\u201cEchidna is a being that is called as the mother of all monsters. You can say that she\u2019s a God for the monsters.\u201d</p><br/><p>They already knew this. That\u2019s why Bracky asked a different thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere should be many famous monsters among her children, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. Even the siblings of Hydra are amazing. The Nemean Lion, Chimera, Orthrus, Cerberus are all children of Echidna.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCerberus is the big dog we saw at the entrance of the underworld?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, she bore to many more children aside of them. Actually, if you climb the genealogy tree of the famous monsters all of them have Echidna\u2019s blood flowing in them be it small or large.\u201d</p><br/><p>Actually, Echidna didn\u2019t only have many children. She has had relationships with several men to have diverse children.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe most famous one for being Echidna\u2019s husband is Typhon. He\u2019s an overwhelming monster that has even defeated Zeus-nim once.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs he alive?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bracky\u2019s eyes shone and asked. It was because he would certainly be of great help if it was a monster that had defeated Zeus once.</p><br/><p>But Drakon Ismenios smiled bitterly and shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is but he\u2019s in a state that\u2019s no different from being dead. Zeus-nim pressed him down with a big mountain and sealed him up but he became one with that mountain and became a volcano. It\u2019s a bad tempered volcano that erupts a few times in a year.\u201d</p><br/><p>In addition, Typhon was born as a being wanting to destroy the world. He wouldn\u2019t be able to side with them.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about the other husbands?\u201d</p><br/><p>Drakon Ismenios spread his fingers at Adenmaha\u2019s question and then smirked.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe also had many children with the Great hero Heracles. It seemed like Echidna asked that as compensation because Heracles killed many of her children including the Nemean Lion. There\u2019s a saying that she stole Heracles\u2019 horse and returned it back\u2026..But anyways, she had three children with Heracles. I think that it\u2019s because of his blood that they aren\u2019t monsters but humans.\u201d</p><br/><p>If you briefed it up, Heracles had let her bare his children in compensation for having killed her children.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha blinked at the absurd explanation and even Bracky and Siri couldn\u2019t hide their bewilderment.</p><br/><p>\u2018What do I say. The more I listen from this place the more absurd it feels.\u2019</p><br/><p>When Tae Ho mumbled in a low voice Cuchulainn smiled bitterly and said.</p><br/><p>\u2018There are more similar stories in Olympus. That\u2019s why it would be good for you to get accustomed to it.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn made an advice that was of help aside of battles in a long time.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho nodded a few times and looked at Nidhogg and the Hydra. It seemed like the two of them were exhausted of crying that they were sleeping while embracing each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s return for now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho said and everyone agreed.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>The group recovered their fatigue after they returned and waited for Hermes.</p><br/><p>When Hermes arrived late in the night he told one good news and one bad news to the group. The bad one was that he still hasn\u2019t found out about Demeter\u2019s and Hephaestus\u2019 whereabouts and the good one was that he could create the magic circle leading to the entrance of Echidna\u2019s lair.</p><br/><p>The next morning, the group woke up early in the morning and moved through the transference magic circle like when they left to capture Hydra.</p><br/><p>What changed this time was that the three Valkyries and the Hydra was added to the group.</p><br/><p>Echidna\u2019s lair wasn\u2019t that far away from Typhon\u2019s volcano. It was a place that was filled with ashes thanks to the volcano trying to erupt at all times.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe crack over there is the entrance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hydra pointed at the distant place and said. You could feel hesitation in her voice rather than grief.</p><br/><p>\u201cHydra, aren\u2019t you happy? You are returning home.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Nidhogg embraced Hydra from behind and asked Hydra answered with a depressed voice once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been so long\u2026.and mother doesn\u2019t mind about her children after they independize. That\u2019s why she didn\u2019t come to save me\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no way Echidna didn\u2019t know what had happened to Hydra, where she was trapped.</p><br/><p>But regardless of that, she just left her be and didn\u2019t come to her rescue. Was that all? She even had children with Heracles that had killed her brother, the Nemean Lion.</p><br/><p>Her mother Echidna had thrown her away. She didn\u2019t come to her rescue even though she had been trapped for a hundred years. Hydra was a thrown child.</p><br/><p>Hydra\u2019s eyes reddened but compared to usual Nidhogg was at her side.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. If something similar happens Tae Ho master and I will rescue you. I promise.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg smiled brightly and raised her pinky finger. She was making a promise just like she had learned from Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>Hydra hesitated for a moment but then also raised her pinky and crossed it with Nidhogg\u2019s finger. After they made a stamp with their thumbs, Nidhogg smiled brightly again and in the end Hydra also smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes. You can call me unnie. Call me unnie. I want to be called unnie.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hydra opened her eyes roundly at Nidhogg\u2019s words that was filled with eagerness and then giggled.</p><br/><p>\u2018How warm. To harass that nice kid. You are really a bad guy. I realized it since you first met Nidhogg.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes, I should just die.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho admitted it cleanly and then moved to the crack first. When he approached it he noticed that it was 10 meters big and the length was so long that even dragons could easily enter it.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho, Adenmaha and Rasgrid made light with their mystical magic or runes and brightened up their surroundings. When they got down a few hundred meters like rock-climbing they saw a really big place appear.</p><br/><p>\u2018Indeed, the underground city.\u2019</p><br/><p>There were shiny rocks stuck in the ceiling and it made it resemble the sky at night. It wasn\u2019t as bright as the afternoon but you could plentily live under it.</p><br/><p>\u2018It connects quite deeply inside.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho said after looking with his \u2018eyes of the dragon\u2019.</p><br/><p>And after that.</p><br/><p>He saw red words appear. All of them were monsters and more than half of them were of the dragon race.</p><br/><p>As their surroundings got filled with monsters, Tae Ho\u2019s group put nervous expressions and took on battle stances.</p><br/><p>Gandur asked Hydra.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you look at it they are all your siblings. Can\u2019t you do something?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible. It\u2019s the first time I see any of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was obvious as it had already been more than a hundred years since Hydra left Echidna\u2019s lair.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho looked at a distant place once again with his \u2018eyes of the dragon\u2019. Someone that possessed strength that was incomparable to Hydra was observing them.</p><br/><p>The mother of monsters Echidna.</p><br/><p>She was an existence that could be called as a dragon God just like Nidhogg. The dragons that appeared now were all Echidna\u2019s children and her heroes.</p><br/><p>The heroes of Olympus were all under the subordination of the Gods they served and it wasn\u2019t different for Echidna\u2019s children. They were subordinates of Echidna differently from Hydra that had independize herself.</p><br/><p>[If you want to meet me come here.]</p><br/><p>[I will be waiting for you.]</p><br/><p>The bewitching voice of a woman rang in his head. It was the same method Apollo used with the voices of the Gods.</p><br/><p>Echidna\u2019s children started to release their sharp auras and started to grown. When they started to stand up one by one to block the path of the group their number reached a dozen.</p><br/><p>The monsters were quite diverse. And more than a half were strong dragons.</p><br/><p>Even if you were a strong hero you could only get nervous in this situation but Tae Ho showed interest instead of fear.</p><br/><p>He even smiled in front of the battle like a warrior of Valhalla.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt least one thing is certain.\u201d</p><br/><p>If he gained control over Echidna he would get an army of dozens of dragons.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a grand sight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bracky also smirked and said. Cuchulainn and SIri agreed to his words.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, don\u2019t we have to gain control over her first and then speak?\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha spoke in a low voice and Tae Ho nodded. Adenmaha was always right just like Heda.</p><br/><p>\u2018They are coming.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn said. The monsters roared to the point the cave shook and then charged towards the group.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho looked at them and surged up his dark blue divinity. He charged forward instead of falling back and activated his saga.</p><br/><p>[Hall of Valhalla.]</p><br/><p>This land would become Asgard\u2019s from now on.</p><br/><p>The dark blue divinity of the God of conquer spread in the cave.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 56 \u2013 Starting point (2) &gt; End</p><br/>\n</div>"}

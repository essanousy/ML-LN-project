Although it was short when compared to their life spans, it wasn\u2019t so for the collective races.</p><br/><p>As time flowed fairly for both humans and Gods, the Gods also felt the time flowing slowly.</p><br/><p>A hundred years.</p><br/><p>A period of more than thirty thousand years.</p><br/><p>In that time, the Gods of Asgard and the giants of Jotunheim stood at the boundaries of the destroyed Erin and Asgard and glared at each other.</p><br/><p>The battle hadn\u2019t ended. There had been no big battles that would break the balance of the scale, but the small battles kept occurring repeatedly.</p><br/><p>Because of that, the giants now showing some movements at the front lines wasn\u2019t that big of a deal. The frost giants had always moved troops tens of times a year and provoked Asgard continuously.</p><br/><p>But it was a bit different this time.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t only because Garmr\u2019s soul fragments appeared in a bunch.</p><br/><p>The God of Thunder, Thor, stood on the walls of the front lines and glared at the giants, and a grand sound that wasn\u2019t inferior to rumbling thunder echoed out.</p><br/><p>Thor knew his voice.</p><br/><p>The God of Hunting, Ullr, who stood beside Thor, had also heard his voice a long time ago.</p><br/><p>The God of Messages, Hermod, rode on the wind. He was riding towards the direction the sound was heard with the eight-legged horse, Sleipnir.</p><br/><p>Hermod remembered the day he\u2019d first heard that sound. That day was an unforgettable one.</p><br/><p>A hundred years ago.</p><br/><p>The day the fire of Muspelheim\u2019s king, Surtr, burned down Erin.</p><br/><p>The day the Great War started.</p><br/><p>The sound of the horn trumpet shook heaven and earth, and it grew even louder as it neared Valhalla.</p><br/><p>Hermod looked behind him. Thanks to the speed of Sleipnir, faster than the wind, the walls of the front lines were soon at a great distance.</p><br/><p>However, Hermod had eyes that could see thousands of miles away, and he could clearly see the unfolding events at the walls as if they were right before him.</p><br/><p>The warriors were moving. They were taking their weapons and forming ranks upon the walls. The Valkyries urged those warriors and raised the flags of their legions.</p><br/><p>It was a scene that made one\u2019s chest burn, a really trustworthy sight.</p><br/><p>However, Hermod gulped dry saliva unconsciously. He forcefully turned his eyes away from the walls as it was hard to see it even with his eyes that could gaze a thousand miles away.</p><br/><p>Uneasiness was sprouting from a part of his chest, and this was something he had already been through once.</p><br/><p>\u2018The Great War.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hermod didn\u2019t think anymore. His eyes were looking toward Valhalla.</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>A huge fortress existed on top of the rainbow-like Bifrost that connected Asgard and Midgard.</p><br/><p>The protector God that guarded the strong fortress, that was able to easily block tens of thousands of enemies, was Heimdall.</p><br/><p>He heard the sound of the horn trumpet from Valhalla.</p><br/><p>He, who could even hear the fur of sheeps growing, could know more clearly than anyone where the sound came from and who had blown the horn trumpet.</p><br/><p>It was the King of Gods, Odin.</p><br/><p>He was blowing the horn trumpet in the lake of Mimir that was connected with a root of the world tree Yggdrasil, and was climbing up.</p><br/><p>Heimdall closed his ears for a moment and looked in front of him. The Valkyries were gathering, and the warriors of Heimdall\u2019s legion were hurriedly running to several places of the fortress.</p><br/><p>The front lines of Asgard weren\u2019t the only places that a problem had occurred.</p><br/><p>There were also changes occurring in Midgard. Even though they had killed Bress, King of the fomoires, with a great surprise attack and cleaned up their remains, giants were still appearing in several places of Midgard.</p><br/><p>The representative Valkyrie of Heimdall\u2019s legion, Herpiortr, hit her chest twice and expressed etiquette. She, who had red hair like flames and was the owner of the legion, looked at her master\u2019s eyes Heimdall fixedly.</p><br/><p>Heimdall nodded to her. He just hit his chest twice instead of saying anything and then went towards the highest place of Bifrost.</p><br/><p>The King of Gods, Odin, blew the horn trumpet and transmitted his will, and it then became the turn of Heimdall to make the final declaration.</p><br/><p>To use the horn trumpet of war, Gjallarhorn\u2026. They\u2019d hoped they wouldn\u2019t ever use it again but knew they\u2019d inevitably have to one day.</p><br/><p>Heimdall blew Gjallarhorn.</p><br/><p>He notified Asgard and the other realms that the Great War had restarted.</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>Helga raised her head. She, the princess of Kataron, brave shieldmaiden, and a loyal believer of Idun, started to drip cold sweat from her forehead. Her black hair that was always brushed prettily was now disheveled and being shaken by the wind.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>She answered at the voice mixed with worry that was heard from next to her and looked at the sky. She thought she had heard the sound of a horn trumpet, but it seemed like it was an illusion.</p><br/><p>She was now riding on a horse, and the shield maidens and warriors that were riding next to her were the elites of Kataron. They, who had participated on the subjugation of the evil fomoires following the warrior of Idun, were now hurriedly returning to the castle of Kataron.</p><br/><p>Originally, it had to be an enjoyable trip. Helga had set up quite a lot of military exploits in the expeditions she had been together with Idun\u2019s warrior. But of course, they were so small that was embarrassing to compare them to the achievements made by the great warriors of Valhalla, although it was because they were the ones being compared.</p><br/><p>The warriors of King Ivar that had accompanied Helga were proud of the achievements set by their princess. Helga couldn\u2019t say it in front of others, but she was waiting for the day she could boast of her achievements in front of the warrior of Idun.</p><br/><p>It was regrettable that she couldn\u2019t enter Valhalla, but she had won and was returning with her loved ones. She also had her siblings to boast about her achievements.</p><br/><p>However, Helga placed all of that in a corner of her heart. It was because something more urgent and important was happening in front of them.</p><br/><p>Giants appeared in the mountains and rivers.</p><br/><p>The evil spirits that were born from Ymir\u2019s blood climbed up from under the ground and attacked the villages and cities.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t something that was happening in one place but in all the region. Someone had even said that Ragnarok had started.</p><br/><p>What would have happened with her hometown, Kataron? Was her father, King Ivar, safe?</p><br/><p>Helga thought of the faces of her siblings and the citizens and then gritted her teeth and kicked her horse.</p><br/><p>She had to hurry.</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>Siri and Bracky followed Ingrid. The three people that departed from the wooden dock went for one of the rooms located in the middle hall of Valhalla.</p><br/><p>The sound of a horn trumpet was heard by the three people that were running hurriedly. One was heard from inside of Valhalla, and the other one was heard from outside.</p><br/><p>Siri and Bracky knew instinctively what the two sounds meant.</p><br/><p>Ingrid gulped the silence at the fact that the things she had heard from her senior Valkyries was happening once again right now.</p><br/><p>The sound that was heard from outside was certainly the sound of the trumpet of war, Gjallarhorn.</p><br/><p>Gjallarhorn was a really special horn trumpet. The sound of it had rang out once throughout the long history of Valhalla.</p><br/><p>And it could only be like that. Because Gjallarhorn wasn\u2019t simply a horn trumpet that notified of an urgent situation.</p><br/><p>Mobilizing all the forces of Valhalla.</p><br/><p>Starting from the lowest-ranked warriors to the top rank and even the oldest Steel Warriors that had been slumbering for a long time all without exception.</p><br/><p>The fuss at their surroundings became amplified. The sounds of chains were heard endlessly at a far away place, and toothed wheels clashed with each other and made a machine-like sound.</p><br/><p>The door was opening.</p><br/><p>The 540 gates that were covering Valhalla in a circle, those located at the walls.</p><br/><p>Ingrid, who had stopped for a moment, urged Siri and Bracky on once more. It wasn\u2019t the time to be absentminded.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. We have to hurry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri didn\u2019t ask where they were going to, and Bracky realized instinctively why he had also gotten called with Siri when he belonged to another legion.</p><br/><p>There were already people that had arrived on the path that connected to Heimdall\u2019s fortress. They were faces that Siri and Bracky already knew well.</p><br/><p>Notung, the warrior of Heimdall\u2019s legion.</p><br/><p>Harabal, the warrior of Njord\u2019s legion.</p><br/><p>But there weren\u2019t only the two of them. All the intermediate-ranked warriors that had been in the expedition of Midgard were gathered.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will hurriedly go to Midgard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ingrid said.</p><br/><p>The warriors of Valhalla didn\u2019t speak anymore and followed her.</p><br/><p>The sound of Gjallarhorn was approaching.</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>Freya, who was riding on the cat carriage, was a mess. She was wearing a pijama that revealed underneath as she had just woken up after hearing the sound of the horn trumpet. She couldn\u2019t fix her plentiful and pretty hair and it flowed down her shoulders instead.</p><br/><p>But of course, she was still the Goddess of Beauty. She was emitting a different charm as it wasn\u2019t her usual self.</p><br/><p>But it wasn\u2019t the time to be minding about that.</p><br/><p>Freya covered herself roughly with the black coat a Valkyrie brought her and then hit the air with a whip made with the skin of a sea serpent. The cats became surprised at that sound and started to run in the air.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ugh, really.\u2019</p><br/><p>Freya bit her lips. She did expect that something would happen, but for Gjallarhorn to be the one to ring\u2026.</p><br/><p>In addition, Odin was also another case. There was no way for him, the God of Magic and Prophecy, to not have seen anything coming.</p><br/><p>\u2018He should have told me something!\u2019</p><br/><p>He is always stuck in the lake of Mimir!</p><br/><p>But of course, Freya herself knew that venting her anger was useless as Odin also wasn\u2019t omniscient.</p><br/><p>The thread of fate made by the three sisters and the result the head of Mimir came up after calculating countless variables wasn\u2019t absolute.</p><br/><p>The Gods of Asgard were like that.</p><br/><p>They were called as Gods but weren\u2019t absolute. They were existences that couldn\u2019t maintain eternal life without the golden apple of Idun.</p><br/><p>Mortal instead of immortal.</p><br/><p>Incomplete instead of complete.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why they could only fear the future. They could live on fierce lives like the existences in Midgard.</p><br/><p>Freya shook her head. Thinking about useless things on urgent situations was one of her old weaknesses.</p><br/><p>She took a deep breath and then rolled her fingers. She obtained information through the several magical networks she had spread in Asgard.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an utter mess.\u201d</p><br/><p>She cursed out unconsciously.</p><br/><p>The battle in the front lines still hadn\u2019t started, but it was like a kettle that was about to overflow.</p><br/><p>Giants and evil spirits were appearing in Midgard. In addition, their number was overwhelming.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn it. It\u2019s full of holes just like a torn rag. Just who the hell made it!\u2019</p><br/><p>Freya cursed the Great Barrier of Midgard for a moment and then had a moment of self criticism and rolled her fingers again.</p><br/><p>It was certain that a bunch of Garmr\u2019s soul fragments had appeared in the front lines, and it was seen that a few of them also appeared in Midgard.</p><br/><p>\u2018World wolf.\u2019</p><br/><p>Freya bit her lips. She called out the nickname of the existence that was uneasy and scary to say out loud.</p><br/><p>She pondered. She used her intelligent head to think about what she should do from now on.</p><br/><p>She had to first meet Odin.</p><br/><p>Freya was the landlady of Asgard. The conversation she was to have with Odin wasn\u2019t about how they would fight in the front lines.</p><br/><p>\u2018Midgard.\u2019</p><br/><p>They had to stop the resurrection of the world wolf. They had to dispatch warriors to Midgard and retrieve all of the soul fragments.</p><br/><p>\u2018Loki.\u2019</p><br/><p>It would probably be his doing. She didn\u2019t know how the soul fragments appeared in Midgard at the same time, but she could understand the giants that appeared right after that.</p><br/><p>It was clearly Loki. He had certainly made a hole in the Great Barrier which he and Odin had made.</p><br/><p>Freya turned her head. The representative Valkyrie of Freya\u2019s legion, Aherid, who was riding on the cat carriage with her, noticed the eyes of her master and hurriedly faced her.</p><br/><p>\u201cUp to where did the commander of Idun get?\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya was usually gentle and kind to the people below her, but her voice right now was sharp because of the situation.</p><br/><p>Aherid hurriedly said,</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s vigorously flying over here with a coffin of Vanaheim.\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t easy to use communication magic because of the sea of Ymir that was between Vanaheim and Asgard, but this was an emergency situation.</p><br/><p>They had already transmitted to him the situation\u2019s urgency with a really strong magic. As the sound of Gjallarhorn transcended time and space, Vanaheim would also act without pause.</p><br/><p>He would come flying.</p><br/><p>Freya nodded as she knew what that meant. It wouldn\u2019t take too long then.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s meet the King for now.\u201d</p><br/><p>She talked to himself as if trying to calm herself down and then hit the air with the whip once again. The cats increased their speed.</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>Hildegarde remained in Vanaheim.</p><br/><p>And that was the same for the legion of Freya that had come with her.</p><br/><p>The only one that was allowed to move with Idun\u2019s commander was Adenmaha, a Valkyrie of Idun\u2019s legion.</p><br/><p>Hildegarde breathed roughly after hearing the sound of Gjallarhorn. Skuld, who\u2019d arrived almost at the same time as the emergency notice, looked up the sky next to her.</p><br/><p>A black thing was crossing the sky.</p><br/><p>The thing that departed from Vanaheim was like a thread of a Black Flash.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let him reach in time.\u2019</p><br/><p>Skuld prayed inwardly, and Hildegarde and the warriors of Freya\u2019s legion did the same.</p><br/><p>And high in the sky, where the hopes of everyone reached, Adenmaha was letting out a scream.</p><br/><p>\u201c<i>Kyaaaaaaak!</i>\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t you think her scream is mixed with happiness?\u2019</p><br/><p>Because both Tae Ho and Adenmaha were packed in a coffin meant for only one person.</p><br/><p>However, Cuchulainn was wrong this time. Adenmaha was sincerely crying and screaming. Tears flowed down from her white face that had become pale because of the fright.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho embraced her tightly so that she could calm down and perhaps, a part of her scream was because it hurt.</p><br/><p>However, Tae Ho didn\u2019t plan on letting go of Adenmaha. No, precisely speaking he couldn\u2019t even think.</p><br/><p>Because it was too fast.</p><br/><p>It was a pain that they felt like they would die because of the increase in gravity, but a vague feeling was sweeping up his body that couldn\u2019t be explained by words.</p><br/><p>The thing Tae Ho and Adenmaha were riding on was a prototype of the Black Flash.</p><br/><p>It was faster than the Black Flash made after that, but it didn\u2019t take into account the comfortability of the passenger even by a little and was a test prototype that made one doubt if it really was made for a person.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho put more strength in his arms and yelled unconsciously.</p><br/><p>\u201cM-my lower body feels weiiiiiiiiiird!\u201d</p><br/><p>The scream of despair he had once heard from a warrior.</p><br/><p>The prototype of the Black Flash crossed the sea of Ymir.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 35 \u2013 Great War (1) &gt; End</p><hr/><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/><p>Episode 35/Chapter 2: Great War (2)</p><br/><p>TL: Tsubak</p><br/><p>ED: Julsmul</p><hr/><br/><p>Time passed.</p><br/><p>Even though the sound of Gjallarhorn was heard once again after a hundred years, the passage of time was the same as always.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t faster or slower than usual.</p><br/><p>The Gods and commanders were gathered in the front lines.</p><br/><p>The God of Thunder, Thor, wore an armor and helmet made with Unts and clenched Mjolnir.</p><br/><p>Next to him, the God of Hunting, Ullr, touched his golden bow. It was a strong, magical bow he had received from the Goddess of the Moon, Artemis, and Olympus\u2019s God of hunting as a token of their friendship.</p><br/><p>The one-armed Tir, who wasn\u2019t in the same place but was looking at them from a not too distant land, glared down at the fortress.</p><br/><p>The giants had come out of their fortress made with ice and rocks and were marching. There was still quite a distance between them, but it was only a matter of time until they reached the range of Asgard.</p><br/><p>The front lines of Asgard were really wide.</p><br/><p>And giants and evil spirits were pouring out as if planning to cover it all up.</p><br/><p>The frost giants were thinking of doing an all out war.</p><br/><p>It was a really sudden march, but at the same time, they knew too well that it would happen someday.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are ready.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thor said. He said that for the warriors and Ullr who were next to him, but also for himself.</p><br/><p>And those words weren\u2019t only meant to be heard well.</p><br/><p>Thor placed his eyes off the front lines and looked at his surroundings. There were already tens of thousands of warriors of Valhalla gathered in the fortress Thor was at.</p><br/><p>If one also counted the warriors in the other fortresses, they would amount to hundreds of thousands.</p><br/><p>In addition, this wasn\u2019t the complete force of Asgard and Valhalla.</p><br/><p>The Steel Warriors that were in a deep slumber were waking up.</p><br/><p>The warriors that were waiting in Valhalla were hurrying to go to war.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Asgard and the Nine Realms.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thor spoke naturally. He hit his chest twice, and the warriors near him did the same thing. He then addressed all the warriors gathered in the fortress.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Asgard and the Nine Realms.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Asgard and the Nine Realms.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sound of Gjallarhorn that was heard from far away started to ring.</p><br/><p>The time for war was approaching.</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>A root of Yggdrasil, the World Tree, that connected Midgard and Asgard, also reached Valhalla.</p><br/><p>Hermod, who\u2019d returned to the front lines of Valhalla, didn\u2019t participate in the conference between the Gods or encourage his warriors but kept riding with his horse instead. It was because he still had something to do as the God of Messages.</p><br/><p>Sleipnir, the horse that was born from the God Loki and a female horse long ago, was the fastest horse in Valhalla and also in all of Asgard.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s eight legs kicked the air and split the wind. Hermod kept riding on top of the World Tree and finally got out of Asgard. He passed the passageway that connected to Midgard and entered the underground.</p><br/><p>Below Midgard, the world of the living, was Niflheim, the world of the dead.</p><br/><p>That land that was filled with frost had the city of Helheim in it. Helheim was the city of souls that\u2019d died from illness or age and didn\u2019t die in the battlefield.</p><br/><p>Hermod went towards Helheim and looked at the several places of Niflheim. Fortunately enough, he couldn\u2019t see the traces of the giants.</p><br/><p>Sleipnir lowered its speed. It was because the residence of the queen, that was surging in the middle of Helheim, wasn\u2019t that far away.</p><br/><p>There were two entrances in the residence of the queen that looked like a winter tree that had no leaves. Hermod directed to the garden hanging in the air in the peak of the residence instead of going to the entrance in the ground.</p><br/><p>The plains that were connected with the second entrance to the residence appeared. Compared to a normal garden that was filled with various colors, this garden was dyed in only one color.</p><br/><p>White.</p><br/><p>It was cold and lonely but gave a trim feeling.</p><br/><p>Sleipnir landed on the garden. White, hot steam gushed from its mouth as it caught its breath.</p><br/><p>Hermod jumped down the saddle and took a deep breath. There was a woman wearing black clothes standing alone in the middle of the garden.</p><br/><p>\u201cMessenger Hermod of the King of Gods, Odin, greets the queen of Helheim. It\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hermod stopped ten steps before the woman and expressed etiquette first. The woman that was looking at the ice flowers that had bloomed in her garden turned around to look at Hermod.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt has been a while, Messenger God Hermod.\u201d</p><br/><p>She was a mystical woman. She, who had black hair that seemed like it would gulp down everything, had looks that were difficult to describe.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t about being pretty or not.</p><br/><p>She was seen as a cute girl. But when one saw her again, they could see that there was a beautiful lady standing there. If they blinked once more, they would see that she was an old lady that was in the brink of death.</p><br/><p>Her voice was also like that. Every time she spoke, it gave the feeling that one was listening to the voice of different ages.</p><br/><p>The owner of Helheim and the queen of the dead, Hela.</p><br/><p>Hermod had met her once after the Great War, just like right now.</p><br/><p>It was to ask her of a method to bring back the several dead ones that had died in the Great War including the God of Light, Baldur.</p><br/><p>But it was impossible. Helheim was only a place where the souls of the dead humans resided for a short time. The soul of Gods didn\u2019t reach Helheim. Hela was the queen of the dead ones, not the queen of death. She didn\u2019t have the power to control life and death.</p><br/><p>Hermod, who had fallen into a great frustration after the Great War, vented his anger on Hela.</p><br/><p>He poured out all kinds of curses asking why she wasn\u2019t resurrecting the dead ones, and if she wasn\u2019t going to do that, why was she in her seat of responsibility.</p><br/><p>It was an embarrassing memory. He apologized politely after that, and even though Hela had forgiven him saying that it was completely understandable, Hermod couldn\u2019t raise his head properly every time he met her.</p><br/><p>And it was even more so this time.</p><br/><p>The reason why Hermod had come to Helheim wasn\u2019t to ask Hela how she was doing.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry. Compared to my brothers, my heart belongs to Asgard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hela smiled and spoke first as Hermod hesitated to speak.</p><br/><p>That dry smile resembled a branch of the winter tree branch.</p><br/><p>When the Great War was coming to a close, the God of Lies and Fire, Loki, betrayed Asgard and stood at the side of the giants.</p><br/><p>The sons of Loki, the World Wolf, Fenrir, and the Space Snake, Jormungand, were also threatening foes to Asgard.</p><br/><p>It was obvious for Asgard to be suspicious of Hela as her father and brothers had all turned against Asgard.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I know better than anyone what you think about Asgard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hermod said sincerely. Hela had already proved her loyalty towards Asgard several times. Just the army of the deceased that was filling the empty spot of Valhalla was proof of that.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry as you are merely doing your task.\u201d</p><br/><p>She answered in a low voice and slowly rolled her fingers. She drew a rune in the air and showed it to Hermod.</p><br/><p>\u201cA troop of the deceased is gathering in Naglfar. If Asgard calls for them, I will dispatch them at any time.\u201d</p><br/><p>The warship, Naglfar, made with the nails of the deceased.</p><br/><p>Hermod nodded. He purposely revealed a bright smile and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m really grateful. I will certainly transmit to Odin about your unchanging heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hela smiled faintly once again. She formed a fist with her slender fingers and then hit her chest twice.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Asgard and the Nine Realms.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Asgard and the Nine Realms.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hermod expressed etiquette and then hesitated a bit before mounting Sleipnir.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave your residence. You will be safe if you stay in Helheim.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will pray for your safety.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hela said with a gentle voice. Hermod nodded once again and then departed with Sleipnir.</p><br/><p>The horse with eight legs kicked the air. Hela just saw the back of Hermod leaving the garden and then looked at an even farther place.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather.\u201d</p><br/><p>The God of Fire and Lies, Loki.</p><br/><p>Midgard was at the end of Hela\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>When Freya arrived at the central hall of Valhalla after crossing the fog lake, she got down the cat carriage and walked. The sound of the horn trumpet that was heard outside and inside of Valhalla made her feel complicated.</p><br/><p>\u201c<i>Whew, whew</i>. Calm down. Let\u2019s calm down, Freya.\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya looked at the entrance of the conference room of the Gods and mumbled in a low voice. There was nothing good by getting excited. It was important to calm down and think calmly the more urgent the situation was.</p><br/><p>\u2018You are already the best beauty in Asgard and the Nine Realms, but you will become an even more beautiful woman if you fix your rash temperament.\u2019</p><br/><p>Those were the words her brother had said long ago. She was already the greatest beauty but would become even more beautiful. His words were a mess, but she didn\u2019t dislike hearing it. Freya really liked the words of her brother.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ah, really.\u2019</p><br/><p>She was trying to calm down herself but now she was about to get depressed.</p><br/><p>Because her brother, Freyr, wasn\u2019t in this world anymore. He had lost his life in the Great War.</p><br/><p>Freyr wasn\u2019t the only one that had disappeared. Freya\u2019s husband, Odr, had also died in the Great War. He was a really heartless and foolish man. He had the most beautiful woman in Asgard and the Nine Realms as his wife and roamed the worlds with the desire to travel.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s all in the past.\u2019</p><br/><p>Freya closed her eyes and opened them. Instead of becoming a woman that cried for tragic love, she acted confidently as the landlady of Asgard.</p><br/><p>The warriors that were protecting the door of the conference room grew enchanted by Freya\u2019s beauty even in this urgent situation. They opened the door only after being urged by the representative Valkyrie of Freya\u2019s legion, Aherid, and when Freya entered the room, she could feel the Gods concentrating on her.</p><br/><p>\u201cFreya.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFreya.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were both male and female Gods, and all of them were trembling in fear. It was understandable as the one in this place had a long distance from battle and war.</p><br/><p>The Gods that had legions and were capable of battling were already out in the front lines.</p><br/><p>Half of the Gods didn\u2019t come to this place as they were busy taking preparations for leading the reserve corps that were in Valhalla, and the other half remained silent.</p><br/><p>Freya remained silent.</p><br/><p>She just looked at the various places of the conference room instead of facing the weak Gods that wanted to hear words of comfort from her.</p><br/><p>Excluding the few Gods like Idun that couldn\u2019t get out of their residence, almost all of them were gathered here. If only the King of Gods, Odin arrived, they would be able to start with the conference.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. There are no problems. We prepared many things after the Great War.\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya sat in the second highest seat and said some words of comfort towards the scared Gods.</p><br/><p>She was inwardly saying so to bless their warriors at least one more time instead of crying like this, but what came out of her mouth were gentle and beautiful words.</p><br/><p>\u2018And why isn\u2019t this man coming?\u2019</p><br/><p>It was when Freya was battling against her patience and anxiousness that the King of Gods Odin finally arrived the conference room. All the eyes that were looking at Freya moved to Odin.</p><br/><p>The King of Gods, Odin, had several nicknames.</p><br/><p>He was the God of Magic and Prophecies and was also a wanderer God that roamed the world endlessly.</p><br/><p>But right now, the one that stood in front of them was the God of War. He\u2019d armed himself completely with equipment made of Unts and there was the Absolute Spear, Gungnir, in his hands.</p><br/><p>The Gods stayed silent. They couldn\u2019t say their worries just like they had done with Freya. They just shut their mouths and remained still.</p><br/><p>Odin passed over that silence. He sat on the seat that was next to Freya and then said shortly,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Great War has resumed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Odin claimed. Some of the Gods put pained expressions at his words.</p><br/><p>It was because they thought that it was in its early stages, but they weren\u2019t able to correct it.</p><br/><p>The giants had started to move in the front lines, and droves of them were appearing in several places of Midgard, but it wasn\u2019t that they had clashed yet.</p><br/><p>But that was only a dream, for the King of Gods, Odin, had claimed that the Great War had resumed.</p><br/><p>\u201cA bunch of Garmr\u2019s soul fragments appeared in the front lines. We can also see that several of them appeared in Midgard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Odin kept explaining the situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cA battle will soon occur in the front lines, but that isn\u2019t our battlefield. We can\u2019t ignore Midgard. We can\u2019t let the giants put their hands on the soul fragments and awaken the World Wolf. We can\u2019t permit them trampling on the humans of Midgard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Someone gulped dry saliva and another wanted to speak about the Great Barrier of Midgard.</p><br/><p>Odin stayed silent for a moment. He gathered the eyes of the Gods and then said briefly,</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are removing the Great Barrier of Midgard.\u201d</p><br/><p>The great barrier had already a lot of holes in it, but of course, an enormous difference existed between opening it up completely and merely having holes in it; however, Odin decided to do that. It was because the existence of the Great Barrier was interfering in the deployment to Midgard.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will dispatch forces composed of mainly superior-ranked warriors to retrieve all of the soul fragments in one go and sweep up the giants that appeared in Midgard. After that, Freya will install the Great Barrier once again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Regardless, the giants of Jotunheim wouldn\u2019t stay still watching.</p><br/><p>But that was also the same for Asgard and Valhalla.</p><br/><p>The eyes of the Gods moved to Freya. She flinched for a moment but then smiled as if telling them to relax.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have already prepared long ago. I can do it plentily.\u201d</p><br/><p>With some meaning, her words were more comforting than the words of the King of Gods, Odin.</p><br/><p>Freya smiled brightly once again to calm down the Gods and then glared at Odin slightly. Odin then spoke to her with his mind.</p><br/><p>\u2018We will debate about the specific details when the organization finishes. Did you retrieve the chest from Vanaheim?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018The commander of Idun is bringing it right now. It won\u2019t take long.\u2019</p><br/><p>The commander of Idun.</p><br/><p>The warrior of Idun.</p><br/><p>Odin nodded. He turned to look at the other Gods and then ended the conference after some brief words.</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>Adenmaha didn\u2019t speak anymore. She\u2019d loosened her body in a half unconscious state in Tae Ho\u2019s embrace, and Tae Ho still clutched Adenmaha tightly and gritted his teeth.</p><br/><p>And after some time-</p><br/><p>The Black Flash landed on the ground. The moment they landed, a terrible pain swept over Tae Ho and Adenmaha, but it was important that they could arrive on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hey, get down, quickly! Adenmaha is about to throw up!\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn got surprised and yelled. Tae Ho swung his arm rashly while still being in pain to throw the door open and then took Adenmaha and got out of the Black Flash.</p><br/><p>\u201cH<i>up! Burgh!</i>\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha, in pain while covering her mouth, threw herself to the ground and started to vomit. Tae Ho calmed himself by taking some air and then patted on Adenmaha\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>\u2018How terrible.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn sincerely sympathized with Adenmaha. It wasn\u2019t only because she started to throw up in front of Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>The place they had arrived was Freya\u2019s residence in her legion. The Valkyries and warriors that were waiting for Tae Ho looked at Adenmaha heaving her guts up and Tae Ho who was patting her back.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere. Blow your nose.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Tae Ho gave her a handkerchief, Adenmaha blew her nose with a face filled with pain and embarrassment and then wiped off her mouth with another handkerchief. Her eyes were red.</p><br/><p>And one of the Valkyries that had been looking at all of that got courage and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, um. Are you the commander of Idun?\u201d</p><br/><p>She knew it but was still asking because of the formalities.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho checked Adenmaha\u2019s state for the last time and then stood up and faced the Valkyrie of Freya\u2019s legion.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am the commander of Idun. I received an order from Freya-nim and brought the chest of Vanaheim.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am Valkyrie Hrist of Freya\u2019s legion. Greetings to the commander of Idun.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Valkyrie that expressed etiquette to Tae Ho quickly continued to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cFreya-nim is currently in the central hall of Valhalla. We will deliver her the chest of Vanaheim.\u201d</p><br/><p>The one that was entrusted with it was Tae Ho, so originally, this kind of intervention was a big rudeness; however, the situation was as it was. Tae Ho took out the chest of Vanaheim from Unnir and then gave it to Valkyrie Hrist.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you. A ship is waiting for you in the dock to bring you to Idun\u2019s legion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho nodded once again.</p><br/><p>He would rather welcome being able to visit Idun\u2019s legion for a moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, Adenmaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha nodded once instead of answering and then followed Tae Ho\u2019s back. Valkyrie Sigrun and the ship of Idun\u2019s legion was waiting for him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun-nim is waiting for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no need to say anymore.</p><br/><p>The ship started to head towards Idun\u2019s residence after boarding Tae Ho and Adenmaha.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 35 \u2013 Great War (2) &gt; End</p><hr/><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/><p>Episode 35/Chapter 3: Great War (3)</p><br/><p>TL: Tsubak</p><br/><p>ED: Julsmul</p><hr/><br/><p>The ships of each legion were sailing busily in the fog lake.</p><br/><p>The sound of the horn trumpet that was heard periodically made one feel nervous by itself.</p><br/><p>Sigrun gulped dry saliva several times with a stiff expression. While she was in the Valkyrie Training Center, she received several nicknames like Heart of Steel and The Immovable Sigrun as her expression didn\u2019t change much in any situation, and she had her tall height. But the truth was different.</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t particularly brave compared to her external looks, but of course, that didn\u2019t mean that she was a coward, and it also didn\u2019t mean that she held her composure at anytime and anywhere to the point that she was outstanding amongst the Valkyries.</p><br/><p>Sigrun didn\u2019t have many expressions. Precisely speaking, when she put a particular expression, it didn\u2019t look like her face had changed at all.</p><br/><p>Even when she smiled brightly, it looked expressionless by the others perspectives, and they barely managed to recognize when she started to laugh excessively.</p><br/><p>Sigrun closed her eyes and breathed. She had only gone out to one or two expeditions since she graduated from the training center, but the Great War had resumed. She couldn\u2019t say this to anyone, but it felt like her vision was darkening because of her fear.</p><br/><p>Just what would happen from now on? She had heard that half of all Valkyries had lost their lives in the previous Great War. Would it be the same this time?</p><br/><p>What about the warriors? The warriors of Idun\u2019s legion. The warriors that had been in the same battlefield as her and shared laughter and battle cries together.</p><br/><p>She was afraid of losing them. Terrified. This was the first time she realized how much of a coward she was.</p><br/><p>Sigrun forced herself to breathe once more, but no matter how many times she did so, her heart couldn\u2019t calm down.</p><br/><p>But it was at that moment-</p><br/><p>\u201cMay Idun\u2019s blessing accompany you.\u201d</p><br/><p>A soft feeling was felt on her forehead. The divine power of Idun that was warm and gentle began to cover her entire body starting from her forehead.</p><br/><p>Sigrun opened her eyes while being enchanted and, just like expected, she saw Tae Ho in front of her.</p><br/><p>\u201cCommander-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sigrun offered greetings. She had an expressionless face like always, but Tae Ho could vaguely comprehend what she was thinking about.</p><br/><p>[The Scared]</p><br/><p>[Sigrun]</p><br/><p>Heda realized it instantly when Tae Ho used the \u2018Eyes of the Dragon\u2019, but it seemed like Sigrun didn\u2019t notice even a little.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho grabbed Sigrun\u2019s hands. She became surprised and opened her eyes widely, but she didn\u2019t fall back or take her hands away.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho looked at her eyes fixedly and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright to be scared, and it isn\u2019t weird at all. It\u2019s the same for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sigrun blinked and gulped dryly. She unknowingly leaned her ear towards Tae Ho\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut still, you can fight. You aren\u2019t alone. There are others by your side.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was strength behind Tae Ho\u2019s words. Sigrun thought of Gudrun, who was at the training center with her. She thought of the lowest-ranked warriors saying that they would protect her in the expeditions.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun should be watching over us, and our comrades will be with us, so lets be more courageous and protect ourselves with our treasured ones. You can do this, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho asked. Sigrun held her breath at his really gentle question and nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho smiled once again. He let go Sigrun\u2019s hands and hit his chest twice.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Asgard and the Nine Realms.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Asgard and the Nine Realms.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Her nervousness has faded]</p><br/><p>[The Determined]</p><br/><p>[Sigrun]</p><br/><p>Tae Ho checked on Sigrun\u2019s status and grabbed her shoulders. He blessed her one more time.</p><br/><p>\u201cMay Idun\u2019s blessing accompany you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMay Idun\u2019s blessing accompany you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sigrun blessed Tae Ho back. It was a face filled with shyness that wasn\u2019t at all like her.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. Cheer up, then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, commander-nim!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho patted Sigrun\u2019s shoulders and then turned away to walk towards the cabins. Cuchulainn, who\u2019d been silent until now, said,</p><br/><p>\u2018It seems like you just said some random words, but her reaction is good. Is this the effect of Bragi\u2019s rune?\u2019</p><br/><p>It seemed like he didn\u2019t quite like the words Tae Ho had said, and he was clicking his tongue.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, your brain won\u2019t be different just because you received his rune.\u2019</p><br/><p>The origin of one\u2019s thoughts was their brain, not their tongue.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho grew irritated and quickly retorted,</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! I still chose my words carefully. Besides, I\u2019ve already seen the effects before.\u201d</p><br/><p>His words were truthful. He had said similar words to the youngest one in his team that was trembling before the world championship of Dark Age to give him courage.</p><br/><p>\u2018So that was the case. That had happened before. Only I didn\u2019t know about that.\u2019</p><br/><p>The effect of imitating Heda was really great. Tae Ho felt worse than having heard curses and let out a sigh but then regained his composure.</p><br/><p>Because Cuchulainn wouldn\u2019t be serious about this. He would be joking to soothe his nervousness.</p><br/><p>\u2018No. I\u2019m honest.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn had perfectly mastered Tae Ho\u2019s pattern of thinking by being with him for two years and added another blow for good measure.</p><br/><p>As Tae Ho put on some lukewarm eyes, he snickered and said another thing.</p><br/><p>\u2018Anyways, you are gathering blessings really hard as soon as the number limit got released.\u2019</p><br/><p>Sigrun had come to meet Tae Ho and gave him a blessing. She had cleared all the requisites for the \u2018Valkyrie that had a Warrior Meet Him\u2019.</p><br/><p>Of course, he could only make a fake Valkyrie with a really low completion rate as he had only been blessed once, but still, it was better than having nothing.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have to strengthen my force even if only by a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Right, then you should also rest. You must be exhausted because you rode on the Black Flash.\u2019</p><br/><p>There was a high possibility that he wouldn\u2019t be able to rest after returning to the residence. He had to rest when he could.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho heard Cuchulainn\u2019s words to be correct and then lay down on a bed after entering the closest cabin.</p><br/><p>And at the same time-</p><br/><p>Sigrun, who was putting on an enchanted face in front of the cabin, grew surprised and turned her head around. It was because Adenmaha was approaching her while having a paled and painful face.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Sigrun asked with a worried face, Adenmaha frowned and then sat next to Sigrun after determining herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha gathered her lips and then said with a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t covet him, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sigrun didn\u2019t answer instantly. It was because she needed time to realize what Adenmaha was talking about.</p><br/><p>But it didn\u2019t take that long. Sigrun smiled at Adenmaha that was snorting while looked sideways and upwards at her and nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha let out a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>The time of rest was short. Tae Ho hurriedly got down the ship as soon as he arrived at the residence of Idun. The warriors of Idun\u2019s legion were lined up and completely armed upon the wooden dock.</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeda.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were many eyes looking at them, but he didn\u2019t mind. He ran towards Heda and she also didn\u2019t hold him back. They hugged each other and then shared blessings.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha and Sigrun got down off the ship too. Heda slightly pushed Tae Ho and smiled towards Adenmaha.</p><br/><p>\u201cAdenmaha, you have done well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the task of a Valkyrie.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha pouted slightly and snorted like always and Sigrun approached Gudrun.</p><br/><p>Heda looked at Tae Ho and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cOur legion also received an order to go to war. Our warriors will be dispatched on the defense of the outskirts under the command of Gudrun and Sigrun.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho read several things in her short words, and that\u2019s why he asked Heda directly,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere do I have to go?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho would act separately from the legion because there were really few things he could do with ten lowest-ranked warriors. The fact that Heda or Adenmaha weren\u2019t the leaders suggested that Tae Ho would act alone.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will tell you starting from now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda glanced at Sigrun and Gudrun and gave her a short order and then took Tae Ho and Adenmaha and entered a building near the dock. Merlin and Scathach were waiting there. Ragnar wasn\u2019t seen as expected. He would probably be with the Gods in the front lines.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy King.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho shared short greetings with the two people and then looked at the map that was spread over the table. Asgard and Midgard were drawn next to a line drawn in the middle.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou may already know this, but I will still explain quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda got in front of the map and then placed shining rocks on top of it and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cA bunch of Garmr\u2019s soul fragments appeared in the front lines, and they also appeared in several places of Midgard almost at the same time.\u201d</p><br/><p>The number of fragments Asgard has gotten rid of numbered six in total.</p><br/><p>It was estimated that the number of fragments were about fourteen or fifteen, so the remaining eight or nine had appeared almost at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are guessing that the soul fragments in Midgard woke up due to the influence of a bunch of fragments having appeared at the front lines.\u201d</p><br/><p>The number of shining rocks Heda placed atop the front lines was five. She didn\u2019t exactly know how many fragments were needed to wake Fenrir, but there was a high possibility for it to awaken with naught but one or two more being gathered.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe front lines are in a state that may explode at any time. Giants and evil spirits also appeared in Midgard, and based on Freya-nim\u2019s words, it seemed like the God of Lies, Loki, was the one to spread them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda placed several red flags over Midgard. The situation was more severe than when they had dealt with the fomoires.</p><br/><p>There was the possibility that battle may be occurring even in this moment. In addition, if it was that number, it couldn\u2019t be dealt with only the warriors of Valhalla that were already in Midgard.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho thought of Helga, King Ivar, and the knights of Kataron.</p><br/><p>He remembered the battlefields he had shared with the humans.</p><br/><p>It was impossible with just them. They needed the reinforcement of Asgard faster.</p><br/><p>\u201cOdin came up with the plan to retrieve Garmr\u2019s soul fragments after dispatching the majority of the force to Midgard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda placed blue flags in Midgard, and Tae Ho understood what they meant.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre we removing the Great Barrier?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly. Deploying superior-ranked warriors after the barrier is removed is the essence of this plan.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Great Barrier didn\u2019t only stop the giants but also existences above the superior rank.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why they would remove the barrier. They would deploy a lot of strong warriors and take care of the fuss in Midgard in an instant.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know what you are thinking about. The giants will also be able to dispatch the forces when the Great Barrier is removed. Before Freya-nim installs the barrier again\u2026.a really big battle will occur. It won\u2019t be easy at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the Great War, Midgard had suffered almost no losses, but it would be different this time. A sea\u2019s worth of blood would flow, a notion scary just by thinking about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho, an order that you should participate in this strategy as the commander of Idun came down. Merlin and Adenmaha will accompany you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda wouldn\u2019t go with him. Tae Ho nodded because he was already expecting it. Idun needed someone to protect her as she couldn\u2019t leave the golden apple tree. If it was Scathach and Heda, he could trust in them.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will entrust Idun-nim to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda put a bright smile forcefully and then grabbed Tae Ho\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not much time. You have to go greet Idun-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I must do it this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda smiled at his words. Adenmaha, who was looking at the two of them, said in a low voice,</p><br/><p>\u201cI will be preparing to depart.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha and Merlin got out of the building first. Tae Ho gave Gae Bolg to Scathach before going to the shrine with Heda.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for your consideration.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because Scathach and Cuchulain would also need some time for themselves.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho went to the shrine with Heda. After waiting for a bit after entering alone, he could feel Idun\u2019s divine power like usual.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy warrior, Tae Ho.\u201d</p><br/><p>Idun was smiling below the golden apple tree. It was a warm and gentle smile like always, but Tae Ho could feel a bit of sadness hidden within it this time.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho approached Idun. She stroked the cheek of Tae Ho, who\u2019d knelt down before her, and asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you greet Father and Mother?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was the question he had been expecting. Tae Ho nodded slowly and looked at Idun\u2019s rune that was engraved in his wrist.</p><br/><p>\u201cI received runes from the previous Idun-nim\u2026..and Bragi-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Idun\u2019s eyes were still covered, but Tae Ho could feel the grief which filled them.</p><br/><p>Idun took a breath. She smacked her lips a few times and then drew a sad smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was going to share a long story with you\u2026\u2026when you retrieved the legacy. I was about to tell you the several things that were related with the Great War, but we will have to leave it for later as the situation doesn\u2019t allow it.\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t the time to be talking about the past.</p><br/><p>Right in this moment, a battle may be occurring in Midgard.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy warrior, Tae Ho. My only commander.\u201d</p><br/><p>Idun lowered her posture. She got to the height of Tae Ho\u2019s eyes and then embraced him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only one thing I\u2019m hoping from you, and I will also give you one order.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho could feel Idun\u2019s heat. He could feel his chest burning at her sincere voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cReturn alive. You must do it, no matter what happens.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was fear in Idun\u2019s voice, and Tae Ho smiled towards her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will obey your order.\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a random remark. Idun bit her lips and then nodded. She slightly pushed back Tae Ho and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen the Great Barrier is removed, the obstacle that disturbs our connection will also disappear. So use \u2018Idun\u2019s Warrior\u2019 as I will always accompany you. I will support you with all my strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will do so.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. We really don\u2019t have anymore time. You should also have time for Heda, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Idun spoke a bit playfully and stood up. She raised Tae Ho to his feet and then gave him her best blessing.</p><br/><p>\u201cMay my blessing accompany you.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was the same end as always, but Tae Ho placed his lips on her forehead by impulse. He spoke towards her, someone who hadn\u2019t ever been able to receive a blessing, and offered one of his own.</p><br/><p>\u201cMay my blessing accompany you.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a blessing that didn\u2019t exist nor had any sort of magical effect. Earlier, the blessing Tae Ho gave Sigrun was through utilizing the divine power of Idun.</p><br/><p>However, Idun put on a dumbfounded expression and giggled like a girl.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the best blessing. Really the best.\u201d</p><br/><p>Idun smiled brightly and took a step back. She clenched her fist and then hit her chest twice.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo, my warrior, Tae Ho. For Asgard and the Nine Realms.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Asgard and the Nine Realms.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho also hit his chest twice and added.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Idun.\u201d</p><br/><p>Idun laughed once more. She sent away Tae Ho while putting aside her regret.</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>Tae Ho distributed the weapons of the seniors of Idun\u2019s legion that he\u2019d acquired in Vanaheim to the warriors that were lined up at the dock.</p><br/><p>There were many excessive weapons for the lowest-ranked warriors, but he didn\u2019t mind. Actually, he didn\u2019t even care if he lost all of the weapons. It was more important if at least one more warrior returned.</p><br/><p>Sigrun and Gudrun led the warriors and left out of the residence first.</p><br/><p>Scathach returned Gae Bolg to Tae Ho, and Adenmaha and Merlin got on the wooden boat and waited for him.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho and Heda didn\u2019t share long words. They shared a deep and long blessing for the last time and then sent each other away.</p><br/><p>The wooden boat went towards the central hall of Valhalla.</p><br/><p>And at the same time, Valkyrie Hrist delivered the coffin of Vanaheim to Freya.</p><br/><p>Freya looked at Odin and he nodded.</p><br/><p>He said the thing that was decided once again with a resolute expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will remove the Great Barrier.\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya then opened the chest of Vanaheim.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 35 \u2013 Great War (3) &gt; End</p><hr/><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/><p>Episode 35/Chapter 4: Great War (4)</p><br/><p>TL: Tsubak</p><br/><p>ED: Julsmul</p><hr/><br/><p>The wooden boat advanced. Tae Ho, who was looking out before the shaking boat, saw that there were green words in front of him.</p><br/><p>There were already dozens of ships of others legions gathered in the dock. He could also see the ship of Idun\u2019s legion that had departed first.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt feels like the dock is full.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha blinked and said, and Tae Ho agreed to it. It was the first time that so many warriors had gathered in this place since he\u2019d entered Valhalla.</p><br/><p>It felt like they would number to more than a thousand even if he counted them at a glance, and Tae Ho soon realized that there were two more docks in this place.</p><br/><p>The lowest and inferior-ranked warriors were being led by the Valkyries and moving in order. Adenmaha took out the order Heda had given her and checked where they had to go.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho, who was tying up the boat while Adenmaha was checking the document, turned his head at the presence he felt. His movements were so natural that the one that was planning to surprise Tae Ho was the one that rather got surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have eyes on your back?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBjorn.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was Bjorn, someone whom he hadn\u2019t seen in a really long time. He hadn\u2019t been able to see him since he\u2019d left for Midgard.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, it should feel like an long while no matter who I see.\u2019</p><br/><p>Because he had been confined within the Tower of Shadows for two years.</p><br/><p>But whatever the case, he was certainly a glad to see a familiar face. As Tae Ho stood up from his seat, Bjorn requested a handshake.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have become really strong in the time I haven\u2019t seen you. I knew that you had potential, but I couldn\u2019t have guessed that you would be this much stronger than before!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bjorn laughed and patted on Tae Ho\u2019s shoulder, and at that moment, Tae Ho realized something. There was no need to use his \u2018Eyes of the Dragon\u2019.</p><br/><p>Bjorn wasn\u2019t an inferior-ranked warrior nor an intermediate-ranked one.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were a superior-ranked warrior all along.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. Unfortunately enough, though, I still haven\u2019t been able to climb to the top rank.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Tir\u2019s legion]</p><br/><p>[Superior-ranked Warrior]</p><br/><p>[Bjorn Ironside]</p><br/><p>Several doubts were cleared but new ones were created.</p><br/><p>Bjorn smiled first and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cI will introduce myself first. My name is Bjorn Ironside, the son of the great Viking King, Ragnar Lodbrok.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>He asked in disbelief. Bjorn laughed once again and shrugged his shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201c<i>Heh</i>. I understand. I am indeed a bit famous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t actually know about you\u2026.but you are the son of Master Ragnar?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bjorn flinched as Tae Ho spoke as if he really didn\u2019t know about him but then shook his head and hit his chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. I am the son of that Ragnar Lodbrok and the one that was called the Adventure King, Viking Bjorn Ironside.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adventure King. He certainly didn\u2019t know, and because of that, Tae Ho decided to focus on another thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that you speak like this, you are indeed a bit similar. Your eyes, for instance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOur character should be a bit different. People say that I resemble my mother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bjorn shook his head as if he had given up getting a reaction from Tae Ho and then started to explain the necessary things as always.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut whatever the case, you seem like you are curious. What if I were to tell you that I\u2019m in the same situation as Father? I received a really big injury in the Great War. That\u2019s why, rather than battling on the front lines, I roamed several legions to discover some rising stars and support them. It seems like I\u2019m bragging, but\u2026.what do you think would have happened if you weren\u2019t able to meet me that first day?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho nodded unconsciously. It was just like Bjorn had said.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho had gotten dragged to the battlefield while he didn\u2019t know anything about Valhalla. If Bjorn hadn\u2019t been there, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to think about creating a saga and then, rather than surviving, he would have become a Steel Warrior faster than anyone.</p><br/><p>But thinking about it, that wasn\u2019t the only case. In the early stages after he\u2019d entered Valhalla, Bjorn had appeared in several places and given him advice and help.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, but it\u2019s not that I have been following you. There was no need to do so at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because Tae Ho performed much better than he thought. In addition, he also had Heda. As she came to find him every day and gave him all sorts of help, Bjorn had nothing to do besides watch.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, I was a bit worried. I didn\u2019t know that you would go to Idun\u2019s legion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Tae Ho entered it, Idun\u2019s legion had no new warriors for a hundred years. Actually, it was obvious that he grew worried as he was entering a legion only in name.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho also thought like that at first, but now he could speak more confidently than anyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad I entered Idun\u2019s legion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because he was able to meet Heda. Because he was able to serve Idun as his Goddess.</p><br/><p>Bjorn nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. It looked like that. You should be grateful that you entered Idun\u2019s legion. If you had gone to another legion\u2026\u2026.I wonder, I don\u2019t know if talking about this would have any meaning, but I think that you won\u2019t have been able to reach your current level.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because it really was like that.</p><br/><p>If he didn\u2019t have Heda\u2019s and Idun\u2019s dedicated help, the current Tae Ho wouldn\u2019t have been able to exist. No, in the first place, if he didn\u2019t have Idun\u2019s blessing, he would have become a Steel Warrior on his first expedition.</p><br/><p>Idun\u2019s warrior.</p><br/><p>That was Tae Ho himself. He couldn\u2019t imagine any other name aside of that.</p><br/><p>Bjorn nodded in consecution as if he liked Tae Ho\u2019s prideful face and then looked at Adenmaha that was flipping the documents and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways, I will give you a bit of help. I know well where you have to go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha raised her head. Her eyes were filled with fear at that. She didn\u2019t want to become a useless Valkyrie for Tae Ho, but a sense of relief soon followed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s obvious to get lost if you are a new Valkyrie as the dock today is really complicated. The Valkyries of other legions were also quite lost.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bjorn smiled and spoke like a good person and winked towards Adenmaha. She snorted like always but then slightly bowed and expressed her thanks to him.</p><br/><p>Bjorn said once again,</p><br/><p>\u201cSiri and Bracky were led by Ingrid to Midgard. You were chosen as one of the superior-ranked warriors that will get deployed to Midgard as soon as the Great Barrier gets removed.\u201d</p><br/><p>The latter contents were ones he already knew, but the other things were a bit unexpected.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho felt anxious and asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you also going?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am going to Midgard but to a different place from you. There are a lot of scandalous places, you know.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was when Bjorn had finished speaking that the sound of a horn trumpet was heard from far away, but this blare was different from the ones that were heard until now.</p><br/><p>\u201c<i>Ugh</i>. We should hurry. It seems like they will be departing soon. Follow me, quick.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bjorn walked forward and opened a path. Adenmaha hurriedly stood up and followed Tae Ho with Merlin.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t going to use the Bifrost?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho asked while looking at the path that connected to the fortress of Heimdal, and Bjorn shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are too many people for that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Half of the warriors that were gathered on the dock would be going to the outskirts or the front lines just like the lowest-ranked warriors of Idun\u2019s legion were, but the remaining half would go to Midgard.</p><br/><p>Bjorn passed the warriors and moved to a place that had few people and then black and familiar things appeared in front of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, is that\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha asked with an uneasy face. She had never rode on it or seen it move, but she remembered seeing it standing still on the battlefield and so could guess what it was used for.</p><br/><p>Rain of Steel.</p><br/><p>And the fastest model at that.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho took a deep breath. Thinking about it, it was an obvious thing as most of the warriors rode on the Rains of Steel when they attacked the base of the fomoires.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s cheer up, fighting!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho cheered Adenmaha and walked towards the steel structures.</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>Freya recited a chant with a nervous face.</p><br/><p>The place that was the conference room for the Gods was now adorned with a huge magical circle.</p><br/><p>The Gods that didn\u2019t have a legion stood on certain places of the magic circle. It was to act as living rechargers to supply enough strength in the recreation of the Great Barrier.</p><br/><p>Freya stood in the center of the magic circle and then checked that the powerful magical tools she took out from the coffin of Vanaheim were in their right places. Every second was precious right now, but that\u2019s why she had to inspect it more carefully.</p><br/><p>\u2018Good, there\u2019s no problem. You can do it. Oppa would also compliment you.\u2019</p><br/><p>Freya mumbled inwardly and then raised her head and looked at Odin upon a high platform.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m ready.\u2019</p><br/><p>Freya said with her eyes. The time needed to remove the Great Barrier and install a new one wasn\u2019t short.</p><br/><p>Even if it was set up in the most ideal timeframe, it would certainly take a few hours.</p><br/><p>In that time, the warriors had to protect Midgard. They had to successfully retrieve the soul fragments and crush the ambitions of the giants.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s start.\u201d</p><br/><p>Odin spoke in a low voice. The Gods lowered their posture and started to insert magic power in the magic circle.</p><br/><p>The removal of the Great Barrier.</p><br/><p>The installation of a new one.</p><br/><p>Odin stabbed the air with Gungnir, and the breakdown of the Great Barrier followed.</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>The God of Fire and Lies, Loki, who was in Midgard, could see it clearly.</p><br/><p>The Great Barrier had started to break. The barrier that had been protecting Midgard for the past hundred years was being removed.</p><br/><p>At the same time, existences that had mighty power were approaching from different places.</p><br/><p>The superior-ranked warriors of Valhalla.</p><br/><p>And the giants of Jotunheim.</p><br/><p>The things that both sides were aiming for were the same. The soul fragments of Garmr that had appeared in several places of Midgard.</p><br/><p>Loki looked away. He looked under the ground and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>The Giant of the Night, Avalt, sensed that the Great Barrier had started to disappear. The time his king was talking about had come.</p><br/><p>The Giant of Beasts, Ortr, roared and the Giant of the Sea lead his army and marched.</p><br/><p>The Magician King, Utgard Loki, stood up from his throne and looked towards Midgard and Asgard.</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>The battle started in the front lines, and at the same time, the steel structures that were fired from Valhalla poured down on Midgard.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s much better, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha just gritted her teeth at Tae Ho\u2019s question. Merlin was taking deep breaths next to then with a strange rhythm.</p><br/><p>The warriors that were riding the Rain of Steel for the first time screamed out in fear and joy, and the warriors that had used them several times cheered as if they were riding amidst a glorious parade.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho grabbed Adenmaha\u2019s hand and took a deep breath. As soon as they landed, battle would break out.</p><br/><p>The destination of the steel structure Tae Ho rode on had Kataron as its objective.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho thought of Helga and King Ivar who he hadn\u2019t seen for a long time, and Merlin was also putting a different expression than usual as he also had deep connections with Kataron.</p><br/><p>\u2018Rather than that, isn\u2019t it because of the Rain of Steel?\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho ignored Cuchulainn\u2019s words and thought of Siri and Bracky. He didn\u2019t know where they were headed to, but it would be fine if it were them. Tae Ho was rather worried about Ingrid.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will arrive soon! Shut your mouths and get ready!\u201d</p><br/><p>A voice of the Valkyrie was heard from the other side. He didn\u2019t know which legion she belonged to, but she was full of charisma.</p><br/><p>\u2018If we mix Reginleif and Gandur, will it be similar to her?\u2019</p><br/><p>Time still flowed while Tae Ho thought of strange things, and finally, the Rain of Steel crashed onto the ground. Shock and adrenaline swept through the group as the heavy door swung open with the groan of the warriors.</p><br/><p>At that moment, screams and cries were heard.</p><br/><p>Roar and cheers covered the sky and the ground.</p><br/><p>It was truly the middle of a battlefield. The giants and the evil spirits were destroying the castle and the city. The warriors of Kataron were fighting desperately and buying time for the citizens to escape.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Asgard and the Nine Realms!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Asgard and the Nine Realms!\u201d</p><br/><p>The warriors of Valhalla roared and charged. The number of warriors that poured out of the steel structures were more than a hundred. Most of them were lowest or inferior-ranked warriors, but they were still much stronger than the warriors of Kataron.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho acted calmly. The only superior-ranked warrior deployed at the region of Kataron was himself. The Valkyrie was the one who commanded the troops but even so, he couldn\u2019t act by his own.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho was the tactical weapon in this battle. He had to intervene effectively in the place that needed him the most.</p><br/><p>\u201cRolo! McLaren!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho used the summoning rocks for the first time in a long while. McLaren, who erupted from deep beneath the ground, charged towards the castle. He became a barrier against the giants and evil spirits to replace the already broken defences.</p><br/><p>Rolo flew up instead of carrying Tae Ho, and he activated a saga for him.</p><br/><p>[Saga: Owner of Flames]</p><br/><p>The red dragon, Shooting Star, who\u2019d first contracted with the Dragon Knight, Kalsted.</p><br/><p>Rolo transformed into a strong dragon and flew directly into the void from which the evil spirits poured from and burned them with a rain of fire.</p><br/><p>\u201cAdenmaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCall me whenever you need me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha transformed into a sea serpent and charged alone into the battlefield just like Rolo had done. She spat icy breath and became another obstacle between the fleeing citizens and the evil spirits.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho clambered down the steel structures with Merlin. He used rune magic which he\u2019d learned from Cuchulainn and looked down at the battlefield from his vantage point.</p><br/><p>Kataron was already half burnt. The number of the knights of Kataron he counted with his \u2018Eyes of the Dragon\u2019 weren\u2019t even a sixth of the original number.</p><br/><p>The number of the giants and evil spirits were about a thousand. Most of them were evil spirits, but there were three giants among them. It was obvious that they couldn\u2019t be stopped with the strength of mere humans.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho pulled out Caladbolg and was about to fire lightning towards the harpies covering the skies.</p><br/><p>But at that moment, something entered Tae Ho\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>[The Dying]</p><br/><p>[Princess of Kataron]</p><br/><p>[Helga]</p><br/><p>Tae Ho gritted his teeth. He activated the \u2018Warrior that had a Valkyrie Meet Him\u2019 to summon the fake Heda and seven more and ordered them to face the harpies. He left the fake Valkyries behind and charged towards Helga.</p><br/><p>There were many evil spirits in his path. The race that had dog and pig heads charged towards Tae Ho fearlessly.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho pressed himself down as anger boiled in his soul. His fast, precise sword techniques were executed in brutal fashion instead of firing the lightning from Caladbolg.</p><br/><p>Caladbolg split the air.</p><br/><p>The stroke of his sword became a vicious gale that swept up the battlefield before him.</p><br/><p>The wind shattered.</p><br/><p>The evil spirits which charged towards Tae Ho fell in an instant. Their lower and upper bodies were separated and rolled separately along the ground.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho charged between them and the horrified evil spirits scattered at the overwhelming difference in power.</p><br/><p>\u201cHelga!\u201d</p><br/><p>Helga, who was leaning on a half-broken wall, fell down. There was a coarse sword that the evil spirits used stuck in her chest. Her entire body was covered with wounds, and blood flowed freely down her red-stained clothes.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun\u2019s\u2026\u2026wa\u2026rrior-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>Helga smiled and said. It seemed like her voice would fade at any moment, and her eyes were without focus.</p><br/><p>\u201cHelga\u2026.fought\u2026.hard\u2026..she\u2019s\u2026.not\u2026..emb\u2026.arr..\u201d</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t speak properly. Tae Ho laid down Helga and spoke urgently.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou did well. You did well Helga, so relax as I have come. The warriors of Valhalla have come.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m gla\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Helga\u2019s smile lost strength even more. Tae Ho hurriedly used a recovery rune, but it had no effect.</p><br/><p>Because the recovery rune merely amplified one\u2019s recovery power. If one used it on a warrior of Valhalla that had transcendent health and recovery rate, they would be able to heal them even from the brink of death, but Helga was but a common human.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho instantly took out a piece of a golden apple but Merlin, who\u2019d arrived a bit late, held him back. It was because it was already too late.</p><br/><p>Helga\u2019s body started to cool down. It was still warm, but it was only for a moment.</p><br/><p>The Princess of Kataron, Helga.</p><br/><p>She had become a faithful follower of Idun after having been rescued by Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>She stood on the front lines even though she was a mortal princess and lost her life for the citizens. She put a strengthless smile and faced her end.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho gritted his teeth. He breathed out roughly and closed Helga\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Merlin put on a dumbfounded face beside him. It wasn\u2019t because he\u2019d gotten shocked at her death.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy King\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Merlin pulled on Tae Ho\u2019s arm. Tae Ho, who was about to mourn Helga, looked back at Merlin with an angry face, but Merlin didn\u2019t mind that and pointed to the sky.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho also looked up and put the same face as Merlin.</p><br/><p>He saw a half materialized Valkyrie up there and saw Helga next to her.</p><br/><p>\u2018I will wait for you in the residence!\u2019</p><br/><p>She looked down at Tae Ho and her own corpse and spoke brightly. The Valkyrie that was next to her smiled awkwardly upon seeing the astonished faces of Tae Ho and Merlin and then waved her hand before returning to Valhalla with Helga.</p><br/><p>\u2018You get dumb at times like this.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn said in a low voice.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho also felt the same.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2026.it turned out well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Merlin\u2019s words stumbled out. Thinking about it, he was right. Because it wasn\u2019t easy to enter Valhalla.</p><br/><p>But still, she had died. Tae Ho looked down at the corpse of Helga with a complicated feeling. He was hoping that she could live a happy life and then come to Valhalla.</p><br/><p>He laid down Helga\u2019s corpse, who bore a deeply content expression, and then stood up.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t guaranteed that all warriors would enter Valhalla like Helga, and it wasn\u2019t said that it would give happy results for them.</p><br/><p>He had to rescue at least one more warrior. He had to save the powerless citizens of Kataron.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s coming.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn said.</p><br/><p>A giant with a strong aura was approaching them from the distance.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 35 \u2013 Great War (4) &gt; End</p><hr/><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/><p>Episode 35/Chapter 5: Great War (5)</p><br/><p>TL: Tsubak</p><br/><p>ED: Julsmul</p><hr/><br/><p>The King of Gods, Odin, had an extreme method.</p><br/><p>Deploy the warriors of Valhalla to Midgard after removing the Great Barrier.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t something that couldn\u2019t be understood rationally.</p><br/><p>It was because it was a situation that the soul fragments had to be retrieved at once, and one couldn\u2019t know how much the barrier was damaged.</p><br/><p>Rains of Steel poured down from the sky, and giants and evil spirits surged up from below the ground.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho left Helga\u2019s corpse and glared at the sky. The things that were now pouring down from the sky weren\u2019t only the steel structures. Red words were approaching from a further place.</p><br/><p>They were the giants of Jotunheim. Just like Valhalla could deploy warriors with the Rains of Steel, the giants could also do the same with their burning pillars.</p><br/><p>But they couldn\u2019t do it faster than Valhalla. It was only for now, but there was only one pillar of fire descending on Kataron.</p><br/><p>He would solve it quickly.</p><br/><p>And not delay any longer.</p><br/><p>A picture was drawn in Tae Ho\u2019s head and then he kicked forward. The fake Valkyries gathered next to Tae Ho upon heeding his mental command. Precisely speaking, they stood in front of Tae Ho to charge towards the evil spirits and open up a path.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho saw while running.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha and McLaren were each facing a giant.</p><br/><p>A mere lowest-ranked giant couldn\u2019t endure Adenmaha who had transformed into a sea serpent and was manifesting several mystical powers.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha froze the eyes of the giant by firing an icy breath and then swung her tail to hit his leg. She then stomped on the giant, who fell down, and activated several mystical powers. The giant had his head and vital organs pierced by icy spears and couldn\u2019t even scream.</p><br/><p>McLaren suppressed the giant in a much simpler fashion. He merely climbed up the giant like a vine around a tree and then took him down.</p><br/><p>The reason the knights of Kataron were being pushed back was because of the giants which they could do nothing about with the strength of humans. As the warriors of Valhalla were already eliminating quite a number of evil spirits, they would be able to protect Kataron with just the knights after removing the giants.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho kept running and looked at a distant place. He saw Rolo that was facing the last giant.</p><br/><p>Rolo, who\u2019d transformed into the Master of Flames, Shooting Star, understood the fighting methods instinctively as a born dragon should. He flew sharply like a predator to catch its food to kick him in the chest and made him fall. He then poured out violent attacks on his head. The flaming breath burnt down the head of the giant.</p><br/><p>\u201cRolo!\u201d</p><br/><p>Rolo turned his head at the call of Tae Ho. He checked that he was running to himself and then checked the giant once again. He chewed down his neck roughly as if ensuring the giant\u2019s death and then flew backwards towards Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>[Saga: The Charge of a Warrior is like a Storm]</p><br/><p>Tae Ho kicked the air and surged up. He didn\u2019t send a particular signal, but Rolo understood Tae Ho\u2019s intention with just that. He flew below Tae Ho so that he could ride on him easily.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho landed on Rolo\u2019s back, and at that moment, Rolo fluttered his wings once more. He raised his head while being on top of Rolo that was flying up high. He estimated the time left for the fire pillar to land on the ground and the location.</p><br/><p>[Strengthened Saga]</p><br/><p>[The Eyes of the Dragon see through Everything]</p><br/><p>He estimated the strength of the giant inside the pillar and at the same time read the trajectory the fire pillar was drawing.</p><br/><p>[Saga: The One that Controls Dragons]</p><br/><p>Tae Ho transmitted his thoughts to Rolo. Rolo cursed at the excessive request, but his eyes were smiling.</p><br/><p>The giant inside the fire pillar was an intermediate one. He was weaker than Tae Ho but wasn\u2019t an enemy that could be defeated easily when fought face to face.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why he would save time and take care of him with a single attack!</p><br/><p>Rolo fluttered his wings and flew to a different place instead of the fire pillar. He drew a big trajectory in the air and increased his speed.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a lance charging. It was something else. Tae Ho put back Caladbolg and took a deep breath. He poured all his concentration on controlling Rolo\u2019s flight speed and trajectory.</p><br/><p>The fire pillar pierced the clouds and started to head to the ground while burning the land. It finally let out a big sound and got stuck in the ground.</p><br/><p>And right at that moment-</p><br/><p>Rolo flew low, horizontally. He charged towards the fire pillar.</p><br/><p>[Saga: His Pocket is Connected with a Treasure Vault]</p><br/><p>Tae Ho gripped the air, and at that moment, a huge hilt of a sword was grabbed. Rolo continued to charge forward and Tae Ho pulled out a huge sword from the air as if unsheathing it.</p><br/><p>[Nodachi for Giants]</p><br/><p>[Fragarach\u2019s Prototype]</p><br/><p>Merlin hadn\u2019t remained idle during the time Tae Ho was in the Tower of Shadows. He made a new sword meant to deal with giants as he battled them frequently.</p><br/><p>The fire pillar broke down and the giant appeared while howling. Rolo flew behind that giant just like an arrow trying to pierce its target.</p><br/><p>[Saga: Giant Killer]</p><br/><p>[Saga: The Hammer of the Blacksmith doesn\u2019t Slip Off]</p><br/><p>Light appeared on top of the huge sword that was half pulled from the air. Tae Ho activated the sentence of the Milesians and completely pulled it out while roaring. It was a really huge sword where only the hilt was 1 meter long and the blade was 7 meters long.</p><br/><p>The fire pillar broke down completely and the giant tried to roar as if to announce its presence, but the huge sword reached the neck of that giant a second later. It slashed his neck even before he could open his mouth!</p><br/><p><i>Chkwaaaak!</i></p><br/><p>Blood spurted out, but it didn\u2019t reach Tae Ho. It was because of the speed Rolo flew at as they was charging. He fluttered his wings to increase their height, and Tae Ho looked at the ground while holding the huge sword. The head of the giant got separated from its body and was rolling on the ground.</p><br/><p>The warriors of Valhalla couldn\u2019t understand instantly what had happened. Because everything ended while they blinked a few times after the fire pillar descended.</p><br/><p>Because of that, they needed some time. A few more seconds of silence had to be added to it. Rolo turned in the air completely and only then did the cheer explode in the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun\u2019s warrior!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDragon knight!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho didn\u2019t ignore those cheers. He put back his huge sword and then scattered the magic powder he took out. And then, the shape of a golden apple tree appeared behind him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGoddess of Youth!\u201d</p><br/><p>The warriors went wild once again. Adenmaha laughed, and Cuchulainn feigned a laugh as if it was absurd.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bragi\u2019s rune is meaningless here.\u2019</p><br/><p>In the first place, it didn\u2019t have much place to intervene in Tae Ho\u2019s promotion.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho looked at a distant place. The half materialized Valkyries were leading the souls of the warriors to Valhalla. It seemed like they were lacking in numbers as several battles occurred at the same place that they were carrying several warriors, and most of them were apprentice Valkyries.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho relaxed when he found Helga among them. He then checked the land and inspected the situation.</p><br/><p>There were still many evil spirits remaining in Kataron, but the situation had changed completely. The evil spirits that witnessed the giants\u2019 defeat in front of them fled in consecution rather than continuing to battle.</p><br/><p>Because of that, Tae Ho looked away from Kataron and peered into a farther place.</p><br/><p>In the first place, the reason superior-ranked warriors descended everywhere in a scattered way wasn\u2019t only to face the giants and evil spirits. No matter what the warriors thought, the most important thing Valhalla had determined was retrieving the soul fragments.</p><br/><p>They guessed that there would be four soul fragments in Midgard.</p><br/><p>A catastrophe could occur if even one of them fell in the hands of the giants.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho first looked at the winter tree forest. There was a low probability that it would be there as a soul fragment had already appeared there in the past, but he didn\u2019t come to a hasty conclusion. It was because there was no way a superior-ranked warrior would have been dispatched to a place that had no probabilities to have Garmr\u2019s soul fragment in it.</p><br/><p>[Strengthened Saga]</p><br/><p>[The Eyes of the Dragon See through Everything]</p><br/><p>He flew towards the winter tree forest and concentrated. There were shining words deep in the forest that still couldn\u2019t recover completely from the wound of the past. It was certainly a soul fragment of Garmr.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho transmitted his thought to Rolo once again and he started to fly towards the forest.</p><br/><p>But it was at that moment that the voice of Adenmaha rang in his head.</p><br/><p>\u2018Master! It\u2019s approaching!\u2019</p><br/><p>It was a magical message. Tae Ho raised his head in response. He still couldn\u2019t feel it well, but as soon as he activated the mystical power that strengthened his eyesight, he could see what Adenmaha was speaking about.</p><br/><p>They were fire pillars, several of them this time. In addition, one of them was so big it couldn\u2019t be compared to the others.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho released his mystical power and judged quickly.</p><br/><p>It was impossible with just Tae Ho alone. Now that Garmr\u2019s soul fragment was here, it was highly probable that the giants would keep attacking.</p><br/><p>\u201cAdenmaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho yelled. It would have been normal not to have heard it properly because of the long distance, but Adenmaha understood it in an instant. She transformed into a Goddess once again and transmitted her thought to Merlin with her mystical power.</p><br/><p>Merlin recited a chant. It was magic that transmitted news to Valhalla.</p><br/><p>A soul fragment of Garmr has been discovered, so dispatch superior-ranked warriors or above that are in reserve.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho continued acting. It was to prepare to retrieve Garmr\u2019s soul fragment as he still had time before the fire pillars descended completely.</p><br/><p>[Saga: Idun\u2019s Warrior]</p><br/><p>[Saga: King of Camelot]</p><br/><p>Tae Ho activated his sagas in consecution. It was to prepare to fight against the giants as a great battle would unleash as soon as the fire pillars descended.</p><br/><p>\u2018My warrior, Tae Ho.\u2019</p><br/><p>Idun\u2019s voice was heard. He could hear her voice clearly just like when he activated his saga in other places, probably because the Great Barrier had been removed.</p><br/><p>\u2018He\u2019s a superior-ranked giant or above. Perhaps, he may be an existence similar to the Giant of Earth you faced before.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn spoke quickly. They could now see the fire pillars clearly even without activating their mystical powers.</p><br/><p>\u2018They said that they\u2019ll depart immediately!\u2019</p><br/><p>Adenmaha\u2019s voice was heard in his head clearly. It seemed like a reply had come from Valhalla.</p><br/><p>Rolo also reached the winter tree forest as the fire pillars were descending there instead of Kataron.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho could feel Idun\u2019s anxiousness. He felt like he could see her putting on a worried expression and clenching her chest.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho kicked Rolo\u2019s back and they headed to the ground while kicking off the air. He looked at the soul fragment of Garmr that was emanating a dreary aura in the middle of the trees. It was a big claw of a beast that was stuck in the ground.</p><br/><p>Rolo cried and urged Tae Ho. it was because the fire pillars had gotten closer.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho hurriedly used the divine power of Idun to try to retrieve the soul fragment.</p><br/><p>But it was at that moment.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tae Ho!\u2019</p><br/><p>Idun yelled hurriedly. Tae Ho could guess what Idun had seen and had gotten surprised at because they were connected with \u2018Idun\u2019s Warrior\u2019. There was someone standing among the trees and looking at him.</p><br/><p>He was someone that Tae Ho had met for the first time.</p><br/><p>But he could know the moment he saw him.</p><br/><p>Idun let out an enraged roar.</p><br/><p>\u2018Loki!\u2019</p><br/><p>The God of Fire and Lies, Loki.</p><br/><p>He was standing there in the open, and that fact made Idun both enraged and fearful at the same time.</p><br/><p>The fire pillars were already descending, but Loki appeared in front of them.</p><br/><p>Idun yelled at Tae Ho to escape and tried to buy some time even if she ended up expending a lot of her divine power at once.</p><br/><p>But Tae Ho didn\u2019t move. He stopped Idun that was about to release her divine power and looked at Loki.</p><br/><p>[The God of Fire and Lies]</p><br/><p>[Loki]</p><br/><p>He could only see his name and nothing besides that. The current Tae Ho could only read his name clearly.</p><br/><p>But that wasn\u2019t all. That\u2019s why he stopped Idun.</p><br/><p>His words weren\u2019t red.</p><br/><p>The words that appeared on top of the head of Loki were green!</p><br/><p>How?</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t find an answer. He lacked time to do so.</p><br/><p>Loki looked at Tae Ho and saw through Tae Ho\u2019s \u2018Eyes of the Dragon\u2019 like Heda had done previously. Because of that, he placed his right index finger to his lips instead of saying anything.</p><br/><p>He looked at Tae Ho, requesting him to stay silent.</p><br/><p>\u2018Stay silent, as it\u2019s not the time right now.\u2019</p><br/><p>Idun couldn\u2019t understand. She thought that Loki was lying Tae Ho with his specialty of trickery and fabrication.</p><br/><p>\u2018Master!\u2019</p><br/><p>Adenmaha yelled and Tae Ho raised his head. Rolo was crying out as if telling him to hop on with haste. He could see the fire pillars that seemed like they would cover the ground at any moment.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho looked at Loki and Loki faced him and hit his chest twice with a fist.</p><br/><p>For Asgard and the Nine Realms.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tae Ho!\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho made a decision. He released Idun\u2019s divine power to seal Garmr\u2019s soul fragment. He then charged in the air and surged up.</p><br/><p>[One of the Five Fingers]</p><br/><p>[Giant of Beasts]</p><br/><p>[Ortr]</p><br/><p>The fire pillars descended on the forest.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 35 \u2013 Great War (5) &gt; End</p><hr/><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/><p>Episode 35/Chapter 6: Great War (6)</p><br/><p>TL: Tsubak</p><br/><p>ED: Julsmul</p><hr/><br/><p>Idun remembered the Great War.</p><br/><p>She kept looking at it through the piece of memory she couldn\u2019t erase.</p><br/><p>The death of the previous Idun and Bragi.</p><br/><p>The last, desperate battle of Idun\u2019s legion that didn\u2019t even leave a single lowest-ranked warrior alive and ended with its heroic death.</p><br/><p>If the great Viking King, Ragnar Lodbrok, hadn\u2019t been able to arrive on time, a new Idun wouldn\u2019t exist right now. Idun\u2019s legion also couldn\u2019t continue existing.</p><br/><p>Because of that, Idun couldn\u2019t trust in Loki. Because he was the one that had betrayed the Gods of Asgard when the war was coming to an end. He was a monster that betrayed his brother, Thor, and stabbed behind the King of Gods, Odin.</p><br/><p>Loki had several offspring, but the most famous among them were the three that were born between Angrboda.</p><br/><p>The World Wolf, Fenrir, that would lead to the end of the world.</p><br/><p>The huge Space Snake, Jormungand, who dwarfed even the most massive giants.</p><br/><p>Hela, who lived all the moments from when she was born to when she died at the same time.</p><br/><p>Each one of them were a world-ending calamity.</p><br/><p>Although Hela was sided with Asgard, it was different for the other two.

The treacherous God of Lies had tricked Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>But it was a situation that she couldn\u2019t yell or tell him to think it twice.</p><br/><p>Idun saw it through Tae Ho.

The moment he kicked the air to get on Rolo\u2019s back, two fire pillars hit the ground, and fire surged up with a loud roar. Intermediate-ranked giants appeared from within the black smoke that followed.</p><br/><p>The winter tree forest quickly burned down as Adenmaha and Merlin were approaching from far away while riding on McLaren.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho raised his head. He erased his thoughts about Loki and looked at the front.</p><br/><p>[Giant of Beasts]</p><br/><p>[Ortr]</p><br/><p>\u2018We will buy time until reinforcements come. Just think about that.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn said quickly. Actually, the right answer in this situation was to escape. Even if Tae Ho had gotten stronger, it was impossible to face the Giant of Beasts, a foe comparable to the Giant of Earth, and also a big group of intermediate-ranked giants at the same time!</p><br/><p>But if Tae Ho fell back here, only destruction was fated for Kataron.</p><br/><p>In addition, the giants would be able to acquire the soul fragment without any obstructions.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn didn\u2019t tell him to escape. It was because he knew Tae Ho too well.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho wouldn\u2019t retreat, and even if Cuchulainn told him to do so, he would stay back and fight.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why Cuchulainn didn\u2019t regret choosing Tae Ho as Erin\u2019s successor.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s go!\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn yelled out, and Tae Ho transmitted his thought to Rolo.</p><br/><p>Rolo flew up towards the burning pillar that was descending with an overwhelming speed. It was to aim for the moment the fire pillar descended and attack it just like he had done so for the intermediate giant.</p><br/><p>Two trajectories were drawn in the sky.</p><br/><p>Both paths contained funnels of roaring flames.</p><br/><p>Rolo took a big turn and Tae Ho kept analyzing the trajectory of the fire pillar, and after a moment, he hurriedly gave an order to Rolo.</p><br/><p>\u201cDodge!\u201d</p><br/><p>The trajectory of the fire pillar twisted. It exploded in the air even though it hadn\u2019t reached the ground yet, and someone appeared from the remnants of the fire pillar and charged towards Rolo.</p><br/><p>It was a giant that had the head of a lion and the wings of an eagle. The giant that had nails of a dragon split the air and fell.</p><br/><p>Rolo tried to dodge him, but it wasn\u2019t easy to twist his body in the middle of a flight. In addition, the giant was extremely fast.</p><br/><p>Ortr\u2019s fist hit the air, but the effects were enough. Rolo\u2019s body shook even though the attack had missed him, and the gale created by his fist messed up Rolo\u2019s flight.</p><br/><p>Rolo crashed on the ground. Ortr also couldn\u2019t do anything about the descending speed and fell to the earth as well.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho hurriedly kicked the air. He had jumped from Rolo\u2019s back the moment Ortrs\u2019 fist missed him and then threw himself towards Ortr that had landed in a messed up way due to having changed directions in the air.</p><br/><p>[Saga: His Pocket is Connected to a Treasure Vault]</p><br/><p>Tae Ho took out Fragarach\u2019s prototype once more from the air. He tried to strike Ortr\u2019s head along the descending speed.</p><br/><p>But Ortr reacted with ease. He, who had risen up before Tae Ho\u2019s attack hit him, was much faster than the Giant of Earth. He hurriedly raised his arms to block Tae Ho\u2019s attack.</p><br/><p><i>Kakang!</i></p><br/><p>The prototype of Fragarach collided with the steel protectors Ortr bore upon his forearms, and a loud explosion resonated from the impact.</p><br/><p>Ortr groaned for a moment and then swung his arm roughly. Tae Ho dropped Fragarach\u2019s prototype without regrets and entrusted his body to the force behind his attack. He was tossed into the air and then transformed into a hawk to regain his bearings.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun\u2019s warrior!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ortr yelled. He spread his massive wings of an eagle and surged up.</p><br/><p>The strength behind each stroke of his wings was so strong that all the trees in the forest shook. It was certain that Tae Ho wouldn\u2019t be able to beat him in speed, so he transformed back into a human and vaulted through the air to enter his reach.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuickly! Quicker!\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha urged while riding on McLaren. The winter tree forest was burning up entirely. She could see about five huge giants from within, and the biggest and strongest one was battling Tae Ho in the air.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha felt like her heart would explode. She panted without being able to calm her rough breath and yelled,</p><br/><p>\u201cIs the reinforcement far away?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cValhalla replied. Reinforcements will come soon!\u201d</p><br/><p>Merlin, who was beside Adenmaha, answered her frantic question. He was also as anxious as Adenmaha but the number of battlefields he had been through was different to hers. He looked at the battlefield with calm eyes on top of McLaren that was charging with all his speed.</p><br/><p>Perhaps, it was a more desperate situation than with the Giant of Earth.</p><br/><p>Because back then, the Giant of Earth was alone, and he had Bracky and Siri by his side.</p><br/><p>However, Merlin didn\u2019t get discouraged. The training received in the Tower of Shadows had made Tae Ho strong. One could dismiss it as a mere two years, but those two years were everything but ordinary</p><br/><p>The strongest warrior of Erin, Cuchulainn, had guided Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>The martial arts of Scathach, which had created lots of heroes, were carved into Tae Ho\u2019s being.</p><br/><p>He\u2019d also experienced desperate battles. His opponents weren\u2019t ordinary but were the heroes of Erin that had learned Scathach\u2019s style of techniques.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why it was fine. He would be able to endure it.</p><br/><p>Even if it was an emergency situation and they lacked hands, Valhalla wouldn\u2019t be picky on reinforcements now that one of the Five Fingers had appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will entrust you with the protection!\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha yelled as soon as they approached the winter tree forest. She stood up from his seat and then jumped away from McLaren\u2019s head. She flew for a moment with the mystical power of the Tuatha De Danann and then transformed into a sea serpent.</p><br/><p>Sea serpents were a draconic race that had the sea as their headquarters. As a result, battling on a dry stretch of land didn\u2019t suit them, much less a burning one.</p><br/><p>But Adenmaha didn\u2019t hesitate even a little bit. As soon as she transformed into a sea serpent, she fired icy breath to the closest intermediate-ranked giant and then used strong mystical powers in consecution as if she wouldn\u2019t save energy.</p><br/><p>Ice swords and spears poured towards the giant. McLaren yelled something in the excitement, and Merlin jumped up from McLaren and recited a chant. He was planning to use the fire as it spread all over the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cFire snake!\u201d</p><br/><p>The flames started to wave following the trajectory Merlin\u2019s staff drew. It started to gather and form a whirlpool before becoming a huge snake of fire that attacked the giants.</p><br/><p>McLaren didn\u2019t stay still either. He slammed into the giants that were trying to attack Adenmaha with all his strength and then tore at the necks of the giants who had lost their balance and fallen.</p><br/><p>A battle between giants and monsters occurred on the ground, and Tae Ho and Ortr battled in the air.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho knew how he had to fight against a giant. The difference in bodies meant that the distance he could execute an attack was also different.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho closed the distance with Ortr. Precisely speaking, he only tried to fight above him and in addition, he didn\u2019t stop his movements.</p><br/><p>Still, it wasn\u2019t an easy thing to do because Ortr was well aware that such a battle was disadvantageous to him. Additionally, they weren\u2019t on the ground, but in the air right now.</p><br/><p>Ortr moved his body rashly without resting to prevent Tae Ho from approaching him, and when even a little bit of distance was created, he poured out attacks at twisted angles. He was a giant that was closer to being a beast rather than a warrior.</p><br/><p>Ortr\u2019s nails split the air once more. Tae Ho twisted his body in the air to dodge the attack and then clung to his wrist and activated a saga.</p><br/><p>[Saga: Warrior\u2019s Equipment]</p><br/><p>[Saga: Warrior\u2019s Equipment]</p><br/><p>The several weapons Kalsted used poured towards Ortr. As there was the difference in size and the strength behind it was weak as he had thrown it quickly, one couldn\u2019t completely ignore it. It was because each weapon displayed their unique effects.</p><br/><p>The Executioner\u2019s sword created a bleeding effect. He created a small wound, and the Vein Blade that passed over it emanated a nasty poison and affected Ortr.</p><br/><p>The sword of lightning, Lightning Edge, flew towards Ortr\u2019s eye. It struck out with a powerful jolt of electricity that took out Ortr\u2019s vision for a moment.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho reached his shoulder in an instant and then Ortr hit his own shoulder with his palm. Tae Ho barely threw his body back to dodge the attack and then grabbed Arondight, the sword of Lancelot, and activated a saga one more time.</p><br/><p>[Saga: The Warrior that had a Valkyrie Meet Him]</p><br/><p>The fake Valkyries spread and divided Ortr\u2019s eyes and consciousness. There were ten Valkyries, as he\u2019d called everyone excluding Freya.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho stabbed behind Ortr\u2019s neck and he let out a roar instead of screaming in pain. The blade of sound, that could be perceived as being a sort of magic, hacked at the fake Valkyries, and a lot of them poured down, especially on Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>They were soundwave swords that weren\u2019t visible to the naked eye, but Tae Ho could see their trajectories. He read all of them with his \u2018Eyes of the Dragon\u2019 and swung Arondight. He executed a Wind split once and pushed away all the blades of sound.</p><br/><p>But it was impossible to stay in his place. It was because Ortr had released a strong aura throughout his body.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho hurriedly kicked his neck and threw himself in the air. At that moment, Ortr quickly turned his body and opened his mouth towards Tae Ho. Flames that wouldn\u2019t fall behind to the breath of a dragon were spontaneously fired from his mouth.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho gritted his teeth and swung his sword once more and then split the flames with the sword of wind. At that moment, the flames of a real dragon covered Ortr.</p><br/><p>It was the flame spat by Rolo from below.</p><br/><p>Ortr hurriedly covered himself with his wings of an eagle. He roared in fury and subsequently fired blades of sound once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun\u2019s warrior! Idun\u2019s warrior!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho didn\u2019t charge towards the blades of sound. He covered himself with a large round shield made from his \u2018Warrior\u2019s Equipment\u2019 and entrusted his body to gravity. Rolo surged up and caught Tae Ho on his back.</p><br/><p>Rolo first distanced himself from Ortr and Tae Ho breathed roughly and panted.</p><br/><p>Idun\u2019s divine power covered Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>It certainly wasn\u2019t easy. Just looking at the battle from outside, it seemed like Tae Ho was pouring attacks one sidedly, but he couldn\u2019t inflict a fatal wound on him. In addition, just battling the Giant of Beasts consumed a lot of his strength and concentration.</p><br/><p>Rolo took a big turn. Ortr spread his wings once again and then prepared to fly.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho looked down at Ortr and extended his hand to the air. He called out the name of the weapon that would replace Arondight.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Gunlance of the Royal Dragon!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was one of the huge spears the Dragon Knight, Kalsted, used in Dark Age.</p><br/><p>In the first place, it was a weapon meant to be used while riding a dragon, so this spear was much bigger than the ones Tae Ho had used until now.</p><br/><p>The Gunlance of the Royal Dragon, that could only be forged after one defeated a black dragon covered with lava, was black and red. The red and yellow lines on its black surface emanated a light akin to lava flowing down a volcano, and it had the head of a dragon as a decoration suitable of the name Gunlance.</p><br/><p>The blades made with fangs of a black dragon proclaimed its strong presence with a stout aura. It was currently the strongest weapon Tae Ho could recreate from Dark Age.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, Rolo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho spoke curtly. Rolo fluttered his wings once and charged towards Ortr by his command. Ortr also flew towards Tae Ho as if his victory was all but uncertain.</p><br/><p>And it was at that moment that Merlin, who was facing the intermediate-ranked giants on the ground, looked at the sky. He saw the objects that were pouring down beyond Ortr and Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>They were the Black Flashes. There wasn\u2019t only one structure that held superior-ranked warriors, but three.</p><br/><p>Loki also saw that. He, who was standing in the burning forest, rolled his fingers in a casual manner.</p><br/><p>The Giant of Beasts, Ortr, was fighting in front of him.</p><br/><p>And the Giant of the Night, Avalt, and the Giant of the Sea, Grund, were both also in Midgard.</p><br/><p>There weren\u2019t only the Five Fingers. The superior giants that were in Jotunheim were leading their underlings and descending on Midgard.</p><br/><p>The King of the frost giants, Warrior King Harmarti, was battling in the front lines. There were small battles everywhere, and the most elite of the forces under the command of Thor and Ullr were preparing to face them.</p><br/><p>It really was a dogfight. The ones that had their names spread far away were all fighting their own battles.</p><br/><p>Because of that, Loki felt that it was time.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet everything go as the King wishes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loki said in a low voice. He looked at Tae Ho and Ortr that were clashing in the sky. The ground and the sky shook at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>Freya, who was pouring all her strength into the creation of the new Great Barrier, raised her head. Her hair stuck to her forehead because her entire body was covered in sweat.</p><br/><p>But Freya couldn\u2019t think of fixing her appearance. She blinked a few times with a dumbfounded expression and then let out a bewildered voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cOdin?\u201d</p><br/><p>The King of Gods, Odin. The one that had to command all the battles occurring in the ground.</p><br/><p>His throne was empty.</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t see Odin. He was gone.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 35 \u2013 Great War (6) &gt; End</p><hr/><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/>\n</div>"}

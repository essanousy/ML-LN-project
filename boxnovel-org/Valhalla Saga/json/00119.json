He looked just like someone that was having a nightmare, as his body was completely sweaty.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a peculiar scream.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPant\u2026.Pant\u2026.Cuchulainn?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho\u2019s breathing was ragged as he turned his head. He could see Cuchulainn snickering.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you alright? Do you remember something?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn sat next to Tae Ho and threw a question. Tae Ho faced Cuchulainn with an absent-minded face but then looked at himself in a surprised way.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way! I passed out even though I have Idun\u2019s blessing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Idun\u2019s blessing hadn\u2019t let go of Tae Ho\u2019s consciousness even when Tae Ho was at the verge of death.</p><br/><p>But now, he had passed out so cleanly even though he had Idun\u2019s blessing.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn faced Tea Ho\u2019s shock and then placed his hand on his shoulder as if it was fun.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it fortunate? If you hadn\u2019t passed out, it would have been more painful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s true but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Those were truthful words, but he didn\u2019t want to agree to it.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn patted Tae Ho\u2019s shoulders again.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut hey, you still endured it for quite a long time. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen someone faint after enduring it for a long time like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The majority lost their consciousness as soon as they started.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho opened his eyes sharply at the compliment that wasn\u2019t a compliment and threw a question with a sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut still, it does have an effect right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course there\u2019s an effect. Being able to speak with face to face is proof of that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Now that I see\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho looked at his surroundings. It wasn\u2019t the residence of Scathach, but Cuchulainn had a profoundly clearer shape.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, this isn\u2019t the real world. It\u2019s the imaginary world of master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn stood up and looked at his surroundings. The world was dyed in ash gray and was covered by a big shadow.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can say that it\u2019s another Land of Darkness. Even though Erin was destroyed, the Land of Darkness\u2026that world still remains.\u201d</p><br/><p>An incomplete world that was between the boundary of life and death.</p><br/><p>Erin was destroyed, but the Land of Darkness still remained. Scathach had lost her people and country, but she was still the queen of that land.</p><br/><p>The reason Scathach was one of the best magicians in Erin wasn\u2019t because she had mastered several destructive or offensive magics.</p><br/><p>Even though she was a Milesian, she was versed in the mystical powers of the Tuatha De Danann. She could naturally use the several wonders only the strong Gods of the Tuatha De Danann could use as if she were breathing.</p><br/><p>In Erin, a magician wasn\u2019t someone that fought.</p><br/><p>They were the protectors and transmitters of knowledge and wonders.</p><br/><p>But of course, if great magicians like Merlin or Scathach fought in a magical region after taking enough preparations, the story changed. Cuchulainn usually thought of Scathach as someone he had to protect, but he didn\u2019t even think of that inside of the magical region of Scathach.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn looked down on Tae Ho and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cListen well, Tae Ho. All the theories of the weapon techniques have been injected into your mind and body, but you aren\u2019t able to use them freely as they\u2019ve just been engraved. If you want to use them properly, you will have to learn with your body.\u201d</p><br/><p>What Scathach did to Tae Ho was simple.</p><br/><p>It took a long time to teach him the techniques one by one, so she forcefully engraved them in his body and mind.</p><br/><p>It obviously wasn\u2019t an easy process and couldn\u2019t be repeated easily.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho felt pain like his bones and flesh were torn apart. Tae Ho had been pushed to the brink of death several times in battles against the giants, but this time was the worst. He couldn\u2019t recall much that was more painful than this.</p><br/><p>It was a process all the disciples of Scathach had to go through.</p><br/><p>Because of that, Cuchulainn felt a sense of sympathy and pointed to a distant place with his chin.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe tower you see over there is the Tower of Shadows. It has several floors in it, and there are floor masters protecting each floor. Defeat them and climb the tower. Every time you pass through a floor, you will be able to master one technique of Scathach\u2019s.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Tae Ho turned his head, he saw a big tower. It was a common, pillar-type tower, but it was so high one wasn\u2019t able to see its peak.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs master connected her imaginary world with your mind, you won\u2019t be able to completely use your saga. You won\u2019t be able to use the sagas that borrow external power like \u2018Idun\u2019s Warrior\u2019, and if possible, its good if you don\u2019t use the other sagas either as the objective of this tower is to increase your skills. The best thing is to pierce through with just weapon techniques as if head butting into the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if I die when battling against a floor master?\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t think that Scathach would give him a soft and easy going training by this point.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn shrugged his shoulders at Tae Ho\u2019s question and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, like you would have imagined, you won\u2019t really die in this place. You just have to determine yourself once again and repeatedly challenge it. There\u2019s no need to eat and sleep as its an imaginary world. You will continue fighting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps, it was worse than the myths of Valhalla that repeated endless wars. At least there was time to enjoy oneself after fighting in the myths of Valhalla.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho thought of what he should do and how he should interpret Cuchulainn\u2019s words and then stood up abruptly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, until when?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUntil you give up. You already know what kind of person our master is.\u201d</p><br/><p>He could give up on the first floor and on the tenth floor.</p><br/><p>Only, the things one could gain lessened the earlier they gave up.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn addition, she has already said that she enjoys polishing gemstones into jewels.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUm. Was that polishing in a materialistic way?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn just showed a white smile instead of nodded to his question. He patted Tae Ho\u2019s shoulder with a detached face.</p><br/><p>\u201cCheer up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho turned his eyes and then saw that the door of the Tower of Shadows was opening.</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>Adenmaha bit her lips upon seeing Tae Ho on top of the altar. His condition wasn\u2019t good at all. He was sweating while frowning and even screamed at times.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou witch! What the hell did you do to mast\u2026..kyak!\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha ended up cursing to Scathach as she was nervous but then got her arm twisted and fell to the ground. Scathach rode on top of Adenmaha and twisted her arm even more.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour manners are bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! It hurts! Hurts! I was wrong!\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha begged while crying, but Scathach didn\u2019t let her go easily. She gave her plenty of time so that Adenmaha could engrave the lesson of today in both her body and mind.</p><br/><p>And a few minutes later-</p><br/><p>Scathach let go of Adenmaha\u2019s arm and said while standing up,</p><br/><p>\u201cHe has just started with the training.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha didn\u2019t have the strength to reply at her answer that came with a slow tempo. She sobbed unfairly and then turned to look at Tae Ho and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cHis frowning looks painful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe price you pay is as big as what you gain.\u201d</p><br/><p>Scathach\u2019s philosophy stated that there was no easy thing in the world.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe timeframes of the imaginary world and the real world are different. You can say that it\u2019s a place of time dilation. A month in that place is like a day here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, I think I have heard of something similar from master.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was certainly something that came out in manhwas (mangas).</p><br/><p>While Adenmaha shut her lips and tried to remember, Scathach smirked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou now call him as master really well. It seems like you like him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a- hmph.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha pouted while turning her gaze away. Scathach smiled with her eyes as if Adenmaha was really cute.</p><br/><p>\u201cHedaaa!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho screamed again. Adenmaha turned to look at Tae Ho hurriedly, and Scathach frowned and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like it has started for real.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was something Scathach was quite accustomed to. As a result, she spoke towards Adenmaha, who was uneasy while wiping off Tae Ho\u2019s sweat, in a calm voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell Heda that he will be like this for a few days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know when he will wake up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat depends on his disposition.\u201d</p><br/><p>If he gave up immediately, he would be able to wake up right now, but in the first place, Scathach wouldn\u2019t have used the magic that connected to her imaginary world if Tae Ho was that kind of person.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m quite looking forward\u2026..to what floor he can reach and when he will wake up.\u201d</p><br/><p>She would polish a gemstone and turn it into a jewel.</p><br/><p>Joy appeared in Scathach\u2019s eyes and Adenmaha shrunk down with a scared face.</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cHeda.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda turned around hurriedly at the low call.</p><br/><p>\u201cFreya-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve requested to recruit a Valkyrie.\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya spoke towards Heda who was expressing etiquette gently.</p><br/><p>The place the two people were at was at the dock of Freya\u2019s legion.</p><br/><p>The biggest legion among the several legions in Valhalla didn\u2019t belong to Odin\u2019s nor Thor\u2019s.</p><br/><p>The legion of Freya was located in the center of Valhalla and boasted its great size comparable to several other legions together. Naturally, it had several docks.</p><br/><p>Among them, the one Heda arrived at was the one that was connected with the Valkyrie Training Center.</p><br/><p>Heda put on a nervous face and stiffened because Freya spoke about the reclutation without even greeting her.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be too nervous. It\u2019s also a happy thing for me that Idun\u2019s legion has started to rise up again. I didn\u2019t bring it out to find a fault in it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank\u2026\u2026you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow stiff.\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya laughed at Heda placing her hand on her chest and then closed the distance with her. She looked at the nervous face of Heda up close and then nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have certainly become prettier than before. It seems like your face is shining. I don\u2019t like that Idun\u2019s warrior acted so calmly after seeing me\u2026\u2026but I can only admit this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda didn\u2019t know up to what point Freya was joking.</p><br/><p>Regardless, there was no evil in Freya\u2019s eyes. In addition, Heda could only show an embarrassed smile because of the contents of the conversation.</p><br/><p>Freya giggled. She pinched Heda\u2019s cheek as if the embarrassed Heda was cute and then said,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Valkyries in the Valkyrie Training Center are quite interested in Idun\u2019s legion. They are also really interested in Idun\u2019s warrior. You will be able to get someone that wants to join without much problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t really do anything. It\u2019s thanks to you and the warrior of Idun for having worked so hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>As it were, Idun\u2019s legion was a legion that was quite popular within the Valkyrie Training Center.</p><br/><p>First, the number of Valkyries was low. That meant that a Valkyrie who has just graduated didn\u2019t have that many predecessors.</p><br/><p>Of course, it would be a complete failure if no successors entered, but Idun\u2019s legion had started to rise up completely. The warriors and the Valkyries would increase in an instant.</p><br/><p>There were few predecessors but a lot of successors.</p><br/><p>As there were few Valkyries, if someone entered now, even a greenhorn Valkyrie that had just graduated would be able to take a spot.</p><br/><p>It would be even weirder if it wasn\u2019t popular.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will have to go slowly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya mumbled in a low voice and looked at Heda. She held her hand still and then looked at Heda\u2019s golden eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cSay hello to Idun.\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t her usual, cute voice.</p><br/><p>It was a voice and expression that had the affection of the Goddess of Beauty and Magic.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I will.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda answered while putting on a complicated face, and Freya nodded slowly. She put on a playful smile again and let go of Heda\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Asgard and the Nine Realms.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Asgard and the Nine Realms.\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya hit her abundant chest twice and then turned around. Heda looked at her back for a moment and then let out a long sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cI should return.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were many things to do in the residence.</p><br/><p>Heda hopped on the wooden boat and then steered it towards Idun\u2019s residence.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 32 \u2013 The land of darkness (4) &gt; End</p><br/><p>======</p><header></header><div> Episode 32/Chapter 5: The land of darkness (5)<br/><p>TL: Tsubak</p><br/><p>ED: Julsmul</p><hr/><br/><p>Time flowed.</p><br/><p>One day- two days- fifteen days.</p><br/><p>It was a long and a short time, but there were quite big changes in the residence of Idun.</p><br/><p>The biggest change was the transformation of the population.</p><br/><p>New warriors entered Idun\u2019s legion just like Freya had told them. They numbered twelve in total.</p><br/><p>Adding them to the original five, there were now seventeen lowest-ranked warriors.</p><br/><p>Of course, it was a really embarrassing thing to call just seventeen people a legion, but in the first place, Idun\u2019s legion only had Tae Ho. Compared to before, one could say that it had become exponentially more legion-like.</p><br/><p>Idun followed Tae Ho\u2019s advice and built a big lodging for the warriors. If the original lodging was a hut, then the new one that was built was a huge mansion. It even had three floors so it would be able to accomodate more than a hundred warriors.</p><br/><p>It was a mansion built from thinking of the future.</p><br/><p>Aside from the lodging of the warriors, a training center, smithy, restaurant, and other buildings were also installed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe also built a lodging for the Valkyries.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha mumbled in a low voice in front of the altar where Tae Ho was lying and then smiled shakily.</p><br/><p>\u201cI also have more juniors now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda had obtained Adenmaha as her junior after a hundred years, but Adenmaha obtained two of her own in less than a month.</p><br/><p>Sigrun and Gudrun.</p><br/><p>The two of them were Valkyries that had just graduated from the Valkyrie Training Center.</p><br/><p>Sigrun was a sharp-eyed woman that had a long braid woven with her sea-blue hair. As she was also tall, she gave the impression of a sharp blade when she stood still.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Gudrun gave a soft impression. Her long, brown hair, slightly droopy eyes, and drowsy voice resembled her well. In addition, her body and character were also filled with an aspect of motherly love.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha thought about Gudrun for a moment and then pouted. It wasn\u2019t always good if you were tall.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking about stature. Height.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha said as if she was making an excuse. Actually, it wasn\u2019t that great of an excuse as the two new Valkyries were taller than her.</p><br/><p>Even Gudrun, the shorter one between the two, was taller than Heda. She was around the lower 170cm range, but as she had good proportions, it made her seem taller.</p><br/><p>Sigrun was taller than Gudrun and had reached 180cm. As she also had good proportions, she seemed to be even taller than some warriors if seen from afar.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut the two of them are good people.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because they certainly treated Adenmaha as their senior even though there wasn\u2019t a big difference between them.</p><br/><p>Right now, only Gudrun was in the residence. It was because Sigrun went out to lead warriors in an expedition.</p><br/><p>Originally, it was normal to be led by a Valkyrie of one\u2019s own legion when warriors went out on an expedition. Tae Ho didn\u2019t need a leading Valkyrie as he was had been the only warrior, but it wasn\u2019t the case for the new warriors.</p><br/><p>\u201cRagnar said that it has now become a proper legion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha still chirped about the changes like a baby bird.</p><br/><p>\u201cRolo is almost completely healed. He can\u2019t fly yet, but should I say in a short while? McLaren can also dig into the ground again and is healthy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha spoke up to that point and then laughed. It was because she thought of the warriors that were discussing among themselves as to who would become a gryphon rider by looking at Rolo\u2019s kids.</p><br/><p>There was a big cave in Scathach\u2019s lodging.</p><br/><p>But it wasn\u2019t a bit dark because of the light wards that were emanating light in the ceiling.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha spoke again what she had already said yesterday and the day before and then wiped off the sweat from Tae Ho\u2019s forehead.</p><br/><p>As if on cue, Tae Ho convulsed again.</p><br/><p>\u201cHedaa!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho screamed and began pouring sweat, but it didn\u2019t end there.</p><br/><p>\u201cIduun!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho let a groan after screaming and then gasped with a pained expression.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha breathed in to calm down her surprised heart and then wiped off Tae Ho\u2019s sweat once again. It has already been fifteen days since she first saw this scene, but it didn\u2019t feel like she would get accustomed to it anytime soon.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun! Heda!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho yelled once again, and Adenmaha put on a sulky expression instead of regret.</p><br/><p>\u2018It would be good if he also calls out my name at times.\u2019</p><br/><p>If he screamed ten times, eight or nine of them were Heda\u2019s name and the remaining ones were Idun.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is it because my name is too long?\u2019</p><br/><p>Rather than shouting out \u201cAdenmaha!\u201d, it would be more comfortable to shout Heda or Idun.</p><br/><p>But of course, Adenmaha also knew that it was nonsense.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou play well alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha frowned at the voice that was heard behind her, but she then calmed her breathing and turned around with a business-like expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe already finished with today\u2019s classes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t I roam inside my house like a please?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Scathach stated her argument, Adenmaha could only cower and step back. But she didn\u2019t just step back.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe has only been screaming for fifteen days. Is this working properly?\u201d</p><br/><p>Scathach stood next to the altar and then nodded slowly as Adenmaha grumbled.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, it\u2019s going well. He grew accustomed to it better than I thought.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fifteen days having passed in this world meant that it has already been a year and three months in Tae Ho\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>Looking at it externally, a difference of thirty times existed in the Land of Darkness.</p><br/><p>Because of that, Scathach didn\u2019t really mind Tae Ho\u2019s shouts or pained expression. It was because it was a reaction that showed his overall state and not the actual reaction.</p><br/><p>Screaming, groaning, and panting were basic options for those who trained in the Tower of Shadows. As even the Prince of Light, Cuchulainn, had done so, there were no exceptions.</p><br/><p>Opposingly, Adenmaha put on a bright expression when Scathach said that he was getting accustomed to it well.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs he doing well? Like, is he breaking the record or something?\u201d</p><br/><p>If one looked at Adenmaha still, she looked more like a puppy than a serpent. Scathach looked at Adenmaha\u2019s rear trying to find her waving tail and answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, how can that be? He\u2019s struggling on the lowest floor with the worst speed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those weren\u2019t words to tease Adenmaha. There was no one that was as slow among the ones she had put in the tower.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha put on a disappointed face at Scathach\u2019s words. Scathach looked at her face that showed all of her emotions and then opened her eyes sharply and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s really, really interesting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho was certainly roaming in the lower floors and the speed he conquered the tower was also the slowest.</p><br/><p>However, it was certainly interesting. Not because he was too slow but because of his methods.</p><br/><p>As Scathach\u2019s eyes shone with a conspicuous color, Adenmaha opened her eyes widely as if she was moved with curiously and then looked up at her.</p><br/><p>Scathach just nodded instead of explaining, and Adenmaha pouted once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should tell me or something so I can be interested too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour words are short nowadays.\u201d</p><br/><p>Scathach said while opening her eyes sharply and Adenmaha flinched, but she just played dumb instead of making an excuse or saying that she was sorry. Adenmaha wasn\u2019t someone to forgive that arrogant attitude.</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha, who\u2019d been sitting down, screamed and rolled over. It was because Scathach had performed a cross lock on her.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha screamed once again, but she didn\u2019t beg her to release her or said that she was sorry and instead gritted her teeth.</p><br/><p>As she couldn\u2019t just suffer always.</p><br/><p>A cross lock was something done by a human to another human. Because of that, Adenmaha was thinking of transforming into a sea serpent. She had been enduring it as the place was too narrow and it was burdensome if Scathach got crushed by her, but everything had its limit.</p><br/><p>\u2018She\u2019s a witch, so she will do something about it!\u2019</p><br/><p>Will she die because of that?</p><br/><p>Adenmaha closed her eyes and tried to transform.</p><br/><p>Tried being the operative word.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh- huh? It, it doesn\u2019t work- kyak!\u201d</p><br/><p>The last scream came out instinctively.</p><br/><p>Scathach fixed her lock even tighter and then clicked her tongue and said with a pitiful voice,</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is my residence. Did you think that I would allow you to do what you wanted in the territory of a magician?\u201d</p><br/><p>Strong magicians had the power of a God in their magical territories. Scathach put more strength and Adenmaha couldn\u2019t endure it anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cI- I\u2019m sorry! Ah, hurts! It hurts!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you do wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPo- polite words! I will! Use them! Ugh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFine. Let\u2019s see how you do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Scathach undid the lock and stood up. Even though she had rolled on the ground, she didn\u2019t look at all messy.</p><br/><p>Contrary to her, Adenmaha was in full disarray. She barely stood up again and sat down, but her hair and clothes were a complete mess.</p><br/><p>\u201cSob sob. Uahh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Scathach inspected Tae Ho once again while Adenmaha was sobbing pitifully, and then interest spread over Scathach\u2019s face once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, what is so interesting?\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed like her arm still hurt, for she still had a teary face. Scathach frowned while looking at Adenmaha but didn\u2019t use recovery magic on her. It was to let the pain turn into a lesson.</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, Scathach wasn\u2019t planning on just leaving her alone. Scathach drew a rune in the air and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou will know if you see it directly.\u201d</p><br/><p>What she had been interested in.</p><br/><p>The rune emitted a bright light and then a big window of light spread over Tae Ho\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Cuchulainn\u2019s point of view.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as Scathach finished speaking, a scene appeared from outside the window of light. It was showing Tae Ho and the floor master.</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn was checking the battle between Tae Ho and the floor master with crossed arms.</p><br/><p>They were currently in the eleventh floor.</p><br/><p>He was merely at the eleventh floor after a year and three months, so it was a really slow speed, but Cuchulainn didn\u2019t feel bored but interest just like Scathach.</p><br/><p>The floor master Tae Ho was fighting against currently was one of Scathach\u2019s disciples, Ferdia mac Daman.</p><br/><p>It was a clone instead of the real Ferdia, and his looks and abilities weren\u2019t those of when he was at his peak.</p><br/><p>When he was in his youth- precisely speaking, when Cuchulainn first saw Ferdia mac Daman, his skills matched those of the clone\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho was using a big spear meant to do a lance charge to face the sword-and-shield-bearing Ferdia mac Daman.</p><br/><p>There was obviously no way to fight against him properly. Tae Ho was barely managing to block Ferdia mac Daman\u2019s attacks.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn had already seen their fight more than forty times.</p><br/><p>Ferdia mac Daman\u2019s weapons were always the sword and shield.</p><br/><p>But it was different for Tae Ho. Even though he was most proficient with a sword, the types of weapons he used were much more widespread than a mere spear or axe.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho was clearing the same floor several times.</p><br/><p>After he defeated the floor master with a one-handed sword, he tried again with a two-handed sword. If he won again, he tried once more with a dagger and kept changing his weapons.</p><br/><p>It was a method Cuchulainn had never thought of; perhaps, it was a stupid way. Because he was struggling to learn several weapons when it was hard to even learn one of them properly.</p><br/><p>Actually, Tae Ho had defeated the floor masters quite easily with a sword, but he hadn\u2019t been able to do so with the other weapons.</p><br/><p>\u2018Lil\u2019 bastard.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho had died more than a thousand times the past year and three months. Even though it wasn\u2019t a real death, the pain wasn\u2019t illusory.</p><br/><p>Because the pain one felt when they died was real.</p><br/><p>But Tae Ho didn\u2019t change his strategy. He proceeded with the ignorant method even though he died and kept dying.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, Idun\u2019s warrior indeed.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn had wondered seriously if the ones that received Idun\u2019s blessing started to enjoy pain and became masochists.</p><br/><p>But Cuchulainn didn\u2019t deny Tae Ho\u2019s method.</p><br/><p>He would have stopped him if what Tae Ho was learning was martial arts, but what he was training in right now were Scathach\u2019s techniques.</p><br/><p>The reason Cuchulainn had said Scathach\u2019s spear techniques was because Gae Bolg was the best weapon Tae Ho had, but it wasn\u2019t that he was planning on forcing him to learn spear techniques.</p><br/><p>In addition, Scathach\u2019s techniques weren\u2019t limited to just the spear techniques.</p><br/><p>In normal martial arts, one learned how to use a particular weapon. How to use a sword, how to use a spear, or others.</p><br/><p>But it was different for Scathach\u2019s techniques. It taught the essence more than anything.</p><br/><p>The eyes looking at the fight.</p><br/><p>The moment one clashed their weapon against their opponent\u2019s, they\u2019d experience a normal way to fight, how they should fight, and how their opponent would move.</p><br/><p>Thinking and analyzing was the normal thing.</p><br/><p>But Scathach\u2019s techniques hoped for something beyond that.</p><br/><p>Being able to understand everything just by watching.</p><br/><p>Analyzing more things in a systematized way than thinking and analyzing.</p><br/><p>Eyes that had surpassed any reason.</p><br/><p>And gaining insight through those eyes was the essence of Scathach\u2019s techniques.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t important what weapon one was holding. Just like a warrior of the Temple had said, all streams connected into one. Someone that had realized the essence of Scathach\u2019s techniques could be said to be able of expressing their strength completely through any weapon.</p><br/><p>The Tower of Shadows was a place that made the nature of Scathach\u2019s techniques awaken forcefully.</p><br/><p>And in that meaning, Tae Ho\u2019s way of training suited well with the Tower of Shadows. Battling with various weapons created various aspects.</p><br/><p>In addition, it was also effective on training in the sentence of the Milesians.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho was now able to communicate with the weapons registered in the \u2018Warrior\u2019s Equipment\u2019 and also with the weapons of the Knights of the Round Table.</p><br/><p>Because of that, Cuchulainn and Scathach felt interest in Tae Ho. They didn\u2019t expect that Tae Ho would be able to awaken the essence in an instant, but he would at least be able to approach it.</p><br/><p>And the expectations of the two people weren\u2019t wrong.</p><br/><p>At some point, Tae Ho\u2019s movements had changed.</p><br/><p>It was a change that occurred when one didn\u2019t realize it.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho raised his huge spear, but he hadn\u2019t done so while thinking about it. It was a natural movement which saved his life. The attack that should have originally pierced Tae Ho\u2019s abdomen was parried.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho created some distance with Ferdia mac Daman and then Tae Ho realized a gap in the latter\u2019s defence. He moved his huge spear following him.</p><br/><p>The attack of Ferdia mac Daman missed, and it wasn\u2019t able to even touch Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>A smile appeared in Cuchulainn\u2019s face and Scathach, who was observing with a time difference, put on a similar expression. Adenmaha didn\u2019t know well how the situation was turning but smiled brightly as Tae Ho was fighting well.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho looked at Ferdia mac Daman and understood in that moment.</p><br/><p>The Knights of the Round Table once fought like this. They could see things like this.</p><br/><p>The battle tilted to Tae Ho\u2019s favor and he had started to take the lead. Ferdia mac Daman was in a hurry to block Tae Ho\u2019s attacks.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha clenched her fist and cheered for Tae Ho, but it was different for Cuchulainn and Scathach. The smile in their faces disappeared.</p><br/><p>It was because they could know different from Adenmaha.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho started to stab with his huge spear. It was a stab he had learned on the seventh floor, but it wasn\u2019t completely the same. There were other things mixed in it.</p><br/><p>[Synchro rate: 61%]</p><br/><p>Tae Ho got pushed in swordsmanship against the traitor Mordred and not in strength or speed either. He couldn\u2019t overcome Mordred\u2019s mysterious sword techniques.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho blamed himself for that. He thought that he was at fault for not being able to recreate the sword techniques of Kalsted perfectly, who was the strongest swordsman in the Dark Age.</p><br/><p>[Synchro rate: 62%]</p><br/><p>He became able to execute Kalsted\u2019s sword techniques better than during the battle against Bress the Tyrant. Because of that, he was able to face Bress, who had overwhelmed him in speed, strength, and all the other areas.</p><br/><p>And now he could understand.</p><br/><p>There was a defect in Kasted\u2019s sword techniques.</p><br/><p>A saga was a recreation of a legend.</p><br/><p>Kalsted was the strongest swordsman in Dark Age, but there was no substance to back it up.</p><br/><p>Only the image of the strongest sword technique still remained.</p><br/><p>Shell.</p><br/><p>Sword techniques that only had the external appearance.</p><br/><p>But in this moment, Scathach\u2019s techniques were added to Kalsted\u2019s sword techniques.</p><br/><p>[Synchro rate: 65%]</p><br/><p>The synchro rate increased quickly, but Tae Ho didn\u2019t think of what was happening to him. He just understood it and received it naturally.</p><br/><p>A combination of Kalsted\u2019s sword techniques and Scathach\u2019s techniques.</p><br/><p>What was born from that-</p><br/><p>What was made-</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn opened his eyes widely, and Scathach let out a soft exclamation.</p><br/><p>[Synchro rate: 69%]</p><br/><p>Tae Ho stabbed with his huge spear.</p><br/><p>Ferdia mac Daman couldn\u2019t block Tae Ho\u2019s attacks anymore.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 32 \u2013 The land of darkness (5) &gt; End</p><br/><p>======</p><header></header><div> Episode 32/Chapter 6: The land of darkness (6)<br/><p>TL: Tsubak</p><br/><p>ED: Julsmul</p><hr/><br/><p>One attack.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a flashy attack and there was no light or sound effect. It also wasn\u2019t fast or strong.</p><br/><p>Just stabbing.</p><br/><p>But it was a bit different. The stab Tae Ho had executed couldn\u2019t be compared to the ones he had executed until now.</p><br/><p>Ferdia mac Daman couldn\u2019t parry nor dodge Tae Ho\u2019s attack. He just looked at the huge spear that had pierced his heart with an absent-minded expression and then turned into light and disappeared.</p><br/><p>The fortieth victory.</p><br/><p>If he counted this, then Tae Ho had already won for the fortieth time against Ferdia mac Daman.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho dropped the huge spear and stood still. He closed his eyes naturally and took a deep breath.</p><br/><p>He felt like he could understand.</p><br/><p>He could understand it with the recent battle, albeit not completely.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn and Scathach didn\u2019t explain about Scathach style techniques to Tae Ho in detail. They had told him that he would be able to realize them by himself as the important things were engraved in his body and mind.</p><br/><p>He naturally cursed out as he was the one that would be suffering, but he couldn\u2019t refute it anymore.</p><br/><p>The words of the two people were true.</p><br/><p>He felt like he was learning a type of technique when he had first started to climb the tower.</p><br/><p>Slash like this when you slash.</p><br/><p>Control your strength and speed like this.</p><br/><p>There were quite flashy techniques among them. It wasn\u2019t excessive to say that the consecutive stabs he had learnt in the tenth floor was a kind of an ultimate attack.</p><br/><p>But the essence of Scathach\u2019s style techniques weren\u2019t only that.</p><br/><p>Insight.</p><br/><p>Eyes that let you grasp how you had to move just with looking, how the enemy would move and how will the surroundings change.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho hadn\u2019t completed it yet and had merely entered the early stages, but even with just that, the world Tae Ho saw had completely changed.</p><br/><p>And it didn\u2019t end there.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho opened his eyes slowly. he looked at the huge spear and then imagined the stab he had just executed.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a technique of Scathach\u2019s style.</p><br/><p>It was Kalsted\u2019s stab.</p><br/><p>The sword techniques Tae Ho used until now all belonged to the \u2018Immortal Warrior\u2019.</p><br/><p>The strongest swordsman in the Dark Age, Kalsted.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t have a specific shape. He did know some techniques recreated with his skills, but it wasn\u2019t enough with just that.</p><br/><p>Swordsmanship wasn\u2019t merely a combination of skills.</p><br/><p>With this as fact, Tae Ho didn\u2019t possess the strongest swordsmanship. He had merely displayed somewhat good movements with the image of the strongest swordsman through his saga.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t the case anymore.</p><br/><p>Scathach\u2019s style techniques were added onto Kalsted\u2019s swordsmanship which previously only retained a faint image.</p><br/><p>When it obtained the base of Scathach\u2019s style techniques, Kalsted\u2019s swordsmanship wasn\u2019t a virtual image anymore.</p><br/><p>Scathach\u2019s insights had made that possible.</p><br/><p>The sword techniques of Kalsted who\u2019d lived in the Dark Age which weren\u2019t materialized were different from Tae Ho\u2019s newly made sword techniques.</p><br/><p>The two of them shared the same image of the strongest swordsman, Kalsted. Two versions from the same source.</p><br/><p>A saga was a recreation of reality.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho laughed unconsciously. It was a laughter that was mixed with joy and a bit of absurdness.</p><br/><p>It was the result of several things combining.</p><br/><p>The saga, Scathach\u2019s techniques, the sentence of the Milesians, and the Tower of Shadows.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is it a combination of Asgard and Erin?\u2019</p><br/><p>If even one of those things were lacking, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to produce the current result.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho slowly raised his head and looked at the front.</p><br/><p>[Synchro rate: 69%]</p><br/><p>10% had increased in an instant. The reason that the synchro rate, which had only increased 1% the past year and three months, had surged up explosively was simple.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho was now able to use the sword techniques of Kalsted.</p><br/><p>He had become that much closer to him.</p><br/><p>\u2018I feel like I can know.\u2019</p><br/><p>His thoughts about the synchro rate changed once again, and now, he felt like he realized it.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho had two theories about the synchro rate until now.</p><br/><p>The first one was established when he first entered Valhalla.</p><br/><p>1% of the synchro rate meant that Tae Ho was able to execute 1% of Kalsted\u2019s strength.</p><br/><p>It was the most intuitive theory, but he realized that that wasn\u2019t the case when he became an inferior-ranked warrior.</p><br/><p>Because if that was the case, then he would have to be ten times stronger when he reached 10% from when he was at 1%.</p><br/><p>But that wasn\u2019t the case. There were times that the increase in strength wasn\u2019t relative to the numbers.</p><br/><p>Because of that, Tae Ho came up with the second theory.</p><br/><p>Kalsted\u2019s strength was the result of his several skills, items, and Tae Ho\u2019s influence. Because of that, he wouldn\u2019t be able to recreate Kalsted\u2019s strength just with catching up in stats.</p><br/><p>He had thought that it was a quite convincing theory, but he realized that it wasn\u2019t the case now.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s much simpler.\u2019</p><br/><p>The more the synchro rate increased, the closer Tae Ho moved to becoming Kalsted.</p><br/><p>Precisely speaking, he grew closer to the \u2018strongest\u2019 image the Dragon Knight, Kalsted, had.</p><br/><p>The synchro rate was a kind of scale, and that scale wasn\u2019t clear mathematically.</p><br/><p>People normally felt a big difference between 19% and 20%. It was different depending with each person, but that difference was always bigger than that mathematic 1%.</p><br/><p>The synchro rate was closer to a psychological resemblance.</p><br/><p>Because of that, a big gap could obviously exist between 99% and 100%.</p><br/><p>However close 99% seemed to be at completion, in the end, the 100% was the real completion. There was a great psychological difference in that 1% one couldn\u2019t describe with words.</p><br/><p>It seemed like a messed up description, but it was somewhat convincing.</p><br/><p>Because the saga was something like that.</p><br/><p>It was the story of a hero that was transmitted from mouth to mouth and was shared by people.</p><br/><p>\u2018Whatever the case, what\u2019s certain is that I grow stronger the higher it gets.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho organized his thoughts simply and turned his head. Cuchulainn was smiling.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you finish with the appreciation?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomewhat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cArrogant bastard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn was still smiling and his expression was closer to a friendly one rather than a curse.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, Tae Ho also flashed a smile towards Cuchulainn. Cuchulainn looked at him for a moment and then looked at the huge spear.</p><br/><p>\u201cScathach\u2019s style techniques have been added onto your sloppy sword techniques. If we have to put a name, should it be \u2018Scathach\u2019s style, Tae Ho\u2019s law\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>The name was a bit weird but it wasn\u2019t bad. Tae Ho nodded suitably and asked another thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Cuchulainn, you knew that my swordsmanship was a sham?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I did. Ragnar should also know it.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was nothing to say about Cuchulainn, but Ragnar was also a master of the sword. They could realize that Tae Ho\u2019s swordsmanship was a sham just by seeing a bit of it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait. Then the two of you just left me be?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though they knew it was a mess?</p><br/><p>Tae Ho was absentminded for a moment, as Cuchulainn had spoken too obviously, and then threw a question. Tae Ho was feeling betrayed even if but a little.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn merely shook his head instead of apologizing and then said with a sigh,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was beyond our capabilities to intervene. You now have a lot of actual combat experience, but it wasn\u2019t the case before. If we intervened for nothing and you started to use a sloppy swordsmanship instead of the strength of your saga, there was a high probability for you to grow weakened. We were just waiting for the right time.\u201d</p><br/><p>In addition, saying that Tae Ho\u2019s swordsmanship was sloppy was only from the perspectives of the masters like Ragnar and Cuchulainn.</p><br/><p>Even though his swordsmanship was sloppy, it was still a strength that belonged to his saga. It was more than enough to reach the intermediate-ranked warrior.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I honestly got surprised. I was just planning on replacing your sword techniques with Scathach\u2019s style techniques, but the two became one. How marvelous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn finished speaking and then swung the spear he was holding. It was an attack that was executed so naturally that one could only perish by it even if they attentive.</p><br/><p>However, Tae Ho blocked Cuchulainn\u2019s attack. It was to the point that it was so natural it didn\u2019t give the feeling that they had exchanged blows.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn smiled. He then swung his spear a few more times and Tae Ho blocked it all very lightly.</p><br/><p>\u2018It feels like we are playing catch ball.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn stopped his attacks the moment Tae Ho thought that.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good. The completion rate is high. Scathach\u2019s style techniques indeed. Master is certainly amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI do agree, but is that the only thing you have to say?\u201d</p><br/><p>In the end, he was just praising Scathach. Shouldn\u2019t he praise Tae Ho- no, Kalsted\u2019s sword techniques in situations like this?</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn shook his head at Tae Ho\u2019s question as if it was nonsense.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is my philosophy that the strongest martial art doesn\u2019t exist. A warrior of the Temple I met in the Great War told me this, and I agreed to it completely.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn\u2019s answer was a bit off the mark, but Tae Ho asked as he was curious as to what he would say.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn smirked and answered,</p><br/><p>\u201cA strongest army doesn\u2019t exist, but a strongest person does. There\u2019s no need for me to interpret it further, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho nodded slowly. In the end, it was more important who the person was rather than the techniques they displayed.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, ranks also exist in martial arts. Because of that, someone that has the same skills can become strong or weak depending on what martial arts he\u2019s learned. But contrary to that, even though you do learn some martial arts, you will also grow weak or strong depending on who you are.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn saw Scathach\u2019s style techniques as training an ability of a person rather than a technique to handle weapons.</p><br/><p>As the essence of Scathach\u2019s techniques was one of gaining insight, it was a correct description if one interpreted it as such.</p><br/><p>\u2018In the end, he\u2019s saying that Scathach is the best.\u2019</p><br/><p>Because Scathach\u2019s techniques could train people, and the handling of weapons was also outstanding.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooking at it with that meaning, your newly made\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKalsted\u2019s techniques.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, you can say that it\u2019s a martial art that is closer to the concept of the strongest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn nodded as if he agreed to his own words and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhatever the case, the conclusion is that our master is great and so you are too, but you shouldn\u2019t get too conceited. You still haven\u2019t been able to reach the essence of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn finished speaking and then swung his spear once again. Tae Ho also blocked it reflexively this time, but it was different from before.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t able to see it properly. He could see the next move Cuchulainn had planned clearly, but now it was faint.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t see it well right? It\u2019s because there\u2019s a clear difference between you and me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The both of them had learned Scathach\u2019s style techniques, but the completion was different.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho\u2019s insight couldn\u2019t be compared to the strongest warrior of Erin, the Prince of Light, Cuchulainn.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut if you are able to reach the absolute peak and you get the transcendent eyes\u2026\u2026. You will be able to stand victorious no matter who your opponent is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Scathach\u2019s techniques had the peak as their objective.</p><br/><p>The eyes of a transcendent that saw through the essence of everything.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, this is merely a possibility, but I and master still haven\u2019t reached that ideal peak.\u201d</p><br/><p>But Cuchulainn still sent him a proud smile as if he was looking forward to it.</p><br/><p>Actually, he had been a bit surprised that Tae Ho was able to block his attack. He had swung his spear to hit him, but for him to block it\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is this Kalsted\u2019s style techniques?\u2019</p><br/><p>The strongest swordsman in the Dark Age whose image was added to Scathach\u2019s techniques.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn could feel his blood boil. He couldn\u2019t not look forward to it when he imagined how strong Tae Ho would eventually become.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho evaded Cuchulainn\u2019s burdensome but thankful eyes and changed the subject.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Cuchulainn, I have something I want to ask you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe place called the Temple\u2026.do the warriors there use cultivation techniques and have schools and sects?\u201d</p><br/><p>For there to not be a strongest army but a strongest warrior.</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t that a line that was used in novels.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn opened his eyes widely at Tae Ho\u2019s question and answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, yes. They did use a peculiar strength called energy. They also had a secret art to gain eternal life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn looked at a distant place as if he was remembering the past and continued speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen I fought in the Great War, there was someone called the Sword King of the Vast Sky that battled alongside me. The temple is a place that is closer to Asgard rather than Erin\u2026..a world where Gods and warriors exist, and he said that the warriors used energy and the Gods used supernatural arts. He also said that there was an organization comparable to our knights.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho felt like he was now completely certain of it. He then decided to put a wedge in it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying just in case, but isn\u2019t the strongest warrior a pegasus?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, how did you know? Did Ragnar tell you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>So the Temple was eastern mythology.</p><br/><p>Asgard was a myth of Scandinavia, Erin from Britain and Ireland, and Olympus from Greece and Rome. So it was kind of right.</p><br/><p>\u2018There should be many people with similar names to mine in the Temple.\u2019</p><br/><p>He felt like he could understand why Bjorn had talked about the Temple when Tae Ho had first entered Valhalla.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho cleared his curiousness to a certain extent and then sat on the ground. After some more time, he wanted to lie down, and Tae Ho didn\u2019t hold back the urge.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy, did you get exhausted?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn looked down on the lying Tae Ho and said.</p><br/><p>It was quite understandable for him to have grown exhausted, as the battle against Ferdia mac Daman had lasted for several hours this time.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho looked back at him as if there really was a need to ask and then placed his hand on his stomach.</p><br/><p>The Tower of Shadows was a mental place. As such, there was no need to eat, and one didn\u2019t get exhausted no matter how hard they exercised.</p><br/><p>Still, Tae Ho wanted to eat food. Precisely speaking, he wanted Heda\u2019s food.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to see Heda.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn smirked as Tae Ho mumbled unconsciously.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho had been climbing the tower for a year and three months already. Compared to Cuchulainn, who could go out of the tower to meet Scathach, Tae Ho could only remain in the tower. So the time he spent in the tower was the time he hadn\u2019t been able to see heda.</p><br/><p>\u201cShall we go out now?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Cuchulainn sat on the ground and asked, Tae Ho shook his head immediately.</p><br/><p>\u201cEy, we still have to go a bit more. We are merely at the eleventh floor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cVenomous bastard.\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, his tone was closer to a curse compared to before.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut it is really marvelous. It doesn\u2019t seem a lie that you want to meet Heda, so how are you able to endure this well? Normally, you go crazy because you want to go out. It was the same for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, compared to the others, Tae Ho had Cuchulainn to converse with.</p><br/><p>But even if that were the case, Tae Ho was enduring too well.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho had died more than a thousand times the past year and three months. It was easy to say, but he had died a thousand times. This meant that Tae Ho experienced death at least twice a day on average.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t easy to endure this even if one knew it wasn\u2019t real death. Tae Ho would have already gone crazy if he was a normal person as even the pain was real.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho scratched his chin as if Cuchulainn\u2019s question was hard to answer and then said,</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, what can I say\u2026..should I call it an instinct to conquer? Like I have to beat it? And even more when I\u2019m given floors like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Beat the first floor to go to the second. Beat the second and go to the third.</p><br/><p>A famous mountain climber had said this.</p><br/><p>That he climbed mountains because they were there.</p><br/><p>It was the same. He would climb the tower because it was there. He would conquer it as he had something to conquer.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho hadn\u2019t been the best professional gamer in the world for nothing.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn listened to Tae Ho\u2019s excuse and then shook his head as if it was hard to understand. He then spoke again.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways, for how long are you going to stay here? Are you saying that you will stay for a hundred, no, a thousand years more? I can\u2019t wait for you that long. Don\u2019t blame me if I go out first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEy, i\u2019m not planning on conquering it until the end, only.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m also not planning on staying too long either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because he really wanted to see Heda.</p><br/><p>Time was still flowing outside, albeit slower than in the Tower of Shadows.</p><br/><p>It took a year and three months to climb to the eleventh floor.</p><br/><p>And he wasn\u2019t planning on changing his conquering method now.</p><br/><p>He was planning on clearing it repeatedly.</p><br/><p>But wasn\u2019t planning on staying for too long either.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho rose up.</p><br/><p>He looked at the ceiling and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m planning on climbing it a bit faster from now on.\u201d</p><br/><p>A contradictory statement, but Tae Ho spoke like that.</p><br/><p>And that happened for real.</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>[Idun\u2019s Valkyrie]</p><br/><p>[Scathach]</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 32 \u2013 The land of darkness (6) &gt; End</p><br/><p>=====</p><header></header><div> Episode 32/Chapter 7: The land of darkness (7)<br/><p>TL: Tsubak</p><br/><p>ED: Julsmul</p><hr/><br/><p>The sun set and rose up again.</p><br/><p>They were still small and cute, but Rolo\u2019s offspring had started to look more like gryphons, Adenmaha, who was playing with them, raised their heads to check the location of the sun. It was now time to enter the cave of Scathach.</p><br/><p>It had already been a few months since she had started to learn the mystical powers of the Tuatha De Danann instead of Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha had become more knowledgeable in the several magics thanks to Scathach\u2019s classes, but her steps towards Scathach\u2019s cave were always heavy.</p><br/><p>But it was different now.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha hummed and left Rolo\u2019s nest, and Rolo\u2019s wives Ferrari and Benz looked at Rolo as if to inquire on what was happening.</p><br/><p>\u2018It seems like noonim has reached the boundary where she can enjoy things.\u2019</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t they say that if one couldn\u2019t dodge it, they should just enjoy it?</p><br/><p>Ferrari and Benz praised Rolo as being outstanding because of his guess, and the chirping chicks also chirped even harder.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hoho, this is the way you should be living.\u2019</p><br/><p>His master was training or something and wasn\u2019t even calling him.</p><br/><p>Rolo looked at his fox-like wives and his rabbit-like children and put on a proud face.</p><br/><p>But the happy times of Rolo were also coming to an end.</p><br/><p>In addition to that, his guess about Adenmaha was also wrong.</p><br/><p>The reason Adenmaha hummed and headed towards Scathach\u2019s cave wasn\u2019t because she had developed into a masochist as expected of a Valkyrie of Idun\u2019s legion(?) and started to enjoy her lessons.</p><br/><p>It was the twentieth day since Tae Ho entered the Tower of Shadows.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn had told her when he got out of tower for a moment.</p><br/><p>That Tae Ho would be getting out of the tower today.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehehe.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reason she was happy wasn\u2019t only because Tae Ho was going to get out.</p><br/><p>It was because Tae Ho had successfully cleared the assignment that evil witch Scathach had given him, and a really good thing happened.</p><br/><p>[Idun\u2019s Valkyrie]</p><br/><p>[Scathach]</p><br/><p>Of course, Adenmaha didn\u2019t have the \u2018Eyes of the Dragon\u2019 and she couldn\u2019t see the green words.</p><br/><p>But she felt like she could sense the letters above Scathach\u2019s head, who was sitting with a casual expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou came?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I did.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha raised her chin and answered briefly.</p><br/><p>Scathach, that was reading a book in her chair, opened her eyes sharply and Adenmaha gulped dry saliva.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s a battle of spirit! You can\u2019t lose!\u2019</p><br/><p>Adenmaha determined herself and maintained a calm expression while hiding that her heart beat had increased.</p><br/><p>Scathach smirked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour words have shortened once again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, that\u2019s because I\u2019m now your senio\u2026\u2026.Uak!\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha fell to the ground. She collapsed while not being able to finish her words and screamed and Scathach, who\u2019d pinned down Adenmaha in an instant, twisted her arm roughly and asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Valkyrie! Senior!\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha yelled hurriedly with a red face.</p><br/><p>Just like how the ocean had an upper and lower region, there were also seniors and juniors between Valkyries of a legion. Although you didn\u2019t have the right to order others just because you were seniors, juniors still had to respect them.</p><br/><p>However, Scathach pretended not to have heard Adenmaha\u2019s cry and tilted her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cSen\u2026..what?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a lie. There was no way she didn\u2019t hear that.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha tried to use a more effective attack instead of transforming recklessly like the last time.</p><br/><p>\u201cI- I will tell master!\u201d</p><br/><p>As Tae Ho was the commander of the legion, it could be said that he had a higher position than the Valkyries. However, Scathach didn\u2019t mind that.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still my disciple.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAkk!\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha let out a cry once again, but Scathach still didn\u2019t budge. She rather twisted Adenmaha\u2019s arm more harshly and said with a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce a master?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA- Always a master!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s enough if you know that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Scathach put down Adenmaha\u2019s wrist and then sat on the chair once again. She didn\u2019t shed even a drop of sweat even though she\u2019d moved so rashly.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Adenmaha had become a mess. She sobbed sorrowfully like a damsel in distress while being on the floor and mumbled in a low voice,</p><br/><p>\u201cSob sob, the legion is flowing backwards.\u201d</p><br/><p>Scathach turned to look at Adenmaha once again and she flinched. She had said it for her to hear it, but was it too loud? Did she have to say it a bit lower?</p><br/><p>Scathach looked at the flinching Adenmaha and then clicked her tongue and pointed the side next to hers with her chin.</p><br/><p>\u201cWipe off your tears and sit over here. It\u2019s almost time for him to wake up. You wouldn\u2019t want to face him while looking like that, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Today was a good day.</p><br/><p>One of the reasons for that had gone out the window, but there was still the other reason.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha determined herself and then wiped off her tears to sit next to Scathach. There was a big platform next to the two people where Tae Ho was lying.</p><br/><p>There was a time difference of thirty times between the world Tae Ho was at and the world Adenmaha was at. Because of that, not even Scathach could determine exactly when Tae Ho would wake up.</p><br/><p>Scathach started to read the book again and waited patiently, and Adenmaha rolled her feet while sitting down and waited for Tae Ho to wake up.</p><br/><p>And about ten minutes later-</p><br/><p>Tae Ho opened his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeda.\u201d</p><br/><p>The first thing he called out when he woke up was the name of Heda.</p><br/><p>Scathach smiled as if it was absurd and then said,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really have your priorities set straight.\u201d</p><br/><p>It really was the case. Adenmaha pouted her lips once and then stood up and approached Tae Ho. It was an elegant walking that wasn\u2019t in a rush.</p><br/><p>\u201cAdenmaha?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you return?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Adenmaha spoke with a well-mannered expression, Tae Ho rose his upper body and blinked. He then stood up and embraced Adenmaha.</p><br/><p>\u201cAdenmaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKyak?\u201d</p><br/><p>Whether the surprised Adenmaha screamed or not, Tae Ho still put more strength in his two arms.</p><br/><p>It had only been twenty two days in Adenmaha\u2019s point of view but it had been two years for Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>It would be a lie if he didn\u2019t want to see her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI- It\u2019s- hmph.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha mumbled from Tae Ho\u2019s embrace. Tae Ho laughed as if this kind of reaction was also good and then looked in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you back?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere was some progress indeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Scathach put on a satisfied face and looked at Tae Ho from head to toe. His looks hadn\u2019t changed, but Scathach could know.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho\u2019s spirit had also changed. The sentence of the Milesians was also emanating a strength so strong it couldn\u2019t even be compared to before.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you climbed up to the thirty seventh floor right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I learned all the basic techniques of Scathach\u2019s style.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seven months to reach the eleventh floor.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho had climbed up to the thirty seventh, and there were really few people that had climbed up to that floor in only two years.</p><br/><p>In addition, Tae Ho hadn\u2019t just ascended once. He had cleared the floors several times with the various types of weapons he possessed.</p><br/><p>\u2018He may have set up a new record if he had climbed normally.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn manifested next to Tae Ho and sent a message magic so only Scathach could hear it, and Scathach answered with a smile from her eyes.</p><br/><p>In the other hand, Tae Ho activated the \u2018Eyes of the Dragon\u2019 out of habit as he hadn\u2019t returned to reality for a long while.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, Scathach-nim?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. I became a Valkyrie of Idun\u2019s legion just like I promised.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho had successfully cleared the assignment Scathach had given him.</p><br/><p>Idun requested Scathach to train the warriors in her legion, and Scathach gladly agreed to it.</p><br/><p>Training talented warriors and turning them into heroes was one of her joys.</p><br/><p>Having entered Valhalla was already proving the greatness of a warrior, so for Scathach, it was like having entered a theme park with various kinds of rides.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my junior, my junior. I am the senior here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha whispered in a really low voice from Tae Ho\u2019s embrace. Tae Ho laughed like Bracky and then released Adenmaha.</p><br/><p>\u201cWarrior Tae Ho, it\u2019s a meeting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Scathach said suddenly.</p><br/><p>And then, that became a formality.</p><br/><p>Scathach approached Tae Ho and he lowered his posture like he did with Idun. Scathach\u2019s lips reached Tae Ho\u2019s forehead.</p><br/><p>\u201cMay Idun\u2019s blessing accompany you.\u201d</p><br/><p>A blessing from a Valkyrie.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho could sense a change in his saga.</p><br/><p>The name of a new Valkyrie was recorded in the \u2018Warrior that had a Valkyrie Meet Him\u2019.</p><br/><p>[Scathach]</p><br/><p>The Queen of the Land of Darkness. The teacher of the great heroes.</p><br/><p>\u2018I should organize it a bit\u2019</p><br/><p>Because he could only register up to nine names in the saga.</p><br/><p>If he didn\u2019t clear a spot, Scathach\u2019s name would disappear. Because of that, Tae Ho quickly reviewed the list of Valkyries.</p><br/><p>[Idun\u2018s Valkyrie] : [Heda] / [Adenmaha] / [Scathach]</p><br/><p>[Odin\u2018s Valkyrie] : [Rasgrid]</p><br/><p>[Tir\u2018s Valkyrie] : [Reginleif]</p><br/><p>[Tir\u2018s Valkyrie] : [Gandur]</p><br/><p>[Ullr\u2018s Valkyrie] : [Ingrid]</p><br/><p>[Njord\u2018s Valkyrie] : [Kaldea]</p><br/><p>[Valkyrie Lord] : [Freya]</p><br/><p>First, he erased the name of Hildegarde to make a spot for Scathach, as the completion rate was low and he thought he wouldn\u2019t see her much.</p><br/><p>\u2018Should it be better to swap Kaldea for Sigrun or Gudrun?\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho hadn\u2019t met them yet, but had heard their names and knew their existences through the things he had heard from Cuchulainn.</p><br/><p>Just looking at the performances of the Valkyries, he had to choose Kaldea without even thinking about it as it wasn\u2019t proper to compare a veteran Valkyrie to the two that had just become so.</p><br/><p>But the story changed if he took the completion rate into account.</p><br/><p>The number of blessings and the type of relationship influenced the completion rate, so it would be better to complete it with a Valkyrie that lived in the same residence as him instead of a Valkyrie of another legion he wouldn\u2019t be seeing much.</p><br/><p>\u2018Who should I take out?\u2019</p><br/><p>Even if he did take out Kaldea from the list, there was one spot lacking.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do I have to take out Rasgrid or Reginleif\u2026\u2026..\u2019</p><br/><p>The two of them were outstanding Valkyries, but their completion rate was lower than the other Valkyries and he even met her few times.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ingrid has a high completion rate, and I think that I will be seeing Gandur a lot because of Siri.\u2019</p><br/><p>Ingrid was the one that had the highest completion rate after to Heda because of the time they had been together in Midgard. It seemed like it would change soon as Adenmaha was increasing at a frightening pace, but even if that were the case, she had the third highest completion rate.</p><br/><p>\u2018Actually, just looking at the completion rates, I should take out Freya.\u2019</p><br/><p>Because he could meet the other Valkyries in the battlefield, but he almost certainly couldn\u2019t meet a Goddess.</p><br/><p>From a different perspective, he may be able to tell her to help him on strengthening his saga just like he did so for the other Valkyries, but he was talking to none other than Freya. It was doubtful whether she would agree to it or not and may even order him to remove her from the list as it was impertinent.</p><br/><p>\u2018But it\u2019s still regretful.\u2019</p><br/><p>The Goddess of Magic and Beauty and the second most beautiful- no, besides that, a strong Goddess that had light emanating from her.</p><br/><p>He may be seeing her more than he thought as he had become a commander now. If he accumulated the blessings slowly, she would surely become a reliable force.</p><br/><p>\u2018Good, let\u2019s think of the other things at a later time.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho finished reviewing the list in a short time and then looked downwards. Adenmaha was struggling on her toes to give him a blessing.</p><br/><p>\u201cMay Idun\u2019s blessing accompany you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMay Idun\u2019s blessing accompany you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha barely managed to bless him and then smiled brightly and said something. However Tae Ho turned his head reflexively. It was because a familiar sound of foot step was heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cPant, pa\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Her breath was rough maybe because she came running to this place. When Heda reached the residence of Scathach, she took a breath and collected herself with a bright smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello once aga\u2026\u2026Tae Ho?!\u201d</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t finish her words. It was because Tae Ho closed the distance in an instant and then grabbed her waist and kissed her.</p><br/><p>Heda tried to push Tae Ho because there were many eyes looking them, but he didn\u2019t even budge.</p><br/><p>It had only been twenty two days for Heda, but two long and gruelling years had gone by for Tae Ho. He couldn\u2019t let go of her.</p><br/><p>And in the end, Heda also received him. Adenmaha pouted, Cuchulainn sent a lukewarm gaze, and Scathach smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cMay Idun\u2019s blessing accompany you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMay Idun\u2019s blessing accompany you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The completion percentage of Heda\u2019s clone increased yet again.</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was a really busy day.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda said when she exited out of the cave.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho wasn\u2019t the only one to have returned. The lowest-ranked warriors of Idun\u2019s legion that had gone out on their first expedition with Sigrun were returning as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cFortunately, there don\u2019t seem to be any deaths.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey would have grown a bit more if they had accumulated runes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha and Scathach, that were following from behind, offered their respective opinions.</p><br/><p>Heda laughed and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was preparing food with Gudrun. We have to open a party that doesn\u2019t fall behind to the night banquet.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were now more than twenty people in Idun\u2019s residence. It wasn\u2019t an easy thing for two people to prepare all the food alone, but it seemed like Heda enjoyed even that.</p><br/><p>Because it had been a really long time since Idun\u2019s legion was this lively.</p><br/><p>\u201cA ship is coming.\u201d</p><br/><p>Scathach looked at a distant place as soon as they reached the dock and said. Adenmaha frowned as if she couldn\u2019t see well, but Tae Ho could see the green words that were approaching.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go greet Idun-nim after the party ends.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda said in a low voice while looking beyond the dock with a proud face. Tae Ho has been staying in the residence until now, but looking at it in another way, he had gone to a far away place and just returned. So receiving an audience with her was only proper.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho nodded immediately as he wanted to see Idun almost as much as Heda. He then looked at the green words approaching and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, Heda.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUm\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you go to meet them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Because the new warriors also belonged to Idun\u2019s legion.</p><br/><p>Heda opened her eyes widely at Tae Ho\u2019s question and then laughed merrily. She opened her eyes sharply and said playfully,</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder? What do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Tch tch, you have already lost since you asked.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn clicked his tongue as if Tae Ho still had a long way to go. Meanwhile, people approached Tae Ho. Their faces were a welcome sight.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy king.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt has been a while. You\u2019ve changed a lot in three weeks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMerlin. Master Ragnar. It\u2019s great to see both of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed like Merlin had gotten quite accustomed to the residence while Tae Ho wasn\u2019t around. He seemed as relaxed as a person in his hometown.</p><br/><p>\u201cSiri said that she would be coming later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha added. It really was a gathering of the family of Idun\u2019s legion. The first after a really long while.</p><br/><p>The big warship reached the dock. Rolo and his wives brought his babies, and McLaren also showed his face with a healthy visage.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Idun!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Idun!\u201d</p><br/><p>As the warriors that had remained in the residence yelled, the warriors that jumped down from the ship also yelled.</p><br/><p>\u201cValkyrie Sigrun greets the commander.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cValkyrie Gudrun greets the commander.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sigrun and Gudrun hit their chests twice and expressed etiquette towards Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho also expressed his manners and the banquet Heda had prepared started.</p><br/><p>An indeterminate amount of time soon passed.</p><br/><p>Not long after everyone got settled, Siri joined the banquet just like Adenmaha had said.</p><br/><p>There was then one more person that reached the dock of Idun\u2019s legion.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a wooden boat but a swan. As soon as she landed on the ground, the swan that had transformed into a black-haired Valkyrie passed the warriors confidently and stood in front of Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cHildegarde.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cValkyrie Hildegarde greets the commander of Idun.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hildegarde expressed etiquette and gave a blessing on Tae Ho\u2019s forehead. Heda looked at that and then frowned and asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cHildegarde, why have you come here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Because she hadn\u2019t heard that Hildegarde would be visiting. In addition, it was in the middle of the night.</p><br/><p>As Heda asked with a wary expression, Hildegarde looked at Tae Ho once again and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cFreya-nim is calling the commander of Idun.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Goddess of Magic and Beauty, Freya, who commands all the Valkyries in Valhalla.

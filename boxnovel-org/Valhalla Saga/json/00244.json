It got swept by black flames and it started to scatter. The rain of black flames pouring down from the sky was the end of the sun.</p><br/><p>Karna saw that. He staggered and then vomited blood.</p><br/><p>The world shook the moment the black sun got destroyed. It wasn\u2019t a comparative expression. It literally happened. The Sword of creation had that much power behind it.</p><br/><p>In addition, the black sun was a manifested representation of Karna\u2019s divinity. The destruction of the black sun meant the destruction of Karna\u2019s divinity.</p><br/><p>Karna felt severe pain in his chest and raised his head. The master of Erin that had split the black sun with the Sword of creation was looking down at him.</p><br/><p>Light emanated once again from his hands.</p><br/><p>The Sword of the round table appeared in Tae Ho\u2019s right hand and the Dragon sword Astelone in his left one.</p><br/><p>Karna sensed. The last attack had also exhausted the master of Asgard. That was an obvious thing. He had used a sword that split the world so he would have spent a considerable amount of strength.</p><br/><p>But Karna also understood that Tae Ho\u2019s breathing was recovering at a fast rate. It should be one of the two. That he had an incredible recovery rate or that his stamina was so vast you couldn\u2019t see the end of it.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t matter whatever it was. The important thing was the things that would happen after that.</p><br/><p>Karna raised the bow of Arjuna, Gandiva. The bow that originally belonged to the commander of the beings that wanted to destroy the world and the ancient God of Xindu, Shiva, passed the hands of Agni and then entered Arjuna\u2019s hands. And right at this moment, Karna was litting up the last flames from his hands.</p><br/><p>Karna knocked the bowstring and at that moment a peculiar sound of Gandiva rang.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho moved. He charged towards the flame arrow and swung the Sword of the round table and Astelone. He destroyed the flame arrow and advanced.</p><br/><p>Karna also saw that. He stood still in place and continued to fire arrows. Blood flowed from Karna\u2019s lips and flame arrows poured on Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>Each one of them was strong. But the power behind the Sword of the round table and Astelone could easily stop the flames of Agni. Tae Ho\u2019s didn\u2019t miss a single arrow.</p><br/><p>Only a few seconds.</p><br/><p>Or perhaps fewer than that.</p><br/><p>Dozens of arrows were fired and dozens of arrows got destroyed.</p><br/><p>Karna let go of Gandiva. He grabbed the air to face Tae Ho that would arrive in front of him in a few breaths.</p><br/><p>Vasavi Shakti.</p><br/><p>The spear of the God of Thunder Indra.</p><br/><p>It also was a weapon with a lot of history behind it. Long ago, when Karna was still active as a human hero.</p><br/><p>Indra tried to take the golden armor and earrings of the God of Sun Surya, that gave an immortal strength to Karna to help his son Arjuna.</p><br/><p>What the God of thunder Indra used was a pledge from Karna. He approached Karna as a Brahman and requested the golden armor and earrings from him as Karna had made a pledge to not reject a request from a Brahman that was at the top rank and when Karna got to hear of Indra\u2019s intentions from his father Surya he requested a weapon instead of his armor and earring.</p><br/><p>Due to this the king of Gods Indra received a blow but he ended up giving the great spear Vasavi Shakti that could even kill Gods to Karna.</p><br/><p>The memory passed his head like a flashback. Karna put a smile that you couldn\u2019t know the meaning of and glared in front of him. He contained all his strength in Vasavi Shakti and threw it towards Tae Ho that was destroying all the flame arrows and charging towards him.</p><br/><p>Indrastra.</p><br/><p>Ironically, that thing didn\u2019t shine in white. The flashing spear of the thunder God received the power of the black sun of Karna and harbored black darkness in it.</p><br/><p>A moment.</p><br/><p>The moment Tae Ho faced Vasavi Shakti he could feel the power that was held behind the black spear. That power didn\u2019t fall behind to the lightning of Zeus Astrape at all.</p><br/><p>Because of that Tae Ho dropped both of his weapons. The sentences of Erin and Asgard shone at the same time and the two swords clashed with Vasavi Shakti one step ahead. Light and darkness got entangled and exploded and at that moment Tae Ho gripped the air. He took out a spear of death that could face the great spear that could even kill Gods.</p><br/><p>They clashed.</p><br/><p>Death against death. Light against darkness. Tae Ho\u2019s and Karna\u2019s divinity.</p><br/><p>The world shook once again. The sky and the ground rang and finally the light destroyed the darkness. Vasavi Shakti lost its strength in front of Gae Bolg\u2019s thrust. It got destroyed just like the black sun and released darkness.</p><br/><p>Black flames surged up along an explosion. Karna looked at the swelling darkness. And then looked at Tae Ho rushing at him while spreading his two swords like wings, like a streak of light passing through the darkness.</p><br/><p>Karna didn\u2019t close his eyes and the spear of death pierced his chest.</p><br/><p>Karna looked at Tae Ho and Tae Ho looked him back.</p><br/><p>Karna opened his lips dyed with blood. He now contained the last of his divinity in his lips.</p><br/><p>It was to inflict him the last curse. No, actually it wasn\u2019t that. Tae Ho could know that and because of that he didn\u2019t stop Karna from speaking.</p><br/><p>Karna smiled. The unlucky hero that loved the world but was born as a being that wanted to destroy the world blessed the protector of Asgard.</p><br/><p>\u201cMay you be able to protect your own world.\u201d</p><br/><p>To not face the same end like Xindu.</p><br/><p>To not submit in the end.</p><br/><p>Karna\u2019s blessing got transmitted to Tae Ho. Tae Ho received Karna\u2019s power and Karna whispered a few more words to Tae Ho. It was his last request.</p><br/><p>Karna couldn\u2019t hear Tae Ho\u2019s answer. It was because death came to find him as soon as he finished speaking his last words.</p><br/><p>The God of the black sun became darkness but didn\u2019t scatter. It became a bright light and extinguished.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho put back Gae Bolg. The Sword of the round table and Astelone flew by their own and stopped Gilgamesh\u2019 sword rushing at Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>Kwagang!</p><br/><p>The huge sound proved how great the power behind Gilgamesh\u2019 sword was. What Gilgamesh was holding was the Sword of Uruk. It didn\u2019t have his divinity in it like the Sword of Ishtar but it was the Sword of his country- his world that he wanted to protect until the end but he couldn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>Gilgamesh was a king. He had lost his country, citizens and everything he had to protect but regardless of that he was still a king.</p><br/><p>And Tae Ho knew.</p><br/><p>What he was obsessed at. Why Karna made that request at the end. Why was he facing him so desperately.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t only because he had turned into a being that wanted to destroy the world from someone that wanted to maintain it. He still had something left to protect.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho couldn\u2019t know what that was. Whether it was his lover, his kid, or someone else. Perhaps it may not be a person.</p><br/><p>He was now a being that wanted to destroy the world. He belonged to the Kingdom of fire as a being that wanted to destroy the world and he also knew well that the final objective of the Kingdom of fire was the destruction of the worlds.</p><br/><p>But regardless of that he was participating in the battle that would lead to destruction to try to protect the last thing at least for one more second. Although he understood that destruction would come faster the more he participated in it.</p><br/><p>It was a terrible contradiction. The reason he was filled with anguish when he had turned into a being that wanted to destroy the world would be right because of that contradiction.</p><br/><p>Just how did this happen? It may be because the one that had turned him lacked comparing to Nyx. It could also be simply because Gilgamesh\u2019 will was strong. There were several possible cases.</p><br/><p>But that wasn\u2019t the important thing right now. Tae Ho remembered Karna\u2019s last request. He clashed against Gilgamesh once again.</p><br/><p>[Myth ranked saga]</p><br/><p>[He doesn\u2019t get tired even after fighting for a hundred days and nights]</p><br/><p>He had already spent a lot of strength but he didn\u2019t get exhausted. he was able to move like usual while he was breathing even if spent all his health, stamina, magic power and divinity.</p><br/><p>Because of that Gilgamesh couldn\u2019t win. He was too exhausted already. He hadn\u2019t been able to recover at all from the attack inflicted by Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>The two swords and spear danced. Uruk\u2019s swords didn\u2019t break but it ended up leaving the hands of Gilgamesh.</p><br/><p>Uruk\u2019s sword rolled the ground and Gae Bolg pierced Gilgamesh\u2019 shoulder. The Sword of the round table and Astelone pierced Gilgamesh\u2019 thigh and slashed his back.</p><br/><p>Gilgamesh couldn\u2019t endure it anymore.</p><br/><p>But he didn\u2019t collapse either. He hung in with his two legs and glared at Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho dropped Gae Bolg. He placed his hand on the chest of Gilgamesh that had no strength to lift a finger.</p><br/><p>A strong rune magic got executed from Tae Ho\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>Fall asleep.</p><br/><p>Until everything ends.</p><br/><p>This was Karna\u2019s last request. This was the last thing Karna could do for Gilgamesh as he had stood on the front lines of Xindu and destroyed Dilmun.</p><br/><p>Gilgamesh tried to resist at first but then he noticed the power of Karna contained in Tae Ho\u2019s rune magic. He opened his eyes widely and then gritted his teeth. He mumbled something towards Karna that had already become light and disappeared and then took in Tae Ho\u2019s\u2019 rune magic.</p><br/><p>Gilgamesh\u2019 body froze. The Great hero of Dilmun turned into a rock. The pillars that surged up from the ground became one with that Gilgamesh and formed a big rock.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho put his hand away. He had used a lot of strength so he took out a golden apple from the air and took a biet.</p><br/><p>War cries were ringing on the entire battlefield. They were being yelled by the warriors of the Golden palace and the martial artists that had witnessed the defeat of Karna and Gilgamesh.</p><br/><p>The 11 beasts, that were like clones for Tiamat, got captured by the Shinsoos of the Temple and couldn\u2019t move freely. The battle in the Golden palace was flowing favorably for the Temple.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho bit the golden apple once again and then noticed a pair of eyes looking at him.</p><br/><p>For Asgard and the nine realms.</p><br/><p>Kaldea hit her chest from far away and said.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho also hit his chest for her, that was smiling brightly even though she had been covered in blood. They spoke out loud although they were far with each other and they weren\u2019t able to hear them. It wasn\u2019t heard for the other but they contained words that would certainly be transmitted.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Asgard and the nine realms.\u201d</p><br/><p>War cries bursted out once again. The warriors of Valhalla roared and pushed back the Kingdom of fire.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho looked at a distant place. He looked at the remaining 11 beasts and saw Sigurd fighting against Jormungand far away. He saw the back of Nidhogg pressing down Tiamat and thought.</p><br/><p>Everything had an order.</p><br/><p>He had defeated Karna and Gilgamesh so now came the 11 beasts. After that was Jormungand and the last one was Tiamat.</p><br/><p>While the anvil was enduring, he would swing the hammer to crush the head of the enemies.</p><br/><p>It was similar to the basic strategy Odin had set up to face the Kingdom of fire. Tae Ho\u2019s role was to defeat the remaining enemies and change the flow of the battle while Sigurd and Nidhogg were holding down Jormungand and Tiamat.</p><br/><p>The finished eating the golden apple. He mumbled the name of Idun and Heda and then retrieved Gae Bolg and clenched the Sword of the round table and Astelone.</p><br/><p>Most of the 11 beasts, the clones of Tiamat, were of a dragon race.</p><br/><p>There was nothing to speak about Jormungand and Tiamat being dragons themselves.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho kicked the ground and surged up. He looked back at the achievements Kalsted had raised as someone that could execute the power of the World dragon Yggdrasil. He activated another saga as the dragon knight that had defeated countless evil dragons.</p><br/><p>[Myth ranked saga]</p><br/><p>[The end of dragons]</p><br/><p>A natural enemy of dragons that surpassed Sigurd.</p><br/><p>A dragon exterminating another dragon.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha and Echidna flinched at the dragon killing aura that surged up with the intent to cover the entire battlefield. Rolo and Drakon Ismenios got surprised and turned to look at Tae Ho and Nidhogg let out a low scream from far away.</p><br/><p>Even his allies were like this.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho\u2019s enemies, the 11 beasts, trembled in fear. Jormungand and Tiamat froze, although for a moment, and let out a groan.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s go in a cool way.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn said and Tae Ho smiled. The charged towards the 11 beasts.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 69 \u2013 Absolutely Invincible (4) &gt; End</p><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/>\n</div>"}

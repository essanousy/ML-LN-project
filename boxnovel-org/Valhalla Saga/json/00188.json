But the time she could see was really short. The transmission ended even before she could grasp the situation.</p><br/><p>Odin frowned slightly at Freya\u2019s anxious voice and then answered with a laid back voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cProbably. I wouldn\u2019t know if Ares was the antipode in the fate of Idun\u2019s warrior but he\u2019s the master of Asgard now.\u201d</p><br/><p>His claim was rather irresponsible but actually Odin had proof. He could see what was happening in Olympus a while longer than Freya and thanks to that he could also understand what kind of effect the \u2018Hall of Valhalla\u2019 Tae Ho spread with his divinity region had.</p><br/><p>Odin was the God of War. He had investigated about the Gods of Olympus long ago for the worst case situation and was confident to say that he knew them quite well.</p><br/><p>The opponent was the God of war Ares.</p><br/><p>If they had clashed head on then Idun\u2019s warrior wouldn\u2019t have any chances at victory. But that was only when he hadn\u2019t ranked up as a to ranked warrior and was still Idun\u2019s warrior.</p><br/><p>Looking that the seat of the master had been over it meant that Idun\u2019s warrior had awakened his deity.</p><br/><p>The God of battle.</p><br/><p>And at the same time the God of conquer.</p><br/><p>The deity showed a characteristic of a God clearly.</p><br/><p>Odin didn\u2019t even think that Idun\u2019s warrior would lose after he awakened as a God of battle and even halved Ares\u2019 divinity with his \u2018Hall of Valhalla\u2019.</p><br/><p>Odin checked the progress of the battle once again and nodded slowly. And in the first place, if Idun\u2019s warrior had been defeated the seat of the master of Asgard would have returned to him. But that wasn\u2019t happening so he was sure that Idun\u2019s warrior had won.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Odin, that was deep in his thoughts, tilted his head and asked.</p><br/><p>Freya let out a long sigh at his face that really didn\u2019t know what was wrong.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa\u2026.it really got handed over.\u201d</p><br/><p>The seat of the master of Asgard.</p><br/><p>Odin was the same as always but Freya could feel the difference. She couldn\u2019t sense the strength of the master from Odin anymore.</p><br/><p>Odin laughed refreshingly at Freya\u2019s words and then held her waist and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you are saying it got handed in a fake way?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh, you know that I really want to hit you right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you are going to hit me anyways please hit me gently.\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya closed her eyes as Odin spoke casually and then hit her chest a few times.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are really a snaky person.\u201d</p><br/><p>Odin\u2019s actions had become lighter after they defeated the World Wolf as if a tooth that bothered him had been plucked out.</p><br/><p>Freya regretted that Odin became darker after the Great War so she welcomed this change but she still missed Odin that had some weight in him.</p><br/><p>But regardless of Odin knowing how she felt, he laughed once again and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you that angry?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think I won\u2019t get angry? How can you not tell me? It was the same last time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because he didn\u2019t say a thing about Loki. He made her resent the hero that had sacrificed himself for Asgard for a hundred years.</p><br/><p>The eyes of Freya that were looking up at Odin became slightly red. It was because the frustration of Odin being secretive and the regret towards Loki had surged up.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. When I was in the roots I was in a situation that I had to imagine the worst\u2026.And after that, I could have never imagined this would happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you putting up that as an excuse? You had plenty of opportunities to tell me in the middle.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that you say it you are right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya dropped her shoulders as Odin agreed honestly. She felt like she was the only one becoming a fool the more they spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave it. Only my mouth hurts when we speak. In the end you are saying that you don\u2019t trust me. You just treat me as as someone you can hand over the trivial duties.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can that be? You are the only kid I can leave Valhalla to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are always like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya mumbled in a low voice and pouted and then Odin embraced her from her waist like he couldn\u2019t endure it anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis pouting side of you is also cute.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave it. I should really hit you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya really hit Odin\u2019s shin as soon as she finished speaking. But of course, it was really slightly and then checked if he was okay.</p><br/><p>Odin laughed once again at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you aware of me after hitting me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because i\u2019m too gentle, worrying about the leg of an old man.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, old man.\u201d</p><br/><p>Odin put more strength in the arm he was grabbing Freya. She snorted and then slapped Odin\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh, such a snaky person. Anyways, you know that this is not the time to be playing like this right? This means that Zeus and Ares have completely turned as enemies.\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya\u2019s voice became serious once again and Odin\u2019s eyes became sharp.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be the case for all of the 12 Olympians. Athena was next to Idun\u2019s warrior.\u201d</p><br/><p>The relationship between Ares and Athena was bad but it wasn\u2019t to the point they wanted to kill each other. But regardless of that, they were still facing each other so it was clear the sides had been split.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid an internal conflict arise?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder\u2026..it would be good if it were that simple\u2026.but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case. Didn\u2019t you also feel it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The ones wanting to destroy the world.</p><br/><p>Ares wasn\u2019t the God of war Odin and Freya knew anymore. He ended up switching sides completely.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have to open the connecting path the fastest possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t know how many of the 12 Olympians had changed sides. Perhaps, everyone except for Athena may be enemies of Idun\u2019s warrior. They had to dispatch reinforcements the fastest they could.</p><br/><p>But Odin spoke in a low voice instead of raising his voice like Freya.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be easy even if the two of us join hands as you can see that they sealed it with all their determination. Most of all\u2026i\u2019m not the master anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Odin had just returned from the northern region to Valhalla.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why he still hasn\u2019t met the seal in the connecting path.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t easy for someone that wasn\u2019t a master to dispel the seal spread by a master. In addition, the other side has just destroyed everything and then sealed it up. They had to reconstruct everything one by one and rebuild the connecting path again. So naturally, the former was much more difficult.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you are still the God of magic. You can do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya clenched her fists and said. Odin nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, I have to try however I can if it\u2019s to rescue Idun\u2019s warrior.\u201d</p><br/><p>Odin was planning to go to war with Olympus if it was to save Tae Ho even when he was still a top ranked warrior. But now that he had become the master of Asgard he would have to pour all of the forces of Asgard and save him.</p><br/><p>But it was then. Freya frowned as if something was wrong and then asked in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cOdin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat should I say. It was clearly an emergency situation but I feel somewhat relieved.\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya\u2019s face was close and she was the God that maintained the closest relationship with Odin since the Great War.</p><br/><p>Odin got bewildered at Freya\u2019s words but then understood her feelings. She nodded and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt must be because of your trust in him. That if it\u2019s Idun\u2019s warrior, he will be able to use the authority he just obtained in an effective way\u2026.Didn\u2019t he actually shave away Ares\u2019 divinity by spreading his own region of divinity?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat else can he do with the authority of the master?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA lot of things.\u201d</p><br/><p>Freya put on a dissatisfactory face at the vague answer but Odin still spoke of something else instead of explaining.</p><br/><p>\u201cFreya, the prettiest kid of Asgard. The war has just ended but we have to prepare for a new war.\u201d</p><br/><p>The war between Asgard and Olympus.</p><br/><p>Odin wasn\u2019t planning to have Asgard as the battlefield at all. If war erupted once again, they would be at the offensive instead of the defensive in that war.</p><br/><p>And what they needed for that.</p><br/><p>Odin sent flying the herd of crows that were sitting in the window with a gesture of his hand. He ordered Hugin that flew the highest.</p><br/><p>\u201cCall Thor.\u201d</p><br/><p>The God of Thunder that would stand at the vanguard of Asgard.</p><br/><p>While Hugin rushed off to somewhere Odin and Freya got out of Valhalla. They prepared a cat carriage that would head to the connecting path of Olympus.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>\u201cAdenmaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha smiled like a fool at Tae Ho\u2019s call and moved her fingers sluggishly. Looking at her rubbing her shoulders was really lovely.</p><br/><p>\u201cAdenmaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>He called her again but the reaction was vague again. It seemed like she was in her own world.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tch tch tch, poor thing. How did you treat her usually that she likes it that much with just having called her name? Look at the wall and reflect on your actions.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho also felt a little bit of guilt. Adenmaha was always at his side. He really felt like he had treated her too unkindly like Cuchulainn said.</p><br/><p>\u2018At least stroke her head. Or embrace her. Settling the battlefield comes after that.\u2019</p><br/><p>While Cuchulainn was coaching him, Tae Ho turned his body to the left reflexively. It was because there was someone running towards him.</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho master!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg embraced Tae Ho\u2019s neck. She raised her voice with a really excited voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe won! We defeated the bad guys! I defeated them with my roll!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, it\u2019s all because of Nidhogg.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg\u2019s eyes started to shine as Tae Ho complimented her. She smiled simply like Adenmaha and then twisted her body and said with a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cCompliment me a bit more. Stroke my head.\u201d</p><br/><p>She was quite honest in many meanings.</p><br/><p>As Tae Ho stroked her head while enduring the laughter, a new voice was heard behind him.</p><br/><p>\u201cOhh\u2026.lord. You have obtained a deity. Congratulations. I got sincerely impressed at your prowess of having defeated the God of war Ares.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you Ismenios. You have been of big help.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Tae Ho answered while creating some distance, Ismenios clenched his chest with an enchanted expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk, this\u2026.I believe that Drakon Ismenios will get drunk on happiness and lose consciousness.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018I really do think he\u2019s dangerous.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn spoke with disgust.</p><br/><p>No matter the case Ares was the blood brother of Drakon Ismenios. But of course, for Ismenios he was a villain that had kidnapped and detained his mother so he couldn\u2019t help but feel a bit of rejection.</p><br/><p>\u2018You can obtain peace when you look at Rolo.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho took one more step back while still holding Nidhogg and then looked at Rolo. He was putting on an uninterested face as expected.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut lord, what are you going to do with the children of Ares? There\u2019s a probability they will bother us so how about killing them all?\u201d</p><br/><p>Peace lasted only for a moment, Drakon Ismenios came up with an extreme opinion.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho got surprised and then activated the \u2018eyes of the dragon\u2019 and looked at the children of Ares. Excluding the ones that had died while Ares took away their divinity and the ones that lost their lives with the Valkyries, there were about twenty people that were half dead.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho said to Drakon Ismenios.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there really a need to do that? Ares died so they also got freed from his restraint.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut there may still be some that have loyalty towards him&gt;\u201d</p><br/><p>The expression of Drakon Ismenios was really serious. There were some like Hippolyte that had offered up their divinities themselves so there was no guarantee that they would simply side with them even if their restraint was freed up.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just imprison them for now. There may be some that convert like you, Ismenios.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even no one came up, he opposed to killing them all. Tae Ho was a God of battle, not a God of massacre.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026.I have been greatly impressed once again at your generosity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho interrupted his words, that were getting long, and then looked at Adenmaha and Nidhogg.</p><br/><p>\u2018Oh, it changed.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018WHat did?\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho transmitted Cuchulainn what he saw.</p><br/><p>[Tae Ho\u2019s Valkyrie]</p><br/><p>[Adenmaha]</p><br/><p>[Tae Ho\u2019s Valkyrie]</p><br/><p>[Nidhogg]</p><br/><p>The title \u2018Tae Ho\u2019s Valkyrie\u2019 appeared temporarily when he used his saga on Rolo but this was different.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha and Nidhogg weren\u2019t Idun\u2019s Valkyries anymore. They were Tae Ho\u2019s Valkyries.</p><br/><p>\u2018Did they move legions as you became the master?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes, i\u2019m sorry for Idun-nim but\u2026..this would be better just looking at the immediate efficiency. I can also lend them my strength. So\u2026\u2026.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018So?\u2019</p><br/><p>I\u2019m planning to gather the remaining power in Olympus into one.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, you shou\u2026.wait. This bastard, you are finally revealing your black side.\u2019</p><br/><p>The Valkyries of the other legions.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho was planning to move all of them to his legion. He had an excellent justification that he could increase the strength of the Valkyries a bit more in an isolated situation and he also had a way to execute the authority of the master.</p><br/><p>But of course, that wasn\u2019t because of a simple collecting greed. Just like Nidhogg\u2019s and Adenmaha\u2019s prayers were of help in the battle against Ares, Tae Ho would get strengthened just by increasing the number of members in his legion.</p><br/><p>\u2018Are you also going to make Siri and Bracky move?\u2019</p><br/><p>The two of them had a strong sense of belonging of their legion and in addition they received good will from the God they served.</p><br/><p>But thinking of the current situation, the correct answer was to move them to Tae Ho\u2019s legion.</p><br/><p>\u2018A legion of the main God will be made.\u2019</p><br/><p>A legion that was few in numbers but was comparatively strong.</p><br/><p>But contrary to Cuchulainn\u2019s expectation, Tae Ho shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u2018I have other plans for captain Siri and Bracky. Although I will have to see if that\u2019s possible.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Other plans?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Other plans.\u2019</p><br/><p>What he became able to do as he became the master.</p><br/><p>A new plan appeared in Tae Ho\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 55 \u2013 The legion of the main God (1) &gt; End</p><hr/><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/><p>Episode 55/Chapter 2: The legion of the main God (2)</p><br/><p>TL: Tsubak</p><br/><p>ED:</p><hr/><br/><p>\u201cSo master, what are you going to do in the end?\u201d</p><br/><p>At the entrance of the underworld after the \u2018Hall of Valhalla\u2019 has been retrieved.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho leaned up on Rolo that was lying down on his stomach and Adenmaha was leaning on his shoulder and arm.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho looked at Adenmaha\u2019s face that still had stains of her tears and then answered while looking forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cHermes will come soon. Athena-nim should have noticed the situation over here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho could feel the ones that were connected to him when he awakened as the master. Even though Athena was a God of Olympus, she was connected with Tae Ho through his saga so she must have also noticed the changes.</p><br/><p>But of course, he wasn\u2019t sure of it. Even if Athena realized that Tae Ho had awakened as the master she wouldn\u2019t know what happened after that.</p><br/><p>But she was a really wise person. In addition, Tae Ho was like the last thread of hope for her so she would try to check what happened however she could.</p><br/><p>\u2018SO anyways, you are saying that Hermes is going to come.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn organized the situation with a casual voice. It seemed like he was a bit absent minded and Tae Ho knew the reason for that. It was because he was checking on Nidhogg that was apprehending the children of Ares along with Drakon Ismenios.</p><br/><p>She had just learned how to make a knot so the speed she was doing it was really slow in addition that it was a mess but she was still trying her best. You could only smile warmly at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, so you are saying that meeting with Hestia-nim is the best for now right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe should be the one that is the finest among the forces of Olympus we can approach. And now that I see, did you meet Hestia-nim before?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u2026I think I saw her\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha paused and evaded Tae Ho\u2019s eyes. Tae Ho approached his face closer to her as she seemed really suspicious.</p><br/><p>\u201cSaw her\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha turned her head completely but it was meaningless as she was stuck next to Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha groaned for a while and then made an excuse.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, I was arguing that I had to go and rescue master\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cArgue?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd grabbed his throat\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha flushed.</p><br/><p>Summing up, she did meet Hestia but she was grabbing on Hermes\u2019 throat so she hadn\u2019t been able to greet her.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, the first impression wasn\u2019t good then.\u201d</p><br/><p>No, it was the worst.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho naturally thought of Adenmaha growling at Hermes while grabbing his throat and the Goddess that didn\u2019t know what to do and was putting a troubled expression.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha seemed to have read Tae Ho\u2019s mind that she spoke sharply.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know that this is all because of you right? I should lecture you first\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She stopped talking there. Adenmaha ended up pausing her words unconsciously when she was about to lecture him.</p><br/><p>The reason was obviously Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cAdenmaha, i\u2019m always grateful. You have always been with me since we met right? And you also gave me strength this time. If you hadn\u2019t been here I wouldn\u2019t have been able to defeat Ares. It\u2019s all thanks to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho looked at Adenmaha\u2019s eyes fixedly and spoke quickly and the effects were amazing. Adenmaha\u2019s face became red in different meaning to before and barely snorted after some time.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, hmph. You always try to pass away things\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m still really grateful at you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho spoke once again. This time, Bragi\u2019s rune worked hard and Adenmaha\u2019s face became even redder. She couldn\u2019t get angry at him anymore.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha ended up getting angry in the end and spoke with a dim face.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, don\u2019t do that anymore. Okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, I can\u2019t make that promise. I can\u2019t let you be in danger.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho grabbed her hand tightly and said. He felt like he could hear Cuchulainn struggling while criticizing him saying that it was too cheesy but Tae Ho cleanly ignored him.</p><br/><p>\u201cUhh\u2026I have to get angry at you but I can\u2019t\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha mumbled in a really low voice. She seemed like she was forcing it back but the corner of her lips was trying to curl up.</p><br/><p>\u2018Evil bastard. At least, don\u2019t use Bragi\u2019s rune. Huh?\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn clicked his tongue and said. Tae Ho answered in a low voice at his criticizing voice.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s embarrassing if I do that and it doesn\u2019t work.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018You are aware that it is embarrassing. And the results would probably remain the same even if you don\u2019t use the rune.\u2019</p><br/><p>He could know when he looked at her. I wouldn\u2019t be weird if Adenmaha\u2019s eyes changed into the shape of a heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cA, anyways! She was a beautiful God. She was really calm. I felt like she gave me the same feeling from when I first saw Idun-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha spoke pawing in the air as if trying to shake away her embarrassment. But the reaction of Tae Ho was a bit weird.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Was there something wrong in my explanation?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, um. The first impression is like that. Right. So anyways, she\u2019s a calm person.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho thought of the several sides Idun had and answered. It was because he also had the same impression as her when he first met Idun.</p><br/><p>A beautiful, noble, really calm and gentle Goddess.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s different now?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Of course.\u2019</p><br/><p>Just like when she stood up to Odin and Freya telling them not to try to scam him and give him a proper reward, or when she imitated Heda and teased him.</p><br/><p>But of course, it didn\u2019t mean that he was disappointed at here. He rather liked her more like this than when he first met her.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha tilted her head like she didn\u2019t know what Tae Ho\u2019s answer meant but then returned to speak about Hestia.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways, she has a really gentle atmosphere around her. And\u2026.uh\u2026.I thought about it again but I can only think her troubled face when I was grabbing Hermes by his throat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha grabbed her head and suffered. It was because she was really embarrassed to show such a side to her when she was trying to act like a \u2018Goddess like Goddess\u2019 usually.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go apologize together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho grabbed her hands again and said. Adenmaha then nodded with a depressed face.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hey, doesn\u2019t she have to apologize to Hermes instead of Hestia?\u2019</p><br/><p>Because Hermes was the one that got caught by his throat.</p><br/><p>But his voice wasn\u2019t heard to Adenmaha.</p><br/><p>And after a while, Adenmaha barely regained composure and changed the subject that had gone really astray to the beginning.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what after we meet Hestia-nim?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe should listen to what she says but we obtained several choices thanks to having defeated Ares.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUm\u2026.certainly. I can already think of three things.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd what are theym?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Tae Ho asked with curious eyes, Adenmaha hesitated for a moment but then spread three fingers and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, rescuing Demeter-nim? Athena-nim also said that she thinks Hephaestus-nim was also caught by Ares.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNext?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDestroying the barrier of Zeus guarding the connecting path? We don\u2019t know how big is the force stationed over there but you said you defeated Achilles, that is like their leader. Even if conquering them is difficult because we don\u2019t have that many forces we will still be able to attack. And I think that this is rather an opportunity.\u201d</p><br/><p>Olympus still didn\u2019t know about the death of Achilles, the defeat of Ares or the awakening of Tae Ho as the master.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t know the amount of forces the opponent would have but still, the group could ignore a certain force. If you took that into account, this was the best opportunity to ambush them now that their strongest countermeasure to them had been defeated.</p><br/><p>But Adenmaha, that said that, and Tae Ho that listened to her knew that this option wasn\u2019t likely to be choosed.</p><br/><p>The force of Zeus guarding the connecting path was still unknown. In addition, the group had spent a considerable amount of strength in the battle against Ares. They needed time to recover.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd the last?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFighting against Artemis.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha answered concisely. She was the closest and compared to Poseidon and Ares she was the most easy to deal with.</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed, all of them are likely.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, it isn\u2019t one of these?\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha asked while tilting her head as she had folded all three of her fingers. No matter how much she thought she couldn\u2019t think of another option.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho fixed Adenmaha\u2019s fingers and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust like I said before, we have to meet Hestia-nim and debate with Athena-nim and Apollo-nim a bit more. And the result for that can be one of the options you said.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel like there are other options.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, about two more.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha opened her eyes widely at Tae Ho\u2019s answer. For there to be two options instead of one.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, it isn\u2019t something reckless like \u2018now that it turned out like this we are going to invade mount Olympus!\u2019 right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can that be? There are two probable options.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are they? Tell me quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha grabbed Tae Ho\u2019s arm and urged an answer but Tae Ho spoke with a casual face.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou look cuter than usual because you are acting affectionately.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe\u2026.not!\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha was about to like it reflexively but then got a hold of herself and yelled.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho looked at her and smiled and Adenmaha pinched his arm but it was useless. Tae Ho obtained a body like steel after bathing in the river Styx like Achilles.</p><br/><p>He stroke the head of Adenmaha that didn\u2019t give up and was still pinching Tae Ho\u2019s arm and spoke with a playful voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will tell you when we meet Hestia-nim. We have to think what is more efficient between the two. Or we can also go with one of the options you mentioned first.\u201d</p><br/><p>The group didn\u2019t have much they could do before they moved to meet Hades but the situation had changed.</p><br/><p>They could also go on the offensive. The real counter attack started now.</p><br/><p>\u201cI tied up everything!\u201d</p><br/><p>A loud voice was heard then. When he turned his head with Adenmaha they saw Nidhogg smiling brightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho master! I tied it all!\u201d</p><br/><p>The number of survivors among the children of Ares was 19. Five of them were apprehended by Nidhogg and the remaining ones were tied down by Ismenios.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou did well! Nidhogg is great!\u201d</p><br/><p>As Adenmaha answered in a loud voice and waved her hand Nidhogg also waved back to her. If you saw them from a side they looked like a mother and a daughter that were out on a picnic.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe finally arrived.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho spoke in a low voice and stood up. Adenmaha stood up with him and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHermes-nim?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, it seems like I really did become a God.\u201d</p><br/><p>He could feel things he couldn\u2019t before he obtained a deity.</p><br/><p>He could clearly know that Hermes was approaching and what route he was taking even without needing to use the \u2018eyes of the dragon\u2019.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho looked at the place the magic circle was at. And a few seconds later, the messenger God that was wearing shoes with big wings in it appeared with the wind.</p><br/><p>He looked at his surroundings hurriedly with a nervous expression and then met eyes with Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis crazy. It was true!\u201d</p><br/><p>The master of Asgard.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho looked at that Hermes and he, that was hesitating for a moment, fixed his posture. He expressed etiquette politely to the master of Asgard as the messenger God of Olympus.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Goddess of Hearth Hestia greets the master of Asgard.\u201d</p><br/><p>The place they had moved through the magic circle of Hermes was the inside of a big shrine.</p><br/><p>The Goddess that was standing next to a hearth releasing light and fire expressed etiquette with a gentle smile.</p><br/><p>The Goddess of Hearth Hestia.</p><br/><p>She, that was the eldest yet the youngest daughter of Chronos was the sister of Zeus, Poseidon and Hades and at the same time with Hera and Demeter.</p><br/><p>So naturally, her divinity was really high and it was enough to get inside the 12 Olympians</p><br/><p>But as she didn\u2019t like arguing and fuss by nature, conceded her seat to the son of Zeus Dionysius herself and chose to retire.</p><br/><p>The woman that was covering herself with a red cloth was just like Adenmaha had explained.</p><br/><p>Brown words that gave you a warm feeling and scarlet eyes that were filled with gentleness. A white and pure face.</p><br/><p>No matter how ferocious someone was, it seemed like they would turn into simple sheeps in front of them.</p><br/><p>Even Cuchulainn, that started to talk more in front of beauties, stayed silent without even cracking a joke.</p><br/><p>It was no different for Tae Ho that he looked at Hestia with devoted eyes.</p><br/><p>But it seemed that Hestia felt this atmosphere to be rather stiff that she brought another subject first.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster of Asgard, there are a lot of things we have to speak about but closing the distance between us should come first. Fortunately, Athena told me something you like a lot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho asked back unconsciously and Cuchulainn opened his eyes widely in surprise.</p><br/><p>After a while, the words that came out of Hestia\u2019s mouth gaave Tae Ho more embarrassment.</p><br/><p>What the master of Asgard, Tae Ho, liked a lot.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a meeting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hestia spoke gently and Athena, that was standing far away, nodded with a satisfied face.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 55 \u2013 The legion of the main God (2) &gt; End</p><hr/><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/><p>Episode 55/Chapter 3: The legion of the main God (3)</p><br/><p>TL: Tsubak</p><br/><p>ED:</p><hr/><br/><p>Long ago, the king of the Titans Chronos had relationships with his sister and wife Rhea and bore several children.</p><br/><p>But he feared that someone that surpassed him got born among his children so everytime they were born he commited the atrocity of eating them whole.</p><br/><p>Rhea couldn\u2019t endure her children getting eaten by Chronos everytime they were born so she asked for help to her mother Gaia and saved Zeus.</p><br/><p>She had changed Zeus with a big rock before Chronos ate him.</p><br/><p>Thanks to that Zeus managed to keep his life and grew up between the nymphs Gaia had chosen and became a really powerful God and thought about defeating his father Chronos that may one day seek his life.</p><br/><p>Zeus got the help of his mother Rhea to rescue his brothers that were caught inside Chronos but they came out in the opposite way they entered so the one that got eaten first ended up getting out last.</p><br/><p>Due to this, the rank the children of Chronos and Rhea got overturn completely.</p><br/><p>The youngest Zeus became the eldest and the fifth, Poseidon, became the second and obtained strength and authority that was the strongest next to Zeus.</p><br/><p>In the other hand, the eldest Hestia became the youngest and her rank and authority became the lowest among the six siblings.</p><br/><p>But even if that was the case she was still the sister of Zeus. There was no one that could treat her divinity and deity lightly.</p><br/><p>In addition, Hestia was a possessor of a really compassionate and virtuous character compared to certain Gods of Olympus. She also had looks that were so outstanding she received proposal from Poseidon and Apollo at the same time so actually there was no one that didn\u2019t admire her.</p><br/><p>That person said that it was a meeting with a gentle expression and placed her lips lightly on Tae Ho\u2019s forehead.</p><br/><p>\u201cShall my blessing accompany you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hestia\u2019s smile was soft and warm like the breeze in spring. He felt like his impurities were being cleansed just by looking at it.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hey, are you okay? You don\u2019t feel like you got purified and want to ascend to heaven?\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho ignored Cuchulainn like usual and cleared his throat. He suppressed his embarrassment and answered simply.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank\u2026.you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Hey hey, why can\u2019t you meet her eyes? Huh?\u2019</p><br/><p>Because he was embarrassed. To say that it was a meeting from the start. In addition, to say that it was the thing he liked most.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, even if it\u2019s true it\u2019s still embarrassing.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn\u2019s words hit the spot precisely like always.</p><br/><p>But it was at that moment. Hestia misunderstood that Tae Ho was suffering of the embarrassment and put a really sorry face.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster of Asgard, I\u2019m really sorry. I should have prepared a place for you to rest as you have come after a fierce battle. Please forgive my unworthiness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her voice clearly showed her guilt. Because of that Tae Ho felt guilt instead of her and spoke hurriedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, no. It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s not Hestia-nim\u2019s fault.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I broke the turn of things because I was in a hurry. I will prepare a place at least now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m really fine. There are many things we have to talk about the current situation of Olympus. I can put behind resting for now.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Tae Ho smiled awkwardly and answered, Hestia looked at that Tae Ho for a moment and then said while her eyes reddened.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor the master of Asgard to think of Olympus like this\u2026..I can only be grateful to you as a Goddess of Olympus.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed like she got really moved.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn clicked his tongue when he saw her shed tears.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hey, doesn\u2019t your conscience hurt?\u2019</p><br/><p>Of course it did.</p><br/><p>But Tae Ho just received the situation instead of suffering and rather found a positive point.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m glad anyways.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018What? That you sold your consciousness long ago?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018That she got registered well. Is it because I became the master? Or because I obtained a deity? I feel like the completion rate is increasing better than before.\u2019</p><br/><p>[Goddess of hearth]</p><br/><p>[Hestia]</p><br/><p>He only had one meeting with her but the completion rate increased so much he felt like he could summon her right now. It seemed like his deity certainly played a big role.</p><br/><p>In the other hand, Cuchulainn got dumbfounded at Tae Ho\u2019s claim and yelled hurriedly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hestia-nim! Open your eyes! This bastard isn\u2019t what you think!\u2019</p><br/><p>It of course didn\u2019t reach her. Hestia tidied up her eyes with the handkerchief Tae Ho lent her and then put a bright smile to lead the group to their seats and started to speak after serving them tea she heated in the hearth.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster of Asgard, I will tell you what I know for now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hestia spoke about the things that happened the past two months.</p><br/><p>Two months ago, she got out of her secluded life and got out to the world when she noticed the change in the mount of Olympus.</p><br/><p>But there wasn\u2019t particularly anything she could do aside from rescuing Hermes as she didn\u2019t have any heroes under her.</p><br/><p>But she still tried her best to change the situation to become better and didn\u2019t just sit back and watch.</p><br/><p>She had started to treat Hermes\u2019 injuries and prepare for the days to come.</p><br/><p>The shelter the group of Tae Ho got led to was one of Hestia\u2019s efforts.</p><br/><p>When Hestia finished speaking about the past she started to speak about the present.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe news about the death of Ares should be spread far away already. Sparta and the several polises under him must have been liberated. But I think that there is no one that knows that you have awakened as the master of Asgard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it because it occurred in the underworld?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, you are right. The underworld is the territory of Hades so there\u2019s a high probability Poseidon or Artemis don\u2019t know how and by whom Ares got defeated. We also wouldn\u2019t have known about it if it wasn\u2019t for Athena, that has a connection with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>You could say that the underworld was another world that was separate from the ground. In the first place, the reason Tae Ho could spread the \u2018Hall of Valhalla\u2019 comparatively easily was because he was at the underworld, a neutral region.</p><br/><p>If it was like Hestia had said, they were in a really favorable situation.</p><br/><p>But Tae Ho didn\u2019t reach to hasty conclusions. There was something he got able to feel more clearly thanks to having become the master.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you talking about Zeus?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even if the underworld was a separate world it was still a world inside of Olympus. There was a high probability the master of Olympus, Zeus, felt something.</p><br/><p>Hestia shrunk her shoulder slightly at Tae Ho\u2019s question and answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s impertinent to say this\u2026..but even i\u2019m not certain. If it was the usual Zeus he would have known of it but the current Zeus is in a really chaotic state.\u201d</p><br/><p>He did send Achilles to attack the group but he hadn\u2019t completely turned into a being wanting to destroy the world. Zeus was still struggling desperately as the master of Olympus.</p><br/><p>But he was in a situation he would one day turn completely. Because of that, they had to change the situation to become more favorable before thathappened.</p><br/><p>\u201cArtemis is currently attacking violently the polises of Apollo. Fortunately, the damages aren\u2019t that big as Apollo ordered them to escape rather than fight back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only a few days had passed since she started attacking but already quite a lot of polises and villages had passed to her hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cPoseidon is erasing from the world all of the polises near the shores. His dependents that surged up from the sky are invading the west with the monsters in the ground so the damages are actually overwhelming.\u201d</p><br/><p>Poseidon had continued attacking even while Tae Ho\u2019s group moved to the entrance of the underworld. You could see that he had completely turned into a being wanting to destroy the world compared to Zeus.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe army of Zeus has begun to move on several regions. They are gathering the army of the east so they will start marching in no time.\u201d</p><br/><p>What was fortunate was that Ares died and Sparta got liberated from him. Sparta, that should have made up the core of the army of the east, had floated up into the air so a considerable setback would be created in the plan of the enemies.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho held his silence for a moment.</p><br/><p>He had defeated Ares and awakened as the master but the situation was still bad.</p><br/><p>All the Gods that had turned into beings waiting to destroy the world were strong and in the other side the Gods wanting to maintain the world had their divinities to weakened they could barely maintain themselves.</p><br/><p>In addition the dominion of polises was also bad so they were in an absolute disadvantage in numbers.</p><br/><p>But Tae Ho didn\u2019t despair. Now that he had become the master of Asgard, the range of options he had had widened just like he had told Adenmaha. There were still things he could go.</p><br/><p>\u201cHestia-nim, and Athena-nim. There\u2019s something I want to ask.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hestia tilted her head at Tae Ho\u2019s question but then stuttered an answer. She knew the answer and that\u2019s why she replied to Tae Ho but it seemed like she didn\u2019t know why he was asking her that.</p><br/><p>But it was different for Athena. She knew the meaning behind Tae Ho\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt will be fun.\u201d</p><br/><p>A smile got drawn in her face.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>Artemis frowned.</p><br/><p>Four days since Ares died.</p><br/><p>She made the troop that was attacking the polises of Apollo retreat.</p><br/><p>The reason was simple.</p><br/><p>\u2018Idun\u2019s warrior.\u2019</p><br/><p>There were only two strong Goddess that had legions among the several Gods of Asgard.</p><br/><p>The Goddess of magic Freya and the Goddess of life and youth Idun.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t Freya\u2019s warrior so the conclusion that he was Idun\u2019s warrior came up naturally.</p><br/><p>\u2018He killed Ares.\u2019</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t even imagine how he killed him. He was strong but he was merely someone that had just become a top ranked warrior.</p><br/><p>It was more proper to think that Hades had killed Ares just like Dionysius had thought.</p><br/><p>But Artemis thought differently. You could say that it was her sense as a hunter.</p><br/><p>Even if Idun\u2019s warrior didn\u2019t defeat Ares directly, he would have certainly played a decisive role.</p><br/><p>Idun\u2019s warrior.</p><br/><p>He killed Orion and Meleager. He made Delphos fall and massacred several children of Ares. He didn\u2019t stop at deceiving Artemis but also saved Athena.</p><br/><p>Artemis bit her lips. It seemed like her displeasure transformed into a snake and swirled in her body.</p><br/><p>\u2018He will come\u2019</p><br/><p>It was proper to think that he would aim for her that was the closest now that Ares had died. It was also a method to recover Apollo\u2019s divine power so he would certainly come for her.</p><br/><p>\u201cSet up the defenses solidly. Don\u2019t slack on the vigilance be it day or night.\u201d</p><br/><p>She ordered her heroes with the great hero Atalante at the lead. The monsters that entered her rank also took perfect defensive stance.</p><br/><p>Artemis also prepared herself. She armed herself completely and then connected the power of her sacred force into one. She was confident to intercept him no matter where he came from.</p><br/><p>\u2018Come if you dare. This place will become your grave!\u2019</p><br/><p>Artemis clenched her fist under the bright moonlight and put a confident smile.</p><br/><p>And at the same time, Adenmaha spoke with a worried voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, there\u2019s really no need to go to Artemis?\u201d</p><br/><p>This should be the most ideal time to attack her.</p><br/><p>But Tae Ho shook his head. It was because it was indeed an ideal time to attack her but actually that wasn\u2019t the case at all if you looked at the big picture.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe must be raising her defenses solidly. Striking her when they get exhausted and their defenses slack is the most appropriate.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no reason to touch a porcupine that has raised all of its thorns. They also didn\u2019t have an urgent reason to attack Artemis.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe should reinforce ourselves when she hasn\u2019t gotten a hold of herself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hermes was looking for Demeter and Hephaestus. They had to know where they were at to be able to rescue them.</p><br/><p>Hermes said that he would give them an answer at least in ten days.</p><br/><p>Ten days.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t short. It didn\u2019t make sense for them to be playing in that time.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why Tae Ho asked something to Athena and Hestia and could hear a satisfactory answer from them.</p><br/><p>\u201cHydra.\u201d</p><br/><p>The venomous dragon that had strong poison, nine heads and regeneration powers that was close to infinite.</p><br/><p>The hydra that got defeated by the strongest hero of Olympus, Heracles, got buried under a mountain of boulders for hundreds of years.</p><br/><p>\u201cPoor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg felt a compassionate pain and said with a teary face. Tae Ho stroke her head and clenched his fists.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s save Hydra. Okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! I will work hard!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg nodded and resoluted herself. It seemed like she was about to roll right now.</p><br/><p>ANd Siri, that was looking at the two of them, said with a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad Hydra is a male.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Right.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn agreed and Adenmaha nodded.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 55 \u2013 The legion of the main God (3) &gt; End</p><hr/><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/>\n</div>"}

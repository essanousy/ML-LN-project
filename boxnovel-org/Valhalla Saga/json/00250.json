Tae Ho got surprised at the change that started from his fingers and turned to look at him.</p><br/><p>Tongtian Jiaozhu smiled. He looked at Tae Ho and saw the existence rising up from behind Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wanted to return to the cosmos if possible. But that\u2019s all wrong now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tongtian Jiaozhu was a destructive being. His final wish was the annihilation of everything in the world including himself.</p><br/><p>But that wasn\u2019t a simple annihilation or destruction.</p><br/><p>What he wished was returning to the Void of Chaos that was the state before everything started to get born.</p><br/><p>He also didn\u2019t want to die in this way.</p><br/><p>Tongtian Jiaozhu\u2019s hands and feet almost disappeared. He spoke while his long and black beard which was his pride also scatter to scatter.</p><br/><p>\u201cA simple destruction will take place. That would have quite some distance with returning to the void.\u201d</p><br/><p>Destruction and extinction were different things. You couldn\u2019t reach the void just by destroying and erasing things.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho was the master of Erin. Because of that, he could vaguely sense what was happening in front of his eyes.</p><br/><p>Tongtian Jiaozhu\u2019s extinction was meant to maintain the being that was rising up from far away. The price for the final incantation was the life of the commander of Kum Oh Do, the one leading the destructive beings of the Temple.</p><br/><p>Then, what was the existence that rose up due to that?</p><br/><p>Tae Ho thought about attacking Tongtian Jiaozhu for a moment there but he discarded that idea. That was only a waste of strength. The current Tongtian Jiaozhu was merely an empty shell.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wanted to return to the void.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tongtian Jiaozhu left his last words and closed his eyes. He turned to ash with a grievous expression and scattered.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho looked at the existence that was arising by splitting the sea of fog. It wasn\u2019t as big as Nidhogg but it was still huge. The being he saw with his \u2018eyes of the dragon\u2019 seemed like it was about 600 meters tall.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s arms were long and it\u2019s body was also big. It was supporting its body with its arms just like a gorilla.</p><br/><p>It had a head but it didn\u2019t have a face. There was only bare lump of flesh on its face so you couldn\u2019t find its eyes, nose, lips, etc.</p><br/><p>It even had wings on its back. It had small and big wings in an irregular pattern. The small ones looked as poor as feathers and the big ones were as big as Nidhogg\u2019s wings and they were touching the ground.</p><br/><p>That thing raised its head and let out a soundless roar. All of Kum Oh Do fell silent and the sea of fog scattered and the floor showed up.</p><br/><p>It was an overwhelming strength. Tae Ho felt he could understand why Tongtian Jiaozhu had said that the only thing left now was destruction.</p><br/><p>The existence that was on the same level as Tiamat.</p><br/><p>The God of destruction that would drive everything to annihilation.</p><br/><p>But the situation was different from when they had to fight Tiamat in the Temple even though it belonged to Dilmun. That being had its origin in the Temple. That\u2019s why you could say that it was an existence that was a step above Tiamat in the Golden Palace.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho gulped dry saliva and then that thing let out a soundless roar once again.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho grabbed Astelone and the Sword of the roundtable more tightly. He turned to look at Siri and Bracky that were at the ground and then flew towards Nidhogg.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>Hyunwoo Cheon looked up at the existence that arose from the sea of fog. He knew better than anyone what that being was.</p><br/><p>Hundun, the God of Chaos, was born from the primordial chaos and the moment Hundun died order got created. And the one that was born from inside that order was the ancient giant Pangu.</p><br/><p>Pangu wasn\u2019t a being that wanted to maintain the world nor a destructive being. He was a being that had all two tendencies in one body.</p><br/><p>Pangu, that has shouldered the skies, supported the sky for 18.000 years and then lost his life as he ran out of strength. But then, his corpse became a new ingredient for the world.</p><br/><p>Yuanshi Tianzun, the master of the Temple and one of the highest deities, was someone that was born again with the soul of Pangu.</p><br/><p>The side of Pangu of wanting to maintain the world got reincarnated as Yuanshi Tianzun.</p><br/><p>When Tongtian Jiaozhu realized that, he concentrated on the remaining soul and flesh of Pangu. The maintaining side became Yuanshi Tianzun so he simply calculated that the remaining side would be a destructive one.</p><br/><p>And actually, all the destructive beings under Tongtian Jiaozhu and he included were originated from the soul and body of Pangu so it was a really probable speculation.</p><br/><p>That thought wasn\u2019t wrong. Tongtian Jiaozhu gathered the remaining soul and flesh of Pangu. In addition, he added the traces of the real ancient God of chaos Hundun to create another existence.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t wish for an existence that would return everything to the primordial chaos at once. What Tongtian Jiaozhu hoped for was a strong existence that could overwhelm the beings that wanted to maintain the world.</p><br/><p>But his wish was only fulfilled partly.</p><br/><p>The being that got created was certainly strong. He was a being that could sweep away all of the gang of Kunlun and more.</p><br/><p>But it couldn\u2019t be controlled. It only destroyed and kept destroying things and was a God of destruction that was long ways apart from returning things to the primordial chaos.</p><br/><p>Tongtian Jiaozhu placed that thing that only needed the final step to complete it, deep under the sea of fog and put it to sleep. It was a force that couldn\u2019t be controlled at all but he had left it as the final card of Kum Oh Do.</p><br/><p>Hyunwoo Cheon looked up at that thing that stood tall like a mountain. It wasn\u2019t the shape of destruction he had hoped for but whatever the case, he still felt a bit of joy in the destruction that the world would face and took a deep breath.</p><br/><p>The thing that ended roaring turned around. It was to the direction Nidhogg was at, just like Hyunwoo Cheon wished.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>Adenmaha, that looked outside through the huge screen inside the heart room, embraced Nidhogg tightly. The being that had turned to their side was spreading its wings.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s calling for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg said once again and then raised her head. She blinked as if she had just woken up from her sleep and then looked at that thing with a scared face.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time for me to step up once again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hraesvelgr stood up after he woke up and spoke. Echidna glared at that thing reflected in the screen and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s stronger than Tiamat. We can\u2019t drop our guards. We have to join hands with master.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed like they would at least need the Hall of Valhalla.</p><br/><p>But that was only their wish. When Echidna finished speaking that thing charged forward. It closed the distance with Nidhogg in an instant like a lie.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrepare for the shock!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hraesvelgr yelled loudly and controlled the black holy dragon of Nidhogg. It was impossible to dodge it so they took a defensive stance and that being attacked the black dragon.</p><br/><p>It was a shock that transcended imagination. The black dragon didn\u2019t only get pushed back greatly but its defense also got broken. The moment the being clashed with the black dragon, it turned its body in the air regardless of its size to land on the ground and then let out a soundless roar once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cFace it!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Hraesvelgr yelled Nidhogg released her strength. The force of protection that surged from the black holy dragon clashed with the force of destruction.</p><br/><p>The world shook. Protection and destruction canceled each other but didn\u2019t disappear. It shook the ground and collapsed the skies to create another destruction.</p><br/><p>The being was smaller than the black dragon. But if you excluded the tail or neck its body size wasn\u2019t that much smaller from the black dragon.</p><br/><p>In addition, the size of its body was increasing. A crack seemed to form in its face but then a mouth got formed.</p><br/><p>This time the being yelled out loud. The fierce and loud sound that seemed to destroy everything held down the black dragon. At the same time it charged towards the black dragon again.</p><br/><p>\u201cUooooooo!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hraesvelgr roared and controlled the black dragon. The black dragon that turned its body in an instant slammed the being away with a strong tail sweep. The being that clashed in the ground destroyed the ground and rolled in it but stood up soon after that.</p><br/><p>\u201cFire!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg opened her mouth when Hraesvelgr ordered. The black dragon did the same and a strong power of destruction, the authority of the dragon the dragon breath got fired from the mouth of the black holy dragon.</p><br/><p>The being also opened its mouth and fired a force of destruction. The time it took to awaken it was slow but its destructive power was higher. It was possible because this place wasn\u2019t Asgard but the Temple.</p><br/><p>The powers of destruction exploded when they clashed and the black dragon got pushed behind. But the being advanced forward. It closed the distance once again when the holy dragon hesitated.</p><br/><p>\u201cKyak!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nidhogg screamed. It was because the being bit the neck of the black dragon with the teeth it created.</p><br/><p>The black dragon let out a pained scream. Hraesvelgr moved his hand hurriedly to hold down its head and at the same time punched its side.</p><br/><p>But the being didn\u2019t fall off. It created more teeth as if it would tear off the head of the black dragon for sure.</p><br/><p>But it was at that moment.</p><br/><p>The sound of thunder silenced the sky. And the attack that was one step ahead of that sound hit the head of the being.</p><br/><p>Kwagang!</p><br/><p>The thing that got fired with lightning was Gae Bolg. Gae Bolg was too small compared to its size but the power behind it was really overwhelming.</p><br/><p>The huge lightning that fell after Gae Bolg made the being lose its strength although for a moment and Hraesvelgr didn\u2019t miss that opening. He moved his hand again and threw it away.</p><br/><p>[\u201cTae Ho master!\u201d]</p><br/><p>Nidhogg yelled through the black dragon and Tae Ho reacted instantly. He circulated Nidhogg and activated the \u2018Hall of Valhalla\u2019.</p><br/><p>A white light appeared from the body of the black dragon. The five pillars that got ejected from the black dragon took place in their surroundings and then the aura of Asgard started to spread.</p><br/><p>The body of the black dragon got smaller but she, that was proclaimed as the real protector of Asgard, got faster and stronger than before.</p><br/><p>Hraesvelgr let out a magnanimous laughter as if it was done now. But Tae Ho couldn\u2019t do that. It was because the being had also changed appearances.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho didn\u2019t know it but what formed that being was the body and soul of the giant Pangu. And the world called the Temple was also formed with the body of Pangu.</p><br/><p>That thing started to absorb part of the world. It devoured the sky and the ground as if it was trying to increase the size it was lacking.</p><br/><p>The being started to take an appearance similar to the black dragon. Its neck got longer and it started to grow a tail. The change took place in an instant so there was no time to defend against it at all.</p><br/><p>The monster that devoured the entire sea of fog and made the surroundings clearer obtained a body comparable to the black dragon. It didn\u2019t care about the aura of Asgard filling the surroundings and charged towards the black dragon. Even though the \u2018Hall of Valhalla\u2019 was spread, the sky still belonged to the Temple and the outside of the pillars was also the Temple.</p><br/><p>The black dragon clashed against that. The force of protection clashed with the force of destruction once again and it shook all of Kum Oh Do.</p><br/><p>\u2018She\u2019s getting pushed back.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn said. The judgment of the master of Scathach\u2019s techniques wasn\u2019t wrong. Tae Ho also thought the same way.</p><br/><p>What did he have to do then? How would he stop the God of destruction of the Temple Kum Oh Do had prepared?</p><br/><p>Not fighting was also a method. The only place it was able to show an absolute strength was on the Temple so if they returned to Asgard and closed the connecting path then it wouldn\u2019t pose a problem.</p><br/><p>But he couldn\u2019t choose that option. Asgard couldn\u2019t leave behind the Temple.</p><br/><p>Several arms and limbs appeared from its body. The limbs that could be seen as tentacles got extended forward and chocked and hit several places of the body of the dragon.</p><br/><p>The black dragon struggled and released a power of protection. It suppressed the being although for a moment. Then, it started to devour the world even more. Part of it was because of the aftereffects of the battle that nothing could be seen near the two monsters fighting. It was the result of the monster having absorbed everything on land.</p><br/><p>That thing got bigger. Nidhogg called out to Tae Ho and he activated the sentences of Erin and Asgard at the same time to use the \u2018Sword of creation\u2019.</p><br/><p>But it was at that moment.</p><br/><p>Astelone opened her mouth. She said.</p><br/><p>You can do it.</p><br/><p>What?</p><br/><p>The voice followed. It didn\u2019t belong to Astelone this time. It was the voice of someone else.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg also heard that and the same went for Echidna.</p><br/><p>The voice told them. The way to overcome this situation. A way to completely awaken Nidhogg\u2019s potential.</p><br/><p>It was possible because they had the Dragon sword Astelone. It was the result of Astelone having interacted with the owner of the voice. If only one of them existed, then they wouldn\u2019t have been able to find it.</p><br/><p>[\u201cTae Ho master!\u201d]</p><br/><p>Nidhogg yelled once again. She released the force of protection once again and pushed back the being. The hit it with the dragon breath and bought time for a moment.</p><br/><p>That thing absorbed the world with a scarier intent. Tae Ho didn\u2019t hesitate anymore. He followed Astelone\u2019s voice and the other voice that got added and looked at Nidhogg.</p><br/><p>At that moment Echidna realized it. Who was the one calling her and Nidhogg. Where was the voice coming from.</p><br/><p>Nuwa.</p><br/><p>The ancient God of the Temple.</p><br/><p>The ancient dragon that had fallen asleep long ago.</p><br/><p>When Tongtian Jiaozhu created that thing, he used Nuwa to become the pivot existence in it. He covered her with the soul of Pangu and Hundun on her as she couldn\u2019t move because she was in a deep slumber and created that.</p><br/><p>Nuwa was speaking inside that. The incarnation of the World dragon Astelone was communicating with her.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho reached the heart room in an instant and grabbed Astelone more tightly. It was to execute the method she had taught him.</p><br/><p>Adenmaha let go Nidhogg from her embrace. Nidhogg embraced Tae Ho hurriedly and then extended her hand and grabbed Astelone with him.</p><br/><p>And at that moment Tae Ho got to realize.</p><br/><p>No, perhaps he may have only realized now something he had already known from before.</p><br/><p>Astelone laughed as if he only realized that now. Adenmaha called Tae Ho\u2019s name from behind. The monster was trying to fire a force of destruction through its mouth.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho stopped thinking and concentrated on what was in front of him. He interacted with Nidhogg through the \u2018one that conquers dragons\u2019. He concentrated strength on Astelone and then struck it in the ground with Nidhogg.</p><br/><p>They activated the saga of the Dragon sword Astelone.</p><br/><p>[Creation ranked saga]</p><br/><p>[The dragon protecting the world]</p><br/><p>White light exploded from Astelone. At the same time, blinding light got emanated from the black dragon.</p><br/><p>The black holy dragon Nidhogg. The ancient dragon that decided to protect Asgard.</p><br/><p>One more force got added on top of that.</p><br/><p>The power of the world.</p><br/><p>The power that protects the world where the beings that wanted to maintain the world had won completely.</p><br/><p>The black dragon roared under the light. No, that wasn\u2019t a black holy dragon anymore.</p><br/><p>What awoke after it got stimulated with the power of protection was a being that transcended an ancient dragon.</p><br/><p>The World dragon, Nidhogg.</p><br/><p>The one that protects Asgard.</p><br/><p>Nidhogg, that got covered in white light, roared. It hit the God of destruction of the Temple with the power of Asgard.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 70 \u2013 Sword of the World Dragon (5) &gt; End</p><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/>\n</div>"}

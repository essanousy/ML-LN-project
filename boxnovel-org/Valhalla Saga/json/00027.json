Heda spoke in a low voice after listening to Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow peculiar.\u201d</p><br/><p>For none other than Rasgrid to let an inferior ranked warrior get on top of her. For Heda, that normally knew Rasgrid, that was a difficult thing to even imagine.</p><br/><p>However, Tae Ho that didn\u2019t know that just tilted his head and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe dragon wing coat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, not that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda shook her head slowly and just let it end there. Tae Ho looked at her as if it was weird but decided to ask another thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, Heda. Do you also have dragon wing coat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I just have a swan wing coat. The dragon wing coatisre really precious things.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Unfortunate.\u2019</p><br/><p>The capabilities of the dragon wing coat were really amazing. Because it let you transform into a dragon just like its name implied. But it wasn\u2019t that he wanted to particularly ride on Heda after she transformed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmhm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. Nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Tae Ho also spoke ambiguously Heda didn\u2019t ask further. But instead, she asked something once again just like Tae Ho did.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is your body? Just from what I heard it seemed like it was a really big battle.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, actually\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho paused and then showed Heda the pocket he had in his waist. It was obviously an empty pocket.</p><br/><p>Heda raised her voice at the part that Tae Ho cleared up all of the apple pieces in an instant.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy God! Are you really fine?\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda approached Tae Ho and hurriedly checked the state of his body. And fortunately, she didn\u2019t find any big wounds. No, rather he was healthiness itself.</p><br/><p>\u201cI ate all of the pieces at once. I also have this. Oh, also your blessing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho smirked and then pointed his forehead and Idun\u2019s necklace.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa\u2026 Really.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda let out a sigh of relief and stepped back and after that, she spread the empty pocket she took from Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cI should ask for some more however I can.\u201d</p><br/><p>She was obviously talking about the pieces. Tae Ho saw Heda\u2019s look and asked carefully.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that going a bit far?\u201d</p><br/><p>The pieces of golden apples were really precious items. However, Heda shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe only warrior I\u2019m in charge of is pushing himself, so I also have to do the same. However precious it is, what worth is there if you just store it? The people that need it should use it, am I wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>If the other Valkyries had heard her, there would have been a fuss but Heda really thought like that.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways, it seems like your body is fine because you ate it all at once. I think that you probably won\u2019t even be able to sleep for 3 days. You are overflowing with strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though he had gone through an all-day battle and the night was deep he didn\u2019t even feel the slightest bit of exhaustion. And he thought that it would stay the same if he didn\u2019t sleep this day.</p><br/><p>\u2018It certainly isn\u2019t a normal item.\u2019</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t only revive him right before dead but it also had this amazing effect.</p><br/><p>While Heda saw Tae Ho admiring it she clapped and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, let\u2019s go with classes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are thorough.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the task of a Valkyrie.\u201d</p><br/><p>Whether others said they were having a meeting or not, they couldn\u2019t waste the precious time they had.</p><br/><p>Heda said bluntly and then grabbed the most important point.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said that the synchro rate increased a lot, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s already at 13%.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you realize something new?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like the completion is different for each saga. Although the immortal warrior is 13% the charge of a warrior is just like a storm feels like 20%~30%. Or even more than that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, that\u2019s plentily possible. Because there are other smaller sagas below the big saga, immortal warrior.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no rule that said that the synchro rate increased in groups. And for the first time, the length of the contents of each saga and how famous it was, was also different. It would be stranger for it to increase at the same rate.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are also changes in the completion rate increased, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel like I can do more things with them.\u201d</p><br/><p>He could see more things with the eyes of a dragon and the charge of the warrior started to get accompanied by wind. For the warrior\u2019s sword, he would be able to make a stronger weapon than Runefang.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m expecting for its completion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho also nodded. Because differently from Heda, he could more or less guess the completion of his saga. Especially, the thing he expected the most was the warrior\u2019s charge.</p><br/><p>\u2018Because of that day, Kalsted was really a storm.\u2019</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t merely accompanied by wind. The charge of the warrior is just like a storm had a strength beyond that.</p><br/><p>As strength was put in Tae Ho\u2019s eyes Heda smiled once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no news of a new saga?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere was one more empty slot added. But I\u2019m thinking of saving it. It seems like the saga I can make is influenced by the synchro rate.\u201d</p><br/><p>When his synchro rate was below 5% he couldn\u2019t create the saga the one that handles dragons. Although he couldn\u2019t know the exact standards, he just sensed when he could make it or not.</p><br/><p>Heda also nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, listening to you, you overcame the crisis through the one that handles dragons. If you don\u2019t have a saga you need immediately, it also won\u2019t be bad to create one at the spot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although it was different to what she had said previously, the two things she had said had logic behind it.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you should still think thoroughly about it. Understood?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thinking about things like this was the specialty of the progamer Lee Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>At the fresh answer of Tae Ho, Heda nodded in satisfaction.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, so let\u2019s calculate. You earned a lot of runes, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAn overwhelming amount.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho smirked and spread his chest as if telling her to check quickly. Heda gulped dry saliva as if preparing herself and then placed her palm on his chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, really.\u201d</p><br/><p>A smile appeared on Heda\u2019s face. When she had checked for the last time, he now had about four times since then.</p><br/><p>Even though the runes were divided by everyone that had defeated it, it was still this much. In addition, the things Tae Ho had weren\u2019t normal runes.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere were also special runes, how do I use them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Among the ones he had accumulated, there was one green rune. And this was the real reason Heda put on a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an attribute rune. If you accumulate them, the respective attribute becomes stronger so it is of help when you use magic or saga. This one is earth attributed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, attributes. How many are there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGathering them all, 9. Earth, wind, fire, water, thunder, light, darkness, life, death.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda extended one finger every time she named one attribute and mumbled in a low voice. After that, the shape of the green rune appeared on Heda\u2019s palm.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf your attribute becomes stronger, then its characteristic is reflected in you. The earth attribute is related to health and defense.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was something he understood in an instant. Because the giant he faced was really sturdy.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways, it\u2019s a good thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s also precious.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Tae Ho resumed it simply Heda nodded quickly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd\u2026..um, Tae Ho. Don\u2019t invest all of the runes this time, will you save some?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like there are other uses for it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I was thinking about making you learn rune magic. Immediate strengthening of your stats if good, but there are several rune magic that is plentily useful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda didn\u2019t tell Tae Ho to become a magician. Tae Ho understood Heda\u2019s words and nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt would be good to learn as an assistant. It seems like we can\u2019t learn it right here, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need a ceremony or a procedure. I will teach it to you later when you return to the legion.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I will bother you with that.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Tae Ho agreed, Heda started to speak about the how many runes should he leave. After investing the remaining runes equally, Heda let out a sigh and then fixed her expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s end the classes here and talk about the path you should take.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018She\u2019s really like a teacher from school.\u2019</p><br/><p>But of course, there was no one like Heda when Tae Ho went to school.</p><br/><p>\u2018If there were, I would have gone to Seoul University.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing, nothing. Let\u2019s do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Tae Ho showed the will to do it so suddenly, Heda tilted her head for a moment but then started to speak again.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen you return, you will be promoted to an inferior ranked warrior. To become an inferior ranked warrior you need a number of merits and a set amount of accumulated runes, but you already far surpassed that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are no tests for that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s none when you become an inferior rank. You can say that achieving merits and accumulating runes is a test by itself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, doing a test or an interview would be weirder.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho laughed when he thought of the warriors of Valhalla solving their test sheets. It was also the same for the interview scene.</p><br/><p>As Tae Ho laughed, Heda also laughed and then proceeded with what she was saying.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere will be more warriors that will be promoted this time. They should probably be your brothers.\u201d</p><br/><p>The first one he could think of was Bracky. He had achieved more merits than him in the expedition of the Black Fortress, and he had clearly achieved big merits when defeating the giant.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a high probability for you to go to the next battlefield with them. Of course, there may be some that got promoted in another place and also warriors that were originally inferior ranked so you will see unfamiliar faces. Even so, the situation should be better than this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Will I be able to keep seeing captain Siri?\u2019</p><br/><p>If possible, he wanted to keep being with her.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like you have comrades you want to stay with, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt will turn out well. For them to have been with you means that they have also performed greatly.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was also a right word. In addition, Rolph wasn\u2019t a lowest ranked warrior that went to his first expedition. He should have the merits and runes he had collected previously, so there was a high probability for him to get promoted this time too.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, so we finished everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks for your trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>After he bowed playfully, Heda didn\u2019t end the meeting or bless him as usual but instead put on a troubled face.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, but you know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying this just in case\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda turned her head as if checking her surroundings and then approached Tae Ho and whispered.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou musn\u2019t go over Odin\u2019s legion even if Rasgrid seduces you. Understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>At her voice that was filled with earnest and embarrassment, Tae Ho opened his eyes widely.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can even move legions?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cN, no. Not normally. But Rasgrid is a Valkyrie Odin treasures and also has a high position. So she can push things.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t think she would.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was none other than Rasgrid. He couldn\u2019t imagine Rasgrid humiliating herself that easily.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways, you understood right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda grabbed Tae Ho\u2019s hand and said. It seemed like she was really troubled about that.</p><br/><p>But she was worried about nothing. Because Tae Ho didn\u2019t even have one reason to move over to Odin\u2019s legion.</p><br/><p>\u2018There are so many good points here in Idun\u2019s legion.\u2019</p><br/><p>He had saved his life twice thanks to Idun\u2019s blessing. The pieces of the golden apples were things he could receive it because he belonged to Idun\u2019s legion and most of all Heda was in the legion.</p><br/><p>However, Tae Ho said another thing instead of nodding immediately.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt depends on how you do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda opened her eyes widely at that moment but then she seemed to have read Tae Ho\u2019s thoughts that she smirked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen there shouldn\u2019t be any problems.\u201d</p><br/><p>She smiled brightly and after that stood on her toes and kissed Tae Ho\u2019s forehead. It was Heda\u2019s blessing that had even saved him once.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet Idun\u2019s blessing be with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet Idun\u2019s blessing be with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho repeated those words and the meeting ended like that on that day.</p><br/><p>And after one week, the moment the expedition team returned to Valhalla.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho returned to Idun\u2019s legion.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 7 \u2013 Valkyrie (5) &gt; End</p><br/>\n</div>"}

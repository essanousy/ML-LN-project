It was because a voice was heard from above when not even a minute had passed since he closed his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid everything end now?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was the voice of Hermes. When Tae Ho opened his eyes he saw Hermes extending his head from beyond the hole.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it seems so.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhew, i\u2019m glad. I only have the strength to return now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho couldn\u2019t see his face well because of the backlight but he felt like he could know how he was feeling just by listening to the relief in his voice.</p><br/><p>And actually Hermes was already at his limit.</p><br/><p>Even if he had the winged shoes Talaria, it wasn\u2019t that he could roam Olympus without any restrictions.</p><br/><p>He spent a few more times in strength when he was accompanied by one person and even if that was the case he was bringing Tae Ho with him when he was weakened because he lost his sacred force and took him to the sacred force of Artemis so his expenditure of strength was really big.</p><br/><p>If he said that he only had strength to return, that should be true.</p><br/><p>But it was at that moment. Cuchulainn said something different.</p><br/><p>\u2018He\u2019s afraid.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Hermes?\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho stood up while shaking off the dust from his but and asked. It seemed like he was asking him in agreement and not because he didn\u2019t know.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho had also noticed the uneasiness in Hermes\u2019 eyes and voice.</p><br/><p>\u2018Right, that\u2019s unavoidable. He couldn\u2019t even have imagined a sacred force getting attacked like this. He should be scared of us even if we won.\u2019</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that the fact of attacking a sacred force itself was unfamiliar. Actually Ares and Poseidon also attacked the sacred forces as they pleased.</p><br/><p>What Hermes was afraid of was that Tae Ho had turned several sacred forces into a mess in only a few hours and weakened Artemis drastically.</p><br/><p>Actually this wasn\u2019t something common.</p><br/><p>He could summon strong dragons through the summoning rocks, could find the nucleus of a sacred force through the \u2018eyes of the dragon\u2019 and destroy it by force thanks to Tae Ho having the strength of a master and was assisted by Hermes, that could roam Olympus freely.</p><br/><p>But even so he could only feel fear. If there was only Tae Ho, they could replace Hermes\u2019 role plentily.</p><br/><p>Hermes hadn\u2019t imagined the situation of Olympus being invaded just like Apollo warned Athena. It was more correct to say that he had felt an instinctive rejection towards Tae Ho when he saw a sacred force being destroyed as he also relied on it.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, that\u2019s not a common method. But this really is hard.\u2019</p><br/><p>Actually, Tae Ho hadn\u2019t been able to destroy the nucleus that easily. It took much more strength to destroy them perhaps because he was a foreign God and not a God of Olympus. In addition, he had used strong sagas in consecution so his mental fatigue was also great.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is this the first time I used the \u2018dragon cannon\u2019 four times in succession?\u2019</p><br/><p>In addition, he had just destroyed the ground in an ignorant way so his right arm was still numb.</p><br/><p>\u2018But what happened?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018What?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018That the seat of the God of sun itself wasn\u2019t handed over but you are sharing it with Athena. In addition, looking that you received the necklace\u2026.it looks like you received the same but the foundation went to Athena right?\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn was almost always with Tae Ho but he couldn\u2019t do that last night. It was because Apollo had requested him a one on one conversation.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho nodded at Cuchulainn\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes, I\u2019m also able to use the authority because I have this necklace but Athena should be able to use it even without this. She\u2019s now a Goddess of warfare and at the same time the Goddess of sun.\u2019</p><br/><p>The using right was divided in two but Athena had the ownership.</p><br/><p>\u2018That is the weird thing. Why did he do that? I don\u2019t think he did this to seduce Athena.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018His love towards his sister is praiseworthy.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018What nonsense are you spouting about? Are you someone that will let things pass just because of that? I wouldn\u2019t know if you threatened him saying that you will kill Artemis if he doesn\u2019t hand over his seat.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Hoho, this person is really crafty.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho stroke the beard he didn\u2019t have and laughed.</p><br/><p>It was obvious he was hiding something.</p><br/><p>\u2018What are you plotting? Just tell me at once.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I will tell you later.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Later when?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018At night?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster of Asgard?\u201d</p><br/><p>The voice of Hermes was heard once again from above. It seemed like he became anxious because Tae Ho wasn\u2019t coming out.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho answered suitably and then took a light leap and got out. The battle between Adenmaha and group had stopped maybe because the people of Artemis got liberated from her.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster of Asgard, we will depart now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hermes extended his hand towards Tae Ho. Tae Ho grabbed that and transmitted Adenmaha a mystical magic.</p><br/><p>[Adenmaha, I will leave Nidhogg and the group to you]</p><br/><p>[Don\u2019t worry. See you later]</p><br/><p>[Right. I\u2019m always grateful]</p><br/><p>[Hmph hmph]</p><br/><p>Tae Ho heard Adenmaha snorting in a good mood and closed his eyes. Hermes activated Talaria and surged up to the sky in an instant.</p><br/><p>And after some time passed.</p><br/><p>They arrived in front of the last polis of Apollo as they enjoyed the wind.</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you come master?\u201d</p><br/><p>When he came down slowly with Hermes several voices were heard.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho looked at his surroundings with his \u2018eyes of the dragon\u2019 before answering to each voice.</p><br/><p>The battle had already ended here but it seemed like the damages were bigger than we imagined.</p><br/><p>About a fifth of Echidna\u2019s army of dragons lost their lives and half of them suffered small and big injuries.</p><br/><p>Looking that half of the army of Artemis and Dionysus were dead, he could see how fierce the battle was in that short time.</p><br/><p>What was fortunate was that Bracky, Siri and the three Valkyries didn\u2019t have any injuries and were safe.</p><br/><p>But this didn\u2019t mean that no one got hurt.</p><br/><p>\u201cEchidna, are you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, you noticed?\u201d</p><br/><p>Echidna laughed bewitchingly as if nothing happened to her but Tae Ho frowned. It was because her injury wasn\u2019t one to be overlooked and pass it over a laugh.</p><br/><p>Even if she was the God of dragons, the divine power of the 12 Olympians was like poison for her as she was a monster. The wound itself got erased after she transformed into her Goddess appearance but she couldn\u2019t do anything about the divine power that got inserted through the arrow and suffered a big injury.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho smacked his lips out of regret and realized that his judgement had been wrong.</p><br/><p>Echidna was really strong when he faced her in the city of monsters. He had thought that she would be able to buy time without suffering any injuries if someone like her focused solely in defense.</p><br/><p>But that was a mistake.</p><br/><p>Echidna had become much more weaker than when she faced him.</p><br/><p>And this occurred because Tae Ho\u2019s understanding about sacred forces was low.</p><br/><p>The 12 Olympians could get assisted by the sacred forces even when they were far but they could receive a much bigger strength when they fought inside the sacred force.</p><br/><p>In the case of Echidna, the differences they posed was much more severe inside and outside the sacred force.</p><br/><p>In addition, she had offered her sacred force to Tae Ho. It was impossible for her strength to be the same from when she was the only owner of the sacred force and when she became a lesser God and split it with Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>The other miscalculation he had made was Artemis\u2019 strength. She had used several mystical magic to increase her battle power as she was determined to kill Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, and thank you for doing well.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Tae Ho grabbed Echidna\u2019s hands and spoke, she opened her eyes widely and spoke with an expectant voice as if seducing him.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh wow, then what about doing it tonight? Huh? Aren\u2019t you excited because you saw blood?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that it will wear out. How petty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho got away from Echidna while she grumbled and looked at Siri and Bracky. There was an unfamiliar woman standing between the two.</p><br/><p>[Artemis\u2019 great hero]</p><br/><p>[Atalante]</p><br/><p>The words weren\u2019t red but grey. She wasn\u2019t a being wanting to destroy the world as she had gotten out of Artemis\u2019 control.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the Great hero of Artemis, Atalante. Thanks to her we have been able to lessen our damages from the battle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri introduced Atalante herself and then explained about what happened after Artemis got sealed briefly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter Artemis got sealed, she commanded the army that fell in chaos and stopped the battle. It wasn\u2019t possible to control Dionysius army but they lost all strength after he disappeared so they weren\u2019t that troublesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even if she got liberated from Artemis, she was fighting against monsters that she fought her entire life so stopping the battle in an instant was an amazing judgement.</p><br/><p>While Tae Ho was admiring her, Siri looked at Atalante and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cAtalante, he\u2019s the master of Asgard Lee Tae Ho. Greet him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe great hero of Artemis, Atalante, greets the master of Asgard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Atalante placed her left fist in her right chest and greeted him in the Olympus way.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho replied back in the Valhalla way and looked at Atalante\u2019s eyes fixedly and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are able to avoid spilling unnecessary blood thanks to you. I am grateful to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cArtemis-nim\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Atalante put on a teary face but then closed her eyes trying to calm herself down and continued speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cArtemis-nim has told me at the last moment. That she was sorry\u2026..and if possible to help her brother\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Did she gain a hold of herself before she got sealed?\u2019</p><br/><p>The brother Artemis spoke about was certainly Apollo. As Cuchulainn got surprised and asked, Tae Ho remembered the eyes of Apollo he saw last night.</p><br/><p>\u2018Apollo\u2019s care may have worked.\u2019</p><br/><p>Because it was really an extreme love.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho turned to look at Apollo and Artemis that had become rock and were embracing each other. He could feel the extreme love also from Artemis\u2019 face.</p><br/><p>Atalante also turned to look at the two Gods and then expressed etiquette.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe army of Artemis-nim including me will enter the army of Athena-nim and help recapturing Olympus.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for your help. We welcome you and your comrades.\u201d</p><br/><p>Atalante and Tae Ho finished the greeting and then retrieved their forces after talking with Athena and headed to the polis of Apollo. They had many things to organize but resting came first now.</p><br/><p>Time flowed and the promised night came.</p><br/><p>\u2018What promised night? That sounds weird.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018You said you will tell me at night.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho sat on the bed after taking a nap and scratched his stomach. When he looked outside the window he noticed that it wasn\u2019t midnight yet but it was clearly late.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho used mystical magic on a kettle that was placed next to his bed to make cold water and then started speaking after drinking that.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, it\u2019s nothing impressive. I got something else instead of Athena receiving the seat of Goddess of sun.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Something else?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes, it didn\u2019t seem to be that important for Apollo and it seemed like he wanted to put at least one more reward\u2026..but actually for me this is more important than the seat of God of sun.\u2019</p><br/><p>The center of the negotiation was the seat of God of sun.</p><br/><p>That was what Apollo offered instead of him saving Artemis.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho showed displeasement about sharing the seat of God of sun with Athena and started to speak about several conditions for his request, and the result of that was that he got able to obtain what he wanted but in a way he had no other options but to accept it.</p><br/><p>If Tae Ho had requested him what he wanted from the beginning, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to share the seat of God of sun with Athena.</p><br/><p>\u2018So it means that you cheated on him like usual?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018What are you talking about? That\u2019s the skill of negotiating and trading.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018That\u2019s the same thing. So what did you get anyways?\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn showed a lot of interest. Thanks to that, Tae Ho got burdened and cleared his throat and answered after that.</p><br/><p>\u2018The seat of God of music.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018God of music?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes, God of music. Apollo is also the God of music. I haven\u2019t been able to receive it completely as i\u2019m also a God of a foreign world but I think I will be able to reach the level I desire in no time.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018What are you plann\u2026.ah!\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn let out an exclamation and Tae Ho smirked. He stuck out his tongue that had the rune of Bragi engraved in it.</p><br/><p>The rune of Bragi that was the God of music and poetry.</p><br/><p>What will happen if the God of music was added?</p><br/><p>The strengthening of his rune.</p><br/><p>Bragi\u2019s rune that will release a much stronger power.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s test it.\u2019</p><br/><p>How well his rune worked and how much it got strengthened.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho nodded and tried to get out of the room. Cuchulainn thought that he was going to use \u2018the warrior that had a Goddess meet him\u2019 so he blinked and asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hey, where are you going?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I want to try it on Adenmaha.\u2019</p><br/><p>How well would his words using the rune will work.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho answered calmly and Cuchulainn spoke with a sigh.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is that test meaningful at least?\u2019</p><br/><p>But Tae Ho ignored him and headed to Adenmaha\u2019s room.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 59 \u2013 God of conquest (1) &gt; End</p><br/>\n</div>"}

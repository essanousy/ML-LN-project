Ares moved his hand hurriedly to block Tae Ho\u2019s attack but it didn\u2019t matter. His feet and hands were stiff because of his continued bewilderment.</p><br/><p>Ares\u2019 defense was broken. Arondight hit his sword and Ares\u2019 right arm was pushed back as if being bounced back.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho took one more step. He entered Ares\u2019 range and poured out sword attacks.</p><br/><p>Red blood scattered. Thin and long wounds gouged Ares\u2019 steel like body.</p><br/><p>Ares felt pain. He stood on many battlefields as the God of war but he rarely got wounded.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why the pain was big. The physical pain got added to the pain in his heart and bore a bigger pain.</p><br/><p>How did this happen?</p><br/><p>How was the God of war suffering like this?</p><br/><p>Ares roared. The yell that had the dignity of a God behind it suppressed Tae Ho\u2019s attacks.</p><br/><p>Ares made a decision in the opening that was made. This was war. He wasn\u2019t planning on following Odin but he was also a God of war like him.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why he had to let himself go. He didn\u2019t have to worry about the price to win.</p><br/><p>The eyes of Ares started to become red. Ares didn\u2019t suppress himself. He released the instincts as a God of war that started to awaken after smelling blood.</p><br/><p>Ares let out a roar. The reason there were 2 Gods of war among the 12 Olympians was because they were in charge of different types of war.</p><br/><p>Athena directed the cold war that occurred in rational and conscious thoughts.</p><br/><p>She was a commander and was someone that ordered from behind rather than fighting at the front.</p><br/><p>Ares was different.</p><br/><p>He was a soldier. He relied more on his instincts and wild nature instead of rationality.</p><br/><p>No matter what kind of moral law and sweet words were added, in the end war was suppressing the opponent and forcing them to do what you wanted.</p><br/><p>It only had a simple principle of having to kill your enemy so that you could live.</p><br/><p>Because of that, no matter how much his techniques on war were developed, you still had a barbaric nature in your essence.</p><br/><p>Ares was the God of that barbaric nature.</p><br/><p>The principles of war.</p><br/><p>Suppressing the opponent with pure strength and a war where you sought the life of the opponent.</p><br/><p>Ares\u2019 father heated up in crimson once again. But that strength didn\u2019t only belong to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather!\u201d</p><br/><p>One of his children yelled as if despairing. He, who was born between Ares and a human queen and had admired him forever, let out a painful groan and collapsed.</p><br/><p>But that was only the start. The children of Ares that were facing the fake Valkyries groaned in pain and also collapsed. There were some that had their lives taken because strength left their bodies while fighting.</p><br/><p>The sister of Penthesilea, Hippolyta, let out a coughing sound and fell on her butt. She was born between Ares and a human but she was born with a particularly strong divinity and that\u2019s why she was able to maintain consciousness even now. She understood instinctively what was happening to them.</p><br/><p>Ares was retrieving the divinities of his children. No, you could say that it was like plundering and extorting.</p><br/><p>The ones that were born between Ares and humans collapsed first. After that, the ones that were born between nymphs did and lastly, the pure Gods that were born between two Gods collapsed in silence without even despairing.</p><br/><p>Hippolyta knew. The ones that were half humans could still living on as humans even if their divinities got taken but it was different for the pure Gods. Now that their divinities got taken away, they became so weak they could die at any moment. The closer they were to being a God the more strength they gave to Ares and the price of that was experiencing a heavier loss. There were some that actually got their lives taken away.</p><br/><p>Part of the children let out howls of resentment and some of them even started to curse out Ares.</p><br/><p>But Hippolyta was different. She was the daughter of the God of war and realized that the actions of her father, the God of war of Olympus weren\u2019t wrong.</p><br/><p>Because he was the God of war.</p><br/><p>He was a vicious God that exterminated the enemy in front of him!</p><br/><p>\u201cFather!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hippolyte offered her divinity gladly.</p><br/><p>She saw the divinities of the children that gathered in one and was being gathered to the God of war with eyes of delight.</p><br/><p>Ares roared. Even though the connection with mount Olympus and the sacred force got cut off, he transformed into the real God of war once again after devouring the divinities of his seventy or so children.</p><br/><p>It was an overwhelming strength. His sword regained its crimson color in an instant.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuoo!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ares roared and swung his sword. The entire Hall of Valhalla shook at his rough attack. It struggled at the power of the God of war that was running wild like a beast.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho barely dodged his sword. He concentrated and concentrated more.</p><br/><p>The concentrated divinity of Ares was really strong. It was much stronger than Tae Ho who had just awakened as the main God.</p><br/><p>But he didn\u2019t fear. He didn\u2019t even expect that things would somehow turn right.</p><br/><p>If Ares was the God of war Tae Ho was the God of battle.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho had already experienced more than a thousand times a battle against an opponent stronger than him.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho didn\u2019t block Ares\u2019 sword. He read the trajectory of his attacks with the \u2018eyes of the dragon\u2019 and focused on dodging.</p><br/><p>Ares chased him. The attacks were dodged but the power of the crimson light that swept up the surroundings obstructed Tae Ho\u2019s movements.</p><br/><p>The distance closed. The space by which Tae Ho dodged the sword became smaller.</p><br/><p>And at some point Tae Ho realized it.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t dodge this.</p><br/><p>The sword stabbing down above his head.</p><br/><p>The crimson red sword.</p><br/><p>But Tae Ho didn\u2019t give up. He didn\u2019t stop fighting in the time that fragmented.</p><br/><p>And there was something being transmitted to him.</p><br/><p>Something gave strength to him, the master of Asgard.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t lose.</p><br/><p>He heard a voice from the time that seemed to have stopped. Tae Ho realized who the voice belonged to and what was the strength behind it.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t lose!</p><br/><p>\u201cAdenmaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho yelled. It wasn\u2019t a physical yell. You could say that he yelled with his divinity.</p><br/><p>The strength that was transmitted from Adenmaha wasn\u2019t the power of Idun. It was the first prayer of Adenmaha that she offered to the God of battle, the master of Asgard.</p><br/><p>Ares had his children.</p><br/><p>And Tae Ho had Adenmaha. Nidhogg and the cocky Rolo.</p><br/><p>It was too small compared to the strength Ares gathered but it was enough. This place was Asgard and not Olympus. This place was Valhalla spread over Olympus!</p><br/><p>The sword of Ares grazed Tae Ho\u2019s side. It broke the ground and the crimson power exploded.</p><br/><p>But the aftershock couldn\u2019t affect Tae Ho. Tae Ho was already moving the moment the blade hit the ground.</p><br/><p>He ordered himself as the God of battles.</p><br/><p>Faster.</p><br/><p>Faster.</p><br/><p>Like a blowing gale.</p><br/><p>Like falling lightning!</p><br/><p>Kwagang.</p><br/><p>Blue electricity exploded and at the same time the rune of Bragi amplified the power of his saga.</p><br/><p>[Saga: The charge of the warrior is like a storm]</p><br/><p>Ares couldn\u2019t chase his movements. He ended up losing him even though he was right in front of him.</p><br/><p>The remaining thing was just blue electricity and then thunder erupted. The dark blue divinity bared its sharp fangs behind Ares.</p><br/><p>The crimson divinity covering Ares\u2019 body got torn off. Ares roared in pain and turned around and Tae Ho swung his sword once again towards him.</p><br/><p>Kagang!</p><br/><p>Gallatin collided against Ares\u2019 sword but didn\u2019t make a contest of strength. He used the skillful movements of Scathach\u2019s techniques to send Ares\u2019 sword flowing away. At the same time he swung his left hand and threw Arondight.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuak!\u201d</p><br/><p>Arondight tore Ares\u2019 shoulder and flew to the sky. Tae Ho then threw Gallatin and the sword of the sun stabbed Ares\u2019 stomach.</p><br/><p>Ares stepped back and swung his sword. It was an attack unleashed with his last resolution.</p><br/><p>But there was no sound. The sound of crushing Tae Ho or the sound of the ground being destroyed.</p><br/><p>Achilles\u2019 shield.</p><br/><p>Hephaestus\u2019 divine object shone with Idun\u2019s golden divinity. The power of life blocked the crimson power completely.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho swung his shield. It pushed away Ares\u2019 sword and then extended his left hand towards him.</p><br/><p>[Saga: Equipment of the dragon knight]</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t create a weapon to wield it. The sentence of the Milesian shone in Tae Ho\u2019s left hand and unleashed an attack Ares couldn\u2019t even imagine.</p><br/><p>Beginner short sword.</p><br/><p>Runefang.</p><br/><p>The sword of the winter wolf.</p><br/><p>All the weapons Tae Ho used until now. The weapons of Kalsted recorded in \u2018the equipment of the dragon knight\u2019.</p><br/><p>All of those weapons drew a circle around Tae Ho\u2019s left hand and poured towards Ares. They were strengthened by the sentence of the Milesian and obtained speed.</p><br/><p>A bombardment of weapons.</p><br/><p>The barrier of divinity Ares spread in a hurry blocked the first few attacks and the weapons Tae Ho made ended up getting destroyed.</p><br/><p>But it changed in the middle. Ares got pushed behind. There were weapons that pierced the warrior of divinity and stuck in Ares\u2019 body.</p><br/><p>Finally, the barrier collapsed. The last sword of light pierced Ares\u2019 chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ares stepped back. There was only pain in his voice, it didn\u2019t have valor or ambition in it.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho chased after him. He almost didn\u2019t have any strength left as he used the \u2018equipment of the dragon knight\u2019 in consecution but he still advanced forward.</p><br/><p>He grabbed the weapon he received when Odin conceded the seat of the master.</p><br/><p>Gungnir.</p><br/><p>Odin\u2019s spear.</p><br/><p>The spear of absolute accuracy that represented the master of Asgard.</p><br/><p>The weapon covered with a dark blue divinity pierced the chest of Ares.</p><br/><p>The golden divinity pushed away the flames that were covering the divinity of the God of war and the dark blue divinity became a sharp sword and destroyed the God of war!</p><br/><p>Ares screamed and that also got transmitted to his children that were still alive.</p><br/><p>Ares craved strength. He wanted to light the flames of his divinity even if he had to offer the lives of all his children.</p><br/><p>But Tae Ho didn\u2019t allow that. He made the God of war of Olympus submit as the master of Asgard and the God of conquer. His dark blue divinity devoured the divinity of the God of war that was trying to lit up again and destroyed it.</p><br/><p>The light in Ares\u2019 eyes disappeared.</p><br/><p>The connection between Ares and all his children was blocked. The ones that were despairing as they were getting their strength and lives taken lost consciousness.</p><br/><p>Ares looked at Tae Ho for the last time and Tae Ho sensed the existence looking at him through Ares.</p><br/><p>The owner of the voice.</p><br/><p>The one that had turned half of the 12 Olympians into beings wanting to destroy the world.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho glared at him and put back Gungnir. A crack appeared in Ares\u2019 body and then broke down completely. It became ash and got scattered away.</p><br/><p>[Synchro rate: 89%]</p><br/><p>Tae Ho closed his eyes and let out a sigh. He then turned around.</p><br/><p>He could see Adenmaha. She was smiling like a fool with a teary face. Her master Tae Ho realized why she was smiling like a fool and bit his lips to hold back the laughter that was about to come out.</p><br/><p>He called my name.</p><br/><p>He said Adenmaha and not Heda.</p><br/><p>Hehe, hehehe.</p><br/><p>She smiled modestly and sincerely enjoyed it.</p><br/><p>\u2018Blessed bastard.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn said and Tae Ho agreed to his words. He didn\u2019t only turn to look at Adenmaha but at everyone and claimed as the master of Asgard. You could say that his yell was a declaration of war to the one that infringed upon Olympus.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Asgard and the nine realms.\u201d</p><br/><p>Asgard won\u2019t abandon Olympus.</p><br/><p>He would protect Asgard and the nine realms.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Asgard and the nine realms.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bracky and Siri hit their chest from a distance. Odin held the same words in his mouth from Asgard even though the connection had been severed long ago. Freya looked at Odin as if he had turned crazy but she also followed Odin and hit her chest.</p><br/><p>The destruction of the God of war Ares.</p><br/><p>The liberation of all the ones that were under the control of Ares.</p><br/><p>It was the beginning of a great counter attack.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 54 \u2013 Hall of Valhalla (2) &gt; End</p><hr/><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/>\n</div>"}

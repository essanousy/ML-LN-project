Heda!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRagnar\u201d</p><br/><p>They were more glad to see Ragnar rather than the sense of incongruity towards Tae Ho that Heda smiled brightly and answered to his call.</p><br/><p>Ragnar was running towards them with a frowning face. It seemed like it was even hard to run like normal.</p><br/><p>\u201cPant\u2026pant\u2026I\u2019m too\u2026.decayed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar barely managed to reach them and cursed out. It was because Tae Ho was lying on Heda\u2019s lap.</p><br/><p>However his eyes were laughing compared to his eyes. He clearly showed that he was happy that Tae Ho was alive.</p><br/><p>Babang!</p><br/><p>Right then, thunder fell down. Heda and Ragnar turned their eyes hurriedly and Tae Ho also turned his head with difficulty.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was the case? The policy of immediate destruction Odin laid down.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar said in a low voice. The sound that was heard seemed to be made by destroying Garmr\u2019s soul fragment.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeda, Thor is coming.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar added in a low voice and fixed his posture. Heda pressed Tae Ho\u2019s shoulders slightly as if it wasn\u2019t necessary to stand up and looked at Thor that was coming to them.</p><br/><p>Thor flew with his red cape fluttering and then landed a bit far away from them and started to walk towards them. He was certainly being considerate about the dust flying because of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s really delicate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda smirked and mumbled in a low voice. Thinking about it, Heda had said something similar the first time they met.</p><br/><p>\u2018He has a lot of affection and is a considerate man.\u2019</p><br/><p>And then Thor finally entered Tae Ho\u2019s eyes. He was a handsome beauty that had perfect muscles to the point you could call him a moving sculpture.</p><br/><p>He who had gold hair and beard was wearing silver and black armor and leather pants, but his arms that were like steel were showing up so it took your attention away.</p><br/><p>\u2018So that is Mjolnir.\u2019</p><br/><p>A throwing hammer that had a short handle.</p><br/><p>The way it looked was really simple. It seemed like it was a rectangle with a handle in it.</p><br/><p>However Tae Ho stopped breathing the moment he activated the \u2018eyes of the dragon\u2019. Thor and Mjolnir were both amazing. Mjolnir\u2019s letters were obviously rainbow colored but it was emitting a strong light perhaps for having shown its strength recently.</p><br/><p>And Thor was more than that. He could see his name and the green color because he clearly knew that he was an ally but that was all.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, it\u2019s obvious.\u2019</p><br/><p>Because Thor wasn\u2019t a normal God. He was the God of Thunder that stood on the peak along with Odin and was the bes fighter.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeda.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThor-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Thor greeted her with a smile Heda slightly bowed and greeted back. Looking at Thor\u2019s expression, it seemed like they were quite friendly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m greeting Thor-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRagnar Lodbrok. It\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar hit his chest twice as if expressing his manners to Thor, that greeted in joy. And then Thor also hit his chest while laughing.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, is this Idun\u2019s warrior that\u2019s rumored that you treasure him?\u201d</p><br/><p>When they finished the greetings, Thor looked at Tae Ho lying down in Heda\u2019s lap and asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018What should I say.\u2019</p><br/><p>Did he have to stand up now? But it was hard. Honestly speaking, he had barely managed to call Heda before.</p><br/><p>Perhaps Heda had felt Tae Ho\u2019s conflict that she pressed down his shoulder once again and then nodded with a flushed face.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are still cute.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thor laughed and looked at Tae Ho again.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun\u2019s warrior, I heard that Ragnar is teaching you. This is a really rare case. I\u2019m waiting for the day we stand on the same battlefield.\u201d</p><br/><p>His smiling face was really friendly.</p><br/><p>As Tae Ho expressed his thanks with his eyes, it seemed like Thor had understood that he made a light gesture with his hand and let him rest. Then he looked at Ragnar and Heda and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to have a deeper conversation with you but I know there are more warriors that need help. Also, I will have to report what happened to father the fastest I can. It\u2019s unfortunate but we will leave it to another opportunity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for assisting us.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Ragnar expressed his manners again, Thor shook his hand as if that wasn\u2019t the case.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was an obvious thing. I\u2019m the one that should be thankful to you and Idun\u2019s warrior. Thank you for protecting my warriors from the giant of strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thor moved his eyes to look at Bracky and the warriors of Thor\u2019s legion and grabbed Mjolnir tightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeda.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda blinked her eyes as if she was surprised that she was called and then pulled herself a bit backwards and exposed Tae Ho. And then Thor lowered his posture next to Tae Ho and hit Tae Ho\u2019s shoulders lightly with Mjolnir.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun\u2019s warrior, my blessing shall accompany you.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was Thor\u2019s blessing. A spark and small blue thunder appeared in Tae Ho\u2019s shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u2018How glad.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho thought of Cu Chulainn\u2019s blessing and got relieved and Thor seemed to have read that expression as thanks and laughed again.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, let\u2019s meet in another occasion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thor finished saying his farewell and then walked a few steps and flew up. He raised Mjolnir and yelled.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy warriors! Let\u2019s meet in the residence again! For Asgard and the nine planets!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThor!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThor!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Asgard and the nine planets!\u201d</p><br/><p>The warriors of Thor\u2019s legion raised their weapons and cheered. Thor swung Mjolnir for those warriors and then turned his body and flew away. The sound of thunder getting farther away was really pleasing.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still the same.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar, that was looking at Thor like a mountain getting farther away, smiled bitterly and said. Heda also smiled and then looked down at Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow rest. Sleep well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he had regained consciousness, he was too tired. In addition it seemed like it was thanks to Heda, but it was really comfortable and warm even though he was lying on the ground.</p><br/><p>But Tae Ho grabbed his consciousness fading away forcefully. He still had something he had to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cGae\u2026\u2026Bolg.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar hurriedly understood his meaning as he mumbled in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will take it. I will be able to discern it even without your eyes of the dragon as it had emitted a strength like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda couldn\u2019t see how Tae Ho used Gae Bolg.</p><br/><p>Heda opened her eyes widely at Ragnar\u2019s answer but didn\u2019t ask any questions. She caressed Tae Ho\u2019s head as if telling him to sleep.</p><br/><p>\u201cSleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar also spoke and then Tae Ho closed his eyes. He thought about Rolo briefly but he really was at his limit.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s sleep.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho loosened his body.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>Tae Ho had received a full body anesthesia once.</p><br/><p>A surprising experience that he received the drug, lost consciousness and when he woke up several hours had passed.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s the same.\u2019</p><br/><p>He slept really deeply to the point he didn\u2019t even dream.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho opened his eyes slowly and then put on a smile unconsciously. It was because he saw Heda falling asleep while sitting on the bedside.</p><br/><p>This scene made him happy just by watching that Tae Ho just stayed down. And after some seconds Heda raised her head perhaps for having felt something.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda wiped the saliva from her mouth as if she wasn\u2019t fully awake and she stuttered for a moment and got aware of Tae Ho\u2019s gaze.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf, if you woke up you should have told me. Really.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed like she was quite embarrassed that her stuttering was really cute.</p><br/><p>\u201cI should have.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho answered shamelessly and Heda flushed even more. It was really nice to see this scene but compared to before, there was a voice cutting in.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo it in moderation. We are also here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar\u2019s voice was heard from behind Heda. Followed by that Siri\u2019s voice was also heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho, drink some water.\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri approached while laughing and gave Tae Ho a glass of water. Tae Ho got up without much difficulty for having slept deeply and then looked at his surroundings and received the glass.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you Siri.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed like they were at a hunter\u2019s hut or something of the sort. The group was gathered in a small wooden house that didn\u2019t have any separations.The fire burning in the stove made the air warm.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that it was a really big battle. I\u2019m glad that\u2026..you aren\u2019t safe, bug i\u2019m glad that you are alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri retrieved the empty glass and smiled bitterly. And Tae Ho could also smile back.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou too Siri.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because she had also been on the battlefield.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, I feel like being alive.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho closed his eyes and let out a sigh of relief. After drinking cold water he felt like his head had become more clear.</p><br/><p>\u201cRagnar, what about Gae Bolg?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI brought it.\u201d</p><br/><p>After he asked the most urgent thing, he lightly shook Gae Bolg\u2019s fragment. Even when he looked with his eyes of the dragon, there seemed to be nothing wrong.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhew.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was glad. He was worried about losing it because the ground was a mess after all those earthquakes, but it really was Ragnar.</p><br/><p>Ragnar placed down Gae Bolg\u2019s fragment in the table next to Tae Ho with a sound and then started to speak about other things.</p><br/><p>\u201cGarm\u2019s soul fragment was destroyed by Thor. The members of his legion returned back and the giant got taken care by Thor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about Rolo?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRolo?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe gryphon we caught.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou already gave it a name?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar laughed as if it made no sense and Tae Ho quickly shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, um\u2026.it already had a name when I looked with the \u2018eyes of the dragon.\u201d</p><br/><p>The wyverns he had rode on the battlefield didn\u2019t have any names. Already having a name proved that Rolo was special.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways, the gryphon is sleeping outside. It\u2019s really exhausted but it isn\u2019t that hurt.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>They had gone to that place to catch Rolo but if it died it would have been for nothing.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho and Ragnar shared the same thought and smirked while looking at each other. This time Heda was the one that shook her head and then she grabbed Tae Ho\u2019s hands and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho, what about resting a bit more?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Look at me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s obvious because you ate a piece of a golden apple.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar said once again with a taciturn voice. He had his doubts, but he had really eaten the piece.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you Heda.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Ye yeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a normal thanks, but Heda flushed as if she was embarrassed. And she even dodged Tae Ho\u2019s eyes for some reason.</p><br/><p>\u2018So the maybe became a really!\u2019</p><br/><p>The way she fed him the piece.</p><br/><p>However he couldn\u2019t remember clearly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways, let us ask something as you are fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar, that was sitting down, fixed his posture. And his eyes and his voice weren\u2019t joking like before.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened since you were out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda looked at Tae Ho. Because she was the first to felt a sense of incongruity.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho touched his forehead before answering. He felt another force than Heda\u2019s blessing.</p><br/><p>Ragnar didn\u2019t urge Tae Ho. Heda also waited for Tae Ho while grabbing his hands.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho gulped dry saliva and looked at Ragnar\u2019s and Heda\u2019s eyes and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cI met\u2026.the prince of light, Cu Chulainn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cErin\u2019s successor\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragar said in a low voice after listening to Tae Ho. His voice was mixed with wonder and lamentation.</p><br/><p>In the other hand Heda blinked with a really surprised face and then asked after approaching Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? Cu Chulainn really told you that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, he also said that he would become my teacher.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was all true. In the first place he didn\u2019t have a reason to lie to Heda and Ragnar.</p><br/><p>\u201cRagnar.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda turned to look at Ragnar. It seemed like she was asking what they should do.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that was why.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar nodded slowly instead of answering and turned to look at Siri.</p><br/><p>\u201cSiri, what we spoke up to now is a secret belonging to Idun\u2019s legion. Can you keep it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Ragnar-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri nodded with a stiff expression. It wasn\u2019t that she would betray Ullr\u2019s legion only for Ragnar. Each legion had secrets that couldn\u2019t be revealed to other legions. Keeping it should be something obvious for a warrior.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar caressed Siri\u2019s head once and then looked at Tae Ho again.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will first say the most urgent thing. It seems like you are aware of it but Cu Chulainn left you a power.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are talking about\u2026..the Geass right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, it\u2019s Erin\u2019s force that\u2019s comparable to the saga of our Valhalla.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar spoke to that point and then paused. He smacked his lips as if wondering what he should say and then continued speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho, do you remember my explanation about Geasses?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said that it\u2019s a method that gives you strength instead of a restriction.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just like you said. What Cu Chulainn left you is a sentence of a Geass. It\u2019s like an empty contract to make a new geass.\u201d</p><br/><p>The saga was the life of a warrior. Because of that every warrior had different sagas.</p><br/><p>And it was the same for the geass. Because it was like a warrior\u2019s pledge. It wasn\u2019t something others could decide for you.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will tell you as your teacher. Seal the geass for the moment. It\u2019s not something that should be used too hurriedly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI spoke about many things with Ragnar while you were asleep. I also think that it\u2019s still too early.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda stepped up. Ragnar looked at Tae Ho\u2019s eyes fixedly and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe geass gives you a greater strength the stronger the restriction is. Because of that you can become strong quickly if you use a strong geass. But it\u2019s too dangerous. Just like it\u2019s a strong restriction, it\u2019s also hard to keep it. In addition, the counter reaction that happens when you don\u2019t keep a strong geass is also big. I know a few warriors of Erin that had perished because of the geass.\u201d</p><br/><p>You could become strong quickly but it was that much dangerous.</p><br/><p>Compared to that, the saga that was something you had to keep accumulating anecdotes was close to being progressive. Although your growth may be slow, the base it gave you was solid and the danger was also low.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, it\u2019s true that the geass is a useful power. If you use it in a suitable level without being too greedy it will be of great help to you. But just like I said at the start, it\u2019s too early for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho was a warrior of Valhalla. In addition he had an unparalleled saga that was never heard of. It was true for him to prioritize the saga instead of the geass.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, grow your strength as a warrior of Valhalla in your saga and the power of a God. Rather than using the geass now, using it at a later time will be more effective. Do you understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho also understood what he was saying that he simply nodded. And then, Ragnar turned to look at Siri.</p><br/><p>\u201cSiri should be fine because she\u2019s an exemplary student.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><br/><p>As she asked back unconsciously, Ragnar softly caressed her hair and then asked Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, what do you think about seeing a myth ranked saga?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really seemed like mythology.\u201d</p><br/><p>A saga that was added the power of a God.</p><br/><p>The power that reached the boundary of mythology after having passed the normal legends.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, but it\u2019s a boundary you should reach one day. You have to surpass it. Because it\u2019s the power of a superior ranked warrior.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe power of a top ranked warrior is obviously a secret. Skipping the grades two times is enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar shook his head bluntly and then smiled again.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that it turned like this, I will train you with the myth ranked saga as the objective. Use the geass after you have reached the myth ranked saga\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>The myth ranked saga was the power of a superior ranked warrior. Although he would soon become intermediate ranked, it was a power the inferior ranked Tae Ho couldn\u2019t see lightly.</p><br/><p>But not even Tae Ho or Ragnar thought like that.</p><br/><p>Because he would surely reach it in no time.</p><br/><p>\u201cExplain it to Siri too. We will talk about Gae Bolg and Cu Chulainn when we return to the residence.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even if that wasn\u2019t the case, Siri that was curious as to what they were talking about, flinched. Ragnar patted her head once again and stood up.</p><br/><p>\u201cRagnar?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will take some air for a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar gestured with his hand to Heda and thought while getting out of the hut.</p><br/><p>\u2018Amazing.\u2019</p><br/><p>Although he had spoken calmly, each and every word was impressive.</p><br/><p>The Geass, that was the power of Erin.</p><br/><p>Cu Chulainn that was the strongest warrior of Erin.</p><br/><p>Scathach was alive. The weapon of the destroyed planet was waiting to be revived in Tae Ho\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>In addition what Cu Chulainn had said with his own mouth.</p><br/><p>Erin\u2019s successor.</p><br/><p>The one that will inherit the power of the Milesians and Tuatha De Danann.</p><br/><p>And one more weapon that hadn\u2019t revealed its identity.</p><br/><p>\u2018I will go crazy.\u2019</p><br/><p>Just thinking about the myth rank saga that Tae Ho would reach some day made him excited.</p><br/><p>It would be good to call Tae Ho\u2019s saga as already being mythology itself. Then what would happen if that saga turned to become mythology ranked?</p><br/><p>And if Erin\u2019s power was added on top of that.</p><br/><p>It was night outside the hut. The cold night air was good to clear your head.</p><br/><p>\u2018What do you think will be the best?\u2019</p><br/><p>The words Heda had asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Perhaps I may have to upgrade the adjustments a bit.\u2019</p><br/><p>A smile appeared in Ragnar\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>\u201cThe myth ranked saga of Ragnar-nim\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri said in a low voice while breathing roughly. Her cheeks were flushed and her eyes were looking at a distant place.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026..for his name itself to be a saga\u2026..How cool.\u201d</p><br/><p>She was completely dreaming- no, she was a girl that had fallen in love.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho looked at Siri smiling merrily and asked Heda in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe is captain Siri, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat seems to be the case.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda laughed soundlessly. It was funny to look at Siri\u2019s transformation.</p><br/><p>\u201cCheer up Rolph.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because Siri\u2019s feelings towards Ragnar should only be admiration. That would probably be the case.</p><br/><p>\u2018Right, probably.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRolph?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, there\u2019s someone. My comrade that belongs to Ullr\u2019s legion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho explained about Rolph in moderation and then checked on Siri and looked at the sky. It was because he remembered something after thinking of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that I see, Heda. What are our plans for tomorrow?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOriginally we were planning to stay here for a few more days and train, but we will return to the residence immediately. Although you look well because of the golden apple, you still need stabilization and rest. You are forbidden to train and everything for a moment. Looking for Gae Bolg also comes after you rest. You just have to rest for a few days, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Her last sentence and eyes were quite firm. However Tae Ho grabbed her hands instead of answering and said something else.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen Heda, what about sightseeing with me now that we are resting?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo Anaheim.\u201d</p><br/><p>The place Siri had said to go with Rolph.</p><br/><p>If he would be resting anyways, it would be better to rest earnestly.</p><br/><p>Heda blinked with a surprised face at Tae Ho\u2019s request.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you that excited?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI, i\u2019m not. I\u2019m not excited at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 18 \u2013 Anaheim (1) &gt; End</p><br/>\n</div>"}

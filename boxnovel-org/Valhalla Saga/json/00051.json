However, he could see several things at the same time.</p><br/><p>One of the five commanders of the magician King, Utgard Loki.</p><br/><p>That name wasn\u2019t low at all. It was a place a normal giant couldn\u2019t climb to at all.</p><br/><p>Because of that, Avalt recognized his allies. Although each of them had their own defects, they were strong enough, even when taking those into account.</p><br/><p>The Giant of Strength, Harad, disliked Avalt. And it was the same for Avalt. However, just like it was said previously, they recognized each other and they had a comradeship, even though it was weak.</p><br/><p>Because of that, he was feeling regret.</p><br/><p>\u2018We were too rash.\u2019</p><br/><p>He knew what had caused that one big mistake. And the Magician king was not responding to it. It would be that he didn\u2019t tolerate two mistakes. He would have wanted to make some achievements, even when forcing it. Even though it was a compliment or a scolding, he must want the attention of the magician King.</p><br/><p>The Giant of Strength, Harad, was strong. If an existence like him moved, Asgard wouldn\u2019t stay still. His existence could be felt from a distant place.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo hurry up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finish it quickly. Retrieve the fragment of soul and return.</p><br/><p>The Giant of Night, Avalt, spread the darkness. It hid the existence of the Giant of Strength when he descended to Asgard, even though it was by a small amount.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>Heda climbed to the chest of a giant and then looked at her surroundings.</p><br/><p>They had won the battle. She could arrive on time and defeat a giant, and the warriors of Valhalla defeated the monsters.</p><br/><p>Siri had also performed well. After she had a short conversation with an inferior-ranked warrior of Thor\u2019s legion, she started to approach Heda.</p><br/><p>She already knew the general situation. It was because she had overheard the conversation Siri and the inferior-ranked warrior had. The sensitive ears of a Valkyrie could differentiate several sounds ringing in the battlefield at the same time, one by one.</p><br/><p>And the place Tae Ho went to would also be fine. Based on the words of the inferior-ranked warrior, the best forces had been gathered there. In addition, Ragnar was with them. Although he had retired because of a fatal injury, he was still someone that had once climbed to the top rank. He would be able to crush down ordinary danger.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why she was able to do it. She pressed down her anxiousness and it wouldn\u2019t be too late if she flew again along with Siri and the warriors.</p><br/><p>But it was at that moment that Heda raised her head and knew. That was why she was shocked..</p><br/><p>How?</p><br/><p>How did an existence of that caliber-?</p><br/><p>Siri became flustered at Heda\u2019s sudden change but then she wore the same expression. It was because she could also feel it. Even if one wasn\u2019t a Valkyrie that Gods were dependent on, the uneasy aura could still be felt.. It felt like that strength was enough to cover the entire plains.</p><br/><p>The warriors of Thor\u2019s legion turned to look at the same direction at the same time. They could also feel it now. Even if one was dull enough, they couldn\u2019t not know about it.</p><br/><p>A storm was approaching. It could only be expressed that way..</p><br/><p>\u201cTae Ho!\u201d</p><br/><p>Heda, who yelled like thunder, couldn\u2019t endure it anymore. She jumped up and transformed into a swan. Even before Siri could yell something towards her she had already flown up high.</p><br/><p>Please, please, please!</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t let Tae Ho be at that place. Let him be at a distant place just like Siri and the others!</p><br/><p>Heda\u2019s wings started to move faster, and golden light started to shine on the tips.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>That had been a really sudden change.</p><br/><p>The sky had been dyed in black, as if an eclipse had occurred.</p><br/><p>The ground shook. The ground which was already devastated started to scream.</p><br/><p>He could see it but he couldn\u2019t react. It seemed as if time had stopped.</p><br/><p>A black meteorite fell to the ground. It was just like looking at a star falling down.</p><br/><p>There was no sound. Nor an explosion.</p><br/><p>It just existed there on the ground.</p><br/><p>Giant.</p><br/><p>The one that looked down at everything and the ones that were as proud as the sky.</p><br/><p>It was a black and red giant.</p><br/><p>It was really tall. It seemed to be the same size as the giant that had appeared in Black Fortress.</p><br/><p>However, they weren\u2019t the same.</p><br/><p>Different from the lowest-ranked giant, which seemed to have been made by gathering rocks, it couldn\u2019t be compared to the complete giant in front of them. It was a workpiece made to have a shape that could exert the most strength, and the most battling one.</p><br/><p>Its shoulders were broad and its arms were hard. The muscles that showed from beneath the black and red armor resembled metal.</p><br/><p>His eyes were burning from between the helmet, which had no decorations or symbol.</p><br/><p>The Giant of Strength, Harad. One of the fingers of the magician King.</p><br/><p>Thor\u2019s legion, that was running to that side, stopped in their tracks. They couldn\u2019t charge forward anymore. They could only stare, as if they were looking at a fierce storm.</p><br/><p>And that was lucky for them.</p><br/><p>Because they couldn\u2019t reach the battlefield. Because they could distance themselves a bit more from the giant.</p><br/><p>The giant swung his arm. It was a light movement. However, the ground and the sky shook with just that. What exactly it did couldn\u2019t be grasped, but the result was in front of them.</p><br/><p>Tanngnjostr disappeared.</p><br/><p>Precisely speaking, it broke into pieces and was scattered. The warriors riding it disappeared along with it without even being able to scream.</p><br/><p>Bracky couldn\u2019t breathe. He couldn\u2019t even feel that he was out of breath.</p><br/><p>Just what had happened?</p><br/><p>What was the existence in front of their eyes?</p><br/><p>The giant looked at Bracky and swung his arms again. Bracky couldn\u2019t move. It was the same for Rolo and Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>The battlefield had stopped excluding the giant.</p><br/><p>Bracky was fated to disappear just like the Tanngnjostr.</p><br/><p>If only he wasn\u2019t in this place.</p><br/><p>There was no sound.</p><br/><p>However, the ground split up. The strength of the arm that was swung by the giant got offset and was dispersed.</p><br/><p>When everyone had stopped, he moved. He stood in front of Bracky and swung his sword.</p><br/><p>The crack had been made like that.</p><br/><p>Bracky could finally breathe. Rolo, which was falling from the sky without strength, also got a hold of itself and started to flutter its wings. Tae Ho also breathed roughly and looked at the one that stood up against the giant.</p><br/><p>\u201cRagnar Lodbrok.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Giant of Strength, Harad, spoke. Ragnar smiled faintly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are crazy. For you to come here yourself!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have fallen down.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Giant of Strength recognized Ragnar. It was impossible to not recognize the top-ranked warrior that had battled in the Great War and there was also his legend in his times as a Viking.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why he couldn\u2019t act, even though time was precious right now. He put on a smile that had joy and compassion behind it.</p><br/><p>Ragnar Lodbrok had fallen. He was too weak. In addition, Tae Ho and Bracky didn\u2019t know, but Harad did.</p><br/><p>Ragnar was now at his limit. Even though he had merely faced inferior giants, he was already exhausted.</p><br/><p>He did have the strength, but he couldn\u2019t display it properly.</p><br/><p>That was the reason why Ragnar could only retire.</p><br/><p>\u2018There\u2019s no time.\u2019</p><br/><p>Ragnar and Harad thought the same thing.</p><br/><p>However, the meaning was different.</p><br/><p>Harad needed to hurry. And Ragnar had to extend this confrontation for as long as possible.</p><br/><p>The two exchanged glances. Ragnar and Harad laughed together and moved at the same time.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Harad\u2019s fist hit down the hog, and he hog was extinguished at his attack. Its leather and muscles burnt down and Garm\u2019s soul fragment also disappeared, as if it had evaporated. The fragment that was stuck on its head rolled on the ground.</p><br/><p>Ragnar swung his sword. Although he was at a distance that wouldn\u2019t reach the giant, it did. The force which could only be expressed as a sword slash, aimed for the arm of the giant and prevented him from picking up the fragment.</p><br/><p>\u201cRun.\u201d Ragnar smiled bitterly and said. Harad swung his fist once again as Bracky couldn\u2019t react.</p><br/><p>The ground exploded. The monsters near it got swept up with just the wind generated.</p><br/><p>Ragnar picked up Bracky, who was standing dumbfoundedly instead of resisting and started to run. He entrusted his body to the wind.</p><br/><p>And the giant started to chase Ragnar. The chasing speed coming from its huge body was amazing.</p><br/><p>\u201cRagnar Lodbrok!\u201d</p><br/><p>He had fallen. He had already retired. But his head still had value. The legendary head of the Viking King could become the best offering to the magician King.</p><br/><p>Harad\u2019s fist hit the air again. Bracky got ahold of himself at the feeling that a huge hail was approaching.</p><br/><p>Actually, Ragnar wasn\u2019t that different. However, he rolled his body instead of breaking down at the hail. He tried to create some distance while riding in the wind.</p><br/><p>Ragnar surged high into the sky. Harad glared at the sky, and the monsters that were unable to breathe properly fell to the ground. And Rolo fluttered its wings while it began to lose consciousness.</p><br/><p>\u201cRagnar!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was Tae Ho. He controlled Rolo with the \u2018One That Handles Dragons\u2019. He made Rolo fly up forcefully and tried to grab Ragnar.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho extended his hand. Ragnar looked at his hand and then looked at Tae Ho\u2019s face. He was smirking, even though it was a serious situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really are extraordinary.\u201d</p><br/><p>At the very least, Sigurd.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t someone that should die in this place. He couldn\u2019t die.</p><br/><p>\u201cFlee.\u201d Ragnar spoke again. He threw Bracky instead of grabbing his hand. Tae Ho stumbled while grabbing Bracky reflexively and then hit his chest lightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cRagnar!\u201d Tae Ho yelled again. Ragnar smiled and turned back. He threw himself towards Harad, just like Tae Ho could do.</p><br/><p>He would save Tae Ho and Bracky.</p><br/><p>He would also stop the giant from taking the fragment of a soul.</p><br/><p>And he would buy as much time as he could.</p><br/><p>Harad swung his fist once again towards Ragnar. It was different from the ones until now.</p><br/><p>There was a strong force behind the wind. This time it could really be said that the hail could destroy everything.</p><br/><p>Ragnar breathed out. He swung his sword, trying to find an opening in the hail. And then he passed through it like a lie and landed on the ground as if he was dancing.</p><br/><p>How much could he endure? How many more breaths did he have?</p><br/><p>Harad used a greater strength. His underlings started to descend from the sky.</p><br/><p>Just what the hell was happening when he had just come to catch a gryphon?</p><br/><p>Ragnar opened his lips and then whispered while storing the strength of magic. He told Tae Ho, who didn\u2019t flee even though he was told to do so.</p><br/><p>It was the first thing Tae Ho asked when they first started with the classes.</p><br/><p>If the intermediate rank is the stage where you handle the Strength of a God, what did you do at the superior and top rank?</p><br/><p>It was still too early.</p><br/><p>Even more than he thought.</p><br/><p>But the situation was special. It wasn\u2019t the time to be saving it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will teach you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The strength of a superior-ranked warrior.</p><br/><p>The new boundary he would have to face then.</p><br/><p>Harad\u2019s strength had become the best. The fire that was covering his entire body made him look like a God of Fire.</p><br/><p>And Ragnar raised his sword against Harad. He used the white Strength of a God, the strength of the King of Gods, Odin.</p><br/><p>\u2018The inferior rank is the process to reach the intermediate rank.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was also the same for the intermediate rank. It was all to reach the superior rank.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t only stop in inserting the Strength of a God in your weapon. It even surpassed the level of holding it in your body.</p><br/><p>The origin of the strength of the warriors of Valhalla was their saga.</p><br/><p>They added the Strength of a God to their stories.</p><br/><p>Led their sagas to a higher place.</p><br/><p>\u2018Passing through the anecdotes.\u2019</p><br/><p>Surpassing the legend to finally reach the myth.</p><br/><p>[Mythology Ranked Saga]</p><br/><p>[King of Vikings: Ragnar Lodbrok]</p><br/><p>On top of the destroyed land, on the traces of the Great War, another myth began.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 16 \u2013 Legend (3) &gt; End</p><hr/><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/><p>Episode 16/Chapter 4: Legend (4)</p><br/><p>TL: Tsubak</p><br/><p>ED:</p><hr/><br/><p>He was an exalted king.</p><br/><p>He was a brave navigator that had sailed to seas no one had ever dared to,</p><br/><p>and had never been defeated once until Odin called him.</p><br/><p>People remembered him.</p><br/><p>And those people transmitted his name to the generation to come.</p><br/><p>The start of the vikings.</p><br/><p>The king of all vikings.</p><br/><p>He carried a big and round shield in his back. And held the viking sword Ulfberht with a hand.</p><br/><p>The blue and red pigments painting his face made him look more flashy.</p><br/><p>Ragnar took a deep breath. The cold air reaching his lungs made his head clear.</p><br/><p>His eyes resembling a wolf that held mysteriousness and madness flashed. A face was drawn in his face.</p><br/><p>He the one that was an explorer, plunderer, warrior, king, navigator, farmer and a strategist.</p><br/><p>The image people believed in, imagined and remembered became one and created the first and most powerful viking. The current Ragnar was an existence like that.</p><br/><p>It has been a really long while. Nearly a hundred years. It was the first time after the Great War.</p><br/><p>The giant of strength Harad shivered and then smiled. Although he had come to this battlefield as if being chased with anxiousness, he was still a warrior. Now that he was facing a Great warrior, he had also become a Great warrior.</p><br/><p>Red and black fire surged up from Harad\u2019s body. The him that was behind his fist was difficult to imagine.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamned.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar cursed like a joke. It seemed like he looked at another place for a moment and then charged forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cRagnar!\u201d</p><br/><p>Harad laughed freshly and punched. Ragnar also swung his sword.</p><br/><p>And at that moment Tae Ho could know why this battle had reached the boundary of mythology.</p><br/><p>Kwagagagagang~!</p><br/><p>An earthquake shook. The ground split tens and hundreds of times with the epicenter at the center. The monsters that were near it got swept up and got shredded. This wasn\u2019t a fight between individuals anymore. They would have to rewrite the map because of this one attack.</p><br/><p>The aftershock of the attack also affected the air. Rolo, that had lost consciousness for a moment, let out a cry but then regained consciousness. It got pushed back because of the rash wind.</p><br/><p>Ragnar cursed while being inside the big dust cloud that arose. The clash just now wasn\u2019t simply an exchange of a fist and a sword. It was a competition of complicated and mysterious techniques that had the essences of the both of them melted in it.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>A loud sound exploded in consecution. The fist of the giant of strength were able to shake the ground and sky. Just looking at strength, he was the best among the five fingers of the magician king.</p><br/><p>Ragnar was small and he was big. However this wasn\u2019t a problem anymore. Harad\u2019s fists were precise and Ragnar dodged Harad\u2019s attacks with his senses that were as sharp as a sword. He fended off his fists with the viking sword and at the same time threw the axe he had taken out.</p><br/><p>It was small but strong. Not even Harad could see the meteor like attack easily. The axe that had grazed Harad\u2019s waist split the ground with a white light. Smoke surged up from Harad\u2019s waist instead of blood.</p><br/><p>Merely 10 seconds. However after the battle that was enough to kill thousands of people Ragnar let out a curse. He had already reached his limit. He didn\u2019t even have the strength to use the small stories inside the big ones.</p><br/><p>It was really awful. He just had to stall for time but he couldn\u2019t even do that. The only way was to win with one attack.</p><br/><p>\u2018One sword.\u2019</p><br/><p>Ragnar distanced himself from Harad. It was a really short interval but it was enough with that. Ragnar prepared the best attack he could execute now.</p><br/><p>But Harad also felt that. It was a terrifying thing. Even though he had fallen he was still the viking king. Even though the attack Ragnar was preparing wasn\u2019t executed, it still made Harad really nervous.</p><br/><p>Because of that Harad moved faster. He remembered the fact that Ragnar wasn\u2019t a simple warrior but a king and then attacked.</p><br/><p>What he fired was red and black fireballs. And the strong wind that was like a hail was added onto that.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t towards Ragnar.</p><br/><p>Thor\u2019s legion.</p><br/><p>The small existences that were overwhelmed at the mythical scene that was occurring in front of them and at Harad\u2019s appearance.</p><br/><p>It was also a gamble for Harad.</p><br/><p>If Ragnar ignored his attack, he wouldn\u2019t be able to dodge a fatal wound because his defenses were low for having executed the earlier attack.</p><br/><p>Ragnar moved and Harad smiled.</p><br/><p>The black fireballs got cut off. The hail like wind got split in two and scattered.</p><br/><p>The warriors of Thor\u2019s legion realized instinctively that death had just passed in front of their eyes. Ragnar was standing in front of them while holding the viking sword Ulfberht.</p><br/><p>Ragnar couldn\u2019t ignore them. Because he was the Viking king. He was someone that led warriors.</p><br/><p>Ragnar closed his eyes and forced a laugh. His strength left his body. His mythical ranked saga was leaving his body.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn it.\u2019</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t beat Harad. Although he had spent quite a lot of strength, that was all.</p><br/><p>If he had chosen to attack instead of defending.</p><br/><p>Ragnar threw away his regrets. He saw Harad that was rushing at him. He looked at him extending his fist while laughing and said as if lamenting.</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you to flee.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ragnar\u2019s eyes moved to the sky. At that moment Harad could know.</p><br/><p>Harad\u2019s eyes moved upwards. It was also to the sky. He saw the thing that was falling down towards him from the sky.</p><br/><p>Harad swung his hands. The black fire became raging billows and covered the sky. However the arrow coming from the sky didn\u2019t stop.</p><br/><p>\u201cHu! Ah! Hu! Ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bracky breathed out weirdly. It was a method he had come up to not get buried by the myth in front of his eyes.</p><br/><p>The raging billow covered them. Just a normal billow was terrifying enough, but this one was made of fire. But they couldn\u2019t dodge it. They had to overcome it just like they did so for a storm.</p><br/><p>[Saga: He\u2019s the son of a God]</p><br/><p>[Saga: Thunder gets immersed in his hammer]</p><br/><p>Bracky jumped down from Rolo. He charged into the raging billow and swung his hammer that had thunder in it.</p><br/><p>The thunder opened a path. Although it merely split it for a moment, it was enough with that.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bracky fell and yelled. Rolo passed through the path of flames along with Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>[Saga: Charge of the dragon]</p><br/><p>Harad stopped his charge and stepped on the ground. And then he extended his fist.</p><br/><p>It was an attack that could split the sky in two. It was impossible to face him head on.</p><br/><p>\u2018Just like I expected!\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho jumped down from Rolo. Rolo drew a sharp trajectory like planned and moved to Ragnar and Tae Ho twisted his body in the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cChant!\u201d</p><br/><p>He fluttered his wings after having transformed into a hawk. He passed over Harad\u2019s fist that was covered in flames and that made him think that he was riding on a wall.</p><br/><p>It was hot. No, he felt like dying. He felt like Tae Ho\u2019s existence was getting crushed just by being close to him.</p><br/><p>But he had to endure it. He activated the strength of a God. Idun\u2019s power covered Tae Ho\u2019s body. Heda\u2019s blessing that remained in his forehead protected him.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho fluttered his wings again and flew. Rolo was being controlled by Ragnar. Bracky fell to the ground after having become a mess and then Tae Ho realized.</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t escape.</p><br/><p>Dodging Harad was impossible now. Harad had already pulled his fist back. Even if he flew up like this, he would only get crushed by his fist.</p><br/><p>\u2018Heda.\u2019</p><br/><p>He got some strength just by thinking of that name. Tae Ho cursed himself saying that he was crazy and charged forward. Whether he became porridge or rice, he could only attack now.</p><br/><p>\u201cChant!\u201d</p><br/><p>He yelled and transformed to a human again. He could feel Harad\u2019s eyes chasing him back. Tae Ho ground his teeth and activated the strength of his saga.</p><br/><p>[Saga: Immortal warrior]</p><br/><p>[Saga: The charge of a warrior is like a storm]</p><br/><p>He gripped the Sword piece. He tried to kick the air while being followed by a thunderstorm.</p><br/><p>Right then.</p><br/><p>When he was about to yell Heda\u2019s name for the last time.</p><br/><p>\u2018I will help you.\u2019</p><br/><p>Gae Bolg\u2019s piece, that was in his waist, moved. It entered Tae Ho\u2019s hand by its own.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t the time to understand it with his head. Tae Ho grabbed the piece of Gae Bolg tightly. At that moment, white light started to be emanated from the piece.</p><br/><p>Shining spear.</p><br/><p>The incomplete thing was certainly Gae Bolg.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho could feel Cu Chulainn. Perhaps it may only be playing his memories again. However he could know. What he had to do and how he should use Gae Bolg!</p><br/><p>He kicked the air. He threw himself to the ground and fired Gae Bolg with all his might.</p><br/><p>He felt like his left arm might explode. Gae Bolg emanated a strong light.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Gae Bolg hit Harad\u2019s right shoulder. The strong force of destruction that was inserted by Scathach, the queen of the land of shadows, was activated. A white light started to shine in the shoulder that it had hit and gulped down the black fire.</p><br/><p>Ragnar opened his eyes widely. And Harad was also shocked. Tae Ho cheered in the middle of his pain.</p><br/><p>But it only lasted for a moment.</p><br/><p>Harad teared off his shoulder. He had cut it down with his left hand. He got rid of the force of destruction along with his right arm and then gritted his teeth and laughed.</p><br/><p>A fierce fire surged up. Tae Ho couldn\u2019t listen the sound made when Harad\u2019s right arm fell. Ragnar\u2019s yell and Bracky\u2019s despair also didn\u2019t reach him.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho, that got bounced back, rolled on the ground. The bones of all his body got crushed. He coughed out blood while laying on the ground. His left arm that he had used to throw Gae Bolg didn\u2019t move, and he couldn\u2019t even feel it.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho rolled his eyes while being absent minded. It seemed like veins had exploded that his vision was red. He could see Harad approaching him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Heda.\u2019</p><br/><p>His lips didn\u2019t move. He felt like Idun\u2019s blessing was barely holding onto his life.</p><br/><p>It was the same as Black Fortress. No, it was worse than that. He didn\u2019t even have a piece of a golden apple now.</p><br/><p>Harad clenched his fist.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>Heda breathed roughly. Sweat flowed down like rain. Idun\u2019s blessing had activated from a place not that far away. There was only one person in this land that could activate Idun\u2019s blessing.</p><br/><p>\u2018No, no.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was the first time since that day.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t repeat what happened on that day.</p><br/><p>Heda turned back to a Valkyrie from a swan. Rather than cursing at her immature self, she tried to bring out a greater strength.</p><br/><p>But right at that moment.</p><br/><p>Heda turned back reflexively. She started to let out tears of joy unconsciously.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>Ragnar ground his teeth. Even though it was hard to even stand, he was raising his sword.</p><br/><p>Because he couldn\u2019t let him die in this place.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t someone to die here.</p><br/><p>He opened his mouth to try to get its attention for even a moment. He was even planning to tell him to kill him first.</p><br/><p>But then Ragnar saw. He laughed pleasingly with his mouth that was about to yell angrily.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>Harad though in the middle of his strong pain. He had to kill him. It wasn\u2019t because he had inflicted a wound as big as this.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know into what he would turn. He didn\u2019t know how Gae Bolg had appeared or how he could use it but he had to finish him here. Perhaps, it may be more important to do than killing the already broken Ragnar.</p><br/><p>The unknown warrior.</p><br/><p>He was covered in a golden light as he was dying.

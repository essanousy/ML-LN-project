Her voice was transmitted through mystical magic but you could still feel that she was sleepy and had just awakened.</p><br/><p>[Oh, sorry. Keep sleeping]</p><br/><p>[Ah, no. I\u2019m fine. What happened?]</p><br/><p>Adenmaha hurriedly grabbed Tae Ho that was trying to return.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho laughed at the rustling sound that was heard from beyond the door and then laughed and sent another mystical magic</p><br/><p>[I wondered if we could speak for a moment]</p><br/><p>[Wait a moment]</p><br/><p>Rustling sounds were heard again and then the door got opened. It seemed like she brushed her hair in a hurry that it was disheveled and he could see from between Adenmaha\u2019s white hair that Nidhogg and Hydra were sleeping while embracing each other and then a chair and a storybook was placed in it.</p><br/><p>\u2018It seems like she dozed off while reading them the book.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho thought of Adenmaha reading Nidhogg the storybook at Cuchulainn\u2019s words. It was a scene that made you smile by it\u2019s own.</p><br/><p>\u2018She\u2019s a nice kid.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster?\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha blinked and asked while Tae Ho agreed. Tae Ho checked on Nidhogg and Hydra once again and spoke to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something I want to test. Can we speak for a moment?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTest?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it won\u2019t last that long.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. It\u2019s not that I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha put a disappointed face at the word \u2018test\u2019 but then smiled brightly and answered.</p><br/><p>And about 10 minutes later.</p><br/><p>\u2018She has lost herself.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn spoke with a dumbfounded voice looking at Adenmaha swooning with a really red face.</p><br/><p>This was what Tae Ho had managed to accomplish(?) in mere minutes since he started to speak sweet words after he used Bragi\u2019s rune.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe, she will be fine right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho checked Adenmaha\u2019s state and asked hurriedly. He couldn\u2019t do anything as she just collapsed while smiling like a fool.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, she should. Don\u2019t worry too much.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho hurriedly used the \u2018eyes of the dragon\u2019 as Cuchulainn spoke with an indisposed voice. It seemed like there were nothing odd fortunately.</p><br/><p>\u2018I really did become the God of music.\u2019</p><br/><p>Just like Tae Ho had revealed himself, he hadn\u2019t been able to perfectly inherit the seat of God of music but he could still plentily strengthen the rune of Bragi.</p><br/><p>The Gods of Olympus obtained a great strength through their sacred force with the help of their believers but even if they didn\u2019t have the power of belief, they were still recognized by the world.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why Tae Ho was the God of music. He still hadn\u2019t obtained believers but no one could deny his divinity.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho checked that there was nothing wrong with Adenmaha and then let out a sigh of relief and thought about the results and process of the test.</p><br/><p>\u2018It certainly seems like the power becomes stronger if I aid it with a song. I will try to add an instrument to this later.\u2019</p><br/><p>Bragi was the God of music and poetry and Tae Ho was now the God of music.</p><br/><p>Apollo was a God that was especially excellent on playing a lyre made with the shell of a turtle so Tae Ho would be able to handle some instruments easily as he had inherited the seat from him.</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn imagined Tae Ho playing an instrument and whispering sweet words on Adenmaha\u2019s ear and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you hold any grudges towards Adenmaha?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ey, there\u2019s no way. I\u2019m doing this because I need to.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Making Adenmaha faint was necessary?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Umm, I didn\u2019t do it intentionally. Anyways, you will get to know tomorrow.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018It seems like you aren\u2019t answering me immediately nowadays. You always tell me to wait.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho smirked at Cuchulainn\u2019s rebuke and then decided to settle Adenmaha that had collapsed on her bed.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho apologized and then placed Adenmaha on the bed in a proper position and covered her with a blanked. He looked at her for a moment and then kissed her on the forehead.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet my blessing accompany you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehehe\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha laughed in a good mood as she was dreaming of something nice and Tae Ho also laughed after her and stroke her head a few times and then blessed her once again.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>\u201cI dreamed of something really nice.\u201d</p><br/><p>The next morning Adenmaha spoke with a dim face. Looking that she just flushed and smiled instead of telling him the details of the deram, it seemed like she was thinking that what happened last night was only a dream.</p><br/><p>\u2018Right, that should be the best.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tae Ho smiled bitterly while Cuchulainn clicked his tongue and then stroke her head a few times. It was because it was really cute to see her like it with a red face.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster?\u201d</p><br/><p>Adenmaha asked as if she didn\u2019t know what was going on but still liked Tae Ho\u2019s hand so Tae Ho just laughed.</p><br/><p>The battle had just ended and only a day had passed but the group didn\u2019t have the leisure to relax.</p><br/><p>The reason Tae Ho used Bragi\u2019s rune as soon as he woke up was also because they were filled with things to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cAthena-nim, I will ask you to do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave it to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Athena, that inherited the seat of the new Goddess of sun, faced Tae Ho fixedly and said. She had recovered quite a lot of strength because Apollo\u2019s divine power was added to her.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho consoled Echidna and Rasgrid that were standing next to Athena.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to make you dispatch only after a night. The damages yesterday weren\u2019t small either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, war is like that. But thanks to master all the injured ones recovered almost completely. Was that a golden apple tree? That was marvelous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Echidna giggled and pointed towards the polis of Apollo with her chin. The huge golden apple tree Tae Ho made with his saga was releasing a holy aura.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho nodded slightly and looked at Rasgrid.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will entrust it to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I will certainly accomplish what master has ordered me to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rasgrid put a faint smile and answered.</p><br/><p>The reason they got to go out early in the morning was simple.</p><br/><p>It was because the sacred forces of Apollo and Artemis became lands without owners.</p><br/><p>Even if Tae Ho had received the seat of the God of music, it was hard for him to take over Apollo\u2019s sacred force as he was a God of a foreign world.</p><br/><p>But it was different for Athena as she was already a high named Goddess. Now that she had received the seat of God of sun from Apollo, it would be good to receive everything he possessed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAtalante, thank you for your assistance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will protect the land of Artemis-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>Atalante expressed etiquette politely to Tae Ho. She had gotten a really important role just like Athena.</p><br/><p>It was hard even for Athena to take over Artemis\u2019 sacred force but the story changed if they had the Great hero of Artemis, Atalante.</p><br/><p>If they borrowed her strength they would be able to take over Artemis\u2019 sacred force a few times faster than when Athena did it alone.</p><br/><p>Athena and Atalante that had tagged together to take over the sacred force.</p><br/><p>Echidna, that would assist the two of them with her forces.</p><br/><p>The three Valkyries that were agents of Tae Ho and would observe the conquering process and arbitrate the two of them.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho sent away the group first and then returned to the polis of Apollo and started to do his work.</p><br/><p>The first thing he did was to have an individual talk.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Apollo-nim\u2019s lesser God Calliope, the muse of poetry.\u201d</p><br/><p>A black haired Goddess that was holding a nameplate in one hand smiled and said. She was speaking commonly but her voice was as beautiful as when someone sang.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hey, aren\u2019t you getting pushed by her?\u2019</p><br/><p>Cuchulainn laughed and Tae Ho activated Bragi\u2019s rune. The lesser Gods had moved their affiliation because they had already heard the situation from Apollo, but this was the first time they were meeting Tae Ho so you could say that they were still unmindful towards each other.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho gulped dry saliva once and then started to speak while placing his divinity in the rune of Bragi. She didn\u2019t faint like Adenmaha in a few minutes but her eyes looking at Tae Ho had certainly changed.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho faced the other five lesser Gods that were gathered in the polis in the same way he did with Calliope and then had some lunch and went out to the public square. He had already announced it so almost all the humans in this polis were gathered in this square.</p><br/><p>The voices of the people died as soon as Tae Ho appeared while winding himself with his dark blue divinity. Thousands of eyes only looked at Tae Ho and he faced them and activated his saga.</p><br/><p>[Saga: The Goddess of youth smiles under the golden apple tree]</p><br/><p>A golden apple tree surged up behind Tae Ho. The humans admired and Tae Ho smirked at that sat down below the tree and put his hands on the lyre he had prepared.</p><br/><p>It was an instrument he played for the first time in his life but he could know instinctively how to play it and what he had to do to make a finer sound. It was the power as the God of music.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at my eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho\u2019s song started with the play with the lyre for the first time in his life.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>Tae Ho\u2019s song wasn\u2019t a love song. It also wasn\u2019t a war song that increased your morale or a hymn that sang the beauty of nature.</p><br/><p>A song to advertise.</p><br/><p>A song telling what happened in Olympus and what he had done in that situation and also to spread his name and Idun\u2019s name.</p><br/><p>The power of Bragi\u2019s rune was certainly amazing. No matter how doubtful you were, you would end up believing that all his words were true while listening to his song. The people that didn\u2019t even know of Idun started to praise her gentleness and beauty and thanked deeply towards Tae Ho and the warriors of Asgard that were fighting for the sake of Olympus.</p><br/><p>They had defeated Artemis but there still a lot of enemies left.</p><br/><p>The army of Poseidon was approaching on Apollo\u2019s land in all sides and occupied almost all the lands Aphrodite and Ares, including Sparta.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t have that much time but even so they couldn\u2019t just attack rashly.</p><br/><p>Poseidon was a really strong existence, as he was the one that came next to Zeus in power and authority. The strength and scale of the army he ruled over couldn\u2019t be compared to Artemis or Dionysius at all.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why they would first stabilize their sacred force.</p><br/><p>They would gather people and prepare for the battle.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho\u2019s and Idun\u2019s started to get spread in various places of Olympus.</p><br/><p>Hermes roamed several places of Olympus and spread stories about Tae Ho. Tae Ho also evaded Poseidon and went to find the nymphs, heroes and Gods that had escaped and played his song and instrument.</p><br/><p>The effects were clear.Tae Ho didn\u2019t need to go out himself at all.</p><br/><p>The lesser Gods told Tae Ho\u2019s story.</p><br/><p>The humans that had become Tae Ho\u2019s believers told the ones that had escaped from war what they saw and experienced directly.</p><br/><p>The stories that were transmitted from mouth to mouth widened its diffusion rate and range every day that passed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is what you call a pyramidal scale.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know about that but you are clearly a scammer.\u2019</p><br/><p>The effects of the rumor didn\u2019t only end at spreading his name.</p><br/><p>Carving the name of a new God and preparing for a base for Tae Ho to spread his sacred force was also one of the effects.</p><br/><p>What he really aimed for was the concentration of strength.</p><br/><p>The ones that were hiding while avoiding the beings wanting to destroy the world started to have hope at Tae Ho\u2019s name. They came to find Tae Ho that had defeated Achilles, Ares and even Artemis and gathered in the polis of Apollo.</p><br/><p>And when a week passed like that.</p><br/><p>There was someone going to find Tae Ho in the polis of Apollo- that could now be called the city of Idun.</p><br/><p>He was the one that gave humans the first fire.</p><br/><p>He received a punishment of having his liver getting fed to eagles for more than a thousand years as punishment but regardless of that he still loved humans.</p><br/><p>His name was Prometheus.</p><br/><p>The God of humans.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 59 \u2013 God of conquest (2) &gt; End</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It was a disease that the word curse suited it well.</p><br/><p>The fight ended earlier than expected. Although there were hundreds of dead ones, it wasn\u2019t that all of them were warriors and they only knew how to charge forward.</p><br/><p>In addition they weren\u2019t good opponents. A force of eight warriors of Valhalla was enough to overwhelm hundreds of warriors of Midgard that were completely armed.</p><br/><p>But of course, as there were just too many dead ones there were some that passed through the defenses of the warriors of Valhalla, but Katren\u2019s garrison didn\u2019t just stay idle. They poured arrows to the dead ones that charged towards them in a manner you could say that was a bit excessive.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt has been tough because of a certain someone but i\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri faced Tae Ho, that had charged all the way here from a deep place in the forest, and said while putting on cold eyes and smiling at the same time. He could feel the pressure emanating from her as if telling him to explain properly the next time.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, you really are the best.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he came out shamelessly while raising a thumb Siri smirked and then loosened her expression. In the first place he had done that to rescue people. Siri also knew that it was unavoidable.</p><br/><p>As Siri\u2019s mood had eased up Tae Ho, that got relaxed, glanced towards the fortress.</p><br/><p>\u201cCaptain Siri, I will go first. It\u2019s because of Rolo.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a limit on how long you could maintain a summon with the summoning rock. There were things he had to do before sending back Rolo.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>Siri answered shortly and then pointed at the other warriors while slightly dropping her posture. Tae Ho looked at the warriors that were gathering in groups and ran towards the fortress hurriedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun\u2019s warrior!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun\u2019s warrior is coming!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOhh!\u201d</p><br/><p>The soldiers on top of the fortress and the evacuees that were still near the gates raised their voices.</p><br/><p>\u2018Did the shield maiden I saved spread the rumor?\u2019</p><br/><p>How did he know that he was Idun\u2019s warrior? Did he recognize the army flag?</p><br/><p>Whatever the case, it was a good reaction. Tae Ho maintained his serious expression instead of smiling and kicked the air to surge up to the top of the fortress. The soldiers and evacuees raised their voices again when they saw that he had jumped down the wall that was close to ten meters as if nothing.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun\u2019s warrior-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he had jumped towards the place where Rolo was, he could meet the ones he had saved as soon as he landed. They were Rolo, that was putting on a vague expression while carrying Idun\u2019s army flag in his saddle, and the three children and the black haired woman next to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are all safe. It\u2019s all thanks to Idun\u2019s warrior-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>The shield maiden blushed and then bowed towards Tae Ho and pointed at the three children.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy name is Helga, the daughter of Ivar. These are my siblings Gudmund, Gudrid, and Erik.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were two boys and one girl.</p><br/><p>\u2018They were brothers with a bit of difference in their age?\u2019</p><br/><p>He thought that they were children of a rich family and their guard.</p><br/><p>Looking at the shieldmaiden more closely he thought that she would be a teen as she still had a childish face. In the other hand, the biggest kid among the children seemed to be barely seven or eight years old.</p><br/><p>But it was then. The warriors near them put on surprised faces and then looked at each other and started to whisper among themselves.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are the kids of king Ivar?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that girl is princess Helga?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a beauty just like the rumors.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although they had whispered among themselves, you could still hear everything as they were on top of the silent fortress.</p><br/><p>[Daughter of king Ivar]</p><br/><p>[Princess of Kataron]</p><br/><p>[Shieldmaiden Helga]</p><br/><p>He became certain after looking with the \u2018eyes of the dragon\u2019. It wasn\u2019t a rich family but she was of royalty.</p><br/><p>But of course there was a low probability for them to be successors of a huge kingdom. Even king Sven merely ruled two cities and a few towns. Based on Siri\u2019s explanation there were small kingdoms the size of cities near Kalik. Ivar king should probably be the same.</p><br/><p>Helga heard the whispers around her and then took a deep breath and said after fixing her expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing to say this to Idun\u2019s warrior but king Ivar, that rules a part of Kataron, is my father. As my father was on an expedition I escaped along my brothers.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho had studied many things about Kalik\u2019s surroundings with Siri while crossing the sea. When he spread a map in his head he could immediately know Kataron\u2019s size and location. Just as expected, it was a small kingdom comparable to the island king Sven ruled.</p><br/><p>\u2018They had a vague relationship with Katren, right?\u2019</p><br/><p>They did trade between them but were in guard against each other.</p><br/><p>He had heard that the other small kingdoms near it were hesitation in several means as king Ivar was leading a really powerful army.</p><br/><p>\u2018Whatever the case, they are royalty.\u2019</p><br/><p>Be it small or big, it was still a kingdom. In addition the ones in front of Tae Ho were the princesses and princes.</p><br/><p>If he did well, won\u2019t he gain diplomatic ties with them? Just like Athena, the capital of Greece, worshipped the Goddess Athena.</p><br/><p>He started to see Helga in a new light. He felt like he could see the words [Idun\u2019s warrior(in the future)] or [Estimated to enter the army: Idun\u2019s legion] above her head.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s calm down for now.\u2019</p><br/><p>Rolo\u2019s vague eyes looking at him helped him in calming down.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho fixed his expression and then hit his chest twice just like Valhalla\u2019s etiquette and spoke to Helga.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have gone through a lot with the body of a princess. Your courage and commitment to protect your brothers until the end is really amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, no. I just did the obvious as the eldest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Helga blushed and bowed. But looking that the corner of her mouth was curled up, it seemed like she was really happy to have heard that.</p><br/><p>\u201cI also did the obvious as Idun\u2019s warrior.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho lightly patted on Helga\u2019s shoulders and said. Helga looked at Tae Ho\u2019s hand that was on her shoulder and flinched, and then acted as if she didn\u2019t know what to do and hurriedly expressed her manners.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will be going now. I will never forget this grace.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWarm up as the night is cold.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tae Ho took out a coat he had put in Unnir as a females clothe and gave it to Helga. And then Helga\u2019s face became more red than it was before and bowed again.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Helga left with the children. And Tae Ho, that was looking at that, let out a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>\u2018It was hard.\u2019</p><br/><p>He had taken Rasgrid\u2019s or Reginleif\u2019s way of talking and pretended to act as a warrior of Valhalla filled with dignity, but it was hard to do something he didn\u2019t usually do.</p><br/><p>\u201cRolo, you have done well.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Tae Ho smirked and said, Rolo turned his head and snorted. Although it was fainter than before, he still had the feather decoration that was a characteristic of Valkyries in his head.</p><br/><p>[The first male Valkyrie(Temporary)]</p><br/><p>[Rolo that feels strange]</p><br/><p>Fortunately enough, it seemed like there was no confusion in his identity.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho slightly glanced at Rolo\u2019s lower half and let out a sigh of relief and after that he patted Rolo\u2019s legs.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou got the title of the first, congratulations.\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a man Valkyrie but a male Valkyrie, so it was good to say that he had written history anew, but Rolo kept looking at him vaguely.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho placed the things he had prepared in a pocket that was hanging in the saddle instead of taking it off.</p><br/><p>He was returning the summoning rocks that had used all of their magic power and a letter to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cSend it to Heda, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Rolo couldn\u2019t speak but could understand words really well. He nodded moderately and then looked at Tae Ho as if asking if he could return back to eat. Tae Ho used the summoning rock again to send him back instead of answering.</p><br/><p>As the big gryphon disappeared in front of their eyes, the soldiers that got surprised raised their voices. Tae Ho was wondering whether he should preach them about Idun\u2019s beauty and wisdom now that he had caught their attention but he changed his thoughts. It was because Siri and the warriors had reached the gate and Ingrid, that wasn\u2019t seen anywhere, appeared on top of the fortress.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdun\u2019s warrior Tae Ho, you have done well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he approached Ingrid, she spoke towards him first. He was really thankful towards her because he called him as Idun\u2019s warrior instead of just warrior like she usually did.</p><br/><p>Although Ingrid seemed to be the silent type as she always had a business-like expression, but he was able to read her expression after spending a few days with her. Although her face seemed to be the same every time, she was expressing her feelings through the faint movements of her eyebrows and eyes.</p><br/><p>Ingrid put on a smile only Tae Ho could barely recognize and then put pointed at the young man putting on a nervous expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is Katren\u2019s defense commander Blotan, son of Erik.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreetings to Idun\u2019s warrior.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNice to meet you.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Blotan and Tae Ho ended their short greeting, Ingrid spoke again.</p><br/><p>\u201cKing Catil, the governor of the city, is coming. It feels like it would turn to become a long story but will you participate in the conference? You can rest as you have just returned from battle. King Catil will prepare a conference room.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed like the last words were directed to Blotan rather to Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho and Blotan, that had flinched, turned to look at a fat man that was being escorted by guards, nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will participate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, he\u2019s coming over there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ingrid turned towards the fat man- king Catil.</p><br/><p>&amp;</p><br/><p>The conference with king Catil took place in a big mansion located at the center of the city.</p><br/><p>King Catil was hiding his expression but he seemed to have many complaints.</p><br/><p>Like he was going to return to the mansion again so why did he have to go to the walls and why did they end up letting in the evacuees inside the fortress?</p><br/><p>It seemed like he had almost never lowered himself below someone else or endured it.</p><br/><p>But it seemed like he still knew how to differentiate a bit that he didn\u2019t act rudely openly towards Ingrid and the warriors of Valhalla.</p><br/><p>\u2018How new.\u2019</p><br/><p>Thinking about it, king Catil should be the image of a standard king.</p><br/><p>After having seen warriors of Valhalla that were all bright and good people, when he saw a rotten person in a really long while he felt more marveled rather than displeasure.</p><br/><p>The people that were in the conference room could be divided in three groups.</p><br/><p>King Catil and his advisor, Blotan and his followers.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho, Bracky and Ingrid.</p><br/><p>Lastly, princess Helga of Kataron.</p><br/><p>King Catil sent a sly look towards Helga without even trying to hide it. It was obvious as the successor of a neighboring kingdom had come rolling while they were glaring at themselves without fighting. In addition, Helga was also a beauty. The eyes of king Catil were filled with lewdness.</p><br/><p>Helga pretended to act calm but it seemed like it was still hard to endure it that she kept sending glances to Tae Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cSaying it briefly, the place the epidemic got originated at is from a forest near Kataron?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a high probability.\u201d</p><br/><p>Helga answered hurriedly at Ingrid\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>The epidemic that originated in the forest got spread in small villages that were located in hills or the mountains but it ended up spreading to a village that belonged to Kataron and even affected it.</p><br/><p>Ingrid paused for a moment and then looked at the map that was placed in the middle of the table. The direction was the same to the direction Garmr\u2019s soul fragment pointed at.</p><br/><p>\u201cShieldmaiden Helga, where is the army of king Ivar? Can I know the situation of Kataron?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUm\u2026By now, father should have also heard of the situation. Hella\u2019s curse is a really dangerous plague, so I think that he returned to deal with it. For Kataron\u2019s situation\u2026..i\u2019m sorry. Even I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>She was staying in a village outside of Kataron with her brothers and had escaped. It was impossible to know to what extent the disease had spread.</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand. Erasing the origin of the plague is the priority here so it would be good to join with king Ivar.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you talking about crossing through the infected regions?\u201d</p><br/><p>Blotan, that was silent until now, got surprised and asked.</p><br/><p>Ingrid nodded with a calm face.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have a flying ship\u2026.that was bestowed by Idun-nim. It isn\u2019t a problem crossing through the infected region.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ingrid had finished speaking and looked at Tae Ho. Now that she had determined herself to help him, she was really doing her best.</p><br/><p>\u2018It looks like a powerpoint presentation.\u2019</p><br/><p>Just like when they presented a mobile game in dramas or only drinking a beverage from one brand and showing it.</p><br/><p>While Tae Ho was forcing himself not to laugh at Ingrid\u2019s cute side, the advisor that was next to king Catil put on a troubled face and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen our Katren\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKatren\u2019s walls are high and solid. There won\u2019t be any trouble even if we leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ingrid cutted his words immediately. King Catil put on a dissatisfied face but he just shut his mouth and didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>Tae Ho looked at the place the eyes of king Catil were looking at and then said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHelga, you and your brothers will come with us. It will be exhausting to leave immediately but get ready to depart.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand. Thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Helga answered immediately. King Catil turned to look at Tae Ho as if he could do such things but he couldn\u2019t open his mouth this time either.</p><br/><p>He had been planning to capture the successors of king Ivar in this opportunity.</p><br/><p>Actually that was a mundane thing, and it wasn\u2019t that king Catil was doing anything evil in particular. But whatever the case, he would have to deal with the thousand of evacuees that would remain in Katren.</p><br/><p>However Tae Ho didn\u2019t need to side with Katren. He would be leaving Katren soon so it was obvious that he would invest more in Kataron that had a well polished base and where he would be acting from now on.</p><br/><p>\u2018Right, now that it came to this why don\u2019t I make a national religion?\u2019</p><br/><p>He would build a city with Idun\u2019s name and also build a big shrine!</p><br/><p>That was Tae Ho\u2019s ambition but it seemed like Ingrid mistook Tae Ho\u2019s eyes and shook her head while looking at Helga that was looking at Tae Ho with her face flushed.</p><br/><p>However she really was sincere. She prioritized her things and stood up.</p><br/><p>\u201cKing Catil, I entrust you the evacuees. You and the evacuees are all humans of Midgard.\u201d</p><br/><p>King Catil\u2019s face stiffened when he heard the warning not to mix the mundane things with the things related to Valhalla.</p><br/><p>As soon as they got out of the conference room, Ingrid gathered the warriors of Valhalla that were resting. It was doubtful as to how Garmr\u2019s soul fragment was influencing things but whatever the case, Hella\u2019s curse was a terrible disease they had to take care of.</p><br/><p>If more time passed, there was a high probability that vampires like the Stragos or undead monsters would appear.</p><br/><p>Hella\u2019s curse became stronger the more dead ones there were.</p><br/><p>The flying pirate ship, that was carrying the warriors of Valhalla, left Katren.</p><br/><p>King Catil and the several others looked at them and had their own thoughts.</p><br/><p>And at the same time, when everyone looked at the flying pirate ship.</p><br/><p>There was one more existence leaving Katren.</p><br/><p>&lt; Episode 22 \u2013 Saga (5) &gt; End</p><hr/><br/><p>TL note: Thanks for reading~</p><br/>\n</div>"}

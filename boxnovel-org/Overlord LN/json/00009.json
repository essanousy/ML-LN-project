It was so named because it was defended by three layers of walls. The districts enclosed by each concentric circle of the walls were distinctly different from each other.</p><br/><p>The outermost district was sometimes used to billet the troops from the Royal Army, and so it was fully furnished with barracks and other military facilities.</p><br/><p>The innermost district was the administrative area of the city. In addition, the district also contained storehouses for combat rations. Thus, it was heavily guarded.</p><br/><p>Between these two areas was the residential district, where the people of E-Rantel made their homes. This place best fit the image that came to mind when one thought of a city.</p><br/><p>There were several plazas here, and the largest of them was called the Central Plaza. It was filled with stalls selling vegetables, spices, and other such commercial products.</p><br/><p>Amidst the crowds, the stall owners energetically shouted their sales pitches to the people walking by, while the older women haggled with the merchants as they looked for fresh food. Drawn by fragrant scents, young men purchased skewers of roasted meat which oozed with warm juices.</p><br/><p>The rowdy, energetic atmosphere of this place should have lasted until the sun went down. However, it suddenly went silent as a pair of figures emerged from a five story building nearby.</p><br/><p>Everyone in the plaza froze where they stood, their eyes were drawn to the two of them.</p><br/><p>One of these two people was a girl, who looked to be in her late teens. Her tapered eyes gleamed like onyxes, while her thick and lustrous black hair was tied into a ponytail. Her snow white skin shone like pearls in the sun.</p><br/><p>What drew their attention most was the air of elegance which surrounded her, followed closely by her exotic beauty that would make anyone do a double take. Although the dark brown robe she wore was plain in make, it looked like an opulent dress on her.</p><br/><p>The gender of her partner was unclear. Or rather, there was no way to tell her partner\u2019s gender.</p><br/><p>Someone muttered, \u201cDark Warrior.\u201d</p><br/><p>Indeed, that person was sheathed in an intricately engraved suit of full plate armor that was edged in gold. There was no way to see that person\u2019s face through the narrow slits of the closed helm which that person wore. A pair of greatswords were visible below that person\u2019s flowing red cape, and they looked as impressive as that person\u2019s armor.</p><br/><p>The two of them looked around, and the fully armored person took a step forward.</p><br/><p>The onlookers watched the pair vanish into the distance, and then immediately began whispering about what they had seen. They did not seem afraid of their arms and armor.</p><br/><p>That was because the building the pair had just left was called the \u201cAdventurer\u2019s Guild,\u201d It was a place that only monster-hunting professionals would visit, so it was hardly strange to see armed people coming out of there. In fact, several other similarly equipped people had left the building in the meantime. Those with keen eyes might have noticed a pair of copper plates hanging around the necks of that pair.</p><br/><p>That said, the two of them had drawn all that attention because of the woman\u2019s beauty and her partner\u2019s magnificent set of full plate.</p><br/><p>\u2666 \u2666 \u2666</p><br/><p>The pair walked quietly down a narrow road.</p><br/><p>Sunlight reflected off the water caught in wagon-ruts on the road. Unlike proper cobbled roads, said water mixed with the earth and sand, which made for treacherous footing. A moment\u2019s carelessness might have led to a fall, but the two of them possessed excellent balance, and so they moved along the road almost as quickly as a proper one.</p><br/><p>After verifying that there was nobody else around them, the light-footed woman turned to the fully-armored person beside her and said:</p><br/><p>\u201cAinz-sa\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014No, my name is Momon. Neither are you Narberal Gamma, battle maid (Pleiades) of the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick, but Nabe, Momon\u2019s adventuring partner.\u201d</p><br/><p>The person in full plate \u2014 Ainz \u2014 interrupted the girl \u2014 Narberal \u2014 halfway through her reply.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! My apologies, Momon-sama.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, don\u2019t call me -sama. We are simple adventurers, and companions. It would be weird to address me like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cB-But! How could I possibly be so disrespectful to the Supreme One?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz gestured at Narberal to keep her voice down. She had raised it in her excitement. Then, in a tone that was somewhere between resignation and helplessness, he replied:</p><br/><p>\u201cLike I\u2019ve already said, several times, in this place I am Momon the Dark\u2026 no, just Momon, and your partner. So don\u2019t call me -sama. That\u2019s an order.\u201d</p><br/><p>After a short silence, Narberal reluctantly replied:</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood, Momon-sa\u2014n.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it, this is fine too. Actually, dropping the -san would be good as well. After all, how shall I say this, addressing your partner as -san might make people think there\u2019s a distance between us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026 would that not be too disrespectful\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz shrugged as Narberal mumbled.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe cannot reveal our true identities. You understand that, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Your tone\u2026 mm, forget it. In any case\u2026 what I want to say is that you must be very careful in your words and actions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Understood, Momon-sa\u2014san. However, is it really all right for me to accompany you? Would not the beautiful and gentle Albedo-sama be better for this task?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlbedo\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz\u2019s words betrayed his complicated feelings as he replied:</p><br/><p>\u201cI need her to manage Nazarick for me while I am travelling.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Though I fear to offend you, could the task of running Nazarick not be given to Cocytus-sama? The Guardians all say this too\u2026 that for the sake of your safety, Albedo-sama is the best choice as your companion. Do you not think so?\u201d</p><br/><p>Narberal\u2019s question made Ainz smile bitterly.</p><br/><p>Among all the Guardians, Albedo had objected the most strenuously when Ainz had announced his decision to visit E-Rantel. It began when she learned that she would not be able to accompany Ainz on his journey.</p><br/><p>After the transition to this mysterious new world, Ainz had gone for a walk without his vassals, something which Albedo blamed herself for. Thus he could not rebuke her too harshly. However, this was a deliberate expedition, unlike the stroll he had taken last time, and so he had to stick to his guns.</p><br/><p>As a Guardian she would obey his orders without fail, even if they conflicted with her own opinions. Yet, Ainz did not think of that as a good thing. All the Guardians were the product of his fellow guild members\u2019 hard work, and he felt guilty about forcing his will upon them.</p><br/><p>Therefore, Ainz tried to persuade Albedo \u2014 who staunchly disagreed with him \u2014 to come around to his way of thinking. However, neither of them could accept the other\u2019s opinions. At first, Ainz thought they would be deadlocked forever, but after Demiurge whispered something into Albedo\u2019s ear, her resistance suddenly evaporated. In the end, she fully approved of his journey and even sent him off with a smile.</p><br/><p>Until now, he still did not know what Demiurge had said to her. Ainz was a little uneasy about what could have made Albedo reverse her opinion so suddenly.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I did not bring her along because I trust her more than anyone else. It is because she is in Nazarick that I can leave it in peace.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see! In other words, Albedo-sama is the closest person to you, Momon-sa\u2014n?\u201d</p><br/><p>While he did not reply, \u201cMm, well, kind of,\u201d he did nod in response to Narberal\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am fully aware that this is potentially dangerous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz raised his gauntleted right hand and wiggled its ring finger.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, I must go in person. If I stay in Nazarick, there is a chance that I might make a miscalculation. Therefore, I need to personally make contact with the outside world\u2026 indeed, there are other methods I could use, but all of them make me uneasy, given that there is so little we know about the situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Narberal replied, \u201cI see,\u201d with a look of understanding on her face.</p><br/><p>Ainz narrowed his eyes at her through the slits of his helmet, and then asked in a somewhat uneasy tone:</p><br/><p>\u201cIncidentally, I have a question\u2026 Do you think humans are inferior lifeforms?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, they are. Humans are worthless trash.\u201d</p><br/><p>Narberal delivered her answer with firm conviction and without a moment\u2019s hesitation. Ainz muttered, \u201cAh, so you felt that way too,\u201d but his voice was too soft to reach Narberal\u2019s ears.</p><br/><p>After that, he continued grumbling, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to bring her along because her personality makes her react poorly to humans. Looks like I should have been certain of my subordinates\u2019 personalities beforehand. \u201d</p><br/><p>One of the reasons why he had not taken Albedo with him was because she firmly believed that humans were inferior lifeforms. If he brought someone like that into a highly populated city and then took his eyes off her for just a moment, there was a very real possibility that he might look back to find a gore soaked abattoir. In addition, Albedo had no disguise skills and could not conceal her horns and wings, which was another point against her.</p><br/><p>The greatest reason, however, was one that he could never speak out loud.</p><br/><p>That was the fact that Ainz was a mere salaryman, and he had no confidence in running an organization if he had to rely on reports from others, with no direct observation on his part. Because of that, he handed the task of managing the Nazarick to the talented Albedo. If one had a capable subordinate, allowing them to take charge was a wise gesture; interference from an incompetent superior would only lead to tragedy.</p><br/><p>In addition Albedo was bound to Ainz by the twin shackles of \u201clove\u201d and \u201cloyalty.\u201d That was why Ainz could leave the operations of the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick to her.</p><br/><p>Love, huh\u2026</p><br/><p>Every time he saw Albedo, and every time she declared her love for him, Ainz was reminded of the mistake he made in altering Albedo\u2019s settings. Indeed, in the last moments before the game ended, he had changed Albedo\u2019s character settings so that she would deeply love Momonga \u2014 in other words, Ainz. Of course, he did not know that he would be transported to this new world. It had merely been a final, little joke.</p><br/><p>Still, when he thought about it \u2014 even if Albedo did not mind \u2014 what would his friend Tabula Smaragdina think about what Ainz had done?</p><br/><p>What if it were himself? What if his comrades had interfered with his hand-created NPC (Pandora\u2019s Actor)\u2026</p><br/><p>Worse still, he had made use of Albedo\u2019s absolute loyalty toward him for his own gain. He hated himself for that.</p><br/><p>Ainz shook his head to clear away these dark thoughts. Although his undead body automatically suppressed any strong emotions he felt, he still experienced petty emotions like those as keenly as he had when he was human. When he fully assumed an undead state of mind, perhaps he would no longer feel that sense of guilt.</p><br/><p>Distracted by these thoughts, the helmed Ainz turned to Narberal and said:</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Nabe, I won\u2019t tell you to cast away those thoughts, but at the very least, you must control yourself. This is a human town, and we do not know what exceptional individuals they have among them. Therefore, we should try our best not to make enemies.\u201d</p><br/><p>Narberal bowed deeply to him to show her loyalty and obedience. Ainz extended his hand to her, to bid her raise her head. Then he continued:</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is one more thing. When we intend to fight in earnest, we might radiate a\u2026 killing intent, which humans might be able to sense. Well, something like that might happen. Therefore, you are not to get serious without my permission. Do you understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand, Momon-sa\u2014n.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cVery good\u2026 Then, the inn we heard about should be nearby.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz looked around.</p><br/><p>There were several shops open for business nearby, their customers filing in and out of them. To the side were several people in work aprons, carrying goods.</p><br/><p>In this densely populated commercial district, Ainz and Narberal had to look for the inn by inspecting the pictures on the shops\u2019 signs. This was because neither of them could read this country\u2019s language.</p><br/><p>Before long, Ainz found the picture that he was looking for. His steps quickened, and Narberal followed suit.</p><br/><p>He scraped off the mud caked on his sabatons, climbed the steps to the western-style saloon doors, and opened them with both hands.</p><br/><p>The windows were closed, and so the interior was somewhat dark. People who were used to the light outside would probably not be able to see their hands stretched out in front of their faces. However, Ainz possessed darkvision, and he could see clearly with this meager amount of illumination.</p><br/><p>The inside of the building was quite spacious. The first floor was a dining area, with a counter further within. That counter was backed by shelves that contained dozens of bottles of alcohol. The door beside the counter most likely led to a kitchen.</p><br/><p>A spiral staircase turned up in the corner of the dining area. According to the receptionist at the guild, the guest rooms were located on the second and third floors. One could see the scattered customers within seated around several round tables. Almost all of them were men, and the promise of violence hung heavily over them.</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s attention was on Ainz. They looked at him as though they were sizing him up. The only person who did not pay attention to Ainz was a woman seated in a corner. She was staring intently at a small bottle on her table.</p><br/><p>This tavern scene made Ainz furrow his nonexistent brows under his helmet.</p><br/><p>He had expected this sort of thing, but this place was filthier than he had imagined.</p><br/><p>There were dirty and disgusting places in YGGDRASIL, of course. Even the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick which Ainz ruled over contained such places, such as Kyouhukou\u2019s room, the Venomous Cave, and so on.</p><br/><p>However, the filth here was different from those places.</p><br/><p>The floor was covered in scraps of mysterious food and unknown liquids, while the walls were stained and there were chunks of some moldy substance in the corners of the room\u2026</p><br/><p>Ainz sighed internally, and looked into the tavern.</p><br/><p>A man in a dirty apron stood there, his stout arms protruding from his rolled-up sleeves. They were covered in several scars, and Ainz could not tell if they were caused by the claws of wild beasts or by blades of some sort.</p><br/><p>He looked somewhere between imposing and bestial, and there were scars on his face as well. His head was shaved completely bald, without a single hair left standing on his scalp.</p><br/><p>This man, who looked more like a bouncer than an innkeeper, sized up Ainz as he held a mop in one hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cA room, huh. For how long?\u201d a voice like a broken bell called out to Ainz.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe wish to stay for one night.\u201d</p><br/><p>The innkeeper replied crudely, \u201c\u2026A copper plate, huh. A night is five coppers. The food\u2019s oatmeal and vegetables; meat\u2019s an extra copper. Might be getting days-old bread instead of the oatmeal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it is at all possible, I would like a double room.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz thought he could hear the man snorting.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026In this town, there\u2019s three inns that cater to adventurers, and mine\u2019s the worst of these three\u2026 you know why the guild sent you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI do not. Could you tell me why?\u201d</p><br/><p>Faced with Ainz\u2019s answer, the innkeeper furrowed his frown and turned a frightening look upon him.</p><br/><p>\u201cUse your brains a little! Or is that flashy helmet of yours empty inside, huh!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz remained calm, despite the innkeeper\u2019s annoyed retort. Perhaps his ability to weather this childish tantrum was the result of experiencing that battle several days ago.</p><br/><p>That battle \u2014 as well as the information squeezed out of the prisoners they had taken \u2014 had allowed Ainz to understand how powerful he was. Because of that, he could calmly face this shouting.</p><br/><p>The innkeeper seemed surprised to see Ainz\u2019s reaction, and said:</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026You\u2019ve got some guts, huh\u2026 The people who stay here are mostly copper or iron plate adventurers. If you\u2019ve got some strength, you can form a party here, if you\u2019re lucky. Therefore, there\u2019s no better place than this to find party members whose strength matches yours\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Something seemed to flash through the innkeeper\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine if you want to sleep in a room, but if you don\u2019t make contacts here, you won\u2019t be able to find party members. If you can\u2019t form a well-balanced, strong team, you\u2019ll die out there against the monsters. That\u2019s why novices with no comrades advertise themselves in places with a lot of people. So I\u2019ll ask you one more time: do you want to sleep in the dormitory or in a double room, huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA double room. And I\u2019ll pass on the food.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCheh, another punk who doesn\u2019t appreciate other\u2019s kindness\u2026 or are you trying to say that you\u2019re something else and that full plate isn\u2019t for show? Ah, forget it, that\u2019ll be seven coppers a night. Upfront, of course.\u201d</p><br/><p>The innkeeper extended his hand in one smooth motion.</p><br/><p>Ainz stepped forward, followed by Narberal. The two of them were bathed in the appraising looks of everyone in the room \u2014 when suddenly, someone stuck a foot into Ainz\u2019s path, as though to prevent Ainz from moving forward.</p><br/><p>Ainz halted, and turned to the man who had stuck his foot out.</p><br/><p>He had an annoying smile on his face, which was mirrored by everyone else at his table. They stared at Ainz and Narberal.</p><br/><p>Neither the innkeeper or the other customers stepped forward to stop this. They were watching silently.</p><br/><p>Although everyone seemed to be uninterested in the proceedings, or looking forward to a good show, there were quite a few of them who were intently studying the situation.</p><br/><p>Give me a break\u2026</p><br/><p>Ainz sighed, and lightly kicked away the foot in front of him.</p><br/><p>The man suddenly stood up, as though he had been waiting just for that. Since he was unarmored, his bulging muscles were clearly visible under his clothes. He had a necklace like Ainz did, but his was an iron plate, which swayed as the man moved.</p><br/><p>\u201cOi, oi, that hurt.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man approached Ainz, speaking in a threatening manner as he did. He had a gauntlet on his hand, which he must have put on while standing up. It creaked as he clenched his fist.</p><br/><p>The two of them were roughly the same height, and they glared at each other with wrathful eyes. It seemed a bit too close for a fistfight. Ainz decided to fire the first shot:</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so? I must have missed the foot in front of me because of this closed helm, or perhaps your leg was just too short\u2026 well, that\u2019s my excuse, can you forgive me for that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Bastard.\u201d</p><br/><p>A dangerous look crept into the man\u2019s eyes as Ainz\u2019s taunt sank in. However, he turned his angry gaze to Narberal, who was standing behind Ainz, plastering his eyes on her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an annoying fellow\u2026 But I\u2019m a generous man. As long as you lend me your woman for a night, I\u2019ll forgive you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKu, kukuku\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz could not help but sneer at the man, and he lightly raised his hand to keep Narberal from stepping forward.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s nothing. I couldn\u2019t help but laugh at the way you sound like a stereotypical punk. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWha?\u201d</p><br/><p>The angry man\u2019s face flushed red.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, before we start, can I ask a question? Are you stronger than Gazef Stronoff?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWha? The hell are you talking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see, it\u2019s all clear from your reaction. If it\u2019s like that, then I won\u2019t even need to play with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz swiftly grabbed the man by the neck, and then hoisted his body off the ground.</p><br/><p>The man could not even dodge, much less resist the sudden clinch. He went, \u201cUoh!\u201d in surprise as he was lifted up. The men around him who were watching the show only added to the excitement. How strong was this guy, if he could lift a grown man with one arm? The imaginations of everyone present were now considering that topic.</p><br/><p>A wave of surprise and consternation swept the inn. As though to shatter the atmosphere of shock in the air, Ainz raised the man \u2014 whose legs were dangling and kicking furiously \u2014 and gently tossed him away.</p><br/><p>Well, it was gentle for Ainz.</p><br/><p>The thrown man flew in a neat trajectory with frightening speed, skimming the ceiling as he went, and fell heavily to the ground.</p><br/><p>The sounds of the man\u2019s body striking a nearby table, an object on the table breaking, the planks of the table splitting apart and the man\u2019s own howls of pain blended together and echoed through the tavern. Then, the whole place fell silent, as though startled by the noise. However\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cOgyaaaa\u2014!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014A beat later, the woman seated at that table emitted a strange wail. It was a cry of despair that a soul might make as it rose to heaven.</p><br/><p>No, it would only be natural to scream like this if a man suddenly fell out of the sky and landed in front of someone. There was another reason here, mixed into the shocked cry.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Then, what do the rest of you plan to do? Can you save me the trouble and come all at once? It\u2019s foolish to waste time on things like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz\u2019s words were directed at the other men seated at the table of the fellow he had just thrown. They immediately got his meaning, and hurriedly lowered their heads.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? N-No! Our buddy offended you! We\u2019re very sorry!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Mm. I forgive you. Besides, it hardly inconvenienced me. However, you had best pay the innkeeper for that table.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf, of course! We will pay the full price!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Ainz felt the matter was at an end and turned away, a voice froze him in his tracks.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait wait wait!\u201d</p><br/><p>Turning around, he saw the woman who had made that weird cry just now. She was stomping up to him.</p><br/><p>She looked to be in her twenties or younger, and her red hair was messily-cut, yet at a good length for movement. It could not be described as neat by any stretch of the word. To be more precise, it resembled a bird\u2019s nest.</p><br/><p>She had a pretty face and a keen edge to her eyes. She did not wear makeup, and her healthy body was tanned brown by the sun. Her arms were muscular and her palms were covered in calluses from wielding a sword. The word that first came to mind when he saw her was not \u201cwoman,\u201d but \u201cwarrior.\u201d</p><br/><p>A small iron plate hung around her chest, and it shook mightily with every step she took.</p><br/><p>\u201cSee what you\u2019ve done!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat have I done?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHah!? Don\u2019t you even know what you did?\u201d</p><br/><p>The woman pointed at the shattered table.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou threw that guy over and broke my potion, my precious potion!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd!? You\u2014!\u201d</p><br/><p>Her gaze sharpened further, and her tone became low and dangerous.</p><br/><p>\u201cPay me back for my potion.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026It\u2019s just a potion\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I starved and scrimped and saved to buy that potion today! And now you broke it! I\u2019ve always believed that I could get through a dangerous adventure as long as I had a potion, but now you\u2019ve shattered my hopes and dreams! And you\u2019ve still got an attitude like that? Ahhhh, it makes me so mad!\u201d</p><br/><p>The woman drew closer to Ainz.</p><br/><p>It seemed like a wild bull had just seen red and was approaching him.</p><br/><p>Ainz suppressed a sigh at himself. Indeed, he had made a mistake by throwing the man without thinking about where he might land. However, Ainz had his own reasons for not paying compensation that easily.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026How about asking that man to pay you back? If he hadn\u2019t stuck his short leg out, this tragedy would not have taken place. Am I wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz\u2019s gaze swept across the man\u2019s buddies through the slit of his helmet.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, yes, that\u2019s right\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it, I don\u2019t care who pays me back as long as it\u2019s a potion or its equivalent in cash\u2026 although, that potion was worth one gold and ten silvers.\u201d</p><br/><p>The men lowered their heads. It would seem they did not have the money to pay. Thus, the girl turned on Ainz again.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs I thought, these drunkards wouldn\u2019t have that sort of money. Well, seeing as you\u2019re dressed in such a flashy suit of armor, surely you must have a healing potion, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>No wonder, Ainz thought. So that was why this woman was asking Ainz to pay up.</p><br/><p>He thought briefly about it, composed himself, and replied:</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I don\u2019t\u2026 although, that was a recovery potion, am I correct?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed. I saved up for every little\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014All right, I get it, that\u2019s enough. I\u2019ll pay you back with another potion, and we\u2019ll be even.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz handed her a Minor Healing Potion. She looked at the potion bottle in surprise, then reluctantly accepted it.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026This should be fine, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Mm, I guess.\u201d</p><br/><p>The woman seemed to have more to say, but Ainz cast aside his doubts. The more important thing was his uneasiness over whether Narberal would do something big and blow their cover.</p><br/><p>Narberal still had a combative look in her eyes, even though Ainz had already chided her. Some of them seemed to sense her hostility and felt uneasy.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Ainz curtly told Narberal. They went before the innkeeper and Ainz withdrew a single silver piece from his leather purse before placing it on the crudely-made counter.</p><br/><p>The innkeeper silently slipped it into his pant pocket and returned Ainz several copper pieces.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm. Here\u2019s six coppers back.\u201d</p><br/><p>He placed the copper coins onto Ainz\u2019s gauntleted hand, and then laid a small key on the counter.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst room on the right once you go up the stairs. You can put your gear into the chests at the foot of the bed. This goes without saying, but don\u2019t barge into people\u2019s rooms without permission. Might lead to trouble if someone gets the wrong idea. Although, it\u2019s a pretty good way to let people know you. You look like the sort who can handle all kinds of problems. Just don\u2019t give me a problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>The innkeeper narrowed his eyes at the man that Ainz had thrown, who was moaning on the floor.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood. Also, I\u2019ll need a basic adventurer\u2019s kit for us. We\u2019ve lost some of our things and the Guild said that you\u2019d prepare one for us if we asked.\u201d</p><br/><p>The innkeeper looked at Ainz and Narberal, and then looked straight at Ainz\u2019s purse.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, I got it. I\u2019ll get it ready by dinner. Just be ready to pay.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood. Then, Nabe, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz brought Narberal up the old staircase. The wood creaked under his feet as he headed for his room.</p><br/><p>\u2666 \u2666 \u2666</p><br/><p>After Ainz\u2019s silhouette vanished up at the second floor, the buddies of the man which Ainz threw rushed up and began casting curative magic on him. Their actions seemed to be the spark which caused the silent tavern to burst into clamor.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026It seems he\u2019s as strong as he looks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s it. His arm strength is unbelievable, how did he train it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe must be pretty confident to carry no weapons besides those two greatswords.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit, another guy\u2019s going to leap ahead of us as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>The scattered conversations were filled with awe, surprise, and fear.</p><br/><p>They all knew that Ainz was not an ordinary person.</p><br/><p>The first reason for that was his impressive equipment. Full plate armor was hardly cheap, and one would need to have gone on many adventures \u2014 in other words, be an experienced adventurer \u2014 in order to purchase it. One would need to be at least a silver plate in order to accumulate enough capital for such a feat. However, some people inherited their suits from their predecessors, or found those suits on the battlefield or in ruins.</p><br/><p>That was why they wanted to take a measure of his ability.</p><br/><p>Everyone here was a comrade and a competitor at the same time. They all wanted to know the strength of any newcomers. The circumstances from just now had occurred in the past as well, over and over again.</p><br/><p>The truth was, everyone here had experienced this sort of thing in the past. However, none of them had passed the test so easily before. In other words, that pair of copper ranked adventurers\u2026</p><br/><p>They would be very strong, either as rivals or allies. Everyone here was fully convinced of that.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, how should we deal with those two?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFlirting with that beautiful woman is out of the question\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf only we could get them into our party\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must be mistaken, they should be in our party.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does he look like under that helmet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go listen on their wall tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t he mention the region\u2019s strongest man, Gazef Stronoff?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be that he\u2019s a disciple of the Warrior-Captain?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s certainly possible. Leave this task to a big-eared thief like me!\u201d</p><br/><p>As the crowd eagerly discussed the mysterious pair, the innkeeper walked up to one of the adventurers.</p><br/><p>She was holding the potion Ainz had given her just now.</p><br/><p>\u201cOi, Britta.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm? What?\u201d</p><br/><p>The woman \u2014 Britta \u2014 turned her eyes away from staring at the red potion and looked disinterestedly at the innkeeper.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of potion is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho knows?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Oi oi, you don\u2019t know either? You accepted his potion as compensation, shouldn\u2019t you know its value?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could I? Besides, I\u2019ve never seen a potion like this before. Gramps, you came here because you were curious too, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Britta was right.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes it cover the value of your potion that got smashed? This might end up being cheaper than the one you bought.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. It\u2019s definitely a gamble, but one I\u2019m confident of winning. This was something that guy in the flashy armor gave me after he heard the price of my potion.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I\u2019ve never seen a healing potion of this color before. It might be a rare treasure. If I delayed and he said he would pay in cash, I\u2019d be coming back from the dragon\u2019s den with nothing to show for it, right? In any case, I\u2019ll take it for appraisal tomorrow and find out how much it\u2019s worth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, in that case, I\u2019ll cover the appraisal fee for you. In fact, I\u2019ll even recommend a good place for you to visit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou will, gramps?\u201d</p><br/><p>Britta furrowed her brows. The innkeeper was a good man, but he was hardly a Good Samaritan either. He must have something in mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, don\u2019t look at me like that. I just want you to tell me the effects of this potion.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s a trade, then?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s a good trade, right? Besides, I can recommend a really good herbalist to you through my connections. I\u2019m talking about that Lizzie Bareare.\u201d</p><br/><p>Britta\u2019s eyes went wide with surprise.</p><br/><p>E-Rantel was a place with many mercenaries and adventurers. It specialized in selling weapons and other items to these people, and among them the trade in potions was quite brisk. Therefore, E-Rantel had more herbalists than a normal city.</p><br/><p>Amidst this fierce competition, Lizzie Bareare had earned fame as the best herbalist in the region. She could make the most complex potions of all the herbalists in the city. Since the innkeeper had mentioned her by name, Britta had no way of refusing his offer.</p><br/><p>Part 2</p><br/><p>The wooden door closed with a thud.</p><br/><p>The room was bare, apart from a pair of crudely-made bed frames with accompanying chests. After opening the windowblinds, they could directly feel the sunlight and outside air.</p><br/><p>Ainz was somewhat disappointed as he finished his circular sweep of the room. Although he could not expect Nazarick-level furnishings and cleanliness in a godforsaken place like this, he still wanted to get out of here.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe he would dare let you stay in a place like this, Momon-sama.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that, Nabe. Our aim is to become adventurers, and then increase our fame to the point where everyone knows of us. Until then, it won\u2019t hurt to experience the life of a newbie.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz tried to soothe Narberal after closing the window blinds, without expressing his own dissatisfaction. There was not enough sunlight coming in through the blinds to light up the entire room. Ainz and Nabe both possessed darkvision, so it was hardly an obstacle to them, but for a normal person, this room would be so dark that they would have trouble seeing.</p><br/><p>\u201cStill\u2026 the life of an adventurer is pretty banal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adventurers.</p><br/><p>Once, Ainz dreamed about that profession.</p><br/><p>He envisioned them as people who chased after the unknown and had adventures in various parts of the world. Ainz had previously thought that adventurers were a physical manifestation of the right way to play YGGDRASIL, but after listening to the Guild receptionist, he realised that adventuring was a more realistic and more boring job than he had expected.</p><br/><p>Simply put, adventurers were \u201canti-monster mercenaries.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although some parts of it fit his dreams of them \u2014 for instance, delving into the ruins of kingdoms destroyed by the Demon Gods two hundred years ago and investigating mysteries in uncharted lands \u2014 for the most part, they were simply monster hunters.</p><br/><p>Every monster possessed different special abilities, so they could only be taken care of by people who knew more tricks than average soldiers.</p><br/><p>Just going by that point, one might think that they were heroes who were loved and relied on by the common man, like in games.</p><br/><p>However, the reality was somewhat different from that.</p><br/><p>This was because the ruling authorities did not smile on the existence of armed groups which they could not control. Therefore, aside from the prices they commanded, adventurers did not have much status.</p><br/><p>Another reason why adventurers were not accepted on a national scale was because of the same thinking which made companies look for cheap, local temps than employing expensive permanent staff. Thus, much like how temps were treated by companies who could get by without hiring them, adventurers were held in lower regard in those nations which could eliminate monsters by dint of their own military power.</p><br/><p>According to the Guild receptionist, there were no adventurers in the Slaine Theocracy, while life had gotten worse for adventurers in the Baharuth Empire after the ascension of their new Emperor.</p><br/><p>Ainz banished his mild disappointment from his heart. It was a common thing in life to find that a job which one admired was hardly as glamorous in reality.</p><br/><p>With a brief wave of his hand, the black armor and the two greatswords on his back melted away into nothingness, and a skeleton bedecked in magic items was revealed.</p><br/><p>He wore a pair of black mirrorshades and a red targeting sight. The silver circlet on his head was set with amethysts and thorns grew from it, making it look like a rose vine.</p><br/><p>Then there were the long-sleeved shirt and slacks, made of a lustrous, gauzy black material. A black belt secured the pants around his waist.</p><br/><p>Ainz took off the sturdy gauntlets, and there were rings on all his bony fingers save the left ring finger.</p><br/><p>His half-boots were made of a reddish-brown leather, and they were embroidered with gold thread.</p><br/><p>A silver necklace with a lion-head pendant hung around his neck, and around it was a red cape.</p><br/><p>Magic items in YGGDRASIL were made by infusing an item skin with a data crystal, so it was quite difficult to coordinate their appearance. However, many players disliked wearing a clownsuit, so after a certain update, players were given several ways to change their equipment\u2019s appearance without changing their gear.</p><br/><p>(TL note: \u201dclownsuit\u201d is the MMO term for a visually mismatched set of equipment only worn for their stat boosts)</p><br/><p>The suit of finely articulated black plate armor, made by the \u300cCreate Greater Item\u300d spell, was one of those ways.</p><br/><p>Currently, Ainz was wearing Sure-Hit Glasses, a Crown of Mental Fortitude, Black Widow Spider Clothes, a Black Belt, the Jarngreipr from earlier, a Nemean Lion pendant, Haste Boots, among other items.</p><br/><p>In YGGDRASIL, trading in magic items was usually done in the form of data crystals. However, there were people who sold second-hand items in order to make even stronger ones. It was at this point that a problem arose \u2014 the names of magic items made by other people might include forbidden language, or it might insult someone. Sometimes, the GMs would ask the players in question to rename the items.</p><br/><p>In general, naming items was left to the fancy of the creator.</p><br/><p>As a result, items with weird names were not very popular on the market. Although cash items which could rename them were not expensive, very few people wanted to make that expenditure.</p><br/><p>Thus, every player racked their brains to give their items good names. Sometimes the names would be in English, or they would come from mythology.</p><br/><p>Of course, there were exceptions to this as well.</p><br/><p>For instance, naming rings was very troublesome, so most people tended to call them Ring1, Ring2, Ring3 and so on. Ainz had even seen someone who called them Thumb Ring, Index Finger Ring, Middle Finger Ring, and so on.</p><br/><p>Ainz had a friend called Warrior Takemikazuchi, who wielded two katanas from time to time. He named one of them \u2014 the eighth of its line \u2014 \u201cTakemikazuchi Mk 8.\u201d</p><br/><p>The red cape he was wearing had also been named along that line of thought.</p><br/><p>Inspired by an anti-hero from American comics, it was called the Necroplasmic Mantle.</p><br/><p>(TL Note: in other words, Spawn\u2019s cape)</p><br/><p>All of these were relic class items. They were two tiers lower than Ainz\u2019s main gear, but he had considered that problems might arise from bringing items which were too strong, so he settled for equipment of this level.</p><br/><p>Ainz worked his shoulders and savored the sensation of being free from his armor. Just then, Narberal asked a question:</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeaking of which, how shall we deal with that annoying woman?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, the one whose potion we broke? We don\u2019t need to split hairs with her. I\u2019d be angry as well if someone broke something important to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Or at least, until his emotion suppression kicked in. Ainz paused for a while, before continuing:</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Well, probably. It\u2019s only natural for her to scold me for my carelessness.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut all that was because a foolish human tried to provoke a Supreme Being. That man is the one who was to blame.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps, but I was the one who threw that man. Therefore, I hope that you will be big hearted and forgive her. What we should be doing in this city is becoming a part of this world, to increase the renown of Momon and Nabe. It would reflect badly on us if rumors spread that we could not even pay someone back the value of a single potion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Narberal nodded, although she could not quite accept what Ainz had said.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, we should give her some face, since she\u2019s technically our senior in this field.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz fiddled with the necklace he wore, though he kept his fingers away from the Nemean Lion.</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s just a simple metal plate, then it can be forged\u2026 although that should probably be something for the Guild to worry about.</p><br/><p>That small copper plate was something like a set of dog tags. It was what allowed people to know the strength of an adventurer.</p><br/><p>Copper. Iron. Silver. Gold. Platinum. Mithril. Orichalcum. Adamantite.</p><br/><p>The latter metals were more valuable, which meant that adventurers of those ranks could select more difficult and more rewarding quests. This was part of the system the Guild had developed to keep adventurers from going to pointless deaths.</p><br/><p>Ainz, a freshly-registered adventurer, was of the lowest class \u2014 copper. That woman was an iron plate. Showing her a basic level of courtesy was the secret of successfully blending into society.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, I feel that such soft metals like adamantite are not worthy of you, Ainz-sama. Apoitakara, hihiirokane, or other prismatic metals would be more fitting of yourself. These people in the Guild have no taste at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>The metals Narberal had named were of the highest tiers in YGGDRASIL. Ainz turned a sharp look on her, and then said:</p><br/><p>\u201cNarberal, just to be safe, call me Momon while we are in this town.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood, Momon-sama!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you need me to remind you again? Call me Momon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy, my deepest apologies, Momon-sa\u2014n.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Momon-sa\u2014n sounds kind of stupid, don\u2019t you think? Forget it, if it\u2019s hard for you to just call me Momon, then Momon-san will do. Got it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand, Momon-san.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once again, Narberal bowed deeply at the waist. Ainz tapped at his forehead with a finger.</p><br/><p>She has no idea why I want her to call me Momon-san. She\u2019s kind of useless\u2026 forget it, there\u2019s nobody else I can use for now, so I\u2019ll forgive her.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is our plan for the future\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Narberal promptly genuflected before Ainz. It was the attitude of a vassal awaiting orders.</p><br/><p>An annoyed Ainz had no idea how to proceed. Though he had locked the door after coming in, gossip would swiftly spread if people saw this scene.</p><br/><p>Still\u2026 why doesn\u2019t she understand the reason that I want her to call me Momon? I even explained it to her before coming to the inn\u2026</p><br/><p>With a tone of vague resignation, Ainz said:</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are here to go undercover as adventurers in this city. This is because we have to collect information on adventurers \u2014 in other words, the strongest people in this world \u2014 though our emphasis will be on learning about YGGDRASIL players, like myself. Attaining higher ranks will allow us to take higher ranked jobs, which will also allow us to collect more reliable and useful information. Therefore, our first objective is to become successful adventurers.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Narberal indicated that she understood, Ainz told her about the things she had to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, there are several problems at the moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz withdrew his small purse and opened it, then dumped its contents onto his hand. They were coins, and there were very few of them. There was no glint of gold among the coin.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo begin with, we have no money.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were several reasons why Ainz had paid with a potion during the prior dispute. One of them was because he was not confident they could solve this problem with money. Saying that he had no money to pay would be laughable.</p><br/><p>Ainz turned to the surprised Narberal, and explained:</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I should say that we do have a lot of money, but the currency we have is largely YGGDRASIL gold coins. Therefore, I would like to use those gold coins as a last resort.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is that? Haven\u2019t we already confirmed that YGGDRASIL coins have monetary value?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed, I learned from Carne Village that each YGGDRASIL gold coin is worth two of the local gold coins. However, if we use YGGDRASIL gold coins here, there\u2019s no telling where they\u2019ll end up. If things go bad, the news might spread beyond to others, and it\u2019ll be a blatant advertisement to other YGGDRASIL players that we\u2019re here. Therefore, we have to avoid that situation as long as we do not fully understand the situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlayers\u2026 entities on the same level as yourself, Ainz-sama, and the villains who once attacked Nazarick.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz frowned as she referred to him as Ainz-sama, but he did not say anything, for the same reasons as just now.</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed. They are people that cannot be taken lightly.\u201d</p><br/><p>His \u2014 Ainz Ooal Gown\u2019s \u2014 level was the highest in YGGDRASIL, level one hundred. However, to players, being maximum level was hardly a rare thing. It could be said that most players were level one hundred.</p><br/><p>Ainz considered himself to be among the upper-middle tier of the game\u2019s players. This was because he was focused on taking levels in classes to better roleplay an undead magic caster, and neglected raising his own power. However, given the divine class items he possessed, as well as his numerous cash items, he might be ranked in the middle of the top tier. Still, he could not take things easy. There was always a bigger fish, after all.</p><br/><p>Thus, he had to avoid being found by other players, at any cost. There were many opponents Ainz could not defeat if he was drawn into battle.</p><br/><p>In addition, there were many players who were human, and they would naturally protect other humans. If these players clashed with people like Albedo, who viewed humans as inferior lifeforms, the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick \u2014 or Ainz Ooal Gown \u2014 might very well count humanity as enemies. That was why he felt bringing Albedo along was dangerous.</p><br/><p>Still, I didn\u2019t expect Narberal to feel the same way as well.</p><br/><p>Ainz did not view humanity as an enemy, but he could kill human beings with no hesitation for the sake of his goals. Even so, he wanted to avoid conflict with other players.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, that was a waste.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat was a waste?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking about how we lost Nigun so easily. He had a lot of information, but he perished under such simple questioning.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were roughly ten people still alive from the members of the Sunlight Scripture captured at Carne Village. The rest died during questioning and became media for Ainz to summon undead with his skills.</p><br/><p>As he recalled the information tortured out of his captives, Ainz could not help but mutter:</p><br/><p>\u201cMost players would want to support the Slaine Theocracy\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The Slaine Theocracy was a religious nation which venerated the Six Gods, who descended upon the world six hundred years ago.</p><br/><p>In the words of the Sunlight Scripture, the Slaine Theocracy fought to allow the weak human race to prosper, grow strong, and defeat other species. Any player with any remaining humanity would approve of the Slaine Theocracy\u2019s aims.</p><br/><p>Unlike his own world, where humanity stood atop all living creatures, in this world, humanity was one of the weakest species around.</p><br/><p>Though they could build such an impressive city upon the plains, the fact that they had to live on the plains only highlighted humanity\u2019s weakness.</p><br/><p>That said, plains were also dangerous places. Firstly, there was no place to hide, so it was easy to be discovered by the enemy. Only weak species, who lacked darkvision, would choose to live in a place like this. They would have no safe spaces or living room if they chose otherwise.</p><br/><p>There were species who were physically stronger and possessed more advanced civilizations than humans, but they were not in control of the continent. This was because they had ended up fighting the Eight Greed Kings, who dominated this land five hundred years ago. Humanity was one of the few survivors of that war. If not, the human race would long since be extinct.</p><br/><p>Any players in this world would want to help out humanity. That was why Ainz was on guard against players and kept his distance from the Slaine Theocracy.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn any case, I plan to sell off the swords taken from the Slaine Theocracy troops pretending to be knights\u2026 but before that, we need to get a job.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood. Then, shall we visit the guild again tomorrow?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed. Although I\u2019d like to learn more by walking around this city, we should leave that for after we\u2019ve earned some money.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. As a battle maid, I shall carry out your orders with all my strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so. Then, I\u2019ll be counting on you, Narberal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz felt a warm glow of satisfaction as he watched Narberal bowing deeply. Then he cast a spell, and was wrapped in his armor and illusion once more.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will be inspecting our surroundings. You will stay here and wait for orders.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease allow me to come with you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m only looking around the neighborhood. I\u2019ve heard of a large graveyard which I want to visit\u2026 and the other reason why you\u2019re staying here is to ward off intruders. You must stay on your guard and never slack off. While I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any vulnerabilities in our defenses for the moment, this place might well be considered enemy territory, so you must never relax.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave the scheduled call-ins to you as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2666 \u2666 \u2666</p><br/><p>As Ainz left the room, Narberal sighed deeply.</p><br/><p>Then she rubbed the corner of her eyes, and her eyes, previously filled with a keen expression, drooped powerlessly. Her face looked completely relaxed. Even her ponytail seemed to have lost its energy and hung limply down.</p><br/><p>However, she still recalled her supreme master\u2019s orders.</p><br/><p>Though Narberal was dying to look around outside the room, she was a magic caster and had a lot of trouble replicating the feats of thieves. Therefore, she used the skills she was familiar with to make up the shortfall.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u300cRabbit\u2019s Ear\u300d.\u201d</p><br/><p>A pair of adorable bunny ears grew from Narberal\u2019s head as the spell was cast. The quivering ears immediately picked up all the sounds around her.</p><br/><p>This was one of the three spells known as \u201cBunny Magic\u201d to the players of YGGDRASIL. The other two were \u300cRabbit\u2019s Foot\u300d, which boosted luck, and \u300cBunny Tail\u300d, which reduced monster aggro. Casting all three of these spells at once would change the appearance of a female character\u2019s clothing, and so they were very popular. However, Narberal did not cast the other two because they were not needed.</p><br/><p>Most of Narberal\u2019s spells pertained to combat. This was one of the few exceptions.</p><br/><p>After listening to the sounds around her, she made sure it was safe before casting the \u300cMessage\u300d spell. As she expected, a pleasant female voice spoke within her head.</p><br/><p>\u300eNarberal Gamma, is something the matter?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, this is the scheduled report.\u201d</p><br/><p>Narberal was speaking to the Guardian Overseer of the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick, Albedo.</p><br/><p>She described every detail of the situation to Albedo, and finally she mentioned the news that Albedo was dying to hear:</p><br/><p>\u201cAinz-sama mentioned you, Albedo-sama. He said that there was nobody else he could trust apart from you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300eKufu\u2014!\u300f</p><br/><p>A strange cry of delight resounded within Narberal\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u300eGood \u2014 very good \u2014 Narberal, you\u2019re a good girl! Keep spreading that news for me! This is an order from Nazarick\u2019s Guardian Overseer!\u300f</p><br/><p>Narberal wondered, Is this really worth an order? However, she realized that this might be a move in the struggle to better serve the Supreme One. Thus, such an order made perfect sense.</p><br/><p>Just as Narberal was about to express her doubts, she heard Albedo\u2019s excited voice once more.</p><br/><p>\u300eI\u2019ll slowly decrease the distance between myself and Ainz-sama while Shalltear is out on business! Although the objective is hard to breach, as long as I keep up the pressure and gain a beachhead, I\u2019ll be able to bring it down one day! On that glorious day, Shalltear will weep bitter tears of regret!\u300f</p><br/><p>Albedo\u2019s cry of delight made Narberal furrow her brows. That excited voice was starting to annoy her.</p><br/><p>With a voice that suggested she might burst into dance at any moment, Albedo continued babbling about what she would do next, and how things had to be, and then suddenly, she asked in a calm voice:</p><br/><p>\u300eStill, why are you helping me? Why did you choose me and not Shalltear? Could it be that you want something from me?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201cThe answer is simple. If someone asked me whether Albedo-sama or Shalltear-sama was more suitable to sit beside Ainz-sama, I would definitely answer with your name, Albedo-sama.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300eKufu\u2014! Wonderful. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be able to see the future of Nazarick. I\u2019m impressed.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, Yuri-neesama has a hard time dealing with Shalltear-sama.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300eOh, Yuri Alpha. I see, so that\u2019s how it is. Are the others on my side as well?\u300f</p><br/><p>The faces of the assistant leader Yuri Alpha as well as her other comrades appeared in Narberal\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is hard to tell. Lupusregina is with you, Albedo-sama, but Solution is on Shalltear-sama\u2019s side. As for Entoma and Shizu, their allegiances are not yet known.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300eCan Solution be won over?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201cIt would be very difficult, because her tastes are very similar to Shalltear-sama\u2019s.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300eOh, I see\u2026 what crude hobbies she has.\u300f</p><br/><p>Narberal agreed with Albedo\u2019s words. She had no idea why Solution liked what she did, and she could not help but tilt her head in puzzlement.</p><br/><p>Although all human beings were inferior lifeforms \u2014 with one exception \u2014 none of them had the hobby of tormenting humans. However, they would kill any humans who got in their way, even if doing so was tedious. That said, they would not go out of their way to kill them.</p><br/><p>\u300eWell, it can\u2019t be helped. Then, move quickly and bring the other girls into my camp. Start with Entoma and Shizu.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201cThat should be fine. Solution and Entoma both like eating humans, so if we bring Entoma to your side, Solution might end up becoming an ally as a result.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300eThat\u2019s right\u2026 I\u2019ve got it. Then, onto something else\u2026 can you tell me in detail what my beloved Ainz-sama has been doing?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>The scheduled communication with Albedo ended up being very heated \u2014 when Albedo heard Narberal and Ainz were sharing a room, she made strange noises and kicked up a fuss \u2014 to the point where she had to cast the same spell four times. Ainz was mildly annoyed when he returned, but that is a tale for another time.</p><br/><p>Part 3</p><br/><p>Sensing something like a color upon the wind, Britta sniffed several times, like a dog.</p><br/><p>She was not mistaken \u2014 the air contained a greenish scent. This odor came from mysterious drugs and crushed plants. The smell told Britta that she was at her destination.</p><br/><p>Britta continued forward, to a place where the smell was stronger than just now. Peering left and right, she walked on until she was in front of the largest house.</p><br/><p>This house was different from the others around it, which were designed with a shop area in front and a work area in the back. It seemed to have been built from the ground up as a workshop.</p><br/><p>She knew that she had arrived from the sign that hung above the door and outside the place.</p><br/><p>The bell mounted on top of the door rang surprisingly loudly as she pushed open the front door.</p><br/><p>After she entered, she found herself in something that looked like a guest lounge. There were two facing benches in the middle of the room, cabinets of books on the walls, and ornamental plants in the corners of the room.</p><br/><p>As she stepped into the lounge, a voice called out:</p><br/><p>\u201cWelcome!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a male voice, though it sounded too young to belong to a man.</p><br/><p>Looking around, she saw a teenage boy standing before her, dressed in a beat-up set of old work coveralls that were stained with juices from crushed plants.</p><br/><p>His blond hair covered half his face, so it was hard to guess his age, but from his height and his voice, he should be in puberty.</p><br/><p>Although he was a teenager, Britta could still guess his name. Apart from the fame of his grandmother, he had become one of the few notable people in E-Rantel by virtue of his innate talents.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Nfirea Bareare-san?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The boy \u2014 Nfirea \u2014 nodded and asked:</p><br/><p>\u201cMay I know what business you have here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, yes. Hang on a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Britta retrieved the folded slip of paper the innkeeper had passed her and gave it to the boy.</p><br/><p>Upon receiving the piece of paper, Nfirea opened and read it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see\u2026 so that\u2019s what\u2019s going on. Then, can I see the potion?\u201d</p><br/><p>Britta took out the potion and handed it to Nfirea, who brought it so close to himself that his hair covered it.</p><br/><p>The atmosphere changed.</p><br/><p>Nfirea swept his hair away, revealing a handsome face, which would surely break the hearts of many girls.</p><br/><p>However, within that youthful face of his was a pair of steely eyes. It was hard to imagine that someone who spoke and acted like he did could have eyes like that. Those eyes sparkled with excitement. Nfirea shook the potion bottle several times and nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cForgive me, it\u2019s not convenient to speak here. Could you follow me inside?\u201d</p><br/><p>Britta agreed, and under Nfirea\u2019s guidance, she soon arrived at a messy room. Still, she thought that way because she lacked professional experience.</p><br/><p>On the table were round-bottomed flasks, test tubes, distillation equipment, mortars, funnels, beakers, alcohol lamps, balances, a bizarre-looking pot, and various other items. The shelves on the walls were filled with mysterious herb and mineral samples.</p><br/><p>An acrid odor hung in the air. It seemed potentially dangerous to one\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>The person who was already within the room stared at the two people who had barged in.</p><br/><p>She was a very old woman, and both her face and hands were heavily wrinkled. Her hair, which reached to her eyebrows, was pure white. Her work clothes were stained with even more green residue than Nfirea\u2019s and she smelled heavily of grass.</p><br/><p>Nfirea, who had just entered, called out to the old lady:</p><br/><p>\u201cGranny!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it, what is it, I can hear you even if you don\u2019t shout. My ears are sharp, you know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nfirea only had one grandmother, who was renowned as the greatest herbalist in this city, Lizzie Bareare.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome take a look at this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lizzie accepted the potion Nfirea offered her. As she studied it, her gaze was so focused and keen that it unsettled Britta. She looked like a grizzled veteran of many battles.</p><br/><p>In this, she was not wrong. Herbalists needed to use magic when making their potions and medicines, and the more famous the herbalist, the higher the tier of magic they could use. Therefore, the greatest herbalist of E-Rantel, Lizzie Bareare, was a much better combatant than Britta.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis potion\u2026 did you bring it here? \u2026A legendary potion? No, could it be\u2026 God\u2019s Blood? What on earth is this potion?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Britta\u2019s eyes went wide, thinking That\u2019s my line.</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible\u2026 this potion. Where did you get it from? A ruin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Ah, no, that\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a shrinking violet you are. Just give me a straight answer \u2014 where did you get it from? Did you steal it? Hm?\u201d</p><br/><p>Britta\u2019s shoulders shuddered in surprise. She had done nothing wrong, yet she felt like she was being rebuked.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Granny, don\u2019t scare her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What are you saying, Nfirea? I didn\u2019t scare her at all\u2026 right?\u201d</p><br/><p>No, you did. Britta wanted to say that, but instead she gulped and simply told Lizzie the full story about the potion:</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, er, someone else gave it to me as payment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Hah?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lizzie\u2019s eyes became even more stern.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute, Granny. Britta-san, could you tell me who gave it to you? And why was it given to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>With Nfirea\u2019s help, Britta explained simply that she had received the potion from a mysterious man in full plate. As Lizzie heard it, more furrows sprouted on her wrinkled face.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Did you know that there are three kinds of potions?\u201d</p><br/><p>Without waiting for Britta\u2019s reply, Lizzie continued:</p><br/><p>\u201cThe first kind are potions made from herbs alone. Those potions act slowly, and all they can do is improve a person\u2019s natural recovery. While they\u2019re not very effective, they\u2019re very cheap. The second kind of potions are made with herbs and magic. These potions take effect faster than the first kind, but they still need some time to work. Most adventurers use these potions to recover after a battle. The final kind of potion is made solely from magic. Essentially, one infuses a spell into an alchemical solution and it takes instant effect. These potions are functionally the same as a spell, but they are correspondingly more expensive. Then, which of these three kinds does that potion of yours belong too? I can\u2019t see any traces of herbal residue, so it should be a pure-magic potion, but\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>Lizzie pulled out a potion bottle filled with a blue liquid and held it before Britta\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a basic healing potion. The colors are different, right? Recovery potions turn blue during their manufacture, but yours is red. In other words, the process by which that potion was made is completely different from the way normal potions are made. In other words, your potion is pretty rare, and for all we know it might end up revolutionizing modern potion creation methods\u2026 well, you might not realise it for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, Lizzie cast a spell:</p><br/><p>\u201c\u300cAppraisal Magic Item\u300d.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u300cDetect Enchant\u300d.\u201d</p><br/><p>After casting the two spells on the potion, a look of shock and anger appeared on Lizzie\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuku. Fuahaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014Suddenly, crazed laughter echoed through the narrow room. Lizzie slowly raised her head, a terrifyingly mad smile on her face. Britta was so frightened by the sudden change in Lizzie that not only could she not speak, she could not even move.</p><br/><p>\u201cKukuku! Is that what it is!? Look closely at this potion, Nfirea! This is the perfected form of all potions! It\u2019s right here! We \u2014 herbalists, alchemists, everyone in the business of making potions \u2014 have studied for so long and accumulated so much experience, but yet we have not been able to achieve this idealized form!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lizzie\u2019s cheeks were red from her excitement and she was huffing and puffing. However, she maintained her death grip on the potion bottle as she brought it before Nfirea\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cPotions will deteriorate over time, am I right!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, that\u2019s common sense.\u201d</p><br/><p>In stark contrast to Lizzie\u2019s excitement, Nfirea was calm. However, Britta could sense hints of anticipation within him.</p><br/><p>She had no idea why they were so fired up about this. She keenly felt like she had been swept up into a storm that shook the heavens and the earth. To think she had brought a potion here that could put such an excited look on the face of E-Rantel\u2019s greatest herbalist!</p><br/><p>\u201cPure magic potions are made from alchemical solutions. Those solutions are refined from a mineral base, so it\u2019s only natural that the quality of the solution will degrade over time. That\u2019s why you need to cast the spell \u300cPreservation\u300d on it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lizzie paused, and then spoke again.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt least, until now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Britta seemed to understand a little of what Lizzie was saying. She looked at the red solution, her eyes wide with surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis bottle! This potion! This bottle of potion! It doesn\u2019t deteriorate even without preservative magic! In other words, it\u2019s a perfect potion! Nobody\u2019s done anything like this until today! According to the ancient legends, the original healing potion was made from the blood of the gods.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lizzie shook the bottle she was holding and the bright red liquid swirled within the glass.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, they\u2019re just legends. It used to be a joke between herbalists that the gods had blue blood.\u201d</p><br/><p>After another brief pause, Lizzie looked at the bottle of potion she was holding in her hand. It was trembling in her excitement.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis potion might well be the true God\u2019s Blood!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nfirea kept patting Lizzie\u2019s back as she panted heavily. Britta was struck dumb by surprise. The silence between them was broken by Lizzie:</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026You must have come here to learn about this potion\u2019s effects, right? This potion is around the level of a second tier healing spell. Not counting the added value from its rarity, it would fetch around eight gold pieces. That said, once you factor that extra value in, the price is enough that people would murder you for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Britta\u2019s body trembled uncontrollably.</p><br/><p>To an iron plate adventurer like Britta, the potion\u2019s base value alone was already very high, to say nothing of the added value. Lizzie had a gleaming edge in her eye, and she looked like she was looking for any opportunity to take it from her.</p><br/><p>Even so, Britta had her doubts. Why would that man in full plate armor give her that potion so easily? What sort of man hid under that armor?</p><br/><p>Just as countless doubts appeared in her heart, Lizzie asked:</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about selling it to me? I\u2019ll give you a good price for it. How about thirty two gold pieces?\u201d</p><br/><p>Britta\u2019s eyes went even wider.</p><br/><p>The price Lizzie had just quoted was a staggering sum. Frugally used, it was enough for a family of three to live on for three years.</p><br/><p>Britta was confused. She knew the potion was incredibly valuable. Then, was selling it for thirty two gold pieces the right thing to do? It seemed unlikely that she would ever be able to lay her hands on another potion like this again.</p><br/><p>But if she refused, would she make it back alive?</p><br/><p>After seeing Britta\u2019s hesitant face, Lizzie shook her head and proposed another deal\u2014</p><br/><p>Part 4</p><br/><p>The next morning, Ainz \u2014 also known as Momon \u2014 opened the guild\u2019s doors once more.</p><br/><p>The first thing he saw as he entered the room was the counter, where three of the guild\u2019s receptionists greeted the adventurers with smiles on their faces. There were warriors in full plate armor, nimble fellows in light armor and bearing bows, people in priest\u2019s garb and adorned with all manner of holy symbols, as well as robed arcane magic casters with their staves.</p><br/><p>On the left was a large door, and on the right was a notice board. There were several pieces of parchment upon it which he had not seen yesterday. Several adventurers were chatting in front of it.</p><br/><p>Annoyed by that sight and the many sticking-out pieces of parchment, Ainz moved forward to the counter.</p><br/><p>The eyes of everyone present focused on the copper plate around Ainz\u2019s neck, and he could feel those eyes sizing him up from head to toe. It was just like yesterday at the inn.</p><br/><p>Ainz was surveying the adventurers in turn. They wore gold and silver plates on their necklaces, with no copper plates. Feeling vaguely out of place, Ainz advanced to the counter.</p><br/><p>A group of adventurers had just departed, freeing up one of the counters. He stepped forward and said:</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon me, but I\u2019m looking for work.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, please select a piece of parchment from over there and bring it here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz nodded in silence, feeling as though his nonexistent sweat glands were now recovering some of their function. He arrived before the notice boards, looked across all of them, and then nodded.</p><br/><p>Yup, I can\u2019t read any of them.</p><br/><p>One of the laws in this world was that spoken language was automatically translated, but written text was not.</p><br/><p>The receptionists walked him through everything the last time he came to the Adventurer\u2019s Guild, so he had assumed they would do the same this time too. How naive.</p><br/><p>He wanted to scream \u201cAhhhh,\u201d and roll around on the ground, and then his emotions suddenly calmed down. Grateful for this property of his new body, Ainz frantically racked his brains.</p><br/><p>While the literacy rate here was not high, it would be shameful if his inability to read was discovered by others. They might even look down on him.</p><br/><p>The translation item that Ainz possessed was now in the hands of Sebas. During YGGDRASIL he had ignored spells of that sort and had not learned them. After all, he had scrolls, which could substitute for learning those spells.</p><br/><p>He cursed himself for a fool, for coming out without making preparations despite knowing that he could not read the language.</p><br/><p>Still, there was no point crying over spilt milk. Regret would not help him here.</p><br/><p>Narberal could not read the words either, so was of no use.</p><br/><p>Negative thoughts rose up in his mind, but as the ruler of Nazarick, he could not do anything embarrassing.</p><br/><p>After gathering his resolve, Ainz ripped off a piece of parchment, and strode back to the counter.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to take this job.\u201d</p><br/><p>Confusion came over the counter girl\u2019s face as she looked at the parchment before her eyes. Then, she smiled bitterly and replied:</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m very sorry, but this job is only for mithril plate adventurers\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know. That\u2019s why I took it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The calm, unwavering tone in Ainz\u2019s voice evoked doubt in the counter girl\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cEr, about that\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI would like to take this job.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Ah, but, even if you ask, according to the rules\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re worthless rules. I\u2019m fed up with having to keep proving myself with easy, pathetic jobs like this before my rank-up examinations.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you fail the job, many people will lose their lives.\u201d</p><br/><p>The receptionist\u2019s firm voice seemed to encompass the silent opinions of the countless people who had worked hard to qualify themselves by the guild\u2019s rankings.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz\u2019s snort drew hostility from the counter girl and the surrounding adventurers. Ainz felt that their attitude was only to be expected. After all, he was a clueless newcomer who was sneering at the rules by which they abided.</p><br/><p>As an undead being, Ainz felt nothing, but the remnants of Suzuki Satoru\u2019s salaryman sensibilities made Ainz want to apologize to everyone around him.</p><br/><p>Suzuki Satoru hated those people who rejected other\u2019s opinions without offering solutions of their own, and crappy customers who knew nothing.</p><br/><p>Right now, Ainz was part of the latter group, and he wanted to give himself a good punch.</p><br/><p>However, Ainz could not back down easily. He wanted to, but he could still deal with a situation of this level. Therefore, Ainz pulled out his trump card.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe person behind me is my companion, Nabe. She is a magician of the third tier.\u201d</p><br/><p>The air shuddered with a collective gasp, and everyone looked at Narberal in surprise. In this world, third tier spells were the highest which most magic casters could reach.</p><br/><p>Is he for real? The eyes of the surrounding people shifted to Ainz\u2019s stylish full plate armor, dubious of his claim.</p><br/><p>Adventurers wore equipment which matched their abilities. The stronger they were, the better the gear they outfitted themselves with. Ainz\u2019s armor was very eye-catching and he travelled with a woman like Nabe, both of which were very persuasive.</p><br/><p>Noticing the changes around him, Ainz cheered inside his heart, and decided to strike while the iron was hot:</p><br/><p>\u201cI, personally, am a warrior of comparable strength to Nabe. I am very sure that a job like that would be a trivial task for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The receptionist and the other adventurers were not as surprised in comparison to just now. They seemed to be looking at Ainz with different eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe did not become adventurers to do jobs for a few pieces of copper. I wish to take on a higher ranked job. If you wish to see our strength, I will be more than glad to show it to you. Therefore, can we take this job?\u201d</p><br/><p>The hostility towards them was fading rapidly, and there were whispers of, \u201cIndeed, that\u2019s right,\u201d and \u201cNo wonder.\u201d After all, the rough men called adventurers valued strength, and they understood what Ainz was trying to say.</p><br/><p>However, the counter girl was a different matter.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I am very sorry, but we cannot let you take this job due to the rules.\u201d</p><br/><p>The receptionist lowered her head in apology, and Ainz took a victory pose in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen it can\u2019t be helped\u2026 it seems I\u2019ve put you in a difficult position,\u201d Ainz replied as he nodded in apology.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, help me pick the most challenging copper plate job, then. There should be others besides the ones on the noticeboard, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, there are, I know.\u201d</p><br/><p>The receptionist stood up, and just as Ainz was about to cry tears of joy at his absolute victory, a man\u2019s voice reached his ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about helping us with our work, then?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>He had reflexively responded in a low, threatening tone. Ainz looked over, but all saw was a four-man adventurer team, their silver plates glittering on their necklaces.</p><br/><p>Ainz grumbled internally \u2014 After all the effort to misdirect them \u2014 and turned to face those people.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe job in question\u2026 it\u2019s a worthwhile assignment\u2026 right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm \u2014 well, I feel it\u2019s worthwhile.\u201d</p><br/><p>The person who responded was a man who looked like the team\u2019s leader. He wore some sort of banded armor \u2014 strips of metal woven together with metal threads over a leather or chain backing \u2014 and carried himself like a warrior.</p><br/><p>Should he join this man\u2019s team and work with them? Of course, he could decide after hearing them out, but then there was no telling if the receptionist girl would help them pick a job after he spoke with them. However, if he took their job, there would be a chance to build relations with them and obtain useful information.</p><br/><p>Several seconds passed.</p><br/><p>Ainz slowly nodded:</p><br/><p>\u201cWorthwhile jobs are exactly what I seek. Then, let us work together. However, I would like to ask what sort of job it is.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing his response, the men asked the receptionist to prepare a room for them.</p><br/><p>It looked like a meeting room, with a wooden table lined with chairs in the middle. The men streamed in and sat down.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease have a seat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz did as he was told, and Narberal silently took a place beside him.</p><br/><p>The men were all quite young, probably under twenty, but there was no childishness in them and they possessed a maturity which did not match their ages. Although they seemed to have seated themselves randomly around the table, judging by their distance and positioning, they could draw their weapons at any time.</p><br/><p>This unconscious display must have been a habit born from countless close encounters with death.</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore we begin discussing the job, let us introduce ourselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>The speaker was the man who looked like a warrior.</p><br/><p>He had the typical blond hair and blue eyes of the Kingdom, and while there were no other distinguishing features on him, he looked quite handsome.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m the leader of the \u201cSwords of Darkness,\u201d Peter Mauk. That fellow over there is the eyes and ears of our team, the ranger Lukrut Volve.\u201d</p><br/><p>A leather-armored blond man nodded in acknowledgement, and his brown eyes seemed to have a spark of delight in them. He was slender and long-limbed, kind of like a spider, but his lean torso was wiry and muscular.</p><br/><p>\u201cNext is our magic caster and the brains of our group, Ninya, The Spellcaster.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPleased to meet you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was probably the youngest person in the group, with dark brown hair and blue eyes. Though he was an adult, the smile on his face looked too youthful.</p><br/><p>Unlike the tanned skin of the group\u2019s other members, his skin was pale, and his face was the prettiest of the group\u2019s. It was more of an androgynous beauty than any masculine concept of attractiveness. His voice was higher-pitched than the others.</p><br/><p>However, the smile on his face was like a mask, though it was not entirely fake.</p><br/><p>While the others all wore armor, he wore a leather robe. However, Ainz could see that beneath the table he had various strange items in his belt, including oddly-shaped bottles and peculiar wooden objects and so on.</p><br/><p>Judging from the term \u201cspellcaster,\u201d he was probably a magic caster of the arcane variety, like Ainz.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026But Peter, can you not use that embarrassing nickname?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? But it\u2019s a good one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have a nickname?\u201d Ainz asked, with no idea what was going on. Lukrut explained:</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a talent holder, and a genius magic caster.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Ainz murmured: they had tortured three of the Sunlight Scripture members to death to get that information, and now there was a live example in front of him. Ainz was delighted.</p><br/><p>However, Narberal did not understand and simply snorted derisively. Ainz sighed in relief after he realized that none of them had heard it. He was slightly mad because his incompetent subordinate was doing odd things like this during a negotiation, but getting into an argument here would not be productive either, so Ainz quickly calmed himself down.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing much, it\u2019s just that I happened to have a talent pertaining to that field\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz was even more interested, and he leaned forward, straining to listen.</p><br/><p>Much like martial arts, talents were abilities that did not exist in YGGDRASIL but which were unique to this world. About one in every two hundred people was born with a talent. While talent-holders were not rare, the abilities themselves varied greatly in potency and type.</p><br/><p>For instance, there were talents like being able to predict tomorrow\u2019s weather with seventy percent accuracy, the ability to strengthen summoned monsters, hastening the harvest by several days, using the magic of the dragons which once ruled this world, and so on.</p><br/><p>However, all of these were inborn abilities, which could not be chosen or changed. It was quite common to encounter situations where these abilities could not be applied. If someone was born with a talent that could improve the destructive power of their magic, but they never had the chance to become a magic caster, then their talent would be useless.</p><br/><p>There were very few people who could make good use of their talents. There were almost no talents which could dictate the course of one\u2019s entire life, apart from a few exceptionally powerful talents..</p><br/><p>The best proof of that statement was Gazef Stronoff, who was a warrior without a talent.</p><br/><p>However, people with combat-applicable talents tended to go into the adventuring profession. Therefore, talent-holders were a common sight among adventurers. The person before him was one of those lucky few who could fully utilize his talent.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think his talent had something to do with being suited to studying magic, and he only took four years to learn what should have taken eight years. I\u2019m not a magic caster, so I\u2019m not sure how great that is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz was a magic caster as well. Those words made him curious, and awoke a collector\u2019s desire within him. This was an ability which the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick did not possess, and which could strengthen the organization. If he could gain control of that ability, it might be worth making enemies of everyone here.</p><br/><p>Shrinking the time it took to learn an ability like this should have been the province of a Super tier spell,\u300cWish Upon A Star\u300d.</p><br/><p>The two of them continued talking, without realizing that Ainz was watching them under his helmet, like a tiger ready to pounce on its prey.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I\u2019m really lucky that I was born with this ability, because it allowed me to take a step closer to my dream. Without this power, I would have ended my days as a lowly peasant.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ninya\u2019s muttering was gloomy and solemn. As though to sweep away the grim air hanging over the room, Peter continued in a completely different tone:</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, no matter what, you\u2019re still a famous talent-holder in this city.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStill, there\u2019s people more famous than me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe leader of Blue Rose?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat person\u2019s famous too, but I was talking about someone within this city.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean, Bareare-shi!?\u201d shouted the last person, who had not yet been introduced yet. Ainz was curious about the name and asked:</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026And what sort of talent does that person have?\u201d</p><br/><p>A look of surprise came over all four of them. It would seem this was common knowledge.</p><br/><p>Ainz had asked that question because he was curious and wanted to acquire an ability which could strengthen Nazarick. Therefore, in response to the regret he felt over his carelessness, he told himself that there had to be some way to recover from a mistake like this.</p><br/><p>However, before Ainz could explain, the other side came to a conclusion of their own:</p><br/><p>\u201cI see, the reason why we don\u2019t know you at all despite that stylish full plate and your beautiful companion is because you\u2019re not from around here, am I right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz nodded at this heaven-sent mercy of a question.</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed, that is correct. The truth is, we only arrived here yesterday.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, so you wouldn\u2019t know, then? He\u2019s a famous person in this town, but he\u2019s probably not that famous that distant cities would know about him, huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ve never heard of him before. If you don\u2019t mind, could you tell me about him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHis name is Nfirea Bareare, the grandson of a famous herbalist. His talent allows him to use any magic item. Not only can he use scrolls of a different spellcasting system from himself, he can even use items made by the non-human races. Even items restricted to those of royal blood shouldn\u2019t be a problem either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c..Oh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz tried his best not to let them hear the awe in his voice.</p><br/><p>How much could his talent do? Could he use the Staff of Ainz Ooal Gown \u2014 which only the guildmaster could use \u2014 as well as World Class Items? Or did it have limits?</p><br/><p>He was someone to be wary of, but he could be very useful as well.</p><br/><p>Narberal seemed to feel the same way. She brought her mouth close to where Ainz\u2019s ears would be under the helmet and whispered:</p><br/><p>\u201cI think that person is dangerous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I know. Coming to this city was the right decision.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMomon-san, is something the matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, no, it\u2019s fine, don\u2019t worry. Speaking of which, could you tell me about your last friend?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. He\u2019s a druid \u2014 Dyne Woodwonder. He uses healing spells and magic that controls nature, and he\u2019s well versed in herbal lore. Let him know if there\u2019s anything wrong with your body; he has medicine that\u2019s good for stomach pains.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPleased to meet you!\u201d came the greeting from the burly, barbaric-looking man with a full, bushy beard. However, he seemed younger than how Ainz appeared.</p><br/><p>There was a very faint smell of grass from him, which came from the cloth pouch tied to his waist.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, it\u2019s time for us to introduce ourselves. She is Nabe, I am Momon. Pleased to meet you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPleased to meet you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWonderful, I hope we\u2019ll get along. Then, Momon-san, just address me by my first name. Right, while it feels a little wrong to get to business so abruptly, we should probably start discussing the job. As for that, the truth is what we\u2019re asking you for doesn\u2019t really qualify as work.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat means\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing Ainz\u2019s confusion, Peter extended his hand to halt him, with the intention of delaying the question for a later date.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis job is to hunt the monsters that appear around the town.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cClearing out monsters, huh\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>That was enough to count as work. Or was there some special adventurer reason which made him say that it did not qualify? Ainz wanted to ask about that, but if this was common knowledge, asking that question might make him appear clueless, which was bad. Therefore, he tried asking a safe question instead.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat sorts of monsters will we be exterminating?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, we\u2019re not exterminating monsters. After hunting monsters, the city council will pay us a reward based on their strength. What do they call it where you come from, Momon-san?\u201d</p><br/><p>So that was it.</p><br/><p>Ainz understood. When Peter said that this did not qualify as work, in YGGDRASIL terms, it was more like killing spawned monsters and taking the items they dropped.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is something we have to do to make a living,\u201d said the druid \u2014 Dyne Woodwonder \u2014 in his deep baritone.</p><br/><p>Following that, Lukrut spoke up as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor us, it\u2019s making a living, but what we do also reduces the danger to the surrounding people. The traders can come and go in peace and the country can collect its taxes. All in all, it\u2019s a way to earn money without anyone losing out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNowadays, most countries with guilds do this, but five years ago, this sort of thing was nonexistent. It\u2019s quite surprising.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone in the team nodded as Ninya spoke. They began chatting amongst themselves, leaving no openings for Ainz to cut in. Still, it would be odd to know absolutely nothing about this country, so Ainz decided to shut up and listen to what they said.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all thanks to the Golden Princess, long may she live.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe proposed a policy through that would waive taxes on adventurers, although it never got passed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, to think she paid so much attention to adventurers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed. Some rulers would treat armed organizations who were not loyal to the country as enemies. Even the Empire isn\u2019t so generous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat princess sure is brilliant, coming out with all these great proposals\u2026 although almost all of them were shot down.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to marry a beautiful girl like that~\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, shouldn\u2019t you work on getting ennobled?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2014no way, no way, I couldn\u2019t live a stifled life like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think being a noble\u2019s not bad. After all, the Kingdom pretty much allows a noble to trample the peasants and do as they please.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a strong undercurrent of mockery hidden beneath Ninya\u2019s words. Ainz furrowed his nonexistent brows within his helmet, but Narberal remained still, a nonchalant look on her face. Lukrut replied in a jovial tone:</p><br/><p>\u201cUwah~ that tongue of yours is still so vicious. You really hate nobles, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know that some nobles are honorable, but my big sister was taken away by that pig. I can\u2019t not hate nobles.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026We\u2019re getting sidetracked here! We shouldn\u2019t be talking about this sort of thing in front of our comrades, Momon-shi and Miss Nabe.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Dyne tried to get everyone back on track, Peter coughed in an incredibly fake manner before continuing:</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so, we\u2019ll be searching for monsters in the nearby region. We\u2019re close to a developed region, so the monsters shouldn\u2019t be too strong. Does that displease you, Momon-san?\u201d</p><br/><p>Peter spread a piece of parchment on the table. It looked to be a map of the surrounding region. The map showed villages, forests, rivers, and so on.</p><br/><p>\u201cBasically, we\u2019ll be heading south and looking around this area.\u201d</p><br/><p>His finger moved from the center of the parchment to the vicinity of the southern forest.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be hunting monsters in the forest bordering the Slaine Theocracy. The only creatures who can hit the back line are Goblins with magic items that grant flight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, we won\u2019t get much for killing such weak monsters.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz had his doubts about this group\u2019s easygoing attitude.</p><br/><p>From what Ainz knew, there were many kinds of named Goblins in YGGDRASIL, and their levels ranged from one to fifty. Since individual Goblins could vary widely in power, one could not lump the Goblins into one big group. A moment\u2019s carelessness could lead to dire consequences.</p><br/><p>Did their relaxed attitudes mean that they were confident of not encountering high-level Goblins, or did it mean that this world\u2019s Goblins were simply that weak?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What if a powerful Goblin shows up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhile it\u2019s true that powerful Goblins exist, they won\u2019t show up in the forest we\u2019re heading towards, because these Goblins are usually tribal leaders. They won\u2019t mobilize their entire tribes just for us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Goblins know about humanity\u2019s area of influence, so they\u2019re fully aware of the retaliation that\u2019ll be headed that way if they launch a large-scale attack. It\u2019s especially true when it comes to the stronger Goblins, since they tend to be the higher-ranked and more intelligent members of their species.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlus, Nabe-san can use third tier magic. So it should be fine even if we encounter high level Goblins, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. However, I\u2019d like to remind you that there are Goblins who can use third tier magic. Just for my reference, could you tell me about the monsters we might encounter?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Swords of Darkness turned in unison to look at Ninya. Picking up on their thoughts, Ninya began explaining with a teacherly look on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re likely to encounter Goblins and the wolves they raise. As for other monsters, there haven\u2019t been any strong ones sighted around this area. The most dangerous monsters we might encounter on the plains are probably ogres.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t be entering the forest?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, because the forest is very dangerous. We can still deal with things like Jumping Leeches and Giant Beetles, but the Hanging Spiders which spit webs at you from the trees and the Forest Worms which maul you from the ground with their huge jaws are harder to handle.\u201d</p><br/><p>No wonder.</p><br/><p>Ainz nodded in acknowledgement. So their aim was to hunt the monsters from the forest which made their way onto the plains.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how it is, Momon-san. How about it? Want to lend us a hand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Mm. Then, I\u2019ll be in your care\u2026 although before that, could you tell me about the pay for this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, yes, that\u2019s right, the payment is very important. Basically, since Momon-san\u2019s team and our team are working together, the plan is to split it evenly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGoing by the numbers in our teams, it seems awfully generous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, when the monsters appear, I hope you and Nabe-san will take half of them as well. We can only use spells of up to the second tier. So when we factor your abilities in, that division of the money seems quite logical.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz pretended to think for a while before nodding his head in agreement.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have no problems with that arrangement. Then, let us fight shoulder to shoulder. Also, since we\u2019re working together, I guess I should let everyone see my true face.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, Momonga removed his helmet. The four people before him seemed quite surprised by what they saw.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Black eyes and hair like Nabe-san, so he shouldn\u2019t have been born in this area. I\u2019ve heard that in the south, people like Momon-san are commonplace\u2026 did you come from that region?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. We have come here from a faraway land.\u201d</p><br/><p>He\u2019s older than I thought, he\u2019s already an uncle.</p><br/><p>Hey, that\u2019s rude.</p><br/><p>A warrior on par with a magic caster of the third tier should be around that age.</p><br/><p>Miss Nabe\u2019s pretty amazing too.</p><br/><p>Ainz\u2019s keen ears picked up their whispered words, with the exception of Peter\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Being called an uncle made Ainz feel uncomfortable, but it probably couldn\u2019t be helped that he was an uncle in the eyes of these youngsters. If one was an adult by the age of sixteen, then Ainz was definitely an uncle to them.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be covering my face up after showing it to you. There might be trouble if other people know I\u2019m a foreigner.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, Ainz put his helmet back on again. After that, he smiled in satisfaction under his helmet. This was because Ainz had enchanted himself with an illusion \u2014 although it was a low-grade type, which would be seen through if touched \u2014 just in case.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince we\u2019ll be hunting together, it would probably be good to get questions out of the way at this point. Do you have anything to ask me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe!\u201d</p><br/><p>A hand shot up toward the ceiling after Ainz asked his question. That hand belonged to Lukrut.</p><br/><p>After making sure that nobody else was asking a question other than himself, Lukrut cheerfully asked Narberal:</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of relationship do you two have!\u201d</p><br/><p>The room was filled with silence.</p><br/><p>Ainz had no idea what Lukrut meant by that question. However, Peter and his people had picked up on Lukrut\u2019s intentions.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026We are companions.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Ainz\u2019s answer, Lukrut\u2019s next few words threw the room into an uproar.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve fallen for you! It\u2019s love at first sight! Please go out with me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone turned to look at Lukrut. After realising that Lukrut\u2019s words were not a joke to deepen their friendship, Ainz shifted his gaze to Narberal. As the center of attention, Narberal took a deep breath before replying:</p><br/><p>\u201cSilence, inferior lifeform (slug). Learn your place before speaking again, or should I rip your tongue out of your head.\u201d</p><br/><p>The silence was even more deafening than before.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, no\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz made to lighten the mood, but Lukrut stole a march on him and said, \u201cThank you for the firm rejection! Then, let\u2019s start as friends!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDie, inferior lifeform (maggot). How could I possibly be friends with you? Or do you want me to gouge out your eyeballs with a spoon?\u201d</p><br/><p>After turning away from the feuding pair, Ainz and Peter bowed to each other in apology.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026My comrade has made trouble for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I should be the one apologizing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll call it quits, then. Is that all right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Peter looked around before speaking, though he kept his eyes from the grinning Lukrut and the cold-eyed Narberal.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, Momon-san. If you\u2019re ready, then let\u2019s move out. We\u2019re already prepared.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing the word \u201cready,\u201d Ainz suddenly thought of something.</p><br/><p>They had already purchased the minimum required gear from the innkeeper. Although Ainz and Narberal did not need to waste space on food and drinks, it would be weird if they did not eat or drink anything, so they had some ready just in case.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll right, once we distribute the rations, we can set out right away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre rations the only thing you need to prepare? If you\u2019re not going to buy them from a specialist shop, why not get some dry rations from the counter? They\u2019ll prepare them for you right away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so? That\u2019s good to hear. We can finish our preparations right away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone rose and left the room.</p><br/><p>\u2666 \u2666 \u2666</p><br/><p>After returning to the guild lobby, there were more adventurers than before, and there were several teams standing near the parchment-covered noticeboard. However, everyone\u2019s attention seemed focused on a certain teenager.</p><br/><p>The blond-haired teenager was talking to one of the counter girls, and the other two receptionists were leaning in to eavesdrop on their conversation. If things had been busy when Ainz came in, the current situation was now the exact opposite.</p><br/><p>The counter girl\u2019s face \u2014 no, her mouth was in an O shape. It was a look of surprise. And the person she was looking at was none other than Ainz himself.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s going on here?</p><br/><p>Just as doubt started welling up inside Ainz, the counter girl approached and said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is a job here asking for you by name.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those words changed the air in the room instantly. Ainz could feel many curious eyes staring unreservedly at him.</p><br/><p>The Swords of Darkness were similarly shocked.</p><br/><p>Narberal shifted briefly at the unpleasant change in the room\u2019s atmosphere. This was to make it easier to act during the critical early stages of a battle.</p><br/><p>Ainz could not help but feel worried by this.</p><br/><p>This is bad, Narberal\u2019s movements are bad. Judging by the way Narberal stood beside him, she must have thought that something strange was about to happen and had taken up a defensive posture to protect Ainz. However, it was an action completely unfitting for a situation like this. Normal people would not do such a thing under these circumstances.</p><br/><p>Granted, protecting Ainz was her top priority, but her movements were far too thoughtless.</p><br/><p>You idiot. Albedo\u2019s the same way too. What the hell are the both of you thinking? No\u2026 it\u2019s more like they didn\u2019t think at all. They feel like they can crush humans like insects because they look down on them.</p><br/><p>While that sort of attitude could not be helped from NPCs of a guild composed of heteromorphic beings (Ainz Ooal Gown), there was a time and place for that sort of thing.</p><br/><p>An annoyed Ainz wanted to ask his past comrades, \u201cWhy are all your NPCs like this?\u201d He did not care what kind of backstory they had, but they needed to have basic social skills, as well as the ability to take note of the time, place, situation, and respond accordingly.</p><br/><p>He did not have time to scold Narberal now. If someone discovered that Narberal was in battle mode, who knew what sort of trouble they might get into.</p><br/><p>Ainz immediately karate chopped Narberal on the head. Although he did not use his full strength, he was still wearing his Jarngreipr. Narberal looked back at Ainz with tear-filled eyes, a look of surprise and confusion on her face, as though Ainz had grievously wounded her with that strike. However, Ainz paid her no heed and asked the counter girl:</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd who is this person who has asked for me by name?\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment those words cleared his mouth, Ainz cursed himself. Who else could it be but the boy in front of him?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat would be Nfirea Bareare-san.\u201d</p><br/><p>I just heard that name \u2014 as Ainz thought this, the boy approached him.</p><br/><p>\u201cPleased to meet you. I was the one who put out that job.\u201d</p><br/><p>The boy nodded slightly, and Ainz returned the gesture.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, this request\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>Before the boy could finish speaking, Ainz raised his hand to interrupt:</p><br/><p>\u201cMy deepest apologies, but I\u2019ve already made an agreement with someone else for a job, so I cannot accept your request right away.\u201d</p><br/><p>The air in the room seemed to shudder as he said this. The reaction of the Swords of Darkness was more intense than Ainz\u2019s own:</p><br/><p>\u201cMomon-san! He asked for you by name!\u201d</p><br/><p>Peter\u2019s response filled Ainz with doubt. Was a personal request something to be surprised about? However\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cThat may be so, but should I not carry out the job I\u2019ve been requested to do earlier?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz\u2019s decision seemed to have been the right one. Some of the adventurers around him were nodding in approval. Just then, he had a flash of inspiration:</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever\u2026 our job is hardly a request. If we don\u2019t meet any monsters, there won\u2019t be any pay to speak of\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Peter\u2019s words to Ainz trailed off, and he sounded reluctant to speak them.</p><br/><p>Being hired by the boy with the famous grandmother was a far cry from wandering around the place trying to kill monsters. That was why Peter sounded like he wanted to give up on the job.</p><br/><p>With that conclusion in mind, Ainz gently said:</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Then how about this, Peter-san? Bareare-san has not told me about the job\u2019s details, payment, timeframe, and such. I will hear him out and make my decision then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right with that, of course. Though I\u2019d like to finish it quickly, it can wait a day or two.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, please allow my friends from Swords of Darkness to be present during the job briefing\u2026 no, I should say, if the negotiations fall through, I would like the privilege of carrying out my previous task first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Momon-san, is it all right for us to come with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. I hope you will be party to the discussion and provide your opinions.\u201d</p><br/><p>After the Swords of Darkness gave their approval, Ainz and company returned to the room from just now.</p><br/><p>He felt very busy.</p><br/><p>Once more, Ainz smiled bitterly and took his seat from just now. Narberal sat beside him, while the boy was one seat away from them. The Swords of Darkness went back to their previous places.</p><br/><p>The first to speak among them was, of course, the boy:</p><br/><p>\u201cThe receptionist mentioned it earlier, but I think it would be best if I introduced myself. I am Nfirea Bareare, and I work as a herbalist in this city. As for the details of the job, I will soon be heading into the nearby forest as planned. Since everyone knows the forest is dangerous, I was hoping that you could be my guardians, as well as help in harvesting herbs if possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBodyguarding, huh. I see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz nodded calmly. He had the feeling that this job would be a troublesome one.</p><br/><p>Ainz knew he was powerful, and he could probably exterminate any attacking monster when working with Narberal. However, he was not as confident when it came to carrying out an escort mission. This was because Ainz and Narberal were both magic casters, and lacked the specialized magic and skills needed to become shields for other people.</p><br/><p>\u201cCompared to the usual amount, the payment will be\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014Please hold on a moment. The task of bodyguarding suits you well. Then, Peter-san, would you like me to take you on instead?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s a job that involves bodyguarding and harvesting herbs, don\u2019t you think we\u2019d be more effective with Lukrut-san the ranger and Dyne-san the druid?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh! Good eye, Momon-shi. As a druid, I can show my true ability in the forest, perhaps even more so than Lukrut the ranger.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dyne\u2019s baritone seemed to carry an undercurrent of pride. Lukrut was not happy and said:</p><br/><p>\u201cDyne-san, you really went and said it, huh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an undeniable truth, given the abilities of druids! And don\u2019t forget that I\u2019m trained in herbalism too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph \u2014 Peter, I\u2019m fine too. I\u2019ll show you who\u2019s the better of us, between Druid-san and myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that to be agreement, then. If we see any monsters on the way, we\u2019ll kill them and claim the reward when we get back to town. As for Bareare-san\u2019s payment, what if we divided it equally, Peter-san?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re fine with it, then I have no objections, Momon-san.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBareare-san, sorry for the wait. If it\u2019s all right with you, could you permit everyone here to accept the job that you just offered?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind that. Then, I\u2019ll be counting on all of you. Ah, you can just call me Nfirea.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz and the others began introducing themselves to Nfirea. Although Narberal lashed Lukrut with her sharp tongue, they managed to successfully complete their self-introductions.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, what I\u2019ve done in the past is to proceed to Carne Village to set up a base of operations before venturing into the forest. The amount of time we\u2019ll spend depends on the herbs that we can gather, but it will be three days at the latest. In the past, it\u2019s been a couple of days on average.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWill we be walking there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, yes. There will be a horse cart, but it\u2019ll be full of pots and bottles for gathering herbs, so there\u2019s not much room for you to ride.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan we replenish our rations in Carne Village?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWater should be fine, but food might be a problem, because Carne Village isn\u2019t very big.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Swords of Darkness began discussing the preparations for the journey, as well as asking Nfirea several questions. As Ainz saw this, he decided to speak up as well:</p><br/><p>\u201cMay I ask a few questions?\u201d</p><br/><p>After seeing Nfirea smile and nod in reply, Ainz began with the first question.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy me? I\u2019ve only arrived in this city by carriage recently, and as such I have no friends here, nor am I renowned in this area. That being the case, why did you ask for me? In addition, you mentioned that you\u2019ve done this in the past, which implies that in the past you\u2019ve hired other adventurers. How about them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz\u2019s gaze was keen under his helmet.</p><br/><p>He did not know why the boy had called him out. If he had been exposed, then he would need to change his disguise and his approach to things.</p><br/><p>Ainz studied Nfirea closely \u2014 though he could not see his eyes, due to the hair concealing them \u2014 but he could not tell what the boy truly wanted.</p><br/><p>Could it be that he was overthinking this? Just as Ainz was beginning to get suspicious, Nfirea replied:</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, the adventurers I hired in the past have all left E-Rantel for another city. That\u2019s why I was looking for new adventurers. Also, actually\u2026 I heard about what happened in the inn from one of its guests.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened in the inn?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I heard that someone effortlessly threw an adventurer one rank higher than himself\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz had planned to use a show of strength to increase his renown. Had this boy taken the bait? Once more, as suspicion welled up in Ainz, Nfirea smiled and pointed to the plate on Ainz\u2019s breastplate.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlus, copper ranked adventurers are cheaper, right? Hopefully we\u2019ll get along for a while yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I do hope so.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz understood how it was like to hire an untested rookie. He slowly felt himself lowering his guard, but there was one thing that worried him. If that really happened \u2014</p><br/><p>As Ainz thought about this, the other were asking questions one by one, which Nfirea took in stride. After there were no more questions, Nfirea announced:</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, let\u2019s move out once we\u2019re ready!\u201d</p><br/><p>Part 5</p><br/><p>In the dead of night, a hooded person entered the giant graveyard of E-Rantel, with steps that made it seem as though it were gliding across the ground.</p><br/><p>The person\u2019s hooded, jet-black cape and the way its waist and shoulders did not move up and down as it advanced was quite peculiar, resembling a ghost when viewed from afar.</p><br/><p>The figure deftly avoided the magical illumination of the tomb and proceeded ever inward.</p><br/><p>Before long, the figure arrived at a mausoleum, and shed its hood.</p><br/><p>The figure was a young woman of around twenty, in the flower of her youth.</p><br/><p>She had a pretty face, and she was cute in the way of a kitten or other small animal. Still, while she looked adorable, there was a carnivore\u2019s predatory nature hidden under that face of hers.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m here~\u201d</p><br/><p>As she spoke in playful tones, the girl ran her fingers through her short blonde hair and pushed open the stone doors to the mausoleum. The noises of clattering metal came from under her cloak, like the sound of chain mail.</p><br/><p>Once inside the mausoleum, all the slabs for corpses were empty. The grave goods for the deceased had already been taken away.</p><br/><p>Perhaps it was the scent of all the incense absorbed by the stone, but a fragrant smell tickled the girl\u2019s nose.</p><br/><p>The girl furrowed her brows, then headed steadily inwards.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm hm hm \u2014 hm~\u201d</p><br/><p>The girl pressed on an unobtrusive little carving as she hummed. As the carving moved, there was a click as something made contact with something else. A moment later, the sound of grinding came forth. The slabs slowly moved aside, and a path leading downstairs appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming in~\u201d</p><br/><p>With those sing-song words, the girl descended the staircase. It curved halfway, and led to a wide open space beneath the earth.</p><br/><p>Although the walls and floor were made of mud, they looked like they had been reinforced so they would not collapse so easily. The air was relatively clean; the airflow to this place was good, which kept the air in here fresh.</p><br/><p>However, this was not part of the graveyard; it was something far more malevolent in nature.</p><br/><p>Menacing tapestries hung on the walls, with several crimson candles made from fresh blood below it. They gave off a pale radiance, as well as a smell of burning blood.</p><br/><p>The flickering flames generated countless shadows, and there were several holes here, big enough for people to pass through. The unique corpse stench of low tier undead wafted out from those holes.</p><br/><p>The girl looked around, and her eyes stopped on a certain place.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh~ creepy guy who\u2019s hiding in a corner, you\u2019ve got a guest~\u201d</p><br/><p>The man watching his surroundings from his hiding place in the dark corners of the room heard those words, and his shoulders trembled.</p><br/><p>\u201cHi~ I\u2019m here to meet Khazi-chan who\u2019s supposed to be here, is he~?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man seemed a little lost as to what to do, and as he heard the sound of footsteps again, his shoulders shook once more.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. You may leave now.\u201d</p><br/><p>After the newcomer spoke to the man, he revealed himself.</p><br/><p>He was a skinny man.</p><br/><p>His eyes were sunken in, and his face was a corpse-like pale white, which could be summarized in the word \u201clifeless.\u201d His scalp was bereft of any hair, nor were there any eyebrows, eyelashes, or any body hair at all. He gave the impression that he was completely hairless.</p><br/><p>Given that, there was no way to tell his age at all, but since there were no wrinkles on his skin, he probably was not that old.</p><br/><p>The man was dressed in a dark red robe that was the color of dried blood, and wore a necklace made of the skulls of small animals. His hands were so shrivelled that they resembled claws, and his fingers \u2014 tipped with dirty yellow fingernails \u2014 were wrapped around a black staff. Rather than a human, he looked more like an undead monster.</p><br/><p>\u201cHai~ Khazi-chan~\u201d</p><br/><p>The man frowned as he heard the girl\u2019s playful greeting.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you not address me like that? It\u2019ll damage the reputation of Zuranon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuranon.</p><br/><p>They were a powerful and evil secret society, counting several veteran magic casters among their number and led by a wise leader. After orchestrating several tragedies, they had become enemies of the countries in the region.</p><br/><p>\u201cReeeeally\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>The fact that the girl did not wish to change the way she addressed him made the man frown even more.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026And then? Why did you come here? You know I\u2019m infusing energy into the Orb of Death, right? If you\u2019re here to make trouble, I have ways to deal with that too.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man narrowed his eyes, and tightened his grip on his staff.</p><br/><p>\u201cNooooo, Khazi-chan~ I just came here to bring you this~\u201d</p><br/><p>The girl flashed him a coquettish smile and reached around under her cape. There was the sound of clattering, and then the girl triumphantly produced the item she had been looking for.</p><br/><p>It was a circlet.</p><br/><p>Countless small gems adorned thin, metallic threads, looking for all the world like a spiderweb covered in water droplets. The item was exquisitely made, and in the middle of the circlet \u2014 where the wearer\u2019s forehead would go \u2014 was a large black crystal.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2014!\u201d</p><br/><p>The man could not help but stare in silence.</p><br/><p>Although he had only seen it from a distance, there was no mistake here. This was the crown he had seen once before.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe symbol of a Miko Princess, the Crown of Wisdom! This is one of the treasures of the Slaine Theocracy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCorrect~ I saw a cute girl wearing this strange crown, but it looked so wrong on her head that I took it off~ And then I was sooooo surprised! She went mad~ peeing and crapping herself~\u201d</p><br/><p>The girl convulsed in laughter.</p><br/><p>The Miko Princesses stood at the heart of the Slaine Theocracy\u2019s rituals. There was no way that she \u2014 as a former member of the Black Scripture \u2014 would not know what would happen when she snatched the Crown of Wisdom away from its bearer.</p><br/><p>After all, when the time came for a new Miko Princess to be appointed, the job of the Black Scripture was to remove the Crown from its current wearer, and then promptly send the now-insane Miko Princess to be with the gods.</p><br/><p>\u201cStill, it can\u2019t be helped. It\u2019s the only way to obtain this \u2014 it\u2019s the fault of the person who made the Crown, he\u2019s the one to blame~\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no way to safely remove the Crown of Wisdom. The only option was to destroy it.</p><br/><p>However, the Crown would delete the wearer\u2019s personality and turn a human being into a magic item that could use incredibly high-tiered spells, so nobody would do anything wasteful like destroying it.</p><br/><p>Still, there were such madmen around.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, to think you\u2019d betray the Black Scripture for such trash. Why not steal one of the divine artifacts of the Six Gods?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCalling it trash is too mean~\u201d</p><br/><p>The man laughed at the girl who puffed up her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing wrong with calling it trash, right? Girls who can wear an item like this are one in a million. Finding a wearer for this would probably be impossible, even in the Slaine Theocracy.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Slaine Theocracy was the only one in the surrounding countries that kept detailed registers and genealogies of its citizens. Therefore, by consulting those registers, one could easily find a wearer for the item \u2014 in other words, a sacrifice.</p><br/><p>Without that, it would be hard for even Zuranon to find such a person.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut really now, it\u2019s impossible to get those artifacts~ After all, that antique show is guarded by the strongest monster of the Black Scripture, that ancient beast with the blood of the Six Gods that\u2019s beyond the realm of humanity~\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA God-Kin, huh\u2026 Is that fellow really that strong? I\u2019ve only heard about it from you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s stronger than the idea of strength. The relevant information has been sealed up, which is why you don\u2019t know~ If someone who knew about it was interrogated with mind-affecting magic, it would be really bad. I\u2019ve heard that if the secret got out, it\u2019d lead to total war with the surviving true Dragon Lords, which means the Slaine Theocracy would get destroyed in the crossfire, so I hope you\u2019ll pretend you never heard any of it~\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I find that hard to believe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, anyone who hasn\u2019t seen that power would think so~ Well then, let\u2019s get down to business, Khazit Dale Badantel \u2014 are you willing to help me out as a fellow member of the Twelve Executives?\u201d</p><br/><p>The girl\u2019s tone finally changed.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, showing your true face at last, oh fragment of Quintia? But don\u2019t call me Dale. I\u2019ve cast away that baptismal name.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Then, don\u2019t call me a fragment of Quintia, hm? Call me Clementine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Clementine, what do you want me to help you with?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a pretty outstanding talent holder in this town, no? Maybe that guy could wear this item~\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I see, that guy from the stories. Still, you could easily handle the task of kidnapping a single human being by yourself, no?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, that\u2019s right~ But I\u2019d like some sort of confusion while I make my move~\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see\u2026 a distraction while you flee, huh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about it? What if I was willing to help with your ritual? It\u2019s a good deal, right~?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man \u2014 Khazit \u2014 narrowed his eyes, and smiled evilly:</p><br/><p>\u201cWonderful, Clementine. If you\u2019re willing to help me, I can carry out the rite of death. Very well, I shall aid you with all the resources at my disposal.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

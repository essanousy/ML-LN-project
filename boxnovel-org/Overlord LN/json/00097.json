The demihumans had already lost the will to fight, so all that was left was to mop them up. There were practically no casualties on the side of Holy Kingdom, but the ground was littered with demihuman corpses.</p><br/><p>Now that the enemy general Jaldabaoth had been defeated, nobody could stand in the way of the Holy Kingdom Liberation Army.</p><br/><p>Recapturing the city of Prart and the capital city of Hoburns was practically instantaneous.</p><br/><p>It would take a while longer to free the city of Rimun, which was further west, and there were still people suffering in villages which had been converted to detention camps, but this was already a big step.</p><br/><p>The liberated capital was filled with joyous sounds, and their ardor had not abated even after a whole day. In fact, it actually grew livelier.</p><br/><p>However, the brass \u2015 Neia included \u2015 knew that there was still a veritable mountain of problems to be dealt with.</p><br/><p>The first issue was food. The demihumans had eaten everything and caused a shortage of food. It would surely hamper the progress of the Holy Kingdom in the future.</p><br/><p>The next was the people who had died. Losses in the workforce could be replaced. However, if the deceased were skilled craftsmen, scholars, or people who might one day become them, then the loss of knowledge would be a fatal blow to the nation.</p><br/><p>And then there was the matter of resources. The demihumans had plundered and destroyed many things, and rebuilding all of them would take a lot of resources.</p><br/><p>Finally, there was the matter of time. The demihumans had taken a full two seasons during their invasion, and they would need to work twice as hard to make up for the loss.</p><br/><p>And of course, there might be demihumans lurking within the Holy Kingdom. They would need to be rooted out and exterminated.</p><br/><p>The location of most of the loot taken by the demihumans \u2015 valuables and magic items \u2015 was unknown. The demihumans all had separate cultures of their own, so adorning themselves with precious metals and collecting human wealth was hardly a strange thing, However, the strange thing was that there were no clues at all as to where those things had been taken. That was because they had been completely unable to track the enemy\u2019s transport units.</p><br/><p>Still, however many problems lay ahead of them, there would be people who felt that it would be fine if they could lose themselves in frank and honest revelry. They would need a short break before the painful days to come, and Neia agreed on that point as well.</p><br/><p>However, she could not do that today. She could not lose herself in celebration on this day.</p><br/><p>The reason for that was because it was a day of parting.</p><br/><p>It was a very sad day.</p><br/><p>There was a lone carriage stopped in front of the royal capital\u2019s main gate, on the eastern side of the city. In contrast to the carriage\u2019s plain exterior, Neia knew that its interior was lavishly and meticulously fitted, and its performance was also excellent. In particular, its seats did not hurt the bottom even after long periods spent sitting on them.</p><br/><p>Indeed.</p><br/><p>It was the carriage Neia had been allowed to share with the Sorcerer King when he had come to the Holy Kingdom.</p><br/><p>In other words, today was the day when the Sorcerer King would leave the Holy Kingdom and return to his own country.</p><br/><p>Originally, it would not have been a surprise to see a carriage of the Sorcerous Kingdom surrounded by demihumans. The Sorcerer King had united the Abelion Hills and brought many of the demihumans under his banner for the battle with Jaldabaoth. That said, there were none of them in sight, because the Sorcerer King had allowed them all to return to the hills.</p><br/><p>This was not a matter of the past few days. He had let them return after the final battle with Jaldabaoth had ended.</p><br/><p>When she had asked the reason for that, she had received the answer, \u201cYou must hate being around the demihumans, don\u2019t you?\u201d Such was his sympathy for the people of the Holy Kingdom.</p><br/><p>Neia was deeply moved.</p><br/><p>He had considered the mental state of the Holy Kingdom and let his own soldiers return home, saying that they would travel in the company of the soldiers of the Holy Kingdom, who were from another nation. This was by no means ordinary behavior for the ruler of a nation.</p><br/><p>Indeed, unless it were the King of Kings \u2015 the magnanimous Sorcerer King.</p><br/><p>Neia\u2019s group of like-minded supporters were also deeply moved.</p><br/><p>Therefore, when Neia and her comrades had taken it upon themselves to become the Sorcerer King\u2019s honor guard, nobody could bring themselves to protest. Of course, there was almost no more fighting, so for the most part they simply moved with the Sorcerer King, but the faces of her comrades were still fresh in Neia\u2019s memories.</p><br/><p>She remembered their joy at being able to walk with the person who had saved them, their pride at being able to accompany the hero who had defeated Jaldabaoth, and then the bliss of being allowed to stand by the side of the king they so admired. Their faces all blended these differing emotions.</p><br/><p>They were nowhere in sight today.</p><br/><p>All she could see were the walls and the main gate of the Holy Kingdom\u2019s capital, and then the street leading to Prart \u2015 which continued on to the Sorcerous Kingdom.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you going back today, Your Majesty? The people are all abuzz with joy after the liberation of the royal capital. I feel it would not be out of place to have Your Majesty join us for the next few days, in a thanksgiving festival for the person who was the biggest contributor towards taking back the capital within a few days\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She had asked that question several times in the past. She would probably get the answer she knew she would receive, that he was heading home. Even so, she still had to ask it again. It was probably the work of Neia\u2019s feminine side.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh, I\u2019ll be returning to the Sorcerous Kingdom today. I\u2019m not confident in my ability to deal with ceremonies.\u201d</p><br/><p>As the Sorcerer King muttered to himself, he made a very exaggerated movement, like a comical shrugging of his shoulders, perhaps because he knew Neia would feel distressed if she took his words to heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cSurely you jest, Your Majesty.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUmu, well, yes I was, I was just kidding. Yes, kidding\u2026 In truth, I\u2019ve done everything I came here to do. Thus, there is no need for me to stay here. I also need to guide the development of the Sorcerous Kingdom, in my capacity as its king. If I leave the throne for long, my Prime Minister Albedo will scold me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Neia\u2019s mind conjured up the visage of the world class beauty she had seen but once. She was a woman whose beauty made her unforgettable.</p><br/><p>Surely she can\u2019t be that scary when she gets mad\u2026 or is she scary when she gets mad because she\u2019s beautiful? While I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what His Majesty meant, it\u2019s a little hard to imagine someone as pretty as that getting angry. Still\u2026 I\u2019m envious\u2026</p><br/><p>Being allowed to speak to him like that, because she was close to him, was something that Neia desperately wanted, yet could not ask for, which made her very envious. How happy would Neia be if she heard the Sorcerer King she so respected tell others Neia will scold me or something like that?</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so\u2026 still, it is a shame that there\u2019s nobody to send off Your Majesty, given that you saved this nation.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Sorcerer King\u2019s decision to go had been a sudden thing. The fact that there was nobody to send him off told a sad and lonely story.</p><br/><p>\u201cI already told Prince Caspond that it would be troublesome if the festival was too lavish. This nation will be facing a lot of difficulties from now on. Rather than waste resources and manpower on sending me off, I\u2019d rather have them use it on rebuilding the country.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Why did he have to go back?</p><br/><p>If she clung to his feet and made a big scene of weeping, she could probably delay his return to his nation by a week.</p><br/><p>While she keenly felt the desire to do so, she bore with it. She could not act spoilt around the most merciful Sorcerer King.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, it\u2019s not because I want to act like some kind of big shot, uh, it\u2019s just that this country really has nothing left, yes\u2026 like wealth. While I thought that asking them to leave a bit more might be good\u2026 What I mean to say is, ah yes, I would like you all to not mind me and keep working hard. Also\u2026 look, the stability of your country will be good for the Sorcerous Kingdom too, as neighbors. There\u2019ll be trade between us and so on in the future, yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>So he had sensed what Neia was thinking, and he was fumbling to comfort her. While he was typically very cool and stylish, he sometimes spoke in a way that made her worry for him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you very much, Your Majesty.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Hm, don\u2019t, don\u2019t worry about it. I came to this country for Jaldabaoth\u2019s maids, after all. And now\u2015\u201d The Sorcerer King patted Shizu \u2015 who had been standing beside him all this time, as though she were trying to mask her presence \u2015 on the back. \u201c\u2015And now I have them, so it was worth coming to this country.\u201d</p><br/><p>Neia felt it was a little embarrassing that the Holy Kingdom could not give the Sorcerer King anything.</p><br/><p>The Sorcerer King had gained Shizu \u2015 the maid demon \u2015 with his own strength. Neia and everyone who shared her beliefs felt the same way.</p><br/><p>There had been discussions about what they would give to him, but someone had mentioned that since he was a king, having someone who did not represent the country giving him a present would instead be very rude, and so the plan had fallen through.</p><br/><p>At the very least, Neia had hoped that Caspond would make some concessions on a national level, or sign a treaty which was unfavorable to the Holy Kingdom.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026If you so desire, I can resurrect your parents with a grand spell that can only be used once every year, you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you very much, Your Majesty, but \u2015 there is no need for that.\u201d</p><br/><p>During the liberation of the capital city, one of the prisoners had witnessed Neia\u2019s mother fall in battle. She had heard of her mother\u2019s valiant last stand from him. Surely she would not be angry even if she was not resurrected.</p><br/><p>In addition, it was said that resurrection spells required extremely valuable materials as a material component, and Neia would be hard-pressed to afford those. Perhaps the most merciful Sorcerer King might supply them for free, but she could not keep relying on the Sorcerer King\u2019s largesse for her own sake.</p><br/><p>However, it would seem the demihumans had disposed of the corpse, so she could not even bid her a final farewell, which was quite sad.</p><br/><p>\u201cTalking for too long will only make the parting hurt more. I ought to be going soon. Shizu, is there anything you want to tell Miss Baraja?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Bye.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright! Goodbye!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shizu extended a hand to Neia, who shook it.</p><br/><p>And then, the two of them let go without any further ado.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Are the two of you alright with this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026It\u2019ll be\u2026 fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. Then \u2015 we\u2019re going, Shizu.\u201d</p><br/><p>As the Sorcerer King put one foot on the step leading up to his carriage, he turned back to address Neia.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026This country will experience many difficulties in the future, but\u2026 I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be able to work hard and pull through it. I hope to see you again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as the Sorcerer King was about to enter his carriage, Neia looked at his back and could not stop herself from shouting:</p><br/><p>\u201cMajesty! Your Majesty!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Sorcerer King paused on the step of his carriage and looked back. Neia gulped, worked up her courage, and asked in a trembling voice:</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, excuse me! Could I, could I call you Ainz-sama!?\u201d</p><br/><p>The cheek of her. Surely she, as a commoner from another nation, would be scolded for daring to address him in such a familiar fashion.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Eh? Ahh, yes, you may\u2026 call me anything you want.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you very much.\u201d</p><br/><p>She bowed deeply to the magnanimous king of another nation, and by the time she raised her head, it was Shizu\u2019s turn to board the carriage.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake care, Shizu-sempai!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shizu stuck out her thumb, and then she vanished into the carriage.</p><br/><p>Perhaps it had sensed the two of them had boarded, but the horse whinnied and trotted off.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2015Then, Your Majesty!\u201d</p><br/><p>As she watched the carriage move off, Neia could no longer hide her tears as she shouted:</p><br/><p>\u201cLong live His Majesty the Sorcerer King!\u201d</p><br/><p>She was not the only one shouting at the top of her voice.</p><br/><p>There was more than one gate in the royal capital. Her fellow believers had used the other gates and secretly gathered so they could pop up outside the gate to loudly wish the Sorcerer King well.</p><br/><p>\u201cLong may he live!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLong may he live!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLong may he live!\u201d</p><br/><p>At the same time, they scattered the flowers they had struggled so hard to collect.</p><br/><p>The carriage carried on amidst all this.</p><br/><p>It was hardly a fitting send off for the man who had saved the Holy Kingdom. Even so, it was the best effort from Neia and the people who understood how she felt.</p><br/><p>The carriage shrank in her tear-dimmed vision.</p><br/><p>Neia sobbed.</p><br/><p>She felt so lonely now.</p><br/><p>She wanted the Sorcerer King and Shizu to ask \u201cWould you like to come to the Sorcerous Kingdom?\u201d If they had asked that, Neia might have abandoned everything to go with them.</p><br/><p>But they had not.</p><br/><p>She hated it.</p><br/><p>In the end, Neia had been nothing more than a squire for his brief stay in this country.</p><br/><p>All manner of negative emotions roiled up inside her.</p><br/><p>However \u2015 that was wrong.</p><br/><p>In Neia\u2019s ears echoed the words which the Sorcerer King had said.</p><br/><p>\u2026This country will experience many difficulties in the future, but\u2026 I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be able to work hard and pull through it. I hope to see you again.</p><br/><p>In other words, he had expectations for Neia.</p><br/><p>Something like, though the Holy Kingdom is in chaos, I\u2019m sure Neia can pull the country together, or something.</p><br/><p>It had felt like a long time, but also a very short time, but it had changed her life tremendously \u2015 and now it was over. However, this was only the beginning. There were many things she had to do.</p><br/><p>For starters, she had to repay the Sorcerer King\u2019s kindness with her actions.</p><br/><p>Then, she would need to rebuild this country. Justice and evil. Neia had never really understood what those two words meant, but now she could hold her chest high and answer.</p><br/><p>The Sorcerer King was justice, she would say. And being weak was a sin. The important thing was to work hard to be strong, and so on.</p><br/><p>Neia had to spread the truths she had learned throughout the Holy Kingdom.</p><br/><p>\u201cBaraja-sama, please wipe your tears.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was Beldran.</p><br/><p>At a closer look, his eyes were also red. Perhaps he had wiped his own tears before coming to Neia\u2019s side, but his voice was still trembling, so he had clearly wept recently.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Neia forcefully wiped her tears away, just like how Shizu had first wiped her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cBaraja-sama. The people who witnessed that battle all want to hear about the Sorcerer King. Many more have come with their families in tow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand. We\u2019ll tell them that His Majesty \u2015 Ainz-sama is a truly noble king, and also about Shizu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Neia looked straight ahead.</p><br/><p>\u201cGoodbyes really are depressing. However \u2015 Everyone! Let\u2019s go! Let us spread the truth \u2015 that His Majesty is justice \u2015 to more people!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2015Ohhhh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Over 3,000 people shouted in unison, and then they fell into step behind Neia.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The carriage moved on.</p><br/><p>The long project was finally over. Ainz had never experienced it himself, but this must have been what it felt like to be an expatriate. Even if he had returned to Nazarick from time to time, this might have been the first time he had been away from it for so long.</p><br/><p>He had thrown the matter of ruling the demihumans of the Abelion Hills to Albedo, and he had handed the entirety of the Holy Kingdom\u2019s future affairs to Demiurge.</p><br/><p>In other words, Ainz had taken the weight off his shoulders. He sighed, subtly enough that Shizu \u2015 who was sitting opposite him \u2015 did not notice. While he had switched Demiurge\u2019s script to easy mode halfway through, the fatigue from all the complicated events until that point had not yet been fully eliminated. However, he did feel the sense of relaxation which came from solving a previously insoluble problem.</p><br/><p>That said, after returning to Nazarick \u2015 E-Rantel, rather \u2015 he would need to carefully and slowly take care of the work he had put off for the past two seasons. Once, he had put his stamp on documents in a slapdash manner, trusting that Albedo had already looked them over, only to be told, \u201cTruly, only Ainz-sama could make decisions so swiftly. I am filled with respect.\u201d Ainz had wondered whether that assessment of him was sarcastic or not.</p><br/><p>Indeed. It was not because he had work waiting for him that he had not used \u300cGate\u300d \u2015 which could take him back in an instant.</p><br/><p>Definitely not.</p><br/><p>There were ways to teleport to places one had not seen before, but it was still too early for that. It would do no good to show his hand. Of course, the Hanzo on the carriage had said nothing, and the anti-divination spell he had cast had not been triggered. It was a clear sign that nobody was monitoring Ainz and the others, but the opposition might be using methods which Ainz did not know about.</p><br/><p>Since there\u2019s time, I can wait until we reach a more sheltered place to cast the teleportation spell, Ainz thought.</p><br/><p>Indeed. It was definitely not because he wanted to keep away from those documents he could not understand no matter how many times he read them.</p><br/><p>Still, if there was a problem\u2015</p><br/><p>Shizu hasn\u2019t said anything since she got on the carriage\u2026</p><br/><p>Neia had been that way too, but he always felt restless when he shared a carriage with someone else and they remained quiet. He could casually mention something if the other party were a man, but he would have to watch his words since she was female.</p><br/><p>Can\u2019t you say something, Shizu? That thought had been in Ainz\u2019s mind ever since the beginning. Regretfully, it did not seem like it would be happening anytime soon. Finally, Ainz was no longer able to bear the silence, and after preparing himself for the worst, he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cShizu, how do you feel about leaving Nazarick to work on your own? Do you have any questions or suggestions for the future?\u201d</p><br/><p>He would start by listening to a report from his subordinate, who had been busy with work when she had been sent out for an errand.</p><br/><p>While he was not good at speaking to women, it was fine when he imagined them as female coworkers.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I think\u2026 worked hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so? You have worked very hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was the end of the conversation. It was dead and gone.</p><br/><p>Even if he waited a little longer, he ought not to expect Shizu to carry on.</p><br/><p>Once the words \u201cworked hard\u201d were mentioned, it was very difficult to continue on from there. She had not answered the question about having any questions or future suggestions.</p><br/><p>That said, these thoughts of his were merely the shallow contemplations of a superior. He ought to be thinking, Since she worked hard, all I have to do is wait for the results. There were also benefits in doing so. That was because the implication was that nothing had happened which might cause a problem or become an issue.</p><br/><p>However, Shizu continued speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026It\u2019s hard to think on your own and then take action\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed, that is the case.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shizu had been working in Nazarick all this time, and all she had done was receive instructions and carry them out. However, he had only given her rough instructions this time, and then the actions she took based on the decisions she made within the scope of those instructions were her first task. For all he knew, that might have been too broad for her. Perhaps he should have started by giving her a simpler task, but Ainz also knew that Shizu had given him concrete results.</p><br/><p>\u201cStill, it\u2019s hardly unusual for the Pleiades to go outside for their work. The fact that the maid demons are now the Sorcerer King\u2019s minions has spread from the Holy Kingdom to the other nations by now. In future, you may be given orders which result in you leading subordinates of your own for activities outside Nazarick. This was a good experience. But giving vague instructions was a bad idea. Just as I thought, the person giving orders has to make them clear\u2015\u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, Ainz sensed that he was digging his own grave. As the pinnacle of Nazarick, Ainz was the most likely to give out orders.</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t possibly come up with concrete action plans. Or rather, if I come up with shallow plans, Albedo and Demiurge will frown on me!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2015should emphasize adapting to the situation, and come up with plans that give a certain degree of leeway. In the end, it\u2019s still the person on the ground who knows best!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Yes. I learned a lot more compared to just following instructions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh, indeed, just so. I understand how you feel very well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz scratched his head as he nodded, but then as he realized the difference in competency between Shizu and himself \u2015 whose nonexistent stomach ached when he had read Demiurge\u2019s reports \u2015 he wept softly in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeaking of which,\u201d Ainz decided to change the subject. If he went on, he might only end up shocking himself more. \u201cIt seems you and Miss Baraja got along very well. It felt like a shame that we had to part.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I was interested\u2026 in her\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2015Really!? That\u2019s wonderful!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz\u2019s expression of joy was genuine.</p><br/><p>Suzuki Satoru had not had children before, but he could understand how a parent felt when one heard that a child who had no friends had made friends for the first time.</p><br/><p>Ah, I\u2019m glad I resurrected her\u2026 hm? What does being interested mean\u2026 don\u2019t tell me she\u2019s not a friend, but more like a toy\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Can I assume that you are friends?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shizu briefly bowed her head in thought, but in the end she replied with a \u201c\u2026yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz was filled with delight. However that explosion of joy was promptly negated.</p><br/><p>While he was unhappy about that, the thought that this might be the first time someone from Nazarick had made a friend outside brought a trickle of joy to his heart.</p><br/><p>Most of the people in Nazarick did not leave it, so they did not make friends outside. Perhaps if he let the other members go outside regularly, they would be able to make good friendships.</p><br/><p>Ainz did not think that people with friends were superior to others. However, thinking that one did not need friends was also incorrect.</p><br/><p>That said, it was always better to have the chance to make friends than not.</p><br/><p>I had my friends from Ainz Ooal Gown. In that case, it might be good to let the other members go outside and give them free time to interact with others\u2026 especially Mare and Aura. No, it\u2019s also possible that giving them all some time on their birthday is\u2026 umu.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you arranged to meet Neia again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026No\u2026 too far\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh! No need to worry about that. I\u2019ve already marked this place as a teleport point. You can go and have fun whenever you want. Just use \u300cGate\u300d. There\u2019s no need to be shy. Mm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026If I\u2019m free\u2026 please let me do so\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! Free\u2026 I\u2019ll give you lots of free time. I\u2019ve been thinking about a holiday plan for some time now. I should give the Pleiades a vacation too. Wouldn\u2019t it be good to go out and have fun with the others? I\u2019ve arranged to have you placed under me, so it should be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shizu thought briefly about it, and then shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026It\u2019ll cause problems.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cProblems, you say\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What does that mean? Problems for Neia? Or will it keep her from having fun with Neia? Or is it because the other members won\u2019t approve\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, if it causes problems then it can\u2019t be helped. You\u2019ll have to go on your own, Shizu. Speaking of which, let me change the topic. Miss Baraja\u2019s parents are both dead. Is that all right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Neia Baraja\u2019s parents were both dead. If she had asked him, he felt that it would be alright to resurrect them. If doing so would make her even more grateful\u2015</p><br/><p>No, that\u2019s not right.</p><br/><p>Simply put, resurrecting Neia\u2019s parents was not worth the cost of doing so. It was plain to see that Neia was sufficiently grateful to him. In that case, there was no need to continue scoring points with her. In addition, Wands of Resurrection were very expensive, so he wanted to save them, if possible. If Pestonya and the others were to use resurrection spells, then she would require gold coins or jewels or other valuables as part of the spell\u2019s cost.</p><br/><p>In truth, there were practically no benefits to be gained.</p><br/><p>However, it would be a different matter if it were Shizu\u2019s friend. I wouldn\u2019t mind giving Shizu\u2019s friend benefits like that.</p><br/><p>Because she seemed close to Shizu, he had asked her questions \u2015 both Neia as well as Shizu \u2015 to judge their reactions.</p><br/><p>\u201c..It\u2019s all right\u2026 Special treatment isn\u2019t good.\u201d\u201cReally? It would make an excellent present\u2026 in that case\u2026 well, that\u2019s it, then.\u201d</p><br/><p>In truth, resurrecting the dead \u2015 especially incomplete corpses \u2015 could prove very troublesome. There would be many people who would go How come you could do it for him and not for me? Also, it would be troublesome if he was asked to resurrect the Holy Queen. Granted, Demiurge could probably handle the situation if he did resurrect the Holy Queen, but the demerits outweighed the advantages.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want to play, how about reading that book? Would that be alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026It\u2019s fine\u2026 it\u2019s in the Doctor\u2019s room.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shizu possessed knowledge on all of Nazarick\u2019s mechanisms. Leaving it be like that was too dangerous, and she would not have been able to leave Nazarick. Therefore he had used \u300cControl Amnesia\u300d on her.</p><br/><p>Shizu\u2019s knowledge of those mechanisms had been part of the backstory her creator \u2014 a player \u2014 had made for her. While he did not know if the spell could work on such things, after casting it on her, he found that the spell worked as intended.</p><br/><p>That was a technique Ainz had developed after repeated experiments on a guinea pig he had obtained. It felt like he could do incredible things once he mastered it.</p><br/><p>The reason for that was because Ainz had the feeling he might be able to access the core of the NPCs. What exactly were the NPC backstories, the beginning of their memories? Still, that was simply wishful thinking on Ainz\u2019s part, and it was very likely that they were completely unrelated. If he wanted to sort that out, he would need to further understand the spell, and understand everything to do with the human memory. In that case, he would need a lot of guinea pigs and decades to practice and research with, as well as preparing himself for the possibility that it might all be a waste of time.</p><br/><p>Still, Shizu had currently been implanted with incorrect memories, so to some extent, she was a trap.</p><br/><p>Anyone trying to use Shizu to enter Nazarick would have a very bad time in store for them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Doctor\u2026 hm? Can those Shizus move?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026If the time comes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Aren\u2019t they just mechanisms, then? Ainz wanted to say that, but he did not. It was just like how Santa Claus\u2019s true identity was hidden under a veil of mystery.</p><br/><p>While Suzuki Satoru did not remember him ever visiting, he had come to visit in YGGDRASIL\u2015</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough, they were actually the devs.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Ainz laughed forlornly, he noticed Shizu looking intently at him, and so he said, \u201cI was just talking to myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Your Majesty.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Your Majesty.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What is it, Shizu?\u201d</p><br/><p>She had addressed him by his name in the past, but now she had suddenly switched to using his formal address. That slightly \u2015 or rather, greatly \u2015 disturbed Ainz.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Been too familiar all this time\u2026 is that how it was?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, what are you saying? I\u2019d feel sad if you called me Your Majesty. Ainz-sama will do. Frankly speaking, you don\u2019t even need the -sama. How about Ainz-san?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026That would be rude. I\u2019d get scolded.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c..Oh, I see. Well, you don\u2019t need to call me Your Majesty, at least.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Got it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh yes, how about the runecraft thing that I told you about over the \u300cMessage\u300d?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I tried.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It would seem it had not gone well. Still, it ought not to be a problem even if it failed.</p><br/><p>Still, maybe I should wait to return the items I lent, including that bow Ainz mused idly as he watched Shizu.</p><br/><p>When he had left, he had shared his carriage with a girl who kept glaring at him. On his way back, it was a girl with a blank face. Both of them were unique in their own way.</p><br/><p>As Ainz thought about this, he smiled.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Caspond looked outside from the deepest part of the royal palace \u2015 the Holy King\u2019s chambers.</p><br/><p>His coronation would be in a few days. Therefore, he had come to this empty room \u2015 including the break room beside this one \u2015 to calm his thoughts.</p><br/><p>The first person who would complain, and who would not mind her words was Remedios. She was currently meditating in her home. No, it would not be right to say she was meditating. Rather, she was gathering her strength at home. That was because he intended to have her find any demihumans that were still hiding within the Holy Kingdom and root them out.</p><br/><p>That said, he had still moved to the Holy King\u2019s room before the coronation had finished. This was a very good reason for Caspond\u2019s enemies to attack him. He had insisted on doing so even though he knew that because the power struggles had already begun.</p><br/><p>The aim was to establish the facts before the anti-Caspond nobles could say anything. Given that Caspond did not quite understand noble society, the ability to tell friend from foe was quite convenient. That too was part of the plan.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sure some of the nobles must be unhappy by how I took the throne without making arrangements with the other nobles. That\u2019s particularly true for the Southerners \u2015 the ones which he did not oppress. In that case, what will the Northerners I fought with think if I listened to them\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey would surely be unhappy, and become a major divisive factor. That way, the plan to divide the country in two will be complete.\u201d</p><br/><p>Caspond\u2019s self-directed mutterings received an answer.</p><br/><p>It was a gentle voice that seemed to seep into the heart. It belonged to the entity which was Caspond\u2019s superior.</p><br/><p>Caspond immediately turned and knelt to the speaker. He bowed, and then raised his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI bid you welcome, Demiurge-sama.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was not wearing his mask, and he had not changed his appearance before showing up. In other words, he was certain that this place was safe.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am here in order to move items back to Nazarick. Are there any problems?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNone at all. Everything has gone as you have planned, Demiurge-sama.\u201d</p><br/><p>Caspond smiled, and Demiurge returned it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhile there were some things which were beyond my expectations, the first phase of the plan has concluded without any problems, thanks to Ainz-sama\u2019s actions. I look forward to your good performance in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Caspond\u2019s head was bowed, but he knew those words were not true.</p><br/><p>Demiurge expected nothing of him. However, if he was about to jump the rails which had been laid for him, he would immediately jump in to correct the plan and keep it on track.</p><br/><p>He ought to have prepared several plans for revealing Caspond\u2019s true identity. His instructions had included several items which made him wonder why he had to do them. Those must have been intended to prepare for that moment.</p><br/><p>The first phase of the plan was to bring the Abelion Hills and the demihumans under the sway of the Sorcerous Kingdom. Before that, they would exterminate the troublesome species and then plant the seeds of a conflict between the Northern and Southern Holy Kingdom.</p><br/><p>After that, Caspond would be in charge of the second phase, which was to bring North and South into opposition, and then conflict.</p><br/><p>The final, third phase would be to have the Sorcerous Kingdom step in to take over everything.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I have a question regarding the item needed for that, which would be my corpse. Will you keep it here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no need for that. It has already been brought to Nazarick. When it is necessary for the plan, it can be brought here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The true Caspond\u2019s body was wrapped in an item known as a Shroud of Sleep, and it had apparently been brought to Nazarick.</p><br/><p>This magic item could arrest the decay of a corpse. He had been neatly killed with instant death magic upon capture, and his body had been preserved before rigor mortis could set in. If one touched it, one could still feel traces of his body heat. With that corpse, one would simply assume he had died all of a sudden.</p><br/><p>\u201cAllow me to verify something. Do you understand what you ought to do, as Holy King?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. In order to make this a country worthy of Ainz-sama, I must make it prosperous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, just so. However, you must keep the people unhappy. After all, dissatisfaction is the best spice to welcome a new king.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes,\u201c Doppel-Caspond replied. Then he asked Demiurge about a problem that had not been described in his plan.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeaking of which, what should we do about that girl?\u201d</p><br/><p>That was all Demiurge needed to realize who Doppel-Caspond was talking about, and for the first time his smile came from the heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cI once used the word \u2018unfathomable\u2019 to describe Ainz-sama\u2026 indeed, that is the case. Ainz-sama has prepared an excellent pawn for me. Her existence has cut years off my plan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Doppel-Caspond had the feeling that Demiurge\u2019s eyes \u2015 he could not tell exactly where he was looking \u2015 had suddenly moved. They seemed to be looking at the wall. And over there is\u2026 on that topic Caspond remembered that it was the main gate of the capital.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhile he had said he wanted to enthrall humans to his side\u2026 to think he could actually make a girl like that in such a staunchly religious country. Although, I have no idea why he said it would be fine to kill even a girl to whom he had lent a weapon. No doubt it must have been to force her into the appropriate mental state.\u201d</p><br/><p>Demiurge seemed to be in a very good mood, and he did not seem to be telling this to anyone in particular. Caspond merely waited in silence for Demiurge to turn his attention back to himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe instruction to help that girl was truly the right answer. No, if it were Ainz-sama, he would surely be able to correct anything that I did. While he did say in the past that he planned to introduce flaws into the plan to test my adaptability, to think he had laid such cunning plans\u2026 he is truly the one who united the Supreme Beings. Every time, he shows me how inferior I am compared to him\u2026 Kuku, what a cruel master he is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Demiurge seemed profoundly moved as he shook his head, and the interior of the room was silent. Finally, Demiurge adjusted his collar, as if to bleed off the last of his excitement, and then tightened his tie.</p><br/><p>\u201cSupport anything Neia Baraja does with everything your position affords you. Do so in the name of giving thanks to Ainz-sama. That ought to further accelerate the conflict between North and South\u2026 I will soon hand you plans on what to do if someone tries to interfere with that girl. Until then, act as we have discussed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! \u2026But what will become of that girl? Do you intend to make her the next Holy King?\u201d</p><br/><p>In that case, he would need to make the appropriate preparations. That said, Demiurge had said he would be giving him exact instructions, so it would be best to do as he was told.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is not a bad idea, but it would be better to give her another mission. While there is no telling if Ainz-sama wishes to be regarded as a god, if he does intend that, then it would be better to prepare for it. The experiment of worshipping Ainz-sama as a god will surely be useful in that case.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow then, is there anything else you would like to take this chance to verify?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. It concerns that woman who is no longer necessary, Remedios Custodio. While the original plan was to have her run around as needed, would it not be better to kill her off?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, just keep her alive and let her become a scapegoat for the nobles\u2019 dissatisfaction. That was why I said she was the only one who was not to be killed during our first encounter. Transfer her to another post. Let the Vice-Captain become the Captain of the Paladin Corps and then make use of him. He can be put to meaningful work.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDeal with her when the conflict becomes evident.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Doppel-Caspond showing that he understood, Demiurge indicated that the conversation was over, and vanished with \u300cGreater Teleportation\u300d.</p><br/><p>The demon hiding in his shadow, and the Hanzo that Caspond could never defeat no matter what he tried were still at his disposal.</p><br/><p>Doppel-Caspond rose to his feet and looked outside the window again.</p><br/><p>While he could only see the courtyard, he imagined he could see the revelling people throughout the city. After that, he laughed mockingly.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2015Enjoy the taste of happiness for a while longer, my people.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

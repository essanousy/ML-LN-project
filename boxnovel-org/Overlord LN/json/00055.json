Long time no see, I am Maruyama.</span></p><br/><p><span>By the time this volume is published, it will be the end of August, when summer is at its peak. When Maruyama was young, I felt the heat receding when September came along, but that isn\u2019t so right now, it still feels hot even in mid-September. Those are just my memories from when I was young, it would be strange if nothing had changed at all.</span></p><br/><p><span>Thanks to the extra layer of clothing Maruyama wears compared to normal people, known as fat,, I once again affirm that I hate summer. I spend most of my time in an air-conditioned room in order to cool the computers down, but I still sweat a lot when I travel to my company. The smell of my swear overwhelms my cologne; this is terrible.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>That\u2019s how hot it is. Will the people who see the obi on the book shout \u201cFuwah!\u201d in amazement? They might think, </span><i><span>this must be an illusion caused by the heat of the summer</span></i><span> or something.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>However, this is the truth!</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Even Maruyama shrieked \u201cAre you for real!\u201d as the project progressed. </span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Overlord is getting an anime!!</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>I will work hard in order to produce good work; please look forward to it!</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Now then, I will endure my stomach pain as I express my gratitude.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>This time round, it is an honor for the history of lightnovels to have So-bin-sama provide his unbelievable book illustrations. You really did your best. That\u2019s how Maruyama feels, and I\u2019m sure the readers are grateful too! Let\u2019s eat out together next time! To Chord Design Studio-sama, thank you very much for doing the design as always. To the proofreader Ohaku-sama, thank you for your pointers as always.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Also, thanks to the editor, F-da-sama, who firmly corrected the half-hearted Maruyama and recommended Kyouhoku for the illustrations without hesitation.

Its depth was unknown. Nobody knew what was waiting down there, and nobody had returned alive from the two expeditions that had been sent out to investigate it.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>For the longest time, this natural barrier had protected Feoh G\u0113r from all manner of monstrous attacks. They could thwart any monsters from the west that tried to invade so long as they defended the suspension bridge which ran across the Great Rift.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Yet today, Feoh G\u0113r\u2019s garrison \u2014 the military base that stood between the Great Rift and Feoh G\u0113r \u2014 was in a whirl of shouts and confusion.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Someone tell me exactly what is going on!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>That cry came from the commander-in-chief of the Dwarven Army, a veteran of over 10 years of service.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The information coming in was garbled and contradictory, and nobody had any idea of what was happening. The only thing he could be certain about was that something had happened at the fortress which defended the Great Rift.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe most recent information we have says that the Quagoa are attacking!\u201d one of the platoon commanders said, repeating a report from the fortress.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>News like that was hardly uncommon. The Quagoa and the Dwarves were mortal enemies, and they frequently attacked in groups of hundreds. There had been more attacks during the commander-in-chief\u2019s ten years of service than he could remember, but until now all of them had been turned away at the fortress. None of them had managed to get close to the garrison, much less Feoh G\u0113r itself.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>This was because the Quagoa were a race that was strong against weapon attacks, but very weak against electrical attacks. Knowing this, they had stocked the fortress with magic items that could produce [Lightning] and comparable effects.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>[Lightning] was a spell that pierced the enemy in a straight line, and thus extremely effective against an enemy which lined itself up to attack a bridge. It could wipe out an entire wave of Quagoa in one shot, and on top of that, the Dwarves guarding that place were armed with crossbows enchanted with the ability to inflict additional electrical damage.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>In contrast, the Dwarves in the garrison were inferior in both gear and numbers. However, it was not because they did not wish to allocate military power to an important base, but because the Dwarven Army had always lacked in manpower. Thus, the fortress had to draw its defenders from their meager pool of troops, and they had to do so in numbers which would not invite censure.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Despite all this specialization against Quagoa attacks, the fortress was now in a state where they did not even have the people left to call for aid. What did that mean?</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me they were attacked by too many enemies for them to fight off! Have there been any other messages from the fortress?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNothing until now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Cold sweat poured down the commander-in-chief\u2019s back.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The words \u201cbig invasion\u201d appeared before his eyes. There had been rumors of such a thing several years ago, but even so, he had been trying his best to deceive himself, saying that there was no such thing. Yet, it was unfolding before his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The commander-in-chief pulled himself together. Now was not the time to contemplate such ghastly things.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>What was the right thing to do now?</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>A gently-sloping tunnel in the shape of a spiral led from this garrison to the fortress, and ahead of them was the capital Feoh G\u0113r. The cavern where the garrison was located at was their final defensive line, and on top of that, they had gates of mithril which were alloyed with orichalcum. They could withstand an enemy attack from the tunnel if they closed the gates.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Should they close the gates?</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>If they did so, they would not be able to send out reinforcements from here. In other words, they would be abandoning their comrades, who might be fighting for their lives at the fortress.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Still, his hesitation only lasted for a moment.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>There were less than 20 people in the fortress. There were over 100\u2019000 Dwarves in Feoh G\u0113r. There could be only one answer when one thought of which side had priority.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cClose the gates!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cRelay the orders! Close the gates!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Before the echoes faded from the air, a thrumming sound came from the earth. Slowly, the gates covered the entrance. These gates, which had not been touched except during training, were now being used for their true purpose.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSir! It\u2019s the Quagoa!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat?!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>After hearing the cry from the soldiers guarding the tunnel entrance, the commander-in-chief turned to look. He saw the disgusting form of a demihuman, foaming at the mouth, its eyes bloodshot.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Without lightning-enchanted weapons, even one of them was a formidable foe. And now, hordes of them, so many that they could not counted with both hands, were rushing at them.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>How could this be? Had the fortress really fallen? How many men had the Quagoa brought with them? Could they hold against them even if they shut the gates?</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The commander-in-chief had these and many other questions in his heart, but in the end he shook his head.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDon\u2019t let them in! Spearmen, forward!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>With great cries, the soldiers formed up into a spear line.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Even seeing this did not slow the speed of the Quagoa charge. This was because they trusted in their fur and hide to protect them against metal.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The commander-in-chief clicked his tongue. The Quagoa had made a wise choice. Their skin was such that crossbow bolts might bounce off when fired at them. The only thing a spear line could do was to hold them at bay. However, the people here had anticipated that the Quagoa would try something like this, and they had naturally taken steps against it.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cMages! Blitzkrieg!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>A third-tier area-of-effect spell, [Thunderball] and two second-tier spells, [Thunderlances] came from the balcony overlooking the spearmen, at an angle which would not hit them.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The casters of these spells were the three most powerful mages in the army.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The group running at the head of the horde was instantly slain by the [Thunderball], as one would expect of the Quagoa\u2019s bane. The Quagoa behind them stopped to avoid being hit by it as well.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>It was only for a short period, but it gave them breathing room.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The gates closed with a great </span><i><span>clang</span></i><span>. The sounds of hammering and banging filtered through from the other side of the sturdy doors.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The tense atmosphere in the air lightened somewhat. However, the commander-in-chief, the men around him, and everyone here knew that this was not over yet.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The gates were very tough. The teeth and claws of regular Quagoa would not be able to damage them. However, some Quagoa had teeth which were said to rival the hardness of mithril. While these were leader-level beings, it would not be unusual to find such entities participating in an attack like this. There was no way to rule out any problems.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDammit! If only the gate was electrified!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>That was a suggestion the commander-in-chief had made when he had first taken his position. After all, the gates alone were not reliable enough as a final line of defense. Of course, there had been various reasons for why they could not enchant the gates, such as a lack of national power, but a big part of that had been because the fortress had always managed to stop any enemy invasions. Thus, the higher-ups had the attitude that \u201cas long as the fortress holds, everything will be fine\u201d. </span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Looking around, he saw grim and dark expressions on everyone\u2019s faces.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>This was bad. If they lost their hope for the future, they would end up losing when the fighting became desperate.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The commander-in-chief decided to turn the situation around, and shouted:</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWell done! We\u2019ve ensured the city\u2019s safety! But it\u2019s not guaranteed by any means! Start setting up barricades in case the enemy breaks through the gates! Hurry up!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>New determination filled the faces of the Dwarven soldiers. The knowledge that there was still something they could do rekindled their motivation. Even a fragile hope was better than none at all.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The commander-in-chief\u2019s chief of staff stood beside him and whispered into his ear.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSir, should we bury the gate with sand and dirt?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The commander-in-chief pondered the other Dwarf\u2019s words.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>If they sealed it off completely, many Dwarves would express their disapproval.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThey have no idea what\u2019s going on.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The commander-in-chief noticed his chief of staff\u2019s expression. He had probably assumed the commander-in-chief\u2019s statement to be a reply to his question.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t mean you. I meant that lot \u2014 the Regent Council.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou\u2019re one of them too, aren\u2019t you, commander-in-chief? So that\u2019s their response to a complete lockdown? Personally, I don\u2019t think sealing it off is enough. We should abandon Feoh G\u0113r.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The commander-in-chief narrowed his eyes and dragged his chief of staff by the hand to a place where the men would not hear them. </span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>He did not want their conversation to be overheard by anyone.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou think so too?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>They had no idea how many Quagoa were on the other side of that gate.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The enemy attack had been too swift and they had been forced onto the back foot. Thus, they had lost many chances to learn about the enemy. What they were doing now was like locking themselves up and closing their eyes.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The only solid piece of data they had was that the enemy had enough fighting power to bring down the hitherto impregnable fortress, and they had to think of a way to deal with that.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Under these circumstances, and after taking their fighting power into consideration, it would be extremely difficult for the Dwarves to open the gates and beat back the enemy. The best solution might well be to abandon their capital.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen, how much time will burying it in dirt and soil buy us?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIf we collapse the cavern, we\u2019ll be able to buy a lot of time, but if we use sand and dirt alone, we\u2019ll only gain a few days at most.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat dangers will a collapse pose?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAs you know, we aren\u2019t far from Feoh G\u0113r. Although I can\u2019t really be sure without having the Tunnel Doctors check, there\u2019s a chance that it might affect the city as well. The worst case scenario is that a shortcut opens up from beyond the gates and the Quagoa pour through it and into Feoh G\u0113r\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIn other words, we need to find out right now. Then, next question. Do you think the fortress fell under sheer weight of numbers? Why didn\u2019t the people in the fortress inform us sooner?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI thought of a few possibilities. Personally, the most likely option is that the Quagoa have enlisted the help of another species.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCould it be the Frost Dragons?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The Quagoa had conquered the former Dwarven capital of Feoh Berkanan, and had taken it as their home. However, the Royal Palace at the heart of the city was ruled by a Frost Dragon.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Both parties did not have a perfectly cooperative relationship, but since they lived together, they might help each other out.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The commander-in-chief\u2019s face blanched. Frost Dragons were essentially natural disasters once they reached a certain age.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>There had originally been four Dwarven cities.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Feoh Berkanan, which had been abandoned during the attack of the Demon Gods 200 years ago.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Feoh G\u0113r of the east, which was their current capital.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Feoh Rai\u0111\u014d to the south, which had been abandoned several years ago.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>And finally, Feoh Tiwaz, to the west. </span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>This western city had been destroyed during a battle between two Frost Dragons \u2014 Olasird\u2019arc=Haylilyal and Munuinia=Ilyslym, and it was little more than tumbled ruins.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI feel that it\u2019s very likely. While I don\u2019t know what they did to induce that arrogant lot to take action, the other alternative is that they did it themselves; either they invented some kind of spell, or they found a route that bypassed the Great Rift.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cEven we Dwarves haven\u2019t found a way around the Great Rift.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cStill, how many years ago was that? Perhaps the Quagoa dug a tunnel or something as other monsters moved, or the earth\u2019s crust shifted and gave them a detour. If you think about it, they might have gone above ground too.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe Quagoa on the surface?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThere might be an individual with that ability.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The Quagoa were completely blind under the sun, so it was impossible for the Quagoa to move their forces on the surface.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>However, that was merely wishful thinking on his part.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>No, it was too late to regret it now. He had to take that into consideration when planning future strategies.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cChief of Staff, we need to consider that they might be able to travel aboveground and enhance our surface defenses accordingly. Send a few people over without compromising our defense here. We also need to get word to the Council and have them evacuate to the south.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>In addition to this garrison, the fortress in front of the Great Rift and the Council Chamber in the city itself, there was one more military base in the Dwarven city of Feoh G\u0113r.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>It was a fortress erected for the benefit of those people taller than Dwarves \u2014 humans, for example \u2014 at the exit leading to the surface. The commander-in-chief gave the order to reinforce that area and stay alert for any surface attacks.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUnderstood!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAlso, have the men prepare to bury the door. If we need the Council\u2019s permission, I\u2019ll find a way to convince them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat if the Council takes their time deliberating?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDo your best. I\u2019ll do my best too.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>That was all he could say. Of course, his plan was to push for it as hard as possible, in his position as one of the eight councillors, but if the others vetoed him, then all he could do was try as hard as he could on his own.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cReport! Report! I have a report! Where\u2019s the commander-in-chief?!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Looking toward the source of that voice, the commander-in-chief saw a Dwarven soldier mounted on a Riding Lizard.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Riding Lizards were a kind of Giant Lizard. They were large reptiles that measured three meters from head to tail. They were not very numerous, so the Dwarves raised them as mounts and used them as pack beasts for day to day work.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>However, most runners would not use them to relay a message. They were only employed in dire circumstances \u2014 when they needed to let the garrison know about the conditions on the frontline.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Unease filled the heart of the commander-in-chief.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhere\u2019s that man from?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHe should have been posted to the fortress at the surface entrance this week.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>That validated the feeling of dread in the commander-in-chief\u2019s heart. No, given the man\u2019s expression and his near-crazed tone, it was plainly obvious. Asking that much was simply because he did not want to acknowledge the reality before his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019m here! What is it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The messenger ran towards the commander-in-chief at full speed. It could not be delayed. This was something which had to be heard immediately so a course of action could be quickly determined.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The messenger fell off the Lizard\u2019s back, and shouted as he desperately tried to right himself.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCommander-in-chief! There\u2019s an emergency! Mon-monsters! There\u2019s monsters!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>He had expected it to be about Quagoa, but he quickly ruled that out. The man would not have used those words to describe Quagoa.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCalm down! We can\u2019t figure out what you\u2019re saying! What happened? Is everyone else alright?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cY-yes! There\u2019s scary monsters at the entrance! They say they want to talk about the Quagoa army headed this way!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhaaaaaaat?!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Their timing was too perfect. He could not imagine that the two events were unconnected. Could they be the bosses of the Quagoa, or the ones who helped them cross the Great Rift?</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWho, who are they? What do they look like! Chief of Staff! Gather every man who can move right now!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUnderstood!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The commander-in-chief did not even have the time to watch his panicked subordinate leave.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHow many of those monsters are there?! What are your losses?!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cY-yes! There\u2019s about 30 of them. But they don\u2019t seem to want to fight! They even said they wanted to make a deal with us, but they looked very evil, so I don\u2019t think that was their real intention. There must be some sort of scheme at work!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>How exactly did they qualify as evil? More importantly, this man had not described them yet. After being questioned again, the soldier gulped and explained,</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThey\u2019re fearsome-looking undead surrounded by an inauspicious-looking aura!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat?! The undead?!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Beings who hated the living, who sowed death in their wake, the enemies of everything that lived.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Several images appeared in the commander-in-chief\u2019s mind as he heard the word \u201cundead\u201d. For instance, Freezing Zombies, Frost Bones, and the like. However, none of those undead were powerful adversaries. This man should have known that. In that case, why was he so afraid?</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Besides, why had the undead come here? Were they here to delight in the mutual massacre of the Dwarves and Quagoa, both of which were living beings?</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cChief of Staff, are you ready yet?! Move out once you\u2019re done! We don\u2019t know what kind of undead are out there, but do not take them lightly! Don\u2019t let them underestimate us! They may not be acting haughtily, but if they look down on us, we\u2019ll be in danger!!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><b>2</b></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The group advanced, with Gondo in the lead.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Since Gondo usually travelled underground, he was not very familiar with the surface. Therefore, he had to rely on his sense of direction over the terrain when it came to moving forward. Initially, Ainz was worried about this. But after seeing Gondo advance without hesitation, he began to trust the man. Now, he had wholly entrusted the task of guidance to him.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The fact was that Gondo had no reason to deliberately lead Ainz astray now that the Quagoa were attacking the Dwarven capital. That being the case, there should be no problem having him lead the way.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Under Gondo\u2019s leadership, Aura\u2019s magical beasts moved across the snow like it was a grassy plain.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>They boasted high dexterity and great stamina, as expected of high-level magical beasts. Even in the thin air of the snowy mountains and bearing Ainz and the others on their backs, their speed did not decrease one bit. They headed north at speeds of over 100 km per hour.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>They had spotted several flying monsters during their journey, but a few threatening growls from the magical beasts scared them all away. Thanks to that, their travel time was cut to a minimum.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>In less than a day, they had reached the sole remaining Dwarven city, Feoh G\u0113r.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Ainz guided his beast over to Gondo and asked him a question.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2026Well then, Gondo. The southern city of Feoh Rai\u0111\u014d was accessed through a fissure in a cave. Is Feoh G\u0113r like that as well?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>If that was the case, they would need to search for a way in. Gondo \u2014 who had initially been frightened by his magical beast, but was now used to riding it \u2014 replied:</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUmu. Most cities where Dwarves live are like that. However, Feoh G\u0113r was designed with considerations for large-scale trade with humans, so it\u2019s slightly different from Feoh Rai\u0111\u014d. Firstly, it\u2019s easy for humans to find, and in order to minimize any discomfort for visitors, they built a huge fortress on the outside. You\u2019ll know it when you see it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Ainz looked around after hearing that, but he still could not find any trace of a structure.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou won\u2019t see it if you don\u2019t head further northeast.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Gondo\u2019s words were full of confidence. It would seem he was quite certain of where their destination was. Since he was the only one who could lead them, there was nothing Ainz could do if he was wrong, so all he could do was trust him.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>While saying \u201cIs that so,\u201d Ainz cast his [Message] spell.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The captured Quagoa had been taken to Nazarick. There, they had been questioned, and their knowledge used to supplement Gondo\u2019s report.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The Quagoa were a race that submitted to the strong, but the Quagoa of the Azellisian Mountain Range were divided into eight clans, all of whom were united under the Clan Lord. They numbered 80\u2019000 in total.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>After analyzing this information, Ainz stamped them as a race which held no charm for him.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>If he had to choose between helping the Dwarves or the Quagoa, Ainz would choose the former without hesitation.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>However, he learned that the metals which the Quagoa ate when they were young determined their strength when they matured. If he let them eat the metals of Nazarick, it could give rise to a powerful individual.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Then, he thought about the prismatic ores in the Dwarven Kingdom.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Even if he had not eaten one of the prismatic ores, perhaps this Clan Lord had reached his station by eating one of the rare metals of YGGDRASIL.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>If he was strong enough to capture, then it was worth investigating him.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i><span>I should consider taking them in if they can obey the Sorcerous Kingdom, even though I\u2019m not confident about feeding 80\u2019000 people. After all, that\u2019s the sort of country I want.</span></i></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The country Ainz wanted.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>It was a nation where many races lived in harmony under his rule. It was a nation which reproduced the image one had of the guild Ainz Ooal Gown. </span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>It was a nation where his friends, wherever they were, could live and smile.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>That being the case, he ought to show these Quagoa some mercy.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i><span>Still, if they swear their loyalty to me, where should I put them? This mountain is a little sparse\u2026 what about the mountain range to the south of E-Rantel? But there might be residents there too\u2026 Umu, what a pain. The Lizardmen have the same technology level as them. Perhaps my experience in ruling them could be put to use. It might be a good idea to let Cocytus handle them.</span></i></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>After thinking this far, Ainz considered the opposite side of the coin.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i><span>What if they don\u2019t bend the knee? Shall I rule them by force? Shall I exterminate them? Or should I kill all the adults and use the children for experiments? Is forcing them into one clan and then ruling over them the best way?</span></i></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>As he considered various matters, Gondo\u2019s shout interrupted Ainz\u2019s train of thought.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOver there!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Ainz looked where Gondo was pointing, and sure enough, there was something which looked like a fortress built up against the side of the mountain.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The group headed straight for it. While there were many ways to conceal themselves, there was no point in doing so, and thus they proceeded directly and openly.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>As they closed the distance to the fortress, the defenders at the fortress spotted them, and the sentries came to life.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Much like what he would do before a sales pitch, Ainz inspected his clothing, and made sure his robe was neat and tidy. Of course, it was a magic item and could not get torn or wrinkled, but his memories as Suzuki Satoru told him that he should check anyway.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>After they approached the fortress, the Dwarves cocked their crossbows and took aim from the windows.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The only people who might be lethally wounded by the bolts were Gondo and Zenberu.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>While he had thought of sending them to negotiate to prove that they had no hostile intentions, they might end up being shot by bolts if things went wrong, so he abandoned that idea. Instead, Ainz would proceed first, while Gondo and Zenberu would show up later.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>He halted his beast outside the effective range of their crossbows and then dismounted. Because he was still within the maximum range of the crossbows, he ordered Shalltear and Aura to stand by and protect Gondo and Zenberu.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>After that, all that remained was anti-player strategies.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>If there were any players, they would immediately take a defensive stance and fall back. While he could not confirm the presence or absence of players during his talks with Gondo on the road, it was more likely that they did not exist. However, if he was careless, he might end up losing the NPCs (the children) and Ainz did not want to experience that a second time.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>All the Dwarves watching him from the window had the same frozen expression on their faces. Thanks to their messy beards, he could not differentiate one individual Dwarf from another, but how should he put this \u2014 they looked comical.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Suppressing the urge to laugh, Ainz stepped forward, faking an air of calm.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>His hands were raised, to show that he had no hostile intent.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>As he drew closer to the fortress\u2014</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHold it right there!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u2014A warning cry rang out. It sounded like its owner was having a seizure. Granted, he was undead, but Ainz could not help sighing internally as he mused, </span><i><span>this is a pretty bad reception for someone who\u2019s showing no signs of hostility.</span></i></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhy have you come here, undead!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Ainz stroked his shiny cheekbones. </span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI am the Sorcerer King Ainz Ooal Gown of the Sorcerous Kingdom, and I have come to forge a friendly relationship with the Dwarven nation. We will not attack you if you do not attack us, so please lower your weapons.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Confusion appeared in the eyes of the Dwarves watching from the windows. Ainz took this chance to continue speaking:</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAfter capturing the Quagoa who invaded Feoh Rai\u0111\u014d, I learned of their plans to attack this place. If you have no faith in your strength of arms, then I \u2014 my Kingdom \u2014 will gladly render assistance. Yes, that\u2019s right \u2014 it will be a good show of friendship.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>He smiled, but because he had no skin, the benevolence of his gesture did not carry over to the opposite side.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat about that Dwarf behind you? Is he a hostage?!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>It would seem the Dwarves were still wary of him.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHow rude. I </span><i><span>am</span></i><span> a king, you know? Is that any way to talk to a king?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The Dwarves looked at each other, and then one of them responded.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo, no\u2026 hang on, show us some proof that you\u2019re really a king!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2014-I see. That does make sense,\u201d Ainz agreed. \u201cThen, allow me to introduce him. He is one of you, Gondo the smith, whom I met in Feoh Rai\u0111\u014d.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Ainz showed off the kingly movements he had been taking great pains to practice.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>With the air of a natural-born leader, he gestured to his subordinate to step forward.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>A deep sense of satisfaction filled Ainz as he heard the stifled gasps of awe coming from the Dwarves. It would seem his long hours of practice had not gone to waste.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Now that Gondo was here, Ainz \u2014 who was in a good mood \u2014 showed off another pose of a gracious king and yielded the floor to him.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSorry, but can you enter the fortress and explain the situation to them in detail?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUmu, leave it to me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Gondo advanced to the fortress gates and requested permission to enter, but the gates did not open.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2026What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe something happened?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2026 Is, is that really him?! Is that really Gondo the Weirdo? Maybe someone used magic to take his face!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Ainz frowned as he heard the Dwarves\u2019 voices. Staying alert was very important, and even Ainz approved of it. Still, they would not be able to make any progress if nobody trusted them.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>However, he had heard something about the possibility of meeting an acquaintance here. If that was the case, they would be very fortunate.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI say, Gondo, can you prove yourself to them by showing your knowledge of this city? Like say, where you live, something that only a person who lived in this city would know?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOh, ohhh, yes\u2026 I\u2019ll tell that guy\u2019s wife his secret. Ah, there\u2019s a restaurant called the Black Gold Beard Pavilion! It\u2019s run by a guy whose face looks like an anvil. His food tastes terrible, and the only decent thing there is the stew!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The Dwarves fell silent. Ainz looked at Gondo, somewhat lost for words. His reply seemed like he was trying too hard.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIdiot! That place isn\u2019t for eating, but for drinking! Their stout tastes best!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cLiar! It\u2019s the red mushroom beer that\u2019s the most delicious!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat are you saying, their cloudy wine is the best! Just imagine that bubbly fragrance!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>(TL Note: </span><span>\u308a \u2013</span><span> nigorizake)</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNone of you know what real beer tastes like! Bearded Lady\u2019s the best!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Ainz made a mental note that the Dwarves liked their beer a lot, and then replied to them:</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHow about it? Can you accept that this is the real Gondo? Speaking of which, all we wanted to do was inform you that the Quagoa are trying to circle around the Great Rift and attack this city. All you have to do is send our warning to the people at the top. This way, our country will have discharged its duty, even if the Quagoa attack is a fierce one. It would be quite upsetting if you chastised us afterwards.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Several Dwarves pulled their heads back from the windows.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Some time passed. It would seem several people were having a discussion.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWait there! We\u2019ll send a report to our commander-in-chief!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>According to Gondo, that person was the highest appointment holder in this country\u2019s military.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>It would seem they realised that this had to go to their highest authority.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKukuku~\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Ainz did not suppress his chuckling.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>There was a clattering noise, and when Ainz glanced towards its source, he saw that Dwarves had trained their crossbows on him once more. Their breathing was ragged; they seemed to be in the grip of powerful emotions.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i><span>Crap. Are they angry because I laughed?</span></i></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cForgive me. In any event, is it all right if only Gondo enters? He\u2019s proven his origins, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo, he can\u2019t, no, it\u2019s not allowed, stay there! Wait there!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>He had not been laughing at them, but it would seem he had upset them all the same.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Ainz\u2019s strong emotions were suppressed, but small emotional ripples could sneak by.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>How would a company react if a salesman whom they had never met before before smiled at them as though he had something to hide? Ainz was annoyed at himself for not thinking about that. It had resulted in a mistake.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i><span>I should be more careful,</span></i><span> Ainz thought as he backed away together with Gondo.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>And so they stood there for some time.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i><span>When Jircniv came to visit, I provided refreshments, furniture and made all sorts of preparations to welcome them. Don\u2019t the Dwarves do things like that? \u2026No, the circumstances now are different from back then.</span></i></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>In contrast to Jircniv\u2019s prearranged visit, Ainz was essentially a cold-calling door-to-door salesman. He should be grateful that they had not chased him away on the spot.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>In addition, he would not be able to enjoy any drinks they gave him, considering his body.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i><span>Still, we did give the Dwarves very valuable information. I was hoping for an appropriate response. Well, I can use that as fodder for negotiation during official diplomatic relations. I\u2019ll bear with it for now.</span></i></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Still, it would probably be better to change and avoid giving offense.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>First, he took out a fake Staff of Ainz Ooal Gown. It was a perfect cosmetic copy, down to the metal used in its construction. However, that was all; it did not possess even a tenth of the power of the original, and it was merely socketed with jewels that had the same color as the original.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Ainz imbued the staff with a red glow, which quickly darkened. Why did it have such an adjustment function? His past companions\u2019 obsession filled him with irritation.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>It did not seem to be linked to his own aura.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Ainz radiated a black halo from behind him, but as expected, the staff\u2019s aura did not change.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i><span>Is it just a visual effect?</span></i></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>There was a sudden clatter, which snapped Ainz out of his thoughts. When he turned to look at the source of the sound, he saw three Dwarves seated on the ground.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>They looked like the Dwarves manning the fortress, but at the same time they seemed more impressive. In truth, two of them were better-dressed than the other. That one must have been a soldier in this fortress, and the other two would probably be his superiors.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i><span>\u2026Why are the three of them sitting there? Is sitting down to talk the proper etiquette amongst Dwarves? \u2026They\u2019re staring at me with eyes wide open. It would be annoying if it\u2019s a Dwarf-only expression.</span></i></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Their mouths were hidden by their beards, so it was difficult to see the looks they had on their faces.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Baffled, Ainz nevertheless extended a hand to the seated Dwarfs.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>One could take that as the intention to help them up, or that he wanted to shake hands. But in truth, he wanted to tell them that he would rather talk while standing.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>It was hard adjusting to different cultures. If he handled this poorly, the other side might take offense.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>If they attacked him with something like, </span><i><span>\u201cYou should have done some research on our country\u2019s customs since you wanted to form a relationship with us\u201d</span></i><span>, he would have nothing to say in response.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Though he was very uneasy about this, Ainz gave thanks to his unmoving face, and kept his hand extended.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The Dwarves glanced back and forth between Ainz\u2019s face and hands, a troubled look on their faces.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i><span>Hm? Could it be that they\u2019re afraid of me?! \u2026Well, given that I look like this\u2026 it can\u2019t be helped, right? Reactions like this are kind of expected from humanoid society\u2026</span></i></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Although they feared him in E-Rantel as well, they had not reacted in this way. Therefore, it might be that taking the hand of a highly-placed person was impolite in their society.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>In the end, the worried Ainz decided to pull them up by the hand.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i><span>Since they have the time to waste on this pointless business, it should mean that the Quagoa haven\u2019t attacked yet. If they did attack, we could have them owe us a big one, but just warning them about it would count as a small favor, so I should bear with it. Ahhh, what a shame. Still, which one of them is their leader?</span></i></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWell then, I am the Sorcerer-King Ainz Ooal Gown. Are you the gentlemen who are in charge of welcoming me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>He did not know which of the higher-ups was of higher rank, so he addressed the space between them. Then one of the Dwarves nodded forcefully, like he was trying to shake something off his face.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAhem! I, I am the man in charge of the military\u2014\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe military\u2014 I see.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>So this was the commander-in-chief. Ainz was surprised. He had not expected their top man to come down in person.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i><span>Could it be that this country has heard of the Sorcerous Kingdom before? Or rather\u2026 was it because I brought them news at a very opportune time?</span></i></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2014Are there any problems with the Quagoa? I do apologize for making you come down in person during a busy time, commander-in-chief.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The commander-in-chief\u2019s eyes went wide.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI see\u2026 so you already know why I came, then?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i><span>What the hell is he talking about,</span></i><span> Ainz thought. Naturally, he did not actually say it.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2014Of course. That is correct.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>He nodded magnanimously, in the regal manner he had practiced many times before.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2026I see. \u2026Well, as you know, we\u2019ve somehow halted the Quagoa advance for now \u2014 no, we\u2019re trying to hold them back.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHo. Hoho. \u2026And?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Ainz wanted to ask the Dwarf what he thought Ainz knew, but since Ainz had already pretended that he was well-informed, that line of questioning was ruled out. </span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i><span>But has anything leaked out about me? </span></i></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>All he could do was hang on to that thought as he looked forward to their response.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBefore that, I heard from my men that you obtained your information after questioning some Quagoa captured in Feoh Rai\u0111\u014d. Do you have any evidence to support it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThere is Gondo, a citizen of this country\u2014\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2014</span><i><span>Material</span></i><span> evidence.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHm, so, you want to see the captured Quagoa, then? I can bring forth several of them and you can ask them yourselves.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAn immediate answer\u2026 It seems I will have to be frank with you, then. \u2026At this rate, an evacuation to Feoh Rai\u0111\u014d will be very difficult.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCommander\u2026!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Judging by the reproachful tone taken by the man beside the commander-in-chief, Ainz guessed that the man was harping on the fact that the commander-in-chief was talking about military secrets in front of Ainz. However the commander-in-chief calmly continued:</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHis Majesty already knows everything. It is as he said \u2014 the fact that someone who should be commanding at the frontlines is here is a clear sign of a stalemate. Since he already knows that, it should also be easy to imagine what our troops \u2014 who cannot look forward to any reinforcements \u2014 intend to do.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i><span>No, I was just asking to be polite.</span></i><span> However, Ainz could not speak the truth, and instead he nodded, in the practiced manner of a true ruler.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The commander-in-chief described the terrible state they were in. </span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The fortress defending the Great Rift had fallen, and they had been pushed back to their final defensive line. Only one gate stood between them and the enemy, and if it fell, the foe would pour into the city and many Dwarves would die. While they had originally planned to buy some time for people to flee to Feoh Rai\u0111\u014d, it was clear that the survival of the entire species would be in doubt if the plan was not radically altered.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>After Ainz learned of the Dwarves\u2019 dire straits, he smiled in his heart. Everything was developing in a favorable direction for him.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHow about this? I will lend you the use of my forces to beat back the Quagoa for the time being. What do you think?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The commander narrowed his eyes, as though to hide the emotion within them.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCan you do that? But\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Traditionally speaking, one would need to put down the terms of a deal in writing before a contract could be signed. There were many advantages in handling matters in that way. However, if he freely lent them his strength, he would earn the gratitude of everyone present. One could make gains with a loan that one could not with a written agreement, and Ainz was gunning for that.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Between the fixed and the formless, the formless was generally more troublesome. It was like paying for a meal at a restaurant based on one\u2019s mood. There was the chance that one would be overcharged compared to paying a fixed price.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i><span>Generosity is often similar to greed, hm? Did Punitto Moe-san say that?</span></i></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAfter coming all this way and taking so much effort to find you, it would be quite troublesome for me if the country I wished to befriend was destroyed. Won\u2019t you accept my help?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2026But if we don\u2019t have the approval of the Council\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWell, as long as there\u2019s enough time, it should be alright. This is simply an offer of assistance from me. The final decision is yours. Of course, the Council should settle important things in session\u2026 but you should know how this sort of thing usually ends up. Meetings go on from dawn to dusk and in the end nobody can come to a conclusion. While it would be a shame to let my journey up to now go to waste, it can\u2019t be helped.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2026Your Majesty, are you confident in your ability to repulse the Quagoa?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIf they are only of the calibre that we saw in Feoh Rai\u0111\u014d, then it should be child\u2019s play.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i><span>Mm,</span></i><span> Gondo nodded from the side.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOf course, that is before the Quagoa break into the city. It is very difficult to eliminate only the enemy during a chaotic melee. I trust you wouldn\u2019t want to stand by and let the fighting spill over into the Dwarven city? So I think that right now, your one little door is your last chance, right?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>A bitter expression came over the commander-in-chief\u2019s face\u2014</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2014How much longer do you have? How many more days can the gate hold out?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Ainz\u2019s repeated hammering on the point seemed to have made up the commander-in-chief\u2019s mind for him.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2026I understand. Your Majesty, I pray you will lend us your nation\u2019s strength.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCommander-in-chief!\u201d</span><span></span></p><br/><p>\n</p></div>"}

If one listened closely, one could hear the faint sounds of work in progress coming from the distance.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Once they entered the room, the hitherto silent Victim suddenly spoke to Ainz:</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cEmoh gniog m\u2019I ,syug uoy wercs. (Then, I shall take my leave now, Ainz-sama.)\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThank you for your hard work. Please take care of Nazarick\u2019s First Floor for me before we get back.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKek esiarp. (Understood.)\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u300cGate\u300d.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Victim passed through the door of darkness which Ainz had conjured. It led to the First Floor of the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick.</span></p><br/><p><span>After watching that Guardian \u2014 whose death would activate a powerful movement restriction skill \u2014 leave through the \u300cGate\u300d, Ainz turned back to the rest of the room. At the same time, he sensed Aura behind him, her head bowed.</span></p><br/><p><span>It would seem she had done her best to pretty the room up to welcome Ainz. It was quite moving to see the signs of her hard work that could be seen in every corner of the room. However, this room was far plainer than Nazarick. Perhaps Aura felt ashamed of that.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>It\u2019s not like it\u2019s that bad\u2026</span></i></p><br/><p><span>Ainz had originally been a plebeian, so he did not really mind. While his room as the master of Nazarick was not a bad thing, sometimes excessive luxury made him feel uncomfortable. He could relax a little in this place, so it was pretty good.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>I want an eight tatami room. Maybe I should secretly set one up somewhere. Ah, I need to reward my subordinates. I need to tell Aura that I\u2019m pleased with her hard work.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>People had to thank and rely on others for their hard work in order to succeed.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ainz remembered when he had been running an errand at a certain company, and had overheard something from the director\u2019s room. He did not know who had said it, but it was a truly wonderful line. It made him think that it was how an ideal superior should be.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>You need to express the gratitude in your heart. If you don\u2019t praise your people, they won\u2019t work\u2026 something like that?</span></i></p><br/><p><span>\u201cForgive me for keeping you here, Aura. I am not displeased in the slightest. I am very satisfied with your hard work, and it is the equivalent of Nazarick because you decorated it for me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Aura\u2019s eyes widened slightly. Ainz did not know if that counted as comforting her, but he was out of ideas. All he could do was try and bluff his way through by looking around.</span></p><br/><p><span>The room still smelled of wood.</span></p><br/><p><span>Under normal circumstances, it would have been better to return to Nazarick than stay in this nearly indefensible place. That was because without the application of defensive spells, this location was little more than a house of papier-mache. On the other hand, this was a very good spot to use oneself as bait to lure out a big fish.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was quite far from the lake, so anyone who could pursue them here \u2014 if there were any \u2014 would probably be an YGGDRASIL player or people of comparable power to them.</span></p><br/><p><span>In other words, this place had been built to take the attack of a powerful opponent.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was dangerous, of course. But Ainz felt that one could not seize the tiger\u2019s cubs without entering its den.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>So they still haven\u2019t come. Or is it that\u2026 this operation failed as well? Still\u2026 what </span></i><span>is </span><i><span>that?</span></i></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2026Aura, a question for you. What is that thing over there?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ainz\u2019s gaze fell on a white-colored chair within the room. It had a high back and looked very solid. Due to the exquisite craftsmanship that had gone into its construction, it easily qualified as a work of art. Well, as long as one did not dwell on its sole fault.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is a little plain, but it is a throne that was specially made for you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>One of the subordinates behind him \u2014 Demiurge \u2014 confidently responded on Aura\u2019s behalf. Having anticipated that, Ainz continued asking:</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2026And whose bones went into its construction?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThey came from all sorts of animals. I selected choice bones from Griffins and Wyverns.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2026I see\u2026 Is that so\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>This throne of bone was not furniture from Nazarick, so it was probably something Demiurge had made outside before bringing it here. Also, the throne\u2019s construction seemed to use a lot of human or demihuman bones. While it was not stained with blood or flesh and was completely made out of pure white bones, he still imagined that he could smell the gore.</span></p><br/><p><span>Slightly revulsed, Ainz hesitated over whether or not to take a seat on it. However, it would be hard to simply ignore a chair which had been specially made for him. That said, if he had a good reason, it would be a different matter\u2014</span></p><br/><p><span>Ainz thought about the matter, and then he suddenly brought his hands together.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2026Shalltear, I believe I said I would punish you earlier? I shall now mete it out. Yes\u2026 I shall humiliate you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Shalltear seemed a little startled at having been mentioned.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKneel there and lower your head. Get on your hands and knees.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Confused, Shalltear went to the place Ainz indicated \u2014 the center of the room \u2014 before getting into a supplicatory position.</span></p><br/><p><span>After moving to Shalltear\u2019s side, Ainz immediately sat upon her slender back.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2014Ai-Ainz-sama!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Shalltear\u2019s off-key cry of surprise come out as something like \u201cHeinzsh-sama.\u201d She seemed panicked, but she remained still, because Ainz was seated on her back.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou are here to be my chair, understand?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ainz turned from the abnormally happy Shalltear to look at Demiurge.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2014Forgive me, Demiurge. That\u2019s how it is.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI see! How remarkable! To think you would sit upon a Guardian! Indeed, that is a chair which nobody can make \u2014 in other words, a proper seat for a Supreme Being. Ainz-sama, you have surpassed my expectations once more, as is befitting of yourself!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIs, is that so\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Demiurge was beaming as he radiated his loyalty to his master. Ainz had no idea why he was smiling so brightly and turned away uneasily. Then, a beautiful woman who was all smiles addressed Ainz.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cForgive me, Ainz-sama, may I be excused for a moment? I will be back soon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Albedo? Never mind, it\u2019s all right. Go, then.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>After thanking Ainz, Albedo left the room. After that, there was a feminine voice going \u201cDORYAAAAA\u2014!\u201d from outside the room, followed by a tremendous impact against the wall, which made the house shake violently.</span></p><br/><p><span>About a minute later, Albedo returned to the silent room, with her usual gentle smile on her face.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019m back, Ainz-sama. Oh yes, Aura, I accidentally bumped into the wall on my way out, and there seems to be some damage. Could you fix it later? Sorry about that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAh, er, all right\u2026 okay~ I\u2019ll go fix it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ainz sighed, swallowing a lot of the things he wanted to say. He recalled his gaze that had nearly drifted away and focused it on the staff which radiated an evil aura.</span></p><br/><p><span>Obviously, he would not bring the true Staff of Ainz Ooal Gown to such a dangerous place. This was an experimental specimen that had been built in imitation of the Guild Weapon. After fitting it with magic items used for special effects testing in the Treasury, it looked almost like the real thing, and it made for a good decoy.</span></p><br/><p><span>The guild would disband if the Guild Weapon was destroyed. Therefore, he could not casually carry it with him. It was currently in the care of the Guardian of the Sakura Sanctuary on the Eighth Floor.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>I\u2019ve considered countermeasures against the Ring being stolen as well, but I just can\u2019t find a place where I can conduct the experiment\u2026</span></i></p><br/><p><span>As Ainz thought about this, Shalltear\u2019s body suddenly twitched. That movement seemed like an adjustment so Ainz could sit more comfortably. A bizarre sense of unease drove Ainz to look at the back of Shalltear\u2019s head.</span></p><br/><p><span>She was panting.</span></p><br/><p><span>He was probably too heavy for her. Shalltear\u2019s back that he sat upon was about as slender as that of a fourteen year old girl\u2019s and it was quite slender. To think an adult would be sitting on such a slender back. Ainz was deeply convinced that he was a shamelessly cruel pervert, and had gone too far.</span></p><br/><p><span>Shalltear was an NPC made by one of his friends from the past, Peroroncino. In all likelihood, he had not expected Shalltear would have ended up being tormented like this. Since this was essentially an action which cast shame upon his former comrades, Ainz believed that this was a form of punishment for himself as well. However, he now realized that he was foolish for having thought so.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>To think I\u2019m actually torturing Shalltear like this\u2026 I\u2019m beyond saving.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>\u201cShalltear, is it uncomfortable?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><i><span>If it is, then I\u2019ll stop it</span></i><span> \u2014 just as Ainz was about to say that, Shalltear looked back, staring at Ainz. Her face was flushed, and her eyes burned brightly.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNot at all! In fact, I feel this is practically a reward!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Every word she spoke carried the heat brewing within her body, and her glazed eyes reflected Ainz\u2019s face. Her bright red tongue licked at her lips, leaving a seductive sheen. The way her body writhed ever so slightly was reminiscent of a snake.</span></p><br/><p><span>There was no mistaking this for anything other than carnal desire.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2026Uwah\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It made him want to run away.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ainz almost stood up.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>I can\u2019t, how could I do that?</span></i></p><br/><p><span>This was a punishment for Shalltear, and Shalltear\u2019s mistake had been because of Ainz\u2019s miscalculation. Therefore, resisting the urge to stand up was also a way of punishing himself.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ainz crushed the rising tide of complex emotions within him.</span></p><br/><p><span>He tried his best to bear with the squirming, panting chair beneath him. Even so, he could not help but wonder </span><i><span>How perverted did Peroroncino make her, anyway?</span></i></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2026Then, let\u2019s talk business. Are the Lizardmen as frightened as expected?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIndeed, Ainz-sama.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s right, just look at the Lizardmen\u2019s faces.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ainz laughed as he heard the Guardians\u2019 responses. In truth, he could hardly tell how the Lizardmen\u2019s expressions had changed. While Lizardmen looked more like humans than reptiles, their facial expressions were completely different from those of humans. </span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cReally now. Then, we can consider the first part of the impression which Cocytus is going to make a success.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ainz sighed in relief.</span></p><br/><p><span>He had expected at least that much from super tier spells, which could only be used four times a day. Ainz had gone out of his way to use one of them \u2014 \u300cThe Creation\u300d \u2014 and if that failed to impress, then all he could say was that it was sad.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen, Demiurge, when will you finish tallying the information on how far the lake was frozen?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWe are still gathering the relevant data, but the radius of freezing was larger than expected, which presents some difficulties. If possible, I hope we might be given a bit more time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ainz reached out to stop Demiurge from kneeling, and then cupped his jaw with a skeletal hand, before settling into contemplation. It would seem the spell\u2019s effective radius had been larger than he imagined, but as a magical experiment, it was quite a success.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u300cThe Creation\u300d was a super tier spell that could change terrain special effects. In YGGDRASIL, one would use it to ward off the heat in hot regions or to suppress the freezing chill of icy areas.</span></p><br/><p><span>In truth, he could have awed them into submission without using a super tier spell.</span></p><br/><p><span>However, he had used it anyway because he wanted to conduct an experiment on how large a spell\u2019s radius could be. In YGGDRASIL, \u300cThe Creation\u300d could affect quite a large area, and when they tested it in Nazarick, it managed to cover the whole of the Eighth Floor. However, they did not know how it would fare outdoors.</span></p><br/><p><span>In YGGDRASIL, it could cover one area, but he wanted to know how large that zone was in this world. It would be too much if he cast it on a plain and it covered the entire plain.</span></p><br/><p><span>Similarly, it would be too much if it covered the entire lake. It would seem he had to be very careful when using super tier magic.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen, Aura, what about our security net?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes! We\u2019ve dispatched the undead we borrowed from you to patrol within a two kilometer radius, but we haven\u2019t picked up any exceptional intrusions. Also, I\u2019ve sent out some of my magical beasts who are adept at reconnaissance to patrol a four kilometer radius around us, but there haven\u2019t been reports of anything suspicious so far.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIs that so\u2026 Our foe might make their approach by some perfectly undetectable means. Have you prepared against that yet?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine. Shalltear was helping me out, so we\u2019ve also deployed undead which are good at surveillance.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cVery good.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Aura was all smiles after Ainz\u2019s praise. Her previous depression was nowhere to be seen.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cStill, has the person who used the World Class Item on Shalltear still not made a move even after we\u2019ve exposed ourselves like this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>All eyes were on Ainz as he asked that question again, but he was not directing it at anyone in particular.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhy isn\u2019t the opposition spying on this place and Nazarick?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCould it be that the enemy is keeping an eye on us with a World Class Item which renders him immune to regular surveillance?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ainz tilted his head in confusion after Demiurge answered with his question.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2026I used Momon because I thought they might use such means\u2026 if the enemy uses World Class Items to spy on us, they won\u2019t be able to observe Momon, since he also possesses a World Class Item. Therefore, I\u2019ve been operating on the assumption that they\u2019ll be using physical or direct observation\u2026 well, it might be magical too, but in short, I\u2019ve been assuming that they\u2019ll use more conventional methods to keep an eye on us\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ainz sensed that the Guardians around him seemed puzzled, and he realised that his explanation was not sufficiently clear.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWell\u2026 how shall I put this\u2026 in the past, we once owned a mine that produced a rare metal. The price went through the roof because we monopolized it, so a group of people schemed to steal it from us. Back then, our opposition used \u300c\u03bf\u1f50\u03c1\u03bf\u03b2\u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2\u300d. That was one of the World Class Items known as The Twenty.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>(TL Note: Ouroboros)</span></p><br/><p><span>Ainz narrowed his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>He had been furious when the mine had been stolen away, but thinking back on it now, it was a good memory. It held true even as he recalled how they had been hunted and lost quite a few rare pieces of gear.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat!? Someone actually dared seize territory which had been claimed by the Supreme Beings? Unforgivable! Please order us to retake it at once!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ainz hurriedly shifted his gaze as he heard Albedo vent her anger.</span></p><br/><p><span>He saw all the Guardians seething with hostility and murderous intent. Even the ever-serene Demiurge had a savage expression on his face. That was not all; Ainz could glimpse the determination to take it back on Mare\u2019s shy and retiring face. </span></p><br/><p><span>Incidentally, Ainz could not see Shalltear\u2019s expression on account of her being a chair, but he could feel her body tense up, sending her iron will travelling up through his rump.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCalm down! That\u2019s in the past.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ainz raised a hand to order the Guardians to cool their heads. While it looked as though they had somewhat regained their composure, they still seemed unstable, as though magma were flowing beneath the surface. Ainz decided to pick up the previous topic to change the subject.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOur enemy used \u300c\u03bf\u1f50\u03c1\u03bf\u03b2\u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2\u300d and made it impossible for us to enter the world where the mine was. They probably used that time to search for and find the mine. Once the seal was broken and we could enter the world, we found that the mine had already been taken.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They had fought recklessly to retake the mine and a great deal of the guild members had died at least once, but Ainz resisted the urge to speak of that.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen, this is the point I wanted to make. While I said the world was sealed, people with World Class items could still enter that world during that time. Therefore, it should be impossible for them to spot us even if they use World Class Items for surveillance.</span></p><br/><p><span>As Ainz listened to the gasps of enlightenment from his subordinates, he wondered if that was really the case. </span></p><br/><p><span>It was very likely, but there was no proof that they could not be found.</span></p><br/><p><span>When \u300cFive Element Progression\u300d \u2014 one of the Twenty, just like \u300c\u03bf\u1f50\u03c1\u03bf\u03b2\u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2\u300d \u2014 had been used, the game company sent a message to all World Class Item holders. In addition to an apology, they also included an item as compensation. The apology went: \u201cDear holders of World Class Items, you should not have been affected by changes in the world, but we have learned that keeping your data unaffected will be a very difficult task for the system. Therefore, we are making a special exception and changing your data as well.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Therefore, he could not conclude that it was a perfect defense. Still, that incident had been a special case.</span></p><br/><p><span>In particular, one of the World Class Items defending Nazarick had the effect of protecting against divination spells. If it could not block surveillance from World Class Items, then it would be meaningless.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cTherefore, I feel the enemy will try to approach Momon\u2026 but the ones who have come to him are all mothers clutching their newborn children or adventurers.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The ones who came forward begged him to touch their children\u2019s heads in the hope that they would grow up strong, or they asked to shake hands with him in the hopes of becoming stronger themselves. None of them had asked to speak with him in private.</span></p><br/><p><span>Therefore, Ainz had created many openings like this on purpose, waiting for the enemy to make a move.</span></p><br/><p><span>Not giving Cocytus a World Class Item was part of that plan. Ainz intended to use him as bait to draw out the opposition. Their foe was fearsome precisely because he did not know their identity. That being the case, learning about their opponent would probably help them find a way to deal with them.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cMay I share my humble opinion on this matter?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat is it, Albedo?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAinz-sama, as you have said just now, your aim is to divine the enemy\u2019s identity and learn more about them. In that case, is it not possible that the enemy is unwilling to get close because they have not been exposed yet?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><i><span>\u2026Ah.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt\u2026 it\u2019s fine, Albedo. I have considered that point as well.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>As if. Ainz had already assumed that his enemy was like himself, and would want to learn about their opposition.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>\u2026What a gaffe. What if I\u2019ve been going about it all wrong from the start?</span></i></p><br/><p><span>\u201cForgive me. Also\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Albedo, could you please stop</span></i><span> \u2014 Ainz could not bring himself to beg that of her. He felt like he had finished a multiple choice exam, and then, when he went through his work one more time, he found that all his answers were incorrectly shifted one space down.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThere\u2019s the matter of announcing that Shalltear was defeated by a magic item\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes. I reported as much to the Guild. That was in order to avoid people fearing Momon\u2019s strength. Spell-sealing crystals are extremely rare items, so breaking one for an experiment should be difficult. Therefore, saying that the spell-sealing crystal went out of control \u2014 that the monster was defeated through the use of a magic item \u2014 is more convincing and it means fewer people will be on guard against Momon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIndeed, it is as you say. It would work well against people who think spell-sealing crystals are rare items.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Albedo\u2019s subtle qualification of her statement made Ainz feel very uneasy.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2026However, what if our enemy had multiple such crystals like yourself, Ainz-sama?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2026Hm? Ah, so that\u2019s what you mean.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ainz put on a show of sudden realization, but he had no idea what she meant.</span></p><br/><p><span>So what if the opposition had many spell-sealing crystals? The fact was that they were very valuable items in this world. Was Albedo worried that someone would break a crystal as an experiment?</span></p><br/><p><span>Still, it did not feel like that.</span></p><br/><p><span>A sense of foreboding filled Ainz\u2019s heart. He wanted Albedo to explain herself, but he resented having the pretense of knowledge he had put on just now.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Come to think of it, is it really all right if I act as a ruler and decide the direction of Nazarick? What if I end up steering us into an iceberg?</span></i></p><br/><p><span>He wanted to run away from all of this and be done with it.</span></p><br/><p><span>Unable to bear the strain of leadership \u2014 which was only amplified when he messed up \u2014 he wept within his soul.</span></p><br/><p><span>However, he could not just run off. Since he had called himself Ainz Ooal Gown, he could not abandon the things \u2014 the NPCs and the treasures of Nazarick \u2014 that his friends had made. The most important thing was that he did not want to become a deadbeat father.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>I sometimes worry if you\u2019ll betray, abandon, or give up on me. However, that just means I have to be the Ainz Ooal Gown you expect and believe in.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>Therefore, Ainz put on a confident front, the pose of a ruler with utmost confidence in himself, which he had practiced in the mirror.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. However, I understand your unease.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Then, Ainz looked around.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAlbedo\u2026 share your worries with the other Guardians.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAh, yes! If the opposition possesses multiple crystals like you do, Ainz-sama\u2026 anyone who knows their abilities will probably see through that news immediately. In other words, they will believe that Shalltear was not defeated by the crystal. Although the enemy might not know if Shalltear fought with all her strength, anyone with a World Class Item would probably think that Shalltear and Momon were of equivalent strength. Therefore, they would probably consider Momon \u2014 a mysterious warrior who suddenly appeared in E-Rantel \u2014 a threat, no? In addition, the opposition might also suspect something about the link between Shalltear and Momon\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2026Albedo, and the Guardians. What do you think the enemy will do next?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cPermit me to answer, then. I feel that if our enemy intends to oppose you, Ainz-sama, they will respond by spreading rumors of Momon and the Vampire being in league with each other \u2014 even if there is no basis to them \u2014 and lash out at him. Our opposition will surely not want Momon to become more and more famous.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Uwah,</span></i><span> Ainz groaned internally.</span></p><br/><p><span>His original aim of going to E-Rantel was to gather information, but his main objective was to make the character Momon famous \u2014 that, and he also wanted to get away from all this. The original plan was to turn Momon into a great hero and then reveal his true identity, whereupon the fame and glory he had accumulated would be transferred to Ainz Ooal Gown, and resound throughout the world.</span></p><br/><p><span>In addition, it would also serve to show that a former PK guild had changed its image, fighting injustice through the name of Momon. But now, those plans were little more than soap bubbles vanishing in the wind.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOh? Demiurge, I\u2019ve got a question. Wouldn\u2019t it be more damaging to spread the rumors of working with that Vampire </span><i><span>after</span></i><span> he became famous?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAura, doing so at that time would be a poor move. Once Ainz-sama is sufficiently famous, people would discount those rumors as malicious gossip. That reputation must be eliminated before it grows and becomes widespread.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cA very astute observation, Demiurge.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ainz nodded magnanimously in response to Demiurge\u2019s bow, as though he had been thinking the same thing as well.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen, I have another question. If that is the case, why has the enemy not spread these rumors yet?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Demiurge raised a finger after hearing Ainz\u2019s question.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cFirstly, the enemy has not completed their investigation into Momon-sama. If it turned out that Momon-sama defeated Shalltear in open combat, they would wish to avoid incurring his ire, or perhaps they would like to recruit him to their side. Secondly\u2014\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He raised another finger.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat if the opposition only ran into Shalltear by chance? Or what if they encountered her on the way to another objective, and they were a completely unrelated third party?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s not possible now, is it, Demiurge. How unlikely would that be\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ainz said that, but in his heart, he realized that it was not impossible.</span></p><br/><p><span>He was dead set on the idea that this was an attack targeted at Shalltear \u2014 or the personnel of the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick. However, Shalltear had been attacked shortly after they had all been brought to this new world. Under those circumstances, it would require preternatural precision to target and attack Shalltear.</span></p><br/><p><span>Was he being overly paranoid of some hidden mastermind?</span></p><br/><p><span>Ainz narrowed his eyes \u2014 the points of red light in his eye sockets.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ultimately, the lack of information remained a problem. He did not have enough manpower and he needed more strength.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>In any case, the biggest problem right now is our lack of an intelligence-gathering network.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>Currently, he had ordered Sebas to handle this sort of work. However, there was a limit to how much intelligence that limited numbers of intelligence personnel could gather. At first, he had only wanted to learn the basic facts of this world, but they were now at a stage where such information was no longer sufficient.</span></p><br/><p><span>They could not learn what they wanted to know by going through adventurers and traders alone. It was similar to how an average citizen and a high ranking government official had access to information of differing importance.</span></p><br/><p><span>In addition, he had no idea what sort of person could analyze the data they had gathered and determine whether or not any particular piece of information was important.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGood grief. In any case, our main challenge now is a lack of information. Our hands are tied because we have to be wary of an unseen foe\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Demiurge flashed Ainz a conspiratorial smile as he heard Ainz mumble.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIn that case, why not seek a nation to support you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>After a brief silence, Albedo went \u201cOh\u201d to indicate that she understood. Soon, Ainz made the same noise.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI see, Demiurge. So that was what you meant.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>However, the other three Guardians still looked quite confused. After that, Aura came out and asked:</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAinz-sama, what\u2019s this all about?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>As Aura asked that question, Ainz gave thanks that he did not have any facial expressions.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHonestly\u2026 Mare, Shalltear, do you not understand what Demiurge was trying to say?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span></span></p><br/><p><span>The two of them shook their heads in unison.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI see. Then it can\u2019t be helped. Tell them, Demiurge.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes, I understand. Now then, everyone. Ainz-sama is worried about the existence of a hidden, powerful enemy. I feel that if we encounter said enemy and they are hostile to us, we need to have some kind of leverage that we can use during negotiations.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Sensei, I don\u2019t get it</span></i><span> \u2014 that look appeared on the faces of three students and one adult. Demiurge-sensei seemed to realise that his explanation was too complicated and decided to continue explaining after dumbing himself down to match the students.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat would you do if Ainz-sama was dominated by some World Class Item?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019d kill the bastard who did it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2026No, that\u2019s not what I mean, Aura. What I\u2019m trying to say is, don\u2019t you think the very fact that being mind controlled would count as an alibi? The fact is that there are people out there who really can dominate their opposition with World Class Items, so we can convincingly say that Ainz-sama was controlled by a World Class Item.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Assistant Teacher Albedo supplemented Head Teacher Demiurge\u2019s lecture:</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIn other words, by pretending to support another country, we have an excuse for any action which Nazarick takes. By saying that we were ordered to do so by that country and we had no choice but to obey, we could use that to deflect blame from ourselves, assuming there was an enemy on our level. Also, if the other party does not want an open conflict, they will have no choice but to bear with it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI see\u2026 so even if someone wasn\u2019t happy with what we did, as long as we had a good reason, we could drag a third party into becoming an ally\u2026 so that\u2019s what it is, as expected of Ainz-sama\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ainz reached out and stroked the head of Shalltear the chair. It was like a mob boss stroking a Siamese cat</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDemiurge came up with that scheme, not me, so your thanks should go to him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not true. It would seem you already came to the same answer, Ainz-sama.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAh, er\u2026 um. It feels like I\u2019m taking credit for your hard work. Sorry about that. Also\u2026 I believe it will be easier to obtain information if we support another country.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>A country would probably have the intelligence-gathering network that they were struggling to build. That being the case, infiltrating them with Nazarick\u2019s people ought to be much better for gathering usable information.</span></p><br/><p><span>Demiurge smiled at the thought that his suggestion had been useful on something which had bothered Ainz, and at Ainz\u2019s words, which seemed to validate his and Albedo\u2019s opinions.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIndeed.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ainz was aware of the subtext: </span><i><span>\u201cYou picked up on it as well, Ainz-sama.\u201d</span></i></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAh, indeed. As expected of Ainz-sama \u2014 to think you had such clear insights\u2026 in that case, even inferior lifeforms like human beings could prove surprisingly useful.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>After Albedo spoke up, the other Guardians \u2014 including Shalltear the chair \u2014 looked at Ainz with sparkly eyes filled with pure loyalty.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ainz felt very uncomfortable, but he consoled himself with the fact that the two of them had given him their approval.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen\u2026 let\u2019s find a country to infiltrate. Which country will it be?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIf we pick from the neighboring countries, we would have the Kingdom, the Empire, and the Theocracy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHow, how about a country that was further away? Like say, the Council Alliance or the Holy Kingdom\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI would rather not select a distant country, and I would prefer not to make contact with the Theocracy before we learn enough about them. That leaves the Kingdom and the Empire\u2026 judging by Sebas\u2019s report, the Kingdom is not particularly interesting. However\u2026 this matter requires further study. Anyway\u2014\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ainz interrupted the conversation by extending his hand to the mirror.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWe\u2019ve given the Lizardmen some time. Let\u2019s see if they\u2019ve done anything unexpected.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>A bird\u2019s eye view of the Lizardmen\u2019s village appeared on the Mirror of Remote Viewing.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ainz reached out to the mirror and with a subtle shift of his hand, he changed the scenery it showed.</span></p><br/><p><span>Naturally, he began by zooming in the image.</span></p><br/><p><span>In this way, they could see every detail of the Lizardmen\u2019s preparations for battle.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSuch futile effort,\u201d Demiurge muttered gently to the Lizardmen.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Let\u2019s see, where are they? It\u2019s hard to tell one Lizardman from another.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>Ainz frowned as he searched for the six Lizardmen he had seen earlier.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOh \u2014 there\u2019s the armor. Is this the rock-throwing fellow? And then, the one with the greatsword is here. The differences are really fine. Maybe color, gear, or obvious physical variations would be good ways to tell them apart\u2026 ah, there\u2019s a distinctive one.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>After that, Ainz moved the mirror\u2019s image around in confusion.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t see that white Lizardman and the one with a magic weapon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHm\u2026 is his name Zaryusu?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAh, that\u2019s right, that\u2019s his name.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>After Aura reminded him, Ainz remembered the name of the Lizardman who had stepped forward to negotiate with him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCould he be in his house?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The Mirror of Remote Viewing could not peer into structures. However, that was only under normal circumstances.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDemiurge, fetch me the Infinite Haversack.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>With a bow, Demiurge picked up the Infinite Backpack which lay on the table which had been shifted to the corner of the room before courteously presenting it to Ainz. Ainz took a scroll out of it.</span></p><br/><p><span>After that, he cast the spell inscribed within it.</span></p><br/><p><span>The spell produced an invisible and incorporeal sensor. It could not penetrate magical barriers, but it could pass through conventional walls regardless of their thickness. If it could not pass through said walls, that would imply there was a powerful foe present, and they had to be wary.</span></p><br/><p><span>He linked the sensor to the Mirror of Remote Viewing, so the Guardians could see what Ainz could see. Then he moved the eye-like, floating sensor.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cLet\u2019s see what\u2019s inside this house.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ainz selected one of the nearest houses \u2014 a pretty run-down affair \u2014 and sent the sensor inside. Despite the darkness of the interior, it appeared as bright as day through the eyes of the sensor.</span></p><br/><p><span>The white Lizardman was pressed against the floor of the house. Her tail was tucked up and there was a black Lizardman mounted on her.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ainz was utterly confused.</span></p><br/><p><span>For a moment, he had no idea what was going on. In the next moment, he had no idea why they would be doing something like that at a time like this.</span></p><br/><p><span>After that, Ainz silently steered the sensor outside.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ainz grabbed his head in a moment of infinite weakness. The Guardians around him had no idea what to say, and looked at the ground with puzzled expressions on their faces.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2014What a displeasing lot. Cocytus will be attacking any moment now and they\u2019re still indulging themselves!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cExactly!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cEr, ah, a-about that\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDemiurge\u2019s right! We need to make those two suffer!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019m so jealous\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ainz waved his hand to silence the Guardians.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2026Forget it, they\u2019ll all be dead soon. I once saw a movie which said that situations like these stimulate the desire to propagate the species.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ainz nodded, certain of his opinion.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIndeed, it is so!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWell, if that\u2019s all, we should probably let them off the hook.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cExactly!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cEr, ah, a-about that\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI agree with Demiurge-sama\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2026Quiet, all of you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>After the Guardians had fallen silent, Ainz sighed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2026Well, there goes my motivation. Never mind, there\u2019s probably nobody to worry about in the Lizardman village. Still, we can\u2019t be careless, because someone might be heading for us right now. Aura\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ainz froze, and looked at the twins.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Crap! What should I do now!? Those two haven\u2019t been given sex education yet\u2026 no, it\u2019s too early for that!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>Ainz suddenly understood what it was like for a father to see a lewd scene on the television during a family gathering.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Dammit, how would a father or mother answer if they were asked where babies came from!? This is bad! I can\u2019t believe I let Bukubukuchagama\u2019s children see that \u2014 though, it shouldn\u2019t be too bad. Let\u2019s not consider Albedo, and Demiurge\u2026 he\u2019d probably teach them from a clinical perspective. Shalltear\u2026 not too bad either. Let\u2019s handle this another day.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>After pushing the question to the back of his mind, Ainz coughed and asked:</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIf the security net picks up anything, all the Guardians \u2014 myself included \u2014 will move out together.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>If there were any other players around, he would not adhere to his agreement of sparing the Lizardmen. If they would not become allies, then they would have to be terminated with extreme prejudice to avoid any information leaks. When they happened, they would destroy the village, even if they had to draw on all the forces of the Eighth Floor to do so.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ainz thrust aside the guilt he felt at violating his promise to Cocytus. A little white lie would be preferable if it was for a good reason.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2026Now then, the show\u2019s about to begin\u2026 let\u2019s enjoy watching Cocytus in action.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><b>Part 2</b></p><br/><p><span>The four hours passed in a flash.</span></p><br/><p><span>The frozen marsh had long since melted, and the warriors were gathered there \u2014 at the main gate of the village. After the intense battle several days ago, there were precious few of them who had survived to fight in this battle.</span></p><br/><p><span>There were three hundred and sixteen of them in total.</span></p><br/><p><span>Nobody but the warriors would participate in this battle, because Shasuryu had said, \u201cThe enemy is few in number, so too many people on our part will just get in the way.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>That seemed like a logical enough explanation, but that was not all.</span></p><br/><p><span>Zaryusu stood some distance ahead of the Lizardmen and looked on the warriors.</span></p><br/><p><span>Everyone was painted with markings which showed that the ancestors had descended upon them. Their iron will was readily apparent on their faces, and they looked confident of victory.</span></p><br/><p><span>The Lizardmen around them were cheering their warriors on. Still, he could see quite a few worried-looking people in the crowd.</span></p><br/><p><span>Zaryusu strove to keep a nonchalant expression in order to keep his uneasiness from showing on his face. He did not want the other Lizardmen to know that this battle was essentially a live sacrifice to the king of death.</span></p><br/><p><span>Indeed, this was a battle that was intended to demonstrate the undead king\u2019s power to the Lizardmen. Its purpose was to thoroughly eradicate the very possibility of rebellion among the Lizardmen. They had no chance of surviving, which meant that the subtext behind Shasuryu\u2019s words was \u201cso that we can reduce casualties to the minimum.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Zaryusu looked away from the Lizardmen, and he turned his keen gaze on the enemy formation.</span></p><br/><p><span>The skeletal army remained where it was. There was no sign of the monster called Cocytus among them. Zaryusu doubted that it was a skeleton. As a trusted subordinate of that king of death, how could he be a mook like that? He must be some being whose strength was apparent at a glance.</span></p><br/><p><span>A loud splashing came from behind the worried Zaryusu\u2014</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2014Hey, Zaryusu.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2014And Zenberu greeted him as casually as always. He was the same person even when he was headed for certain death.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cMorale\u2019s at its peak.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWell, it would be nice if it could stay that way when we faced that Cocytus fellow\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYup. Oh, is it time?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Shasuryu was at the main gate, and all the Lizardmen\u2019s eyes were on the two Swamp Elementals by his side.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crusch was not here because she had spent all her mana on summoning the elementals. The drain of that, on top of casting a plethora of long-duration defensive spells on Zaryusu, had left her almost immobile. In fact, when they had left their house, Crusch had already told him that she would be passing out from using too much mana, and they would never see each other again.</span></p><br/><p><span>Alone now, Zaryusu looked towards the place where Crusch was. The way she had looked when they had parted made Zaryusu feel like he had been stabbed in the heart.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWarriors, let\u2019s go!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>With a rousing cry, Shasuryu stoked the flames of the Lizardmen\u2019s fighting spirit, and the air was filled with eager tension.</span></p><br/><p><span>He had to think like a warrior again. Zaryusu reined in his rampaging thoughts.</span></p><br/><p><span>The Lizardmen advanced slowly, led by Shasuryu and the two Swamp Elementals.</span></p><br/><p><span>They were leaving the village so it would not be caught up in the fighting.</span></p><br/><p><span>Zaryusu and Zenberu followed behind them.</span></p><br/><p><span>Just then, Zaryusu suddenly looked back to the village. There were the broken-down dirt walls, the worried Lizardmen watching them go, and\u2014</span></p><br/><p><span>Zaryusu sighed quietly, and cast all his worries away as he strode forward. He did not speak the name of the female which was on his lips.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2666 \u2666 \u2666</span></p><br/><p><span>The Lizardmen marched into the marsh, and formed up at the region between the skeletal army and the village.</span></p><br/><p><span>That said, they had no formation to speak of. They simply sprawled themselves out to wait for the fight. At their head were the various tribal chiefs and the two Swamp Elementals.</span></p><br/><p><span>The skeletal army had probably been waiting for their arrival. They banged on their shields and stomped.</span></p><br/><p><span>The many small delays between footfalls would normally make an army\u2019s march sound like a shower of bird droppings. However, the undead army marched with perfect coordination, producing a harmonious sound. If the circumstances were any different, it would be worthy of applause.</span></p><br/><p><span>Just as the Lizardmen were drawn in by the sound of their movements, several trees fell \u2014 behind the skeletal army.</span></p><br/><p><span>There was only one reason why those gigantic trees would fall \u2014 because someone had cut them down.</span></p><br/><p><span>This sparked a commotion among the Lizardmen.</span></p><br/><p><span>Since nobody was visible yet, it was reasonable to assume that several people had worked together to fell those trees. However, if that were the case, then the trees were falling with far too much uniformity. Granted, after seeing the unity of the skeletal army, an observer might think that they could chop down trees with such precision, but none of the Lizardmen felt that way.</span></p><br/><p><span>A bizarre thought ran through their minds \u2014 that all this had been done by one person.</span></p><br/><p><span>That was because there was no sound of blades striking wood before the trees fell. In other words, it might be possible (however surprising it was) that some incredibly strong person had chopped the trees down with one swing.</span></p><br/><p><span>How strong an arm and how mighty a weapon would be needed to cut a massive tree in half with a single stroke?</span></p><br/><p><span>The earthshaking tremors of the falling trees blended with the sound of the skeletons pounding on their shields, and both crept closer to the Lizardmen.</span></p><br/><p><span>Anxiety began to brew. That was only to be expected \u2014 who could remain calm under such circumstances? Even Zenberu \u2014 who was prepared to die \u2014 was shaken, though he tried to hide it.</span></p><br/><p><span>Soon, the creature which had cleaved a path through the forest finally appeared. At the same time, the pounding on the shields suddenly stopped.</span></p><br/><p><span>In the preternatural silence, the first thing they saw was a mass of glossy blue light. How much more brightly would it have shone had the sky not been overcast?</span></p><br/><p><span>It looked like a two-legged insect, its massive body standing around two hundred fifty centimeters high. It resembled an ant or a mantis, and it looked like some hybrid made by an utterly depraved fiend.</span></p><br/><p><span>Its hard exoskeleton was wreathed in freezing cold, and it glittered like diamond dust.</span></p><br/><p><span>It had a savage tail that was as long as its body and studded with countless spikes. Its mighty jaws looked like they could easily bite a man\u2019s hands clean off. </span></p><br/><p><span>It had four arms tipped in razor-sharp claws, each of which was sheathed in a shiny gauntlet. It wore a disc-like amulet on a golden necklace and platinum rings around its ankles.</span></p><br/><p><span>This was how the being of matchless might, follower of the king of death, made its entrance.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2666 \u2666 \u2666</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Was he Cocytus?</span></i></p><br/><p><span>Zaryusu\u2019s heart pounded. Unconsciously, his breathing had grown faster.</span></p><br/><p><span>None of the Lizardmen spoke. Everyone\u2019s attention was drawn to the monster that had shown itself, and they were so frightened that they could not tear their eyes away. </span></p><br/><p><span>They had begun backing away slowly without realizing it. Be they Lizardman warriors who had come in high spirits, or Zaryusu and the others who had come here prepared to die, all of them were shocked to the core by the appearance of this unimaginably powerful entity.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>I know the king of death didn\u2019t use his full strength on us, but even so, I didn\u2019t expect the warrior he sent to fight in earnest to be so frightening.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>Even with a spell that removed his fear, the impulse to run away still surged within Zaryusu\u2019s heart. It was a miracle that the warriors, who were not protected by such magic, were not already trampling each other as they fled.</span></p><br/><p><span>Cocytus slowly drew closer.</span></p><br/><p><span>He strode proudly into the marsh, past the skeletal army\u2014</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2014And then Cocytus stopped, roughly thirty meters away from the Lizardmen. After that, his insectoid face swivelled atop his slender neck, as though looking for someone.</span></p><br/><p><span>Zaryusu had the feeling that Cocytus\u2019s eyes were on him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2014All right. Since. Ainz-sama. Is. Watching. I Shall. Ensure. You. Get. A. Chance. To. Shine. However. Before. That. \u300cIce Pillar\u300d.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>As the spell activated, two pillars of ice erupted from the water between the Lizardmen and Cocytus, about twenty meters apart.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis. Might. Be. Rude. To. Warriors. Who. Are. Ready. To. Give. Their. Lives. But. I. Must. Inform. You. That. My. Side. Of. These. Pillars. Will. Be. Your. Grave. Any. Who. Cross. It. Shall. Die.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Cocytus folded his arms, as though to say, </span><i><span>The choice is yours.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOi oi oi, he doesn\u2019t look like it but he\u2019s a pretty decent chap, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Zaryusu nodded deeply at Zenberu\u2019s words.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then, he stepped forward. Zenberu and the other two chiefs followed him.</span></p><br/><p><span>Shasuryu looked back, at the warriors who were about to follow him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou should stay here\u2026 no, return to the village. Otherwise\u2026 you\u2019ll die with us.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat!? We want to fight too! It\u2019s scary, but\u2026 even if it\u2019s scary, we still want to fight!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cRetreat is not cowardice. Living is true courage.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen\u2014\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThere\u2019s some of us who can\u2019t fall back either. Besides, as chiefs, we can\u2019t accept other people ruling us without a fight, no?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWe still want to fight, Chief.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHold on a second! Get out of here, young ones! This is a job for us old folks!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The Lizardmen who shoved their way forward were all advanced in years, but none of them was old enough to be considered elderly. There were fifty seven of them, and none of the others could say anything after seeing their faces.</span></p><br/><p><span>Perhaps if they looked like they were resolved to die or had given up on themselves, they would have asked to come along. However, their expressions were a plea for the younger Lizardmen to live on and celebrate the miracle of life.</span></p><br/><p><span>With nothing left to say, the rest of the warriors turned back.</span></p><br/><p><span>Shasuryu turned to face Cocytus once more.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2026Sorry for the wait, Cocytus.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Cocytus extended a hand to the Lizardmen and curled it towards him. </span><i><span>\u201cBring it,\u201d</span></i><span> the gesture seemed to say. In response to this taunt, Shasuryu shouted:</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCHARGE\u2014!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOhhhhh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Fully resolved to die, the Lizardmen gave voice to a cry from the depths of their souls, a roar which seemed to split the very sky, and rushed at Cocytus.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Cocytus calmly regarded the warriors charging him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2026This. Might. Be. A. Bit. Disrespectful. To. Warriors. Like. You. But. I. Shall. Cull. Your. Numbers.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Cocytus was sure that he would not be defeated even if all of the warriors reached him, but still, he had to weed his opponents out.</span></p><br/><p><span>Personally speaking, Cocytus would have liked to allow his foes to reach a range where they could fight. However, he had received far more largesse than he deserved, and allowing this ragtag band of misfits to do battle with a Guardian of the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick would be disrespectful to Ainz-sama.</span></p><br/><p><span>Thus, he unleashed his aura.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a skill derived from the Knight of Niflheim class \u2014 \u300cFrost Aura\u300d. This special ability damaged and slowed the foe through the use of extreme cold temperatures. At full power, it could even engulf the Lizardmen spectating from the sides.</span></p><br/><p><span>So he had to suppress its power.</span></p><br/><p><span>He had to narrow its radius and reduce its damage.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis ought to do it\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>A wave of freezing cold expanded from Cocytus, instantly filling a radius of twenty five meters across.</span></p><br/><p><span>The temperature plummeted upon exposure to the intense cold, and the very air seemed to groan.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2026Hm. That. Ought. To. Do.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He drew back his aura.</span></p><br/><p><span>The momentary exposure meant that the savage, blizzard like snap-frost had vanished like it had never been. However, it was no illusion or trick of the senses. The best proof of that was the fifty seven Lizardman corpses that covered the marsh.</span></p><br/><p><span>Only five more still remained. However, they were the five strongest Lizardmen. Unfazed by Cocytus\u2019s might or the deaths of their comrades, they moved out as one.</span></p><br/><p><span>A stone flew through the air. The armored Lizardman led the charge, followed by two more behind it. In addition, the two Swamp Elementals had cracks all over them after the cold attack, and lagged behind the Lizardmen because they were slower. The one at the rear incanted spell after spell.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2666 \u2666 \u2666</span></p><br/><p><span>The first strike was a stone, which was aimed at Cocytus\u2019s throat. However, it was completely meaningless, because\u2014</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2014We. Guardians. Are. Equipped. With. Items. That. Resist. Ranged. Attacks.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2014An invisible barrier which appeared to cover his body deflected the stone.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was followed by a charging Lizardman. The armor he wore was an ancestral heirloom, one of the Four Treasures \u2014 the White Dragon Bone. It was strong enough to deflect Frost Pain, itself one of the Four Treasures, and it was hailed as the hardest armor among the Lizardmen.</span></p><br/><p><span>Facing it was a sword which Cocytus drew out of nothing, as though it had been sheathed in the air.</span></p><br/><p><span>The sword Cocytus unsheathed was an odachi \u2014 its blade over one hundred eighty centimeters long, named God-Slaying Slash Emperor. It was the sharpest of the twenty one weapons which Cocytus possessed.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then, he swung it at the incoming Lizardman.</span></p><br/><p><span>The fluid cut whooshed quietly through the air. If not for the present situation, it would have been a sound which people would want to listen for.</span></p><br/><p><span>After that sound, the chief\u2019s body and his armor split into two halves from head to tail, which fell to the left and right, into the marsh.</span></p><br/><p><span>God-Slaying Slash Emperor was unscathed despite cleaving through the strongest armor of the Lizardmen.</span></p><br/><p><span>The other two Lizardmen did not seem affected by the death of their comrade. They raised their weapons and executed a pincer attack.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYeeart!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>On the right, Zenberu sent a karate chop at Cocytus\u2019s face, having enhanced it with \u300cIron Natural Weapon\u300d and \u300cIron Skin\u300d. </span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGuooooh\u2014!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>On the left was Frost Pain, stabbing at the belly.</span></p><br/><p><span>This attack was calculated to exploit the fact that long weapons were unwieldy in melee combat.</span></p><br/><p><span>Of course, that only applied to regular people.</span></p><br/><p><span>Cocytus shifted slightly and intercepted Zenberu\u2019s arm with the blade of God-Slaying Slash Emperor. His preternatural movements made it seem as though the weapon in his hand was an extension of his limbs.</span></p><br/><p><span>Zenberu\u2019s skin could rival the hardness of steel under the effects of Iron Skin, but the armor from just now had already proven the sharpness of God-Slaying Slash Emperor.</span></p><br/><p><span>The blade which entered Zenberu\u2019s arm carved it off like it was going through water.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGuwaaargh\u2014!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>As Zenberu\u2019s severed right arm sprayed fresh arterial blood, Cocytus\u2019s other hand casually gripped Frost Pain, which was headed at his belly.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2014Oh. I. See. This. Is. A. Pretty. Good. Sword.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWaaah!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Zaryusu gave up on pulling back the immovable Frost Pain, and immediately lashed out at Cocytus\u2019s knee with a kick. Cocytus did not dodge it; he simply took the blow. In the end, when Zaryusu\u2019s foot connected with Cocytus\u2019s knee, it was Zaryusu who felt the pain.</span></p><br/><p><span>It felt just like kicking an iron wall with all his might.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u300cOver Magic \u2013 Mass Light Cure Wounds\u300d.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Through the use of prodigious amounts of mana, one could forcibly cast a spell that should not have been normally usable. Aided by this metamagic enhancement, Shasuryu cast a spell that healed everyone\u2019s wounds.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Cocytus looked at Shasuryu with interest as the latter used a metamagic technique he had never heard of before. However, the two Swamp Elementals blocked his line of sight. While Zenberu\u2019s arm gradually resumed its original form, the two Swamp Elementals attacked Cocytus with their tentacles. However, Cocytus had already slashed at the Swamp Elementals\u2019 bodies.</span></p><br/><p><span>Just as the the Swamp Elementals dissolved into clumps of mud, Zaryusu punched at Cocytus\u2019s compound eyes, his belly, and his chest. Naturally, it was Zaryusu who was hurt instead. The skin on his knuckles split and wept tears of fresh blood.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHow. Bothersome.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Cocytus swatted at Zaryusu\u2019s chest with his spiked tail.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2666 \u2666 \u2666</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGuaargh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Zaryusu flew into the distance like he had been hit by a baseball bat, accompanied by the sound of cracking. In the end, he hit the marsh, rolling several times before coming to a halt. However, the agony in his chest and the bright red blood he was coughing up made it hard for Zaryusu to breathe.</span></p><br/><p><span>The broken ribs had probably pierced his lungs, because he could not take air in no matter how hard he tried to breathe. It felt as though he were in water. The hot fluid pouring into his throat made him want to vomit. He looked down at his chest, and the wound \u2014 which looked like someone had stabbed him with a sharp blade \u2014 was gushing with blood.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2014-Just one hit had reduced Zaryusu to this pitiful state.</span></p><br/><p><span>Zaryusu glared at Cocytus, the fighting spirit still burning in his eyes even as he struggled to keep breathing.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSo. You. Still. Wish. To. Fight. Then. I. Shall. Return. This. To. You.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>After casually tossing Frost Pain back to the fallen Zaryusu, Cocytus ignored him and turned to the remaining Lizardmen.</span></p><br/><p><span>Shasuryu cast a healing spell on Zenberu, who had regrown his arm, but whose health had been greatly depleted.</span></p><br/><p><span>Just as Cocytus was about to reach them, another stone flew at him, attempting to divert his attention \u2014 however, the attack was useless, and was easily deflected.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2014How. Annoying,\u201d Cocytus grumbled, and then extended his hand at the Small Fang\u2019s chief.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u300cPiercing Icicle\u300d.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Several dozen razor-sharp icicles, each the size of an arm, showered down on a large area.</span></p><br/><p><span>One of the Lizardmen was within the attack radius and the icicles pierced him instantly.</span></p><br/><p><span>He took one in the chest, two in the belly, and one in the right thigh \u2014 each of them easily penetrated his body</span></p><br/><p><span>The Small Fang chief \u2014 the best ranger among the Lizardmen, crumpled to the swamp like a puppet whose strings had been cut, where he expired.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUoooooh\u2014!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u300cOver Magic \u2013 Mass Light Cure Wounds\u300d!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Zenberu charged ahead while Shasuryu cast a healing spell again. Zenberu was trying to buy time for Zaryusu\u2019s wounds to mend.</span></p><br/><p><span>He knew this was a reckless course of action, and that he was nothing before the might of Cocytus. Even so, Zenberu sprinted ahead without a moment\u2019s hesitation.</span></p><br/><p><span>Cocytus swung lightly at Zenberu, who had entered his attack range.</span></p><br/><p><span>The swing was faster than Zenberu could see\u2014</span></p><br/><p><span>Its speed was beyond Zenberu\u2019s dexterity\u2014</span></p><br/><p><span>The blade sheared easily through Zenberu\u2019s flesh\u2014</span></p><br/><p><span>The decapitated corpse of Zenberu spurted blood like a geyser as it collapsed gently to the marshlands. Shortly after that, his head joined it on the sod.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2026Now. Only. The. Two. Of. You. Are. Left\u2026 I. Had. Heard. Of. Your. Strength. From. Ainz-sama. But. In. The. End. Only. The. Two. Of. You. Remained.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Cocytus \u2014 who had not moved so much as an inch since the battle had started \u2014 studied the two of them, and flicked his sword. There was no trace of blood or fat on the gleaming white blade. That beautiful movement looked like it could sweep everything away in a single stroke.</span></p><br/><p><span></span></p><br/><p><span>Facing it was Zaryusu, who had recovered to the point where he could barely stand, and Shasuryu, who had drawn his greatsword. The two of them flanked Cocytus front and rear. Zaryusu dabbed his fingers in the blood flowing from his chest and smeared it on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span>The way he applied the blood to himself made it seem as though he was summoning the ancestral spirits down upon himself.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2014Zaryusu, how are your wounds?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNot good. It\u2019s still aching. Still, I can take a few more swings.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cReally now\u2026 that should be enough, right? Frankly speaking, I\u2019m almost out of mana. If I\u2019m not careful, I might keel over.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Shasuryu\u2019s teeth ground against each other. Perhaps he was laughing. As Zaryusu heard this, his expression changed as well.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2026Oh, really? Ani-ja, you\u2019re pushing yourself pretty hard too.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Zaryusu smiled, and then he sighed, relaxing his shoulders. His sword arm sagged.</span></p><br/><p><span>A torrent of pain erupted from near his chest, but Zaryusu fought to ignore it.</span></p><br/><p><span>He would not give up until the last moment \u2014 Zaryusu intended to fight until the end.</span></p><br/><p><span>From the beginning, he had known full well that victory was impossible.</span></p><br/><p><span>Defeat was unavoidable, yet they could not accept it.</span></p><br/><p><span>That was because it would be like lying to countless people, telling them that they could win. Since others had actually believed them, they could not accept the fact that they would be defeated.</span></p><br/><p><span>They had to give everything they had until the final moment\u2014</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen swing that sword you\u2019re wielding!!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Zaryusu\u2019s cry echoed throughout the surrounding area.</span></p><br/><p><span>The sound of clacking came from Cocytus\u2019s mandibles.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cA. Fine. Cry.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Cocytus was probably laughing. But this was not the laughter of the strong mocking the weak, but a warrior laughing with a fellow fighter.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cVery well, Zaryusu. That\u2019s it, then. I\u2019ll fight with you to the bitter end as well.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Shasuryu smiled as well.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen\u2026 Sorry to keep you waiting, Cocytus-dono.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Cocytus shrugged as Shasuryu said this.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt. Is. Fine. I. Am. Not. So. Thoughtless. As. To. Interrupt. A. Farewell. Between. Brothers. Now. Prepare. To Meet. Your. Fate\u2026 No. Pardon. Me. You. Were. Ready. For. It. From. The. Start.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>As Zaryusu and Shasuryu began moving, Cocytus flourished God-Slaying Slash Emperor and asked:</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cState. Your. Names.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cShasuryu Shasha.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201dZaryusu Shasha.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2026I. Will. Remember. You. Warriors. Also. I.

One of them was for Albedo and another was for her luggage. One of the remaining coaches contained gifts to the King, to impress upon them the difference between the might of the Kingdom and the Sorcerous Kingdom. Surrounding these carriages were 20 Death Cavaliers which Ainz had created.</p><br/><p>It would have been simple enough to just teleport to the Kingdom, but they had not chosen to do so.</p><br/><p>Albedo and her party were responsible for demonstrating the Sorcerous Kingdom\u2019s power. Part of that was using monsters in place of horses to pull their coaches; an implied threat, so to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, Ainz-sama, please take care of yourself for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUmu, be careful. We haven\u2019t found the people who brainwashed Shalltear yet. Thus we cannot rule out the possibility that they might seek to control you, and then use you as part of a great gamble to inflict massive damage on Nazarick.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. I will be careful and never let this leave my person.\u201d</p><br/><p>Albedo was hugging a World-Class Item to her breast.</p><br/><p>\u201cI believe possessing that should eliminate the risk of being brainwashed by a World-Class Item. However, the opposition might not be limited to just that item. In addition, while that is the most powerful World-Class Item against physical objects, don\u2019t forget that it is not very useful against individual targets.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so? My main weapon is the transformed version of this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s weaker than a specialized divine-class item. Even so, it\u2019s still quite strong in that it will never be destroyed or damaged. All I want to say is, don\u2019t be careless because you\u2019re strong. Although I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll make a mistake like that\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Come to think of it, Albedo had never been outside until now.</p><br/><p>He had stationed her in Nazarick and had her serve as a rear guard. Because of this, Ainz felt worried, as though he was letting a child go out on an errand by themselves for the first time.</p><br/><p>\u201cRemain alert and do not be careless. If you feel there is danger, retreat immediately. Do you have any teleportation items? Some of them need time to take effect, so does yours work immediately? Some enemies can also impede teleportation before attacking, have you thought of a way to deal with them? There might also be enemies who distract you with bait before ambushing you. Don\u2019t be fooled by your enemies\u2019 strength, alright? Although I\u2019ve heard you\u2019ve gone through combat training in order to improve your flexibility, you still need to study up a bit more. In addition\u2015\u201d</p><br/><p>He thought, <i>it would have been good if I had lectured Shalltear like this</i> while he thought about the tactics he would use for PKing. As he did so, he sprayed Albedo with a stream of words at machine-gun speed.</p><br/><p>How long had he spent on thinking up all kinds of attacks? Ainz only returned to normal after he realised Albedo was looking at him with a delighted expression on her face.</p><br/><p>This was terribly embarrassing.</p><br/><p>Ainz coughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, something like that. I believe that you of all people, Albedo, will not slack off on preparations and countermeasures. I\u2019m sorry for delaying you. Take care when you travel.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood, Ainz-sama.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough it might not be appropriate to ask right before you go, about Demiurge \u2015 no, never mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe should be fine, I believe?\u201d</p><br/><p>If he had received some communication from Demiurge, he would not have a huge pile of questions to ask him. For instance, Albedo had not opposed the formation of the Adventurer\u2019s Guild, but it might be better to ask him in person when he returned. Albedo seemed surprised, but after she realised that Ainz did not intend to reply, she resumed her usual gentle expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, Ainz-sama. As the Guardian Overseer, I will show you results which will not bring shame upon the office.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour actions have never insulted your station.\u201d</p><br/><p>Granted, right after that he recalled Albedo mounting him cowgirl-style, but that was not the sort of thing one could bring up at this juncture.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is one more thing I have to say. While you are immune to disease, this world might possess illnesses that can bypass even that immunity, so be careful. I\u2019ve heard that it\u2019s exceptionally easy to fall ill at the turn of the season.\u201d</p><br/><p>The transition between the four seasons was not very clear in Suzuki Satoru\u2019s world.</p><br/><p>A thought struck him \u2015 what would Blue Planet do if he were here? He would probably have the same sparkly-eyed expression that Albedo did. \u2026Although, whether he could actually make that expression was a different matter entirely.</p><br/><p>Then, Albedo volunteered a suggestion, with a look on her face like a freshly-bloomed flower:</p><br/><p>\u201cAinz-sama! I, I know of a remedy that works very well against illness!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHoh\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>That was quite a surprise. He had not expected her to know of medication which was unique to this world.</p><br/><p>Nfirea the herbalist should not have come into contact with Albedo. That being the case, could it have come from knowledge within YGGDRASIL, or perhaps something Tabula Smaragdina programmed into her? His curiosity now aroused, Ainz looked forward to what she would say next.</p><br/><p>\u201cA kiss!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026A kiss?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, kissing relieves stress and activates the parasympathetic nervous system. Once the efficiency of the parasympathetic nervous system increases, the performance of the immune system improves with it. In other words, if you get kissed, you won\u2019t get sick!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat you\u2019ve said sounds kind of familiar\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He recalled someone mentioning something about the parasympathetic nervous system while he was playing YGGDRASIL. That must be it. However, he did not feel that it would be effective in this world too.</p><br/><p>\u201cTherefore, I want a kiss~\u201d</p><br/><p>Albedo closed her eyes and puckered her lips.</p><br/><p>All he could see now was an octopus.</p><br/><p>That description might sound like it was slandering a great beauty, but the truth was, her looks had not been greatly diminished. After all, a beautiful woman remained beautiful no matter what expression she had on her face.</p><br/><p>That untimely thought flashed through Anz\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>Ainz had considered running away at this point.</p><br/><p>He wanted to say, \u201cCertainly not\u201d, but it was plainly obvious that she was hoping for a kiss. In addition, this was a wish from someone who was about to run a work errand, so he wanted to help fulfil it, to a certain extent. In addition, it would make his heart ache to ignore the wishes of Tabula Smaragdina\u2019s daughter.</p><br/><p>Ainz took Albedo\u2019s chin in one hand, and planted a kiss on her cheek. That said, Ainz had no skin, and thus no lips, so the kiss Ainz gave was little more than pressing his front teeth against her. In addition, since he had no saliva, all she should have been able to feel was something dry and hard poking her.</p><br/><p>Although this was terribly embarrassing, he had to inflict himself on her.</p><br/><p><i>I\u2019m glad I brushed my teeth, even though I didn\u2019t eat anything.</i></p><br/><p>After his hand left her chin, he met Albedo\u2019s wide-eyed gaze.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, what\u2019s wrong? Besides, it would have been too much to kiss you on the lips, so the cheek will have to do. Was it not right?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I did not think you would have considered it at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Ainz could ask her about what she really meant, tears welled up in the corner of Albedo\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cFueeeen~\u201d</p><br/><p>Albedo wept. Those were not crocodile tears. She was truly crying.</p><br/><p>After the long-awaited shock of his emotional suppression washed over him, Ainz hurriedly scrambled to do something. That said, he had no idea how to proceed.</p><br/><p>In the past, when he had made Albedo cry in the Treasury, he had thought of something comforting to say. However, nothing came to mind now that Ainz had made her cry after kissing her. What would that pretty boy Emperor (Jircniv) do at a time like this? Although he thought about that topic, it would seem that none of the scenes which Ainz witnessed had ever covered a situation like that.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlbedo, please don\u2019t cry.\u201d</p><br/><p>He desperately wanted to look to the duty maid behind him for help, but he had already embarrassed himself badly enough. He could not disgrace himself even further.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlbedo, don\u2019t cry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz pulled Albedo into his embrace and gently patted her back.</p><br/><p>They stayed like this for a while, and then Albedo sniffled. It would seem her tears had stopped.</p><br/><p>Ainz released the hands holding Albedo, as relief washed through him.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you alright, Albedo?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Ainz-sama. I am very sorry for letting you see that shameful side of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Though stained with tears, hers was still a very beautiful smile.</p><br/><p>There was only one reason she could be crying.</p><br/><p>His nonexistent stomach began aching after he realized how cruel he had been. At that time, he thought it was fine, because the game was going to end soon. If only he had not thought that way, she would not have cried like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so. \u2026Well, it\u2019s about time. You should set out if you\u2019re fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood, Momonga-sama!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2666 \u2666 \u2666</p><br/><p>The curtains mounted in the coach windows opened, and through them, he saw Albedo waving to him. In response, Ainz waved back to her.</p><br/><p>This was a scene straight out of those railway train farewells one might have seen on television.</p><br/><p>The coach stirred slowly into motion, and the sentries began moving as well.</p><br/><p>Ainz watched until he could no longer see Albedo\u2019s coach, and as he stared into the distance, he issued a somber, grave command.</p><br/><p>\u201cForget everything that happened here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz walked past the maid, whose head was lowered. Ainz had no way of seeing what the kind of look she had on her face.</p><br/><p><b>Part 2</b></p><br/><p>The Bloody Emperor, Jircniv Rune Farlord El-Nix clutched at his head.</p><br/><p>This was not a recent thing. He had been doing this for quite some time now.</p><br/><p>In the past, he had purged all manner of nobles, heard about treachery which could shake the Empire, and learned of deteriorating relationships with neighboring countries. Through it all, this man had neither panicked nor fallen into confusion. However, in the face of an insoluble problem, even this man could do nothing but bitterly cradle his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit! You son of a bitch! Die! Die and rot away!\u201d</p><br/><p>While magic could curse someone to death, Jircniv did not have that kind of power. Therefore, he was simply speaking offensive words. If he could actually kill that hateful man who had wrought such devastation on his mind and his stomach lining for the past few months, he would gladly seek out such techniques.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, wait. It would be better to tell him to \u201clive\u201d, right? Or maybe, \u2018be destroyed\u2019 would be more appropriate? I\u2019ve heard of some priests destroying the undead with sacred power.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was even thinking about such meaningless things.</p><br/><p>Jircniv\u2019s stomach ached and strands of his fallen hair adorned his pillow every morning. The culprit, the man responsible for all of this was the Sorcerer King, Ainz Ooal Gown.</p><br/><p>There was no satisfactory solution to the problems posed by the Sorcerer King.</p><br/><p>The first problem concerned the casualties among the Imperial Knight Corps at the Battle of the Katze Plains.</p><br/><p>There were only 143 deaths; a trivial number, for a direct clash with the enemy. However, the losses at the Katze Plain had been entirely self-inflicted.</p><br/><p>In addition, 3,788 people had expressed their desire to leave the Knight Corps upon their return to the Imperial Capital. In other words, over 6% of the 60,000 men of the Imperial Knight Corps had lost their courage.</p><br/><p>And then, there were thousands of people who complained of uneasiness and night terrors. According to the reports, there were at least 200 mentally unstable people as well.</p><br/><p>Knights were professional warriors, and training even a single one of them entailed considerable expense.</p><br/><p>Nor was it just a matter of money. Training time was also essential. One could not simply grab somebody off the streets and say, \u201cFrom tomorrow onwards, you are a knight.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Empire would need to spend a great deal to fill the shortfall in the number of knights. But where would he get the funds for those expenditures?</p><br/><p>At this critical moment, it was too risky to purge the nobles and seize their assets to make up the required amount.</p><br/><p>The reason for that was because of the second problem \u2015 namely, the petitions which the Imperial Knights themselves had submitted to Jircniv.</p><br/><p>The Knight Corps were permitted to make proposals to Emperor Jircniv. This was because there were some things which only blooded veterans could understand, and it was also to reduce the conflicts between military officers and bureaucratic officials. At the same time, it was also to give the impression that Jircniv \u2015 who had a martial background \u2015 was especially fond of the Knight Corps.</p><br/><p>Of course, one could not expect such letters to always be positive, but the recent petitions were harsh indeed.</p><br/><p>These petitions, from the upper echelons of the Knight Corps\u2019 command structure, expressed their desire to avoid warfare with the Sorcerous Kingdom.</p><br/><p>Jircniv could understand that sort of thing even if they did not bring it up.</p><br/><p>Anyone who dared face that Kingdom in open combat would be far beyond a mere fool; he would be an absolute madman. That was a nation that could trample 200,000 enemy troops with a single spell. There was no way Jircniv would conceivably pick a fight with such a foe.</p><br/><p>Even so, the reason why the Knight Corps had tendered such a petition was because they had lost their faith in Jircniv.</p><br/><p>Before the Battle of the Katze Plains, Jircniv had proposed to the Sorcerer King: \u201cI hope you will use your strongest spell\u201d. The upper echelons of the Knight Corps knew this, and laid the blame for that miserable hellscape squarely at the feet of Jircniv.</p><br/><p>In other words, they were using him as a scapegoat.</p><br/><p>When Jircniv learned this he was both furious and frustrated in the extreme.</p><br/><p>If he had known that such magic existed, he would never have said such a thing.</p><br/><p>Besides, the reason why Jircniv had asked that damnable Sorcerer King to use his strongest spell was to verify how powerful his magic was.</p><br/><p>Originally, it should have been the other way around. \u201cThank you for drawing out part of the Sorcerer King\u2019s power. Now we know better than to act recklessly around him,\u201d they should have said while expressing their gratitude. After all, if things had gone poorly, that magic might have been unleashed in a city.</p><br/><p>However, the Knight Corps did not see things that way. It was because they felt that Jircniv was a splendid Emperor that they believed he had asked for the use of that magic, knowing full well what it did. Thus, many suspicious gazes now fell upon Jircniv.</p><br/><p>This was the first time Jircniv had been so disgusted by his own reputation.</p><br/><p>However, crying and complaining would not help things. If someone could do something in his place, Jircniv would gladly cry and scream and rest until his stomach pains went away. Of course, nobody could do Jircniv\u2019s job for him, so he had to handle it himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn that Sorcerer King! It\u2019s all his fault!\u201d</p><br/><p>He pressed against the pain that radiated from his stomach, no \u2015 Jircniv paused to think.</p><br/><p>This was not \u201cthe Sorcerer King\u2019s fault\u201d. This was \u201cthe Sorcerer King\u2019s conspiracy.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was very possible that the state of the Empire might have been orchestrated by him. When he calmed down and considered it, the possibility of that was very high.</p><br/><p>Jircniv took out a key and opened a drawer. He withdrew a bottle from within.</p><br/><p>Then, he pressed the silver ring he wore on his left hand against it.</p><br/><p>The Ring of Unicorn \u2015 an item which could detect poisons and which enhanced resistance to poison and disease, which could also heal wounds once a day. After confirming that there was no reaction, he gulped it down.</p><br/><p>Jircniv placed the bottle on his desk, and frowned.</p><br/><p>He took a mouthful of water from a bottle on the desk, to wash away the now-familiar astringent taste spreading through his mouth. After that, Jircniv pressed the area around his belly again.</p><br/><p>Was it just a placebo effect, or had his wound really been healed? While there was no way he could know for sure, at least his stomach pains had subsided for now.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaaah~\u201d</p><br/><p>After that abnormally heavy sigh, as though ponderous tasks awaited him, he continued his work. First, he had to start with that accumulated pile of documents.</p><br/><p>A quiet knocking rang through the room, as though it were waiting for his hand to reach out.</p><br/><p>The man who entered was a scribe. All of Jircniv\u2019s hand-picked scribes were excellent workers. However, this man was easily the equal of Roune.</p><br/><p>Incidentally, there were no women among the scribes. The only woman who Jircniv trusted to handle this sort of work was one of his concubines.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty\u2015\u201d</p><br/><p>Jircniv waved to cut short a greeting that might take a very long time.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2015No need for that, spare me the greetings. Don\u2019t waste time, get to the point.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Your Majesty. Those traders from that nation have finally replied to us. They seem to have very good stock with them, and they will be visiting the Imperial Capital soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jircniv smiled at this, the best news he had heard in the past few weeks.</p><br/><p>The nation in question was the Slaine Theocracy. Needless to say, the trader in question was an emissary from them.</p><br/><p>While this room was warded against spying, after witnessing that spell from the Sorcerer King, he had come to believe that all these countermeasures were little more than stage dressing. The fact was, he had come to feel that someone was spying on him of late.</p><br/><p>Still, no matter how many people he sent to investigate, they found no observers. The only conclusion they could reach was that this was a paranoid delusion on Jircniv\u2019s part. Granted, his nerves had been wound up quite tightly of late, so it might actually be the case. However, he could not get rid of the sense of foreboding that came from being watched.</p><br/><p>In the past, he might have let Fluder set up anti-spying measures, but he could not do that now. For all he knew, Fluder might already have betrayed him. Therefore, Jircniv had to operate under the assumption that spies had already infiltrated the Imperial Capital.</p><br/><p>Therefore, all policies concerning important matters needed their own codewords. Of course, there were a few small problems which cropped up at a result, but it was still better than letting the alliance against Ainz Ooal Gown be exposed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, when will it be?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI believe they intend to arrive within the next few days.\u201d</p><br/><p>Normally speaking, he would have openly invited them to the Imperial Capital, but that would be far too obvious.</p><br/><p><i>It\u2019s best to meet them while pretending that it was a coincidence. However, what sort of location would avoid suspicion?</i></p><br/><p>He was out of options, but even if that were the case, he could not give up like this was just a regular game. Casting that spell of utmost cruelty was essentially telling Jircniv, \u201cI am undead, so slaying the living is only natural.\u201d He could not possibly ignore a being like that.</p><br/><p>It was the duty of the Emperor of the Baharuth Empire to improve his chances of victory, even if it was only by a little.</p><br/><p>In order to achieve that aim, one of the measures he had taken was to forge a secret alliance with the Slaine Theocracy. The Theocracy was a country with a longer history than the Empire, and it also counted divine magic as one of the pillars of their nation. There was no doubt that it was the best nation one could appeal to for ways to deal with the undead.</p><br/><p>However, it would be very bad if the Sorcerous Kingdom learned of his contact with the Theocracy.</p><br/><p>The Empire was now an ally of the Sorcerous Kingdom, and one which had helped guarantee its sovereignty. The reason why the Empire had done this was to understand the strength and organization of the Sorcerous Kingdom, as well as everything else within it. If it was discovered that they were working against the Sorcerous Kingdom, the Empire would undoubtedly be the first target for the might of the Sorcerer King.</p><br/><p>\u201cPermission to speak, Your Majesty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jircniv raised his chin, indicating that the man should continue.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs the act of opening hostilities with the Sorcerous Kingdom not a most foolish course of action?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jircniv glared at the scribe. <i>You too, huh. </i>He chucked a scroll case into a specially designated trash bin as he thought that.</p><br/><p><i>Don\u2019t crush my flagging heart, please\u2026 However\u2026</i></p><br/><p>\u201cThen, what would you suggest we do instead?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, about that\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jircniv smiled as he watched the scribe gulp audibly.</p><br/><p>\u201cRelax. I will not censure you for anything you say. Come, speak your mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, then, I apologize beforehand for any offense I might cause.\u201d</p><br/><p>With a cough, the secretary shared his thoughts:</p><br/><p>\u201cI believe we should continue strengthening our bond of alliance, and if the Sorcerous Kingdom has any requests\u2026 we should give in to them.\u201d</p><br/><p>The scribe\u2019s face was still pale despite Jircniv\u2019s guarantee.</p><br/><p>Within his heart, that treasonous statement warred with the fear that his very life might be extinguished.</p><br/><p>Jircniv once again smiled bitterly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2015Hah?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was because he knew the man\u2019s caliber that he felt that his gaping mouth was quite comical. Jircniv smiled in a different way than before, and then continued speaking:</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel what you are saying is correct. In your position, I might well make the same proposal. No, it would be strange if any man I appointed as a scribe did not suggest such a thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Simply put, the Sorcerous Kingdom was far too powerful.</p><br/><p>Though they could only judge from a military standpoint, it was clear that the Sorcerous Kingdom was on a level that they could not even hope to deal with.</p><br/><p>The personal power of the Sorcerer King Ainz Ooal Gown alone was already far too risky to face. Then there was the army of the dead he had brought to the battlefield, each of which was rumored to be able to level a nation by themselves.</p><br/><p>They were in completely different dimensions. When one thought about it, the very idea was laughable.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough I feel that is the best choice, does that mean we should not prepare to take some other action? For instance, if the Sorcerer King intends to destroy the Kingdom, do you think bending the knee to him will suffice to spare us?\u201d</p><br/><p>He had not yet heard of any massacres in E-Rantel.</p><br/><p>Could it be that the undead were not there? After trying to gather some information, he discovered that the undead openly occupied the city, turning E-Rantel into a demon city.</p><br/><p>It might be that he intended to rule the residents of the area without slaughtering them, but that was jumping to conclusions. After all, there was the news of how he had subdued that adamantite-ranked adventurer (Momon), so just from that point alone, it was dangerous to think that the Sorcerer King\u2019s tender mercies would extend to the Empire.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is as you say. It would seem I was so cowed by the Sorcerer King\u2019s overwhelming power that I could not even make such a rational decision. My deepest apologies.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to apologize. After all, the thought came to mind in the past\u2026 back to the point, where have the traders of that country chosen to rest?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems they will be lodging in the largest of the second of four.\u201d</p><br/><p>The second of four referred to a shrine of the God of Fire. The word \u201clargest\u201d was not code, so it probably referred to the largest shrine in the Kingdom \u2015 the Central Temple.</p><br/><p>From this point on, Jircniv began nonchalantly chatting about random issues, with some lies sprinkled into the mix.</p><br/><p>Sometimes, he would casually speak of made-up things. Even if anyone heard, investigating the truth of those words would be a tedious process. For the time being, he might have to continue this brain-straining work. As he thought about this, he realised they had been talking for several minutes.</p><br/><p>Jircniv then decided to get to the main issue.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is your family? Are they still well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHah? Ah, yes. They\u2019re very well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so? That\u2019s great. Good health is the most important thing, after all. I won\u2019t lie; the truth is, my body\u2019s been doing quite poorly of late. Medicine only keeps it at bay for a while. Do you think I should bring a priest over?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems the temples are not too happy with Your Majesty\u2019s recent actions. Applying pressure might result in a backlash. Why not visit in person, Your Majesty?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a wonderful idea.\u201d</p><br/><p>The temples battled the undead. Thus, to the priests, the founding of a nearby country which was ruled by a powerful undead being was something about which they were very wary. Thus, they had sent many requests to meet with Jircniv.</p><br/><p>However, Jircniv had refused each time.</p><br/><p>Jircniv was now in a state where he would take any help he could get, but he had his reasons for not accepting. One of them was because he did not trust their ability to keep out spies. The other was because Jircniv feared that if he told them what he knew, they might do something unpredictable.</p><br/><p>If both sides reached an accord, and the priests then decided to declare war on the powerful Sorcerer King \u201cbecause he is undead,\u201d the consequences hardly needed to be stated. It would result in the Empire being caught up in their suicidal actions.</p><br/><p>In short, Jircniv was afraid that once he made contact with the temples, the Sorcerer King would assume that the Empire was hostile toward him.</p><br/><p>Jircniv sighed deeply.</p><br/><p>Although he had hoped they would wait for the right moment, it would seem they did not understand that point, However, the Theocracy\u2019s diplomatic party had covertly reached the Imperial Capital. Perhaps if he waited for them to make contact with the temples, there might be a chance to turn it all around.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, I should make some time in the next few days to visit the temples and let them take a look at my body.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat seems like a wise course of action. Then, I shall go make the arrangements now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you. Then, what shall we do about the arena? I remember there was an exhibition match scheduled soon; shall we let it go on as planned? I\u2019m not going to be stopped by words like \u2018you said you were going for a checkup, so you can\u2019t go there\u2019, you know. If any of you wants to watch the fight with me, you may join me in my VIP room.\u201d</p><br/><p>The scribe\u2019s eyes widened, and his eyes gleamed as he tried to divine the true meaning of that statement.</p><br/><p><i>Yes, that\u2019s right. You\u2019d be right to suspect me. Come, see what I really mean.</i></p><br/><p>Jircniv wanted to avoid meeting the people of the Theocracy in the temples.</p><br/><p>The temples contained knowledge on healing and various other kinds of wisdom. If they were chosen as targets for a pre-emptive strike, far too many things would be lost, at a time where this accumulated knowledge was more important than anything else.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood. Then let me handle the arena. I believe you were scheduled to visit the war wounded at the hospital on that day as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jircniv had not received this news, so this was probably a bluff.</p><br/><p>In other words, he was suggesting to Jircniv that the hospital might be a better location than the arena.</p><br/><p>Jircniv had chosen the arena because he had heard that it often hired priests to heal the wounded. With that in mind, he was thinking of bringing the emissaries from the Slaine Theocracy over in the guise of those priests.</p><br/><p>\u201cDelay the visitations. We\u2019ll follow the schedule we agreed on earlier.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, all talk about the traders had disappeared halfway through the conversation. If there were any eavesdroppers, what would they think of this? What could they learn from the phrase \u201csecond of four\u201d?</p><br/><p>However fiendish the Sorcerer King\u2019s intellect, he could not make any plans without any information to work with. In addition, not all of the Sorcerer King\u2019s subordinates could be as intelligent as he was. Also, the more spies there were, the higher the chances they would be exposed. Since no information on those spies had been found yet, there probably were not many spies. Or rather, he hoped that was the case.</p><br/><p>The spectre of the Sorcerer King\u2019s absolute and undeniable magic haunted his mind. Part of him constantly thought \u201cSince they\u2019re the Sorcerer King\u2019s men, they must be exceptional too.\u201d Indeed, he had seen many incredibly powerful beings arrayed before that throne, so that implied that those spies might be of the same caliber as them.</p><br/><p><i>If that\u2019s really the case, then we don\u2019t have a chance at all\u2026 if swearing vassalage to him will settle things, then wouldn\u2019t that be the best course of action?</i></p><br/><p>He had just drunk a healing potion, but Jircniv felt a spike of pain in his stomach again.</p><br/><p>\u2666 \u2666 \u2666</p><br/><p>Two weeks later, a coach with Jircniv on board left for the arena.</p><br/><p>On the surface, he seemed to be going to the Arena to watch a fight, but in truth, he was there to enter into an agreement with emissaries of the Slaine Theocracy and high-ranking priests of the Empire.</p><br/><p>He had not brought any of his imperial guardsmen with him to avoid standing out, but two of the Empire\u2019s Four Knights \u2015 \u201cLightning Bolt\u201d and \u201cViolent Gale\u201d \u2015 were on the vehicle as Jircniv\u2019s guards.</p><br/><p>If possible, he would have liked to use all of these outstanding warriors to protect him. However, \u201cHeavy Explosion\u201d was not reliable, so he had left her behind under the pretext of guarding the Imperial Capital. No, saying that she was unreliable was not exactly correct. To be precise, he could already tell from her actions that she wanted to move on to the Sorcerous Kingdom. Thus, in order to avoid leaking any information to her which she could offer to the Sorcerous Kingdom as a gift, Jircniv had decided to keep a distance from her.</p><br/><p>She had originally said, \u201cI will do anything to lift this curse, even point this sword at Your Majesty\u201d. Jircniv understood this, but had still decided to make use of her. Therefore, he could not rebuke her even if she decided to betray the Empire. However, he still could not allow her to take away information that was critical to the Empire.</p><br/><p>That said, if she really had managed to eavesdrop on the Empire\u2019s state secrets, then he would need to have her arrested. However, she was one of the strongest people in the Empire, so he would need to send out people on her level to eliminate her. In terms of swordsmanship, only \u201cLightning Bolt\u201d and \u201cViolent Gale\u201d were up to the task. Sending anyone else would only result in a one-sided slaughter for them. In addition, suppressing her with numbers meant that the Imperial Capital and the Emperor\u2019s security details would be thinned out.</p><br/><p>That being the case, he would have to turn to Fluder\u2019s disciples, workers, or perhaps assassins as represented by Ijaniya, all of whom possessed skills outside of melee combat. However, no matter which option he chose, he would have to be prepared to pay dearly for it.</p><br/><p>The disciples were paid on a yearly basis \u2015 although ever since Fluder\u2019s betrayal, he had confiscated Fluder\u2019s land and made them nobles \u2015 so there would not be too many additional expenses there. However, dispatching them would require them to stop their work, which would incur losses invisible to the naked eye. In addition, if they were actually killed instead, the damage done would be more than what the latter two would cost.</p><br/><p>Therefore the best option was to deny \u201cHeavy Explosion\u201d the chance to obtain valuable information and let her go empty-handed to the Sorcerous Kingdom. That might well be the most satisfactory solution for everyone concerned.</p><br/><p>Jircniv had hinted as much to \u201cHeavy Explosion\u201d.</p><br/><p>However, \u201cHeavy Explosion\u201d was still in the Imperial Capital. Her response was along the lines of \u201cI shall remain until I repay the kindness that Your Majesty has shown me\u201d.</p><br/><p>He wanted to take that at face value, but that was impossible.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeavy Explosion\u201d might be one of the Empire\u2019s Four Knights, but the Sorcerous Kingdom would most likely rate her fighting power very poorly. Each and every one of the many undead directly loyal to the Sorcerer King were stronger than her. Because of that, she was looking for a way to raise her value in their eyes.</p><br/><p>Jircniv\u2019s stomach began aching again as he thought about the hopeless reality that the Sorcerer King commanded a thousand undead who were individually stronger than \u201cHeavy Explosion\u201d, one of the mightiest warriors of the Kingdom \u2015 and that was not including the Sorcerer King himself.</p><br/><p><i>What should I do about this?!</i></p><br/><p>A single strong person cannot change the course of a battle, they said. Yet, reality said otherwise.</p><br/><p>The Kingdom\u2019s Gazef Stronoff was a man who could do just that. It was even more true of the Empire\u2019s head magician, Fluder Paradyne, a being who could shake an entire nation.</p><br/><p>Each of them was a figure comparable to an army, or a country.</p><br/><p>In other words, even without considering the frightening power of its undead king, the Sorcerous Kingdom already wielded the might of a thousand armies.</p><br/><p><i>There\u2019s nothing to be done, is there? If\u2026 well, you couldn\u2019t stop him even with a thousand armies, right? \u2026As I thought, giving up is better\u2026</i></p><br/><p>Of course, he could not actually say that in front of his subordinates, but the idea had appeared in Jircniv\u2019s mind several times already. In fact, it had been his first thought once he heard about the Battle of Katze Plains.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2015Then, Your Majesty. After we meet with Silver Canary, we\u2019ll move out. Will that be alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jircniv shifted his gaze to regard the man seated before him.</p><br/><p>Before him was one of the Four Knights, \u201cLightning Bolt\u201d Baziwood Peshmel.</p><br/><p>Jircniv nodded in silence.</p><br/><p>They had hired a team of adamantite-ranked adventurers as security for today. While they were ostensibly there as a security detail, their main objective was to seek out any spies from the Sorcerous Kingdom. Regretfully, he could not meet up with Ijaniya, which had been considered as one of the alternatives. This also made Jircniv realise that inducting them into the Empire would be very difficult.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, although adamantite-ranked adventurers possess the highest fighting strength of all humanity, they still cannot step beyond the bounds of human ability. Please do not lower your guard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jircniv was painfully aware of those words which \u201cViolent Gale\u201d Nimble Arc Dale Anoch was trying to tell him. In fact, having seen the serried ranks of monsters within that throne room, he understood those words better than Nimble, who had watched that grand massacre with his own eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. However, they might well be able to hold out. Consider the Kingdom\u2019s adamantite-ranked adventurer, Momon. He pointed his sword at the Sorcerer King and defended the people with his strength. Since the members of Silver Canary are adamantite-ranked adventurers as well, it\u2019ll be quite troubling if they can\u2019t do the same.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he said this, Jircniv smiled sadly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd if even they\u2026 if even they can\u2019t do it, what then?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jircniv\u2019s question brought pained expressions to the faces of both knights. That look was a better answer than anything they could have said. Unconsciously, Jircniv began mirroring their expressions.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, please do not make that face. We might not be strong, but we will still devote our hearts and souls to completing our task.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Your Majesty. Please, adopt that confident, swaggering attitude of yours again. This fragile state you\u2019re in now doesn\u2019t suit you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Their gentle words pierced Jircniv\u2019s heart, and he could not bring himself to say, \u201cdoesn\u2019t that apply to you as well?\u201d Yet, he decided to accept them without complaint. Those words might have had as much effect as scattering water on the desert, but it was true that they had soaked into the desert of his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201c..Forgive me. Thank you for your sincerity. Then\u2026 since only the two of you are here, would you mind listening to my foolishness for a while?\u201d</p><br/><p>The two knights nodded wordlessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think I should do? Why would a monster like that appear next to the Empire? Why? What sin did I commit against heaven and earth to warrant that? What should I do to slay that monster \u2015 or failing that, to seal it away? Now that the Empire\u2019s trump card has been stolen away by the enemy, is there really any way to turn the situation around?\u201d</p><br/><p>He had not planned to say that much.</p><br/><p>If Jircniv did not stand at their head, his people would not be able to follow him. One who placed himself above others needed to adopt an appropriately superior attitude. This was especially true for the Bloody Emperor, who had purged many nobles.</p><br/><p>The Emperor could not afford to show weakness. That was a lesson which his respected father had taught him.</p><br/><p>However, all humans had a limit to what they could take.</p><br/><p>The human side of Jircniv was one he would only show to his concubines. Now, that part of him was shouting.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true I asked him to cast us a spell. But that couldn\u2019t be helped! We can\u2019t plan any countermeasures if we have no idea of his abilities! Am I at fault for that? Must I take responsibility for everything that went wrong? Everyone seems to think so!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jircniv bit his lip and clutched at his hair.</p><br/><p>The truth was, this was merely the tip of the iceberg. If Jircniv had completely given himself over to the feelings in his heart, he would probably be crying and screaming and rolling around on the floor. He was simply trying to protect the image of the Emperor.</p><br/><p>Still, he had some sense of self-awareness about how he was letting himself go.</p><br/><p>It would seem this was becoming a habit, so Jircniv returned himself to normal.</p><br/><p>\u201cForgive me. It seems I got a little excited. I\u2019ve been under a lot of stress recently.\u201d</p><br/><p>He glanced down, and saw strands of hair on his fingers.</p><br/><p>Judging from the portraits, none of his ancestors had thin hair. Jircniv could not help but muse that he might be the first Emperor in the history of the Empire to go bald.</p><br/><p>He waved his hand to keep his subordinates from noticing. Sometimes pity hurt more than a rebuke, and the same applied to the matter of hair loss.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat said, it might not be very convincing after you\u2019ve seen that side of me. However, the two of you need not worry. I\u2019ll take care of it, somehow. I won\u2019t let him do what he wants to the Empire.\u201d</p><br/><p>That confident smile of his seemed to soften the faces of his subordinates.</p><br/><p>However, none of them was truly at ease.</p><br/><p>They too understood that Jircniv\u2019s words were just temporary relief.</p><br/><p>No matter how they thought, they could not come up with any way to deal with that monster.</p><br/><p>In truth, Jircniv felt it would be impossible unless there was a weapon which could permanently slay the undead, or unless another very powerful human being showed up.</p><br/><p><i>That\u2019s why we need to rely on the Slaine Theocracy. Their history is longer than ours, so they might be able to find a weapon that can slay the undead in one blow. No, just sharing information with them will allow us to keep fighting!\u201d</i></p><br/><p>All he could do now was pray that this was the case.</p><br/><p>The coach continued forward, and with it rode Jircniv\u2019s last hopes.</p><br/><p>\u2666 \u2666 \u2666</p><br/><p>The arena was circular in shape. There was a large entrance at one of its sides through which the coach entered. This entrance led to the VIP rooms, and very few people made use of this entrance. The other entrances were used for the entry and exit of the regular patrons or for the transportation of cargo. These were the three main types of entrances to the arena.</p><br/><p>The first to alight from the coach were, naturally, the two knights serving as bodyguards. After they had verified the safety of the location, Jircniv dismounted from the coach.</p><br/><p>Five men waited for them there.</p><br/><p>Their manner of dress looked entirely out of place for the VIP entrance.</p><br/><p>Jircniv could evaluate the worth of any particular work of art with a glance, but he could not divine such information from their gear and equipment. This was because what they were wearing was both artwork and wargear. Theirs was not the outfit of a noble\u2019s house guards, but the panoply of battle-hardened veterans.</p><br/><p>By the normal rules of etiquette, the inferior party should have introduced themselves first. However, some adventurers did not care about status or rank, and these were such adventurers.</p><br/><p>Still, he was the ruler of the Empire. Was it really appropriate for him to be lowering his head to adventurers?</p><br/><p>Amidst this awkwardness, the man standing in the center of the group of five spoke up:</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, Emperor Jircniv Rune Farlord El-Nix. I believe this is the first time we have met, and it is an honor. We are the adamantite-ranked adventurer team Silver Canary, who have accepted the request of providing security services. I am the team leader, Freivartz. Pleased to meet you.\u201d</p><br/><p>His dignified voice echoed through the surroundings.</p><br/><p>He had a lute on his back and a rapier at his waist. He wore a chain shirt which wreathed his body in bizarre lights.</p><br/><p>All his equipment did not just reflect the light, but emitted magical radiance from within. Every piece of his panoply looked like it was a first-rate magic item, especially that lute, which was also known as Star Symphony.</p><br/><p>As he observed the man\u2019s thoroughly confident attitude, Jircniv recalled himself from several months back, and could not help but feel some envy.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I have heard about the deeds of you gentlemen, the highest-level adventurer team in my country. That heroic saga of how you slew the Radiant Crawler truly got my blood boiling. Therefore, I know about all of you to some extent. However, since this is a rare opportunity, could I trouble you to personally introduce the heroes of my country to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, allow me, as the bard to\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2015C\u2019mon chief, lay off a bit, will ya? Hate ta say it, but when I hear ya go at it, I break out in bumps. Shiny shortsword or whatnot\u2026 anyway, can we just skip that part? Ayy, Yer Majesty. Sorry \u2018bout the way I talk, I was born this way. No worries, yeah?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man beside Freivartz stepped forward and gently inclined his head.</p><br/><p>He was a stocky and short man. Though he had a smile on his face, those disproportionately small eyes of his had no mirth in them.</p><br/><p>He was Keila No Seydeshtin, a man with thief classes known as the \u201cPlanner\u201d.</p><br/><p>(TL Note: \u201cPlanner\u201d here is used in the same way as \u201cAssassin\u201d)</p><br/><p>There was not much information about the \u201cPlanner\u201d, so there was much which remained unknown about him. He was probably closer to the underworld and more involved in ambushes and assassination than regular thieves.</p><br/><p>Jircniv indicated that he should not worry about it, and then Baziwood chuckled.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, it\u2019s fine. His Majesty\u2019s long used to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, and this would be\u2026 you must be \u201cLightning Bolt\u201d-san of the Empire\u2019s Four Knights. Could it be you were born there as well, friend?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm? Ahh, no, probably in a different place. I popped out in a dirty little alley. You must have crawled out of a deeper and darker place than me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeems that way. The air around you\u2019s different\u2026 sorry \u2018bout that. Guess I was too hasty.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, \u201cDark Cloud\u201d.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never called myself \u201cDark Cloud\u201d before\u2026 really, this is all your fault, chief.\u201d</p><br/><p>Freivartz simply quirked up the corners of his mouth as Kaila looked to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better to let us introduce ourselves rather than go by strange nicknames. My apologies, Your Majesty. First, this is Seyde, our eyes and ears. Next is our fighter. You might be a bit surprised when you see him, but I can guarantee his strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, of course His Majesty won\u2019t doubt him. After all, I feel he might be stronger than me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad to hear that from a strong man. This is Fan Rong.\u201d</p><br/><p>The person being introduced was a red-furred ape which stood around 170cm tall. He was wearing armor that looked like it was made of white furs, and he had battle axes on either side of his waist.</p><br/><p>He was an Ape Beastman, as well as one who channelled the spirit of the apes through the power of his warrior class, the Beast Lord. He had read about this in a report before, but actually seeing it with his own eyes was quite the shock.</p><br/><p>And indeed, by appearances alone, he looked stronger than even Baziwood, the mightiest of Jircniv\u2019s subordinates.</p><br/><p>Fan Rong raised his right hand and waved to Jircniv and the others.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, next is the one who heals our wounds.\u201d</p><br/><p>Freivartz hurriedly began the next introduction. This was because he was worried Jircniv would be displeased.</p><br/><p>This time, the man at Freivartz\u2019s left stepped forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cForgive me,\u201d he said as the strange staff he held made a ringing noise. That weapon was apparently called a \u201cshakujo\u201d.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis humble monk goes by the name Unkei and is a follower of the Buddha. Pleased to meet you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Though he was dressed strangely, he seemed quite a bit more civilized than the Beast Lord from just before.</p><br/><p>After he removed his bizarre, large hat \u2015 called a fukaamigasa \u2015 the head thus revealed had no hair upon it. If he had not known that the man had shaved it all off himself, Jircniv might have looked pityingly upon him. He was quite young, after all.</p><br/><p>(TL Note: the fukaamigasa is a straw hat associated with monks)</p><br/><p>He wore a strange battle robe called a kasa. He was a <i>soryo</i>, who were spiritual magic casters that lacked a bit in the healing department, but which showed exceptional power when battling the undead.</p><br/><p>(TL Note: kasa are cassocks associated with Buddhist monks)</p><br/><p>The Buddha he followed hailed from the far South, and had few followers. Some viewed him as one of the followers of the Four Gods. There was little known about him and there had been no interest in building a temple to such a god within the Imperial Capital. However, Jircniv did know that this man\u2019s existence was considered a nuisance of sorts.</p><br/><p>Basically, the temples set the price for the use of healing magic. However, when a lone, unaffiliated user of healing magic appeared, how would they deal with him? What would they do if that man was also an adventurer of the highest order \u2015 an adamantite-ranked adventurer?</p><br/><p>There was no particular link between the Empire\u2019s government and its religion. The fact that Jircniv had no ties to them could be considered good fortune.</p><br/><p>He did not want to be further embroiled in troublesome issues.</p><br/><p>However, when checking through the man\u2019s record, he found that he displayed exceptional performance against the undead, which immediately drew Jircniv\u2019s attention. If need be, he might need to apply the necessary pressure to the temples. Of course, that was only if his abilities were really that effective.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. Then, the last one must be Powapon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is as you say, Your Majesty.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man Freivartz had saved for last was stranger than the ones before him. He was arguably the most bizarrely-dressed of the five men, and he lowered his head to Jircniv.</p><br/><p>His bare upper body was tanned black with strange white patterns painted all over him. This was probably because he was a member of the odd class called the Totem Shamans.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Aren\u2019t you cold?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have already equipped a magic item which protects against shifts in the temperature, so there is no problem at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jircniv could not help but feel surprised at the reply, which was more normal than he had expected. He had received reports about his queer appearance, as well as the news that he was a regular person under all that. Still, the sheer dissonance filled him with surprise. At a closer look, he seemed quite handsome, and quite young as well.</p><br/><p>Why had he chosen this class? Part of him wanted to know, but at the same time he did not want to now.</p><br/><p>Jircniv regarded Silver Canary before him.</p><br/><p>This was a weird team made up of weird members. The only thing they had in common was that they carried a feather of the silver canary their team had once raised somewhere on their persons (in the case of the Totem Shaman, it was on his waist).</p><br/><p>Those feathers glittered with silver light, as though they had just been shed.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood, gentlemen. Then, I\u2019ll be in your care today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave it to us, Your Majesty. Think of it as coming aboard our ship.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jircniv could not help but grin wryly as he heard Freivartz\u2019s words, and made to leave. However \u2015</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2015Hang on a bit, Yer Majesty,\u201d Seyde said in a dull voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been hired to protect ya, Yer Majesty, so please don\u2019t walk so far ahead. That okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is not a matter of being okay or not. You were hired to protect me, so I will do whatever you deem necessary. In addition, if you feel that you need to make use of their strength, please feel free to order them around. However, I\u2019d like to request that they be kept near me as much as possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell how about that. So we can command the Empire\u2019s Four Knights as we please, I guess we\u2019ve really hit the big leagues now. Still, it\u2019ll be fine if you two stay by His Majesty\u2019s side. If anything happens, just run when we give you the instruction. That oughta do it. Then, play us a tune, chief.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it. My apologies for Seyde\u2019s tone, Your Majesty. No matter how many times I tell him, he always ends up doing that\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to worry. That said, it might be troublesome if he did that in a public area\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps Freivartz had gotten the message, but he nodded slightly. That implied that he knew the right time and place for this sort of thing.</p><br/><p>And then, he sang. No, this was less of a song than a collection of bizarre sounds. This was because there were some parts he could hear, but not understand. It stopped after several seconds, although the strange music lingered in their hearts. Then, Seyde made his move.</p><br/><p>If one had to attach some form of sound effect to his movements, both \u201csluggish\u201d and \u201cslimy\u201d would be appropriate. Either way, Jircniv was not capable of those movements.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, please keep about ten meters back and follow me.\u201d</p><br/><p>They did as Seyde said, keeping ten meters back before moving on. Jircniv took the opportunity to ask Freivartz about the song from just now.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat was that, anyway?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes Your Majesty not know? That was a bard skill, a spellsong. It differs from user to user, and can be performed with various instruments, but in my case, I evoke its effects through song.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s it, huh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Freivartz could not help but smile as he saw Jircniv mumble to himself. Just at that moment, Jircniv remembered something he wanted to learn about, but did not have a chance to follow up on. He decided to take this opportunity and asked:</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I have something to ask you. Can that spellsong control people?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpellsongs can convey a suggestion effect, just as spells can. It should be possible. In addition, they should be able to charm people, to a certain extent.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jircniv looked at Freivartz.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see\u2026 is that so\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat should be it, yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>So that monster had the power of a bard, unless\u2015</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, what do you know of monsters which look like frogs?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2015Unless it was an innate ability as a monster. That possibility could not be completely crossed out. It was very important to make sure of that.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrogs? You mean like Giant Toads?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, not like that. Something more intelligent. I\u2019m talking about a monster which stands on two legs, and can instantly activate something like that spellsong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Do you mean a Toadman? A Toadman bard would fit your description\u2026 but if I recall correctly, Toadmen are not particularly outstanding demihumans. Perhaps if it was an old, tribe leader-class Toadman\u2026 I\u2019ve heard those can use special abilities to confuse the foe.\u201d</p><br/><p>What happened there was not quite confusion.</p><br/><p>He had read about the demihumans known as Toadmen, but their appearances differed slightly from the monster called Demiurge. Could he be a mutant or offshoot Toadman, or perhaps a king-type Toadman? Those possibilities could not be discarded, but it was most likely that those were not the case.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems not. My deepest apologies, Your Majesty. There is simply too little information. Perhaps, if you could tell me more about the creature in question, I might be able to solve this mystery for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was like a life preserver to a drowning man.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally now. Then, I shall tell you about the appearance of this monster. If possible, could you use your wisdom to help me out? In addition, could you tell me in detail about spellsongs?\u201d</p><br/><p>In the Empire, there was probably nobody who knew more about monsters than adamantite-ranked adventurers.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, that would be imposing on them. These are their livelihoods you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><br/><p>Freivartz chuckled in response to Baziwood\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell well, it\u2019s true we can\u2019t talk too much about our trump cards. Still, answering that question earlier should be fine. Just\u2026 would it not be better to ask that great magic caster-dono? I\u2019m sure he would know more than us\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jircniv strove not to show any information when the topic of Fluder came up.</p><br/><p>He had already issued a gag order on Fluder\u2019s betrayal, so no information had been leaked. For now, Fluder was still in his position as the head magician, though his privileges and powers were slowly being stripped away so he would not notice. At the same time, he was looking for a way to fill the gap Fluder would leave.</p><br/><p>From the size of that gap, Jircniv realised exactly how much of a boon Fluder had been for the Empire, but it was already too late.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t keep relying on the old man. This is like homework for a student. If one simply waits for all the answers because one had a good teacher, he\u2019ll wind up being scolded for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jircniv\u2019s words were met with several laughs.</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed, Your Majesty has a point. I understand. Well, the fees for this request were quite above average, given the task we were hired to perform. Then, I\u2019ll summarize the matter of spellsongs for you later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. I\u2019ll leave that to you, then.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were several VIP rooms in the arena. One was reserved for the arena\u2019s investors. One was reserved for high-ranking nobles. Then, there was the one reserved for the Emperor, for a total of three. They were currently heading for the room that had been set aside for the Emperors through the generations. Perhaps Seyde had scouted the route before, but he did not ask the way even though he was leading the group.</p><br/><p>At last they arrived, but at the corner before they could see the door of the room, Seyde reached a hand out to Jircniv, indicating that he should stop.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot picking up anyone here, but let me go first. Can you guys wait at this corner for a bit?\u201d</p><br/><p>He did not wait for a response to his whispered words, but instead turned the corner like he was going for a stroll. His curiosity piqued by this, Jircniv had a look of curiosity on his face as he tried to spy out the situation.</p><br/><p>He approached the door without making a sound, and after doing something, he slowly opened the door. Although he had barely cracked it open, that seemed to be enough for him to enter, and his entire body vanished into the room.</p><br/><p>After a while, the door opened, and they could see Seyde\u2019s face within.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. This room is safe.\u201d</p><br/><p>The group entered the room, which had been verified as safe.</p><br/><p>Jircniv looked around.</p><br/><p>It was a little small, but the exquisitely-made furniture was all first-class. The room had been immaculately cleaned for the Emperor, who hardly visited.</p><br/><p>A large window had been opened on the side of the room which overlooked the arena, allowing a panoramic view of the scenes below. If one squinted, they would be able to see rows upon rows of fully occupied seats, packed with an audience which was excited to a fever pitch and cheering wildly.</p><br/><p>The reason for the large crowd was because the Martial Lord had been suddenly scheduled for an appearance.</p><br/><p>The king of the ring \u2015 the Martial Lord \u2015 was overwhelmingly powerful. There was nobody he could fight in earnest. Therefore, it had been a long time since there had been a match with the Martial Lord.</p><br/><p>It was because of such a long-awaited battle with the Martial Lord that the crowd had come, drawn by anticipation of the heroic figure who would battle him.</p><br/><p>As expected, a big reason for that was admiration for strength. Since the Empire had its professional warriors called knights, the battlefield was like another world for the dwellers of the Imperial City. This was why they looked forward to the spectacle of a life-and-death battle.</p><br/><p>No, he had heard there were knights who enjoyed the arena as well.</p><br/><p>In other words, they looked forward to a spectacle and display of brutality.</p><br/><p>Just as Jircniv was spaced out while thinking of this, Silver Canary completed their sweep of the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cWere there any signs of divination magic being used in here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe discovered no traces of such magic, Your Majesty. Is that right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYup. Well, seeing if spells have been cast is pretty hard for me, so I did a look-see around, checked for any magic items, but nothing turned up. Still, hope ya don\u2019t forget that I don\u2019t have the perception of a thief. Please don\u2019t think it\u2019s absolutely safe\u2026 well, our chief\u2019s boosted our detection ability with his spellsong, so it should be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRegarding the field of magic, this humble monk has used a divination to investigate the surroundings. However, there were no traces of any spells being cast. In any event, I have created a magical barrier which should impede divination spells, so one can assume that it should be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Unkei thumped his shakujo on the ground, and a clear ringing echoed through the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, may I make another request? Is there magic which detects the presence of people nearby? It would be best if it was a spell which could detect even an invisible person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRegretfully, this humble monk does not count such spells among his repertoire. However, I believe our leader has such a spell.\u201d</p><br/><p>Freivartz, whose name had come up, signalled that he understood and left the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow what? What measures will you take if the foe intends to eavesdrop upon us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jircniv strove to think of what he could do against Ainz Ooal Gown. However, it was impossible to imagine what surpassed the imagination. The fact was, that man seemed so massive in his mind that everything he could visualize felt insignificant against him.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Frankly speaking, I think it should be fine after doing this much. At least, that\u2019s what I think. Don\u2019t look at me like that, we\u2019ve fortified ourselves with several spells already, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how it is, Your Majesty. This humble monk has already used anti-divination magic and configured it so that any attempt at magical investigation will send an alert to me. Please be at ease.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seyde and Unkei spoke thusly, one after the other.</p><br/><p>Did they think he was obsessed? Or did they think he had gone a little mad because he was worried about assassination?</p><br/><p>Still, what would these two think if he told them they were going up against the Sorcerer King? Now that was what really interested Jircniv. Would they say, \u201cwe can\u2019t possibly prepare enough against him?\u201d Or would they say, \u201cIf we\u2019d known that, we wouldn\u2019t have come for this measly sum\u201d?</p><br/><p>Naturally, the best scenario was to not tell them anything about the Sorcerer King and have them prepare against all threats as best as they could.</p><br/><p>Still, no matter how much he tried to censor information on the Sorcerer King, he could not stopper 60,000 mouths.</p><br/><p>News had probably gotten out. That being the case, since adventurers tended to spend more time gathering information the higher-ranked they were, there was a very large chance they had already learned about the Sorcerer King\u2019s abilities.</p><br/><p><i>It wouldn\u2019t be hard for them to figure out why I really wanted them here, no?</i></p><br/><p>After pondering various possibilities, Jircniv decided to bluff his way through with a warm smile.</p><br/><p>The two of them realised that Jircniv could not accept what they had said. Neither did they have anything else to say beyond that.</p><br/><p>A great cheer rose up from the arena.</p><br/><p>From where they were, it would seem that one of the battles between the gladiators had a winner.</p><br/><p>In the past, the defeated were condemned to death, but not any more. There were still cases of deaths in battles, but there would be no killings after the victor was determined.</p><br/><p>Apparently, a gladiator had been spared because his repeated defeats were amusing. This allowed him to awaken his true power and he became champion, whereupon that particular restriction had been abolished. This decision had been made because there might be another person like him someday.</p><br/><p><i>Which Martial Lord was that? Although he couldn\u2019t compare to the current Martial Lord, he was apparently quite a powerful chap. But, these people aren\u2019t loyal to any country. I need to think about how to get them on my side\u2026</i></p><br/><p>\u201cIn any event, we\u2019re done here, Your Majesty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jircniv turned when he heard Freivartz\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>He should probably have been more sincere in his thanks toward these adamantite-ranked adventurers. However, he had simply tossed off the usual appreciation instead.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Still, we were hired for protection, so should we stand by in this room?\u201d</p><br/><p>They were hired as bodyguards. With that in mind, it was a reasonable suggestion.</p><br/><p>However, would it really be alright to have secret talks with them in the room?</p><br/><p>Granted, there might be merits to involving them in this. However, once they realised what he was aiming for, he ran the risk of making unnecessary enemies.</p><br/><p><i>Still, they\u2019re nothing compared to that \u2015 what am I thinking? I\u2019m comparing every challenge I meet to that monster, that\u2019s proof that I\u2019m starting to go mad, if nothing else. Besides, it would be stupid to keep making enemies.</i></p><br/><p>Jircniv shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but there will be important talks taking place after this. It would be quite troublesome to have you waiting in here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, it\u2019ll be very difficult to protect you that way, Your Majesty.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are two men I trust in this room. They ought to be able to buy enough time for you to get here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s true,\u201d the hereto silent Ape suddenly said. \u201cHowever, if the enemy is an assassin on the level of Seyde and if things go wrong, they might end up making quite a mess.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen you talk about an assassin of my level, you\u2019re probably talking about that girl from Ijaniya. She\u2019s the kind who can use ninjutsu to suddenly attack from the shadows.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, with these two warriors around, a sword-wielding foe should not pose any difficulty. However, what about magic? It is precisely that point which makes this humble monk uneasy. In addition, I feel that we will be more interested by the match than any talks Your Majesty is conducting, no?\u201d</p><br/><p>They had all ended up trying to persuade him to let him stay, but since Jircniv was this determined to not let information leak out, he could not accept their suggestions.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour doubts are well-reasoned, gentlemen. However, I cannot compromise on this point, be it as a man or as the Emperor of the Empire.\u201d</p><br/><p>Silver Canary looked to their leader, who sighed deeply.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped, then. I\u2019m sure Your Majesty must have your reasons which you can\u2019t disclose to us. Then, we\u2019ll stand watch outside. However, can you tell us exactly who is coming?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA reasonable question. However, you have to pretend that you saw nothing. Can you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. We will not reveal anything, no matter who comes. If it gets out, we will gladly bear the consequences.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI trust you. First are the High Priests of the God of Fire and the God of Wind. There will be four other priests with them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. Then, we\u2019ll be on guard for anyone besides these people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, please do. This VIP room was segregated from the other VIP rooms during its construction. I doubt anyone will get lost and wander here by accident.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood\u2026 Also, is it alright if we break the lock on the doors, Your Majesty?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou may destroy them if you see fit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fan stepped forward. A sinewy, scratchy sound came from his hands, which clutched the hilts of his battleaxes with a force that no human could match. It seemed a bit excessive just to break a lock, but Jircniv was no warrior, and had no room to comment.</p><br/><p>However, the two members of the Four Knights had surprised looks on their faces as they spoke quietly to each other. That got Jircniv\u2019s attention.</p><br/><p>Fan slowly raised his battleaxes.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2015Ah, you can\u2019t break the doors.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fan stopped halfway as he heard Freivartz speak. Jircniv\u2019s brows furrowed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy not? Weren\u2019t we going with the plan of \u2018Oh, we were planning to break the lock, but we wrecked the door too, what a shame, why don\u2019t we come in as well?\u2019 or something?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that this time. I don\u2019t want to get involved in that complex political stuff.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed. This humble monk does not wish to be even more hated by the temples.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll right. Then this much should be enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fan gently swung his battle axe, and effortlessly broke the lock.</p><br/><p>He should have been speechless. Or perhaps he should have been displeased. Perhaps he should have felt many things, but all Jircniv felt was impressed. It made him think, <i>as expected of an adamantite-ranked adventurer</i>.</p><br/><p>He was not impressed with how he could so easily break a lock with a battleaxe, but by the sheer audacity of openly saying such things in front of the highest authority in this country. In addition, there was the arrogance it took to declare that they were willing to ignore the wishes of their client \u2015 who was also the most powerful man in the country \u2015 in order to do the best job they could.</p><br/><p>These were the things that Jircniv now lacked.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I might as well drag them all into the mud of bureaucracy so they can\u2019t escape.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Jircniv quietly mumbled that, the members of Silver Canaries fled like frightened rabbits, as though they had arranged it from the beginning.</p><br/><p>The only people left with Jircniv were the two knights, who looked at each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was impressive. They worked together so closely without any form of communication. \u2026Perhaps that\u2019s only to be expected? They\u2019re adamantite-ranked because they can do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Well, I don\u2019t know what to say. Though, it might not be quite right to admire them\u2026 Your Majesty, should we make drinks?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe should. Sorry about that. Can you help me with the preparations?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood. Then, come help out too, Baziwood-dono.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baziwood frowned at the suggestion.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Me too? Your Majesty, we should have brought a maid along, shouldn\u2019t we? Our guests would probably find the drinks tastier if a girl was serving them. I mean, I know I would.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes. Enough complaining. Baziwood-dono, please be extra careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease, Baziwood. There\u2019s no point wishing for what we can\u2019t get. We have to work with what we have. Just like the Empire.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat analogy could use some work, Your Majesty,\u201d Baziwood spoke as he busied himself with the preparations.</p><br/><p>Cries of encouragement rang out from the arena below, and there were howls which sounded slightly different from those of wild beasts.</p><br/><p>The next match had already started.</p><br/><p>Jircniv searched his memories.</p><br/><p>The match before the Martial Lord\u2019s was apparently between adventurers and monsters. Matches where adventurers fought were quite popular with the audience, because it was more likely that they would be flashy affairs laced with magical explosions and the like.</p><br/><p>Jircniv felt very touched as he looked down on the heated intensity below him, and he said</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a peaceful sight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally, Your Majesty?\u201d</p><br/><p>As he wondered why someone was responding to his self-directed mutterings, Jircniv turned to see Baziwood standing before him. Nimble had a look of annoyance on his face as he handled Baziwood\u2019s share of the work as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t seem peaceful to me at all. Just look.\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the adventurers was struck by the claw of a bestial monster, and blood flew through the air. The audience wailed and shouted their encouragement.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean the fight, I meant the audience.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jircniv looked over the loudly-shouting crowd.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this not a peaceful sight, compared to the situation which the Empire is in? If the people knew the sort of monsters which lurked under that thin, fragile layer of skin, do you think they could enjoy themselves like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut isn\u2019t peace good? There\u2019s no point letting the people go around with aching bellies, is there?\u201d</p><br/><p>Baziwood was right.</p><br/><p>Jircniv deeply regretted the pointless words he had spoken.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, Baziwood. Then, it\u2019s almost time. What about the preparations?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Your Majesty. I was a bit worried we would not make it in time because <i>somebody</i> was not helping out, but the drinks and paper are all laid out. So is the ink.\u201d</p><br/><p>The astounding quantity of ink and paper was in case someone was eavesdropping on the VIP room. Although he felt that the cheering was loud enough and this room was distant enough from the others for that not to be a problem, and listening alone could only get one so much, it did not hurt to be redundantly prepared.</p><br/><p>He knew it was very troublesome. He had done this before in the Imperial City, but this was really very tiring.</p><br/><p>The reason he had gone to such cumbersome lengths was because the might of the Sorcerous Kingdom was an unknown value.</p><br/><p>If he knew what they could and could not do, his response might have changed.</p><br/><p>He had planned to use the war to mount an investigation, but it had ended in a truly horrific manner, leading to a terrible tragedy. Still, he could not completely give up on his investigations. He thought of other methods, but if they were no safer than before, then he could only tremble before the enemy\u2019s shadow. But even if he did get any results, even if he did uncover any actionable methods, he might end up being paralyzed by that same shadow to the point where he might as well give up.</p><br/><p>No, he could not forget that heat that passed through his throat.</p><br/><p>\u201cAinz Ooal Gown \u2015 if I knew the limits of the Sorcerer King\u2019s power, I might not have needed to go this far.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that point, he had asked him to help as a collaborator, but now that he was a king and a peer, asking him for such help was nearly impossible. No, he could still ask, but thinking about the potential price of such aid made his head ache.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just the Sorcerer King, Your Majesty. It\u2019s pretty bad as long as we don\u2019t know what his vassals can do, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What if those subordinates are stronger than the Sorcerer King himself?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could that be? That\u2019s impossible, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jircniv broke into a cold sweat at that answer.</p><br/><p>As he reflected on the fact that the Four Knights were stronger than him \u2015 and that they were his subordinates \u2015 he could not bring himself to say that it was impossible. One who stood above others did not need pure physical strength, but other things.</p><br/><p>What if Ainz Ooal Gown was like that?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2015No, it can\u2019t be. Listen, Nimble. You\u2019ve got it wrong. Understood?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! Sorry, Your Majesty.\u201d</p><br/><p>If that was really the case, then they were finished. He hoped that at the very most, those subordinates would be equal to the Sorcerer King \u2015 and Jircniv was desperately praying to the gods that they would be weaker than him.</p><br/><p>As he thought, they did not have enough information.</p><br/><p><i>I guess we should continue that plan of trying to learn something from that Dark Elf girl, with the knowledge that it could be dangerous. Granted, we can\u2019t buy a lot of slaves from the Theocracy, but maybe that method could\u2026 Or perhaps trying the boy (Aura) would be better? No, he looks too young, so using women on him probably won\u2019t work. Besides, he seems quite strong-willed.</i></p><br/><p>Just as Jircniv settled in for a long contemplation, a knocking came from the door.</p><br/><p>The three men looked at each other, and then Nimble went to open the door.</p><br/><p>As expected, Freivartz was there.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, the guests have arrived. There are six people in total and I\u2019ve met the High Priests before, so I believe it\u2019s them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, please come in\u2015\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as he said that, Seyde chipped in.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhoa, whoa hang on a tick, you guys in the back. Numbers add up, but something\u2019s off? The two of you in the back feel like me. So, you\u2019re from the punishment squad of the temples \u2015 the ones who kill apostate priests? I thought you guys were just supposed to be boogeymen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis humble monk is quite surprised too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhose people are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood grief, how troublesome. It would have been fine if you had just let us pass without incident\u2026 Firstly, you are mistaken. I \u2015 no, we have a good reason to be here. Namely, because the Emperor invited us. He\u2019ll be unhappy if you show hostility to us, you know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cH\u2015m. Okay, so could you wait there for a bit? Let me check if you guys are telling the truth here.\u201d</p><br/><p>He let Jircniv see their faces. There was the High Priest of the Fire God, the High Priest of the Wind God, as well as four others he had not seen before. They wore dark-colored hoods which prevented him from seeing their full faces, and that was the most suspicious part.</p><br/><p>Since this was the first time they had met, there was no guarantee that they actually were emissaries of the Theocracy. However, since the High Priests were there as well, things would not be able to progress if he did not believe them. The Sorcerer King would be the only one who benefited from any internal disputes which resulted.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are the guests I was waiting for. Sorry, but could you let them in?\u201d</p><br/><p>The members of Silver Canary had shocked looks on their faces, but they still let them pass.</p><br/><p>Even after the doors were closed, they did not lower their hoods.</p><br/><p>Jircniv did not say anything about their impolite behavior. They were probably just as wary as Jircniv was, and the object of their mutual caution was the Sorcerer King.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems my guards have inconvenienced you. I apologize.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease, pay it no heed. The truth is, those adamantite-ranked adventurers were right about the two people in the back.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two emissaries took a seat, while the other two people stood at attention behind them.</p><br/><p>Jircniv wrote the word \u201cScripture\u201d on the sheet of paper he had. His response was a faint smile, but it spoke more than any words could. The Theocracy\u2019s special forces were known as the Scriptures, so they must have come from one of the Six Scriptures.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, why don\u2019t we enjoy the fight first? The main event is about to begin, is it not?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jircniv nodded to that question.</p><br/><p>The main event was when the excitement of the crowd reached its peak, and so the noise intensified. This would make eavesdropping very difficult, which was why he had chosen this time and this place.</p><br/><p>The emissary produced a document and handed it to Jircniv.</p><br/><p>Jircniv carefully revealed the document, so as not to let it be seen from the back or the sides, and saw several questions there.</p><br/><p>Simply put, they were asking why he had asked the Sorcerer King to use that spell.</p><br/><p>Then, they asked about the Emperor\u2019s position on the matter.</p><br/><p>About how much they knew about the Sorcerous Kingdom.</p><br/><p>It was couched in the most diplomatic of terms, but it was still a questionnaire.</p><br/><p>While they could have simply mailed it to him, the reason why he had managed to get them all the way here was because they feared the reach of the Sorcerous Kingdom\u2019s arms. Or perhaps it was because they did not trust the Empire.</p><br/><p>Dissatisfaction welled up in Jircniv\u2019s chest. However, when he recalled their relationship with the Sorcerous Kingdom, it was only natural that they would not trust them at all.</p><br/><p>Jircniv filled in his answers just as a round of cheering went up. It would seem the match was about to begin.</p><br/><p><i>\u201cBefore this grand bout, let me call your attention to Emperor El-Nix, who has come to spectate the battle! </i>Ladies and gentlemen<i>, please look to the VIP room above you!\u201d</i></p><br/><p>It was the announcer\u2019s voice, amplified by a magic item.</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jircniv rose, so the audience below him could see his face.</p><br/><p>The people cheered as one for Jircniv. He turned his handsome face to the people, and smiled silently to them. The women began shrieking for him, and Jircniv felt quite satisfied that his popularity had not yet waned.</p><br/><p><i>\u201cThank you very much! Then, next up, ladies and gentlemen, the long-awaited battle with the Martial Lord! The preparations will take a while, so please be patient.\u201d</i></p><br/><p>\u201cThe Martial Lord, huh,\u201d Jircniv muttered.</p><br/><p>Jircniv had once asked Baziwood about letting all the Four Knights battle the Martial Lord. He had laughed and said they had no chance of winning. The answer worried him, so he let Fluder gather some information about the Martial Lord. The results showed that the Martial Lord was a being that was so powerful that it was unfair.</p><br/><p>\u201cStill, who is the Martial Lord fighting, Your Majesty?\u201d</p><br/><p>The question from the emissary was an obvious one. The fact was, Jircniv did not have an answer for him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not too sure myself. This match with the Martial Lord seems to have been hastily decided and did not appear on the program either, for secrecy\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see,\u201d the emissary replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, anyone who could go one on one with the Martial Lord must be an adamantite-ranked adventurer. However, Silver Canary is here, so it must be someone from Eight Ripples. Honestly, I really can\u2019t approve of exhibition matches with a chance of killing one of the rare adamantite-ranked adventurers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI cannot completely refute that, but the fact is that strength is attractive. This place is probably best suited for letting the people see an example of overwhelming power and giving them a dream of making it their own.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man who interrupted was the High Priest of the God of Fire \u2015 in other words, the highest-ranking member of the God of Fire\u2019s faith.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat said, after considering the Empire\u2019s present condition, it\u2019s possible that it might end up lowering its military strength. The Martial Lord is the Empire\u2019s mightiest being. Why not enlist him into your forces?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026To think someone like you would actually say something like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Slaine Theocracy was a human-centric country. No, it would be better to say that they looked down on the countries of other races.</p><br/><p>They were a nation that could still exist in a world filled with various races after advertising that fact. One had to hand it to them. Or rather, one could say that uniting a species was a condition of building a strong nation.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just my personal opinion. It doesn\u2019t reflect on my country. Well, that\u2019s enough chit-chat for now, Your Majesty. Can I have your reply?</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed. Then\u2015\u201d</p><br/><p><i>\u201c\u2015The wait is over, ladies and gentlemen! Introducing our challenger!\u201d</i></p><br/><p>Jircniv\u2019s hand stopped as he was about to write the answer to the first question. This was because he was curious about the challenger, who was brave enough to issue a challenge to that Martial Lord. Being acknowledged as a challenger meant that he must be able to put up quite a fight. Did anyone like that still exist in the Empire?</p><br/><p>If he was outstanding enough and was willing to serve the Empire, he would employ him even if he lost. Depending on how things went, he might end up giving him the seat on the Four Knights that \u201cThe Immovable\u201d had left empty after his death.</p><br/><p><i>\u201c..The name of the challenger may well be known to many in the audience. That great man has come to grace us today! I give you, the Sorcerer King of the Sorcerous Kingdom, His Majesty! Ainz! Ooal! Gown!\u201d</i></p><br/><p>\u201c\u2015Haaaah?\u201d</p><br/><p>That sound of utter stupefaction escaped from Jircniv.</p><br/><p>He did not understand the announcer\u2019s words as they buried themselves into his brain.</p><br/><p>Confusion filled the arena, and the VIP room was deathly silent.</p><br/><p>Jircniv looked around him, and he was sure that everyone had heard the same thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cAinz Ooal Gown?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>\u2015Impossible.</i></p><br/><p>Of course it was impossible. The leader of a country could not possibly appear in a gladiatorial match in another country. This was obvious to anyone with common sense. It was not as if he was a barbarian.</p><br/><p>In the first place, they had been keeping an eye on the Sorcerous Kingdom\u2019s movements. If the Sorcerer King had entered the Empire, that matter would have reached Jircniv\u2019s ears immediately. It would have been an absolute top priority matter. He had arranged to have that news reach him whether he was in his harem or in some other place.</p><br/><p>If that news had not reached him despite all these efforts, that meant\u2015</p><br/><p><i>He secretly entered the country? Why would anyone do that? And he came to the arena? What on earth is he think\u2015 what? Could it be? Is that how it is? This\u2026 how is this possible?</i></p><br/><p>Jircniv\u2019s body shuddered uncontrollably.</p><br/><p>Then, he shifted his line of sight to look at the emissaries from the Slaine Theocracy.</p><br/><p>There were keen looks in those eyes under their hoods, and the looks in those eyes said only one thing. No, in all likelihood, Jircniv would have reached the same conclusion if he was in their shoes.</p><br/><p>They were thinking: <i>Jircniv called the Sorcerer King here.</i></p><br/><p>\u201cPlease wait. This is a trap!\u201d</p><br/><p>Indeed.</p><br/><p>All this was a conspiracy of Ainz Ooal Gown. If they did not understand that \u2015 no, if they could not accept that, the situation would become very dire.</p><br/><p>\u201cA trap laid by the Sorcerous Kingdom? Or by someone else? After all, this is the place you specified, Your Majesty, and we only learned about it a few hours ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was correct. He had been keeping everything hidden until the last moment in order to reduce the risk of information leaking out.</p><br/><p>Jircniv desperately tried to recall who knew about this matter. The number was very small, and all of them were reliable people. Or was that really the case?</p><br/><p>No\u2015</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2015It\u2019s possible that the information was extracted through magical domination. This is definitely not a part of my plan. This is the proof. If I had set this trap, would I be so panicked right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou expect us to believe that? Were you doing this to draw us in? Or perhaps, to sell us out?!\u201d</p><br/><p>They did not trust him at all.</p><br/><p>No, that was to be expected. Jircniv would be castigating them if he were in their place.</p><br/><p><i>Still, where was the leak? No, did it really leak? Could it be all this was all within the palm of his hand? He set out the bait, and waited for me to take the hook\u2015</i></p><br/><p>Suddenly , a chill wind blew across his back.</p><br/><p>How many of his actions had the Sorcerer King predicted?</p><br/><p>It was very possible that everything that had happened until now was part of his plan.</p><br/><p><i>The Sorcerer King is such an opponent, </i>Jircniv\u2019s brilliant mind concluded.</p><br/><p><i>How elaborate was his scheme, anyway? No, now\u2019s not the time to be afraid of his cunning! If I don\u2019t act quickly\u2015!</i></p><br/><p>\u201cNo good, we have to leave now\u2015\u201d</p><br/><p>However, it was too late.</p><br/><p>The intruder\u2019s voice was like that of a hunter who had seen his prey fall into a carefully-laid trap.</p><br/><p>\u201cJircniv Rune Farlord El-Nix-dono. It has been a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he struggled to control his panicked breathing, he saw the form of the Sorcerer King, who had ascended from the heart of the arena to the same height as that of the VIP room.</p><br/><p>That hateful face of his was on full display. It must have been to let everyone know that it was the man himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cThuh, the\u2015 huu. The same to you, Gown-dono. I did not think I would meet you in a place like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had no idea what to say. Just about anything he said could be held against him. However, Jircniv\u2019s lips did not open, as if they had been glued shut.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe feeling is mutual. What a coincidence!\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Kuku,</i> the Sorcerer King laughed evilly. He obviously did not feel it was a coincidence.</p><br/><p>It was not a coincidence at all.</p><br/><p>Jircniv was certain that all this was part of Ainz Ooal Gown\u2019s scheme.</p><br/><p>By taking control of the secret talks with the Theocracy, he would simultaneously apply pressure on both Jircniv and the Theocracy and prevent them from allying with each other.</p><br/><p>That was a truly twisted genius.</p><br/><p>He wiped his sweaty palms on his clothes.</p><br/><p>A lot of information must have leaked out. The question was, how much of it did he know?</p><br/><p>Just as Jircniv was struggling to think, the hateful lights in the Sorcerer King\u2019s eye sockets turned to regard the Theocracy\u2019s emissaries.</p><br/><p>\u201cFriends of yours, Your Majesty?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jircniv had no way of answering Ainz\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>This was no simple question.</p><br/><p>It was a test of his intentions.</p><br/><p>Would he lie to protect the people of the Theocracy, or sell them out, as a friend of the Sorcerous Kingdom?</p><br/><p>It was such a malicious scheme that Jircniv began feeling nauseous.</p><br/><p>That emotionless skull looked like it was twisted by evil. It must be mocking him, Jircniv, who could not speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? El-Nix \u2015 no, Jircniv-dono. You look pale. Are you unwell?\u201d</p><br/><p>The fact that he sounded genuinely concerned first disgusted, and then terrified him. He felt like a small animal, squirming within a loving hand. As a human being, it was only natural to feel that terror wrapped up in that joy.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt, it\u2019s fine, it\u2019s nothing. I seem to have gotten a little dizzy from standing up so suddenly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so. Well, they say your body is your best asset, you\u2019d best take care of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jircniv\u2019s excuse sounded very unnatural, but at least he was off the hook for now. Was he waiting for the right moment to finish off his prey, or was he indulging his beloved hobby of sadism? Or perhaps\u2015</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, would you gentlemen like to introduce yourselves? I am the Sorcerer King, Ainz Ooal Gown.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2015Perhaps that was what he was aiming for.</p><br/><p>Since he, as the leader of a country, had already stated his name, the other side could not retreat without saying a word. If they gave a false name, if the Sorcerer King learned their real names, how would he react then?</p><br/><p><i>Stop toying with us!!!</i></p><br/><p>His expression had not changed, or rather, that was because it was a skinless and fleshless skull. Not only did he not have eyes, the empty orbits of his eyes were occupied only by dancing crimson flames, from which no emotions could be read. Yet, Jircniv could feel that evil grin widening.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you very much, and in truth we would have introduced ourselves as well. However, a dire emergency awaits our attention, so we must leave immediately. I am sure His Majesty will be more than happy to tell you about us afterwards.\u201d</p><br/><p>The emissaries rose from their seats.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so? What a shame. I do hope we will meet again. Please be well until then. Then, there is still the matter of the match, so please excuse me.\u201d</p><br/><p>With those parting words of mockery (probably), the Sorcerer King descended.</p><br/><p>As his shape vanished below, the emissaries glared at Jircniv.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow dare you set us up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t? No matter how you look at it, he knew everything about his place. Everything he has done is clearly to mock a bunch of fools who are moving exactly as he predicted \u2026How much of this did you tell him? How many people were you going to betray to save your own country? You must have asked him to use that illogically destructive spell too, did you not?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jircniv desperately cast his eyes toward the priests, seeking help.</p><br/><p>However, he did not see suspicion and doubt in their eyes, but hostility and disappointment.</p><br/><p>The Sorcerer King had struck a magnificent blow at the moment when it was most effective. It was one which would utterly cripple the Empire. It told the Empire that they had no choice left other than to betray humanity\u2015</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease believe me, I didn\u2019t sell this information to him\u2015\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Even if we did believe you, there\u2019s no way you can deny the fact that your entire operation has been compromised. Your Majesty, I am sad to say that we will not be meeting again.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, the emissaries made to leave, followed by the priests.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait! I forbid you to leave this room until I hear your opinions!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nimble and Baziwood drew their weapons and prepared to make their move.</p><br/><p>As Jircniv struggled to restore some life to his shattered heart, he stared at the two High Priests. The emissaries did not even look back as they left.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, tell me what the temples think. What do you think about the Sorcerer King!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026The Sorcerer King is a wicked, undead being, and we will not suffer it to call itself King.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Jircniv could answer, the High Priest of the God of Fire continued: \u201cHowever, we cannot defeat it in battle, so we must find some way to destroy it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBetray us if you will, oh Emperor, you who have been seduced by the power of evil.\u201d</p><br/><p>That statement, made by the High Priest of the Wind God, clearly illustrated their hostility towards Jircniv.</p><br/><p>This was extremely bad.</p><br/><p>The temples could not influence the government. However, they might well decide to excommunicate an Emperor who was in league with the universal enemy, the undead.</p><br/><p>He could not purge them, because the temples were in charge of healing, as well as the saviors of the peoples\u2019 souls.</p><br/><p>If he did that, the Empire would fall apart from the inside.</p><br/><p>To Jircniv, that single move by Ainz Ooal Gown felt like the sweep of the Grim Reaper\u2019s scythe. Even if he did nothing, the Empire would collapse. Then, the Sorcerous Kingdom would find some reason to come calling.</p><br/><p>If it was Jircniv doing it, he would use an excuse along the lines of \u201cThe country of our ally is in chaos, so we\u2019re sending troops over to help maintain public order.\u201d</p><br/><p>Judging by their reaction, the Slaine Theocracy would not criticize the Sorcerous Kingdom for doing such a thing. The Kingdom would not have the strength to do anything about it, while the City-State Alliance would take a while to make such a statement.</p><br/><p>What kind of enticements could he offer to remove the doubts from their hearts? Or rather, to keep to their commitments, even if they had doubts?</p><br/><p>Jircniv had always placed that topic foremost in his heart when he spoke to others in his capacity as Emperor. The simplest way to get people to take action was to appeal to their desires. Jircniv had grown up knowing this to be the right way to view things. There were so many humans who were ruled by desire for a pretty face that it was hardly surprising.</p><br/><p>However, at this moment, Jircniv could not find an answer.</p><br/><p>Now that others thought he had betrayed humanity to work with the undead, there was nothing he could offer them.</p><br/><p>All he could do was sincerely and earnestly tell his side of the story.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease allow me to say one last thing. That fellow\u2019s cunning surpasses mine. These developments might well be his doing. \u2026While I know I would not believe that so easily if I were in your shoes\u2026 I truly did not sell you out. And while you might not believe this either, as a human being I wish to tell you one thing. The Sorcerer King\u2019s reign is very merciful. The people of E-Rantel still live in peace.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut we have no idea how long that will last, do we?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps. But for the time being, at least, they are safe. If we embark on a war which we cannot win, our country will start going down the road to annihilation. So I hope you will think carefully and not make any rash moves.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two High Priests looked at each other.</p><br/><p>Then, their previous hostility toward Jircniv seemed to mellow a little.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026It seems we may have been too emotional. If that undead creature truly is as the rumors say he is, we cannot discard the possibility that all this might have been part of his plan. Then, may we meet again somewhere, if it is meant to be.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you. And before that, I have a request. No matter where, please watch that fellow fight in the arena. If you can see a way to defeat him, please tell me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jircniv lowered his head.</p><br/><p>Conspiracies included, there was no way to beat Ainz in a battle of wits. The human heart was the sole trump card left to those who wished to fight him evenly.</p><br/><p>Cheering came from downstairs, and Jircniv turned to look at it.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Good luck, Martial Lord. Oh, gods!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jircniv prayed in earnest for the victory of the Martial Lord.</p><br/><p><b>Part 3</b></p><br/><p>The much-awaited Imperial Capital.</p><br/><p>As he peered through the slight gap he had opened in the coach\u2019s window, Ainz felt a terrible sense of defeat.</p><br/><p>Life and energy abounded here.</p><br/><p>The faces of the people were bright. It was a bustling city, completely unlike the dreary Sorcerous Kingdom.</p><br/><p>And then, the sense of defeat soon faded away. After all, his city had been annexed recently. When a city was taken over by a new ruler, life would change. It was only natural that people would feel uneasy, leading to a temporary state of low energy.</p><br/><p>Punitto Moe had once taught Ainz about strategy games. When one conquered territory during a war, the happiness value of the people would plummet. Also\u2015</p><br/><p><i>\u2015What did he say about partisans appearing? The heck? Why would a large amount of weapons appear all of a sudden?</i></p><br/><p>The first part was completely unrelated to the second. He had the feeling that he had gotten something wrong somewhere.</p><br/><p>Since the game had nothing to do with YGGDRASIL, he had lost interest halfway. However, they should have been vaguely related, at least.</p><br/><p><i>He was probably talking about some kind of betrayal. Or maybe it was some form of player slang, huh\u2026 Partisans\u2026 seems to be a kind of polearm. So, when he talked about weapons being sold in large quantities, he was talking about a reason to fight? Citizen levies, maybe? Hm? Maybe they\u2019re fighting the new ruler, but that would be an uprising, right? Then it should have just been called a rebellion from the beginning. Why partisans? Well, it doesn\u2019t matter anyway\u2026</i></p><br/><p>The reason why there had been no rebellion in E-Rantel was because the Death Knights were patrolling to maintain public order. Or was it because the character of Momon had a calming effect on them? No, perhaps the root reason was because of his benevolent social policies.</p><br/><p><i>\u2026Nothing\u2019s better than a peaceful reign. Killing the goose for the golden eggs is utter foolishness. I guess I need to make the occasional concession like returning dropped items to an opponent after PKing them, perhaps.</i></p><br/><p>As he recalled the contents of \u201cPKing for Dummies\u201d, Ainz realised that he had gotten distracted, and hurriedly got his thoughts back on track.</p><br/><p><i>Hang on, I was thinking about high energy. Well, no matter what, I only rule one city, and this is the capital of the Empire, which has many cities, so the difference in their energy levels can\u2019t be helped. Even their populations are different\u2026 So I guess as long as the number of people increases, the Sorcerous Kingdom will also become more vibrant\u2026 I guess I need to focus on policies which encourage a population increase. Albedo can carry them out.</i></p><br/><p>After Ainz comforted himself, he decided upon a new direction to take, in his capacity as a ruler.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, ah, Your Majesty\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The man who was looking out the window as well spoke to him, and it brought Ainz back from his thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I fear to ask, Your Majesty, but is this not the Imperial Capital, Arwintar?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man \u2015 who had practically been kidnapped \u2015 asked that question in a trembling voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed it is. As expected of the Adventurer\u2019s Guildmaster, you recognized this place at a glance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank, thank you very \u2015 no, wait! I don\u2019t recall us passing through any checkpoints! Isn\u2019t this illegal immigration?\u201d</p><br/><p>That was, in fact, what had happened. Since they had used the [Gate] spell to directly transit to the Imperial Capital, they would not have passed through any checkpoints.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2015Details, details.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese aren\u2019t just details! A king crossing the border illegally into another country is an international incident!</p><br/><p><i>Jircniv did the same thing when he came to Nazarick.</i> Ainz did not say that, of course. Common sense would dictate that the Guildmaster was right and Ainz was wrong.</p><br/><p>After thinking as hard as he could, he still could not think of an explanation which Ainzach would accept. Instead, he ended up sighing at the man\u2019s surprising stubbornness. He had thought he would be the kind of man to say, \u201cWell, as long as you don\u2019t get caught\u201d.</p><br/><p>His opinion of the man changed a little.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Guildmaster, I have a very good relationship with El-Nix-dono. I\u2019ve even acceded to his requests in the past.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz recalled what had happened during that war.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I know it\u2019s hardly the same thing, but I\u2019m sure he would gladly approve if I just asked him. Granted, it would be after the fact\u2026 but wouldn\u2019t it be alright if the Emperor himself permitted it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf, if you put it that way\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe most important thing is that neither you nor I have brought anything bad with us. Doesn\u2019t that mean it\u2019s fine?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMuu,\u201d Ainzach mused.</p><br/><p>Ainz smiled in his heart, believing that he had convinced the other man.</p><br/><p>In truth, there were two reasons for their clandestine crossing of the border.</p><br/><p><i>If Jircniv knew about this, he would probably prepare a reception for me. He might be wary of Nazarick, but since I\u2019m the king of an allied country, he would have to welcome me at the front door. That would be very bad.</i></p><br/><p>The Emperor would surely host some kind of ceremony to welcome the king of an ally\u2019s country. That was something which Ainz, who was unfamiliar with the customs of noble society, had to avoid at all costs.</p><br/><p>If he became a laughingstock because of that, he would not be able to look the Guardians \u2015 who were working hard for the Sorcerous Kingdom \u2015 in the eye.</p><br/><p>There was also another reason.</p><br/><p><i>Now, I need to think about how to get Ainzach involved in this. Perhaps I should ask for his help like I did when I spun that story at the guild?</i></p><br/><p>The other reason was because he wanted to pressure Guildmaster Ainzach into his schemes.</p><br/><p>Ainz\u2019s objective in coming here was to recruit adventurers.</p><br/><p>He had already incorporated the Adventurer\u2019s Guild as a national organization. However, even if the shell was ready, filling it up would take a long time. This was quite bad for the Sorcerous Kingdom, since it only controlled one city and the number of adventurers they could draw on was completely insufficient. Using adventurers of other races \u2015 like Lizardmen, for example \u2015 was a matter for later. Right now, he had to increase the number of human adventurers.</p><br/><p>This was why he had to come here to do talent scouting. If it was not enough, he could recruit from the surrounding countries as well.</p><br/><p>However, this sort of recruitment was not easy, especially since Ainz was essentially going to do door-to-door sales \u2015 one of the hardest kinds of work in the sales business.</p><br/><p>According to Ainzach, adventurers were supposedly freelancers, but in truth, they were a form of national defense against monsters. Headhunting them aggressively would lead to stiff backlash.</p><br/><p>Of course, Ainz did not think he would lose, even if the Adventurer\u2019s Guilds of every single nation mounted a full-scale campaign against him. However, that would reduce the morale of any adventurers he did manage to recruit. It was quite easy to see how they would lose their motivation when seeing a conflict between their new allegiance and their former home.</p><br/><p>This was why he had to involve Ainzach \u2015 who understood Ainz\u2019s aims and concepts \u2015 in all of this. Surely things would go smoothly if he was the middleman. He had considered that Ainzach would flat-out refuse if he told him about this in E-Rantel, so he had dragged him along like this.</p><br/><p>In addition, he was also considering the fact that Ainzach would have something in common with the other side.</p><br/><p>That was a secret of salesmanship. People tended to gravitate towards those who were similar to them.</p><br/><p>Ainz \u2015 no, Suzuki Satoru had seen colleagues leverage the fact that they had been born in the same place or that they supported the same team as prospective clients to clinch a sale.</p><br/><p>Having once been Momon the adventurer, Ainz understood the life of the adventurer, to some extent. However, he had risen through the ranks so quickly that he could not say that he truly knew the hardships of being an adventurer. Thus, he had to let Ainzach \u2015 who was a veteran adventurer and also the Adventurer\u2019s Guildmaster \u2015 speak for him to improve the other side\u2019s closeness to him.</p><br/><p>In other words, the success of their little expedition to the Empire was reliant on Ainzach\u2019s performance.</p><br/><p><i>Still, the question is, how can I truly motivate Ainzach to help?</i></p><br/><p>If it was a matter of money, he could certainly pay. However, he did not imagine that such means would make Ainzach give his all.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>After commanding the driver, the coach began moving quietly. The driver in question was a creature which Ainz had summoned with what little gold he had left, a monster whose level was over 80, called Hanzo.</p><br/><p>Hanzo was a humanoid ninja-type monster, and was skilled in countering stealth. There were others of roughly the same level, such as Kashin Koji, which was skilled in illusion. Fuuma, which was skilled in hand-to-hand combat and special techniques, Tobi Kato, which was skilled with weapons, and so on.</p><br/><p>The interior of the coach clattered noisily as it travelled forward.</p><br/><p>Ainz had considered that using a heavily-enchanted coach would be very suspicious. Thus, he had chosen a regular stagecoach instead.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Then, Your Majesty. Since we have already arrived at the Imperial Capital, can you tell me what we will be doing here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainzach furrowed his brows.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will be recruiting adventurers for our country.\u201d</p><br/><p>A bitter expression crossed Ainzach\u2019s face. It was clear he was having trouble accepting that.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Could it be that you intend to persuade the adventurers of the Empire to join you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed. We will be headhunting in this country.\u201d</p><br/><p>While it had been done during a time of war, the fact that he had killed so many soldiers of the Kingdom would make it very difficult to attract the adventurers from the Kingdom to his camp. In addition, Albedo was visiting the Kingdom, so he could not make things difficult for her. That being the case, their allied country, the Empire, was the ideal option.</p><br/><p>The City-State Alliance was some distance away from here, according to Fluder\u2019s intelligence on the countries. However, after consulting Demiurge and Albedo, he decided that intervening there was not wise.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn what way will you proceed? I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainzach took a deep breath.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Your Majesty, I have engraved your views on adventurers deep into my heart. Thus, I wish to aid Your Majesty with all my strength. That said, I am still a man of the system, for the most part. I feel that having adventurers abandon everything they have known up till now would be very difficult. This is particularly true for the adventurers of the Empire.\u201d</p><br/><p>A sensation of new, fresh joy welled up within Ainz\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>Indeed, Ainz wanted opinions like this.</p><br/><p>It was not that the Guardians were at fault, but they took everything he said as a divine pronouncement and rushed to execute them. Thus, Ainz was frequently uneasy about whether or not he had given the right orders. Because of that, he had longed to hear someone oppose one of his statements. That way, he would know where the problems lay.</p><br/><p>Ainz\u2019s opinion of Ainzach went up by a notch.</p><br/><p>Still, he could not completely accept his views.</p><br/><p>Heaven only knew why, but all his subordinates seemed to think that the Sorcerer King Ainz Ooal Gown was a genius. Thus, Ainz could not say or do anything to betray that faith. He could not disappoint them.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026How baffling. The benefits ought to outweigh the drawbacks. I do not understand. It seems I do not know enough about adventurers.\u201d</p><br/><p>His face \u2015 which showed no emotion \u2015 was a great help, because nobody could tell he was lying. It was the ultimate poker face.</p><br/><p>At this point, Ainz stopped for a moment and looked Ainzach straight in the eyes. He could not imply that he was waiting for the man\u2019s response.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat would you do, if it was up to you? Is there a proposal which would be attractive enough to make adventurers who have already picked out a home base change their minds?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Your Majesty, must we start headhunting right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre we going to start trying to entice the adventurers of the Imperial Capital right away?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz cupped his chin with a hand as he thought.</p><br/><p>If possible, he would like to do so as soon as possible. However, if he could not, he did not mind waiting. After all, the aim was to sing the praises of the Sorcerous Kingdom.</p><br/><p>Heteromorphs did not possess the concept of a lifespan. In that sense, there was more than enough time.</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed, it is not particularly urgent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, should we not lay a strong foundation first? We should build the desired organization within the Sorcerous Kingdom, and then make various other preparations as needed. Once the shell is ready, we can fill it at leisure, is that wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is an excellent suggestion, one which I have considered before. However, it poses a problem of its own. If we do not estimate the contents before we begin to build, the finished vessel may be too large or too small\u2026 Would you care to try?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn-indeed, that task is beyond me. After all, I remain unsure of how Your Majesty wishes to nurture adventurers, and I do not understand the extent of your plans for the Sorcerous Kingdom.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed. Frankly speaking, I am still feeling things out. In particular \u2015 I know you are interested in my words, but I do not know how many hearts they can move. In order to observe their reactions, I have come to the Empire to attempt a test recruitment, and to see the outcome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see\u2026 as expected of Your Majesty, you have already planned so far ahead. I am ashamed of my shallow thinking.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCertainly not. You and I are different beings. Because of that, I might make a mistake when it comes to the reactions of human beings. For all I know, I might say something which upsets others. Please tell me if such a situation occurs. In that respect, I will need a helper\u2026 Ainzach.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, I\u2019ll be counting on you in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainzach paused to think for about a second, and then he bowed his head deeply.</p><br/><p>It looked just like how the Guardians of Nazarick did it.</p><br/><p>Ainz graciously nodded as he reflected on his previous words.</p><br/><p><i>In any case, can I really leave the task of appealing to the Empire\u2019s adventurers to Ainzach alone?</i></p><br/><p>This was a very important point.</p><br/><p>He could do the presentation himself if need be, but it was not because he particularly liked it. If someone was more adept at a task and more capable, then he should hand it to them. However\u2015</p><br/><p><i>\u2015I can\u2019t leave it all to him. If a problem comes up, I ought to deal with it as his superior.</i></p><br/><p>He did not want to be a bad boss. Ainz clung to that determination. Just then, he realized that Ainzach seemed to have fallen into contemplation.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Your Majesty, could it be that you do not intend to limit yourself to the current crop of adventurers, but to incorporate the adventurers of the future into your organization and have them explore the unknown world?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was my intention.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWith that in mind, I feel trying to persuade the present batch of adventurers will be very difficult. However, it might be possible to have those people who wish to become adventurers come to our Sorcerous Kingdom. That is to say, we will gather the hatchlings and then raise them.\u201d</p><br/><p>While adventurers knew no borders, the people who became adventurers belonged to a certain country. Ainz had thought of this point as well, but since this man \u2015 who was more familiar with this world than Ainz \u2015 shared his opinion, then it should be fine.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. Then, what should we do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe strong have always been admired. Thus, may I ask how your Majesty feels about showing his might as a form of advertisement?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>And what would that accomplish?</i> Ainz thought.</p><br/><p>That said, publicity was very important. After all, the reason why he was founding his own Adventurer\u2019s Guild was to spread the name of the Sorcerous Kingdom of Ainz Ooal Gown.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026So I have to show my might and do what adventurers do?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>All I have to do is make an Empire-brand Momon, then,</i> Ainz thought. However, Ainzach shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cOn that note, Your Majesty. This is the Imperial Capital. How would you feel about displaying your might in the arena?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHoh\u2026? That sounds interesting. Elaborate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2666 \u2666 \u2666</p><br/><p>The coach stopped in a spacious courtyard.</p><br/><p>Momon and Nabe had walked the streets of the Imperial Capital, but Ainz had never seen such a huge personal home during that time. Not even in E-Rantel had he seen a mansion more impressive than this.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this the home of the arena\u2019s owner? This is quite an impressive place.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainzach\u2019s response to Ainz\u2019s question was along the lines of \u201cThat might be stretching it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe arena itself is state property. People rent it for events, so calling them \u2018promoters\u2019 might be more accurate. The person who lives here is among the most powerful of those people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see\u2026 a friend of yours?\u201d</p><br/><p>It would be good if that was the case. Regretfully, Ainzach shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are many events in the arena, and sometimes adventurers end up fighting monsters. I\u2019ve only met this person a few times, when I captured those monsters and shipped them here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so. Still, it ended up being quite useful indeed, so I must thank you for your connection. That said, what sort of monsters did you capture around the outskirts of E-Rantel?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainzach had an uncomfortable look on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe captured the undead from the Katze Plains. The undead didn\u2019t need food, so they didn\u2019t incur additional expenses after we captured them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHoh. Good eye. You do know your stuff, after all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so? I don\u2019t strike myself as a very likeable person\u2026 still, Your Majesty. I fear to offend you, but is it really alright to speak of capturing your kind?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz looked straight at Ainzach.</p><br/><p>What on earth was he on about?</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause they\u2019re undead\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh, I see \u2015 well, there are many kinds of undead. I do not count all undead as my kin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cForgive my disrespect\u2026 Then, may I inquire as to what type of undead Your Majesty might be? If it does not offend, of course.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am an Overlord. Have you heard of them before?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy deepest apologies, but I have not. I was not inclined toward my studies, so I do not know.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Well, that\u2019s to be expected,</i> Ainz thought.</p><br/><p>In YGGDRASIL, there were several types of monsters in the Overlord family: the Overlord Wiseman, which was skilled in magic, the Overlord Kronos Master, which could use time-related special abilities, the Overlord General, which was adept at controlling armies of the undead, among others. Even the weakest of those was at least level 80.</p><br/><p>He had a rough grasp of the strength of this world and the amount of strength one needed to be considered powerful in this world. That being the case, the appearance of an undead being like an Overlord would cause a huge disturbance, particularly because the undead did not age, so they would continue ruling the land for all eternity until it was defeated.</p><br/><p>In other words, the fact that nothing like this had happened implied that there were no Overlords here.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so. Well, I intend to send adventurers into the unknown reaches of the world to collect information of that sort. It would be quite troublesome if others of my kind were around, bearing a hatred for the living. Do you understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainzach\u2019s eyes went wide, and he nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is as you say. I now thoroughly understand the true nature of adventurers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed. Consider me an undead being that is an exception to the rules. I understand the value of humanity, so I will not engage in meaningless slaughter. However, other Overlords might not think the same way, no?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that really the case?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat remains to be seen. I do not know if I am the exception, or if my species is an exception in itself. However, should we not assume the worst-case scenario and prepare accordingly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026It is as Your Majesty says. I shall engrave it into my heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainzach nodded.</p><br/><p>If there were traces of one having appeared, and having being defeated \u2015 it might have had some involvement with whoever brainwashed Shalltear. No, one could not rule out an Overlord being dominated the same way Shalltear had been.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, I shall go secure an appointment for the meeting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainzach got off the coach. After Ainz watched him leave, he took out his mask and put it on. He could go around barefaced in E-Rantel, but this was the Imperial Capital \u2015 and he had crossed borders illegally to be here \u2015 so at the very least it was better to hide his true face. His robe was also something that was more subdued.</p><br/><p>Although it meant that his personal equipment would go down by one class, it could not be helped. After all, Ainz only had one set of divine-class robes. While he still had the things left behind by his friends, in the end, the armor his friends left behind was more customised than their weapons. Therefore, it was not so much that he could not equip them, but that he could not bring out their full power, being that he could not make use of the large amounts of data that were used to benefit their abilities. That being the case, it was still better for Ainz to use the items which had been made for him, even if they were a little weaker.</p><br/><p>After swapping out his gear, a knocking came from the door of the carriage, followed by Ainzach\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>It would seem less than five minutes had passed.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy deepest apologies, Your Majesty.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?</p><br/><p>\u201cI regret to say that today does not seem convenient. The other party hopes we can come again tomorrow. However, I believe we can force our way in to convey Your Majesty\u2019s words to his ears. What shall we do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no need for that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Forcing an unsolicited meeting during a busy period would not endear anyone to him. On the contrary, when one looked at it from a business\u2019 point of view, the very fact that they had come uninvited and not been chased away, but given a time to visit again could be considered a major accomplishment.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, we\u2019ll come again tomorrow. Good thing there\u2019s been a lot of free time lately \u2015 what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz realised Ainzach was goggling at him, and so he asked him why.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing. I just felt that Your Majesty is a truly generous person\u2026 after all, there are those nobles who look down on merchants\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd you believed I would insist on a meeting?\u201d</p><br/><p>The fact that Ainz did not answer immediately told him \u201cI did believe that\u201d in a way that words could not convey.</p><br/><p><i>Would that be the right thing to do from a ruler\u2019s point of view,</i> Ainz wondered. While it seemed a bit too late to think of that now, Ainz Ooal Gown was a king. If that was what a ruler ought to do, then he needed to do it, even if it seemed strange to Suzuki Satoru.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is my first time occupying a position over humans. Should I not do so, if it was appropriate?\u201d</p><br/><p>An uncomfortable look appeared on Ainzach\u2019s face again:</p><br/><p>\u201cI am unsure, Your Majesty. I have never met the King, so I cannot say if it is true or not. Although, personally speaking, I prefer Your Majesty\u2019s point of view. That said, high-ranking nobles might consider such forcefulness to be appropriate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuman society is so complicated.\u201d</p><br/><p>For some reason, Ainzach smiled warmly to Ainz after he muttered that.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt might well be as Your Majesty says. There are many complicated things indeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Their chuckling filled the coach.</p><br/><p>Ainz clenched his right fist where nobody could see. It would seem Ainzach was no longer so guarded. He was sure of it.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2015Then, did you tell him them that I would be coming tomorrow as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I did not do that. I wanted to hear what you thought of it first, Your Majesty. Or am I permitted to use Your Majesty\u2019s name?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026It\u2019s fine as long as they are not humans who will make a fuss. Since they are friends of yours, I will leave it to your own discretion.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood. Then I shall not disclose it for now.\u201d</p><br/><p>After discussing details like the time and so on, Ainzach stepped down from the coach again.</p><br/><p>Ainz felt a bit guilty about using him as a runner. While he knew this was not a world where seniority mattered, Suzuki Satoru was a working man, and it bothered him to order an older person around.</p><br/><p><i>Now I understand why people dislike having old subordinates.</i></p><br/><p>He would not have had a problem ordering someone around from a completely different company. For instance, if Ainzach was from the Empire, he could point and dictate with no problems at all. The reason why Ainz could not do so was because he had come to see Ainzach as one of his subordinates.</p><br/><p><i>I need to reward him appropriately. The people of Nazarick don\u2019t ask for payment, but they\u2019re an exception. If I forget this, they\u2019ll think of me as a terrible ruler. I must not become the boss of a black-hearted enterprise.</i></p><br/><p>Ainz vowed that to the voice of Herohero in his mind.</p><br/><p><i>Although, when it comes to rewarding Ainzach\u2026 how much should I pay him, as a king? The same as a mithril-ranked adventurer? No, there should be a duty allowance as well\u2026 so another 5% on top of that? Is there anyone I can ask about how much is appropriate?</i></p><br/><p>He could discuss it with Demiurge or Albedo, but it was unclear whether the two of them had any idea of what kind of payment was appropriate. He had the feeling they would reply with something along the lines of \u201cHe should be glad to serve you, Ainz-sama\u201d.</p><br/><p><i>As expected\u2026 I need to find a wise human. Fluder said he was very confident in his magical knowledge, but knew next to nothing about other matters.</i></p><br/><p>Nazarick was arguably invincible, but he felt uneasy about his lack of knowledge concerning human society.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026So I\u2019ll start by using him until someone better comes along, then? I guess agreeing with Demiurge\u2019s proposal was the right choice. Then again, I had no intention of denying him when he brought it up\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>(TL Note: This part is fairly complex; Ainz uses a saying here which refers to taking the first step with something sub-par. However, Ainz has mis-stated one word, going from \u3088\u308a\u3081\u3088 to \u3088\u308a\u3081\u3088. )</p><br/><p>As Ainz drifted off into contemplation once more, someone knocked on the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cForgive the delay, Your Majesty.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>It\u2019s not as though I was waiting for you.</i> However, Ainz decided to allow Ainzach to continue, with a magnanimous attitude that best fitted a ruler.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs you have desired, the appointment has been made to meet at ten in the morning tomorrow, Your Majesty.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUmu. Then, there\u2019s just the matter of waiting until tomorrow\u2026 Next, I shall use teleportation magic to send you to E-Rantel. Relax and accept the spell. [Greater Teleportation].\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainzach\u2019s body disappeared in an instant.</p><br/><p>The [Greater Teleportation] would safely transport him to the outermost of E-Rantel\u2019s triple gates. Even if there was someone at the destination, the spell would deposit him at the nearest safe location, so there was no need to verify the destination with magic.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, I should contact that guy with [Message].\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz muttered to himself. This was a distasteful task, so he did that to pull himself together.</p><br/><p>He was sending the [Message] to Fluder, who had offered everything to him. The reason why he had been dragging his feet on giving the man what he had promised was because he did not feel confident he could actually give that old man what he wanted.</p><br/><p>Fluder wanted Ainz to teach him everything he knew about magic.</p><br/><p>Yet, Ainz\u2019s power did not come from the study of magic.</p><br/><p>Perhaps if this was YGGDRASIL, he might be qualified to talk about magic. Sadly, the magic system of this world worked slightly different from that of YGGDRASIL.</p><br/><p>Why was it that they learned the same spells in different ways? He had asked himself that question many times, but he could not find an answer. In addition, there was a veritable mountain of other unanswered questions. In the worst-case scenario, he had to consider that he might not be able to use his powers from YGGDRASIL.</p><br/><p>Perhaps he could find the answer by using the level-draining option of the super-tier spell [Wish Upon A Star]. In this world, that spell could alter reality itself, and by draining multiple levels, it could fulfil a greater wish.</p><br/><p>However, that was a very risky gamble.</p><br/><p>It was unknown if he would find the answer even if he used it. It was very likely he would just be wasting effort. More importantly, he was afraid to use a spell which qualified as a trump card. Of course, it would be a different matter if he had a way to obtain large amounts of experience, but sadly, he had not discovered such a way so far.</p><br/><p>Although he had no lungs, Ainz went \u201cHaaah~\u201d as he sighed. He had the attitude of a salesman who was prepared to to apologize for failing to deliver the requested goods to a client as he cast the [Message] spell.</p><br/><p>\u201cFluder Paradyne. It is I, Ainz Ooal Gown.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once he reached him, he continued speaking the pre-arranged words.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were born in Belmous Village. Your earliest contact with magic was through the spellcaster in your village.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300eOhhhh! It is you, Teacher! Long have I awaited this!\u300f</p><br/><p>He could feel the gratitude from Fluder.</p><br/><p>Those pre-arranged words were a form of code, because Fluder had said that there was no way to tell if the person on the other side of a [Message] was a friend or a stranger. Thus, they had arranged to verify their identity by mentioning the (already-changed) name of his village and his memory.</p><br/><p>Still, even after doing that, Fluder\u2019s doubts about the [Message] spell remained.</p><br/><p><i>He\u2019s got it pretty bad.</i> That said, there was not much Ainz could do about it.</p><br/><p>Ainz made his reply, feeling slightly intimidated by the burning intensity of Fluder\u2019s enthusiasm.</p><br/><p>\u201cForgive the slight delay. I believe it is time to teach you magic, as we agreed. Are you free now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300eOf course! I will make as much time as needed for you, Teacher!\u300f</p><br/><p>He wanted to say, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to try so hard\u201d, but Fluder\u2019s enthusiasm about magic was the truest expression of his character. In the face of this magic-crazed madman, Ainz could not help but feel a little tongue-tied, as a regular person.</p><br/><p>As he considered this great task, which seemed like settling a claim by a difficult customer, his stomach began to ache.</p><br/><p><i>\u2026My stomach must hurt the worst of anyone in the Imperial Capital.</i></p><br/><p>Still, he could not delay it any further.</p><br/><p>Before teleporting to Fluder\u2019s room, Ainz decided to verify his destination with a divination spell.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll right. I shall now cast [Greater Teleportation] to reach your chambers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300eOhhh! Not [Teleportation], but [Greater Teleportation]! Dare I ask which tier of magic it belongs to?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Let\u2019s leave that for later. The [Message] will not last forever. Neither do I have levels in commander-type classes\u2026 Still, I would like to ask you something before that. What sort of anti-divination countermeasures have you taken? What spells have you cast? How did you cast them? Did you do anything to ward against teleportation?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300eNone, none at all, I have not taken any such measures.\u300f</p><br/><p>Ainz\u2019s non-existent brows twitched as Fluder replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t doing nothing at all a little careless\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>In other words, everything he said in Fluder\u2019s room might well be leaked to a third party.</p><br/><p>\u300eMy sincerest apologies. However, I am not adept in that field of magic.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, you should use magic items to substitute for that, right? I have seen many magic items in the Imperial Capital, all purportedly made by you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz recalled what he had seen when he first came to the Imperial Capital. He had been startled by the fact that they had things like refrigerators on sale.</p><br/><p>\u300eIt is as you say, but as you must surely know, one must know a related spell in order to make a magic item. For instance, one must know the [Fireball] spell to make a flaming weapon. However, only a few people are willing to learn anti-divination spells\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Ainz muttered.</p><br/><p>In YGGDRASIL, one could normally only learn three spells per level. A level 20 character would thus be able to learn a maximum of 60 spells. It would be quite difficult to incorporate anti-divination magic into such a limited selection of spells.</p><br/><p>Perhaps those who were not in the know might think 60 was a sizable sum, but if Ainz was limited to 60 spells from the 3rd tier of magic, he would probably have to spend all day worrying over his choices.</p><br/><p>This was because he had to consider future uses, whether or not he would change his class and so on. There were many things which needed to be planned for and anticipated .</p><br/><p>From that point of view, his rebuke of Fluder was petty and sad.</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed, I misspoke. It is as you say. Divination magic would necessarily be a lower priority when studying offensive and defensive spells.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the game, he could say, \u201cI\u2019ll learn this, so I\u2019ll leave that to you\u201d and easily settle things. However, the choice of spells was a life-changing decision to the people of this world. It would take a very brave person to learn an unpopular spell.</p><br/><p>In addition, the divination school of spells was quite deep. One needed to anticipate the means that the foe would use to collect information.</p><br/><p>Simply put, becoming a divination specialist was something which one would stake their lives on.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Then I shall give you the anti-divination item I possess. Use that to ward yourself in future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300eYes\uff01\u300f</p><br/><p>Even without looking, he could tell that Fluder\u2019s head was deeply lowered. For all he knew, he might even be genuflecting.</p><br/><p>\u300eI have certainly received your loving words, Teacher!\u300f</p><br/><p>Ainz had originally planned to give him a decent item, but the thought of that pained his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, ahhh\u2026 Then I shall scry your room now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz cast his spell on Fluder\u2019s chambers.</p><br/><p>He looked down upon the genuflecting Fluder.</p><br/><p>Then, he decided to check for magical auras, and as expected of Fluder, there were many different colors in his room. However, none of them looked like a dangerous color which would impede teleportation. After verifying that, he cast [Greater Teleportation].</p><br/><p>His field of view changed, showing that he had successfully teleported to Fluder\u2019s room. Though there had been no delays, and he did not sense anyone spying on him, and he was quite certain that he had not jumped into the enemy\u2019s base, he still took a quick look around himself.</p><br/><p>In truth, there was no need to be so worried. However the brief period of vulnerability after teleportation was when it was easiest to be attacked. These protective actions \u2015 to defend against being PKed \u2015 had been long drilled into Suzuki Satoru\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u201cI bid you welcome, my Teacher.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Raise your head,\u201d Ainz commanded Fluder. In all honesty, there was no need for him to go that far.</p><br/><p>That sort of loyalty \u2015 or rather, his thirst for knowledge that led to a desire to obey \u2015 was abnormal.</p><br/><p>It was quite similar to how the people of Nazarick acted. Although Ainz had finally started getting used to that sort of thing, seeing it from someone he barely knew made him want to back away.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeaking while standing is not good. I\u2019ll take a seat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! Everything I have is yours, Teacher. Please, sit anywhere you like!\u201d</p><br/><p>Complex feelings of whether or not to get used to this ran through Ainz\u2019s heart as he sat on the sofa. However, Fluder did not take the seat opposite him. Instead, he remained as he was, kneeling on the ground with his head raised.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Have a seat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs, is it really alright? That is, for me to sit in the same way as you, Teacher.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026You should have disciples too, right? Do you treat them this way as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>This sort of sports-team attitude alarmed Ainz, which prompted his question. In response, Fluder shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot like that, but the difference between myself and you is like that between the heavens and the earth, Teacher. I fear to even begin to mention myself in the same breath as\u2015\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2015It\u2019s fine. I grant you permission to sit down. Come. have a seat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>After he made sure Fluder was seated, Ainz thought, <i>my belly really hurts</i> as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, how is the matter that I as\u2015\u201d</p><br/><p>He changed his mind halfways through the word \u201casked\u201d.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2015that I <i>ordered</i> you to handle? That is to say, making a written record of the Empire\u2019s information on the various countries?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! Most of the information pertaining to the neighboring countries has already been completed. However\u2015\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened? Is there a problem?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! Or rather, I should say, as expected of the Emperor.\u201d</p><br/><p>A look of pride crossed his face. It was the expression a teacher might have toward an outstanding pupil.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe seems to have noticed my treachery.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was only natural for employees to swear not to reveal their former company\u2019s secrets before job-hopping. With that in mind, Ainz was a villain for making Fluder feed him sensitive information on the Empire.</p><br/><p>However, Ainz knew well that he did not run a company, but a country. Nothing was off-limits for the sake of his nation\u2019s prosperity \u2015 for the happiness of the people who belonged to the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick.</p><br/><p>Ainz held no grudge against Jircniv. However, that meant nothing in comparison to the well-being of his own country. If his misfortune made the Sorcerous Kingdom prosper, then he would simply have to suffer.</p><br/><p>That said, Ainz still preferred coexistence and mutual prosperity over conflict.</p><br/><p>Punitto Moe once said something about Mr. Nash and prisoner\u2019s conditions and something along those lines, but the gist of it was, if opportunities were unlimited, cooperation would reap the greatest benefits for all parties involved.</p><br/><p>(TL Note: Ainz is getting it wrong again \u2013 see Nash Equilibrium and the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma)</p><br/><p>Ainz knew that international relations were basically a matter of each party using the other, but he wanted to maintain a good relationship with Jircniv.</p><br/><p><i>I kept the number of Imperial casualties to a minimum as the price of poaching Fluder, so we\u2019re probably even on that count. I feel a sense of closeness to him now. It must be because of all the times I\u2019ve spied on him.</i></p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Is something the matter, Teacher?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEr, um, nothing. Just thinking about certain matters.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? My deepest apologies for interrupting your thoughts, Teacher!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to apologise. I am here today because of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOhhh! Thank you very much, Teacher!\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Why is he thanking me so vigorously?</i> Though Ainz was puzzled, he eventually managed to get the topic back on track.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2015 yes, the fact that you\u2019ve been turned. Well, it\u2019s alright for you to be exposed, but there is a problem. That is to say, your safety.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOhh! To think you would actually be worried about the safety of someone like me, Teacher!\u201d</p><br/><p>Why did this old man have to overreact to everything? The basic duty of a boss was to look out for the well-being of anyone he did not intend to discard from the beginning. Or did they do things differently in the Empire?</p><br/><p><i>If it\u2019s the latter, that would be scary\u2026 Well, I might kill people who got in my way, but killing someone who was once my subordinate is still\u2026</i></p><br/><p>\u201cFluder, that\u2019s right, do not get too excited. It would be odd if anyone around you noticed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat will not be a problem. This floor is exclusively for my use. Nobody else is around.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had come here before. That said, this tower was quite large, so it was no wonder the greatest magic caster of the Empire was allowed an entire floor to himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cBack to the matter of your personal safety. Has anyone tried to kill you after your treachery came to light?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing of the sort. However, my responsibilities have steadily decreased, and while the Emperor frequently came to consult me in the past, he has not summoned me ever since he returned from the glorious domain that you rule, Teacher.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see\u2026 Then, Fluder. Do you want to come to my side?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOhhh! Gladly!\u201d</p><br/><p><i>He answered right away\u2026</i></p><br/><p>\u201cThen, after considering your profession \u2015 no, before that, there is something I must do. It concerns your reward.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, Ainz exhaled, and then reached into his pocket dimension. He had rehearsed the flow of the conversation which would follow many times, poking fun at the words even as he corrected them.</p><br/><p>Although he had no way to be sure if Fluder would react as Ainz imagined, he had put in enough practice already.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs agreed, I shall now impart a portion of my knowledge to you. Take and study this book.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz handed a tome called The Book of the Dead to him.</p><br/><p>It was a fairly ancient volume, which gave off a musty smell. Surprisingly enough, the book itself was very sturdy, with no trace of being worm-eaten.</p><br/><p>Fluder accepted the book Ainz offered with trembling hands. Ainz was glad that he was undead. If he was still human, the book might be wobbling nonstop from nervousness.</p><br/><p>Fluder\u2019s goal was to plumb the abyss of magic, but Ainz did not know what the abyss of magic was. He could teach him about YGGDRASIL, but the abyss of magic or whatnot was another topic entirely.</p><br/><p>That said, not giving it to him would be a betrayal of his loyalty. One had to repay good unto good and reward loyal service. Thus, Ainz had given him a book from his collection, which seemed the most likely to hold the secrets of magical knowledge. The parts he had flipped through seemed to contain something about magic which he could not understand.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, please excuse me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fluder reached out to the book, and that delighted expression of his soon twisted into despair after flipping though a few pages.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2015What\u2019s the matter? Is this not what you sought?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz suppressed his unease as he asked that question. It was fine even if it was not what he wanted. He had already practiced for that eventuality.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it is nothing like that. I simply cannot understand this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz took the book from Fluder, flipped through it, and stopped at a certain page.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis chapter concerns the transformation of the dead into souls; specifically, the section about differentiation.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was written in Japanese, so obviously Fluder could not understand it. However \u2015</p><br/><p><i>This looks more like a setting book for a fantasy world than a fantasy novel. The hell is this differentiation stuff. And then there\u2019s souls as clouds and so on. It looks really hard and I can\u2019t wrap my brain around it at all. Feels like I can only scratch the surface\u2026 Could it be that I can\u2019t understand this book, even though I can read it?</i></p><br/><p>Books were like the occult, or rather, this book was pretty much an occult volume. To Suzuki Satoru, who had no knowledge in this field, all he saw was a collection of scribblings. Still, all this seemed to have been taken from some kind of mythology. If Tabula Smaragdina was around, he would probably be able to explain it to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cOhhh!\u201d</p><br/><p>The sense of guilt in Ainz\u2019s heart grew as he watched Fluder look at him with joyful eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed\u2026 Well, I cannot give this to you because I only have one set, but give this a try.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz placed a pair of glasses on the book and handed it to him. Fluder put it on and hurriedly flipped through the pages.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis, this is! It\u2019s saying that souls are entities like the foam left by the waves of this great world, and so whether great or small, they are fundamentally the same. That meeeeaaaannnns!!!\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Hieh~ he\u2019s gone mad.</i></p><br/><p>Even Ainz was startled, to the point where he nearly shrank back.</p><br/><p>The way Fluder\u2019s eyes were wide open and bloodshot, his breathing like a wild beast\u2019s, made it seem as though he was about to pounce on someone.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow, how is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fluder\u2019s eyes pivoted and stared straight at Ainz.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis, this is amazing, Teacher! This is the lore that I sooooooooooouuuuught! Hyaaaaah!\u201d</p><br/><p>The alarm he felt at the old man\u2019s mania exceeded a predetermined threshold, and Ainz swiftly calmed down again.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2015Is that so. Then, return me the glasses.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWha! But, this..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cConsider the translation of that book to be your training. Once you can understand and digest it, you will be able to set foot in a higher domain. It would be pointless for you to use these glasses.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could this be\u2026 Then, may I be allowed to give this book a once-over first?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne page should still be all right. But if you continue after that, it will negatively affect your growth.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fluder closed the book shut with a <i>patan</i>, and then closed his eyes.</p><br/><p>After several seconds, he opened his eyes and spoke. His voice had returned to normal.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood. I will abide by your teachings, oh Teacher. May I seek your aid if there are matters I do not understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUmu. As long as it is within my power to answer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fluder removed the glasses and returned them to Ainz.</p><br/><p><i>Excellent! I won\u2019t hear anything from Fluder for a while now. Ah, I need to instruct him about this first. That\u2026 how shall I say this\u2026</i></p><br/><p>Ainz struggled to pry open the vaults of his memory. Then, in solemn, heavy tones \u2015 which made one think of the voice a leader would have \u2015 Ainz spoke:</p><br/><p>\u201cFluder.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have entrusted you with this book of arcana because I trust you. You must never hand it to a third party. The same applies to any notes you make to study it. Nothing about this book can be allowed to spread.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is hardly a need to tell you the reason for that, but this is knowledge that surpasses what humans can comprehend. It would be very troublesome if others came to learn of it\u2026 Although someone of your talent might not be beyond salvation. I do not want to have to clean up behind you ten years down the road.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut of course. I will not leak any of the knowledge I have obtained from you to others. I swear it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2015I trust you, Fluder. Do not disappoint me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fluder got up from his chair and knelt on the ground.</p><br/><p>He wanted to say that there was no need to go to that extent, but this too was proof of how effective his air of majesty had been. Ainz could not help but feel proud that his hours of acting and vocalization practice had been put to good use.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough. Since you understand, I shall say no more. Return to your seat. Still, it will be very difficult for you to decipher an unknown language without any help. Do you have some way of overcoming that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! I can use a translation spell, though its efficacy is very limited. I believe that with that, I can slowly decipher the text.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally now. Really now! Marvellous.\u201d</p><br/><p>This answer was exactly what Ainz wanted to hear. By slowly giving him the appropriate practice, he would be able to buy himself time. In addition, a problem like that would not be enough to make Fluder give up.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I shall hand this to you\u2026 no, that\u2019s it. I will lend you a box for you to store it in. I do not think that you will treat it lightly, but someone might wish to steal it from you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz pulled a box out of his pocket space. It was an item of the same grade which he used to store his personal notebook.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce you store the book in here, even if this box is stolen, it will take quite some time to open it. Of course, it will all be for nothing if someone overhears the command word to open the box\u2026 so be careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, Teacher! I will never do anything like that!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz shifted his gaze from Fluder \u2015 who was caressing the book in delight \u2015 to the ceiling. Now, what would he talk about next?</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, that\u2019s right. The matter of your treachery coming to light, and thus you coming over to me. When can you leave?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Teacher wishes it, I can leave at any time. I have no attachments to this country.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz mentally furrowed his brows.</p><br/><p>He had no idea what to say to someone who could casually discard his position of trust. He might well do the same thing to Ainz in the future.</p><br/><p>Ainz marked Fluder down several points with a red pen in his heart\u2019s ledger.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Then, Fluder. I wish to have you participate in the magical research of the Sorcerous Kingdom. However, your spells will not be put into circulation. They will only be shared with me and those whom I trust. Can you bear it? Can you forsake your desire for fame?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere will be no problem at all. The only thing I desire is to glimpse the secrets of magic. I desire nothing else.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz studied Fluder in earnest, the man who could make such a statement.</p><br/><p>Ainz had no ability to evaluate a person\u2019s character. As human beings, it was obvious that Fluder \u2015 a genius sage who had lived far beyond the span of a normal human being and who was deeply involved in the operations of the vast nation called the Empire \u2015 was superior to him. There was no way for him to see through any attempt by Fluder to deceive him.</p><br/><p>However, being unable to see through such things and not trying to see through such things were two different matters. With that attitude in mind, Ainz stared at Fluder, and in the end he simply said, \u201cGood.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will entrust you with all the powers and privileges of your office once you arrive in the Sorcerous Kingdom. I also intend to help you with magical research as much as possible. Then\u2015\u201d</p><br/><p>Now, there would be one more person helping Nazarick, beyond the Bareares. If he could obtain the woman which Demiurge and Albedo had recommended, Nazarick would be further strengthened.</p><br/><p>He had to increase his power as much as possible, so long as he could not see the true face of his enemy.</p><br/><p>The enemy possessed a World-Class Item, so he had to obtain a power aside from YGGDRASIL\u2019s as soon as possible. He had to assume that anything he could do, the enemy could as well.</p><br/><p>However, there was one more problem.</p><br/><p>That would be, how would he protect the Empire.</p><br/><p>Demiurge felt that the Empire was a potential enemy, but Ainz did not think so.</p><br/><p>Although the future was unclear, the use of force alone in world conquest was not a wise decision. If the Sorcerous Kingdom was painted as a nation which annihilated everyone who stood against it, countries which could have been friends would probably end up as enemies.</p><br/><p>That being the case, why not form a deep friendship with his fellow dictator Jircniv, and send that message to their subordinates?</p><br/><p><i>This way, I\u2019ll be able to minimize the force Demiurge and the others use in world conquest. What a brilliant plan. More than the alliance of nations, or the alliance of guilds\u2026 friendship?</i></p><br/><p>The shapes of his heteromorphic friends appeared in Ainz\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p><i>Still, how should I make friends with him? Giving people things isn\u2019t the right way to make friends, right\u2026 Thus, protecting the Empire, the most precious thing to Jircniv, should be the best way. It\u2019s quite likely that my enemies will set their sights upon it.</i></p><br/><p>He put himself in the role of the people who brainwashed Shalltear. If they used the methods Ainz used, then\u2015</p><br/><p><i>In the worst-case scenario, they might use [Ia Shub-Niggurath] on the Imperial Capital. Everyone would think I did it, regardless of the actual culprit\u2026 Then, they would spread that news throughout the world. That would greatly decrease the Sorcerous Kingdom\u2019s influence.</i></p><br/><p>Ainz recalled his YGGDRASIL days.</p><br/><p>It was foolish to directly fight a powerful guild, so it was quite common to instigate wars with other guilds to weaken the powerful guild\u2019s influence. These methods would probably be applicable here. Ainz would probably do so if placed in that situation, and so it was very likely his foe would do the same thing.</p><br/><p>In order to prevent this sort of thing from happening, Ainz considered allowing Fluder to spread rumors that he could not use that spell again (a lie, naturally). However, Fluder could no longer be used, so he had to consider some other method.</p><br/><p><i>This is close to forbidding the carrying of palm-sized dangerous objects\u2026 As expected, I\u2019ll need to discuss the matter with Demiurge, maybe order him to think of a way to deal with this. However, would he not think it strange? Ahh, how troublesome, I can\u2019t figure it out.</i></p><br/><p>If only he could hand everything to those two. However, if he did that, it would damage his image as an absolute ruler. He had to think of a way to solve his problems while maintaining his position.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, what is wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Fluder, I intend to protect the Empire for some time. Do you have any ideas?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026May I know why you ask?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cConquering it would be easy, but I have no interest in standing atop a pile of rubble. I wish to keep the Empire intact, and so I would like to prevent the loss of fighting power that would result when they lose you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fluder\u2019s wrinkles deepened.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is difficult to answer that question immediately. I believe that there will be no problems for a while even if I am not around. That said, it is also true that nobody can fill the void that I will leave\u2026 If it is fine, then I shall stay for the time being.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you willing to do so? Then, I will contact you again tomorrow, after the discussions are complete.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, there are two more things I want to ask you. First, I would like to know the details of the Martial Lord. The second matter concerns Death Knights\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2666 \u2666 \u2666</p><br/><p>As the appointed time drew near, Ainz cast a detection spell. Normally, he would have stacked numerous defensive spells on himself first, but it would be too wasteful to expend a lot of valuable scrolls. Unlike how things were at the graveyard, when he was sure there were hostiles present, Ainz simply cast the spell.</p><br/><p>That said, he picked a place where any counterattacks would not strike others.</p><br/><p>A different scene appeared in his field of vision. This was the interior of a coach. Ainz manipulated the floating point of view and observed the exterior of the coach.</p><br/><p>Then, Ainz cast [Greater Teleportation].</p><br/><p>The teleport took place without incident, and Ainz opened the door to the coach. Ainzach, who was seated within, had a look of shock on his face. However, Ainz nonchalantly boarded, closed the door, and dispelled the invisibility spell he had cast on himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs I thought, it was Your Majesty. Although I understand the need for secrecy, could you please not use an invisibility spell next time?</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I do not use invisibility, I will be spotted, no?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt should be fine because of Your Majesty\u2019s mask, am I wrong?</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed, that might be the case, but I used a teleportation spell. I would like to avoid being drawn into troublesome matters.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, since you understand, shall we leave?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll right. Let us depart.\u201d</p><br/><p>The coach passed through the opened gate, and reached the place designated by the doorman. This was a parking area which could accommodate several coaches.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, let us proceed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz dismounted from the coach after Ainzach.</p><br/><p>An old man in a butler\u2019s uniform awaited them there. He was accompanied by a maid.</p><br/><p>Though he looked like a butler, he did not feel as powerful as Sebas. He seemed like a very ordinary, albeit well-bred old man. The butler was human, though the same was not true for the maid.</p><br/><p>A pair of ears adorned the top of the maid\u2019s head; not human ears, but ears from some kind of animal. Although it was hard to be sure since they were obscured by her hair, there was no swelling at the site where normal humans had their ears. She had a cute face, but it was not the same way a human being was cute \u2015 more like an animal sort of cute.</p><br/><p>\u201cWelcome, Ainzach-sama and \u2015 Your Majesty the Sorcerer King, I believe. The master awaits you. Please allow us to lead the way. May I ask you to follow behind us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWha?!\u201d</p><br/><p>After he heard the butler\u2019s speech, a strangled cry of surprise escaped Ainzach\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>Ainzach had said in yesterday\u2019s talk that he would not bring up Ainz\u2019s true identity, so he must have been shocked because they had managed to guess who Ainz was. For Ainz, however, this was nothing to be alarmed about. His mask might have concealed his face, but he had not changed his clothes. Anyone with a good information network would have heard about him. Under these circumstances, not replying would be rude.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you. Then, please show us the way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The butler lowered his head. A beat later, so did the maid.</p><br/><p>After the two of them started walking, Ainzach quietly told Ainz:</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you very much, Your Majesty.\u201d</p><br/><p>His thanks was because Ainz had responded to the butler.</p><br/><p><i>No need for that,</i> Ainz wanted to say, but in the end he accepted the thanks in silence.</p><br/><p>To Suzuki Satoru, a superior ought to cover for his subordinates if the latter made a mistake. Ainzach\u2019s thanks was a natural reaction. It was an unavoidable step in his future growth as one of Ainz\u2019s subordinates.</p><br/><p>Once more, Ainz keenly realized that being a boss was not relaxing at all.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Ainz realized that he had never once said \u201cThanks\u201d while he was playing the role of a ruler.</p><br/><p><i>I need to find a time to thank the Guardians and all the NPCs. I need to show my appreciation for their hard work.</i></p><br/><p>Ainz\u2019s objective was to run the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick like a benevolent company. As he idly pondered the matter, he did not stop moving, but continued walking toward the direction where he was being led.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough, it was quite surprising to actually encounter a Rabbit Man, Your Majesty.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Wouldn\u2019t it be better to discuss this sort of thing after the person in question was gone? </i>Ainz thought that, but the topic interested him, so he decided to go with the flow.</p><br/><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t it be Rabbit Woman?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026 well\u2026 their species name is Rabbit Man.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAinzach, it was merely a joke. Taking it so seriously is somewhat troubling.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I wonder if she came from further east than the City-State Alliance. How exotic.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz had no idea how far away \u201ceast of the City-State Alliance\u201d was. His information did not yet cover such distant regions.</p><br/><p>Still, he had not seen any in the Kingdom, and she was the only Rabbit Man he had encountered in the Imperial Capital. It must be hard to live in a place without other members of one\u2019s kind, even without considering discrimination from other races.</p><br/><p>Ainz was curious and wanted to ask her some questions, but he could not do so. It would be troublesome if he stepped on a landmine during their conversation.</p><br/><p>Before long, they reached a house.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe master awaits you within. Please.\u201d</p><br/><p>The interior of the house was decorated with many articles of lovingly-oiled and maintained weapons and armor. They were clean, free of dust and displayed in neat rows.</p><br/><p>Upon closer inspection, many of the weapons were scuffed and dented on their business ends. It was clear that these weapons had been used in actual combat.</p><br/><p>Rather than a weapon merchant\u2019s shop display, it seemed more like the gallery owner displaying the weapons of his glorious past.</p><br/><p>After a hasty glance around, Ainz\u2019s gaze returned to the sword he saw first.</p><br/><p>It was the most beautiful of all the weapons in the room.</p><br/><p>There was no sign of damage on the sword. The gallery\u2019s owner must have been quite fond of it, judging by how it had been placed to be the first thing anyone would see when they entered the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes it please you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, truly an excellent collection.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thus did Ainz answer the room\u2019s owner seated on the sofa \u2015 in other words, the owner of this gallery. The owner was stout-bodied and his hair was cut so short that one could see his scalp.</p><br/><p>They did not bother with greetings, but continued talking about weapons.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, which piece do you favor most \u2015 ah, that one. Everyone who comes into this room says that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz entered the room and stood before the sword.</p><br/><p>\u201cMay I pick it up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, by all means.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz thanked him and picked up the sword. Of course, it would drop if he actually tried to wield it in earnest, but holding it was fine.</p><br/><p>He peered at the sword, and then he noticed the characters carved on the blade. These bizarre characters were vaguely familiar to Ainz. He searched his memories, and finally found the answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cRunes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOhhh! As expected of Your Majesty. You know of these letters!\u201d</p><br/><p><i>What? Seriously? \u2026Are runes commonly used in this world?</i></p><br/><p>Runes were an alphabet which had apparently been used in the past of Suzuki Satoru\u2019s world. The fact that such characters existed in this world meant that it was very likely someone from the same world as Suzuki Satoru had spread them here. Thus, Ainz carefully answered:</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Probably, I believe. I only know of them. I cannot create rune-engraved items. May I know which smith made this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOhhh, that was a good question. That sword was forged by a runesmith of the Dwarven Kingdom in the Azellisian Mountain Range. It is about 150 years old. The blade can accumulate electricity, and there\u2019s a maker\u2019s mark on the hilt. Did you see it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The gallery owner was standing next to Ainz.</p><br/><p>The overwhelming smell of cologne assaulted his nose.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a piece by Stonenel, a famous artisan.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>A Dwarven artisan? \u2026Looks like I\u2019ll have to learn more about that.</i></p><br/><p>\u201cHoh. That does sound like a famous artisan. Are there any more examples of his work here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz looked around, and the man laughed heartily.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha. No, not in here. I store them elsewhere. However, this is the only piece which bears such a powerful enchantment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHoh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz concealed his disappointment as he quietly emoted.</p><br/><p>That said, he had still learned something about the artisan called Stonenel. He had to see if there was a player there.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard that the weapons made by dwarven runesmiths rarely circulate on the market. And you actually have more of them in store?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz gave Ainzach a mental thumbs-up for asking that question.</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed I do, Ainzach,\u201d the man smiled. \u201cI snatch them up whenever they\u2019re on auction. Recently, there was a really persistent adventurer trying to outbid me. I ended up paying three times what I had originally planned.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainzach shook his head incredulously (sort of), while Ainz nodded in approval. This was how things were for a collector. An outsider would never be able to understand. At times, even Ainz did not understand the actions of his past self.</p><br/><p>Ainz wanted to keep asking, but in the end he decided to return the sword to its original place.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems I was entranced by your marvellous collection without even greeting you. Do forgive my lack of respect.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man was all smiles.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty has a way with words. Then, allow me to reintroduce myself. I am Osk, an insignificant merchant.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou will surely anger the other merchants of the Empire if you call yourself insignificant. I remain the Sorcerer King, Ainz Ooal Gown.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot a day goes by when I do not hear of your mighty name. Please, have a seat. I will have the servants prepare drinks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026While this is a rare opportunity\u2026 there is no need to prepare my share.\u201d</p><br/><p>Osk\u2019s eyes did not seem quite proportional to his head. He studied Ainz with those eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, I have heard the rumors\u2026 but could I trouble you to remove that mask?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Since this is a request of the home\u2019s owner, I must comply.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz took off his mask, revealing his bare face.</p><br/><p>There was no look of surprise on Osk\u2019s face. His eyes were very small, so once he narrowed his eyes to smile, there was no way to look into their depths.</p><br/><p>\u201cOhhh\u2026 I see, I see\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Osk nodded several times before speaking again.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn truth, I was worried that I would not be able to prepare tea that would be able to satisfy the tastes of the renowned Sorcerer King, but it would seem that was wasted effort on my part.\u201d</p><br/><p>After those cheerful words, Osk\u2019s belly wobbled with laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cSay, Osk. Why did you think His Majesty would come with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhh, it\u2019s not hard to tell, right? E-Rantel is under the control of His Majesty. When I heard that the Guildmaster of E-Rantel\u2019s Adventurer\u2019s Guild was visiting, in the company of someone more important than himself, only one person came to mind. Granted, it could have been some other confidant of the Sorcerer King, but my instincts told me otherwise,\u201d Osk said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, is it my turn to ask questions now? Did you once use the weapons displayed here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Osk chuckled at Ainz\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could that be? Your Majesty, do consider my body! I can wield an abacus, but I have never once swung a sword. That is just a hobby of mine\u2026 Since I was a child, I have always admired the strong, as well as swords and other weapons.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems you understand. Now then, I have a question of my own. I have heard of Your Majesty\u2019s unstoppable might; was that due to the long time you have lived \u2015 well, I suppose it does count as living?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is correct, in comparison to the lifespans of you humans.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Ainz said this, he thought of something. What kind of being was the Sorcerer King Ainz Ooal Gown?</p><br/><p>Obviously he could not say, \u201cCertainly not, you two are older than me.\u201d Even if he did say so, they would not believe him. So he had to speak while in-character as the Sorcerer King. However, if he did not lock down the exact details of the Sorcerer King\u2019s character, things might turn out badly.</p><br/><p><i>In any case, it\u2019s confirmed that the undead live a long time. If anyone asks why I do not know certain things despite my long life, I can reply that I was focused on researching magic. Let\u2019s use that as a basic detail for the Sorcerer King\u2019s character.</i></p><br/><p>\u201cThat being the case, do you possess weapons of the past?\u201d</p><br/><p>Judging by that question, Osk did not intend to hide his curiosity.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I do. However, I cannot just give them to you, no?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor a suitable amount \u2015 no, I will try to pay three times the market value.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz could not reject him on the spot. This was because he recalled the precarious state of his personal finances. However, it would hardly be dignified for the ruler of a country to go \u201cSure, let\u2019s do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Money does not exactly appeal to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI sincerely apologize. Saying so to Your Majesty \u2015 who is the ruler of a country \u2015 was terribly rude of me\u2026 Then, what can I offer to make you want to trade them to me?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>So he wants to phrase it as receiving a bounty for meritorious service to my country, or something like that? Hm? Well, in that case\u2026</i></p><br/><p>Ainz took out a shortsword. It was wreathed in a billowing mist effect. Its faintly translucent blue blade was made of blue crystal metal, and it contained little mana. That said, its overall ability classified it as a high-class item in YGGDRASIL, and it was certainly more powerful than the average magic item in this world.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis, this is!\u201d</p><br/><p>Two voices cried out those words.</p><br/><p>Ainzach\u2019s eyes went wide as he stared at the shortsword. \u201cUmu,\u201d Ainz muttered, before placing it in front of Ainzach.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHah?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Once more, those words were spoken by two voices.</p><br/><p>\u201cAinzach, this is a gift for your hard work. That said, this is not an award, nor is this meant to symbolize your station, I simply felt that this sort of thing is similar to the reward I wish to hand out in my ideal nation, so I give this to you. If you require cash instead, it is fine to sell it off.\u201d</p><br/><p>This shortsword did not contain enough data to harm Ainz. Nor was it one of the weapons made by his former guildmates and thus filled with memories.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, how could I dare accept such\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainzach\u2019s body shuddered uncontrollably.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is nothing amazing. Well, if you do not want it, I can change it for something else when the time comes. A healing potion, perhaps. That should be fine. What do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainzach hesitated for a while, but in the end he decided to keep the shortsword.</p><br/><p>\u201cI shall accept it. Thank you very much, Your Majesty! I will continue serving Your Majesty with all my strength, with effort that will not be outshone by this sword!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulations, Ainzach. If you run into any trouble, remember to think of this friend of yours.\u201d</p><br/><p>Osk eyed the shortsword as he said this. Ainzach had a look on his face like a mother bear protecting her cubs.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t happen. Never.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz decided to change his tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then. Let us move on to the real business.\u201d</p><br/><p>Osk reluctantly pulled his eyes away from the handkerchief that Ainzach had used to wrap the sword, and replied:</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Understood. May I ask why you have graced my humble estate with your presence?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUmu\u2026 I am not given to dressing up my words. Let me get to the point\u2026. I would like you to arrange a bout with the Martial Lord of the arena.\u201d</p><br/><p>Osk\u2019s eyes widened, but soon they returned to their normal shape.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have heard that the Martial Lord is not part of the arena personnel, but a gladiator you have raised since he was a child. Ainzach told me that you can quickly put a fight on the cards if you agree to have the Martial Lord fight, which is why I came to make this request of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFuhahahaha. Are you serious, Your Majesty? You do know that the Martial Lord is the mightiest man in the arena, with a monster\u2019s body and outstanding fighting skills? He might be the strongest one in history. Perhaps Your Majesty counts strong individuals among his followers as well, but defeating him is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Osk shook his head with pride.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Is he stronger than Fluder?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, this is from the perspective of a warrior. It\u2019s not applicable to a magic caster. All they have to do is fly up and attack repeatedly with magic and that\u2019s the end of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Osk\u2019s quiet grumbling somewhat perturbed Ainz, and then Ainzach chimed in:</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce, an adventurer team took to the sky and won by raining spells and arrows on him from a distance. That was a pretty disappointing fight. Ever since, the arena has forbidden teleportation and flight magic.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Osk looked at Ainz. He seemed to have recovered.</p><br/><p>\u201cCough! Well, that was rude of me, Your Majesty. I recalled some bitter memories\u2026 Then, back to the topic, Your Majesty. May I ask who intends to fight the Martial Lord? Are they human?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz and Ainzach looked at each other. Then, Ainz answered:</p><br/><p>\u201cThat would be me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Eh?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI, Ainz Ooal Gown, shall be his opponent.\u201d</p><br/><p>After a brief period of silence, Osk asked in a panic:</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, but but, but are you not the ruler of a country, Your Majesty?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed I am. What of it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? No, that\u2019s correct, but\u2026 that\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh, I understand what worries you. You must be thinking, what would happen if I came to be hurt?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt would be fine if it ended in just getting hurt,\u201d Osk muttered under his breath. Ainz pretended not to notice.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe at ease. There will not be a problem, no matter what happens to me. I will leave written proof of that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut if that sort of thing does happen, I won\u2019t be able to do business any more. I have heard that the Empire is supposed to be an ally of the Sorcerous Kingdom. If I allow the king of an allied country to be seriously injured, the state will have its eye on me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI promise you \u2015 you will not be inconvenienced by this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you say so\u2026\u201d Osk paused to think, and then asked again: \u201cThese words might be unpleasant to the ear, but could you offer up something as a guarantee?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA guarantee? Like what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Please give me something like what you gave Ainzach earlier. If anything happens, it\u2019ll be fine as long as I can keep that item.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that is what it takes to satisfy you, then I shall make that promise. However, I cannot give it to you right away. I promise it will reach you by tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you very much, Your Majesty. \u2026There is also another matter I would like to ask, though I fear it is inappropriate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz waved, indicating that Osk should continue.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs a promoter, I collect a lot of information. Much of that information pertains to powerful beings which might appear in the arena, or monsters. There are also rumors concerning Your Majesty \u2015 dare I ask if it is true that Your Majesty slew tens of thousands of the Kingdom\u2019s people with a single spell?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKoff!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainzach coughed in a very contrived way. He was glaring at Osk with reproachful eyes, but this was nothing that had to be hidden, nor was it something to be ashamed of.</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed, that is true. I slew them with my magic. Will you reproach me for it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I was simply asking to gauge the extent of Your Majesty\u2019s mystical powers. After all, if you did use that spell from the rumors, it would be\u2026 very bad. After all, the arena is within the Imperial Capital.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no, I will not cast a spell like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even Ainz had no intention of using such a spell in the middle of an allied country. What kind of terrorist would do that sort of thing?</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, I feel the same way as well. Unlike the common image of the undead, Your Majesty is a noble and rational man. I do not believe you will enact a great slaughter because you hate the living. That said, making assumptions and neglecting to confirm these things might lead to failure.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz agreed on that point as well. This was one of the dangers that came with allowing a new person to join. In truth, Suzuki Satoru had failed like this in the past.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour concerns are valid. Allow me to repeat myself \u2015 I will not use that spell.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is that? Is it because it has something to do with the alignment of the stars?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhile that is not related to the mat-\u201d</p><br/><p>A lightbulb went off over Ainz\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, that spell is one of my most powerful trump cards. Because El-Nix-dono desired it, I went out of my way to cast that grand spell, which I can only use once every ten years. Thus, for the next decade, I must conserve my strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHoh!\u201d A strange gleam lit up Osk\u2019s eyes. \u201cIs it really alright to tell me that? After all, this might be considered to be a weakness of Your Majesty\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is fine. I may not be able to use a destructive spell like that, but slaughtering any fools who oppose me is still easy. After all, it does not mean I cannot use other spells.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected of Your Majesty. In other words, the Martial Lord will also be an easy opponent; is that what you are implying?\u201d</p><br/><p>After Ainz nodded with confidence, a smile lit up Osk\u2019s face. However, when Ainz studied him, he could not be sure if the smile was genuine.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. Finally, please allow me one more question. Why do you want to fight the Martial Lord, Your Majesty?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause I have heard that he is a powerful foe\u2026 I wish to know who is stronger, between him and Gazef Stronoff. There was Gazef in the Kingdom, so perhaps the greatest reason is because I want to know who is his equivalent in the Empire.\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, that was not why Ainz was fighting. However, it was the reason he and Ainzach had agreed upon after discussing the matter.</p><br/><p>It would have been fine to state the real reason, but Osk was not a trustworthy person. In truth, he seemed like the sort who prioritised his own gains. Ainz felt that being honest with him would not end well.</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand. Thank you very much\u2026 Then, I shall schedule the fight with the Martial Lord. However\u2015\u201d</p><br/><p>Osk raised his hand to interrupt Ainz\u2019s thanks.</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope you will abide by the rules of the arena. In addition, while Your Majesty might be taking the match with the Martial Lord seriously, it is still a performance of sorts for us. Thus, an overly one-sided fight would be terribly boring. With that in mind, I would like to request that Your Majesty not use magic, and that you will use a sword \u2015 a weapon \u2015 to battle the Martial Lord. I submit that these conditions should make for a good fight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you saying?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainzach sprang up from his seat. His face was red from anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that even possible?! His Majesty is a magic caster! How do you expect him to win?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHoho. Indeed, that is the case. There would be no way for His Majesty the Sorcerer King to win once his magic was sealed. My my, to think I actually brought up such a sensible matter. Still, I did not expect to hear these words from your mouth. I would have expected you to be alright with His Majesty losing. It seems my opinion of you has changed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2015!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAinzach, don\u2019t get too worked up. It is fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Your Majesty, what did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz chuckled, because Osk and Ainzach were looking at him in an amusing way. However, it would be bad if that laugh was interpreted as sneering, so Ainz tried to mask it with a snort.</p><br/><p>However, that was impossible for someone who had only a hole for a nose.</p><br/><p>Ainz decided not to waste his energy and decided to try and bluff his way through with words.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou seem to have misheard me. I said, it is fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no change in Osk\u2019s expression, but his mind was working at high speeds. That much was obvious.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Then, will you swear it on the name of the Sorcerer King, Your Majesty?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSwear on my name? \u2026I understand. I, Ainz Ooal Gown, swear by my own name that I shall not use any form of magic during the battle with the Martial Lord.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait! Your Majesty! How can you make such an oath without even seeing the Martial Lord\u2019s strength?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainzach\u2019s words were very sensible. However, if his information on the Martial Lord was correct, there should be no problems in doing so.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019ll work out somehow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you really think it\u2019ll work itself out?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz was vaguely moved by Ainzach\u2019s retort. Nobody had stated their opinions like this ever since he had begun his reign as the ruler of Nazarick. That had come up a little during his time as Momon, but even that had faded away after he had risen through the ranks.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou too! If the king of another country dies in the Empire\u2019s arena, there\u2019ll be hell to pay!\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Of course,</i> Ainz thought as he locked eyes with Osk.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s only to be expected. What will you do, Your Majesty? It is not too late to accept the advice of your loyal subject and give up now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz shrugged in response. He could understand Ainzach\u2019s worries. After all, this plan had originally been his idea. Granted, he had been operating under the assumption that he could use magic when he came up with that plan. However, did he really think that Ainz without magic was that weak?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt will be fine. More importantly, shouting like that is quite shameful, Ainzach. Then, Osk. I\u2019m not too clear on this, but what good does my death do you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Osk\u2019s eyes went wide in surprise. A reaction like that was not the slightest bit cute on a middle-aged man like him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems Your Majesty is mistaken. I would gain nothing from it. As the Guildmaster says, it would be a far greater hindrance for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>There did not seem to be any ulterior motives behind proposing these disadvantageous conditions for Ainz. In all likelihood, it had been born from his thoughts as a promoter.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2015Is that so. Then, we will proceed as planned..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Your Majesty, do you have a way to defeat the Martial Lord \u2015 who is stronger than Gazef Stronoff \u2015 without magic?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Stronoff, huh. Truly a man of enviable strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz noticed the look of surprise on Ainzach\u2019s face, but Ainz did not say a word as he recalled the former Warrior-Captain.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf the Martial Lord is stronger than that man, then obviously, I\u2019ll have to be on my guard. However, the strength I speak of refers to his spirit and not his fighting ability. Now, if we were comparing the strength of the Martial Lord\u2019s and Stronoff\u2019s sword arms, surely the former would slay the latter in a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. Speaking of which, I must continue answering the question which you asked earlier, Your Majesty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Osk raised both his hands. His arms were muscular and bereft of flab.</p><br/><p>\u201cI love the clash of sword against sword and fist against fist. Regretfully, I have no talent for fighting skills, and all my efforts could win me victory. That was why I thought of making a warrior who could substitute for me, and have him attain victory in my place.\u201d</p><br/><p>Osk sneered. This was not the merchant\u2019s attitude he had been showing until now, but his face as a human being.</p><br/><p>This was the first time Ainz had encountered such a strange person, although he knew that fetishes varied from person to person. In other words, Osk had a particularly abnormal fetish. Ainz made a mental compartment called \u201cPerverts\u201d and filed Osk into it.</p><br/><p>\u201cTherefore, it would feel very good should Your Majesty lose to the Martial Lord I have trained.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so.\u201d</p><br/><p>Osk and Ainzach looked at Ainz, surprise written all over their faces.</p><br/><p>Ainz wanted to ask, <i>what have you been doing since just now?</i></p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me that dumb look. If you have something to say, say it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no, that\u2019s all I have to say.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have no idea what sort of reaction you want from me, Osk\u2026 Humans are truly complicated creatures. Well? If that\u2019s all, does that mean you expect me to fill the gap? \u2026Hm, how about this. Are you really that happy to beat me while I cannot use my magic?\u201d</p><br/><p>For some reason, Osk stumbled over his answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, ah, that\u2026 It\u2019s just that I don\u2019t really like magic that much\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. Then, let\u2019s leave the matter at that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Osk and Ainzach looked at each other. <i>Come on, spit it out,</i> Ainz thought. Still, this was how the working world went. If someone who has no permission to speak bared his heart, he would get into trouble.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have made our true intentions known to each other, so let us not waste time with petty deceptions and get on with things. How will you arrange the schedule for the fight with the Martial Lord? If possible, I\u2019d like to make a big event of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, I\u2019ll officially announce a challenger to the Martial Lord after today\u2019s events. I\u2019d better get on it. However, I intend to keep the fact that the challenger is Your Majesty a secret until the match starts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI do not understand your reasons for that. Would that not be a waste, from a promoter\u2019s point of view?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLogic dictates that the king of an allied country showing up at an arena match is\u2026 oya? Come to think of it, I haven\u2019t heard of a welcoming ceremony. Is it scheduled for later?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz could not help but look away.</p><br/><p>This was bad.</p><br/><p>Ainz gave thanks that he did not have a heart, and then forcefully shook his empty, undead skull. Then, he shrugged helplessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI came to the Empire in a personal capacity. El-Nix-dono does not know that I am here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Osk\u2019s expression vanished. He must have scented something suspicious. As a merchant, it made sense that he would be very sensitive to potential profit. In other words, if there were no gains to be made, there would be no point in participating.</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Eh?</i></p><br/><p>\u201cPublicly announcing Your Majesty\u2019s challenge would surely draw comments from all sides. Naturally, the identity of the challenger must be kept secret. Then, can I assume you will handle all the issues which will result from this, Your Majesty?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. Leave that part of things to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand. Then, can I take up a bit more of your time? I would like to finalize the schedule for the day of the match.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2666 \u2666 \u2666</p><br/><p>\u201cHas he gone back?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>The butler had returned from sending off the Sorcerer King, and that was his answer to Osk\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally now,\u201d Osk replied, and then he looked to the maid standing behind the butler.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2015Headhunter Rabbit.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>What,</i> the man before him thought as he tilted his dainty little head.</p><br/><p>Yes, \u201chis.\u201d He was a man, dressed in an outfit that best fit a maid.</p><br/><p>According to him, he did so because dressing like a woman made others underestimate him and become careless, and also because people would not attack his groin.</p><br/><p>It would seem that it was for those two reasons, and not because of personal preference. However, given that he displayed adorable motions like those from just now even in everyday life, he probably enjoyed this sort of thing to some extent.</p><br/><p>The fact that his thoughts had actually wandered that far was a sign that he was thinking too much about this.</p><br/><p>It did not inconvenience Osk in any particular way, so he did not mind.</p><br/><p>Then, there was the matter of his alias, \u201cHeadhunter Rabbit\u201d.</p><br/><p>It did not suit a cute-looking man, but then again, he was a mercenary who hailed from a nation to the east of the City-State Alliance, famous as a warrior-cum-assassin.</p><br/><p>Osk had signed a contract with him and hired him for a staggering amount. He had contracted worker teams and gladiators as bodyguards too, but nobody else was paid as highly as him.</p><br/><p>His strength matched his price tag \u2015 above an orichalcum-ranked adventurer, at the very least. The fact was that he had not been embroiled in any troublesome matters ever since he had employed him.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me what you think of His Majesty, the Sorcerer King.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had another ability, besides being a first-rate fighter-cum-assassin.</p><br/><p>That was the ability to analyze his opponents. Through long experience in the murderous profession of being a warrior and assassin, he had attained the ability to evaluate people \u2015 to see if they were strong.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s extremely bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>To date, there was only one other person about whom he had stated a similar opinion. That person was the Martial Lord himself. In other words, this was the second person he could not defeat.</p><br/><p>Incidentally, the rank below that was \u201cIt\u2019s bad\u201d, which he had said when he had seen the Empire\u2019s Four Knights.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs His Majesty a strong warrior as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. Judging by his footsteps alone, he\u2019s not that strong. He doesn\u2019t walk like someone who\u2019s been trained as a warrior or assassin. Rather, the uncle beside him feels more like a warrior. Still \u2015 it\u2019s bad. Just standing behind him made me want to run away.\u201d</p><br/><p>After he said that, he extended his arms.</p><br/><p>Osk\u2019s eyes were entranced by his fists.</p><br/><p>They were round fists.</p><br/><p>His fists had been reshaped by punching hard objects tens, perhaps hundreds of thousands of times, until they were now in a round, ball-like shape.</p><br/><p>These hands were made for battle.</p><br/><p>A chill ran through Osk, followed by an uncontrollable excitement.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2015Where are you looking, you pervert.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was just thinking that those were good hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was true he liked those hands very much, but sadly, Headhunting Rabbit did not interest him.</p><br/><p>Gender was not a big matter for him. However, Osk\u2019s ideal partner was the warrior from the Kingdom\u2019s Blue Rose (Gagaran). Granted, Headhunting Rabbit would make a good partner as well, but he felt too skinny, compared to her. In contrast, the Martial Lord was a little too thick.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026So you don\u2019t want me to renew my contract with you next year?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat would be very troubling! Hardly anyone can match up to you\u2026 Well, the heiress of Ijaniya aside. Oops, it seems we\u2019ve gotten off-topic. Then\u2015\u201d</p><br/><p>Osk\u2019s eyes left those round fists, and travelled up. Goosebumps broke out on Headhunting Rabbit\u2019s skin.</p><br/><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been able to calm down yet. It feels really bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo he\u2019s nothing much as a warrior, but he\u2019s an extremely bad opponent\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just like another Martial Lord.\u201d</p><br/><p>Osk picked up on what Headhunting Rabbit was trying to say. He was referring to that Martial Lord.</p><br/><p>There were powerful and weak races in this world.</p><br/><p>Humans typified the weak races, being little more than meatbags without darkvision, with no hard carapaces to protect their bodies, or other special abilities.</p><br/><p>In contrast, there were the mighty races, like Dragons, for instance. They were protected by hard scales, they were graceful and mighty, they were equipped with claws and teeth which could easily rend steel, they possessed fiery or icy breath and other special abilities, and they were furnished with wings that they could use to soar through the sky.</p><br/><p>They were a race that was strong, even without warrior training.</p><br/><p>What Headhunting Rabbit was trying to say was that the Sorcerer King belonged to such a race.</p><br/><p>The undead had poor physical stats. This was what Osk knew to be true. Yet, it did not seem to be the case for the Sorcerer King.</p><br/><p>\u201cOsk-sama, why did you accept this match? His Majesty knows about the Martial Lord, but we do not know about his abilities. I feel it will be a very unfavorable match.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Ara? You don\u2019t get it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Headhunting Rabbit replied in a tired voice, \u201cI don\u2019t think about these pointless things\u2015\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300d</p><br/><p>The butler looked to Osk in a surprised way. Thus, Osk answered:</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes the champion flee from challengers?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that all?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is all. However, that is also why it is so important. There\u2019s no need to just kill each other. But if this is an official challenge, complete with a letter sent up to request a match, it can\u2019t be avoided. The Martial Lord would think the same way as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat an idiot\u2015\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps. Still, that\u2019s men for you. However, I feel His Majesty is the type who reveals his true strength in battle, rather than during a competitive match. Now, consider a regulated bout, and a no-holds-barred deathmatch. Under which circumstances would you prefer to face the Sorcerer King?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNeither. I\u2019d turn tail and run.\u201d</p><br/><p>Osk laughed, because that was the wisest choice.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, next up. What do you think of the Sorcerer King?\u201d</p><br/><p>That line was not directed at his master, but at the butler waiting in the rear who did not change his expression.</p><br/><p>In the past, he might have expressed his displeasure silently, to indicate that was not the proper attitude a hired man should have toward his master. Still, that displeasure had vanished somewhere along the way. Perhaps it was when Headhunting Rabbit had slain a would-be assassin.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe has a very charming personality.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHo~n,\u201d Headhunting Rabbit mused in a strange way.</p><br/><p>Ainzach did not appear to be under duress. In other words, the Sorcerer King had something which allowed him to secure the cooperation of a city\u2019s residents within a few months of conquering it.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you see his regal bearing? Whether it was in bringing only Ainzach, or agreeing to not use magic in his battle, he radiated the pride of the mighty. In addition, he\u2019s a very intelligent man. It feels like he\u2019s very used to this sort of negotiations.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even he felt it was surprising.</p><br/><p>Osk was a merchant, but the Sorcerer King viewed him as an equal. Under normal circumstances, some nobles would want to establish who was on top, to say nothing of a king.</p><br/><p>This was what baffled him.</p><br/><p>He could understand it if he had been a trader in the past, but that was impossible. In other words, he was simply adept at negotiations.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn terms of overall ability, he is comparable to our Emperors.\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, he had not read that deeply into him. It was simply that the Sorcerer King frightened him that much.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I should say that he\u2019s equivalent to the Bloody Emperor, at the very least.\u201d</p><br/><p>So at a minimum, he was equal to the greatest Emperor in history. What a nightmare.</p><br/><p>Osk shook his head. He would be paralyzed by contemplation if this went on. Of course, he did not want to gaze into the abyss of the Sorcerer King. However, there was one thing he had to do right now.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I must inform the Martial Lord of this, and keep him in prime condition from now on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWill he agree?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is a warrior. He will not run from a challenge.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHo~n. Well, it\u2019d be good if he could win~\u201d</p><br/><p><b>Part 4</b></p><br/><p>On the day of the match with the Sorcerer King, Osk asked the usual question:</p><br/><p>\u201cHow are things?</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problems. I\u2019m in top form.\u201d</p><br/><p>A gigantic monster answered him.</p><br/><p>It was a member of the Troll species of monsters, but one major difference set it apart from them.</p><br/><p>That would be the air of a warrior that surrounded it, a mantle which none but those who had survived countless intense battles would be able to assume.</p><br/><p>However, that was only to be expected. He was a troll who had adapted to fighting and who had specialized in battle. He was an outstanding individual even amongst the diverse troll species, and he was known as a War Troll.</p><br/><p>He was the Martial Lord, the strongest gladiator in the arena.</p><br/><p>Osk looked tenderly at that body.</p><br/><p>It was true that there were many people who could beat the Martial Lord in terms of martial prowess (strength). Most silver-ranked frontliners in adventurer teams could do that. However, the reason why the Martial Lord could easily defeat such people was very simple.</p><br/><p>This was because the bodies of War Trolls were far superior to those of humans, be it in terms of strength or endurance, or in the huge attack radius their massive frames granted them.</p><br/><p>In addition, there were the racial abilities he possessed which humans did not.</p><br/><p>The first of them was his skin. Wearing a suit of armor over that thick hide of his was sufficient to cause the majority of attacks directed at him to simply bounce off. Granted, one could target the soft-looking and mobile joints but his regeneration presented a formidable barrier to anyone attempting to cripple him via that route.</p><br/><p>An attack that would certainly slay a normal human being would not kill a troll. Their astounding regenerative ability caused wounds to seal shut and it could only be stopped by fire or acid.</p><br/><p>With this immense biological power on his side, the current Martial Lord was truly the strongest in history.</p><br/><p>The warrior that Osk praised as the mightiest donned his armor before the man\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>He had hired adamantite-ranked adventurers to gather the components for that armor, and then had the masterwork result enhanced with magic. At that time, he had sunk about 20% of his assets into that particular project. The club he carried was made of a magical alloy as well, and it had been made in a similar manner.</p><br/><p>The Martial Lord put on his magic rings, amulets, and the other components of his panoply.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2015I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those words sounded far more intelligent now than how he had spoken in the past.</p><br/><p>Every time Osk saw his majestic frame, his chest grew hot. He was the one who had raised him into this state.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, Martial Lord, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>They walked together to the entrance of the arena. This was a ritual they had always performed.</p><br/><p>The Martial Lord remained silent after leaving his room.</p><br/><p>His silence was because he had once been excited and looked forward to fighting his foes. Somewhere along the way, it had turned to disappointment in his opponents\u2019 abilities. How would it be now?</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the Martial Lord stopped in his tracks.</p><br/><p>Osk did not recall anything happening like this before.</p><br/><p>He began to panic at this unprecedented occurrence, and looked up to ask what was going on. The Martial Lord slowly raised the visor of his armet helm, revealing his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It sounded as though he was squeezing out that voice.</p><br/><p>Osk blinked.</p><br/><p>This was only the fourth time he had heard those words of thanks. The previous three times had been when he was given his weapon, his armor, and then when he had fought his best opponent, the previous Martial Lord \u201cRot Wolf\u201d, Krelvo Palantynen.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, what\u2019s wrong, Martial Lord?\u201d</p><br/><p>His eyes stared at the corridor before him.</p><br/><p>\u201cFu, fu.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Martial Lord\u2019s body quivered as he chuckled.</p><br/><p>It was the excitement of a warrior.</p><br/><p>That was what Osk believed, but it did not seem to be the case.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of\u2026 What kind of challenger is this? No, am I the challenger?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWha-what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFu, fu\u2026 How scary. Osk, I\u2019m shaking in fear.\u201d</p><br/><p>Osk could not help but doubt his ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis, this must be what living beings call instinct. My legs won\u2019t move\u2026 It\u2019s as though they\u2019re telling me that if I go, I\u2019ll die, fu, fu.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was not laughter. He was simply trying to calm his disturbed breathing.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard my opponent was the Sorcerer King, and I wondered what sort of foe he would be\u2026 It would seem my arrogance up till now will be repaid in full.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you saying, Martial Lord? What do you mean, arrogance?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am strong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Osk wanted to reply that there was nothing wrong with the Martial Lord\u2019s statement, but the Martial Lord continued before he could say so.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, my strength is a lie. It comes from my racial abilities, and it is not actual strength. Still, there are very few people who can contend with me. In particular, ever since I learned to use warrior techniques, I have never tried to understand my challengers\u2019 abilities or equipment, in order to create an unfavorable situation for me. There is no other way to train myself. But in the end, I have found a foe which my instincts are screaming at me to run away from. Thank you very much. You have completely fulfilled the agreement we made when you met me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMartial Lord\u2026 Go Gin.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had met the Martial Lord about ten years ago.</p><br/><p>There had been a rumor on the streets about a monster on the outskirts of the Empire. That monster was very rational, and would not slay a foe who put down their weapons. Osk was interested, and hurriedly set forth from the Empire to meet that bizarre monster. This was because he heard that the greatest power in the Empire, Fluder Paradyne, was on his way to dispatch the monster.</p><br/><p>He had been afraid at first. That was only natural. After all, the humans who had encountered him had only survived by chance.</p><br/><p>However, the Martial Lord had taken one look at Osk and snorted in disinterest, preparing to leave.</p><br/><p>That was why he forgot his fear and asked: \u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d</p><br/><p>The answer he got was not quite as articulate as it was now, but it had been along the lines of \u201cI am training to become stronger.\u201d</p><br/><p>Osk felt the scales fall from his eyes.</p><br/><p>Osk had a dream. That dream was to make a strong fighter. It was a dream of raising the ultimate warrior, in order to substitute for his talentless self. However, at that point, he realised that he did not need to limit himself to human beings. No, since nonhuman species were higher-spec to begin with, would that not be the way to make a strong \u2015 the ultimate warrior?</p><br/><p>At that point, Osk was not thinking about bringing a monster back. He was scouting someone who might well be the ultimate warrior, the tyrant of the arena, the future Martial Lord.</p><br/><p>It had been almost ten years since that fateful encounter. And now, for the first time, he witnessed the Martial Lord shaking in fear.</p><br/><p>\u201cMartial Lord\u2015\u201d</p><br/><p>Several things popped up in Osk\u2019s mind. The first was, \u201cDo you want to forfeit this match?\u201d The risk of death existed within this bout, and Osk could not bear to lose him, the Martial Lord that he had raised until now.</p><br/><p>However, he could not bring himself to speak those words.</p><br/><p>To the strong, having someone show concern for them was like an insult. For all he knew, those words might shatter the friendship he had built between himself and the Martial Lord.</p><br/><p>There was only one thing he could say here.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2015Don\u2019t lose, Martial Lord.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph. What are you saying? I have no intention of losing. All my challengers felt the same way. Everyone stood before me in the hopes of achieving victory. Now, it is simply my turn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the way!\u201d</p><br/><p>Osk slapped the Martial Lord on the back.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Sorcerer King is a magic caster, but that would be too boring of a contest. So, I have ruled that both sides cannot use magic. You will not lose to a foe like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026His magic? The Sorcerer King agreed to fight me, even under those conditions?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed, and he did so with an attitude which did not even consider the possibility of his defeat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHoh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The Martial Lord clenched his fist. It was a fist that called to mind the image of a giant maul.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe strong are often proud. I shall teach him the foolishness of his ways.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit! However, do not get cocky. The Sorcerer King is the sort of man who can give away jaw-dropping weapons on a whim. In all likelihood, he possesses magic items of awesome power.\u201d</p><br/><p>Restricting the use of magic items would probably increase the Martial Lord\u2019s chances of victory. But that would be too much of a handicap.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine. I now possess the mindset of a challenger. I will not be overconfident. I will not lose because I did not use my full strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Martial Lord took a step forward with a muscular leg, and Osk scrambled to follow.</p><br/><p>\u201cSay, could you seriously consider what we talked about earlier?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Martial Lord suddenly stopped in his tracks, a look of disgust on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cEarlier\u2026 you mean that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, the matter of your wife.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy now\u2026 Huhaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Martial Lord laughed, and Osk furrowed his brows while he blushed. <i>If you understand, don\u2019t act like that!</i></p><br/><p>\u201cReally, can you not cheer me on some other way? How many times must I say this\u2026 I will return to my village if I want a wife. You want my partner to be a human, right? Thank you very much, but I\u2019ll pass on any humans or whatnot. I\u2019m not into perverted things like that, or rather, any human who would actually want to sleep with me would be absolutely disgusting. What kind of sick fetish would that be, anyway? Besides, you want my child, right? I can\u2019t make those with humans.\u201d</p><br/><p>While it should be possible for humanoids to breed with each other, having children with demihumans was the sort of thing that only existed in stories.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s true\u2026 That being the case, why not bring your wife back with you? If you need anything to return in triumph, let me know and I\u2019ll get it for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Let me get this out of the way first. We Trolls think of humans as food. My wife might end up calmly eating humans, for all I know.\u201d</p><br/><p>To Osk, it would be fine if she only ate unnecessary humans. However, he did not say that.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so. Then bring your child back before he knows the taste of manflesh. If we train him up more intensively, he\u2019ll surely be stronger than you are now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Martial Lord crinkled his face with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, that would be interesting. Alright, I will consider that seriously.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2666 \u2666 \u2666</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, can you really win this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz replied to Ainzach\u2019s question with the answer he had given countless times:</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>A person who would take on a hopeless battle was either a true man of courage or an utter fool. This was not a random encounter; the battle had been decided from the planning phases.</p><br/><p>Ainz reviewed what he had learned in his mind.</p><br/><p>If the Martial Lord was only on the level of the Giant of the East, he would surely be able to win. That said, if he had the same strength as a warrior as Gazef, then after adding up his racial and job class levels, he would be a very tricky foe.</p><br/><p>However\u2015</p><br/><p><i>Well, it was a pretty despicable fighting method to begin with. I even asked Fluder for help after that.</i></p><br/><p>Ainz had the ability to completely negate weak attacks. He did not think the Martial Lord would be able to breach that defense. Therefore, Ainz had disabled that particular ability.</p><br/><p>Victory was not assured for him.</p><br/><p>At that battlefield, Ainz had killed over 100,000 people with magic. In YGGDRASIL, the amount of experience points gained was reduced in accordance to the level difference between both parties, to a minimum of one point. In other words, he should have earned over 100,000 experience points. Coupled with the accumulated experience from before coming to this new world, he should have gotten enough to level up. However, Ainz did not feel that he had levelled up or seen any related phenomena.</p><br/><p>In other words, Ainz could not get any stronger, as he had expected.</p><br/><p>Still \u2015 he could not be content with that.</p><br/><p>If level 100 was the limit, then it could not be helped. However, he was then obliged to fully utilize the power of those 100 levels and refine his skills. If he believed he was the strongest and rested on his laurels, someone might someday surpass him.</p><br/><p>Ainz knew that he had a certain amount of strength from being a mage. The skills and abilities he had honed in YGGDRASIL were also effective here. However, he had not practiced his abilities as a vanguard in YGGDRASIL.</p><br/><p><i>I learned a lot from the battle with that woman.</i></p><br/><p>He felt nothing but gratitude for that woman, who had taught him how lacking he was as a frontline fighter.</p><br/><p>That battle had sparked the desire in Ainz to improve his close combat ability. Right now, Ainz was confident that in stats, skills and even tactics, he was the equivalent of a level 33 warrior.</p><br/><p>This battle with the Martial Lord would be the proof of that. Ainz eagerly looked forward to it.</p><br/><p>Ainz looked at his neck.</p><br/><p>He did not have the luxury of wearing that any more. During the encounter with the Workers, he did not feel that he had earned much experience or learned any techniques. Honestly speaking, it felt like a waste of effort.</p><br/><p>As he thought about that, Ainz recalled a more pressing problem.</p><br/><p><i>Ah~ Jircniv is watching this fight too, right? Why is he here? He wasn\u2019t around when I came to check just now. It looks like the illegal border crossing is going to be exposed\u2026 Well, I guess I can just apologise for it. If he makes a big deal of it, I\u2019ll just ask him if he got the Kingdom\u2019s permission when he came to Nazarick and be done with it\u2026 I should probably go up and say hello to him. I guess not greeting him will ruin my image in his eyes.</i></p><br/><p>\u201cYour, Your Majesty, it\u2019s about time to enter,\u201d the man from the arena said as he entered the room to notify Ainz.</p><br/><p>They had met several times, but he froze up every time he saw Ainz\u2019s true face.</p><br/><p><i>Should I fight while masked?</i> He considered that, but he had gained permission to make a speech after beating the Martial Lord. For all he knew, there might be people in the audience who wanted to become adventurers in the Sorcerous Kingdom. With that in mind, it would be better not to engage in any deceptions.</p><br/><p>All he could do was to trust his own choices.</p><br/><p>Ainz slowly stepped forward.</p><br/><p>Normally speaking, the higher-ranked person ought to enter later. However, Ainz was the challenger in this arena, and was thus the lower-ranking one. Thus, he was obliged to enter first. Of course, Ainz saw it as natural and did not question it.</p><br/><p>Ainz smiled to the very worried-looking Ainzach.</p><br/><p>It seemed strange that he was more worried than the one who was about to go into battle himself.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2015Don\u2019t make me repeat myself, Ainzach. I will not lose.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2666 \u2666 \u2666</p><br/><p>After greeting Jircniv, Ainz returned to the arena.</p><br/><p>He had promised not to use magic during the fight, but the fight had not started yet. Surely his opponent would not quibble over something like that.</p><br/><p><i>He didn\u2019t seem too angry despite the fact that I crossed the border illegally. Is he going to complain afterwards? Or did he think I entered normally? If that was the case, they might end up hosting some sort of welcome for me, or maybe I\u2019m being too self-conscious\u2026 Will he be mad because I directly addressed him as Jircniv?</i></p><br/><p>Ainz mocked his thoughts, and then turned his eyes toward the entrance which faced him.</p><br/><p>The Martial Lord had not showed up yet.</p><br/><p><i>Then\u2026</i></p><br/><p>Ainz looked around at the audience in the arena.</p><br/><p>A shocked silence ruled the scene. Even the slightest movement was clearly audible.</p><br/><p><i>Well, it can\u2019t be helped\u2026 No, you people over there, this is not a mask.</i></p><br/><p>Ainz felt his smooth and shiny face. Now he understood. Anyone who could look at this face nonchalantly must be quite brave.</p><br/><p><i>Because of this, my popularity will increase once I get the audience fired up.</i></p><br/><p>While his objective was not to boost his popularity, it was better to have it than not. Plus, if it ended up raising the general opinion of all undead, it would probably improve their opinion of the Sorcerous Kingdom, which controlled many undead.</p><br/><p>Ainz gripped the staff in his hand.</p><br/><p>As a pure magic caster, Ainz\u2019s selection in weapons was very limited, largely to staves, daggers and the like. This time round, he had selected a staff used for physical attacks. It was a weapon he had made as a prototype in YGGDRASIL, but which had ended up unused. Since it was something he had used a long time ago, it was not very strong. Ainz as he was now could probably make a better weapon.</p><br/><p>That said, Ainz had not made such preparations.</p><br/><p>After considering the difference in strength between himself and the Martial Lord, Ainz had decided to fight him with his present weapon, to see how it \u2015 and the fight \u2015 turned out.</p><br/><p>This was the ultimate in foolishness to the YGGDRASIL player Suzuki Satoru, an unforgivable lapse of carelessness. If his friends were nearby, they might rebuke him with a \u201cThat won\u2019t do~\u201d</p><br/><p>However, he had already learned about all of the Martial Lord\u2019s magic items from Fluder. Thus, he had to subject himself to these unfavorable circumstances in order to use this as training.</p><br/><p>He did not want to show them a one-sided slaughter. Ainz\u2019s objective was an overwhelming victory of just the right amount.</p><br/><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen! From the north entrance! The! Martial! Lord!\u201d</p><br/><p>Unlike how they had treated him earlier, the entire arena erupted in cheering. Ainz could hear Jircniv\u2019s voice from the VIP room where he had shown his face earlier. The man was screaming as though to break his throat.</p><br/><p><i>\u2026He sounds pretty excited. Does Jircniv really like the Martial Lord that much? The king of the ring seems to be an idol of sorts, so this should be a normal reaction, right? It was the same in YGGDRASIL \u2015 the strong fighters in PVP matches were very popular with the spectators.</i></p><br/><p>As he reminisced about his YGGDRASIL days, Ainz began to pity Jircniv a little.</p><br/><p><i>He\u2019ll be shocked when I win. Like a client whose sports team lost\u2026</i></p><br/><p>It weighed on his heart, but he could not throw the match.</p><br/><p>A massive shadow appeared from the opposite entrance.</p><br/><p>The cheering he thought could not get any louder went up another level, and now it sounded like an explosion.</p><br/><p>In all honesty, he wanted a part of that cheering for himself, but he would simply have to claim it with his own strength.</p><br/><p>In YGGDRASIL, the voices of the supporters would slowly turn toward the challenger if they did well. In other words if Ainz fought well against the Martial Lord, more and more people would start to support Ainz.</p><br/><p><i>So it seems conditions like these where I hardly have any support are pretty good for advertising myself, no?</i></p><br/><p>He could slowly see the form of the Martial Lord.</p><br/><p>He wore a suit of full plate armor, and carried a gigantic club.</p><br/><p>As he beheld this walking fortress before him, Ainz\u2019s eyes \u2015 the flickering red flames within the empty orbits of his skull \u2015 narrowed into points.</p><br/><p><i>Hm\u2026 He looks about the same as the description. That being the case \u2015 no, that would be reckless. I\u2019d better be careful.</i></p><br/><p>According to the information Fluder had supplied, he did not possess any particularly lethal equipment.</p><br/><p>However, in YGGDRASIL, some people would prepare a set of identical-looking gear, equipped with completely different data crystals. In PVP matches, small tricks like that improved the chances of victory. Although backup gear was typically weaker than one\u2019s main panoply, being able to surprise a foe had effects beyond mere data values.</p><br/><p>He could not guarantee that the Martial Lord would not do that.</p><br/><p>Ainz took that into consideration as he continued to study the Martial Lord.</p><br/><p>He had heard of him before, but seeing the real thing made him think, \u201cNo wonder\u201d. That was probably what they meant by the saying \u201cseeing is believing\u201d. From what Fluder had told him, the creature under that armor looked very similar to the War Troll he had turned into a zombie, but the Martial Lord had a completely different air around him.</p><br/><p>One could say it was the difference between a domesticated pig and a wild boar.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026 interesting\u2026 Interesting?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz furrowed his eyebrows at his own excitement. He felt the same way as he did then; that this was going to be a good fight. Perhaps he was becoming a battle maniac, given the way he relished combat.</p><br/><p>That was not a good sign.</p><br/><p>The distance between them shrank. His opponent was the first to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am the War Troll Go Gin, known as the Martial Lord.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am \u2015\u201d here Ainz puffed out his chest. \u201cThe Sorcerer King, Ainz Ooal Gown, an undead being of the highest order, an Overlord.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so. Then let us fight with all our strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Oya?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz was quite surprised.</p><br/><p>There were two things about which he was curious, and he decided to start with the bigger one.</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to make fun of my name?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re asking why\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz tilted his head at the counter-inquiry. That was how it had gone back then.</p><br/><p>\u201cI seem to recall long names are something to you\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. It would seem you do understand my species well, Your Majesty. Indeed, my species considers those with short names to be strong. However, I have lived in this country for many years. During that time, I have learned that humans take long names. Thus, I will not make fun of such things. In addition, I sense that you are quite proud of that name, Your Majesty. Insulting the names of the strong is shameful for a warrior.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so\u2026 It would seem I need to revise my opinion of War Trolls now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFuhahahaha. No need for that. I am merely an outlier. In addition, different species have members with different opinions. That is all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Hahahaha! Indeed. I like you, Martial Lord\u2026 If I win, how about I keep you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz extended his right hand.</p><br/><p>Although it had been rejected back then, the present circumstances were different. The Martial Lord considered the matter, and replied:</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Alright. If I lose, I will become your subordinate. And if I win?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, that is a tricky question. What do you want? Name your desire.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Then I will have you, Your Majesty.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Hah?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo date, I have not encountered anyone worth killing for a meal. But if I can eat you, who are stronger than me, I will obtain your powers, Your Majesty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz calmed down a little. He had heard a lecture from a guildmate about the culture of cannibals. Although they ate people, the motive behind that was the same as the Martial Lord, to obtain the power of the enemy\u2019s soul. There were also other reasons for that, like fetishes and so on.</p><br/><p><i>At least it\u2019s not sexual. I wouldn\u2019t lose from that, but it would feel really gross if someone was looking at me in that way during a fight.</i></p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. After all, the right of life and death rests in the hands of the victor. So even if I kill you, you must not reject the resurrection.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz stepped forward. The Martial Lord assumed a fighting stance for a moment, but then he immediately relaxed.</p><br/><p>Ainz advanced with his right hand extended. The Martial Lord returned the gesture, extending his own massive right hand.</p><br/><p>This was less a handshake than the Martial Lord\u2019s hand swallowing up his own. A great cheer rose from the audience.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, I have another question. Why do you address me respectfully?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Martial Lord\u2019s attitude was not like a reigning champion greeting a challenger.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is only sensible to address the strong with respect.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see\u2026 Alright, I understand. That\u2019s all the questions I have. Let\u2019s start. How far apart should we be? Like the distance just now \u2015 about ten meters or so? I will strive to abide by the rules of this arena.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are no rules for distance, but it doesn\u2019t matter. You\u2019ll soon be within my striking range.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a handicap, a handicap.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Martial Lord did not speak, but nodded to show he understood.</p><br/><p>His face could not be seen, but his breathing and actions were calm.</p><br/><p>Had he seen through the taunt, or was that not enough to upset him?</p><br/><p>Ainz mentally clicked his tongue.</p><br/><p>What a troublesome foe. If his emotions were vulnerable, he could play on that, but one could not look down on a vigilant foe, even if they were lower in level.</p><br/><p>The Martial Lord turned his back to Ainz, and walked away.</p><br/><p>He turned back again after travelling about ten meters.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, we\u2019ll start when the bell goes, Your Majesty.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight\u2026 say, Martial Lord, I\u2019ve fought your kind before, but have you fought my kind before?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOverlords? No, I have not. I\u2019ve never heard of that undead\u2026 species.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so\u2026 Well, that\u2019s true. If you met anyone of my kind, you wouldn\u2019t be alive to stand here. Overlords are the highest-ranking undead\u2026 Then, have you fought any undead before?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ve never fought the undead. After all, the undead they bring here are obviously no match for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally now\u2026 Then I can\u2019t say \u2018don\u2019t think I\u2019m like the other undead you\u2019ve fought. I\u2019m several times more powerful than an Elder Lich\u2019\u2026 What a shame.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Martial Lord chuckled.</p><br/><p>Ainz shrugged, and raised his staff like a greatsword. Ainzach should be watching from behind, but he had not shown him his fighting stance as Momon, so it should be fine.</p><br/><p>The Martial Lord raised his gigantic club as well.</p><br/><p>The bell went off.</p><br/><p>In that instant, Ainz was swallowed up by an enormous black shadow.</p><br/><p><i>Cheh, he\u2019s fast!</i></p><br/><p>That was the shadow of a club swinging down.</p><br/><p><i>Block the strike with the staff</i> \u2015 Ainz wanted to do that, but immediately abandoned the notion. While he did not know enough about the enemy, the best thing to do in the face of a big move \u2015 one which was highly damaging \u2015 was to dodge.</p><br/><p>Thus, not caring if he lost his balance, Ainz threw himself into evasion.</p><br/><p>Ainz managed to dodge by the skin of his teeth. The club slammed into the ground, releasing a thunderous impact that even produced an echo. The smoke and dust it produced gusted up like an explosion.</p><br/><p>Worried about any follow-up strikes, Ainz fell back several paces.</p><br/><p>After the dust cleared, the shadow of the Martial Lord, club in hand, appeared from within it.</p><br/><p>A great cry rose up from the arena.</p><br/><p><i>Was it a martial art? Still\u2026 this is pretty exciting.</i></p><br/><p>He could clearly hear Jircniv\u2019s shouting his support amidst the ear-splitting cheers. \u201cGet him! He\u2019s right there!\u201d and other such childish cries.</p><br/><p>Ainz could not help but chuckle as he heard these cries from Jircniv, which were completely unlike him. He could not have imagined him acting like that from all the times he had spied on him in the Imperial City.</p><br/><p><i>\u2026He\u2019s an unexpectedly interesting chap\u2026</i></p><br/><p>Ainz\u2019s opinion of Jircniv rose rapidly. At first, he had believed that he was a perfect man with the air of an Emperor. However, now that he saw how passionate he was about the match, he felt that he could get along even better with him. Ainz\u2019s heart filled with a sense of closeness.</p><br/><p>Then, Ainz returned his attention to the Martial Lord.</p><br/><p>The Martial Lord was pointing that giant club of his toward him, implying that he would be intercepted if he came close and pursued if he backed off. It was a stance well-suited to pinning down one\u2019s opponents.</p><br/><p>It was a defensive stance that made full use of his weapon\u2019s length, practically turning it into a shield.</p><br/><p>In all honesty, Ainz had no clue how to break that stance of his.</p><br/><p><i>This\u2026 might be troublesome. It would seem being unable to use magic against an evenly-matched opponent is quite difficult. Well, I am a magic caster, after all\u2026</i></p><br/><p>That being the case , there was only one thing he could do.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell? Aren\u2019t you coming? Or will you cower there like a turtle?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, I will not let my guard down. Even though the rules keep you from using magic, the fact that you could dodge that strike cannot be taken lightly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, you want me to take the offensive? In that case, would you mind moving that club of yours aside? It\u2019s kind of in the way and makes it hard to attack.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Martial Lord did not answer. His keen gaze remained affixed on Ainz through the slits of his helmet\u2019s visor.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then\u2026 In that case, allow me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz savagely swung his staff at the tip of the club. The club forcefully struck the ground, as the Martial Lord grunted \u201cGgh!\u201d</p><br/><p>The impact should have been transmitted into the Martial Lord\u2019s hands and numbed them. In contrast, Ainz had no such biological functions.</p><br/><p>In an instant, Ainz charged into the Martial Lord\u2019s attack range.</p><br/><p>Ainz sent a mental command to his staff, and flames billowed from it. That said, \u201cbillowing flames\u201d simply meant a layer of fire that surrounded the staff. The flames did not constitute an attack in themselves. However, Ainz sensed the Martial Lord\u2019s attention shifting from himself to the staff.</p><br/><p><i>That\u2019s right. You Trolls have regenerative powers. Thus, it\u2019s perfectly rational to be mindful of weapons that negate your regeneration, such as those which can inflict fire or acid damage. However, that is a fatal mistake.</i></p><br/><p>Ainz touched the Martial Lord\u2019s armor with his empty left hand. In that moment, the Martial Lord shuddered like he had been electrocuted, making him swing his club without thinking.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz failed to dodge, and the sounds of cracking came from his body as he was smashed into the distance. Since he had disabled his High-Tier Physical Immunity and he was weak to bludgeoning attacks, that strike dealt a lot of damage. Ainz\u2019s body flew several meters, no, over 10 meters through the air, like a ball struck by a bat.</p><br/><p>Then, he hit the ground, tumbling head over heels several times.</p><br/><p>Thunderous cheering erupted from the crowd.</p><br/><p>Ainz heard Jircniv shouting in delight as he rolled across the ground, and the surge in goodwill he had toward the man dropped swiftly.</p><br/><p><i>Dammit, we\u2019re allied countries, aren\u2019t we? Shouldn\u2019t you be a bit more concerned about the fact that an allied king is down on the ground, huh?</i></p><br/><p>Though he had taken damage, Ainz no longer felt pain, and he peered at the Martial Lord from where he was on the ground.</p><br/><p>There was no follow-up attack.</p><br/><p>The sounds of cheering gradually died down, replaced by a sense of disquiet that covered the entire arena. Why had the Martial Lord not pressed the attack? No, why was the Martial Lord bending over? What was slowing down the Martial Lord\u2019s movements.</p><br/><p>Ainz gracefully rose to his feet, dusting himself off. He did not seem at all bothered at being sent flying.</p><br/><p>In contrast, the Martial Lord\u2019s movements were extremely sluggish.</p><br/><p>Ainz chuckled.</p><br/><p>This was the best way the show could have gone.</p><br/><p>Ainz returned to his original position, amidst a cacophony of noise. The Martial Lord asked in doubt:</p><br/><p>\u201cWh-what is this? Poison\u2026 no, what is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI did not break the rules. This is a proper contest. That said, this is far beyond the word \u2018poison\u2019. My touch can infuse negative energy into an opponent\u2019s body. However, a Troll\u2019s regeneration should be able to heal that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz made the same gesture he used when touching the Martial Lord, opening and closing his fingers.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, I have another ability in addition to that. I can inflict physical ability damage by touch. Thus, your strength and dexterity have been reduced. I don\u2019t think you can heal <i>that</i>, can you?\u201d</p><br/><p>From what Ainz knew, Trollish regeneration could only heal damage, but not the weakening of the body.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn other words, Martial Lord, the more I touch you, the lower your stats will become, until you end up like a caterpillar.\u201d</p><br/><p>Naturally, that was a lie.</p><br/><p>He could inflict ability penalties on a foe, that much was true, but even that had a limit. He could not reduce stats to zero. Of course, his opponent could not possibly know that.</p><br/><p>However, there were other undead with similar abilities, so he could not conclude that his opponent really did not know. He might have been bluffing about not fighting the undead, and he might know something related to them.</p><br/><p>That was why Ainz had openly stated the name of his species.</p><br/><p><i>Overlords are a very powerful species, and one which you know nothing about</i>. Once he left that impression in the Martial Lord\u2019s mind, he would feel that Ainz\u2019s power was mysterious and unfathomable. Ainz had mentioned that he was of the highest order and whatnot to further reinforce that sense of unease.</p><br/><p>The most important thing was that he had given an unnecessary explanation to the Martial Lord. That too was to confuse him with false information.</p><br/><p><i>\u2015Broadly speaking, all warfare is based on deception.</i></p><br/><p>Ainz calmly studied the Martial Lord, who did not seem to be recovering from his ability penalties.</p><br/><p>This was to see if the Martial Lord was trying to bluff with his actions.</p><br/><p>He might have the ability to recover from his ability penalties but chose not to use it, in order to create a fatal flaw in Ainz\u2019s defense. He might also have a talent, or some other hidden ability which Ainz knew nothing about.</p><br/><p>One could only trample one\u2019s foe in an open fight when there was an overwhelming difference in strength.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026The ability penalties I inflict will not heal with time, you know. I will shave away at your physical stats bit by bit, until I deliver the final blow with this staff, understood? Well, if you do, then let\u2019s continue.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz stepped forward, and the Martial Lord slowly took a stance.</p><br/><p>He could not see the Martial Lord\u2019s face because of his helmet. Was he laughing to himself, or was he growing anxious?</p><br/><p><i>The latter, I hope\u2026</i></p><br/><p>Ainz moved his left hand, the one which was not holding his staff. The Martial Lord shifted in response. It would seem he was very wary of it.</p><br/><p>The Martial Lord must be thinking that all he needed to do was worry about the left hand.</p><br/><p>That was it. During Ainz\u2019s experiments, he found that he could initiate touch attacks with any part of his body. If he felt like it, he could even use a headbutt to do so.</p><br/><p>As Ainz got closer, the Martial Lord backed away from him.</p><br/><p>Ainz laughed coldly.</p><br/><p>From their movements, it was readily apparent to the audience who had the advantage here.</p><br/><p><i>Do you know what the difference between us is, Martial Lord? Indeed, you might be better than me as a warrior. But there is something which decisively sets us apart.</i></p><br/><p>The biggest difference between himself and the Martial Lord was that of their HP.</p><br/><p>Ainz had the health of a level 100 character. Even if both parties abandoned defense and engaged in a slugging match, Ainz would emerge victorious.</p><br/><p>However, the problem lay in martial arts, those attacks which Ainz did not know about.</p><br/><p>\u201cI laid down another restriction on myself besides not using magic. That would concern magic items. I did not use magic items during this bout with you \u2015 in other words, I gave myself an equipment restriction. Still, this is thoroughly beneficial to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz possessed numerous magic items from his time in YGGDRASIL. Each and every one of them was a peerless treasure in this world. Thus, if Ainz had used those, he could have easily won his battle with the Martial Lord. However, Ainz did not feel that was the proper way to fight.</p><br/><p>Therefore, Ainz was equipped with low-tier items.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have restricted myself to using weapons which someone of your level can wield. On the other hand, I feel this is an excellent opportunity to test out a new acquisition.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz plunged his staff into the ground and withdrew two of the four stilettos sheathed at his waist. He gripped them tightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s test these weapons I borrowed from Momon.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Martial Lord probably did not understand Ainz\u2019s blathering. Ainz had no intention of enlightening him. He was simply talking to himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen \u2015 here I come.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz could not imitate that bizarre stance \u2015 that strange crouching start. However, after practice, he had learned to run in a similar way. He shot out like a loosed arrow, toward the Martial Lord.</p><br/><p>The distance was very short. Still, even in the brief opening before his opponent\u2019s attack, the Martial Lord\u2019s club swept across at him. The blow was slowed because his strength had been sapped by ability penalties, but it was a strike that should have connected.</p><br/><p>Ainz could not execute a magnificent dodge like that woman. However, Ainz could do something which that woman could not.</p><br/><p>He activated his ability, and the Martial Lord\u2019s movements halted for a moment.</p><br/><p>Ainz closed the gap between them and thrust his stiletto, aiming for the shoulder. That full-power strike, boosted by his running speed, shot out like an arrow.</p><br/><p>When she had hit him back then, she managed to damage Ainz\u2019s magically-created armor, which was harder than adamantite. This strike was on the same level as that, and the stiletto pierced the Martial Lord\u2019s armor and hide, penetrating the Martial Lord\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u2015However, in that moment\u2015</p><br/><p>\u201c[Reinforce Hide], [Greater Reinforce Hide]!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Martial Lord activated his martial arts.</p><br/><p>It was as though he had released something from within his body which pushed back against the tip of the stiletto</p><br/><p>The startling thing was that Ainz\u2019s full-strength hit only inflicted a tiny amount \u2015 a scratch\u2019s worth \u2015 of damage. With Trollish regeneration, that sort of damage would heal within seconds.</p><br/><p>The Martial Lord must have felt reassured by this. The club swinging toward Ainz was still very fast, and he had only taken a scratch from Ainz\u2019s all-out attack. One could say that victory was at hand for the Martial Lord.</p><br/><p>However, that would be a very foolish thing to say.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2015Activate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGoh! Gowaaaaaaaaah!!\u201d</p><br/><p>He released the spell, channelling the [Fireball] which Fluder had cast into the weapon into the place where he had stabbed the Martial Lord, thus burning his body from within. He thought of plunging his other stiletto into the opposite shoulder, but he was not strong enough, and the armor deflected it.</p><br/><p>As Ainz thought of targeting a chink in his armor, Ainz sensed movement from the Martial Lord and dashed to the side without looking.</p><br/><p>A gale blew from behind him. It must have been the wind pressure from that club.</p><br/><p>After fleeing for about 10 meters, Ainz turned back.</p><br/><p>The Martial Lord was grabbing at his shoulder with the arm holding his club. His other arm dangled beneath him, probably immobile. It would seem Fluder\u2019s spell was a little too strong. Perhaps he should have asked for a weaker magic caster to infuse it with magic.</p><br/><p>After realising the Martial Lord was in dire straits, the crowd wailed in sympathy.</p><br/><p>Ainz looked around the arena.</p><br/><p>No matter where he looked, he could not see anyone cheering for him.</p><br/><p><i>How strange\u2026 In YGGDRASIL, it wouldn\u2019t be unusual for someone to start cheering for me at this point\u2026 I guess away matches are hard.</i></p><br/><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped. I guess I\u2019ll have to abandon the plan of seizing the audience\u2019s heart. Now then, Martial Lord\u2026 time to die.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz sheathed the stiletto whose magic was expended and drew another one. This new stiletto was imbued with a 3rd-tier acid-element attack spell. He had prepared this in case the Martial Lord had rendered himself immune to fire damage.</p><br/><p>Granted, the Martial Lord looked like he had been hurt by that fire-elemental spell, but that might have been an act. Regenerating monsters could not completely resist attacks which shut down their regeneration, but that was only for YGGDRASIL.</p><br/><p>For all he knew, it might be possible in this world.</p><br/><p>If that was the case, his plan was to kill him by activating his skill when the audience \u2015 when everyone \u2015 could see that victory had been decided.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you admit defeat now\u2026 I\u2019ll end things here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026 Your Majesty. Not\u2026 not yet. I am still the Martial Lord. I am still the king of this arena. I will struggle until I die.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, take off your helmet and let me see your face.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a surprising request, but the Martial Lord complied, and showed his face.</p><br/><p>Sweat beaded on his forehead, and his face was twisted by what was probably intense pain. Yet, there was great strength in those eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose are good eyes. They remind me of Gazef Stronoff.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you. Being praised by a mighty being like yourself fills me with joy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Tell me. Do you have any moves which can beat me? Do you have any moves which can turn the tide?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2015I do not. Even so, I still wish to fight.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were very honest words.</p><br/><p>Ainz felt ashamed of using so many bluffs in this fight. In addition, there were all the abilities he had sealed off to make this a good match.</p><br/><p>Since his opponent was fighting in earnest, Ainz was obliged to respond with everything he could do, within the range of what he was allowed to do.</p><br/><p>The Martial Lord, who had come straight at Ainz, seemed to shine in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat would the Guardians think of the light in those eyes\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Still, he knew that they would scorn any being that was not of Nazarick. If that was the case \u2015 unease and loneliness filled Ainz.</p><br/><p>Ainz cast aside these emotions, and slowly raised his stilettos.</p><br/><p>The Martial Lord wiped off his sweat with his forearm, and put his helmet back on.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2015Come at me, Martial Lord.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGooohhhhhhh!\u201d</p><br/><p>With a roar, his vast body pressed in on Ainz.</p><br/><p>He was faster than just now. Perhaps he had activated a martial art.</p><br/><p>That incredible speed and that immense body \u2015 the two of them synergized to produce an overwhelming sense of oppression that would freeze any foe in place. No, that would apply to normal people, but the undead were immune to such mental effects.</p><br/><p>Ainz calmly studied the Martial Lord.</p><br/><p>He was fast \u2015 but that was all.</p><br/><p>His balance was off, probably because the shoulder pierced by the stiletto was unable to move.</p><br/><p><i>\u2015Worse than that time.</i></p><br/><p>More importantly\u2015</p><br/><p><i>Do you know the truth behind how I slowed you down? If you don\u2019t know, it\u2019ll be over for you, no?</i></p><br/><p>Ainz activated the same ability from just now.</p><br/><p>[Despair Aura I (Fear)]</p><br/><p>This ability had five effects.</p><br/><p>I was for Fear.</p><br/><p>II was for Panic.</p><br/><p>III was for Confusion.</p><br/><p>IV was for Insanity.</p><br/><p>V was for Instant Death.</p><br/><p>Fear referred to an abnormal status of being afraid, which inflicted a penalty to all actions.</p><br/><p>Panic was a more severe version of Fear, caused by stacking additional Fear effects on each other. Anyone afflicted by that status would want to flee the ability user at all costs \u2015 in other words, they would be unable to take any combat-related actions against that person.</p><br/><p>Confusion was as the name suggested. Without any recovery measures, the target would be in a state of confusion.</p><br/><p>Insanity was an extremely annoying bad status, being a permanent version of Confusion. It could not be removed without magic from a third party.</p><br/><p>And it went without saying that Instant Death caused death.</p><br/><p>The effects changed as one\u2019s level increased.</p><br/><p>Ainz had used the Fear effect first, and then cancelled it almost instantly afterward. By doing so, there would be a moment where the actions one imagined did not match up to the actual actions taken, and thus the body would feel as if it had been paralyzed.</p><br/><p>However, the Martial Lord had anticipated that this would happen if he tried a frontal attack. Even after his mind and body went out of sync, he still swung his club.</p><br/><p>After factoring in the combined penalties Ainz\u2019s touch and the fear status, evading the Martial Lord\u2019s attack should have been child\u2019s play. However\u2015</p><br/><p>\u201c[Strong Strike], [Divine Skill Single Flash]!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz thought he saw a flash of light.</p><br/><p>In that instant, intense pain \u2015 immediately suppressed to tolerable levels \u2015 and a floating sensation filled him.</p><br/><p>\u201c[Flow Acceleration]!\u201d</p><br/><p>A dull impact came from above, followed by a burst of pain in the next moment.</p><br/><p>Although he was briefly confused by the situation, Ainz quickly came to his senses.</p><br/><p>This was probably a two-hit combo. The first part launched Ainz into the air, while the second smashed him down into the ground.</p><br/><p>If he was Suzuki Satoru, he might not have been able to grasp the situation and fallen into confusion. However, Ainz Ooal Gown was immune to such bad statuses.</p><br/><p>Ainz knew that he was down on the ground, and that the club was coming down on him.</p><br/><p>\u201cCheh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz flipped away just as the club struck. Perhaps it was because of a martial art, but the impact flowed through the ground and into Ainz\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>However, this did not deal any additional damage.</p><br/><p>As Ainz leapt, the club that buried itself in the ground sprang up. That move, like dredging up something from the depths, seemed to say \u201cI\u2019ll finish you with this\u201d.</p><br/><p>Ainz made a split-second decision to block the strike with his stiletto, and Ainz\u2019s body sailed through the air once more. The audience\u2019s cheers rang through the arena, but the Martial Lord bitterly cursed, \u201cDammit!\u201d He had been hoping to finish off Ainz with that combination attack.</p><br/><p>After being knocked several meters through the air, Ainz tumbled a few times on the ground and then swiftly regained his stance as he muttered about himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing to turn the tide? He tricked me. Punitto Moe would scold me for this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Much like Ainz, the Martial Lord had saved his trump card \u2015 his martial arts \u2015 until the final moment. That proved he was a first-rate warrior.</p><br/><p>Ainz sheathed one of his stilettos, freeing up a hand.</p><br/><p>His arrogance and haste to seize victory had earned him a hard blow \u2015 no, two of them. It was time to discard his naive thinking. He would cut his opponent\u2019s stats down to size before ending things.</p><br/><p><i>How noisy\u2026</i></p><br/><p>The audience\u2019s cheers were really annoying. They had just been wailing, and now they were rejoicing. Especially\u2015</p><br/><p><i>\u2015Dammit, Jircniv! What the hell do you mean, \u201cfinish him?!\u201d Ah, seriously\u2026</i></p><br/><p>Ainz moved slowly. He had not been severely injured, but he had been punished for his carelessness with pain, so he would not make that sort of mistake again.</p><br/><p><i>Still, I really don\u2019t get martial arts. These are skills which don\u2019t exist in YGGDRASIL\u2026 did someone develop them to counter YGGDRASIL players? Or am I just trying to force a theory here\u2026? Hang on, that martial art should have been something which increased attack speed. He\u2019ll probably try that again, so I\u2019d better prepare my body for it, no?</i></p><br/><p>(TL Note: Once again Ainz seems to have misremembered a saying, \u3092\u3089\u305b\u3066\u3092\u3064, to prepare your flesh to be cut and your bones to be broken. Of course, he has no flesh\u2026)</p><br/><p>Ainz entered the Martial Lord\u2019s reach, and the Martial Lord swung down. Yet Ainz did not evade.</p><br/><p>He advanced, taking the Martial Lord\u2019s attacks.</p><br/><p>The pressure and pain filled him, but he could do this, given the huge difference in their HP. It was fine. In addition, his undead body immediately suppressed his pain, so he could bear agony which the living could not endure.</p><br/><p>In this way, Ainz touched the Martial Lord\u2019s body. Having just finished an attack \u2015 and being under the influence of the fear status from Ainz\u2019s aura \u2015 it was quite difficult to evade it.</p><br/><p>Then, he maintained contact with the Martial Lord\u2019s body and circled around to his back. Of course, he was continuously infusing the ability-damaging negative energy through his armor.</p><br/><p>\u201cUooooooooh!\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, it was the Martial Lord who backed away from him, as though rolling along the ground.</p><br/><p>Ainz was puzzled over whether or not to pursue, but decided to stay still, in case of some hidden move.</p><br/><p>The Martial Lord ponderously raised his weapon. His breathing was ragged, and his imposing demeanor from when they had first met was gone.</p><br/><p>Ainz gripped his stilettos tightly.</p><br/><p>The preparations were complete. This would be the final strike.</p><br/><p>Perhaps he had sensed the change in the air, but the Martial Lord removed his helmet and cast it aside.</p><br/><p>As surprise began to fill Ainz, the Martial Lord shed the rest of his armor as well. While he was currently weakened, it did not seem to be at a level where he was unable to move due to the weight of his armor.</p><br/><p>However, after seeing the determination on the Martial Lord\u2019s face, Ainz understood his plan.</p><br/><p><i>I see. Armor protects against the stilettos, but it does nothing against ability penalties. He must feel quite threatened by it, which is why he\u2019s gambling on his foe\u2019s HP being low and lightening the load on his body, just so he can continue attacking.</i></p><br/><p>That was his final \u2015 and also a very disadvantageous \u2015 gamble.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me\u2026 Am I weak?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty. you have not revealed a fraction of your true power until now. Even without the mighty wings of your magic, this is clearly not taxing you. Am\u2026 Am I really that weak?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz closed his eyes in thought, and then he opened them again.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, you are weak.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Is that so.\u201d</p><br/><p>The arena fell silent.</p><br/><p>Ainz\u2019s voice had not reached them. However, the victory was already decided in their eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cDuring this battle, I forbade myself the use of many magic items and the use of all sorts of abilities.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOtherwise, you would have ended this in an instant?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz nodded in confirmation.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust so. However, I know about you, so\u2015\u201d Ainz shook his head. This was not meant to comfort him. \u201cWell, you just had a bad opponent. If you are the strongest man in the Empire\u2026 I may well be the strongest man in the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see\u2026 Still\u2026 I am glad. Knowing that someone is better than me is what drives me to improve.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI do understand that, to some extent.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were some of his friends \u2015 for instance, Touch Me \u2015 whom he had never beaten in PVP. Even so, he looked back fondly on how he had pondered the ways to beat his tactics and equipment.</p><br/><p>Ainz smiled to the Martial Lord, and the Martial Lord smiled to Ainz.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Then, make your move.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2015Your Majesty, Sorcerer King Ainz Ooal Gown. At the very end, please show me \u2015 even if it is just a fraction \u2015 of your true power. Allow me to experience the zenith of might!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Martial Lord forcefully brandished his weapon.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally now\u2026 Very well. Then I shall reveal the pinnacle of power to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz activated his skill, and strode forth.</p><br/><p>He entered the Martial Lord\u2019s attack range. The Martial Lord swung down.</p><br/><p>It was completely different from the speed at which he had raised it. He might have used martial arts to accelerate it. Still, it was nothing compared to the speed before he had his abilities penalized. It was far too slow.</p><br/><p>The club swung down on Ainz\u2019s body, but Ainz paid it no heed.</p><br/><p>The attack could no longer harm Ainz\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Ainz walked through it, as though caressed by a gentle wind.</p><br/><p>He took blow after blow, but Ainz continued advancing, looking straight into the Martial Lord\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>The Martial Lord smiled, as though giving up. Ainz plunged his stiletto into the Martial Lord\u2019s unresisting chest, and then released the spell imbued within.</p><br/><p>\u2666 \u2666 \u2666</p><br/><p>Ainz looked down on the Martial Lord\u2019s corpse.</p><br/><p>Then, he activated a borrowed magic item. It was a simple loudspeaker.</p><br/><p>\u201cHear me! People of the Empire! I am the Sorcerer King, Ainz Ooal Gown!\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice seemed to echo with a high-pitched whine of feedback amidst the silence. Thus, Ainz decided to wrap this up quickly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI intend to establish a program to train and raise adventurers within my country. This is because I consider it advantageous for my country to both cultivate and protect adventurers, and send them travelling to various places in the world. Many adventurers must survive with their own resources. But how many have been cut down before they reached their prime?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz recalled the adventurer team he had travelled with for a short time.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Therefore, I intend to incorporate the Adventurer\u2019s Guild into my nation. There are those who fear that they will lose their freedom and be shackled down once the Adventurer\u2019s Guild becomes a national organization. I cannot completely rule that out. However, like I have just shown, my strength is more than adequate. I do not intend to use you as tools for war. The Sorcerous Kingdom thirsts those who truly seek adventure! All you who wish to explore the unknown, who wish to understand the world and thus dream of becoming adventurers, come to me! I will help you stand on your own, with the aid of power you cannot imagine. Now behold a fraction of that might!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz walked over to the Martial Lord.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Martial Lord is dead! Who will verify his death?\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cDeath is the end of everything. Yet \u2015 as some here might know, death can be fought off.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz withdrew a wand, and pointed it at the Martial Lord\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>It would be terribly embarrassing if he did not come back to life. His nonexistent heart pounded within his chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cWitness this!\u201d</p><br/><p>The wand activated, and then the Martial Lord gasped. Then, his chest began moving.</p><br/><p>\u201cResurrection magic is the province of high-level priests. However, it is not a challenge for me! That said, the appropriate payment in gold must still be made! I, who have conquered death, shall back you up! Come to my nation, you who seek to become true adventurers!\u201d</p><br/><p>Amidst the tides of sound, Ainz cast a [Fly] spell.</p><br/><p>His destination was Jircniv\u2019s VIP room.</p><br/><p>Glancing around, he noticed that only Jircniv and his two bodyguards were left. The others seemed to have departed early. Ainz was delighted at having less to worry about, but he said nothing.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, sorry about that just now, Jircniv-dono. Oya, your face looks better now. What a relief.\u201d</p><br/><p>His dizziness when standing up seemed genuine. However \u2015 since he had been cheering so energetically, it must have only been for a moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cI apologize for worrying you, Gown-dono.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhh, don\u2019t mind it. Anyone would be worried if they saw someone they knew looking unwell.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for your concern. Still, that was an exciting match. As expected of you, Gown-dono. To think you could triumph so easily over the Empire\u2019s strongest warrior. There are no words for that but \u2018magnificent\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCertainly not. This was a good bout. It could have gone both ways; I simply had luck on my side.\u201d</p><br/><p>Given the way Jircniv was cheering for the Martial Lord, he must have been a big fan. That being the case, he could not go wrong by praising the Martial Lord.</p><br/><p>Or rather\u2015</p><br/><p><i>\u2015Damn you, you didn\u2019t cheer for me at all. I heard it!</i></p><br/><p>Of course, he could not voice these thoughts. When one thought calmly about it, in a battle between the warriors of one\u2019s own nation and that of another country, it was only natural for one to cheer for one\u2019s own countrymen.</p><br/><p>Well, if he had actually cheered for Ainz, his affection meter \u2015 a phrase Peroroncino frequently used \u2015 would probably have gone through the roof.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhile outsiders might not be able to tell, I am sure you are not mistaken, Gown-dono. Then, next \u2015 forgive me. What am I saying at this time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d Ainz agreed. Put in another way, he did not wish to be chatting with Jircniv for so long in a place like this.</p><br/><p>He did not want him to realize that Ainz Ooal Gown was just a mortal man.</p><br/><p>Although he thought he would be scolded for promoting the Sorcerous Kingdom in the arena and for his illegal border crossing, Jircniv did not seem to want to rebuke him. That being the case, it was best for him to quickly make his exit.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s\u2015\u201d Ainz swallowed the informal words he was about to speak. That would be like digging his own grave. \u201cLet us end things here for now. I shall come to visit another day, Jircniv-dono.\u201d</p><br/><p>Personally, Ainz wanted to escape with teleportation magic, but he had to go pick up Ainzach first. So he would return to the ground, and then teleport away \u2015 and then, as he was pondering that matter, Ainz realized that Jircniv was staring at him, a serious look on his face.</p><br/><p>He was definitely going to say something weird.</p><br/><p>This situation was familiar to any salaryman. Ainz turned to look at Jircniv.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty. I have a proposal. May I prevail upon you to hear it?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>No.</i> How wonderful would the world be if he could say that?</p><br/><p>Ainz decided not to run away from reality. He smiled \u2015 although his face did not move \u2015 and replied with a \u201cDo continue.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, I hope \u2015 no, the Baharuth Empire would like to become a vassal state of the Sorcerous Kingdom of Ainz Ooal Gown.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Hah?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz could not help but exclaim at those thoroughly unexpected words.</p><br/><p>His brain had not yet parsed what he had just heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cVas\u2015 a vassal state?\u201d</p><br/><p>His guards \u2015 both of whom he had seen before \u2015 were also staring in shock.</p><br/><p>For some reason, Ainz felt like patting Jircniv on the forehead.</p><br/><p>Why had he suddenly requested vassal status? Come to think of it, what sort of relationship did vassal states have, anyway? He recognized the word, but what exactly did it mean? Then there was all that self-governing stuff and so on.</p><br/><p>Ainz could not decide something important like that by himself. He would need to discuss this matter with Demiurge and Albedo first before giving an answer.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Jircniv-dono, taking your nation as a vassal state\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><i>So the plan of forming a bond of friendship between kings is\u2026 eh?</i></p><br/><p>What should he say about the vassal state issue? Would it be alright to go with \u201cI had not considered it\u201d?</p><br/><p>However, Demiurge and the others might have intended to vassalize the Empire. He did not wish to put his own head in a noose, and yet it might be troublesome to leave it unaddressed.</p><br/><p>It would seem the best option was to bluff his way through, somehow.</p><br/><p>After deciding on the direction his words would take, Ainz made his reply.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is too dangerous to verbally agree on such matters. I cannot make an immediate reply, but I believe such issues should be set down in writing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, does it mean that once I hand the document to you, you will approve of it?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Eh? There\u2019s seriously going to be one? </i>Ainz thought of asking that, but he managed to swallow those words. It was probably because he had calmed down somewhat. The truth was, he was no longer perturbed as he had been just now. He could not thank this body of his enough.</p><br/><p>Still, the problem was yet to be solved.</p><br/><p><i>That\u2019s not what I meant, I\u2019m just stalling for time.</i> Since he could not speak those words, he had to think of something that Jircniv could accept. There was no other way.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Certainly. Then, do send a copy of the petition for vassalage as well as a draft of the Empire\u2019s future status and treatment to my residence in the Sorcerous Kingdom, Jircniv-dono. After that, we shall plan at length.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I shall do so. I will endeavour to finish it swiftly and deliver it to Your Majesty\u2019s hands. \u2015Then, for the time being, please allow me to speak to you as a king \u2015 as an equal. I shall be in your care.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although his emotional state had calmed down, Ainz still had no idea what was going on and why the situation had ended up like this. He simply nodded in response.</p><br/><p>Then, trying not to appear too panicked, Ainz descended onto the arena with a [Fly] spell.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did it all end up like this? Or rather, what would Demiurge and Albedo do\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz rounded his shoulders, like a child who was certain he would be scolded by his parents when he got home.</p><br/><p>\u2666 \u2666 \u2666</p><br/><p>The air in the VIP room was silent in the wake of the Sorcerer King\u2019s departure. As though to shatter this silence, Nimble shouted:</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jircniv furrowed his brows in an exaggerated manner as he looked at Nimble.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being too loud. I\u2019m still nearby.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor-forgive me. But, but, may I know what just happened?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou wish to know why I made a decision like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nimble nodded in response. Jircniv glanced to Baziwood, who had a similar attitude.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see\u2026 Then, what else would you suggest I do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jircniv laughed at himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cEver since he came here, along with his \u2015 ah! Negotiations with the Slaine Theocracy have broken down. The temples don\u2019t think well of me either. How long would it take to bring the matter of those negotiations up again? Is that even a problem which can be solved with enough time?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jircniv thought about what he would do if he were one of the higher-ups in the Slaine Theocracy. If another country gave an excuse as pathetic as, \u201cThat was just Ainz Ooal Gown seeing through our scheme, we didn\u2019t intend for anything else,\u201d they would surely think there was no value in allying with that country and abandon it. No, they might end up using that country as fuel for some kind of plot in the future.</p><br/><p>It would seem an alliance with the Slaine Theocracy was pretty much out of the question.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo he\u2019s saying, \u2018please struggle as hard as you can by yourself without the Theocracy as allies\u2019, hm? My my, as expected of His Majesty, the Sorcerer King Ainz Ooal Gown. I have to take my hat off to him. His reach is truly longer than I could have imagined. First, he lets his foes grow proud, and then he destroys them in one hit when they lower their guard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Though he was an enemy, Jircniv could not help but praise that perfect scheme.</p><br/><p>It was so perfectly calculated that he had no choice but to admit defeat. There was no sign of any reinforcements for the Empire, while Ainz already had solid proof of the Empire\u2019s actions. In other words, Ainz held the power of life and death over the Empire.</p><br/><p>Baziwood shook his head. It would seem they understood the situation they were in.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh, this is really\u2026 how shall I put this. He really put the boot in. He hit you right in your weak spot. Something like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly. I can\u2019t think of any way to deal with him. I guess I\u2019m broken in mind and body. It feels like anything would be fine at this point.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty\u2026\u201d Nimble looked toward Jircniv, speaking quietly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not so much undead as he is a devil. It feels as if he knows how to thoroughly break a man\u2019s will.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStill, even so, becoming a vassal state\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jircniv looked gently upon Nimble, who still seemed unable to accept it.</p><br/><p>He could understand the man\u2019s feelings.</p><br/><p>However, he would have preferred a rationally considered solution to this problem, rather than that childish revelation of his feelings. Still, if even Jircniv could not solve that problem, how much more so for Nimble?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll speak plainly now. We cannot win. The only option we have is, as I said earlier, to subvert his subordinates. I cannot imagine any other way to oppose him. As you might have felt in that war, it\u2019s clear that he\u2019s most powerful as a magic caster.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two knights nodded in agreement.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen how is he as a warrior? Can you kill him with a sword?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jircniv shrugged.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should have seen it, right? Even as a warrior, the Martial Lord could not beat him. And what was that? He took the Martial Lord\u2019s attack and remained unhurt? Did he use magic?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure, but it might be possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally now. In other words, he can render any attack ineffective with magic, then? So assassination is impossible. Could he be immortal?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, he has a physical body, so I doubt he\u2019s immortal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why was he unhurt?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nimble was left dumbfounded, and he turned to Baziwood beside him for help. However, Baziwood kept his lips pressed flat into a straight line.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026So, let\u2019s do this for now. Gather all the information you can about the Martial Lord\u2019s weapon, and then we\u2019ll round up all the magic casters and adventurers we can find to ask them about why he was unhurt. Fortunately, that pronouncement of his should have set him against the Adventurer\u2019s Guild, so they should be happy to help us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, shouldn\u2019t we have offered vassalage after trying all of those? Fortunately, he refused.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jircniv was somewhat annoyed by this, but he suppressed his displeasure and did not show it. Instead, he looked at Nimble with a troubled expression on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cFortunately? Do you really think of it that way? I think it\u2019s the other way around. On the contrary, is it not best to push for vassalization as quickly as possible?\u201d Jircniv asked Nimble, who had a baffled expression on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you think he would refuse our offer of vassalage?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat, that is\u2026 your servant is unsure\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps if he were incompetent, unsure of how to handle the changing situation \u2015 he might think of something like that. However, our opponent is that man, remember? Judging by his intellect, he must have already come up with a plan for the future in the brief period after we proposed vassalage. If he refused the offer after thinking it through, that would indicate something about that course of action did not mesh with his aims.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd what would that be?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jircniv\u2019s face turned bitter from Baziwood\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Still, well, it probably can\u2019t be good for us. Otherwise he would not be so disturbed by the offer of vassalage. For all we know, the objectives he has in mind are things which he cannot carry out in his own country. In that case\u2015\u201d</p><br/><p>Jircniv let his overworked brain, which was soon to emit smoke, run wild.</p><br/><p>His opponent was that Ainz Ooal Gown. He must surely have some objective in mind.</p><br/><p>As the king of the Sorcerer Kingdom, what would he want? What would he hate?</p><br/><p>Sweat beaded on his forehead, and Jircniv struggled to think.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2015The Adventurer\u2019s Guild? Could it be he wants to do something to the Adventurer\u2019s Guild, which is why he opposed the vassalage?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about that declaration? \u2026Would permitting it be a good idea, Your Majesty? In a few years\u2019 time, a lot of the best and brightest of the Empire might end up flowing out of the country.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I did not get that at all. Tell me how you arrived at that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhile doing as he says means that one\u2019s freedom might be restricted, having the incredibly powerful Sorcerer King as backing is a very attractive proposition. In the adventuring profession, far more people die than manage to make a name for themselves. However, with someone that powerful supporting them\u2026 well, at least that\u2019s what those people with no confidence in themselves will think. Also, since we have knights, there aren\u2019t many jobs for low-ranked adventurers in the first place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAn outflow of talent\u2026 Although they may not have faith in themselves, it doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not capable.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were people who were talented, yet lacked self-confidence. Yet, it would take a very confident person to explore a new world.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, aren\u2019t these all reasons to oppose vassalization? Still\u2026 wouldn\u2019t it be more convenient for us to become a vassal state? That way, he can swallow up the Adventurer\u2019s Guild up directly\u2026 Ah! Ainz Ooal Gown! Why must your intellect surpass mine so greatly?! Your schemes are so fiendish I can\u2019t even begin to comprehend them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it possible that he\u2019s not thinking about anything at all?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jircniv glared hatefully at Baziwood\u2019s joking comment.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat nonsense is that? He anticipated our movements to this degree\u2026 no, it\u2019s unthinkable. We also need to consider the effects of his unknowable feelings that drive him to hate the living\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps assuming that he thought like one of the undead was a mistake.</p><br/><p>Perhaps Ainz had already anticipated that he would agonize and guess about this, and worked it into his plan. He might well be waiting with open arms for a panicked Jircniv to hasten the vassalization process.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat should we do now?\u201d Nimble asked. He was referring to the Empire\u2019s future actions.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I intend to spread the news to the surrounding countries. First, I will gather the scribes and tell them in rough terms that the Empire chooses submission and to become a vassal state of the Sorcerous Kingdom, and that we have no choice in the matter. We will get the news out to the surrounding countries quickly and let it spread, so the Sorcerous Kingdom has no choice but to acknowledge it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them lowered their heads. The fact that even Baziwood had an expression like that on his face made Jircniv wonder if it was a joke.</p><br/><p>He deleted the bitter smile from his face, and spoke in a friendly manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy so glum? There are all sorts of vassal states. If we are allowed to govern ourselves for the most part, then we can continue living as we always have. No \u2015 if the Sorcerous Kingdom defends us with their incredible power, then would we not be safer than before?\u201d</p><br/><p>As they heard about a slightly brighter future(probably), a little color returned to their faces.</p><br/><p>\u201cTherefore, we need to deal with any internal dissatisfaction. If the Sorcerous Kingdom does not allow us to rule ourselves, the Empire might start to fragment. There might be factions which are not pleased with vassalage that might make their move as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jircniv began thinking about the disposition of the factions within the Empire.</p><br/><p>The most important ones were the Knight Corps. However, they would not switch over to the anti-vassalage faction. Even if they opposed it , it would only be lip service. They would not actually take action.</p><br/><p>Next were the nobles. They could not be predicted. While there were few people who would complain about Jircniv\u2019s decision, those few might be aiming for a chance to depose the Bloody Emperor. These were people who might try anything to become the new rulers of the vassalized Empire.</p><br/><p>The commoners could be deceived. To them, as long as life went on as normal, they would not mind becoming a vassal state.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2015The priests will be a problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>The temples would never acknowledge this. And, it would be worse if the temples not only opposed it, but forbade all recuperative activity. He would need to talk with them repeatedly and get them to come over to his thinking.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Will you be alright, Your Majesty?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho knows? While I\u2019m around, we\u2019ll have the best chance of vassalizing, and I plan to show the results of doing so\u2026 but that might not be good to say.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Why me,</i> he thought.</p><br/><p>He had inherited this task from his father, and the Empire had steadily grown stronger. He should not have misstepped at any point during that process.</p><br/><p>But then that monster appeared, and everything had gone mad.</p><br/><p>There was probably nothing wrong in the way he negotiated with that monster. It was simply that Ainz Ooal Gown was a being whose thought processes transcended those of mankind.</p><br/><p>In just a month, everything had changed.</p><br/><p>Jircniv sighed deeply.</p><br/><p>\u201cI must be the unluckiest man in the world\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Though that was merely idle chatter, the news of Silver Canary changing their home base from the Empire to the City-State Alliance soon reached the demoralized Jircniv. In the coming days, Jircniv would come to bemoan this as \u201cblessings do not come in pairs, while calamities do not come alone.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Did it excite you? Books get tiring to carry when they\u2019re heavy and I\u2019d like to avoid that, so why did it end up so long\u2026 And if I were to cut pages, where should I cut from? By the way, this has already been heavily cut down from the original proofreading. It feels like there were at least six more pages before\u2026 Hm. I guess there wasn\u2019t much of a change, after all.</p><br/><p>Well, please forgive me and just think of this as a form of savings, then. I think in the future, the volumes will only be 300 pages long. When that happens, please don\u2019t think \u201cso thin!\u201d, but instead consider that the use of what\u2019s been saved until now. After all, it\u2019ll still be quite thick if you average all the books out.</p><br/><p>Then, let\u2019s think about other things \u2014 I\u2019m writing this on a hot summer day. The AC in my room is working at full blast and saving Maruyama from the scorching fires of hell.</p><br/><p>I hate summer. When I walk to the office, there\u2019s nothing I hate more than touching other people with my sweaty body. \u201cI won\u2019t touch you, so don\u2019t touch me,\u201d I scream internally. The only salvation is that the decrease in students means the trains aren\u2019t so packed. On that note, winters are great! I want to sleep under the blanket and never get out! \u2026Well, the people in Hokkaido and Tohoku might not think that way, but Maruyama still wants to say; Winters Are The Best!</p><br/><p>It seems the Overlord Compilation Movie will be made in the Best Season! For some reason, it seems Maruyama has to work hard\u2026 I\u2019ll work hard. And that\u2019s that. There should be more news coming out in future, and I\u2019d be happy if you could look forward to it.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ve given a lot of people this time round too. So-bin-sama, I made you redraw the insert images several times, thank you very much. To my editor Ohaku-sama, I\u2019ll reduce the pagecount for sure next time! And thank you for doing the design for the deluxe edition package this time round, Chord Design Studio-sama.</p><br/><p>Then there\u2019s Ashina-san and the staff; just hand the gags to them and it\u2019ll be alright.</p><br/><p>(Please watch the deluxe edition if you bought it, everyone)</p><br/><p>F-ta-sama, let\u2019s meet up to discuss how to cut down the page count.</p><br/><p>And a big thank you to my readers who have finished this (very thick) light novel!</p><br/><p>2016 SeptemberMaruyama Kugane</p><br/><p> \u304f\u304c\u306d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

As pocket watches were closely linked to everyday life, they were fairly cheap, as far as magic items went. That said, they were still not something a commoner could afford.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Climb had borrowed the pocketwatch which he now bore, and so it differed from regular magic items in that it possessed a magical ability. The name of the watch was Twelve Magical Power. Once per day, when the watch reached a set time, it would unleash its magic.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>However, one would need to have carried the pocket watch for at least a full day in order to enjoy that ability, so Climb \u2015 who had just obtained this watch \u2015 could not make use of its magic.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHm? Is it time already? That was fast\u2026\u201d said the girl who seemed to be looking aimlessly at the blue sky. Naturally, those words were addressed to Climb.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt seems that way,\u201d Climb answered the girl \u2015 Tina, a member of the adamantite-ranked adventurer party \u201cBlue Rose\u201d.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHm~ It\u2019s hard to tell the time when we\u2019re spacing out.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>One could poke many holes in that statement.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>To begin with, Tina was not spacing out. She was guarding the main door of the building behind Climb. While she had said things like \u201cIs it time already\u201d and \u201cThat was fast\u201d, the fact was that she had a very acute perception of time.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>There were some people in the adventuring community whose time perception was preternaturally keen. In particular, many people in the thieving profession had trained up that ability. It was very important to them, given that they often needed to move independently on stealth operations.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHm? Were you about to say something?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo, not really.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Tina replied with a \u201cIs that so,\u201d when she heard Climb\u2019s answer, and then looked at the sky again.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>She was hiding something. Yet, there was no way someone like Climb could ask why she was lying.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>In the first place, they did not have the money to hire Tina and the others; they just happened to be operating in the same area by chance. Given their lack of manpower, he could not do anything which might upset her.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen, I will go report to the Princess.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSee ya~\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Climb turned toward the building he had been protecting all this while.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>He had seen it during its construction several times, but this was the first time he had laid eyes on it after it was complete. The size of the building \u2015 and the presence of his mistress within it \u2015 filled the depths of Climb\u2019s heart with warmth.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>After opening the door, the unique scent of recently-completed woodwork reached Climb\u2019s nose.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>He continued forward, and after passing through the corridor, he opened the door to a room in the depths of the building.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Within that room was his mistress.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>She was a stunningly beautiful princess, Renner.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Surrounding her were several children.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The way she smiled tenderly at the rowdy children and the posture which she took to listen to their words made all who saw her think of a saint. </span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>As he beheld this picturesque scene, Climb lost the ability to speak.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>He was afraid that he would ruin this sacrosanct vision before him. The same applied to the women who stood by the window, none of whom dared do anything unnecessary.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>However, someone within the room did not share their feelings.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOi, it\u2019s the little punk. Well, it\u2019s about time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Renner raised her head in response to the cold voice which came from below the mask, and looked directly at Climb.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Climb could see himself reflected in those eyes which reminded him of sapphires.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2026My deepest apologies, Renner-sama. It is time to return to the Palace.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIs that so~ Then, although it pains me to do so, I must take my leave.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The kids chorused \u201cEhhhhhh~\u201d, in voices filled with longing and reluctance. They would not have made such a sound if she had not thoroughly ensnared their hearts.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>In response to the children, the other women hurriedly sprang into action. They patted the children soothingly, and pulled away those children who were slower on the uptake from Renner\u2019s side.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cEveryone, can I come play with you again?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The kids energetically answered in the affirmative to Renner\u2019s question.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen, we\u2019ll cook next time. Climb, let\u2019s go, You too, Evileye-san.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHm~ Well, I\u2019m your bodyguard too, even if you don\u2019t say it \u2015 although, since this isn\u2019t a request, it\u2019s more like we happen to be travelling together. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be behind you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The group exited the building just as a horse-drawn carriage drew up nearby.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Tina entered the carriage without introducing herself. Although it seemed like she was being rude, she was simply ensuring the safety of the carriage. Shortly after that, Renner, Climb and finally Evileye entered one after the other, and then the carriage set off.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Within the bumpy carriage, Evileye could not help but mumble:</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2026It must have been pretty hard to build an orphanage like that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cPretty hard?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes. A lot of people are saying that too. Where in the world did you get all that money to spend on a place like that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Renner cupped her chin with one hand, tilting her head slightly.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI don\u2019t think so, right? Onii-sama was quite happy to listen to my request. Besides, it\u2019s because the world is like this that we need to take good care of the children, right?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Evileye raised her chin slightly, as though to permit her to continue speaking.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAs we all know, the ruler of the Sorcerous Kingdom has caused many deaths. As a result, I believe there are many orphans who have lost their parents. Thus, this orphanage was built to protect those orphans. In addition, those women who have lost their husbands will also need a place to work, right?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe Sorcerer King, huh\u2026 well, we\u2019ll talk about that later. Couldn\u2019t that money be better spent on things besides these brats? If you ask me, the weak losing their lives is just the way things work in this world, no?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s not right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Renner\u2019s statement was clear and succinct. Unlike her tone from just now, those words were filled with tremendous power.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSaving the weak is what the strong should do. And\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Climb felt Renner\u2019s eyes suddenly turning to him.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i><span>Perhaps\u2015</span></i></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The image of himself as a child appeared in Climb\u2019s mind.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Perhaps the Princess had built the orphanage because she remembered his state from that time. In a way, it was to prevent children like Climb from appearing again.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>A wave of heat flashed through his chest.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Of course, he could not verify the Princess\u2019 actual thoughts. Even so, Climb did not doubt that it was that way.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure some people would think that way, And it seems wrong to force my own views on others. Still, did you really have to make it so big?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes. After all, we have to consider that we will take in many children in the future, and there will be others from those regions directly administered by the Crown. With that in mind, even a building of that size might not be big enough. Children are my treasure, and we need to take care of them to make sure they don\u2019t go down the wrong path.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHmmm. Hime-sama, that\u2019s a good head on your shoulders.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat are you trying to say, Tina?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI was thinking about how children without their parents would live, Evileye.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat is\u2026 I see\u2026 since we can\u2019t spare precious manpower to replenish the depleted number of troops, you\u2019re using alternate means to maintain public order\u2026 I see.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOne can live a good and righteous life under supervision. But people will end up following their desires if they are not careful. And then, when they commit those crimes, they will fall further into wickedness. Thus do small sins grow larger, like a rolling snowball, so we should not let such chances appear. However, since it is difficult, we use these methods to reduce those chances.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHm. So you\u2019re saying, \u2018\u2015Not everyone has a strong will\u2019, then?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWell, people have said that about you before, Evileye \u2015 could it be it\u2019s bothering you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI think she\u2019s said something like that about three times already.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>While the latter half was something that nobody but Evileye and Tina could understand, the first half was simple enough that even Climb could understand.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Those children who had lost their parents often turned to crime in order to survive. If that happened, even the weakened Eight Fingers would soon return to full strength, which would worsen the security of the Royal Capital.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>In other words, his beloved lady had done this to prepare for the future.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>However \u2015 Renner asked Evileye in a curious tone:</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2015What does that mean?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOi\u2026 did we read too deeply into it? Or is this just an act?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHm~ it looked genuine enough at a glance.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWell, if you say so, then it must be true. I feel like I was moved for nothing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWell, it feels like you\u2019ve decided to lower your opinion of me all of a sudden\u2026 but, it\u2019s true. I think about a lot of things, you know? Right now, this orphanage is giving these kids a certain degree of education, and once we start identifying talented individuals among them, the other nobles will surely start to copy us. Because of that, we need a certain amount of kids\u2026 Although that\u2019s not really something to be proud of.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo, I can understand gathering those brats for that reason, and it\u2019s pretty admirable too. If you can actually produce results, it would be worthy of praise. It\u2019s just that people are going to be suspicious if you do something without expecting anything in return.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cEvileye\u2019s heart is twisted because she works too hard.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOi! You\u2019re the same type as me, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCertainly not. I am very pure. It\u2019s only you who has been stained.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i><span>Cheh!</span></i><span> The sound of an explosive scoff came from beneath the mask.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYup, yup. Brain-san gave me the idea of building the orphanage.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBrain Unglaus, huh. What happened to him. How come he isn\u2019t around today?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBrain-san is busy with something else. He\u2019s running around the Capital now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHoh? Could there be something more important than protecting the Princess?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes. He\u2019s doing something in order to fulfil the wishes of the late Warrior-Captain. And, about the Warrior-Captain\u2026 well, thank you for your help.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Tina narrowed her eyes, as though to conceal her feelings.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWell, I\u2019m pretty annoyed that our oni leader\u2019s pretty face got hurt.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI am very sorry about that. Please allow me to apologize on Father\u2019s behalf.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI know you\u2019ve already apologized to the boss, which is why I forgive you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThank you very much.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2026It seems that sometimes, the words of the dead are more powerful than those of the living.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>For a moment, Evileye glanced out of the carriage as she was deep in thought. Of course, that was just for a moment.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSpeaking of which, what is Brain Unglaus doing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWell, the Warrior-Captain told Brain that he hoped for Brain to succeed him as Warrior-Captain, but he felt that he was not up to the task. Therefore, he\u2019s looking for someone suitable to become the next Warrior-Captain and then he\u2019s going to train him up.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSo he\u2019s looking for someone who\u2019s not from a noble family\u2026 I see \u2015 after all, both Gazef and Brain were commoners. So he was thinking in that direction. And what you took away from that was\u2015\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2015That\u2019s right, to build the orphanage. Next time, I\u2019ll go visit the children with Brain-san. For all we know, there might be a talented child among them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWell, I\u2019m hardly that perceptive,\u201d Tina said. \u201cHow about you, Evileye?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou can\u2019t discern magical talent at a glance. At the very least, they\u2019ll need to go through a lot of magical training before I can roughly understand whether or not they can use magic. In addition, that\u2019s only for arcane magic. If those brats are talented at spiritualism or divine magic instead, I won\u2019t be able to see anything.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Renner went \u201cHmmmm~\u201d in a bothered tone, and then a smile blossomed on her face.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen, in future, I think we ought to invite all sorts of people to the orphanage and have them look over the children for talents.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Renner was looking at the two of them, apparently trying to convey something with her gaze. To some extent, it was more persuasive than actual speech.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2026That\u2019s pretty na\u00efve. But if it was her, ah\u2015\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Evileye, if it was our oni leader\u2015\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2015Yes. Still, I won\u2019t agree so easily, even if it\u2019s for her, no? After all, we need a certain amount of remuneration for this \u2015 since we\u2019ve been hired, we\u2019ll need a minimum payment. Besides, if we don\u2019t collect anything, it\u2019ll be bad for the others too. It\u2019ll also violate the adventurers\u2019 rules. In addition, a price has to be paid for teaching techniques.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWell, I do agree with everything you\u2019ve said, but I\u2019m very sorry. The truth is, I don\u2019t have any money\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Renner hung her head in dejection as she said that.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The Third Princess was a spare among spares, and nobody had any expectations of Renner besides her ability to join a noble family to the royal bloodline through marriage. Because of that, no nobles backed her, and she thus lacked any money of her own to spend as she wished. Of course, this was not much of a hardship for Renner, who lived a simple lifestyle. However, there was no way that the First or Second Princesses would be able to tolerate this sort of thing.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Because of that, Climb could keenly feel her intentions through the armor he wore.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019ve heard princesses all wear pretty dresses and lead graceful lives\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cReality\u2019s hardly that nice. Still, we can\u2019t say there aren\u2019t any princesses like that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>As he watched Princess Renner\u2019s eyes light up with admiration, an emotion which he could not express with words welled up within Climb\u2019s heart.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>How he wanted to give that sort of life to she who was both the most beautiful person in the world, and who had the most noble soul in the world.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>On the flip side, all this had been because of her. He was standing here now because she had saved him. Just then, Renner turned her face, and her sparkling eyes met Climb\u2019s own from the side. </span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2015Thinking of something, Climb?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAh, no, it\u2019s nothing, Renner-sama.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIs that so? Well, if you think of anything, you should speak up. We need to help each other in tough times, after all.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAh, yes! Thank you very much!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOi. Sorry to interrupt you lovebirds, but I really don\u2019t like handing down my skills for free. No matter what she says, I\u2019m still going to ask for an appropriate payment.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI will strive to meet your price.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Renner lowered her head.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHmm~ but what you want to know is whether they have talent or not, right, Hime-sama? If it\u2019s me, I can watch their movements, but how about you, Evileye?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAh, I\u2019ll level with you. You can\u2019t fathom a person\u2019s depths just by seeing them carry out a few exercises. Magical ability is more internal than external. In addition, I might seem like a genius when it comes to magical ability, but that\u2019s all there is. I don\u2019t have the abilities of that great magic caster from the Empire.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSo, identifying talents\u2015\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cTalents, huh,\u201d Renner sighed. \u201cIt would be a big help if we could identify them during childhood. It would also help soften the nobles\u2019 stubbornness toward the commoners too.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen, how about setting up a universal identification system for talents in children? There are 3rd-tier spells which can verify the presence or absence of a talent. However, if you want a full picture of what that talent might be, you\u2019d probably need a higher-tiered spell\u2026 well, in the end it\u2019s just an idle conjecture.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cReally? Can you really identify talents?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know what that sparkle in your eyes is for, but don\u2019t get your hopes up. I\u2019ve heard there\u2019s a 3rd-tier spiritualist-only spell which can verify if someone before the caster\u2019s eyes has a talent. That said, even if there was such a spell, the troublesome part would come after that. You\u2019d need to learn how to properly develop that talent. And it\u2019s also quite likely that after expressing that talent, it\u2019ll end up being a meaningless ability.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIs that so\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The light in Renner\u2019s eyes dimmed.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI think it would be better to test them in various ways. Have them stand under a waterfall, or have them inhale some relatively safe sleeping drugs to go into a trance. Apparently, it makes you sense your own natural talent, mixed up with something else. \u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cReally? \u2026Hm, is that really true?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAra, do you have a natural talent too, Evileye-san?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>At this, the hitherto chatty Evileye suddenly fell silent. It would seem someone had brought up a topic she did not want to discuss.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>However, his master was clueless enough to actually ask that question.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCould you tell me what kind of talent it is?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>It was not that she liked such incisive questioning, but the fact was, she tended to be this way. One might say she did not know how to read the flow of a conversation, or perhaps that she would unintentionally ask about things which were usually quite difficult to bring up.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Neither was it because she did not care about the other party; it was simply because she had grown up in the royal family.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat, are you getting excited over a question like this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThere are very few people with such talents around me, so I\u2019d like to know what sort of ability you have, Evileye-san.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIs that so. Well, since it\u2019s gotten to this, I might as well tell you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Evileye leaned her body forward, and Renner \u2015 her face a picture of excitement \u2015 leaned forward as well.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Natural talents could sometimes serve as a trump card, and this was even more so for adventurers. While he did not think Renner would go around blabbing out that secret, Climb felt that this was something which should not be shared lightly.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis isn\u2019t something I really want other people to hear, so could you bring your ear closer?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAll right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Renner brought her ear close to Evileye.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>And then\u2015</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAS IF I\u2019D GO AROUND BLABBING IMPORTANT THINGS LIKE THAT!!!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Her angry voice echoed through the carriage.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Tina seemed to have anticipated this, and had plugged her ears beforehand.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHow mean! My ears are ringing!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Renner threw herself into Climb\u2019s embrace. A suitable sound effect for this would be </span><i><span>pomf</span></i><span>.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>She looked up from his chest, her eyes brimming with tears.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Climb immediately cast aside such thoughts like \u201cShe\u2019s cute\u201d, \u201cShe smells nice\u201d and other meaningless things from his mind. It was forbidden to have such fantasies about one\u2019s mistress.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cEvileye-sama, I understand how you feel, but could I ask you to forgive\u2015\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2015Ah? Punk, she\u2019s become like this because you keep spoiling her, no?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt, it\u2019s nothing like that, I, it\u2019s not like I spoil the Princess or\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Even if he wanted to spoil her, there was no way he could do it.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes, I feel that Climb can and should spoil me more. I approve of what you said, Evileye-san.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo, no, that\u2019s not right, Princess-sama. It feels kind of wrong\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOf course not! If you spoil me more, I can take scoldings like that more easily. Therefore you must spoil me more. Let\u2019s start by napping together like we used to as children. Come, Evileye-san, please go on!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUgh, it\u2019s fine. I\u2019m such an idiot\u2026 In any case, I don\u2019t intend to go around telling others my talent, kid. Got it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIs it really that dangerous?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAh, yes. It\u2019s my ace in the hole. If I use it\u2026 yes, it would be like if our leader\u2019s sword went berserk. It could easily annihilate an entire city.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>There seemed to be a terrible weight in Evileye\u2019s voice as she said this. </span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Still, a baffled \u201cHm?\u201d made its way up from his chest. He wanted to look down, but if he did, it would make him very aware of the reality that Renner was very close to him. There was no way he could do that.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>He thought about pushing Renner away, but after taking her soft and fragile body into consideration, he did not know how much force he should use.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>As Climb\u2019s heart continued pounding, the conversation continued without him.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe sword Lakyus carries?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAh, according to her, once it goes wild, it\u2019ll lead to grave consequences. A city, no, a nation, was it? Apparently it\u2019ll be completely wiped out. She did say something about having to use use part of her strength to suppress it\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSo that\u2019s what was going on\u2026 I didn\u2019t know about that\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Climb had not told his mistress about that demonic sword yet.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s best not to mind it. Our oni leader didn\u2019t mention it to the two of you because she didn\u2019t want you to worry. I\u2019d be glad if you continued pretending like you didn\u2019t know.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2026I see. I understand. Then I\u2019ll do as you say.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSpeaking of which, what happened to Aindra-sama? I haven\u2019t seen her around recently\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHm? I don\u2019t think anyone mentioned it, right? Princess, didn\u2019t you tell him?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2026I forgot. It seems like she\u2019s training with Gagaran-san and Tia-san.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Evileye took up the verbal baton from Renner and continued.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe two of them lost their lives during the battle with Jaldabaoth, the Demon Lord who attacked the Kingdom. Of course, they were resurrected after that, but it expended a large amount of their lifeforce. Thus, they need to place themselves in danger, treading the edge of life and death in order to regain their strength.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIn truth, I wish I could have gone with them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cStill, if you did that, you\u2019d begin to depend on that method somewhere in your heart. The best path to strength is through a small amount of short battles.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI doubt that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUmu, it does seem like the an effective way to \u201clair-bellup\u201d (level up)\u2026 Well, if you don\u2019t rely on that method, you might not even be able to stall for time when that fellow attacks the Royal Capital again.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cStall for time? Ahh \u2015 time for that person you recommended, Evileye?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOf course! Until that hero-sama can arrive!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Evileye\u2019s mood seemed to have suddenly changed.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>One could clearly feel her passion and excitement through that mask of hers.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s Momon\u2015sa\u2015sama, right?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s right! The great hero, Momon-sama! The mightiest warrior ever, who swings his twin greatswords like they were little more than twigs! There\u2019s no doubt that he\u2019s the strongest fighter in the land! Even if Jaldabaoth comes again, as long as Momon-sama is around, he\u2019ll definitely slaughter him! Although, it was a shame that he managed to escape last time. Still, that great man should have come up with some way to deal with that by now!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Overwhelmed by the ardor of her words, all Climb could do was weakly answer, \u201cAh, yes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBut will that person really come? Isn\u2019t he a minion of that Sorcerer King?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Tina\u2019s expression suggested she was thoroughly exhausted as she spoke out to Evileye, who had her fists clenched.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAhhhh~ Momon-sama! Shit, that damn Sorcerer King! To think he would actually dare to take control of that great man! Even if Heaven permits it, I won\u2019t! If only I could defeat him and free Momon-sama! What on earth was he thinking, anyway? Maybe I should go to E-Rantel and ask Momon-sama about his thoughts, how about that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2026That will have to wait for after the two of them recover.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019ll just pop over for a bit, and once I familiarize myself with the place I can just teleport back. Plus, if I use [Fly] and travel by myself, it won\u2019t take much time!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cEvileye, you really do break down once it comes to Momon\u2026 Didn\u2019t our oni leader say you can\u2019t do that sort of thing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSo help me keep it a secret!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWell, my lips are pret~ty loose, so they\u2019ll reveal everything in an instant.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOi, that would be impossible given your prior vocation, right?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAlas, I am now Tina of \u201cBlue Rose\u201d, also known as \u2018Can\u2019t Keep A Secret To Save Her Life\u2019.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>It was then that Tina\u2019s eyes took on a serious gleam.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2026Hm, this is a good opportunity. I\u2019ve been wanting to ask you, Evileye \u2015 can you kill the Sorcerer King?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Evileye froze. Her excitement drained away in an instant. In its place was the highest-levelled magic caster among adventurers.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIf those rumors are all true \u2015 then he is more powerful than any other magic caster. I did some investigations after the incident at the Katze Plains and looked up all my contacts \u2015 I even got in touch with that granny \u2015 and then analyzed the information I obtained. However, it\u2019s so ridiculous it\u2019s not even funny any more. It\u2019s absurd to the point where I was seriously suspecting if the punk was mesmerized by an illusion.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat was definitely not an illusion. And there were so many dead\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Renner\u2019s face twisted in agony.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOf the 260,000 people who took part in that war, 180,000 of them lost their lives. I\u2019ve also heard that there are survivors who were mentally scarred and can\u2019t live a normal life any more. Some of the orphans had fathers who ended up like that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2026Well, after listening to the punk, I can see how they\u2019d end up like that. If they were chased by such monsters\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2026Yes. It was hell. Fortunately, I had Brain-san\u2026 and the Warrior-Captain with me, and thanks to those two strong men, I didn\u2019t suffer any mental wounds. Even so, sometimes I reflexively find myself wanting to look back over my shoulder. It must have been worse for the peasant levies, and it wouldn\u2019t be strange for them to become mentally ill as a result.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou really need to thank your luck for that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Climb could only nod in response.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen, Tina. Let me answer your question honestly. I cannot defeat the Sorcerer King.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>That was the answer she had expected.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAs I thought\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWell, yes. I might be able to think of a way to deal with those monsters he summoned. Granted, it\u2019s hard to say that, given that I was not at the scene. Still, the Sorcerer King \u2015 who can not only summon multiple monsters of that kind and control them \u2015 is a being that should not exist in this world. Someone like that possesses the power of the gods.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIs it possible that they could have been summoned from an item, and not from the Sorcerer King\u2019s power?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe possibility does exist, but if that was the case, it would also be very dangerous. That said, we have no way of verifying that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIf only he would end up coming into conflict with Jaldabaoth.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s a development we\u2019re all looking forward to. After that, the best-case scenario would be Momon-sama slaying the Sorcerer King\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2026\u2026\u300d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWho do you think is stronger, between Momon-sama and the Sorcerer King?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The person who asked this question was Climb, but personally, he felt that the Sorcerer King that had summoned those powerful monsters was far superior. Yet, Evileye\u2019s pensive expression shocked him.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. Personally, I feel that Momon-sama \u2015 who drove off that Jaldabaoth \u2015 is stronger. But the Sorcerer King also possesses unimaginable might. Both sides are far superior to us, to the point where I can\u2019t even picture the outcome.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cStill, having someone like him under the banner of the Sorcerer King is pretty much the worst-case scenario. Nobody would dare declare war on him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Indeed.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The only person who might be able to take the Sorcerer King on even terms had instead become his vassal. That was a truly troubling development. Anyone who declared war on the Sorcerer King would effectively be declaring war on two Sorcerer Kings.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Just as the mood in the carriage grew grim, there was a knocking on the board which separated the passenger compartment of the coach from the driver\u2019s seat, and then it opened.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWe\u2019ll be reaching the Royal Palace soon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>As she heard the driver\u2019s words, Renner slowly rose to her feet, and locked eyes with the two adventurers seated before her.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cToday, I have received your care in various ways. When Lakyus returns, I will thank her properly. May I ask if you have time to dine with me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u2666 \u2666 \u2666</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>After the report of his younger sister\u2019s return reached him, the Second Prince \u2015 </span><span>Zanack Valreon Igana Ryle Vaiself \u2015 departed his chambers to welcome her home.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The location of his elder brother \u2015 </span><span>Barbro Andrean Ield Ryle Vaiself \u2015 was still unknown. Given that a long time had passed, his chances of survival were considered extremely small. That being the case, Zanack was effectively the heir to the throne. Thus, the way in which he went to receive his younger sister was entirely inappropriate. While they were siblings, there was a clear distinction in their respective stations.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The reason why he had chosen to go in person despite knowing that fact was because he had a proposal he urgently wanted to discuss with her. Zanack might not have been entirely willing to do so, but he had lost his closest confidant and thus had nobody else to turn to.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Soon, his younger sister appeared before him.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Climb \u2015 clad in his pure white armor \u2015 was close by. Wherever Renner went, Climb often followed her. This too was nothing out of the ordinary.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The pauper\u2019s child that Renner had picked off the streets \u2015 Climb.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>In the past, he had thought she must have gotten a bee in her bonnet and picked him up out of a moment\u2019s fancy. However, after he came to understand Renner\u2019s strange personality and her incomparable intellect, Zanack began to think she might have had a reason for doing so.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>And then, after Jaldabaoth assaulted the Royal Capital, and the Sorcerer King wrought his grand massacre, he slowly began to understand the meaning behind her actions.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>There were very few warriors in this city who were stronger than Climb. Even among the men of Gazef\u2019s hand-picked warrior band, one could count the number of people who were stronger than Climb on one hand.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>In addition, there was the man called Brain Unglaus, who had come with Climb, as well as her close friendship with Lakyus, the leader of the adamantite-ranked adventurer party called \u201cBlue Rose\u201d. There was no doubt that his younger sister now possessed the most physical power in the Royal Capital.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u2015Was she really not conspiring to overthrow him with military force?</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Zanack was right to suspect her of doing so.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Even if Renner was not one to resort to such measures so easily, one still had to take precautions. Therefore, Zanack had begun to secretly build ties with orichalcum and mithril-ranked adventurers.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Zanack quietly thanked his elder brother.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The reason why he could work so hard on these matters was because his brother had gone missing and had virtually left him the throne. Another big reason was because his brother\u2019s stipend now went to him.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>That said, the fact that Crown Prince Barbro\u2019s corpse had not yet been found left a hint of unease in his heart. It would be very troublesome if he had been imprisoned by the Sorcerer King or was hiding in a village somewhere while recovering from his wounds.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cReally\u2026 Is he going to give me trouble right until the end?\u201d Zanack muttered, quietly enough so that the members of his retinue could not hear.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>He had to avoid agitating the nobles before he consolidated his position.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Currently, Zanack\u2019s backing was still not very secure.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Marquis Raeven \u2015 who had joined with him to revitalize the Kingdom \u2015 had thrown off Zanack\u2019s hand as he reached out to pull him back, and returned to his own lands. It could not be helped, as he had lost many people from his demesne, but at that time, there had been an air around him which seemed to say that he would never be coming back again.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Part of the reason for that must have been the deaths of his formerly orichalcum-ranked adventurer team and that of his peasant-turned-strategist, a man who Raeven considered a treasure.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Zanack felt a slight pain pricking at his gut. Could discussing matters with his younger sister soothe that pain?</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>He had been agonizing over a certain problem for the past few weeks.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>That was \u2015 should he offer a tribute to the Sorcerer King? If he did so, should he send them in the name of celebrating the founding of his nation? Or should he do so for another reason?</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Judging by the current circumstances, not sending the gift would be the right choice. Why would anyone send a gift to someone who had taken one\u2019s own territory and founded a nation on it? The surrounding countries would surely take it as a mark of vassalage. That said, it was crucial to remain on the best of terms with the Sorcerous Kingdom.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Though the Sorcerous Kingdom\u2019s fighting strength remained unknown, the fact that the Sorcerer King could destroy a nation by himself was common knowledge.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>No matter what, he had to avert the possibility of that man\u2019s eye turning to the Kingdom once more.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Because of that, he had to send a gift. Zanack felt that it could not be helped, even if other nations believed it to be a sign of fealty. No matter what, he had to buy as much time as possible.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>However, the nobles would never accept that. This was the troublesome part.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The Sorcerer King\u2019s might was widely known. That said, there was no way they would accept an attitude of submission from the future ruler of the Kingdom (Zanack), even in the face of that strength.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The nobles had suffered tremendous losses, so they were looking for scapegoats upon which to vent their frustration.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Due to the loss of his confidant Gazef Stronoff, the current King, Ranpossa III, was overcome with grief and despair, and had fallen into a state of extreme mental distress. To some extent, seeing the King in this sad state had mollified the nobles\u2019 anger, but their hatred toward their broken King \u2015 and perhaps the entire royal family \u2015 would not vanish so easily.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i><span>If that fellow was around, he\u2019d probably be able to come up with something good</span></i><span>.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>If possible, he would have like to have come to a conclusion himself. However, time was tight, and he needed a plan for action soon. </span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Zanack stood in place, while stomping his boots loudly.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Renner reacted to the sound, and turned to look at him. Then, she changed her direction and headed toward Zanack. That way, Zanack\u2019s dignity as one of higher rank would remain intact.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Soon, his younger sister stood before him, but Zanack did not speak first. Moments like this were very delicate. He had to let more people understand who exactly was on top here.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019ve returned, Onii-sama.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWelcome back, my sister.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>In the face of Renner\u2019s respectful greeting, Zanack responded with equal generosity. He saw Climb saluting from the corner of his eye, but there was no need to return the salute of a mere soldier.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cLet us walk together.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt would be my pleasure, Onii-sama.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Zanack and Renner set out together, side by side. He raised his chin, indicating that his retinue should keep their distance. If he had looked over, he would have seen Renner gesturing to Climb that he was permitted to stay further away.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSpeaking of which, Onii-sama, you seem quite worried. What has happened?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Renner smiled as she gently asked her question.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCould it be that the Sorcerous Kingdom has sent an envoy over?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Zanack could distinctly hear his heart thump in his chest. He had been too focused on what action to take on his part, and had completely overlooked the fact that they might try to initiate contact with him.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>In other words, Renner felt that it was about time for the other side to take action.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Zanack made a mental note of that, and shook his head.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat is to say, you came all this way to see me for some other reason?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAhh. I was pondering the problem of tribute.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI think that once their emissary arrives, it would be better for you to offer twice as much as what you are currently imagining, Onii-sama. Half of that is a token of thanks for their coming all this way, while the other half \u2015 I trust that goes without saying?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Zanack did not say anything, but carefully reviewed Renner\u2019s proposal.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Indeed, it was a very good move.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Surely none of the nobles would object to presenting a gift to a guest who had come to their home, even if there were ulterior motives for doing so.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The fact that Renner had instantly solved a problem which had been troubling him for a long time once more struck fear into Zanack\u2019s heart. In addition, as long as Renner possessed her powerful subordinates, even assassination would not be effective. That being the case, his only option was to try and appease her.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2026When I become the King, I will grant you land on the border. You will proceed there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI understand. I shall obey any orders that you give me, Onii-sama.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAfter I send you out, I will not summon you to the Royal Capital again. It might somewhat limit your freedom, but I will choose a domain which ensures you do not suffer hardship. You should spend the rest of your life there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI see. My deepest thanks.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>In all likelihood, Renner already understood what he was aiming for, but he had to actually vocalize it in order to let her understand the kindness he was showing to her.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou may take any of the orphans to be your children. In that respect you may do as you please.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThank you very much, Onii-sama.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The fact that she replied without a delay was evidence that Renner already knew what Zanack was going to say.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Zanack could not understand why Renner loved Climb the commoner. His looks were very plain, and he was not particularly special. He did not seem to match his little sister at all.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i><span>Ahh, come to think of it, I heard of her fetish back then.</span></i></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Once he recalled that shameful memory of his little sister, Zanack began to feel a little sorry for Climb.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen, I do look forward to the day you will become King, Onii-sama. After your coronation, I would be happy if you would think of me from time to time as I live on a farm.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOhh, I shall, my dear sister. However, it would be best if I could look you up for a discussion from time to time \u2015 muu?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Zanack turned his gaze to the soldier that was jogging over to them.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>That man was one of the surviving members of Gazef\u2019s warrior band.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>He had fought to protect the King on that battlefield. Now that the Warrior-Captain was gone, he had a good position and the trust of the King. Incidentally, Renner\u2019s two subordinates enjoyed that same trust.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The mental image of his father\u2019s withered frame appeared before his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cMy Prince, His Majesty desires your presence.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The instant he finished that, he turned to look at Renner.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHe requests your presence as well, my Princess.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWe have just received a report that the Sorcerer King will be sending a diplomatic party to call on us soon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Zanack snuck a look at Renner, but still managed to answer the man.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI understand. Notify him that we will be arriving shortly. My sister, I will be proceeding first. Please proceed with all haste once you are ready.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI understand, Onii-sama.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Given that she had been at the orphanage until recently, Renner\u2019s clothes were plain and weathered. Appearing like that before the nobles would only embarrass herself.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>With that, Zanack stalked off with a stern expression on his face.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHmph. Things being as they are, that proposal is no longer appealing. Ah, it\u2019s too late, after all.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><b>Part 2</b></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>It was estimated that the envoys of the Sorcerous Kingdom would take about a week to travel from E-Rantel to the Royal Capital.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Today was the seventh day. If all went according to plan, the envoys would reach the Royal Capital today.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Zanack, dressed in armor that he was not accustomed to, stood in line with his knights at the gates of the Royal Capital which faced E-Rantel.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The cloudy weather of the past few days had cleared up, like it had all been a joke, and the sky was the very picture of spring.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>However, one could see heavy cloud cover in the distance. It would seem the azure sky was limited to the air directly above the Royal Capital.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>This sort of scenery was quite bizarre. In fact, the Royal Capital\u2019s meteorologist had shouted, \u201cThis is impossible!\u201d as he scratched his head.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>He had been working in the Royal Palace for a long time now, and he could predict the next day\u2019s weather with over 90% accuracy. Thus, when he declared that this was impossible, it implied that these blue skies were anything but natural.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Zanack sighed deeply under his helmet.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>He had never heard of weather-controlling magic from his teachers. However, that Sorcerer King might well be able to use such magic with contemptuous ease.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Zanack\u2019s men were not only unskilled in the area of magic, but they lacked any knowledge of other strange phenomena. This made his head ache. More accurately, it was because he had relied too heavily on Marquis Raeven.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>He had gathered the knowledge from his adventurers, compiled it, and called it the Tiger Scroll. It contained information on various kinds and appearances of magic items, the types and powers of various monsters, all sorts of spells, and so on.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Until now, he had freely shared that scroll with Zanack, his ally. However, since Raeven was no longer in the Royal Capital, the Tiger Scroll was naturally gone with him.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>He had tried to find nobles who had learned from adventurers, like Raeven had, but sadly, there were none. This was not because these nobles were stupid, but because they lived in a completely different world from those adventurers. While some nobles did hire adventurers, it was merely to make use of their strength. The nobles were not interested in the adventuring world or the news which adventurers had.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The nobles had been that way throughout the Kingdom\u2019s 200 years of history. From that point of view, Raeven was quite atypical.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i><span>It\u2019s probably hard to find retired adventurers \u2015 especially those of mithril rank and above.</span></i></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>He heard that adventurers hated troublesome things like politics. Indeed, once one entered the world of politics, one would lose one\u2019s freedom. Would adventurers like that want to work for him after retiring?</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Zanack\u2019s heart sank as he thought about that.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2015My Prince!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The shout of the knight next to him brought Zanack back to his senses. He looked to the end of the street \u2015 and saw it.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>He could begin to make out the Sorcerous Kingdom\u2019s envoys.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>They had exerted pressure beforehand to shut this street down for today, closing it to traffic. As a result, nobody would be popping out of doors behind them. The city gates had also been locked down just for today.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAll right, let\u2019s go over this again. We are to treat them like foreign dignitaries. Trying anything on the envoys of the Sorcerous Kingdom is a grave offense. It will be punished by summary execution.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSir!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The reply of the ranked knights was quite forceful, and the swords at their waists made a clear, crisp and unified sound.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAll right! Then, show them the utmost respect, and impress the glory of the Kingdom upon them!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSir!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The group remained absolutely still until the envoys had arrived.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Before long, the envoys\u2019 vanguard reached them.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>It was a black-armored knight. It rode a red-eyed unicorn that had a jet black body and sported two horns on its head. One could imagine that the rider was not human either. It emanated an aura of mortal danger, as radiant as the sun. Its full plate armor pulsed as if it was alive.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Zanack could feel his warhorse trembling in fear beneath him.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>It clenched its clawed gauntlet and thumped its chest.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cApologies! We are the envoys of the Sorcerous Kingdom of Ainz Ooal Gown!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>One might compare that voice to music squeezed out of rotted instruments. It made its listeners\u2019 hair stand on end just by hearing it. Zanack gathered up his courage to banish his fear, and then he spoke.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI am the Second Prince of the Kingdom of Re-Estize, Zanack Valreon Igana Ryle Vaiself! By His Majesty\u2019s order, I am to guide your party to the Royal Palace. Please follow behind us!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAcknowledged. Then, we shall avail ourselves of your guidance. This one \u2015 forgive me, this one does not bear a name, so please allow this one to introduce itself by the name of its species. This one is a Death Cavalier!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Zanack gawked a little when it had given the name of its species, but he responded immediately so as not to give offense through his delay.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen, may I address you as Cavalier-dono?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis one would be honored to be addressed in that manner.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI see. Then, may I greet the leader of the envoys? As the Second Prince, I am also responsible for said leader\u2019s actions within the Kingdom. If possible, I would like to explain the circumstances to your leader.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAcknowledged. This one shall convey your message to our leader-dono.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou have my deepest thanks.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>With that, the outrider retreated to deliver his report.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>While the whole process sounded quite laughable at times, he was facing up against the Sorcerous Kingdom, after all. It was a nation that could control the undead and make use of monsters, so it would be best to assume that the usual ways of doing things were inapplicable here. He felt stupid for even expecting the leader of the envoys to have a vaguely human shape.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNow then, stiff upper lips, everyone. We cannot afford to do anything that would offend them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSir!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>As he heard the knights\u2019 response, Zanack poured strength into his belly.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The envoys had passed through several towns on the way here, which was how Zanack knew of the party\u2019s composition.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>There were five coaches.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Each of them was pulled by a horse-shaped monster that radiated an inauspicious air. Then, there were numerous Death Cavaliers, who had been tasked with perimeter security. There were also other monsters beside them.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Zanack was unclear on the names of those monsters or how dangerous they were. Still, whether he knew them or not, his duties remained unchanged. Since they were envoys dispatched by the Sorcerer King, he could not possibly allow any slight to be shown to them.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>A Death Cavalier \u2015 probably the same one from just now \u2015 approached him from the envoys\u2019 side.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cForgive the long wait. Our leader \u2015 the right hand of the Sorcerer King Ainz Ooal Gown, Albedo-sama, has agreed to meet with you. Zanack-dono, please, proceed this way.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>After signalling to the other knights to hold their position, Zanack guided his horse after the Death Cavalier.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>In all honesty, it was quite terrifying.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>After all, Zanack was moving amongst monsters he had never seen before.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Even so, he still had his pride as a member of the Royal Family. Zanack would soon be the King, and since he would have to meet with emissaries of the Sorcerer King, he was forbidden to disgrace himself. Instead, he had to demonstrate his ability at this time, and let them take home news of the talented people in the Re-Estize Kingdom.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Zanack\u2019s horse could not keep itself from breaking out into a cold sweat as it approached the coach. Zanack dismounted, standing before the coach.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen, this is the leader of the envoy party, Albedo-sama.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i><span>What sort of monster is going to show up next?</span></i><span> Zanack willed his expression not to change.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The door slowly opened, and a human figure slowly emerged.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>What he saw there \u2015 was beautiful.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>No, Zanack could not think of an adjective that could better describe her. The only thing which came to mind was \u201cworld-class beauty\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i><span>Nobody in this world could possibly possess looks comparable to Renner\u2019s</span></i><span>. Zanack had believed this until now, but then he realised that was mistaken. If Renner\u2019s was a radiant beauty, then Albedo\u2019s was a seductive beauty tinged in darkness.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Albedo trod on the stepboard of the coach. The faint sound of her high heels jolted Zanack back to reality.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Zanack immediately genuflected before her and lowered his head.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>One might think that it was embarrassing for a prince of a royal family to kneel before anyone, even if they were an emissary from another nation. However, after considering the difference in power between the Kingdom and the Sorcerous Kingdom, this was the right course of action. What the Kingdom needed now was not glory, but concrete benefits.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCould you please raise your head?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The quiet, lovely voice rang out from above him.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAt once.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>As he looked up, the fair maiden\u2019s face was all smiles as she tenderly looked down on him.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>This was a practiced attitude which superior men would adopt \u2015 no, was she even human?</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Zanack moved his eyes to size her up. First, were the wings on her waist magic items, or something else? Similarly, the horns curling out from the sides of her head.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Whether they were magic items or if she was actually a heteromorphic creature, neither of them seemed particularly bizarre once he considered that she hailed from the Sorcerous Kingdom.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI am the envoy of the Sorcerous Kingdom of Ainz Ooal Gown, Albedo. Though it is but for a few days, we will be imposing upon you. Rise, Prince-dono. You certainly cannot continue speaking as you kneel.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou have my deepest thanks.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Zanack straightened up, and then a problem presented itself.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Though he had learned her name was Albedo through conversation, was that really all?</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>In the Kingdom \u2015 and in the Empire \u2015 commoners had two names, nobles had three names, and titled people had four names. For the royal family, they had four names \u2015 plus their titles for a total of five names.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>This was why Jircniv Rune Farlord El-Nix and his four names were mocked for not being an actual member of royalty. However, a name like Albedo sounded like an alias, or a nickname. One could not possibly be as foolish as to address a member of the nobility by such a moniker.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Though he might have been worrying needlessly, he could not be sure that such a situation would not occur.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The reason why he said this was because many nobles had died in the previous battlefield. It was not just family heads who perished, but even the firstborn heirs of some families. Currently, many noble families were led by the \u201cspares\u201d, the second or third sons.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Spares were spares. Nobody expected much of those nobles. Not only did they lack class, but they lacked knowledge as well. In short, they lacked the appropriate upbringing.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Under normal circumstances, they would have been properly educated by the higher-ups in their faction, but the previous war meant that they no longer had the manpower for such efforts. As a result, many incompetent people were forced onto the center stage, and these incompetent people gathered together to form a faction of incompetents.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Currently, the class of the Kingdom\u2019s nobility had plummeted, thanks to these people. At this crucial moment, could they meet a woman like Albedo with adequate etiquette?</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2026Forgive me, but may I know how I should properly address you, Albedo-sama?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>This was a somewhat disrespectful question. </span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Normally, he should have asked. \u201cWhat title do you hold among the peerage, Albedo-sama, or perhaps what is your position in the Sorcerous Kingdom?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The problem was, she might have shot back, \u201cDo you not even know the rank of an emissary from your neighboring country?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Still, that was the fault of the Sorcerous Kingdom.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>After all, no information about the Sorcerous Kingdom had flowed out from its borders. Though it had declared its own sovereignty for several months now, they had largely restricted themselves to internal affairs. This was the first time they had engaged in diplomatic relations of their own accord.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>All Zanack knew about Albedo was that she was the leader of the envoys, and the hand of the Sorcerer King.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i><span>The Empire would probably know\u2026 but they didn\u2019t tell us anything\u2026 Well, anyone who would have asked for that sort of spell to be used on us must hate us to the bone.</span></i></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>As though sensing his worries, Albedo answered:</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThough it may not appear that way, I have been appointed as the supervisor who leads all the Floor Guardians and Area Guardians within the Sorcerous Kingdom of Ainz Ooal Gown.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOhh, I see.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>He said that, but he had no idea what being the \u201csupervisor\u201d meant. In addition, he was completely clueless regarding the \u201cFloors\u201d of which she spoke.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Albedo continued speaking, having seemingly seen through his concealed confusion:</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIndeed. I am Ainz-sama\u2019s \u2015 no, I should say, I am the Sorcerer King\u2019s second-in-command, the Guardian Overseer . Perhaps that would be more appropriate?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOhhh, I see now!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Ainz-sama, it looks like she\u2019s close enough to address him in that manner. So she\u2019s a marchioness, no, a duchess, perhaps? I need to get this information back to the others. But still, Guardian\u2026 Overseer?</span></i></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen, Albedo-sama, permit me to escort you to the Royal Palace. There are suites in the Royal Capital where I pray you will take residence for the time being. My father \u2015 King Ranpossa III is of advanced age, so he assigned me the task of meeting you at the gates of the Capital. I pray you will forgive us this slight.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is fine.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Her smile had not changed at all.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Normally, she should have been thanking the Prince. However, he could clearly sense who was the superior party from her attitude.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Zanack was gushing cold sweat from his back. This was because he understood that forging good relations with them would probably be a very difficult task.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2026In addition, we would normally ring the bells in celebration, but the unfortunate misunderstanding between our countries led to tragedy, so please forgive us for not doing so. In addition, the common folk do not yet know of your arrival, so please take that into consideration.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOf course, it is not a problem.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>He had no idea what would the people would do if they knew that an emissary of the Sorcerer King had come to call on them. In that respect, Albedo\u2019s answer was a great relief.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i><span>Is it better to think that I owe her a favor?</span></i></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>He was not at all worried that the envoys would be attacked by an angry mob. Those Death Cavaliers \u2015 indeed, everyone present was probably very strong, even within the Sorcerous Kingdom. He could easily believe that each of them was a match for that Gazef Stronoff.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen, may I ask a few questions of my own?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOf course! I will answer as long as it is in my power to do so.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWell then, could you tell me of the itinerary after we reach the Royal Palace?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes! First, there is a dinner scheduled with myself and the rest of the Royal Family tonight. Tomorrow, we will visit the theaters in the day to watch the dances and hold a dinner party at night, where all the nobles of the Kingdom will be invited. The day after that will feature a concert by the Palace\u2019s orchestra \u2015 after which we will begin the diplomatic negotiations.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSo that\u2019s how it is\u2026 then, I trust there will be no issues if we decide to freely tour the capital?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOf course. We shall select exceptional knights to serve as your guards.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Although the word itself meant that the knights would defend them, it also implied observation, and even to restrain them if the need arose.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cMay I know if any place interests you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>They would need to completely lock down the area on that day, to make it impossible for commoners to go near that place.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo\u2026 there are no places which particularly interest me. Since I do not know which locations are worth visiting in the capital, could you guide me on a tour?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUnderstood. I shall make the appropriate preparations.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Albedo smiled as she nodded.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><b>Part 3</b></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>For the past month or so, Philip felt that he was one of the luckiest men in the Kingdom.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>He was arguably the luckiest of such men, if he did say so himself. However, modesty was a virtue. Besides, there might be other nobles luckier than himself, so it would be best not to speak in absolutes.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i><span>Nobles \u2015 huh.</span></i></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Philip tightened up his smile while smoothing out his clothes.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>This was only the second time he had participated in a noble party like this. Still, perhaps he should say that this was expected of a dinner party organized by the Royal Family \u2015 the sheer decadence of this event outshone the one he had previously attended.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The formal attire of the other guests seemed much more costly than the ones at the earlier party. How much did their outfits cost, anyway? Philip glanced at his own clothes, and began to feel a little frustrated.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>As he thought, the upper-class nobles had really awesome clothes.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The noblewomen in their fancy dresses all had smiles on their faces, but were those smiles mocking him for his plain attire? Philip could not help but think that way, even without any basis for such assumptions. When he looked around, he imagined all the surrounding nobles laughing at him.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i><span>It\u2019s all because I have no money.</span></i></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>If his domain was wealthier, he would have been able to afford better clothes. However, Philip\u2019s domain had never been that prosperous to begin with. Even his clothes now had been hastily stitched together from his older brother\u2019s formal wear. As a result, they still felt a little tight around the shoulders.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i><span>Well, money\u2019s scarce because the family heads until now were useless. So once I become the next head, I\u2019ll make my domain wealthier.</span></i></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Philip was born the third son of a noble family.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Similar to commoners, third sons were not individuals who were particularly welcome in noble families. No matter how rich a family was, splitting its assets multiple ways would ultimately weaken it. Therefore, it was all inherited by the eldest son. In this respect, the nobles followed the same basic principle as the commoners.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Perhaps a wealthier family might have been able to give a third son some financial support. Perhaps they could count on connections to other noble families and foster him out. However, this was not the case for Philip\u2019s family.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Once the eldest son came of age \u2015 in other words, when the chances of him dying of disease were greatly decreased \u2015 the third son Philip was no longer necessary to his family.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Would he be given a bit of money and then chased out of the family home? Or perhaps he would be sent to live with a poor family and work like a peasant. He could only see tragedy waiting in both options. Yet, things had not unfolded that way. Instead, he was making his debut at a grand society ball.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>That was why Philip felt he was lucky.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The first bit of luck was his elder brother, the second son, dying of illness before he came of age.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Since his eldest brother \u2015 the first son \u2015 was already a man by then, there was no longer any value to his elder brother, the second son. In addition, theirs was not a wealthy fief, and they could only use herbs instead of priests to treat him. In the end, his condition had taken a turn for the worse, and he shuffled off the mortal coil.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>At this point, Philip was now elevated to the position of a spare. His value had risen from that of a farmer to that of a butler.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Things like these were not uncommon.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>However, what had catapulted Philip into the upper crust was the result of Philip\u2019s next stroke of luck.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Several years after reaching adulthood, it was time for Philip\u2019s elder brother to take over the family estate. Then, that war with the Empire had broken out. If it had been like previous years, it should have ended after a few bumps and scrapes. Therefore, it was a safe way for his elder brother to obtain a battle record, and his family could take pride in the fact that they had pledged men to the battle.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>However, his elder brother had not come back.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>He had been consumed by the Sorcerer King\u2019s magic, and perished with the twenty peasants that went with him.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Philip could not forget the instant of joy he felt when he heard that news. It was the joy he had carried within him ever since becoming a spare.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>His elder brother\u2019s body was missing, and so was the suit of full plate armor passed down from his ancestors. Still, that was not a big problem. Once his domain grew wealthier, he would make a better suit of armor for himself. The more important thing was that the title of estate heir had gone from unattainable to practically his.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The timing for that was perfect.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>If his brother had died after inheriting the family estate, Philip would have had to spend his time waiting for his nephew to grow into a man. However, since his brother had died without claiming his inheritance, his lordship was a done deal.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>It was as though the Sorcerer King had gone out of his way to arrange all this for Philip.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Because of that, Philip even felt something like goodwill toward the Sorcerer King that he had never met before. If only he could convey his gratitude directly to the Sorcerer King\u2019s emissary.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>In addition\u2015</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i><span>That\u2019s right. I\u2019m going to ride on my streak of luck. How can I let such a good chance get away before my eyes?</span></i></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Philip\u2019s heart blazed like a bonfire.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>He could only think of his father and elder brother as idiots after seeing what they had been doing all this time. </span><i><span>Why don\u2019t you do this? Doesn\u2019t this bring you more benefits?</span></i><span> Of course, he never told them that to their faces.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>That was because none of the gains made would trickle down to him. Neither would any prestige for doing so be his. Therefore, over a long time, Philip had cooked up ideas on how to properly administer his fief and stored them in his heart.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i><span>I will let the nearby lords know that I am the one who deserves this title. I will let Father know how poor his taste was in choosing Nii-san. Selling the good-quality wheat and vegetables to those traders \u2015 no, what should I do? That would draw too much attention, and what if my revolutionary proposal was stolen by others? Still, there\u2019s no money without trade. I need to find tight-lipped and reliable merchants \u2015 in other words, not that guy.</span></i></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Philip\u2019s face twisted as he recalled the face of that merchant.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The unpleasant memory of that man overcame his joy at being able to stand in this lavish hall.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i><span>How dare he look down on me! Although I have to bear it for now, once I find a better merchant in the Royal Capital, I\u2019ll boot him away! I\u2019ve already got connections of my own!</span></i></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Philip had already found his own underground connections during his few weeks in the Royal Capital. His pride at this chased away the unhappiness in his heart.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i><span>As expected of me, I\u2019ve already got my path all mapped out. I\u2019ll make my domain rich and obtain a huge fortune. Those idiots who looked down on me will see who\u2019s the true idiot now.</span></i></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Just as Philip was envisioning his glorious golden future, a male voice rang through the hall.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cLadies and gentlemen! I present to you the leader of the envoys from the Sorcerous Kingdom, Albedo-sama!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>At this moment, the grand hall\u2019s orchestra lowered their instruments, and the mood of joviality in the air died down.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Judging by the noises, it would seem the master of ceremonies had just announced the star of the dinner party which the Royal Family was hosting. </span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAlbedo-sama serves as the right hand of the His Majesty the Sorcerer King in the Sorcerous Kingdom, and commands a position equivalent to that of a prime minister as a Guardian Overseer. Albedo-sama will grace us alone this evening.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>A soft woman\u2019s voice said, \u201cHuh, alone?\u201d. A wealthy-looking noble standing nearby chastised her with a \u201cQuiet, you.\u201d Philip felt a little surprised at this.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i><span>Coming by oneself is all well and good. But to think someone like that would serve as an emissary! Does the Sorcerous Kingdom truly have such high hopes for the Kingdom?</span></i></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>As Philip wondered what sort of man this emissary would turn out to be, he looked toward the doors by which the master of ceremonies was standing.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen, let us welcome the leader of the envoys, Albedo-sama!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>As the great doors opened, the entire hall fell silent.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>A goddess-like woman stood there. Her perfect features were more beautiful than any peasant, more beautiful than any whore in the Kingdom\u2019s brothels, more beautiful than any woman Philip had ever seen in his life. Of course, the Princess from earlier was pretty, but Philip preferred what he was seeing now.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Her clothes were beautiful as well. Her platinum dress was accented with golden hair ornaments, while the lower half of her dress was covered by what seemed like black feathered wings. Her reflection in the magical lights above made it seem as though she was glowing.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Philip looked at the woman who had spoken earlier. She was standing in place with a retarded look on her face.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i><span>What\u2019s this, what\u2019s this. Is this the sort of face the companion of some big-name noble ought to have? You look just like a roadside peasant.</span></i></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The elation he felt at at the Sorcerous Kingdom\u2019s triumph \u2015 to which he was favourably inclined \u2015 made the joy of victory surge up in his heart.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWe welcome your presence, Albedo-dono.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Ranpossa III rose to welcome Albedo.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYour Majesty, I am grateful for this reception.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Philip could only see a side of Albedo\u2019s face, but when he saw Albedo\u2019s tender smile, he was acutely aware of one thing.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i><span>She\u2019s beautiful beyond words\u2026</span></i></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI do hope you will forgive me for taking a seat, due to my age. Then, nobles of the Kingdom. Our main guest has arrived. Tonight, please enjoy yourselves to your hearts\u2019 content. Then, Albedo-dono, I hope you will enjoy yourself as well.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cMy thanks, Your Majesty.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>A sweet smile bloomed on Albedo\u2019s face.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>He snuck a peek at that noblewoman from earlier, and saw that she was mumbling something about \u201cshe didn\u2019t lower her head\u201d or something along those lines. Philip cast aside that foolish woman and her foolish words and instead feasted his eyes on that world-class beauty.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>He burned the image of her speaking closely with Princess Renner into his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i><span>If only I could make that woman mine\u2026</span></i></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>He understood that it would be a very difficult task. However, when one thought about it, it was not completely impossible.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i><span>Once my fief becomes wealthy, the other nobles will start introducing their daughters to me. The wealthier I get, the better the girls will be. Even that Princess, even that emissary isn\u2019t out of the question!</span></i></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Philip felt a wave of heat surge up from his lower body.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i><span>Well, the Great Nobles usually have a concubine or three\u2026 the best case would be if I could enjoy those two beauties at the same time.</span></i></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Philip looked back and forth between Renner and Albedo.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Philip hurriedly picked up a beverage from nearby before his fantasies grew out of control,. It would be very bad if he got hard here. The cool sensation of the drink sliding down his throat helped him regain a measure of calm.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i><span>Come to think of it, how did they make this ice? Is it magic\u2026</span></i></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The only people in Philip\u2019s estate who could use magic were the priests. While they could help cure illness, they would demand money for doing so. They would ask for an appropriate payment if they had to make ice.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i><span>Since they\u2019re in my domain, I\u2019ll have them heal me for free next time. A mere resident daring to charge his lord money, how ridiculous is that!</span></i></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Philip made a mental note of this new way to deal with the priests in future.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>He looked forward to getting to work on his domain once he returned. He could imagine all his brilliant ideas being put into action, lighting up his life with golden radiance.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i><span>\u2015Oya?</span></i></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>When he looked back to Albedo, he saw her standing by herself.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>There were many nobles around, but nobody knew how to approach her.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i><span>The Sorcerous Kingdom, huh\u2026 What will become of the Kingdom after this?</span></i></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Philip did not particularly care what happened to the Kingdom, but it would be troublesome if it affected his estate.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>That being the case\u2015</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Philip shuddered at the idea he had just had.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i><span>\u2015Oi oi, don\u2019t think about such dangerous things. It\u2019s just\u2026 well, it\u2019s not exactly a bad move, right? How should I say this\u2026 I can\u2019t believe I actually thought of an idea like that\u2026</span></i></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>He looked at the side of Albedo\u2019s lonely face.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i><span>There\u2019s no use in being third. There\u2019s no point in being second. The most important thing is to be the first.</span></i></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The emissary of the Sorcerous Kingdom looked like she had been outcast because nobody was talking to her. Philip had read about how ladies were quite vulnerable to this sort of thing.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i><span>Do it. You have to make a gamble to get a return. The chance to rise has come because everything has changed. I\u2019m a lucky man, so I should make good use of my luck.</span></i></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Philip\u2019s family had always been bound to a faction, but they were typically at the tail end of that faction. There were only so many benefits he could gain from continuing to be bound to that faction.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Then, he recalled some words he had heard recently. A certain very skinny landlady had said, \u201cWhy not make a faction of your own?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>After making up his mind, Philip downed the glass of wine he had been holding all this while.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>It was unlike the watery wine he had drunk at home. It felt like his throat and belly were burning. As though propelled by the heat which rose from his belly, Philip stepped forward.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAlbedo-sama, mind if I cut in?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Thanks to his voice, Albedo turned her smile to him.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>He was not just blushing because of the wine.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAra, how do you do\u2015\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Her brows creased for a moment, as though deep in thought. Philip immediately realized what she was looking for.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI am Philip.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOh? Ah, Lord Philip \u2015 no, Philip-sama. It is an honor to meet you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe pleasure is all mine, Albedo-sama. Nothing could delight me more than to make your acquaintance.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Philip was keenly aware that the air around him seemed to have changed.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>A quick glance aside revealed that the higher-ranked nobles had shocked looks on their faces.</span></p><br/><p><span>He could not stem the joy within him as he realised all eyes at the dinner party sponsored by the Royal Family were on him.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i><span>I, I\u2019m now, I\u2019m now the center of attention!</span></i></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>To think that he \u2015 who had only eaten cold meals in the past \u2015 was now the focus of these people who stood at the pinnacle of the Kingdom. As he thought about this, an unexpected excitement took control of Philip.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i><span>That\u2019s right! I\u2019m Philip! Watch me! Watch the man who will be the central figure of the Kingdom!</span></i></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Philip racked his brains, and then made the biggest bet in his life.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>That was to say, he invited Albedo to a ball which would take place a couple of days later.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u2666 \u2666 \u2666</span></p><ul><li></li></ul><br/><p><span>\u201cYou moron!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>That rebuke extinguished Philip\u2019s excitement. Yet, at the same time, it lit a flame within his heart. It was a fire that seemed to consume all the fuel Philip had hidden within his heart his entire life.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Philip looked disdainfully at the white-haired man before him.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI didn\u2019t send you there for that sort of thing! You imbecile!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Philip sighed as his father asked him about the dinner at the Royal Palace.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIn the first place, that invitation to that dinner party organized by the Royal Family would never have come to our house. I worked my fingers to the bone to secure it so you could express your gratitude to the Count and to the other nobles while you made yourself known to them!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The Royal Family\u2019s dinner party gathered people from both factions. When this happened, the fact that the head of a family had changed would probably not come up. Thus, nobody would pay too much attention to that fact and he would be readily accepted by others. After that, once they had tacitly acknowledged him, it would be quite difficult for them to protest that fact.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>In other words, Philip\u2019s father had no faith in his abilities at all. He felt that if he had tried to introduce himself to the other members of his faction in the normal manner, he would mess something up.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>As Philip realised this, he strove to suppress the annoyance within him, and put on a fake smile.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo, no, Father. Don\u2019t get so worked up. I was doing this for our house\u2015\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2015What do you mean, \u2018our house\u2019? What you\u2019ve done is completely absurd!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i><span>What did he mean, absurd,</span></i><span> Philip griped in his heart. Everyone else was a coward without the courage to make a move, so why should he not take the first step?</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Was he supposed to pretend to be polite to all those incompetent cowards and remain in this pathetic place for the rest of his life?</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cFather! Think a little! Although the road joining the Sorcerous Kingdom and the Kingdom is quite long, our domain lies on the middle of it! If the Sorcerous Kingdom makes war on the Kingdom, we\u2019ll definitely be drawn into the mess. Therefore, we should forge good relations with the Sorcerous Kingdom, shouldn\u2019t we?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span></span></p><br/><p>\n</p></div>"}

For some reason, it became another big and heavy volume.</p><br/><p><span>When I first started writing this, I asked the editor \u201cSince there\u2019s not much to write for this volume, I should be able to wrap it up in around 200 pages, right?\u201d. But when I received the printed volume, I wondered \u201cWhy is it so thick?\u201d</span><span></span></p><br/><p><span>It is a mystery.</span></p><br/><p><span>It\u2019s really strange. Where did the extra 200 pages come from?</span></p><br/><p><span>Still, I want to try finishing a volume that\u2019s around 300 pages long, and not 300 pages each for just Part 1 and Part 2.</span></p><br/><p><span>Either way, I don\u2019t know what happened, but the developments in the next volume will be completely different from the web novel, which makes me kind of nervous. Still, I hope everyone will enjoy it. I\u2019m going to say up front that Volume 10 will be 300 pages long.</span></p><br/><p><span>Speaking of which, last week, the \u201cOverlord\u201d manga drawn by Miyama Fugin-sensei went on sale. This week, Volume 9 of the light novel came out, and next week will be the start of the Overlord animation broadcast. These 3 weeks will be full of Overlord.</span></p><br/><p><span>We produced something great thanks to the help of everyone working on it. (Especially So-bin sama\u2026 He has so much work to do, it makes me tear up everytime I think about it. It\u2019s like\u2026 well, sometimes I feel like I\u2019m giving myself a hard time). I hope you all can enjoy the manga, the novel and the anime.</span></p><br/><p><span>And now for, the usual acknowledgements.</span></p><br/><p><span>Thank you very much to So-bin-sama, for his amazing illustrations and working on the animation and manga with all his soul.</span></p><br/><p><span>The designer, Chord Design Studio not only worked on the light novel, but on the Overlord animation\u2019s logo as well. The anime logo is cool and amazing. Murata-sama, who worked hard for drawing out the map. Ohaku-sama and Itou-sama edit and performed detailed checks, so thank you as well. I\u2019m gratefulto everybody who worked hard to help me make this thick volume, but to F-da-sama who doesn\u2019t think Overlord is very thick compared to other books he\u2019s in charge of, thank you as well. And to Hani who, as a father, said \u201cchildren are amazing\u201d at the scene with Marquis Raeven, thank you very much, as always.</span></p><br/><p><span>Although I can\u2019t fit everyone in here, I thank everyone who took part in not just the novel, but in manga and Overlord animation as well!</span></p><br/><p><span>And of course, my greatest thanks goes to those readers who have followed all of the volumes.</span></p><br/><p><span>2015 June</span></p><br/><p><span>Maruyama Kugane</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

Overlord has reached its 5th volume in the blink of an eye. Please allow me to thank everyone who has supported this series. Thank you very much.</p><br/><p><span>Speaking of which, since Volumes 5 and 6 are going to be linked, I was wondering, \u201cdo I need an afterword?\u201d I discussed it with Editor-san and in the end Editor-san said that some readers would look forward to it, so I should probably write one\u2026 But does anyone really look forward to the afterword? Are afterwords really that interesting\u2026? Hm, so does Editor-san mean that I should force myself to write something interesting?</span></p><br/><p><span>Something interesting\u2026 Well, in order to handle the myriad issues that have cropped up for volumes 5 and 6, I spent all my days off between August to the end of November at home in order to rush out the book\u2026 that\u2019s all I have.</span></p><br/><p><span>Also, since volume 6 includes a Drama CD like volume 4, time is even tighter than normal. It\u2019s a really breakneck pace\u2026</span></p><br/><p><span>But that\u2019s a part-time writer for you!</span></p><br/><p><span>Hm. It\u2019s\u2026 not interesting at all. I\u2019m ruining everyone\u2019s hopes and dreams, I know.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then, let\u2019s change the topic.</span></p><br/><p><span>The WN version of Overlord is also updating, but volume 6 is going to be 90% new content.</span></p><br/><p><span>Initially, I focused on adding new elements when rewriting the WN chapters for release. You will see this in the next volume.</span></p><br/><p><span>The manuscript is already complete, so if nothing crops up, it ought to come out for sale in January 2014. I hope we can meet again in that volume\u2019s afterword.</span></p><br/><p><span>Now then, the thanks. </span></p><br/><p><span>So-bin-sama, who does illustrations for the books, Chord Design Studio, which does the book design, Ohaku-sama, who does proofreading, F-da-sama, the Editor, as well as everyone who helped to make Overlord \u2014 thank you, everyone. Also, thank you for all your help, Honey.</span></p><br/><p><span>Finally, thank you to all you readers for buying this book! You have my sincerest gratitude!</span></p><br/><p><span>2013 December</span></p><br/><p><span>Maruyama Kugane</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

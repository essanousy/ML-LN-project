The drawer which had once held potions now contained neat stacks of documents. He was free of all his troubles, he no longer collected hair from his pillow, and he was no longer shocked by how much of it there was.</div><div class=\"western\">How refreshing!</div><div class=\"western\">How pleasant!</div><div class=\"western\">How comfortable!</div><div class=\"western\">This was probably the first time in his life that he had been filled with such a feeling of liberation. He felt so good that he could not help but imagine he had sprouted wings with which he could flap into the sky.</div><div class=\"western\">He put his heartfelt smile away and faced his subordinate. <i>You smile more often now</i>, his not-beautiful concubine had said, but this was not a time to let others see him smile. Dignity was a thing that caused many when it was lost.</div><div class=\"western\">And so, the usual morning meeting began.</div><div class=\"western\">Jircniv had many scribes, but the one before him now was an excellent man called Roune Varmilinen.</div><div class=\"western\">At first, he had been worried that something had been done to him after he had returned from the Sorcerer King\u2019s palace, and so he had placed him in a sinecure. However, that too was a thing of the past. Roune\u2019s position as head scribe was now secure. This was not because he was certain that nothing had been done to him. It was simply to prove that he had nothing to hide from the Sorcerous Kingdom. In addition, it was also a fact that Roune was very skilled.</div><div class=\"western\">He glanced over the document he had taken from Roune, and due to the ridiculous content within, Jircniv lost control of himself and burst into laughter.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWhoever wrote this was quite the comedian. What do you think of the Sorcerer King\u2019s death?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cFirst of all, I am absolutely certain, with practically zero chance of it being otherwise, that this is one hell of a lie.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Jircniv agreed with what Roune had said.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAhh, that\u2019s right. It must be fake. Besides, it\u2019s impossible that His Majesty would lose or die or whatever.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Nobody could possibly kill a magic caster who could crush an army of 200,000 with a single spell and fight in armed combat with the Martial Lord, the Empire\u2019s mightiest warrior. Jircniv was certain of that.</div><div class=\"western\">Of course, he could not be poisoned either, and he could not fall to disease or die of old age. It was more likely that someone was spreading a bad joke on a massive scale in order to make the punchline of \u201c\u2026because he was already dead to begin with.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWell, it\u2019s probably to root out any malcontents. Still, I have a question.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWhich is?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThat is to say, I am wondering why His Majesty, who possesses unrivalled intellect, is resorting to a lame little scheme like this which anyone can see through. Unless it means there\u2019s some other\u2026 yes, it\u2019s possible there may be some grand conspiracy brewing that even I cannot discern\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Who could say for sure that it was not the case? No, if this was a scheme laid by the monstrous intellect who knew every detail of Jircniv\u2019s movements, then Jircniv was certain that this was nothing but the tip of the iceberg. For all Jircniv knew, even thinking that way might have been part of his plan.</div><div class=\"western\">However, what if this was not a scheme hatched by the Sorcerer King, but by one of his underlings \u2014 for instance, that toad-like monster that looked like an imbecile?</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t know. Besides, if you can\u2019t figure out something you want to figure out, you can only give up on it. More to the point, all we need to do is obey Albedo-sama, the prime minister of the Sorcerous Kingdom, and do what she says. There\u2019ll be no problems so long as we don\u2019t betray them and complete our tasks. As the ruler of a vassal nation, I won\u2019t be so easily purged if I\u2019m appropriately incompetent.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIt is as you say.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Roune shrugged.</div><div class=\"western\">In the past, he was a person who would not make such movements, but his many experiences had trained him to do so. Or perhaps it was because he had grown bold.</div><div class=\"western\">Regardless of whether the Sorcerer King was dead or alive, all would be well as long as the Empire did not stop being a vassal of the Sorcerous Kingdom. In this way, they would be immune to any stratagem the opposition employed. Loyalty was the best defense. If they were killed even after giving their loyalty, then all they could do was laugh at the pettiness of the other party and go to the grave in peace.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cNow then, is that all the work for today?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Ever since the vassalization, Jircniv\u2019s administrative workload had dropped to around half of before, Still, today\u2019s workload seemed too light.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cNo, Your Majesty, there\u2019s still something else. This is a document we received this morning. It was submitted by the knight legions.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Unfortunately, his work was not yet done.</div><div class=\"western\">Jircniv accepted the proffered document with a mocking smile on his face.</div><div class=\"western\">He glanced briefly through it. It seemed to contain the knights\u2019 complaints about their legion being reorganized</div><div class=\"western\">In the past, he would have given a certain amount of special consideration to the knights. Or rather, considering Jircniv had many nobles as his enemies, he could not allow the enemy to snatch away the martial force which the knights represented. However, things were different now.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cTell them this: you can tell His Majesty the Sorcerer King in person. I can\u2019t believe they wasted paper on this.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The paper used in these reports was made by utility magic, and it cost more than usual regardless of the tier of spell that was used to make it. Jircniv could have thrown it away after use without any concerns, but he did not intend to tolerate excessive expenses.</div><div class=\"western\">Paper made from zero tier spells was crumpled. It was coarse and discolored.</div><div class=\"western\">Paper conjured from first tier utility spells was thinner and whiter. Papermaking techniques could produce paper of this quality as well, but their yield was lower and so the paper was more expensive.</div><div class=\"western\">Second tier utility spells produced very thin and very white paper. Of course, one could color magically created paper to a certain extent. Spells of this tier could produce a very soft and high class paper known as noble paper, which was the principal yield of those spells..</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cStill, it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t understand why they\u2019re so resistant to letting another country handle our national defense.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cDon\u2019t complain about that to me, tell Albedo-sama. Also, didn\u2019t we already say that we weren\u2019t entrusting everything to them?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">This came from Prime Minister Albedo\u2019s instructions to supplement the Empire\u2019s military manpower with the Sorcerous Kingdom\u2019s undead armies.</div><div class=\"western\">Jircniv believed that this was part of the program to complete the vassalization process, and so he obeyed it. He planned to let some of the knights retire and disbanded two of the Empire\u2019s eight legions.</div><div class=\"western\">This ought to have been a good idea since there were many people who were mentally exhausted from that massacre, but there had still been some disgruntlement about the lack of seats which could be taken.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAnd I even prepared positions for them to transfer into\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cPeople are just unhappy at losing their privileges and uneasy about doing jobs they\u2019ve never done before, I think.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIf it\u2019s the latter, then they just have to work hard, but if it\u2019s the former, then it\u2019s only to be expected. Or am I expected to pay people who simply do their job and engage in physical labor the same amount that people in hazardous jobs receive?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Jircniv snorted and disregarded it.</div><div class=\"western\">Perhaps he would have needed to masterfully manipulate them in the past, but now there was no need for that.</div><div class=\"western\">Jircniv had the backing of someone called the Sorcerer King who possessed absolute power. No matter what happened, all he had to do was say, \u201cPlease tell His Majesty yourself,\u201d and all dissent was quashed in an instant.</div><div class=\"western\">Nobody in the Empire could express their displeasure to someone who could slaughter on such a scale and even defeat the Martial Lord in combat.</div><div class=\"western\">While they had used to field their complaints to Jircniv in the past, his position was now secure, given that he was a servant of the Sorcerer King. No, because he was feared, he ought to say it was more secure than secure. Immovable, perhaps?</div><div class=\"western\">And frankly, there were shockingly few people in the Empire who were unhappy about becoming vassals of the Sorcerous kingdom. That was because the Sorcerous Kingdom made very few demands. There were quite a few finely detailed requests, but there were only two main demands.</div><div class=\"western\">The first was to amend a part of the Empire\u2019s law \u2014 this was to emphasize the absolute nature of the Sorcerer King and his confidants.</div><div class=\"western\">The second was to hand over criminals sentenced to the death penalty. This was shocking in the opposite sense. While he had felt that they would suffer horrible fates, one of them had been safely returned for the reason, \u201cHe was framed, and so he was innocent.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">And so, one could say that there was practically no change from daily life.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cCome, let\u2019s finish up quick so I can meet my friend.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Today, a true friend that Jircniv had just made was scheduled to visit him. All the preparations for his welcome were complete, and all that was left was for Jircniv to finish his work.</div><div class=\"western\">He spent half an hour taking care of sundry tasks, and then his subordinate entered the room after receiving the approval of his guards and Jircniv himself.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYour Majesty, your guest has arrived\u2014\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cOhh! Hurry and let him in!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">His work was not yet finished. Still, what about it? What could be more important than greeting a friend?</div><div class=\"western\">Soon, his friend was led into the room by his subordinates.</div><div class=\"western\">Jircniv rose, his face all smiles, and he spread his arms in welcome and invited his guest in.</div><div class=\"western\">It was a demihuman who looked like a short, squat mole. The enchanted pendant he had given him dangled back and forth.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cOhhh! Welcome! My true friend, Riyuro!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Jircniv embraced Riyuro without any hesitation and wrapped his arms around him.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAhhh! Jircniv, oh friend with whom I have shared my troubles! I am deeply grateful for your welcome!</div><div class=\"western\">Riyuro embraced Jircniv as well. Given the sharp claws on his forelimbs, one could see the gentleness in his movements as he took care not to hurt Jircniv with them.</div><div class=\"western\">They held each other for a while, and then slowly broke apart.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2014What are you saying? My doors are always open to you, Riyuro.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Riyuro grinned.</div><div class=\"western\">While a demihuman\u2019s smiling face looked vicious, Jircniv understood that he was smiling. Such was the intimacy of their relationship.</div><div class=\"western\">Jircniv was suddenly struck by how interesting this was.</div><div class=\"western\">He had been born and raised as a candidate to be the next Emperor, and everyone around him of his age considered him the Crown Prince. Therefore, he had not had anyone he could call a friend. But now, the fact that his first friend was a demihuman\u2014</div><div class=\"western\">\u2014<i>Hmph. If I had told my past self from ten or fifteen years ago about this, he wouldn\u2019t have believed it\u2026 For this, if nothing else, I have to thank that undead being.</i></div><div class=\"western\">He had first met this dear friend before him in a waiting room when he had gone to seek an audience with the Sorcerer King.</div><div class=\"western\">At that time, he had simply wondered where this demihuman had come from and how far the Sorcerer King\u2019s domination reached.</div><div class=\"western\">But after that, they met again, and engaged each other in conversation to learn more about each other \u2014 and then they clicked. After a minute together that could have been a month, a deep friendship was born.</div><div class=\"western\">That was why they no longer addressed each other with honorifics, This was not because they were both kings.</div><div class=\"western\">Indeed, it was because the two of them\u2014</div><div class=\"western\"></div><div class=\"western\">\u2014Were both being tormented by the same oppressor \u2014 they were comrades in suffering.</div><div class=\"western\"></div><div class=\"western\">\u201cCome, I\u2019ve prepared all sorts of delicacies that will surprise you. Shall we not reward ourselves for our labors today?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAh, I would be glad to, Jircniv. I too have brought many of the mushrooms you said were delicious. Let us eat them later.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cOhhh! Thank you, Riyuro.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The mushrooms Riyuro had brought were fragrant and meaty, and they were a luxury ingredient called Obsidian.</div><div class=\"western\">The two of them left the room side by side.</div><div class=\"western\">In the past, Jircniv had been uneasy when he heard that the Sorcerous Kingdom treated demihumans the same way it treated humans.</div><div class=\"western\">However he snuck a glance at Riyuro beside him and thought.</div><div class=\"western\">Demihumans were not that bad. At least, compared to the undead \u2014 the Sorcerer King.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cSpeaking of which, have you heard, Riyuro? The Sorcerer King seems to have kicked the bucket.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Riyuro expelled a great rush of air from his nose. This was his way of snorting in laughter.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cJircniv, that is impossible. How \u2014 how could someone like him die?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIndeed, I agree with that statement. However\u2026 which nation will see its people lamenting this time\u2026?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYes\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Riyuro and Jircniv both looked to the sky.</div><div class=\"western\">There was pain in their eyes. They grieved for a tragedy that was happening in some faraway place, and the shared sympathy that soon they would gain a new comrade.</div><div class=\"western\"></div><div class=\"western\">***</div><div class=\"western\"></div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\"></div><div class=\"western\">The cry that suddenly rang through the room made the man go stiff. He belonged to a secret organization called Eight Fingers, and while he had seen many things before, he had never seen an eruption of such dark emotions. It seemed like genuine hatred and unadulterated cursing.</div><div class=\"western\">He would not have been shocked if it had come from an enemy. Indeed, he would be smiling instead. However, the person making that sound was a friend, a friend who understood him due to having gone through the same suffering and misery that he had.</div><div class=\"western\">Friends \u2014 he thought that there could not be a word that was less applicable to him than that.</div><div class=\"western\">Until recently, the fellow members of his organization had struggled to hamstring each other, steal power, and searched for each others\u2019 weaknesses every day. If their aims clashed, then there would have been blood.</div><div class=\"western\">However, things were different now.</div><div class=\"western\">If even one less person could not pull their weight, everyone would have to do more work, and it would be more likely that they would fail. When that happened, they would be held responsible as well and dragged into that hell. Even being punished once would be enough to condemn one to a liquid diet and be plagued by nightmares. For all he knew, there were other hells waiting for him.</div><div class=\"western\">With that in mind, whenever anyone began to fall behind in their work, everyone would immediately give them their full support, worry about their health, and fret about their mental state. They would do so desperately.</div><div class=\"western\">They had become true companions, those who shared their lives and whose fates were one.</div><div class=\"western\">And one of those friends was now screaming and rolling around on the cold stone floor. The fear called \u201cif you don\u2019t find out the reason soon, you\u2019ll end up like that too\u201d drove the man to action.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWhat, what is it, Hilma? What happened?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The wailing woman stopped moving, and her eyes slid up from below to look at the man.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2014I\u2019ve had it! Swap with me! My stomach hurts! I need to watch that idiot\u2019s movements! What the hell\u2019s wrong with him!? Being around that idiot is driving me mad!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">They knew only one man who could be called an idiot. While they had used the word \u201cidiot\u201d often until now, that man was enough to show others what it truly meant to be an idiot, and so they could no longer use the word idiot lightly.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWhat is it? What\u2019s that idiot done now?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Hilma spoke quickly, like she was vomiting her pent-up rage.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAh, yes! You heard about it, right, how His Majesty perished!?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">He wanted her to slow down a little, but it sounded like Hilma was venting her stress. Therefore, he did not interrupt her, but listened patiently.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cMm, of course.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Eight Fingers had been the ones who spread the news. Of course, it went without saying that they had used unrelated merchants to spread the news through the Kingdom.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWhat do you think he said after hearing about it!?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Well, he was an idiot, after all. He had to consider that point before answering. However, all he could think of were ordinary answers. Still, there was no telling what an idiot thought, so he gave up in the end and said something normal.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026He said something about the burial?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIf that were all, my stomach wouldn\u2019t hurt like this! He, he said that if he married Albedo-sama, he would be able to inherit the Sorcerous Kingdom!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAiiieeee!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The man squeaked and looked around himself.</div><div class=\"western\">The man could not sense them but there ought to have been watchers from the Sorcerous Kingdom here. After making sure that they had not made their move, the man sighed in relief.</div><div class=\"western\">They had been ordered to prepare an idiot, but he would much rather not be pushed into that hell because he was an idiot that defied all comparison.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cOi oi oi! We were ordered to prepare an idiot, but why don\u2019t we just kill him off? Wouldn\u2019t it be better to prepare a more suitable idiot!?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cCan we prepare anyone else at this point?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The man\u2019s answer made Hilma roll around while screaming \u201cAhhhhhhhh!\u201d The hem of her dress rode up her leg and above her thigh.</div><div class=\"western\">She had originally been a high class whore and was still as beautiful as one, but all the man could feel for her charmless, disgraceful state now was sympathy.</div><div class=\"western\">After all, he knew very well that if he had been assigned to the same task, he would have been rolling around on the floor instead of Hilma.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cCome on Hilma, give it your best.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">She suddenly stopped and glared at the man before speaking.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be alright if you manipulated that man\u2026 or made sure he didn\u2019t do anything excessive?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIdiots like that ought to be controlled by women. Am I right?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">After hearing that question, Hilma went \u201cAhhhhhhhhhhhh!\u201d again and continued rolling around on the ground.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI think it won\u2019t last much longer. We\u2019ll move in earnest after another two or three years. Get more idiots together before that. We\u2019ll do our best to help if you need to form a faction of idiots.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cTwo years is too long ahhhhhhhhh!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cStill, those are our orders. Control the information they receive, and make a faction that will do even more foolish things.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThat\u2019s true ahhhhhhhh!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Hilma suddenly stopped, and then she bolted upright.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYou\u2019ve got it easy. All you need to do is mobilize the traders and spread the news of the Sorcerer King \u2014 His Majesty\u2019s! \u2014 death to the Second Prince.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\"><i>You make it sound so easy,</i> he thought,</div><div class=\"western\">In the past, he did not think that prince was very bright. However, he had slowly come to realize that this was because of the First Prince, which had made him disguise himself.</div><div class=\"western\">It was because the Second Prince was intelligent that getting the news to him required extremely careful and complicated maneuvering.</div><div class=\"western\">This was to keep him from realizing that he worked for the Sorcerous Kingdom.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026It\u2019s not as easy as you say it is.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026Ahh, my apologies. It\u2019s given you a lot of work too, right\u2026 how about tonight, coming?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Hilma mimed the action of drinking a big mouthful of wine.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cSounds good. I need to make sure I don\u2019t leak anything even when I\u2019m stinking drunk.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">They may not been able to eat solid foods, but drinking was a different matter.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHaha,\u201d a withered smile appeared on Hilma\u2019s face. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine. Our watchers will help us take care of it.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHaha,\u201d a similar look appeared on his face. \u201cThat\u2026 is true\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cBut now that you mention it, where\u2019s that lucky fellow now\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">There was only one person among them who could be considered a lucky fellow.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cCoccodol, huh? He\u2019s still in jail because he lost his power during that struggle\u2026 lucky him.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYou\u2019re right\u2026 he really is\u2026\u201d</div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

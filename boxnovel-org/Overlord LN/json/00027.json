While it was about the same size as the Green Claw village, there were more Lizardmen here, probably because the Lizardmen from other tribes had steadily flocked to it.</p><br/><p>Now that they were preparing for war, everyone was very busy.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to hold myself back with the mood in the air.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was an audible intake of air from Zenberu\u2019s nose as he inhaled the ambient scent. It was an odor that boiled one\u2019s blood. However, Crusch had never smelled it before, and she said something different from the other two.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it safe to ride over with Rororo?\u201d</p><br/><p>Having sensed the tense atmosphere from a distance, Crusch the plant monster was starting to feel nervous, and she said as much. She was worried that the battle ready Lizardmen would rush Rororo if he got close.</p><br/><p>They might know Zaryusu, but not Crusch or Zenberu, and it was not as though everyone in the the Razor Tail tribe knew Zaryusu either.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s the opposite. We\u2019re safer mounted on Rororo.\u201d</p><br/><p>A puzzled look appeared on Crusch\u2019s face (obscured by leaves as it was). Sensing her confusion, Zaryusu elaborated:</p><br/><p>\u201cMy brother should have come by earlier, and he should have told them that I\u2019d be riding Rororo. Therefore, news about us on Rororo\u2019s back should have reached him by now, so all we have to do is advance slowly.\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact, as Rororo was splashing through the marsh, a black Lizardman emerged from the village. Zaryusu waved to the familiar figure.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd that would be my brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them spoke as one. Crusch was genuinely curious, while Zenberu was like a beast that had sighted a powerful entity.</p><br/><p>As Rororo moved forward, the distance between the two of them \u2014\u200b between Zaryusu and Shasuryu \u2014\u200b grew shorter. Soon, they were close enough to see each other\u2019s faces, and the brothers looked at each other.</p><br/><p>They had only been apart for two days. However, they had prepared themselves for the eventuality that they would never see each other again, so their reunion was particularly touching.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re back, Zaryusu!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, and I have good news, Shasuryu!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shasuryu\u2019s gaze fell on the two people seated behind Zaryusu. Zaryusu felt Crusch\u2019s arms tighten somewhat around his waist, due to her tension.</p><br/><p>Once they were in front of Shasuryu, Rororo stopped in front of the familiar face and nosed at him with its four heads.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t bring any food with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the instant Rororo heard those words, its heads immediately recoiled from Shasuryu, like a child throwing a tantrum. The Hydra might not be able to understand Lizardmen, but it must have telepathically sensed his thoughts. Either that, or it did not smell any food on him.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get off, then.\u201d</p><br/><p>After waving to the other two, he lightly hopped off Rororo\u2019s back, and then took Crusch\u2019s hand as she jumped down. Shasuryu looked at Crusch with a look of puzzlement on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s that plant monster?\u201d</p><br/><p>The fact that everyone reacted the same way left Crusch a little demoralized, but she had no desire to contest it. That was probably due to Zenberu\u2019s constant needling of her. But the words which followed were a bombshell that made Crusch stiffen up.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the female that I love.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014\u200bOhh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shasuryu murmured in awe. Then, he turned his attention to the still-frozen Crusch, who was holding his little brother\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cMuu\u2026 One thing, is the person inside beautiful?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, and we\u2019re considering marr\u2014\u200b!\u201d</p><br/><p>The sudden pain in his hand shut Zaryusu up, because the person holding it had jabbed her claws into Zaryusu\u2019s hand, and very forcefully too. Shasuryu looked at them with some displeasure.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see\u2026 To think someone like you who went on and on about appearances and said\u2026 what was it, \u2018You know I can\u2019t get married?\u2019 You were just trying to act cool. You just didn\u2019t have anyone to fall in love with\u2026 anyway, back to business. I am Shasuryu Shasha, chief of the Green Claw tribe. Thank you both for joining us.\u201d</p><br/><p>The way Shasuryu spoke did not seek out confirmation of their alliance, but radiated the certainty that they would help. However, Crusch and Zenberu were not the sort to be rattled by small things like that.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe should be the ones thanking you. I am the acting chief of the Red Eye tribe, Crusch Lulu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone expected Zenberu to introduce himself after Crusch was done greeting Shasuryu, but they did not hear anything of the sort. Instead. Zenberu eyed Shasuryu from head to toe.</p><br/><p>After he was satisfied with what he had seen, he nodded and spoke with a bestial expression on his face:</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, so you\u2019re the one \u2014\u200b the warrior who uses priestly skills in battle. I\u2019ve heard of your deeds.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m quite surprised that even the Dragon Tusk tribe knows of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shasuryu\u2019s response felt like two wild animals circling each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cUntil your brother agrees to take the position, I am the chief of the Dragon Tusk tribe, Zenberu Gugu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for coming. You certainly seem suited to be the chief of the tribe which values strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about a go, then? We need to show each other our strength, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026That\u2019s not a bad idea.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zaryusu did not feel like stopping them. It was true that once they figured out who was stronger, many things would become much simpler in the future.</p><br/><p>However, Shasuryu raised his hand before they could get into it, and put out the flames of Zenberu\u2019s eagerness for battle.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014\u200bAt least, I think it\u2019s a good idea, but now doesn\u2019t seem like the right time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shasuryu smiled as Zenberu frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026The scouts we\u2019ve sent out ought to be returning soon, so we\u2019ll be able to learn about the enemy. It won\u2019t be too late to spar after they\u2019ve given their report, no?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2666 \u2666 \u2666</p><br/><p>There was a small house that was being used as the meeting room for the various chiefs.</p><br/><p>All the chiefs and Zaryusu were here, for a total of six people.</p><br/><p>The name of Zaryusu \u2014\u200b bearer of Frost Pain and slayer of the former chief of the Razor Edge tribe \u2014\u200b was famous among the tribes. In addition, he was the hero who had persuaded the Red Eye and Dragon Tusk tribe to join their alliance, so none of the chiefs here opposed his presence.</p><br/><p>The six of them sat in a circle within the cramped interior. The three chiefs had been hard-pressed to hide their surprise when Crusch revealed her snow-white skin, but they had calmed down now.</p><br/><p>After greetings were done with, the first to speak was the chief of the Small Fang tribe.</p><br/><p>He was small-framed for a Lizardman, but he had honed his limbs until they were as hard as steel. He had originally been a hunter, so he was probably the best ranged attacker among all the Lizardmen around this lake. In fact, he had eliminated all of his opponents during the chief selection trials with a single well-aimed stone apiece.</p><br/><p>After mobilizing all the hunters to scout, he now understood the disposition of the enemy.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe enemy numbers around five thousand.\u201d</p><br/><p>This figure was far in excess of the Lizardmen\u2019s troop strength, but it was still within the range they had expected. Someone even sighed in relief as they heard that figure.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Then, who\u2019s the enemy leader?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not sure. The scouts spotted huge monsters that looked like giant blobs of red meat, but it was hard to get close to them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about their makeup?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an undead army, with skeletons and zombies.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid they use Lizardman corpses?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, the corpses did not come from Lizardmen. I don\u2019t know land-dwelling creatures too well, so I\u2019m not confident in identifying them, but they were probably humanoids of some sort and I didn\u2019t see any tails.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing about those characteristics, Zaryusu was sure that they were from a plains tribe \u2014\u200b humans.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we take the initiative and launch a preemptive strike?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat would be difficult. The enemy is using a clearing in the forest as a staging area, but how long did they take to clear it? I didn\u2019t even see the logs which should have been left over \u2014\u200b ah, I\u2019ve gone off-topic. In any case, they\u2019re in the forest. It\u2019s questionable whether we could get into position by ourselves. It would be very difficult if we had to bring the warriors too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen how about sending the hunters to ambush them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGIve us a break, Crusch-kun. There\u2019s only twenty five hunters. How could we defeat five thousand undead? All we\u2019d accomplish is dying.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm\u2026 then how about mobilizing the priests?\u201d</p><br/><p>Several people nodded at Shasuryu\u2019s suggestion, and turned to Crusch. However, Zaryusu answered the question.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think it would be better if we did not.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? Why is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe opposition has honored their agreement so far, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll extend to allowing us to launch a sneak attack.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed. Seems like it would be best not to make the first move before all the tribes gather.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen are we going to prepare for a siege?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDefending sounds hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>That inarticulate voice came from one of the Lizardmen, the chief of the Razor Tail tribe.</p><br/><p>He was dressed in a suit of white armor, which shone with a luster not born of metal.</p><br/><p>The armor radiated a faint magical aura. It was one of the Four Treasures \u2014\u200b the White Dragon Bone.</p><br/><p>This armor was made from the cold-infused bones of the Frost Dragons which laired within the Azellisian Mountain Range. Of course, armor made of mere bones \u2014\u200b even the bones of powerful beings like Dragons \u2014\u200b could not possibly be magical. Yet, somewhere along the line, that suit of armor had taken on magical properties.</p><br/><p>The problem now was that said properties might have been the result of a curse.</p><br/><p>That was because the White Dragon Bone converted intellect into defensive strength. If an intelligent person put it on, it would become harder than steel \u2014\u200b it might even be able to rival the strength of mithril, or the legendary metal adamantite.</p><br/><p>However, the lost intelligence would not return even if the armor was removed. That was why the legends surrounding that item said it was cursed.</p><br/><p>The armor\u2019s wearer had originally inhabited the peak of Lizardman intellect, and after he put on that armor, it became tough enough to deflect any and all weapons the Lizardmen possessed \u2014\u200b even Frost Pain of the Four Treasures. Its hardness might well be on the same level as adamantite.</p><br/><p>Also, while the armor\u2019s wearers typically lost their powers of reason and became mentally deficient, he was still capable of thought, which was a testament to his original intellect. As a result, the Razor Tail tribe no longer decided chieftainship succession through combat after he was born.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere, here is swamp. Poor foundation. Walls\u2026 easily broken.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. Then, shall we sally forth?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, why not? Feels better taking the offensive than to defend. I think each of us has to face three, no four enemies? Easy enough; all we\u2019ll have to do is take them down.\u201d</p><br/><p>As they heard Zenberu\u2019s words, the others looked at each other. Eventually, Crusch changed the subject.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe question now is if the enemy has reinforcements\u2026 they might still be marshalling their strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmmm\u2026 that\u2019s hard to tell. Given the size of that clearing, there shouldn\u2019t be any more space to fit more undead\u2026 that said, all they\u2019d have to do is position them throughout the forest.</p><br/><p>The undead did not need to eat, drink, or rest, and they did not need large campsites. Therefore, it was very hard to tell their numbers from the size of their camps.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems we had best consider a defense scenario for safety\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, we of the Red Eye tribe will strengthen our walls to tide us through the siege. I hope everyone else will help us with that.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other chiefs nodded in agreement, even the disappointed-looking Zenberu.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn any case, let\u2019s start preparing our defenses. We also need to establish a chain of command.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor starters, we\u2019ll assign command of the priests to Crusch-san. She\u2019ll have authority over them in combat as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone agreed, save one.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll the chiefs should form a separate squad of their own.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s eyes went to Zaryusu.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see\u2026 So that\u2019s how it is, little brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is, you want us to form an elite unit, then?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCorrect. The enemy is numerous, and if we don\u2019t eliminate their commander, we might well lose this battle. In addition, if they deploy monsters like the ones they sent to each village as messengers, we won\u2019t be able to overwhelm them with numbers. We\u2019ll need to destroy them using small teams of elite troops.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStill, won\u2019t leaving our men leaderless result in confusion?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust\u2026 pick, pick\u2026 replacement from Head Warriors.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo even if there aren\u2019t any commanders, all they have to do is attack the enemy before them with all their might, huh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What about having the elite squad give orders from behind and only move out when they find the enemy\u2019s headquarters or if the situation turns bad?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat ought to be pretty good, right? Then, let\u2019s form a six-man squad with everyone here, including Zaryusu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, let\u2019s divide it further, into teams of three.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dividing into two teams meant that they could fight in two places, but it also meant their strength would be divided and weakened.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne team will be a search-and-destroy unit to deal with the enemy commanders, while the others will be responsible for tying up their garrison troops.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, I think having we three chiefs form one team ought to work. Zaryusu-san can group up with the chiefs he brought along. We\u2019ll adapt the team objectives to suit the circumstances.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, that sounds good. Will that be all right, Zaryusu?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I got it. Crusch, Zenberu, do you object?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe neither. It\u2019s a shame we won\u2019t get to show our stuff, but I\u2019ll obey the winner.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, there\u2019s still four days to the enemy attack?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, is there anything which needs to be prepared ahead of time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need to stockpile stones for throwing and to strengthen our walls. In addition, we need to let the various tribes mingle and establish working relationships so they can function in harmony.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe of the Small Fang tribe would like Shasuryu to handle this, as before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe also\u2026 feel it should be fine\u2026 and you two?\u201d</p><br/><p>Crusch and Zenberu nodded in agreement.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be taking command, then. After this, we\u2019ll decide on our tasks for the next three days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2666 \u2666 \u2666</p><br/><p>After the day\u2019s work was done, Zaryusu walked silently through the bustling village. Several Lizardmen saw the brand on his chest and Frost Pain at his waist, and greeted him respectfully.</p><br/><p>It felt a little troublesome, but he had to respond to them in order to boost morale. Therefore, he put a confident, dignified look on his face, and replied in a bold, fearless voice.</p><br/><p>In this way, Zaryusu reached the location of the walls surrounding the village. Many Lizardmen were there, all their attention focused on erecting the walls as quickly as possible.</p><br/><p>First, they used vegetation to serve as the foundation for wooden pillars and to fill the spaces between them. Then, they covered them with somewhat drier mud. The priests would then enchant them, and the walls were complete. There were cracks on the surface of the walls, probably because their water content had completely evaporated. Then, they repeated the same process on the other side.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Zaryusu. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong, I just wanted to see what you were doing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zaryusu splashed softly over the wet ground as he walked up to Crusch, who was still in her plant monster getup. Then, he pointed to the unceasing activity before him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a dirt wall. We don\u2019t know what sort of enemies we\u2019ll face, so I wanted to make it difficult for them to attack us\u2026 though we haven\u2019t even finished half of it yet, since we don\u2019t have enough time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see\u2026 Still, isn\u2019t it going to break easily, being made of dirt and all?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine. While a thin layer of dirt is easily broken, that\u2019s not the case for a thick wall of dirt. Granted, we haven\u2019t been able to gather enough material for it due to the hasty construction and it\u2019ll be weakened if it rains, but it won\u2019t fall apart so easily.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he thought about it, just about anything would be difficult to destroy if it was made thick enough.</p><br/><p>Dozens of Lizardmen were working as fast as they could before Zaryusu as he agreed with that conclusion, but they were proceeding at a turtle\u2019s pace. Even if they pushed themselves for three days straight, the wall still would not be that long, but it was better than nothing.</p><br/><p>\u201cCurrently, we\u2019re changing the structure of the fences on the places we can\u2019t cover up, so they can\u2019t be pulled down.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the direction where Crusch was pointing\u2014\u200b</p><br/><p>They had uprooted the wooden pillars and erected them on a triangular clearing. The space between them was laced with loose ropes that had been woven from plant fibers. Zaryusu felt that they seemed similar to the fence surrounding the Red Eye village.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd what is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to put heavy objects in those triangular openings to ensure that the fence doesn\u2019t fall if it\u2019s pushed or pulled. Those ropes are meant to obstruct the enemy\u2019s movements. If they\u2019re drawn taut, they can be easily cut with swords or other bladed weapons, which is why we\u2019ve left some slack in them on purpose,\u201d Crusch eagerly answered Zaryusu\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>She had been the recipient of Zaryusu\u2019s wisdom during their journeys over the past few days, so she was delighted to be able to dole out wisdom for once. In addition, there was another emotion behind that.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see\u2026 That way, it can\u2019t be easily destroyed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those words of respectful praise filled Crusch with pride.</p><br/><p>Zaryusu nodded vigorously.</p><br/><p>They were accelerating the plan to convert this village into a fortress as much as they could. While they could not begin to hold a candle to the defenses of humans or Dwarves, it was the best they could do on these wetlands where movement was difficult.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome to think of it, Zaryusu, did you tell the warriors\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Crusch said that, the wind carried the clamor of the warriors to them. Their voices were filled with excitement and seemed quite hot-blooded.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening? This cheering sounds familiar\u2026 that\u2019s it! They\u2019re cheering for a fight. Could it be that your brother is dueling Zenberu now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zaryusu nodded. Then he realized Crusch had revealed her face and seemed quite worried.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Your brother\u2019s the supreme commander. Won\u2019t things be troublesome if he\u2019s beaten?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Still, my brother\u2019s strong too. Once he has an opening to use his priest spells, he\u2019ll get even stronger. For all I know, I might lose to him as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shasuryu\u2019s strength was extraordinary after applying several buff spells to himself. In addition, while he probably would not use offensive spells during a mock battle, if he did, even Zaryusu \u2014\u200b before he had come into possession of Frost Pain \u2014\u200b would not be a match for him.</p><br/><p>After all, when Zaryusu had defeated the previous owner of Frost Pain, the only reason why said owner had not used its special ability \u2014\u200b limited to three uses a day \u2014\u200b on Zaryusu was because all three instances had already been expended on Shasuryu.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Zaryusu thought he should show the worried Crusch his brother\u2019s fighting form, he recalled the hidden worry he had not brought up until now.</p><br/><p>He did not know if he should mention it, but in the end he decided to do so.</p><br/><p>It was somewhat despicable to talk about something he had chosen not to speak of earlier, now that everything was largely settled. However, he could not hold back the pure and intense feelings he had, and he did not want to hide anything from her.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one thing which worries me\u2014\u200b\u201d</p><br/><p>Crusch laughed as she heard the unease in Zaryusu\u2019s voice. She seemed to be making fun of him. The look on her face did not suit the mood in the air \u2014\u200b or her character, for that matter \u2014\u200b and Zaryusu was left speechless. Therefore, it was Crusch who spoke in his place.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014\u200bIt\u2019s what you didn\u2019t bring up earlier, right? What if the enemy had already seen through our plans and anticipated that we would form an alliance, am I correct?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zaryusu was silent because she had hit the nail on the head.</p><br/><p>In other words, the possibility that the enemy might have given them all this time to prepare, informed them of the attack order, and allowed Zaryusu to form his alliance, all for the purpose of gathering the tribes together so they could all be crushed in one fell swoop.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, you would be worried, given that you\u2019re so prone to introspection. Still, no matter what, it would be best to fight the enemy first and worry about things like that later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if we win, the enemy probably won\u2019t give up. No, in all honesty, there\u2019s very little chance the enemy will give up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat may be so, but you were right about what you said that night. And look\u2014\u200b\u201d</p><br/><p>There did not seem to be anything in the direction where Crusch was pointing. However, Zaryusu understood that she was referring to the entire village.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you see how all the Lizardman tribes are struggling together for the same goal?\u201d</p><br/><p>Indeed, the Lizardmen were all working towards the same objective.</p><br/><p>Zaryusu recalled the great feast which had been held to celebrate the alliance of the Five Tribes. The people of each tribe had mingled without reserve. Of course, it would be wrong to say that the survivors of the two destroyed tribes bore no grudges, but at the very least, they had managed to swallow their resentment.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow ironic,\u201d Zaryusu muttered to himself. He had always thought they would keep themselves secluded for all time, but he had not expected to see everyone united as one due to an external enemy.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe should protect the possibilities that the future holds, Zaryusu. The tribes coming together will surely spur us to grow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zaryusu had never seen the techniques of building walls with mud. However, now that all the other tribes knew it too, the Lizardmen tribes would surely build such walls in future. These sturdy walls would be able to keep out monster incursions. If that happened, the number of attacks on children would drastically decrease, and the Lizardmen\u2019s numbers would increase in turn.</p><br/><p>And as the number of people went up, they could use Zaryusu\u2019s fish farms to feed them.</p><br/><p>Perhaps in the near future, this marsh might become the home of a large, united tribe of Lizardmen.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s win this, Zaryusu. We can\u2019t predict what will happen in the future, and for all we know, all this might be cleared up after we win this battle. If that happens, we\u2019ll be able to expand, and that might bring about a world where we won\u2019t need to worry about killing each other or food shortages.\u201d</p><br/><p>Crusch smiled. Zaryusu fought back the surge of emotion within him, because if he let it run wild, the consequences might be irrecoverable. Still, there was one thing he had to say, no matter what.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really are an outstanding female \u2014\u200b after this battle, please tell me the answer to the question I asked when we first met.\u201d</p><br/><p>Crusch\u2019s smile grew even brighter.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Zaryusu. I\u2019ll tell you after it\u2019s all over\u2014\u200b\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2666 \u2666 \u2666</p><br/><p>Demiurge hummed happily as he worked.</p><br/><p>He picked up a polished bone and considered where best to put it. Before long \u2014\u200b perhaps he had already decided \u2014\u200b he shaved off part of its tip and slotted it into the article before him, which he was building.</p><br/><p>The shaved bone fit snugly into its place, as though it had always belonged there.</p><br/><p>If building a house without nails was called \u201ctimber-frame construction\u201d then Demiurge\u2019s technique could be called \u201cbone-frame construction.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have a good feeling about this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Demiurge smiled as he ran his fingers over the bones. He sensed that he would produce an outstanding work if he carried on like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cStill\u2026 I need a thigh bone from a male of about a hundred twenty centimeters in height.\u201d</p><br/><p>He could still complete it without the bone, but the finished product would not look as good.</p><br/><p>Under normal circumstances, he would let it slide, but this gift was intended for the beloved master to whom he owed his loyalty, so he had to complete it to the best of his ability.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf only I could find a suitable bone.\u201d</p><br/><p>In high spirits, Demiurge moved on.</p><br/><p>The truth was that Demiurge enjoyed making objects like these. It was not a love for bonecrafting, but a love for crafting in general. He was very interested in that field, covering items ranging from objets d\u2019art to furniture, and his techniques had surpassed those of a casual dabbler.</p><br/><p>In fact, his current piece would draw gasps of awe from just about anyone who looked upon it, provided one disregarded the materials from which it was made.</p><br/><p>This tent contained other items as well, such as a statue of his master made from solidified lava, all sorts of chairs, assorted clamps, and so on. All of them were the handiwork of Demiurge. While those pieces were all built for functionality and were not ornamented, they were still excellent specimens of workmanship.</p><br/><p>Demiurge picked up a piece of raw material from the corner of the tent and began evaluating it. Just then, he sensed movement from the tent\u2019s entrance.</p><br/><p>He gently put the bone back and squeezed the irreplaceable item which his master had lent him, before focusing his attention on the movement outside. Under normal circumstances, the person outside ought to be one of his vassals or his comrades. Nobody could breach that triple-layered defense without Demiurge\u2019s knowledge. Still, it was true that he had to be wary of the enemy who had dominated Shalltear.</p><br/><p>Several seconds later, someone opened the tent flap. He was dressed in white and wore a black bird-like mask with a long nose.</p><br/><p>It was Pulcinella.</p><br/><p>He was a clown who had been created by the Supreme Beings, much as Demiurge had. He had been assigned to assist Demiurge for this operation.</p><br/><p>After ensuring that he was not under mind control, the tension left Demiurge\u2019s eyes. At the same time, he released his grip on the artifact in his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cDemiurge-sama, the skinning is complete.\u201d</p><br/><p>Demiurge felt a twinge of regret at those words.</p><br/><p>Originally, Demiurge would have done that work in person to savor it, but the need to be wary of their mysterious and powerful foe meant that he could not leave this place under normal circumstances. Thus, he had handed the task to Pulcinella.</p><br/><p>Taking care to keep his emotions hidden, Demiurge gave Pulcinella new orders.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell done. Then, begin the next step immediately. It would be rude to directly present something in that state to Ainz-sama.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Pulcinella bowed gracefully, Demiurge asked him:</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, how many died?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNone. Thanks to the torturers, they only passed out, so we should be able to skin them soon. While some of them were unwilling to accept healing magic\u2026 it was well within acceptable parameters, so it is not a problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMarvellous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gathering the raw materials was an arduous task, and they had to perform several skinnings to recoup their investment. Even so, he had not used anesthesia or painless methods to remove the skins.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to make everyone happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>This sudden interjection made Demiurge think of Pulcinella\u2019s personality.</p><br/><p>Pulcinella was famous in Nazarick for his kindness and mercy. He had been created to make everyone happy, and so everything he did was intended to fulfill that purpose.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone in the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick is happy to serve Ainz-sama.\u201d</p><br/><p>Demiurge nodded in agreement.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. Then, a question for you, Pulcinella: do you mean that others will be happy to serve Nazarick?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could that be? That was not my meaning. Serving Ainz-sama is truly a blissful thing, one that makes me want to shed tears of joy, but it cannot be counted as true happiness if it is forced.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOhh, then what should be done?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSimple. Pick one person, and chop his arm off. Then, the others will compare themselves to that person and count themselves fortunate. How wonderful! And then, to make the person whose arm was chopped off happy, you simply chop off someone else\u2019s legs! Oh, how happy I have made them!\u201d</p><br/><p>Demiurge nodded at the clown, who was laughing to the high heavens.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. You do have a there.\u201d</p><br/><p><b>Part 2</b></p><br/><p>Time would pass slowly if all one did was wait. However, it practically flew past when one was preparing for a task with a time limit.</p><br/><p>The appointed time had come.</p><br/><p>Today, the searing sun crawled slowly into the sky, which was a cloudless clear blue. There was no sound of wind, and the world was shrouded in a silence so profound that one could hear the proverbial pin drop.</p><br/><p>Pre-battle tension filled the air.</p><br/><p>Someone gulped, and someone\u2019s breathing quickened.</p><br/><p>And after who knew how long since the gathered Lizardmen collectively decided to remain quiet\u2014\u200b</p><br/><p>A hole appeared in the heavens, and a cloud billowed forth. It expanded as swiftly as it had earlier, until it enveloped the entire sky.</p><br/><p>Soon, when the clouds obscured the firmament, when the sun\u2019s light was gone and when all was darkness\u2014\u200b</p><br/><p>The Lizardmen saw countless undead lurch out of the forest and over the border it shared with the swamp. The trees obscured them and prevented them from getting an exact count, so all they could see was an endless tide shambling forward.</p><br/><p>The attackers were 2200 Zombies, 2200 Skeletons, three hundred Undead Beasts, one hundred fifty Skeleton Archers and one hundred Skeleton Riders, for a total of 4950 troops, not including the commander and his retinue.</p><br/><p>The defenders were the army of the Five Tribes.</p><br/><p>The Green Claw tribe had one hundred three warriors, five priests, seven hunters, one hundred twenty four males, and one hundred five females.</p><br/><p>The Small Fang tribe had sixty five warriors, one priest, sixteen hunters, one hundred eleven males, and ninety four females.</p><br/><p>The Razor Tail tribe had eighty nine armored warriors, three priests, six hunters, ninety nine males, and eighty one females.</p><br/><p>The Dragon Tusk tribe had one hundred twenty five warriors, two priests, ten hunters, ninety eight males, and thirty two females.</p><br/><p>The Red Eye tribe had forty seven warriors, fifteen priests, six hunters, fifty nine males, and seventy seven females.</p><br/><p>Their combined fighting strength was 429 warriors, twenty six priests, forty five hunters, four hundred ninety one males, and three hundred eight females, for a total of 1380 people, not including the chiefs and Zaryusu.</p><br/><p>A lopsided battle of over three-to-one odds was about to begin.</p><br/><p>\u2666 \u2666 \u2666</p><br/><p>This was a log cabin.</p><br/><p>It was simply designed and made of bare wood, with little ornamentation to speak of. However, it was a full five meters from floor to ceiling, and it was over twenty meters long and wide.</p><br/><p>There was hardly any furniture here, only a huge mirror hanging on the wall, a massive, sturdy table, and the chairs surrounding it.</p><br/><p>There were several people seated on those chairs, and on the table were many rolled-up parchments \u2014\u200b magic scrolls.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd this is the last one, a teleportation spell scroll.\u201d</p><br/><p>As the high-pitched voice \u2014\u200b which called to mind the image of a young girl \u2014\u200b spoke those words, another scroll was laid on the table.</p><br/><p>The person doing so was a humanoid girl in a maid\u2019s outfit.</p><br/><p>She was adorably cute, with her hair done up in two buns on the side of her head. However, she was surrounded by a strange air, and her eyes were quite unique.</p><br/><p>Said eyes were full and round, but like cheap glass marbles, there was no glow in them. In addition, they did not blink.</p><br/><p>Her slender body was fully encased in an enchanted maid\u2019s uniform, and the high collar completely obscured her neck. Besides her face, none of her flesh was exposed.</p><br/><p>She was one of the Pleiades Battle Maids \u2014\u200b Entoma Vasilisa Zeta.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd then there are the \u300cMessage\u300d scrolls, but the table is getting cluttered, so could someone please clear the table?\u201d</p><br/><p>Entoma looked at the highest ranking person seated at the table, who nodded slowly in response.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, please go ahead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Then. Please. Tidy. Up. Move. Quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing Cocytus acquiesce to Entoma\u2019s directions, the people around the table began working to clear the table.</p><br/><p>Each of them was a heteromorphic being. Some looked like praying mantises, some looked like ants, and one even looked like a gigantic brain.</p><br/><p>Each of them had a different appearance, but they had two things in common. The first was that they were Cocytus\u2019s vassals, and the second was that they all served Nazarick.</p><br/><p>For that reason, they obeyed Entoma despite the fact that she was weaker than them.</p><br/><p>Within the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick\u2019s chain of command, the most crucial factor was not raw power, but whether or not they had been created by one of the Supreme Beings. From that point of view, Entoma ranked very highly.</p><br/><p>After verifying that the table had been cleared\u2014\u200b</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, please take these, Cocytus-sama.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u200bEntoma spoke those words without moving her mouth, and then she picked up the bag by her feet and produced several rolled-up scrolls.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese are scrolls of \u300cMessage\u300d. According to Ainz-sama, they were made with the skin that Demiurge-sama worked hard to obtain. Ainz-sama also said that he would like feedback if any problems came up with their use.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs. That. So? I. Understand. I. Will. Inform. Him. If. Such. Problems. Occur.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cocytus took the scrolls from Entoma with one of his four hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow. It. Seems. Demiurge. Has. Pulled. Even. Further. Ahead. Of. Me.\u201d</p><br/><p>He smiled bitterly to the servants around him as he said that. His servants responded with wry grins of their own.</p><br/><p>As he picked up the scrolls, Cocytus sank into contemplation.</p><br/><p>Cocytus had once heard that the supply of parchment for Nazarick\u2019s low level spell scrolls was running low.</p><br/><p>Finding a place to replenish the stores needed to produce various items was a problem which had to be solved sooner or later. The reserves were still ample for the moment, but if they kept drawing on them, they would eventually run out one day. Therefore, everyone \u2014\u200b their master included \u2014\u200b had begun work on rectifying that situation.</p><br/><p>Part of the solution involved the apple trees on the Sixth Floor, of which he had heard.</p><br/><p>However, this was a problem which Cocytus \u2014\u200b who was responsible for the safety of Nazarick \u2014\u200b could do nothing about. After all, since he was assigned to protection duties, he could not go searching around outside.</p><br/><p>Demiurge \u2014\u200b who had gone around laying foundations outside, would surely solve this problem in the end. One could say that it was only to be expected.</p><br/><p>His friend had accomplished his mission.</p><br/><p>It was an admirable deed, and Cocytus was glad for him. However, the flames of jealousy smoldered within him. The fact that his comrade could aid one of the Supreme Beings \u2014\u200b the master whom he worshipped \u2014\u200b filled him with jealousy.</p><br/><p>His own calling was the defense of Nazarick.</p><br/><p>This weighty task was arguably more important than any order given to the other Guardians. If questioned, any vassal would agree that it was an important task. After all, they could not let common riffraff set foot into the sanctum of the Supreme Beings.</p><br/><p>However, Cocytus could not prove his devotion and loyalty without any intruders.</p><br/><p>That was why Cocytus wanted to prove himself here by obtaining good results.</p><br/><p>To the Guardians, aiding their master was a source of great delight. Cocytus wanted to experience that joy as well.</p><br/><p>Currently, a chance for that stood before him.</p><br/><p>Cocytus turned to look at the image within the mirror and gripped his scroll tightly.</p><br/><p>The mirror did not reflect the interior of the room, but instead it showed part of the swamp. The scene within the Mirror of Remote Viewing was the reason why Cocytus had spent the past two days in the log cabin which Aura had built.</p><br/><p>This battle \u2014\u200b no, when one considered the absolute power of the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick, it was more like a slaughter \u2014\u200b was little more than a way to recover corpses. When he had received this sacred task, Cocytus\u2019s master had also laid down several stipulations.</p><br/><p>The first rule was that Cocytus was forbidden to set foot on the battlefield. Naturally, that extended to his servants as well. He was to use the forces allocated to him to deal with this problem.</p><br/><p>The second rule was that the Elder Lich who had been designated as the army\u2019s commander was to be held back until the end.</p><br/><p>The third rule was that he had to make as many decisions by himself as possible.</p><br/><p>There had been other details besides that, but those were the most important of the orders he had been given.</p><br/><p>His task was to achieve victory using only the forces deployed to the lakeside. However, if he could do it, he could demonstrate his loyalty to his great master.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank. You. Very. Much. Please. Convey. My. Thanks. To. Ainz-sama.\u201d</p><br/><p>Entoma nodded disinterestedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026 Will. You. Be. Returning?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I was given instructions to observe the outcome of this battle.\u201d</p><br/><p>So she was to be an observer, then.</p><br/><p>Cocytus\u2019s blood boiled as he realised the importance of his task.</p><br/><p>Then, it was about time to begin.</p><br/><p>Cocytus cast \u300cMessage\u300d, and gave his orders to the commander of the undead army.</p><br/><p><i>\u2014\u200bAdvance.</i></p><br/><p>\u2666 \u2666 \u2666</p><br/><p>Two bonfires blazed on either side of the raised platform, bathing the surroundings in flickering light.</p><br/><p>On the platform were several Lizardmen, including the chiefs, leaders, and other important figures from each tribe.</p><br/><p>Before the platform were many battle-ready Lizardmen. The clamor from them rose and fell like the tide. It stemmed from their unease, worry, and fear \u2014\u200b they struggled to hide all these emotions, but they could not hide the quaking in their hearts.</p><br/><p>This was the eve of battle. The friends beside them might become corpses in an instant, or they themselves might fall in combat. They would soon be heading to the cruel place that was the battlefield.</p><br/><p>Shasuryu Shasha stepped forward from the assembled chiefs and interrupted their commotion.</p><br/><p>\u201cGathered Lizardmen, heed me!\u201d</p><br/><p>A majestic voice rang through the air. It silenced the immediate surroundings and made Shasuryu\u2019s words sound exceptionally resonant.</p><br/><p>\u201cI confess that our enemy is numerous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nobody made a sound, but everybody could sense the tremors in the air.</p><br/><p>After a brief pause, Shasuryu spoke again.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut there is no need to fear! For the first time in our history, the Five Tribes have come together as one! Through our alliance, we are now one tribe! Therefore, the ancestors of the Five Tribes will watch over us \u2014\u200b even the spirits from other tribes will protect us!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPriests!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this command, Crusch stepped forward, at the head of the priests from the Five tribes, and then she shucked her clothing to reveal her white scales.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is Crusch Lulu, the leader of the High Priests!\u201d</p><br/><p>Crusch took another step forward as Shasuryu called her by name.</p><br/><p>\u201cSummon the ancestors upon us!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014\u200bListen well, children of the Great Tribe!\u201d</p><br/><p>How would this newly-formed tribe turn out?</p><br/><p>With an iron determination in her voice, Crusch went on and on. At times her voice was high-pitched, at times it was low-pitched, at times it sounded like she was growling, and at times it sounded like she was singing.</p><br/><p>At first, almost everyone was repulsed by Crusch the albino. However, after seeing her unwavering confidence, that distaste gradually vanished.</p><br/><p>Crusch\u2019s body swayed gently as she spoke, Her white scales glittered in the light of the bonfire \u2014\u200b the reflected light making it seem as though the spirits of the ancestors had descended upon Crusch.</p><br/><p>There were looks of worshipful awe on everyone\u2019s faces.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that the Five Tribes are one, it means the spirits of the Five Tribes will protect us all! Behold, ladies and gentlemen! Witness the advent of the numberless ancestors through the generations as they take their place beside you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Crusch forcefully cast open her arms and pointed to the sky. Everyone looked up, but all they saw was an expanse of ordinary night sky. There was no spirits descending or anything.</p><br/><p>However, someone muttered something.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there a light there?\u201d</p><br/><p>The faint voice grew louder, and several Lizardmen added, \u201cI see it.\u201d Someone said they saw a faint light, someone shouted about a Lizardmen, someone muttered about a gigantic fish, someone exclaimed that there was a child there, and someone muttered incredulously about an egg.</p><br/><p>There was only one thing within the hearts of the Lizardmen \u2014\u200b that the spirits of their ancestors really were with them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe spirits have come to protect us!\u201d</p><br/><p>Thus, it only made sense that someone shouted exactly that.</p><br/><p>\u201cFeel it! Feel their power entering your bodies!\u201d</p><br/><p>Crusch\u2019s voice seemed to speak directly to their souls. It sounded like it was coming from a faraway place and very close by at the same time.</p><br/><p>As the Lizardmen heard her voice, they felt some kind of strength filling them.</p><br/><p>\u201cFeel it! Feel the strength which the ancestors of the Five Tribes have gifted you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Now, all the Lizardmen here definitely felt it.</p><br/><p>They could feel the intense power within them. This sense of hot-bloodedness wiped away their prior unease; their bodies glowed from within with warmth, as though they had just drunk wine.</p><br/><p>This was certain proof that the spirits of the ancestors had descended to the mortal realm.</p><br/><p>Crusch turned her eyes away from the crowd of intoxicated-looking Lizardmen, and nodded to Shasuryu.</p><br/><p>\u201cHear me, all you Lizardmen. The ancestors are now with us. The enemy outnumbers us, but will we lose?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><br/><p>The air shook as the Lizardmen \u2014\u200b with vaguely drunken looks on their faces \u2014\u200b answered Shasuryu in unison.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! Now that the spirits of the ancestors are with us, there\u2019s no way we can lose! Let us defeat the foe and offer this victory to them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOhhhhh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s morale was through the roof. In place of the uneasy Lizardmen from earlier were now warriors hungry for battle.</p><br/><p>This was not the effect of charm magic. Even with this many druids, they did not have the luxury of casting spells on everyone here before the battle started.</p><br/><p>Rather, this was the result of the special beverage the Lizardmen had drunk before this ceremony began.</p><br/><p>Said beverage was a recipe passed down through the generations, which gave its drinkers courage. It was made with herbs which induced a brief period of intoxication, euphoria, and hallucinations in those who consumed it.</p><br/><p>The net result was a state of altered perception.</p><br/><p>Crusch\u2019s spiel had been intended to buy time for the effects to kick in.</p><br/><p>When one knew the truth, it hardly seemed impressive at all. However, for the people witnessing this spectacle with their own eyes \u2014\u200b in other words, the Lizardmen who saw the proof that their ancestors were walking with them \u2014\u200b this ritual ignited the courage within them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, we shall begin applying the warpaint. Originally, every tribe would have their own color, but now that the spirits of the Five tribes reside within us all, we shall use the colors of each tribe for everyone!\u201d</p><br/><p>Several priests took up clay pots and walked among the Lizardmen.</p><br/><p>The Lizardmen decorated themselves using the paint from the pots. They believed that the ancestor spirits within them were guiding their hands, so they let their fingertips wander freely, tracing designs all over their bodies.</p><br/><p>Many of them painted their entire bodies, possibly thanks to this \u201cadvent.\u201d However, almost none of the Green Claw Lizardmen applied paint to themselves. This was because Zaryusu, Shasuryu and the elite members of the tribes had not done so. In other words, it was a form of idol worship.</p><br/><p>After looking around and satisfying himself that everyone was done, Zaryusu drew his greatsword and pointed it at the village gate.</p><br/><p>\u201cForward march!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOhhhhhh\u2014\u200b!\u201d</p><br/><p>Countless roars rang through the air.</p><br/><p><b>Part 3</b></p><br/><p>The troops from the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick were divided into two groups and stationed in the swamp.</p><br/><p>The Zombie division was on the Lizardmen\u2019s left flank, while the Skeleton division was on their right. The Skeleton Archers and Skeleton Riders were stationed behind the other Skeletons.</p><br/><p>The Beast Zombies were kept in the rear, as though they were a command company.</p><br/><p>The Lizardmen facing them were also divided into two forces, despite their comparatively thin numbers. The hunters and the females were on the Zombies\u2019 side, while the males and warriors were on the Skeletons\u2019 side. Meanwhile, the priests remained within the village, defended by the walls.</p><br/><p>The Lizardmen had come out of the village because they knew that there was no point in laying up for a siege. There was no help coming for them, and the walls were anything but sturdy. In addition, the enemy was an army of the dead, who did not need rations or rest.</p><br/><p>Given these deeply unfavorable circumstances, a siege was a very bad idea.</p><br/><p>However, once the Lizardmen had formed up outside, they keenly understood the tremendous disparity between their forces and those of the enemy.</p><br/><p>A situation where one faced three could still be compared to that of ten facing thirty. But if one thousand had to fight three thousand, the vast difference in their respective strengths became very apparent. Even if three thousand undead beings did nothing but stand in ranks, they were still a very intimidating sight.</p><br/><p>Despite the circumstances, the Lizardmen did not show any signs of fear. Their ancestors were with them now \u2014\u200b numbers counted for nothing to them.</p><br/><p>Soon, the undead forces began a slow advance. The Zombies and Skeletons began to move, while the Skeleton Archers and Skeleton Riders remained where they stood. Perhaps they were being held in reserve.</p><br/><p>The Lizardmen advanced as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cOHHHHHH!\u201d</p><br/><p>The wetlands echoed with an ear-piercing shout, accompanied by the sound of countless splashes. Water was churned into foam and dirt flew everywhere.</p><br/><p>The two armies continued advancing, until they were on the verge of a ferocious clash. However, an abnormality arose in the Nazarick army.</p><br/><p>The Zombies and the Skeletons had begun their advance together, but as they moved forward, they gradually drew apart. This was because the Zombies were slow while the Skeletons were swift. In addition, the wetlands were very difficult terrain.</p><br/><p>When slow monsters like Zombies were mired down in mud, their movements became even slower. However, agile monsters like Skeletons were not as badly affected.</p><br/><p>Therefore, the first engagement was between the Skeletons and the Lizardmen warriors.</p><br/><p>The Lizardmen employed no formations, simply crashing into the Skeletons. There was no art in their technique; they simply swung whenever they saw an enemy.</p><br/><p>Leading the way were the five Head Warriors of the various tribes. To some extent, it was foolish for a commander to lead from the front. However, they were the highest ranked warriors of their respective tribes, and morale would suffer if they did not fight at the head of their troops. Instead, the Lizardmen were all in high spirits.</p><br/><p>They were backed by eighty nine armored warriors from the Razor Tail tribe. They wore hide armor and carried hide shields, and they possessed the highest defensive strength of any group among the tribes.</p><br/><p>They raised their shields, charging the Skeleton horde as a single, united wall.</p><br/><p>Then, they clashed \u2014\u200b the vanguards of the Skeletons and the Lizardmen colliding with each other.</p><br/><p>In that moment, countless bones flew in all directions, and the Lizardman squadron tore into the Skeleton horde.</p><br/><p>The sounds of carnage shook the heavens and the sounds of bone crunching seemed endless. There were occasional cries of pain, but those were drowned out by the sounds of shattering bone.</p><br/><p>The Lizardmen had an incontestable advantage in this first engagement, and the tide of battle favored them.</p><br/><p>If the combatants were not Lizardmen, but humans, the opposite would probably be the case.</p><br/><p>Skeletons were made of bones, so piercing weapons were almost completely ineffective against them while they resisted slashing weapons to a certain extend. Therefore, human troops \u2014\u200b who used blades and swords as their primary weapons \u2014\u200b would have a hard time damaging those Skeletons.</p><br/><p>The advantage of the Lizardmen stemmed from the fact that they used crude maces and clubs as their primary weapons, which inflicted bludgeoning damage \u2014\u200b the bane of Skeletons.</p><br/><p>The Lizardmen easily crushed the bony bodies of the Skeletons with every swing of their weapons. Even if they survived one hit, the second would pulverize them. In contrast, the rusty longswords that the Skeletons used were deflected by the tough scales and hides of the Lizardmen. While some of them were hurt, nobody sustained any fatal wounds.</p><br/><p>This was the first charge.</p><br/><p>Almost five hundred Skeletons lay in fragments from that clash alone.</p><br/><p>\u2666 \u2666 \u2666</p><br/><p>Cocytus\u2019s jaw dropped as he stared at the vision within the mirror.</p><br/><p>This was only the first time they had stood toe to toe, but the strength of the Lizardmen had exceeded his expectations. As an excellent warrior himself, Cocytus possessed a degree of insight into the strength of his enemy.</p><br/><p>It was true that as individuals, the Skeletons were clearly weaker than the Lizardmen and they had no hope of victory. However, their numbers should have compensated for that weakness.</p><br/><p>Even so, this outcome had taken place. What was the meaning of this? It made him wonder if they Lizardmen had been strengthened by some other power.</p><br/><p>In all likelihood, only the Skeleton Archers and Skeleton Riders could claim victory over the Lizardmen as they were now.</p><br/><p>The Skeletons crumbled one after the other as he watched the battle. The Skeletons and Zombies would probably only serve to sap their opponents\u2019 stamina.</p><br/><p><i>At this rate, the only effective troops we have are the three hundred Beast Zombies, the one hundred fifty Skeleton Archers, and the five hundred Skeleton Riders. The weight of numbers is now against us.</i></p><br/><p>Cocytus calculated the odds in his mind. .</p><br/><p>The undead were strong, especially in extended battles; almost nobody could beat them at that. The undead did not feel anything \u2014\u200b not fear, not pain, not fatigue, or the need for sleep.</p><br/><p>The advantages those characteristics bestowed in warfare hardly needed to be stated.</p><br/><p>For instance, if one swung a mace at the head of a living creature, there was a high chance said creature would die, or if it survived, it would bleed profusely and suffer great pain. The person receiving the attack would naturally lose the will to fight. Of course, an exception had to be made for warriors who had been trained to endure great pain, but most people would not want to fight on.</p><br/><p>That was a perfectly natural reaction from living beings.</p><br/><p>But what about the undead?</p><br/><p>Crack their skulls? They would continue attacking while they leaked their brains with every blow.</p><br/><p>Break their arms? They would keep attacking with their shattered limbs.</p><br/><p>Chop off their legs? They would crawl to launch the next attack.</p><br/><p>Indeed, as long as the negative energy which served as their lifeforce was not depleted, the undead would keep fighting. As long as the conditions for instant death were not met \u2014\u200b decapitation was quite a common one for most low tier undead beings \u2014\u200b they would not lose the will to fight like humans would. In other words, the undead were perfect soldiers.</p><br/><p>It could not be denied that the Lizardmen were currently superior, going by individual strength. However, that state of affairs might not carry one.</p><br/><p>Cocytus\u2019s opinion of the Lizardmen went up by a notch, and he concluded that they were not a foe which could be instantly destroyed. That being the case, he had to draw out the battle.</p><br/><p>\u201cShould. We. Pull. Back. And. Wait. For. A. Chance. To. Launch. Another. Attack?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour servant feels that would be the wisest move.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour servant is of the opinion that it would be better to mobilize the archers and cavalry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no, we should continue the attack until the enemy is exhausted.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut what good does it do to exhaust the foe? If we cannot smash their headquarters, the enemy will eventually recover their strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed. The enemy seems to have a strong defense, but they are hiding behind those fragile walls. What about taking the village and then encircling them?\u201d</p><br/><p>After listening to his servants\u2019 responses, Cocytus picked up the \u300cMessage\u300d scroll and glanced at Entoma, trying to read her expression.</p><br/><p>Entoma looked disinterestedly at the mirror. She produced a green biscuit from somewhere and brought it to her chin, and soon, the sounds of crunching echoed through the room. That attitude seemed to be saying that she was unconcerned about the events that were unfolding. Perhaps that was why she had no expression on her face.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u200bNo, that expressionless face was nothing more than a decoration.</p><br/><p>Cocytus thought about her true nature, and realised that trying to read her expression was a foolish gesture.</p><br/><p>She was a Familiar Eater. Even Cocytus\u2019s friend, Kyouhukou of the Five Worsts in Nazarick, had bluntly stated that \u201cshe is a most frightening person.\u201d That was her true nature.</p><br/><p>Cocytus abandoned the plan of trying to divine her thoughts by reading her face and unfurled the scroll, sending a \u300cMessage\u300d to the army\u2019s commander.</p><br/><p>\u2666 \u2666 \u2666</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014\u200bAre they looking down on us?\u201d Zenberu muttered. He did so quietly, but it was still loud enough that everyone watching the enemy from the wall could hear it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t mobilizing their archers or cavalry. That makes me think that they\u2019re looking down on us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I thought they\u2019d come at us all at once\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cZombie fight, going well.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were only forty five hunters fighting the zombies. They launched hit and run attacks with thrown stones, slowly drawing the Zombies away from the Skeletons. The females slowly moved to a position where they could flank the Skeletons.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think their movements are very suspicious?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Indeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Zombies were not so much diverted as completely distracted by the hunters. Would any commander permit such movements? No, it should not have been possible, yet the Zombies were moving as described. That being the case, what did the enemy have in mind? Nobody present had any idea.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t quite understand what they\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, I\u2019m with Shasuryu.\u201d</p><br/><p>No matter how hard thought about it, they did not feel there was any particular significance to the Zombies\u2019 movements.</p><br/><p>After observing for a while longer, Zaryusu shared his thoughts with the others.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be that there\u2019s no commander?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo commander\u2026? Ah, do you mean to say that the undead have been acting on the orders they were given at the beginning of the battle?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The lowest tiered undead like Zombies and Skeletons did not possess intelligence. Therefore, giving them orders at the appropriate moment was the best way of commanding them. However, the Zombies and other enemies seemed to have received orders to kill any nearby Lizardmen. That was what they were getting at.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn other words, the enemy thought they could beat us by sheer weight of numbers\u2026 no, could it be that this battle is just to see how well they can fight without a commander?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeems that way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBastards! Are they fucking with us!?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was Shasuryu, not Zenberu, who was cursing. Even Shasuryu could not tolerate this sort of thing. After all, the Lizardmen were all betting their lives on this.</p><br/><p>\u201cCalm down, Shasuryu. We don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the case yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, sorry\u2026 though I guess it\u2019s good that we\u2019re doing well so far.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAni-ja, you\u2019re right, because we need to cut down the enemies\u2019 numbers as much as possible right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Battle was a very fatiguing activity, and a pitched melee was unimaginably taxing on one\u2019s mental strength. On a battlefield where one did not know if the enemy would be coming from the front, rear, left, or right, merely swinging one\u2019s weapon a few times was several times more exhausting than normal.</p><br/><p>However, the undead did not feel fatigue, and they would continue attacking without respite.</p><br/><p>This was the difference between the living and the dead, and as time went by, that difference would become more and more apparent.</p><br/><p>In other words, time was the Lizardmen\u2019s enemy.</p><br/><p>\u201cCheh, it would be fine if only I could fight\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPatience, Zenberu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Indeed, if a mighty warrior like Zenberu took the field, they could probably wipe out the Skeletons in moments. However, that would mean revealing their ace in the hole. Zaryusu\u2019s group of half a dozen people was their secret weapon. While they would obviously need to play their trump card in times of emergency, they could not reveal their true power as as long as the situation was not dire and if their greatest foe had not shown up yet.</p><br/><p>\u201cStill, if the enemy doesn\u2019t advance, doesn\u2019t that play right into our hands?\u201d Zaryusu told the others, who responded in the affirmative. Then, he turned to Crusch and asked, \u201cAre things still okay on your side?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Yes, and the ritual\u2019s going well too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Crusch answered Zaryusu\u2019s question as she looked around the village. The ritual which the priests were conducting in the village might well be another trump card for the Lizardmen. Normally, it would have taken a very long time, but since all the priests of all the tribes were gathered together, it was progressing at a tremendous pace, quickly enough to be used in this battle.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo this is the power of cooperation\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm\u2026 yes. Granted, we did share some insights after that war in the past\u2026 Still, there\u2019s a lot of things I want to do after the war now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other chiefs nodded vigorously at Shasuryu\u2019s suggestion. They had shared a lot of knowledge thanks to this battle, and they had seen with their own eyes the importance of everyone working together towards a common goal. The three chiefs who had allied in the past but not exchanged information were particularly forceful in their agreement.</p><br/><p>Zaryusu looked at those five people, and smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I just felt really happy despite our circumstances.\u201d</p><br/><p>Crusch immediately picked up on what he was thinking.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014\u200bMe too, Zaryusu.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he looked on the smiling Crusch, Zaryusu\u2019s eyes narrowed as though she were shining. They had looks of admiration and kindness in their eyes.</p><br/><p>It was only natural that they were not embracing. After all, they could not indulge their desires while Lizardmen were dying before them. However, Zaryusu\u2019s and Crusch\u2019s tails seemed like independent creatures as they twitched, occasionally touching and separating.</p><br/><p>\u201cMuuu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know what this situation is, as an older brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been completely shut out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAw, they really do love each other.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn short\u2026 good to be young, future is bright.\u201d</p><br/><p>The four older Lizardmen nodded as they looked on their adorable juniors.</p><br/><p>Of course, there was no way Crusch and Zaryusu could not have heard that. Their tails moved and twitched without pause, but they had serious and proper expressions on their faces.</p><br/><p>\u201cAni-ja, the enemy\u2019s making their move.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shasuryu and the other chiefs could not help but smile bitterly at the sudden change in Zaryusu\u2019s attitude. At the same time, they cast their eyes toward the enemy formation. The Skeleton Riders were advancing <i>en masse</i>.</p><br/><p>\u201cOi oi oi, don\u2019t tell me they\u2019re heading for us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe cavalry? Are they planning to shake our morale by striking directly at us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, they should be planning to circle around the warriors and the males and then flank them, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>This was bad.</p><br/><p>Everyone came to the same conclusion without saying a word. The mobility of the Skeleton Riders was hard to deal with.</p><br/><p>If the Skeleton Riders had moved out at the beginning of the battle, they would have prioritized their destruction. However, the warriors and the male Lizardmen were currently locked in melee combat, the hunters were drawing off the Zombies, and the females were flanking the Skeletons with thrown rocks, so there was precious little manpower left to block the Skeleton Riders.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like it\u2019ll be better if we make the first move.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shasuryu nodded after the Small Fang tribe\u2019s chief spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe question now is who we should send out\u2026 or rather, who we should allow to fight first\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2666 \u2666 \u2666</p><br/><p>Skeleton Riders.</p><br/><p>They were lance-wielding Skeletons mounted on Skeletal Horses. They had no special characteristics beyond their enhanced mobility, but said mobility was outstanding on this marshy terrain. Their bodies were made of bone and would not sink too deeply into the mud, which meant that they could advance at the speed of a regular horse.</p><br/><p>Nearly a hundred Skeleton Riders were moving forward, intent on circling around behind the Lizardmen to destroy them from behind.</p><br/><p>They saw three Lizardmen approaching from their front and left \u2014\u200b in other words, from the village \u2014\u200b but the Skeleton Riders paid them no heed. They had not received orders to engage them, so they would ignore them as long as they did not attack. Unintelligent undead were such creatures.</p><br/><p>Just as they were about to reach the rear of the Lizardman forces, the leading Skeleton Rider\u2019s world was suddenly flipped and turned upside down. The horseman flew far into the air and crashed heavily to the marsh.</p><br/><p>A human would have been confused and been unable to act. However, the Skeleton Rider was an unintelligent undead being, and it immediately continued moving to fulfill its orders.</p><br/><p>Though it rose quickly, it had been injured, and so it moved with a bit of a limp.</p><br/><p>Just then, it was hit by another unhorsed Skeleton Rider, and the shattered bones of the two Skeleton Riders were scattered all over the marsh.</p><br/><p>Scenes like this were happening everywhere.</p><br/><p>Why had something like this happened on the wide-open wetlands? The answer was simple \u2014\u200b it was a trap.</p><br/><p>There had been open wooden boxes buried in the marsh, and when the Skeleton Horses stepped into them, they had fallen.</p><br/><p>The Skeleton Riders fell one after the other. If they were humans, they would have slowed their pace. However, the Skeleton Riders would not do that. While they had enough judgement to avoid a hole they were aware of, they had no ability to be wary of traps. This was because they had no orders to do so, and no intelligence to allow them to adapt to the situation.</p><br/><p>Their headlong rush into the traps looked like a form of mass suicide.</p><br/><p>Still, while the traps were very effective, they were ultimately only a delaying measure. They could inflict some damage, but they could not eliminate the Skeleton Riders by themselves. The fallen Skeleton Riders rose to their feet, covered in mud.</p><br/><p>Just then, there was a whoosh and the sound of the air parting. Just like that, one of the fallen Skeleton Riders had its head knocked off.</p><br/><p>The Skeleton Riders judged this to be enemy action, and looked around.</p><br/><p>Just then, another Skeleton Rider\u2019s head flew off its shoulders, shattered like a glass marble.</p><br/><p>The Skeleton Riders spotted three Lizardmen about eighty meters away from them. They also saw them launching stones from the slings in their hands, crushing the skulls of the Skeleton Riders\u2014\u200b</p><br/><p>The Skeleton Riders began moving.</p><br/><p>\u2666 \u2666 \u2666</p><br/><p>At the same time, the battle situation with the Skeletons began to change.</p><br/><p>After the sound of countless bowstrings being pulled taut, the sound of arrows filled the air like the falling of rain.</p><br/><p>The one hundred fifty Skeleton Archers fired at the melee with the Skeletons and the Lizardmen. They did not just discharge one arrow each, but two, three\u2026</p><br/><p>The Lizardmen had not expected an arrow storm like that.</p><br/><p>Many Lizardmen were hit by arrows and collapsed. They could not fight the Skeletons and block the arrow attacks at the same time.</p><br/><p>Of course, the Skeletons were hit by the arrows as well, but they were not hurt.</p><br/><p>Using the Skeletons \u2014\u200b who were nigh-immune to piercing damage \u2014\u200b as screens and then having the Skeleton Archers fire from behind them was a near-perfect strategy. They would have enough time to wipe out all the Lizardmen in the time it would take to bash through the two thousand Skeletons screening them.</p><br/><p>The problem was that they had used that tactic too late. If they had opened with that move, the fate of the Lizardmen would have been sealed. They would have been drowned under the overwhelming tide of enemy forces and victory would have been decided. However, the outcome of the battle was largely decided by this point.</p><br/><p>The Lizardmen ignored the skeletons Skeletons, and charged the Skeleton Archers in the rear.</p><br/><p>One hundred fifty arrows fell like rain, and several Lizardmen hit the ground as a result. Yet, that was only a small portion of their forces.</p><br/><p>The Lizardmen had thick skin and strong scales, so even without armor, they had the same defensive strength as humans in leather armor. Even if an arrow somehow pierced their hides, their thick layer of muscles kept them alive.</p><br/><p>In addition, the Skeleton Archers did not have much strength behind their draws. That was another reason why they could not kill the Lizardmen.</p><br/><p>The Lizardmen roared fearlessly as they charged. They crossed their arms over their heads as the arrow storm fell upon them, and even if they were impaled by the shafts, they continued regardless.</p><br/><p>Three arrows \u2014\u200b</p><br/><p>This was the most each of the Skeleton Archers managed to loose. If they had any intelligence, they would have fallen back. It would have been better if they retreated for the moment and then regrouped to engage the surviving undead troops.</p><br/><p>However, the Skeletons\u2019 minds could not process such complicated orders, and such orders had not been given anyway. Therefore, they could only do as they had been told \u2014\u200b keep firing on the Lizardmen even if they get close.</p><br/><p>There was a mighty roar \u2014\u200b and then the Skeletons and Skeleton Archers alike drowned under the rising tide of Lizardmen. The Skeleton Archers could no longer show their stuff at this range. Their part was to be punching bags for their enemies, and so they fell steadily, in twos and threes.</p><br/><p>Currently, the Zombies were still alive, but the Skeletons had been almost completely beaten into the ground.</p><br/><p>This was when the enemy sent out new foes.</p><br/><p>Those were the Beast Zombies.</p><br/><p>These monsters \u2014\u200b made from the corpses of wolves, snakes, pythons, and other such creatures \u2014\u200b combined the strength of Zombies and the agility of wild animals.</p><br/><p>The Beast Zombies ran at the Lizardmen. The swift ones surged ahead while the slow ones lagged behind; it was a ragged charge with no formation to speak of.</p><br/><p>Attacks from below were unexpectedly hard to avoid. The Beast Zombies would tear at their foes\u2019 legs and finish them off once they were immobilized. It was a truly savage combat technique.</p><br/><p>The increasingly fatigued Lizardmen had a hard time warding off these attacks. Several Lizardmen were too slow to avoid having their throats torn out by the Beast Zombies. After seeing their comrades fall, even the ones who had steeled themselves for combat or believed in ancestral protection could not hide the looks of fear on their faces.</p><br/><p>The Head Warriors had led their men into the bloody fray, but now they were gradually being forced back. Just as they thought the line of battle would eventually break, the ground before them swelled.</p><br/><p>Before them appeared two armless and legless lumps of mud, around one hundred sixty centimeters tall.</p><br/><p>The two clumps of mud began moving.</p><br/><p>They had no legs, but they moved adroitly and smoothly over the wetlands, towards the Beast Zombies. After closing the distance, the mud-clumps sprouted whips that were longer than them from the places where a human\u2019s arms would have been.</p><br/><p>This was one of the trump cards of the Lizardmen, the Swamp Spirits summoned by the combined efforts of all the priests.</p><br/><p>The Swamp Spirits charged into the Beast Zombies and attacked with their tentacle-like whip arms, seizing the enemy. Naturally, the Beast Zombies fearlessly counterattacked, slashing with claws and tearing with fangs.</p><br/><p>This was a battle between beings that knew no fear. However, the tide turned in favor of the Swamp Spirits, purely because of the difference between their fighting strengths.</p><br/><p>The power of their priests had defeated the unliving. This fact rekindled the Lizardmen\u2019s courage, and they rallied for another charge.</p><br/><p>A brutal battle ensued.</p><br/><p>Unlike the previous fight with the Skeletons, the Lizardmen began to take casualties. However, victory was at hand for the Lizardmen, who had the advantage of numbers.</p><br/><p>\u2666 \u2666 \u2666</p><br/><p><i>We will lose.</i></p><br/><p>Cocytus understood that much.</p><br/><p>There were no intelligent undead among the forces he had been assigned. That was the main cause of their defeat, and something which had worried him from the start, but he had not expected them to be that weak.</p><br/><p>Cocytus\u2019s head ached at his naivete. While there was a way to turn the tables in a situation like this, he did not favor it much, because making that move was tantamount to admitting defeat.</p><br/><p>Still, how could he report failure to his master? Cocytus picked up the \u300cMessage\u300d scroll. Who should he send this message to\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Demiurge?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300eIndeed it is, old friend. Why would you contact me? Has something happened?\u300f</p><br/><p>A calm, even voice spoke in Cocytus\u2019s mind. Demiurge\u2019s intelligence was top class in Nazarick. Surely he would have an idea for a situation like this.</p><br/><p>On a certain level, Demiurge could also be considered a rival of his, so Cocytus was not too happy about asking him for help. Still, the most important thing was to avoid defeat. How could the armies of the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick be beaten in battle? He was willing to cast aside his pride and bow before others for help in order to avoid that outcome.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually\u2014\u200b\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing a scroll\u2019s worth of explanation about the current situation, Demiurge \u2014\u200b who had been listening quietly \u2014\u200b sighed in exasperation.</p><br/><p>\u300eThen, what do you want me to do?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201cI. Hope. You. Can. Help. Me. Think. Of. Something. If. This. Carries. On. We. Will. Be. Defeated. I. Can. Accept. A. Personal. Defeat. But. I. Cannot. Allow. The. Great. Tomb. Of. Nazarick. \u2014\u200b The. Supreme. Beings. \u2014\u200b To. Be. Disgraced. In. Such. A. Way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026Do you think Ainz-sama truly wishes for victory?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat. Do. You. Mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300eI am saying, why do you think Ainz-sama picked out such low tier fodder for an army?\u300f</p><br/><p>Cocytus had harbored his doubts about that point. He had no idea what reason could warrant drafting the dregs of Nazarick into a fighting force.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Ainz-sama. Must. Have. His. Own. Motives. But. What. Could. They. Be?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026There are several possibilities that come to mind.\u300f</p><br/><p><i>That\u2019s Demiurge for you</i> \u2014\u200b Cocytus did not say that, though his respect for the demon grew in silence.</p><br/><p>\u300eLet me ask you something, Cocytus. You\u2019ve been there for several days now. Don\u2019t you think you should have gathered intelligence on the Lizardmen?\u300f</p><br/><p>He was right. However\u2014\u200b</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Ainz-sama ordered me to defeat the foe with that force, in a head-on confrontation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300eThat is indeed the case, but I hope you will think carefully on it, Cocytus. The important thing is what sort of results you will show Ainz-sama, am I wrong? If exterminating the village was the objective, then you should have considered the ideal methods for extermination, don\u2019t you think?\u300f</p><br/><p>Cocytus had nothing to say, because Demiurge had hit the nail on the head.</p><br/><p>\u300eAinz-sama must have assigned you those servants because he had that in mind.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026You. Mean. To. Say. That. Ainz-sana, Deliberately. Assigned. Me. Inadequate. Troops?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300eThe possibility is very high. If you had researched the village beforehand, perhaps you would have known that your forces would be insufficient to conquer the village. In that event, you would have told Ainz-sama that, \u2018Exterminating the village will be difficult with these forces, I wish to request reinforcements.\u2019 That was most likely Ainz-sama\u2019s objective.\u300f</p><br/><p>In other words, Demiurge was trying to say that Cocytus had to divine his master\u2019s intent and adapt his methods to the situation, not follow orders blindly.</p><br/><p>\u300eThis seems to be one of Ainz-sama\u2019s plans to improve the way in which we approach matters, but he seems to have other objectives in mind as well\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201cOther. Objectives?\u201d Cocytus hurriedly asked Demiurge. He had already erred once, and he did not wish to further add to his mistakes.</p><br/><p>\u300eAinz-sama sent messengers to the village, but he did not state Nazarick\u2019s name at all. In addition, he ordered you not to take the field. That being the case\u2014\u200b\u300f</p><br/><p>Cocytus gulped as he waited for Demiurge to continue speaking. However, Demiurge did not.</p><br/><p>\u300eCocytus! Forgive me, something urgent has cropped up. I apologise, but let\u2019s leave our conversation here. Good luck.\u300f</p><br/><p>Demiurge\u2019s words cut off and the \u300cMessage\u300d ended.</p><br/><p>As Cocytus wondered what would panic a calm person like him, his gaze shifted to someone else seated at a table within the room. He saw Entoma peeling a tattered talisman from her forehead and casting it down.</p><br/><p>If she, a talismancer, was using a talisman, that meant\u2014\u200b</p><br/><p>It was too late for anything else.</p><br/><p>That being the case, now was the time to deploy the final undead being, his trump card. However, would that really fulfill his master\u2019s aims?</p><br/><p>This might be the first time Cocytus had contemplated his master\u2019s true underlying motives. However, there was only one conclusion he could reach.</p><br/><p>Cocytus cast the \u300cMessage\u300d spell.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014\u200bHeed me, Elder Lich commander. Attack and show the Lizardmen your power.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2666 \u2666 \u2666</p><br/><p>The bony body \u2014\u200b dressed in a luxurious but timeworn set of robes \u2014\u200b clutched a gnarled staff in one of its hand. Its skin was a thin layer stretched over the skull underneath and it was beginning to rot, and it bore a malevolent intelligence within its eyes. Its body radiated negative energy like a mist which shrouded it.</p><br/><p>This undead magic caster was the Elder Lich in question.</p><br/><p>After receiving its orders, the undead creature looked over the marsh. Then, it turned to the Bloodmeat Hulks \u2014\u200b undead creatures that were masses of red skin and muscle \u2014\u200b behind it. To these fellow creations of the same Supreme Being, he gave an order:</p><br/><p>\u201cKill those three Lizardmen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon receipt of those orders, the two Bloodmeat Hulks lumbered out towards the three Lizardmen who were devastating the Skeleton Riders.</p><br/><p>While the Bloodmeat Hulks were low tier undead who could only attack with brute strength, they possessed the power of regeneration. As a result, it would take a long time to bring them down with physical attacks on their level.</p><br/><p>The Elder Lich felt that the Bloodmeat Hulks could buy him enough time.</p><br/><p>This could be considered a foolish strategy. The Elder Lich was a magic caster and not used to melee combat, so under normal circumstances, it would have been better to keep the Bloodmeat Hulks by his side.</p><br/><p>However, he could not do that now.</p><br/><p>His orders were to \u201cShow the Lizardmen your power.\u201d Therefore, he had to proceed alone and destroy the Lizardman headquarters with his overwhelming might.</p><br/><p>The Elder Lich advanced. Its face twisted into a fearsome shape as it chuckled.</p><br/><p>He felt that this was a piece of cake.</p><br/><p>He had been personally made by the Supreme Being Ainz Ooal Gown, and he was far superior to the automatically-spawning Elder Liches in Nazarick. And now, his task was to demonstrate his puissance to the Lizardmen.</p><br/><p>He swore to achieve victory by the name his master had given him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, Igva, shall dedicate this triumph to my liege.\u201d</p><br/><p><b>Part</b><b>4</b></p><br/><p>After wiping out the Beast Zombies, the Lizardmen rounded their shoulders in fatigue and breathed sighs of relief. There was anguish on their faces, but at the same time there were faint smiles there.</p><br/><p>It was true that they had taken many casualties, but they were lucky only to have sustained that much. If the Swamp Spirits had not joined the fight\u2026 no, if they had come in just a little later, their formation would have collapsed and it would have turned into a rout.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re moving out,\u201d shouted the Head Warriors. It was an announcement that they were heading into battle.</p><br/><p>Their bodies were weak from fatigue, and just raising their weapons consumed a great deal of effort, to say nothing of actually wielding them. They were bone-tired, but the battle was not yet over.</p><br/><p>They had to beware the enemy\u2019s reinforcements even as they eliminated the distant Zombies.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll right, get the heavily wounded back to the village, the rest of you form up on us\u2014\u200b\u201d</p><br/><p>The sound of roaring fire interrupted him.</p><br/><p>Searing heat engulfed the surroundings, and the Swamp Spirits at the center of the blaze wavered.</p><br/><p>As the flames vanished like they had never been there in the first place, the two Spirits were in terrible shape. A single gout of fire had half-destroyed them.</p><br/><p>Before the Lizardmen could cry out in surprise, the fires raged once more. The Spirits could not endure the attacks and disintegrated into the roaring inferno.</p><br/><p>As the Swamp Spirits \u2014\u200b who had demonstrated incredible power against the Beast Zombies \u2014\u200b disappeared without a trace, the Lizardmen\u2019s faces went blank, unable to keep pace with what was happening before them.</p><br/><p><i>What had just happened?</i></p><br/><p>They knew that the Swamp Spirits had been destroyed, but they were desperately trying to deny that reality. That was because if the Swamp Spirits really had been destroyed, it meant that there was a more powerful monster headed their way.</p><br/><p>The Lizardmen looked around in confusion and also to hide their fear. Just as they spotted an undead being in the distance, a fireball once more flew from its hand.</p><br/><p>The head-sized ball of flame soared through the air in a straight line and flew into the leader squad of the Lizardman troops.</p><br/><p>Under normal circumstances, flames would vanish upon contact with water. However, this fireball was a magical phenomenon and defied that logic. When the fireball touched the water, it was as though it had struck a hard surface. A roaring cyclone of flame blossomed from the point of impact.</p><br/><p>The fiery explosion consumed several Lizardmen \u2014\u200b and then faded away.</p><br/><p><i>Was this an illusion?</i> \u2014\u200b that thought vanished in an instant. The smell of charred meat wafting in the air and the bodies of Lizardmen slumped on the ground was real enough.</p><br/><p>The undead creature advanced with unhurried steps, so elegant that one might take it for arrogance. That was the stride of a mighty being, fully confident in its power.</p><br/><p>As the Lizardmen hesitated about whether they should rush it with an all-out attack, just like how they had destroyed the Skeleton Archers, another fireball flew at them.</p><br/><p>The fireball exploded violently, claiming the lives of all the Lizardmen around it in an instant.</p><br/><p>This was overwhelming power. It made people think that everything which had happened just now was little more than a game.</p><br/><p>\u201cUooooohh!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Lizardmen shouted to clear the fear from their hearts. Just as several Lizardmen charged recklessly ahead, a cold, clear voice spoke from what seemed like an unthinkably great distance:</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014\u200bUtter foolishness.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was all their foe said. The onrushing Lizardmen were incinerated by a ball of flame before they could scream.</p><br/><p>The undead being took a step forward, and over a hundred Lizardmen immediately took one step back. The disparity between their powers was like a high wall which forced the Lizardmen to retreat.</p><br/><p>\u201cRun away!\u201d</p><br/><p>A strident, electrifying cry filled the air. The voice belonged to one of the Head Warriors.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat one\u2019s different from the ones before him! We can\u2019t take him!\u201d</p><br/><p>That much was true. The majestic sight of the Elder Lich slowly advancing by itself was an awesome one. It made the Lizardmen feel as though a mighty wind was blowing across their skin.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo inform the chiefs and Zaryusu about this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll try to buy time!\u201d</p><br/><p>Another fireball exploded, and several more Lizardmen lay upon the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cRun! Go tell them!\u201d</p><br/><p>The five Head Warriors ordered the Lizardmen to flee, and at the same time they judged the distance between them. They were spacing themselves out so even when a fireball burst, at least one of them would be able to close the gap to the enemy. It was a suicidal tactic designed to accomplish that objective.</p><br/><p>After spreading themselves out, the five of them looked at each other, and then sprinted.</p><br/><p>The enemy was roughly one hundred meters away. They despaired at the distance separating them, but even so, they ran with all their might. That was because even if they perished halfway, their deaths would still give the chiefs and Zaryusu information they could use.</p><br/><p>\u2666 \u2666 \u2666</p><br/><p>The Lizardmen who had effortlessly held off the enemy came running back like a flock of frightened birds.</p><br/><p>Zaryusu calmly observed that sight. No, ever since that powerful foe appeared, he had been scrutinizing its every movement. His attention was focused on the undead being that could cast the killing fire.</p><br/><p>Its movements were completely different from the mindless foes from before. In all likelihood, that was the enemy commander.</p><br/><p>As the undead creature closed to within one hundred meters of the five Head Warriors, it began using \u300cFireball\u300d to execute area-of-effect attacks. This forced them to scatter, and it seemed intent on burning the Head Warriors to death during their run.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like it\u2019s time for us to take the field.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zaryusu nodded at Zenberu\u2019s words. Crusch signalled her agreement as well. She was aware that this might well be a battle where they might all meet a glorious end.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s time for us to go. Its power is shocking. Our foe might well be the personal subordinate of that Supreme One, or the commander of this army\u2026 Even if it\u2019s not, it must surely be a trump card of some sort.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed. Nobody can control multiple undead of such a level. But how shall we make our move? It seems a bit too far away for us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Crusch\u2019s question gave Zaryusu a headache.</p><br/><p>They were not fighting to die, so they had to plan around that.</p><br/><p>Zaryusu and Zenberu could not attack at range, so they had to close in for a melee. The problem now lay in the one hundred meters between them and the enemy.</p><br/><p>Zaryusu and the others could probably take one or two \u300cFireballs\u300d with ease, but they would probably take more than just one or two such hits before reaching their opponent, and the true struggle would begin once they got to it. It was not hard to see how the enemy would repulse them if they tried a frontal assault while taking fireball attacks.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat distance is pretty daunting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah\u2026 you got that right. To think a hundred meters could feel so far away\u2026:\u201d</p><br/><p>Zaryusu and friends wondered how they could reach the enemy with no or minimal damage.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about burrowing through the ground?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we used priestly powers\u2026 it\u2019d still be hard. If we could use \u300cInvisibility\u300d\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>They could probably close the gap instantly by going invisible and using the \u300cFly\u300d spell. However, druids could not cast such spells.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen how about making a shield and advancing with it held before us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaking a shield would take too long.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about tearing one of the houses down and using it as a shield?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zenberu smiled bitterly as he realised the futility of the words he had just spoken. The enemy attacked with explosive fireballs. Even if it was blocked, the searing temperatures would still scorch them from the side. There was no time now to make a full-body shield which could withstand high temperatures.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, yes\u2026 we can still do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it, Zaryusu?\u201d Crusch asked nervously, feeling a little afraid. <i>Is my face so scary</i>, Zaryusu wondered. Still, it could not be helped. After all, he was so stressed-out that he wanted to scream.</p><br/><p>\u201cA shield, you say\u2026 I think I just found one..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2666 \u2666 \u2666</p><br/><p>Igva nodded, pleased with himself and the present situation.</p><br/><p>Things were going very well. The Bloodmeat Hulks were still fighting, but he had successfully advanced to the village.</p><br/><p>Several stupid Lizardmen had tried to attack him, but after seeing the power of his \u300cFireballs\u300d, they realized that resistance was futile. The most successful attackers were the five who had split up to rush him, but even they had only managed to get within fifty meters of him.</p><br/><p>Igva walked on in silence, like he was strolling through an empty wasteland. While he pitied the weak Lizardmen \u2014\u200b albeit in a mocking fashion \u2014\u200b it would not do to be careless.</p><br/><p>He was close to the village, his objective. Once there, he intended to continuously launch \u300cFireballs\u300d to destroy the Lizardmen with their village.</p><br/><p>However, the Lizardmen would probably try to stop him from reaching his destination. That would mean it was about time for the next counterattack.</p><br/><p>Igva looked to the village, and his suspicions were vindicated.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Oh, I see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Igva saw a Hydra coming at him.</p><br/><p>If that was their ace in the hole, then the Lizardmen would lose the will to fight once he crushed it with overwhelming force. If that happened, he would be able to destroy the village more easily.</p><br/><p>For safety\u2019s sake, Igva looked around, then checked the sky, and halted only after verifying that there were no traces of the enemy. He leisurely waited for the Hydra to enter his attack range.</p><br/><p>As the Hydra reached the edge of said range, it began to sprint. As expected, it was heading straight for Igva.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow foolish. Did you think you could crawl all the way to me with that slothful speed of yours? Well, beasts will be beasts.\u201d</p><br/><p>With a mocking smile on his face, Igva conjured a \u300cFireball\u300d in his hand and launched it at the Hydra.</p><br/><p>It flew in a straight line and struck the Hydra dead center. The searing fires which emerged consumed the Hydra.</p><br/><p>However, the Hydra continued forward, albeit a little shaky on its feet. It continued running, though it was wreathed in flames\u2026 no, the flames had gone out in an instant, so Igva must have been seeing things. That said, the sight before him spoke of the Hydra\u2019s extraordinary willpower.</p><br/><p>Igva frowned in displeasure. The fact that it could withstand one of his magical attacks was a blow to his pride.</p><br/><p>While it was true that the Hydra seemed to have been enchanted with a defensive spell to reduce the damage it had taken, said defensive spell was not of a high tier and could not completely nullify his magic.</p><br/><p><i>\u2026If I recall correctly, Hydras have the ability of fast healing\u2026 but it shouldn\u2019t be able to withstand flame attacks. In any case, it\u2019s a beast, so it should be full of vitality. In that case, it makes sense that it could take a hit.</i></p><br/><p>That reasoning comforted Igva somewhat, but it could not douse the flames of rancor within his heart. Igva was a special monster who had been personally created by the Supreme Being Ainz Ooal Gown \u2014\u200b the fact that this creature had not died in one hit was an insult to his master.</p><br/><p>With cold eyes that were the polar opposite of the anger smoldering within him, Igva studied the oncoming Hydra.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026How displeasing. Die!\u201d</p><br/><p>He cast another fireball at the Hydra, and the roaring flames engulfed its body. For a moment he even thought he could smell its flesh charring from the distance. Even if his foe had not taken a fatal wound, surely it would hesitate over whether or not to continue forward.</p><br/><p>However\u2014\u200b</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014\u200bWhy is it not stopping? Why does it persist?\u201d</p><br/><p><b>Part 5</b></p><br/><p>Rororo continued its single-minded sprint forward. Its body was large, but it was running in the marsh, so its speed was about the same as that of a Lizardman. Water splashed in all directions and a liquid cacophony echoed all around it.</p><br/><p>Its amber eyes had turned cloudy from the great heat, and two of its four heads hung powerlessly.</p><br/><p>Even so, it continued sprinting forward.</p><br/><p>Another \u300cFireball\u300d came, striking Rororo\u2019s body. The thermal energy contained within the \u300cFireball\u300d exploded forth and washed all over it. The pain was like being beaten all over its body; its eyes felt drier than ever before, and the superheated air seared its lungs.</p><br/><p>Its entire body was burned, and the agony that had been wracking Rororo from just now told it that if it continued, its very life was forfeit.</p><br/><p>Even so \u2014\u200b it continued running.</p><br/><p>It ran.</p><br/><p>It ran on.</p><br/><p>It continued forward, never stopping. The high temperatures stripped the scales from its skin and causing blood-spurting blisters to blossom upon it, but even so it carried on, straight ahead.</p><br/><p>An unintelligent beast would naturally have turned and fled, but Rororo did not do so.</p><br/><p>Rororo was a magical beast called a Hydra.</p><br/><p>There were many kinds of magical beasts. Some possessed greater intelligence than a human being and some were little wiser than an average animal. Frankly speaking, Rororo belonged to the latter category.</p><br/><p>The fact that Rororo \u2014\u200b who possessed the wits of an average beast \u2014\u200b would continue forward, on the verge of death, towards Igva, the source of its pain was entirely unexpected, nearly impossible to understand.</p><br/><p>Indeed, even its opponent Igva found it difficult to understand. He wondered if Rororo was under the influence of some magical control.</p><br/><p>However, that was not the case.</p><br/><p>Indeed, that was not the answer.</p><br/><p>Igva would not be able to understand it.</p><br/><p>Rororo \u2014\u200b possessed of an animal\u2019s intelligence \u2014\u200b was running with all its might for its kin.</p><br/><p>Rororo had never seen its parents, yet Hydras were not the sort of creatures to abandon their offspring. Beasts of their kind would live with one of their parents until a certain age, learning how to survive in the wild. But then, why did this not apply to Rororo?</p><br/><p>That was because Rororo was a mutant. Normal Hydras had eight heads when born, and as they grew older, they sprouted more heads, to a maximum of twelve.</p><br/><p>However, Rororo only had four heads at birth, so its parents had abandoned it, taking its siblings with them.</p><br/><p>Without the protection of its parents, even a young Hydra \u2014\u200b who might someday grow into a powerful creature \u2014\u200b would surely perish in the harsh environs of nature.</p><br/><p>That is, if a certain Lizardman had not passed by and picked it up.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u200bAnd so, Rororo gained kin \u2014\u200b a father, a mother, and a close friend, all rolled into one.</p><br/><p>As Rororo\u2019s mind was about to break under the agony, it recalled a question it had always pondered in the past.</p><br/><p>Why was its body so big? Why did it have so many heads?</p><br/><p>It occasionally thought that as it looked at the dear parent who had raised it. As a result, Rororo had also thought of something else.</p><br/><p>Perhaps one day some of its heads might fall off, and its body might slowly sprout limbs like the way grass grew, and it would look like its parent.</p><br/><p>And if that really happened \u2014\u200b what would it ask for?</p><br/><p>Yes. They had not slept together in a long time, so perhaps it would ask to curl up and nap together. It had always felt lonely because it had become too big and they had to sleep apart.</p><br/><p>The flames felt like they were burning away Rororo\u2019s thoughts. They filled his vision and the agony shot through his body once more. It moaned in pain as the anguish washed over it. It felt a comforting warmth from behind, but it was nothing compared to the fire consuming Rororo.</p><br/><p>Rororo felt as though it were being smashed by countless iron hammers.</p><br/><p>It hurt so much that it could no longer think.</p><br/><p>Rororo\u2019s legs seized up, signalling to the rest of the creature that it should stop moving forward.</p><br/><p>However\u2014\u200b</p><br/><p>However \u2014\u200b was that really enough to make Rororo stop?</p><br/><p>\u2014\u200bNo. It did not stop.</p><br/><p>Rororo continued advancing. Its pace had slowed. Its muscles were burnt and stiff, and it could not continue running at its usual pace.</p><br/><p>It suffered with every step it took.</p><br/><p>It was difficult to breathe. Just drawing breath was hard. Perhaps its lungs had been seared.</p><br/><p>Even so, it did not stop.</p><br/><p>Now, only one of its heads could still move. The other motionless heads were little more than dead weight. The sight of the undead creature conjuring another fireball in its hand was a blurred scene in Rororo\u2019s cloudy vision.</p><br/><p>Its animal instincts allowed it to realize something.</p><br/><p>If it took another hit, it would die. However, Rororo was not afraid. Without stopping, without ceasing, it forged bravely ahead\u2014\u200b</p><br/><p>This was a request from its father, mother, and friend. Therefore it would never stop.</p><br/><p>Just as Rororo desperately \u2014\u200b and tiredly \u2014\u200b dragged itself forward, a crimson ball of fire flew forth once more from an undead hand. It soared through the air and headed straight for Rororo.</p><br/><p>There was no doubt that this last attack would consume Rororo in flames. It was an undeniable fact.</p><br/><p>It would die.</p><br/><p>It would be the end of everything.</p><br/><p>However\u2014\u200b</p><br/><p>Indeed \u2014\u200b that was only if the aforementioned Lizardman did not step in.</p><br/><p>How could he watch Rororo die before him?</p><br/><p>How could he permit such an injustice to take place?</p><br/><p>That was impossible\u2014\u200b</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014\u200b\u300cIcy Burst\u300d!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zaryusu shouted as he leapt from behind Rororo, swinging Frost Pain as he ran beside it.</p><br/><p>The air before the swing froze in an instant, forming a wall of white mist. This was a gout of supercooled air; the frozen wind of Frost Pain.</p><br/><p>That was one of Frost Pain\u2019s abilities.</p><br/><p>That was a special move which could only be used three times a day \u2014\u200b \u300cIcy Burst\u300d. It snap-froze everything in an area in front of it and caused massive damage.</p><br/><p>The wall of frozen fog was solid, and it blocked the oncoming \u300cFireball\u300d. The orb of ardent flame met the wall of chill mist \u2014\u200b by the laws of magic, allowing them to collide was the wisest choice.</p><br/><p>It hit\u2014\u200b</p><br/><p>The scorching flames burst forth, warring with the frozen mist of ivory.</p><br/><p>It seemed as though two serpents, one white and one red, were trying to consume each other. After a moment\u2019s resistance, both powers vanished.</p><br/><p>The undead creature was shocked, and its surprise showed on its face. That was a natural reaction to seeing the dissipation of the spell it had discharged.</p><br/><p>There was still some distance between both parties. However, they could already see each others\u2019 faces \u2014\u200b and movements. Rororo\u2019s effort and determination had crossed the seemingly untraversable distance between them and brought the three of them unharmed to this place.</p><br/><p>\u201cRororo\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zaryusu choked up. In the end, Zaryusu picked the most appropriate words he could think of from his vocabulary \u2014\u200b a simple, easily understood phrase.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d</p><br/><p>As he left those shouted thanks with Rororo, Zaryusu charged forward without looking back, trailed by Zenberu and Crusch.</p><br/><p>An almost inaudible croak answered him. It was the sound of encouragement for its kin.</p><br/><p>\u2666 \u2666 \u2666</p><br/><p>Igva stared in silence. His \u300cFireball\u300d had been countered, and he could not stop himself from expressing his disbelief in words.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis cannot be!\u201d</p><br/><p>Igva prepared to cast another spell. Naturally, it was still a \u300cFireball\u300d. He was not prepared to acknowledge that the Lizardmen charging at him had actually neutralized his magic.</p><br/><p>The launched \u300cFireball\u300d streaked at the three Lizardmen.</p><br/><p>The leading Lizardman swung its sword and blocked the \u300cFireball\u300d with a wall of freezing mist, and both vanished together. Yes, the same thing as just now had happened\u2014\u200b</p><br/><p>\u201cBring it on! I\u2019ll cancel out everything you throw at me!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Lizardman\u2019s furious cry entered his ears.</p><br/><p>Igva went \u201ccheh\u201d in displeasure.</p><br/><p><i>To think a mere Lizardman could deflect a spell from me, a creation of the Supreme Being Ainz-sama!</i></p><br/><p>Igva worked to suppress his boiling anger.</p><br/><p>It was quite likely that he could not use \u300cFireball\u300d any more. However, the fact that his opposition had taken shelter behind the Hydra and approached meant that there was a probably a limit to the number of times that ability could be used. Still, he did not know if it could be used ten times, or if every use would only deplete stamina \u2014\u200b meaning that with the appropriate recovery, it could be used without limit.</p><br/><p><i>How should I deal with this? I\u2019d like to verify his words, if possible\u2026</i></p><br/><p>Igva could still discharge \u300cFireballs\u300d, but he could not tell how much of the Lizardman\u2019s words were truth or bravado.</p><br/><p>Less than forty meters separated Igva from the Lizardmen.</p><br/><p>In addition, the Lizardman charging him looked like a warrior. As an undead magic caster, Igva did not wish to be drawn into a melee.</p><br/><p>Therefore, his \u300cFireballs\u300d could no longer be used. He was not stupid enough to actually test how many more times his opponent could block his techniques under the circumstances. If only they had not hid behind that Hydra \u2014\u200b that is to say, if they had not yet closed the gap \u2014\u200b he might have attempted to verify their claims. However, that damnable Hydra had ruined that chance.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn\u2026 a mere Hydra.\u201d</p><br/><p>Igva cursed, and decided on his next move.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014\u200bThen, how about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>By coincidence, his foes had strung themselves out into a straight line. Igva extended a ginger and pointed at the three Lizardmen who were pressing in. Electricity crackled around that digit.</p><br/><p>\u201cTaste my \u300cLightning\u300d!\u201d</p><br/><p>A stream of white electricity flashed forward, and then\u2014\u200b</p><br/><p>\u2666 \u2666 \u2666</p><br/><p>Zaryusu was still some distance away, but he could see the white light coruscating around Igva\u2019s finger \u2014\u200b \u300cLightning\u300d.</p><br/><p>Frost Pain\u2019s \u300cIcy Burst\u300d could defend against cold- and fire-elemental attacks, but Zaryusu had never used it against lightning strikes, and he did not know if it would work.</p><br/><p>Then, would it be wiser to take a risk, or fan out to disperse the enemy\u2019s targets and minimize the damage taken?</p><br/><p>Zaryusu gripped Frost Pain tightly.</p><br/><p>He could feel the electrical surge in the air, the proof that the lightning strike was aimed at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave it to me\u2014\u200b!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zenberu acted faster than Zaryusu could, and leapt forward with a great cry. The spell discharged at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014\u200b\u300cLightning\u300d!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUooooh \u2014\u200b \u300cResistance Massive\u300d!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just when it seemed that the lightning bolt was about to pierce Zenberu, his body instantly pumped up. In the end, the electrical discharge which should have pierced him and the two people behind him was scattered and deflected.</p><br/><p>\u300cResistance Massive\u300d.</p><br/><p>This was a monk ability, which discharged ki from the entire body to reduce magical damage.</p><br/><p>It was a technique Zenberu had learned during his travels, after losing to Frost Pain\u2019s \u300cIcy Burst\u300d in the past. The technique could be used to defend against any spell which did damage, even if it did so in an area..</p><br/><p>Both sides gasped in surprise, but Zaryusu and Crusch \u2014\u200b who believed in their comrade \u2014\u200b were not overly shocked by this. Thus, while the undead magic caster reeled in surprise, the Lizardmen drew ever closer.</p><br/><p>As he dashed forth, Zaryusu suddenly realised something.</p><br/><p>If he had used \u300cIcy Burst\u300d during his duel with Zenberu, that move would have been countered by this technique, and Zenberu would have used the opening to defeat him. Perhaps that was why he had been trying to get Zaryusu to use that move on him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha! Like falling off a log!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zaryusu smiled at Zenberu\u2019s confident voice, but his face tightened up almost immediately afterwards. That was because Zaryusu could hear an undercurrent of pain in his voice.</p><br/><p>If even a Lizardman like Zenberu could not hold back his pain, that implied his wounds were not light. In addition, if that technique had no weaknesses, he would not have agreed to the plan of hiding behind Rororo.</p><br/><p>Zaryusu looked ahead. Less than twenty meters separated them from their enemy. The great distance between them had shrunk that far.</p><br/><p>\u2666 \u2666 \u2666</p><br/><p>As they drew closer, Igva realised that the people before him were powerful opponents, not to be taken lightly. The fact that they could counter his spells was worthy of praise. Of course, he had other ways to attack, but now he had to give some consideration to defense.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are excellent sacrifices; perfectly qualified for me to demonstrate my power.\u201d</p><br/><p>Igva smiled coldly as he cast his spell.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u300cSummon Undead 4th\u300d.\u201d</p><br/><p>Amidst a spray of bubbles, four skeletons emerged from the marsh to defend Igva, each holding round shields and curved swords. These undead were called Skeleton Warriors, and they were in a completely different league from regular Skeletons.</p><br/><p>While he could have summoned other undead, he had chosen the Skeleton Warriors in order to resist cold attacks. Igva and other skeletal creatures like him were immune to cold damage.</p><br/><p>Protected by his bodyguard squad, Igva looked down upon the approaching enemy. It was the attitude of a reigning champion awaiting a challenger.</p><br/><p>The two of them finally drew near each other.</p><br/><p>Only ten meters separated them now.</p><br/><p>They were only that far apart now. Yes, that was all the distance separating them. After making sure that the undead would not immediately launch an attack, he glanced behind himself.</p><br/><p>He looked at the distance they had travelled. It was very close if all they had to do was run it, but that one hundred meters was a killing field without any cover. Without Rororo, Frost Pain, Zenberu, or Crusch, he would never have been able to come this far. One could say it was as difficult as trying to ascend into the heavens. However, he had crossed that distance, and he was within reach of his foe.</p><br/><p>They had overcome that distance together.</p><br/><p>As Zaryusu saw the Lizardmen take Rororo back to the village, he breathed a momentary sigh of relief. Then he chastised himself for his moment of laxity, and looked back at the undead before him.</p><br/><p>Zaryusu could frankly admit that they were fearsome foes.</p><br/><p>If he had encountered them under different circumstances, he would have immediately elected to flee upon sighting them from far away. Just by standing before them, his instincts were screaming at him to flee, and even his tail was standing on end. From the corner of his eye, Zaryusu noted that Zenberu and Crusch\u2019s tails were exhibiting similar reactions to his left and right.</p><br/><p>The two of them must be thinking the same thing as Zaryusu. Indeed \u2014\u200b they were fighting the urge to flee as they faced the undead before them.</p><br/><p>Zaryusu swished his tail, swatting them across the back.</p><br/><p>The two of them looked at Zaryusu with looks of surprise on their faces.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can beat them if the three of us work together,\u201d Zaryusu said simply.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell said, Zaryusu. We can win.\u201d</p><br/><p>Crusch used her tail to caress the spot on her back where Zaryusu had swatted her.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa, now that would be something, wouldn\u2019t it!?\u201d Zenberu laughed, a look of pride on his face.</p><br/><p>And so, the three of them travelled the final stretch to their enemy.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u200bThe distance between both sides was eight meters.</p><br/><p>On one hand were Zaryusu and gang, who had run all the way here and were panting. Facing them were the undead, who did not breathe. Their eyes met, and the enemy spoke first.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am Igva, an Elder Lich under the banner of the Supreme One. Bow before me and I will grant you a quick and painless death.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zaryusu could not help but smile, because this undead being called Igva knew nothing.</p><br/><p>No matter how hard he thought, there was only one answer.</p><br/><p>Zaryusu was smiling, but Igva was not displeased. Instead, he quietly awaited their answer. Igva was knew his strength, and he was confident that he could eliminate Zaryusu and his companions. That was why his attitude was one of superiority and even a bit of gratitude \u2014\u200b after all, they had come all this way to deliver themselves to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me your answer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuku, well, if you really want to know\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zaryusu raised Frost Pain and gripped it tightly. Zenberu raised his fists, taking a special fighting stance. Crusch made no special movements, but she touched the wellspring of mana within her, prepared to cast a spell at any moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, here\u2019s my answer \u2014\u200b dream on!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Skeleton Warriors considered that response to be hostility, and they raised their swords while covering themselves with their shields.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen prepare to die in incomparable agony, knowing that you have rejected my final mercy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was about to say, the dead ought to get their asses back to the underworld, Igva!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, the curtain rose on the climax of the battle which would determine the outcome of this conflict.</p><br/><p>\u2666 \u2666 \u2666</p><br/><p>\u201cGet him, Zaryusu!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zenberu charged before anyone else, striking at a Skeleton Warrior.</p><br/><p>He did not care that the Skeleton Warrior blocked his blow with its shield; he simply shoved it back with sheer brute force. The shield buckled inwards, and the backpedalling Skeleton Warrior collided into the other Skeleton Warriors and they lost their balance. He also attempted to swat at another Skeleton Warrior with his tail, but it failed to connect.</p><br/><p>The formation of Skeleton Warriors buckled under Zenberu\u2019s onslaught, and Zaryusu immediately filled the gap they had vacated.</p><br/><p>\u201cBlock him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Two Skeleton Warriors swung at Zaryusu with their curved blades as they heard Igva\u2019s command.</p><br/><p>He could have avoided them if he wanted to. If he wanted to take the blows head on, he could have blocked them with Frost Pain. However, Zaryusu did neither. Evasion meant that he would slow down, and he did not want to make such a pointless move in front of Igva.</p><br/><p>Besides, somebody else had already made a move\u2014\u200b</p><br/><p>\u201c\u300cEarth Bind\u300d!\u201d</p><br/><p>The mud lashed out like whips, entangling the two Skeleton Warriors. Said whips of mud seemed like iron chains; they immobilized the Skeleton Warriors as Zaryusu took advantage of the opening.</p><br/><p>Yes \u2014\u200b Crusch was there too.</p><br/><p>Zaryusu was not fighting alone. He could entrust himself to his comrades.</p><br/><p>Even Crusch\u2019s magic could not completely seal off her enemies\u2019 movements. The Skeleton Warriors\u2019 blades grazed Zaryusu. However, those injuries meant nothing to him; the boiling hot blood within his soul disregarded the concept of pain.</p><br/><p>Zaryusu opened up his steps with flying strides.</p><br/><p>He rushed at Igva, who was pointing at him. Even if he was hit by an attack spell, he was determined to eat the hit and keep running.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou fool! Know fear! \u300cScare\u300d!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zaryusu\u2019s vision shuddered. He began to wonder where he was as a nameless terror bloomed within him, and he felt as though something was going to lunge at him from the side.</p><br/><p>He stopped in his tracks. The \u300cScare\u300d spell had shaken his heart and kept his legs from obeying him. His mind told his legs to move, but his heart would not allow his body to take a step.</p><br/><p>\u201cZaryusu! \u300cLion\u2019s Heart\u300d!\u201d</p><br/><p>As Crusch shouted those words, the terror melted away in an instant, and in its place was a rekindled fighting spirit. The spell that bestowed courage had exorcised the fear from his heart.</p><br/><p>Igva glared unhappily at Crusch and pointed a finger at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cInterfering busybody! \u300cLightning\u300d!\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a flash of white\u2014\u200b</p><br/><p>\u201cGyaaah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u200bAnd Crusch wailed.</p><br/><p>Zaryusu\u2019s heart wavered; it was nearly consumed by an intense hatred, but he managed to control himself in the end. Hate was a useful weapon at times, but against a powerful enemy, it might end up working against him. When faced with a mighty foe, one needed fiery passion and ice-cold logic.</p><br/><p>Zaryusu did not look back.</p><br/><p>After Igva attacked Crusch, it meant that Zaryusu had an opening with which to draw closer. A look of dismay came over Igva\u2019s face, and he knew that he had made a mistake. That, in turn, brought a mocking smile to Zaryusu, whose beloved had been hurt.</p><br/><p>\u201cCheh! \u300cLight-\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cToo slow!\u201d</p><br/><p>Frost Pain slashed in from the side, knocking away the finger Igva was planning to extend.</p><br/><p>\u201cGah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou let a warrior near you, magic caster! Don\u2019t even think of casting spells any more!\u201d</p><br/><p>Legendary spellcasters aside, most magic casters who allowed an enemy to get close might find their spells disrupted during the casting.</p><br/><p>Even a powerful monster like Igva was no exception.</p><br/><p>Zaryusu narrowed his eyes, confused by the sensation running up his arm. Slashing him felt weird; Igva must have had some kind of resistance to his weapon.</p><br/><p>Still, he was not unhurt. Yes, if he could resist damage, then all he had to do was inflict more damage.</p><br/><p>That being the case, all he had to do was keep hacking away at him.</p><br/><p>Of course, it was easier said than done, and Zaryusu knew that as well. However, that was all a warrior like Zaryusu could do.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look down on me, Lizardman!\u201d</p><br/><p>Three arrows of light appeared before Igva and shot at Zaryusu. He reflexively parried the unannounced bolts with his sword, but the magic arrows went straight through his weapon and pierced his body, sending a surge of throbbing pain through him.</p><br/><p>This was a \u300cSilent Magic \u2013 Magic Arrow\u300d. There was no preparation needed for silenced spells, so they could not be interrupted. In addition, Magic Arrows were unavoidable spells; not even by someone like Zaryusu.</p><br/><p>Zaryusu grit his teeth and swung Frost Pain at Igva.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuh! Son of a bitch! You\u2019re just a mere Lizardman!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300cMagic Arrows\u300d were an unavoidable spell, but conversely, they did poor damage. Someone like Zaryusu, with a body honed through hundreds, if not thousands of battles, was not weak enough to be rendered incapable of fighting by such a spell.</p><br/><p>The magic missiles struck Zaryusu again, evincing bolts of bone-jarring pain from him. Zaryusu took the pain and countered with a sword swing.</p><br/><p>After several rounds of this back and forth, Zaryusu\u2019s movements began slowing down. The severe throbbing hampered his otherwise nimble movements, clearly illustrating the difference between himself and the undead, who knew no pain.</p><br/><p>Igva and Zaryusu both realised this, and their expressions were dramatically different as a result.</p><br/><p>The strong would live, and the weak would die. That was an unalterable truth. It had been clearly illustrated in Zaryusu and Igva\u2019s one-on-one fight. However, it was also true that the weak could contend with the strong if they banded together.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u300cMiddle Cure Wounds\u300d!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zaryusu\u2019s pain vanished with those words, and his vitality returned to him.</p><br/><p>That magical healing from the rear aggravated the hitherto aloof Igva, and he cursed loudly:</p><br/><p>\u201cDamned Lizardmen!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zaryusu was fighting with his trusted companions; Crusch, Zenberu, and\u2014\u200b</p><br/><p>\u201cRororo\u2026 I won\u2019t lose!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch foolish delusions\u2026 as if I, a creation of the Supreme One, would be defeated by the likes of you! How stupid you are!\u201d</p><br/><p>Igva glared malevolently at the three Lizardmen. He had not used summon magic because the undead he had called up were still around. He could not summon new undead as long as the old ones were still around. Therefore, their battle was a monotonous back-and-forth of Igva casting silenced \u300cMagic Arrows\u300d while Zaryusu hacked at Igva.</p><br/><p>It felt like it would never end.</p><br/><p>That being the case, the deadlock would have to be broken by the backliners. If reinforcements turned up for either side, the battle would soon be decided in their favor.</p><br/><p>Zaryusu and Igva both knew this.</p><br/><p>\u2666 \u2666 \u2666</p><br/><p>The stroke of lightning made Crusch hurt all over, but she bit her pain back and cast \u300cSummon Beast 3rd\u300d.</p><br/><p>A huge \u2014\u200b roughly one hundred fifty centimeters \u2014\u200b crab with an enormous right pincer appeared from the surface of the water, as though it had always been sleeping there and just woken up. Needless to say, it had been conjured by the \u300cSummon Beast 3rd\u300d spell.</p><br/><p>The giant crab waddled up beside Zenberu and pinched at the Skeleton Warriors with its massive claw.</p><br/><p>Zenberu smiled at this unexpected ally. Considering that he had to defend Crusch and ward off attacks from all directions, the help had arrived just in time, and it was a great reassurance for him.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll right, strange and giant crab! I\u2019ll leave those two to you!\u201d</p><br/><p>The giant crab \u2014 a Snap Grasp \u2014 wiggled its smaller pincer\u200b as though in acknowledgement and turned to the Skeleton Warriors.</p><br/><p><i>The situation is dire now\u2026 but I can\u2019t help thinking that they look very similar.</i></p><br/><p>Crusch smiled, despite the circumstances. However, she immediately wiped it off her face and focused on the battle. At the same time, she breathed hard, to get her panting under control.</p><br/><p>She had cast warding spells on Rororo and healed him before coming here, and she had also been casting support spells on Zenberu. She had been overexerting herself.</p><br/><p>In addition, she had cast a summon spell on top of that. Her body was in an exhausted state and she was having trouble standing.</p><br/><p>She even lacked the strength to heal herself. In addition, Crusch had also calmly decided that the mana would have been wasted on doing so, given that she was slowly losing the ability to fight.</p><br/><p>However, if she felt here, it would demoralize Zenberu and Zaryusu, who were fighting on the frontlines. Blood flowed from the corner of Crusch\u2019s mouth as she bit at the inside of her cheek to keep herself conscious.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u300cMiddle Cure Wounds\u300d!\u201d</p><br/><p>She cast healing magic on Zaryusu, who was engaged in a melee with Igva.</p><br/><p>Her legs felt powerless and her vision was shaky. She felt a liquid sensation all over her body..</p><br/><p>For a moment, Crusch had no idea why she had ended up like that. When had she fallen into the mud?</p><br/><p>However, she immediately realised the reason why. She had not taken additional wounds, so she must have passed out for a moment and collapsed.</p><br/><p>Crusch breathed a sigh of relief, not because she was still alive, but because she could still fight.</p><br/><p>She did not plan to force herself to stand. Rather, she had no strength left to stand, and she felt it would be a waste of energy to do so.</p><br/><p>She saw the forms of Zaryusu and Zenberu fighting hard in her blurred vision; the forms of the companions she had travelled with for a brief period. Zenberu had taken on four Skeleton Warriors at once, and Zaryusu had endured Igva\u2019s onslaught of magical attacks. Both of them were covered in wounds.</p><br/><p>Crusch got her breathing under control, and cast a spell.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u300cMiddle Cure Wounds\u300d!\u201d</p><br/><p>And in addition to healing Zenberu\u2019s wounds\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u300cMiddle Cure Wounds\u300d!\u201d</p><br/><p>She healed Zaryusu\u2019s injuries.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Crusch was panting.</p><br/><p>Her breathing felt strange. She was breathless, no matter how hard she tried to take in air.</p><br/><p>This must be a symptom of magic overuse. Her head ached like she had been clubbed. Even so, Crusch tried her hardest to force her eyes open.</p><br/><p>So many people had died so far \u2014\u200b how could she be the first to leave the battlefield?</p><br/><p>As she forcefully opened her heavy-lidded eyes, she continued casting:</p><br/><p>\u201c\u300cMiddle Cure Wounds\u300d!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2666 \u2666 \u2666</p><br/><p>Zenberu\u2019s clenched fist struck home on the Skeleton Warrior\u2019s skull. He felt the bone crumple, then shatter under his fist, and so another Skeleton Warrior bit the dust.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s two \u2014 \u200bgahahahahh \u2014\u200b\u201d</p><br/><p>He exhaled like he was breathing out all his fatigue and then eyed the remaining Skeleton Warriors. The giant crab Crusch had summoned was nowhere to be seen, but thanks to its help in dealing with two of the Skeleton Warriors, Zenberu could wipe out the other two.</p><br/><p>The situation had developed in this way thanks to Crusch\u2019s support.</p><br/><p>Two more. After those were deal with, Igva would be next.</p><br/><p>He flexed his thick and powerful right arm \u2014\u200b it was still working.</p><br/><p>His left arm was covered in wounds and almost useless. Zenberu had gone a bit overboard in using it as a shield. He glanced briefly to the limp, sagging limb.</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it, it was a worthy sacrifice.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zenberu eyed the annoying thing and tried to move it. An intense pain filled his body \u2014\u200b it hardly seemed as though it could come from moving his fingers.</p><br/><p><i>Still, is this a big deal? Just now, one of my friends refused to stop moving even after his heads became useless. How could I, Zenberu, do any less?</i></p><br/><p>Zenberu could appreciate how strong the Skeleton Warriors were after fighting them for this long. They were strong enough that two of them were enough to match him.</p><br/><p>Therefore, dealing with four at once meant that his chances of victory were very slim.</p><br/><p><i>After this, I\u2019ll stop eating mud crabs for a while to show my thanks.</i></p><br/><p>With that silent gesture of appreciation towards his favorite food, he glared murderously at the two Skeleton Warriors who were pressing in.</p><br/><p>He clenched his fist.</p><br/><p>He could still move. He could still fight.</p><br/><p>Frankly speaking, he was quite surprised by the fact that he could continue fighting.</p><br/><p>\u201cHah! There\u2019s no point thinking about such stupid things!\u201d</p><br/><p>There was only one reason for that, right?</p><br/><p>Zenberu laughed at himself.</p><br/><p>He observed Zaryusu\u2019s form behind the Skeleton Warriors, how he stood tall against that foe whose power overmatched his by far.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks pretty heroic, doesn\u2019t he\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Indeed\u2014\u200b</p><br/><p>He could keep fighting because he had been struggling together with Zaryusu, Crusch and Rororo.</p><br/><p>\u201cOi oi oi, Zaryusu, you\u2019re pretty damn beat up, aren\u2019t you? Worse than how you were in that fight with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>With a ferocious backhand, he smashed away one of the incoming Skeleton Warriors. However, he could not block the curved blade of the other one with his left arm, and he earned another gash on his side, near the wound Crusch had just closed with magic.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Crusch is having a hard time herself, but she\u2019s still helping us. Good on her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Crusch\u2019s magic healed Zenberu\u2019s wounds once more. He could not turn back to verify, but it would seem her voice was coming from somewhere very close to the surface of the water. He could imagine the posture in which she was casting her spells \u2014\u200b but even so, she was still casting them.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What a remarkable female.\u201d</p><br/><p>If he had to take a wife, he would pick someone like her.</p><br/><p>Zenberu was slightly envious of Zaryusu now.</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t show you the disgraceful sight of me going down first!\u201d</p><br/><p>He feinted with his massive arm, and then swiped with his tail. Then he laughed coldly, commenting that he was older than either of them.</p><br/><p>The two Skeleton Warriors slowly drew closer, their shields raised. The way they blocked his view of Zaryusu angered Zenberu.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet lost, I can\u2019t see his manly back!\u201d</p><br/><p>With a roar, Zenberu strode forth\u2014\u200b</p><br/><p>\u2666 \u2666 \u2666</p><br/><p>Igva and Zaryusu\u2019s evenly-balanced back and forth continued. Zaryusu\u2019s eyes were focused on the battle, and he noticed Igva glancing elsewhere. The Elder Lich\u2019s undead face contorted in a savage grin, and Zaryusu\u2019s heart seemed to freeze as he heard what came next.</p><br/><p>He heard the sound of splashing as someone collapsed into the water.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook! Your friend has fallen!\u201d</p><br/><p>He could not look back. Perhaps one of his comrades had collapsed, or perhaps not. Zaryusu\u2019s heart ached like he was having his scales flayed off him, but he was facing an overwhelmingly powerful opponent, and he did not have the luxury of looking away. His defeat would be sealed in the moment he turned to look. Zaryusu had not come here to lose in such a foolish way.</p><br/><p>He had come here to win.</p><br/><p>However, if Igva spoke the truth, then it might be possible that enemy reinforcements might have come from behind them. He had to think of a way to deal with them, or things might get ugly.</p><br/><p>Just as Zaryusu was steeling himself to endure an attack spell, he heard the sound of someone splashing as they stood up, as well as the sound of several bones cracking.</p><br/><p>\u201cZaryusu! We\u2019re done here! The rest is up to you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u300cMiddle Cure Wounds\u300d.\u201d</p><br/><p>A great splash followed Zenberu\u2019s pained cry.</p><br/><p>Crusch\u2019s incantation sounded more like a groan, but Zaryusu\u2019s wounds slowly mended themselves.</p><br/><p>\u201cMuuu\u2014\u200b~\u201d</p><br/><p>Igva was clearly unhappy at this. Even without looking, he could tell that the other two had done their part. That would mean that after this\u2014\u200b</p><br/><p>\u201cMy turn!\u201d</p><br/><p>Igva blocked the slash from Frost Pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cKukuku\u2026 I, Igva, am an Elder Lich, but don\u2019t look down on me because I\u2019m not a melee fighter!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2666 \u2666 \u2666</p><br/><p>Despite his tough talk, Igva had already surmised that his chances of victory were slim.</p><br/><p>Given the difference in their strength, he might be able to win in a one-on-one battle. However, the white Lizardman had been healing his wounds all this time, so now Zaryusu had the advantage in vitality.</p><br/><p>In addition, he could only block one out of every three strikes made at him. That meant the other two would hit him. While Igva was resistant to slashing weapons like Skeletons, and he was not worried about the additional cold damage Frost Pain inflicted, his situation was still quite dire.</p><br/><p>He panicked.</p><br/><p>He was a creation of the Supreme Being Ainz Ooal Gown and the commander of this army. He could not afford to lose here.</p><br/><p>Igva wanted to summon a few more undead soldiers, but he needed time to cast the summoning spell. Therefore, it was difficult to get the spell off while his enemy was right in front of him.</p><br/><p>If this kept up, victory would go to his enemy.</p><br/><p>With that in mind, Igva fell back to his last resort. It was not an ideal method \u2014\u200b it might even be the worst course of action if things went poorly \u2014\u200b but it was the only card he had left to play.</p><br/><p>Zaryusu was confused by Igva turning to run, but he pursued regardless. Igva took a full-power hit from Zaryusu square in the back and wavered, but did not fall. Zaryusu clicked his tongue at Igva\u2019s seemingly inexhaustible vitality and immediately gave chase after the fleeing Igva.</p><br/><p>Igva turned, his face distorted with an anger that seemed unbecoming on an undead being, but his expression was tinted with shades of delight.</p><br/><p>Sizzling in his hand was a crimson light \u2014\u200b a \u300cFireball\u300d.</p><br/><p>Confusion filled Zaryusu\u2019s mind as he drew close.</p><br/><p><i>Does he plan to use an area-effect spell at such close range? Is he prepared to sacrifice himself \u2014\u200b no!</i></p><br/><p>A thrill of fear ran through Zaryusu\u2019s heart as he realised Igva was not looking at him. Igva\u2019s eyes were directed behind Zaryusu \u2014\u200b at the fallen Crusch and Zenberu.</p><br/><p><i>\u2014\u200bWhat should I do!?</i></p><br/><p>Zaryusu racked his brains.</p><br/><p>Igva was leaving himself wide open. If he ignored the two of them, he could finish off Igva. But if he wanted to save them, it was hard to predict how the battle would turn out. Both of them were badly hurt, and a single misstep might prove fatal.</p><br/><p>Had they not come so far for this objective \u2014\u200b to beat Igva? Many people had died for this cause as well.</p><br/><p>In that case, he ought to abandon them. They would probably smile and forgive him. Zaryusu would probably do the same in their position.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u200bHowever.</p><br/><p>Zaryusu would not choose to leave comrades he had fought and bled with to die.</p><br/><p>In that case \u2014\u200b he would help them, and then destroy Igva.</p><br/><p>After making up his mind, things became very simple.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u300cIcy Burst\u300d!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zaryusu erected a wall of freezing fog which billowed up from his feet.</p><br/><p>\u201cGwaaaargh\u2014\u200b!\u201d</p><br/><p>The frozen vortex froze Zaryusu solid for a moment; the pain filling his entire body was beyond words.</p><br/><p>Zaryusu fixed his eyes intently on Igva to prevent himself from losing consciousness, struggling against the pain.</p><br/><p>As he grit his teeth and wailed in pain, the icy mist enshrouded them and drifted in all directions.</p><br/><p>As Igva saw the spreading white mist he grinned, his expression seemingly saying, \u201cJust as planned.\u201d His foe could have won if he had abandoned his friends, but yet he had done this.</p><br/><p>Igva was immune to cold and electrical damage, which was why he could stand tall amidst the current of freezing air. He crushed the \u300cFireball\u300d in his hand back into mana, because allowing it to touch the wall of white which now surrounded him was a self-destructive gesture.</p><br/><p>Once this white mist cleared, he could finish off the other two Lizardmen. First, he had to eliminate the one that was still standing. Igva looked around, and snarled. That was because he had missed something.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026All right, where\u2019s he gone to now?\u201d</p><br/><p>His vision was blocked by walls of white mist.</p><br/><p>Igva possessed darkvision, but he could not see through environmental conditions which impeded visibility. Therefore, he had lost track of his enemy\u2019s location.</p><br/><p>Still, there was no need to worry too much. Judging by that pain-filled cry, his opponent ought to have been badly hurt. Come to think of it, given that the cold was powerful enough to repel a \u300cFireball\u300d he had projected, he ought to have taken cold damage comparable to being hit by a \u300cFireball\u300d himself.</p><br/><p>Taking a hit like that while being so badly wounded might be fatal. That being the case, he could take his time and torment him slowly afterwards.</p><br/><p>His goal now was to get out of this bank of fog.</p><br/><p>As the idea came up, Igva immediately discarded it.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u200bRight now, moving would expose his position.</p><br/><p>Rather than retreat, he ought to summon more undead. As long as he had meat shields in place, victory was his, even if the Lizardman was not dead yet.</p><br/><p>Just as Igva was about to cast his spell, he heard a sudden splashing.</p><br/><p>\u2666 \u2666 \u2666</p><br/><p>Frost Pain.</p><br/><p>It was one of the Four Treasures of the Lizardmen, passed down through the generations.</p><br/><p>According to legend, Frost Pain was made from the ice when the lake had frozen over for the only time in its history, and it possessed three magical powers.</p><br/><p>The first was the cold aura wreathing the blade, which inflicted additional cold damage on every successful blow.</p><br/><p>The second was its trump card, \u300cIcy Burst\u300d, usable only three times a day.</p><br/><p>And the third was\u2014\u200b</p><br/><p>\u2666 \u2666 \u2666</p><br/><p>The sound of something cutting through the air reached his ears</p><br/><p>Before he realized what was going on, he saw the point of a blade before his eyes.</p><br/><p>A great impact rocked Igva\u2019s cranium.</p><br/><p>The blade that had pierced his left eye rattled his head. Igva howled in surprise as he finally realised what was going on.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuwaaargh\u2014\u200b! Why aren\u2019t you dead\u2014\u200b!?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Frost Pain sank deeper into his left eyesocket, he felt his vitality draining away in torrents\u2014\u200b</p><br/><p>The fog steadily dispersed, revealing Zaryusu, whose body was dusted with a light coating of frost. He stood before Igva, who was unsteady on his feet given that he had a sword sticking out of his head.</p><br/><p>Igva could not understand how Zaryusu was still standing after such a powerful cold-based attack.</p><br/><p>\u2666 \u2666 \u2666</p><br/><p>That was due to the third power hidden within Frost Pain.</p><br/><p>It was a defensive ability which imparted resistance to cold attacks.</p><br/><p>\u2666 \u2666 \u2666</p><br/><p>Of course, even Frost Pain could not completely cancel out the power of \u300cIcy Burst\u300d. It was hard enough for Zaryusu to stay on his feet after taking that cold damage. His breathing was ragged, his movements were sluggish, and his tail was sprawled limply on the ground. He was barely capable of fighting on. In fact, that last blow of his had not been aimed at all. He had simply acted on instinct, fuelling that blow with the last dregs of his strength.</p><br/><p>One could say that it was a lucky shot.</p><br/><p>Zaryusu struggled to keep his almost-closed eyes open.</p><br/><p>The strike he had launched with the remains of his strength felt like it had been enough to finish off Igva.</p><br/><p>No longer able to fight, Zaryusu looked at Igva, an expectant look on his face.</p><br/><p>Igva shook and struggled.</p><br/><p>Perhaps Igva could no longer sustain his bodily integrity, but the skin of his face tore and his bones fragmented, while his clothes fell into tatters. It was only a matter of time before he was destroyed. Just as Zaryusu thought he had won a miraculous victory \u2014\u200b</p><br/><p>\u2014\u200bA bony hand seized him by the throat.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 I am a vassal created by the Supreme Being\u2026 how can I die\u2026 like this!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Igva\u2019s stranglehold was not strong, and he could have shrugged it off. However\u2014\u200b</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014\u200bGuwaargh\u2014\u200b!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u200bAgony surged through Zaryusu\u2019s body, and he cried out in pain.</p><br/><p>That was because he was being infused with negative energy, which ate away at his life force. Zaryusu was trained to withstand pain, but he could not bear the terrible anguish that turned his veins to ice.</p><br/><p>\u201cDie, you damned Lizardman!\u201d</p><br/><p>Igva\u2019s face began to crumble, and the fragments disintegrated in mid-air.</p><br/><p>Igva\u2019s life was fading away, but his loyalty to his master kept him clinging to this side of the line between life and death.</p><br/><p>Zaryusu tried to resist it, but fear filled him as he realised his body no longer responded to commands.</p><br/><p>He too was on the verge of death. Igva\u2019s negative energy infusion was snuffing out the last of his lifeforce.</p><br/><p>Zaryusu\u2019s vision wavered and turned cloudy.</p><br/><p>It seemed as though the world was slowly filling up with white mist.</p><br/><p>Igva was also trying desperately to stay conscious, but he smiled in victory as he saw Zaryusu\u2019s resistance flagging.</p><br/><p>He had to kill this Lizardman and the two other Lizardmen who had joined the attack. They ought to be the strongest among their race.</p><br/><p>That being the case, killing them would be an offering to his great master \u2014\u200b the best possible present he could give to his creator.</p><br/><p>Igva\u2019s expression spoke more than his words could, but that look in his eyes made Zaryusu realize that he felt the same way as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo to hell!\u201d</p><br/><p>His body no longer responded to him, and he could feel his body heat dropping slowly, like a slow poison spreading through him. Even breathing was difficult. Only his mind remained sharp under these circumstances.</p><br/><p>He could not die yet.</p><br/><p>Rororo, who ran with all his strength.</p><br/><p>Zenberu, who had made himself his shield.</p><br/><p>Crusch, who had depleted her mana.</p><br/><p>And then, there were all the Lizardmen who had died fighting this war.</p><br/><p>As Zaryusu thought about how to fight on, he heard something.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u200bCrusch\u2019s gentle tones.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u200bZenberu\u2019s cheerful voice.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u200bRororo\u2019s playful cries.</p><br/><p>He could not have heard them.</p><br/><p>Crusch was unconscious. Zenberu was comatose. Rororo was far away as well.</p><br/><p>Had his mind imagined those voices because his mind was clouded? Had it made up the voices of friends he had not even known for a full week? The cries of his kin?</p><br/><p>No.</p><br/><p>Indeed, that was not correct.</p><br/><p>That was because everyone was here\u2014\u200b</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014\u200bOh\u2026oh\u2014\u200b!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014\u200b!? You still have this much strength left!?\u201d</p><br/><p>The semi-conscious Zaryusu howled, drawing a cry of surprise from Igva.</p><br/><p>Zaryusu\u2019s eyeballs swivelled and locked onto Igva. His eyes were clouded, but it was hard to believe that he was not looking directly at him with a smoldering intensity. The sight made Igva freeze up.</p><br/><p>\u201cCrusch! Zenberu! Rororo!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014\u200b! What are you trying to do\u2014\u200b!? Just die\u2014\u200b!\u201d</p><br/><p>Where had he gotten that vitality from? The massive surge of negative energy pouring into him should have been steadily dissolving and consuming Zaryusu\u2019s life force. And indeed, Zaryusu\u2019s limbs felt heavy, and his body seemed frozen.</p><br/><p>Even so, every time he cried their names, Zaryusu felt a flicker of warmth within him. This warmth did not come from his life force.</p><br/><p>Instead, it sprang from a place within his chest \u2014\u200b the heart.</p><br/><p>He could hear the sound of muscles tensing. That sound came from Zaryusu\u2019s right hand, from his tightly clenched fist. He was infusing all his strength into that fist.</p><br/><p>\u2666 \u2666 \u2666</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible\u2014\u200b! How are you still moving!? You monster\u2014\u200b!\u201d</p><br/><p>He was actually capable of moving. That was a truly unbelievable sight.</p><br/><p>Emotions raged within Igva\u2019s heart, but he strove to suppress them.</p><br/><p>He was Igva, the overall commander of the forces of the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick during this expedition, and most importantly, he was the creation of the Supreme Overlord of Death \u2014\u200b Ainz Ooal Gown.</p><br/><p>A mighty being like himself could not possibly be defeated like this\u2014\u200b</p><br/><p>\u201cDie\u2014\u200b!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the end for you, monster!\u201d</p><br/><p>He was faster.</p><br/><p>Yes, the speed of that full-power strike was faster than the rate at which Igva was infusing negative energy\u2014\u200b</p><br/><p>The tightly-clenched fist struck the hilt of Frost Pain\u2014\u200b</p><br/><p>\u2014\u200bAnd Zaryusu\u2019s knuckles bled. Struck by such a heavy blow, the blade pierced clear through Igva\u2019s skull.</p><br/><p>\u201cOhhhhh\u2014!\u201d</p><br/><p>As one of the undead, Igva did not feel pain, but he could still understand that the negative energy which animated him had vanished.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2014\u200bthis\u2026 how could this\u2026 Ain\u2026z\u2026sama\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The full understanding of his failure dawned in Igva\u2019s eyes. As Zaryusu collapsed like a puppet whose strings had been cut, there was a loud splash\u2014\u200b</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Please\u2026 please\u2026 forgive\u2026 me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014And \u200bIgva\u2019s body fell with him, accompanied by the apology to his master.</p><br/><p>\u2666 \u2666 \u2666</p><br/><p>The interior of the room was silent. Nobody could believe what they had just seen, and so nobody spoke. The sole exception was the maid \u2014\u200b Entoma.</p><br/><p>\u201cCocytus-sama, it seems Ainz-sama has sent for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014\u200bUnderstood.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cocytus turned to face Entoma, his head lowered.</p><br/><p>He bit back his shame as his vassals looked upon him with unease.</p><br/><p>But on the other hand, he wanted to offer praise.</p><br/><p>After all, that had been an exciting battle.</p><br/><p>To think the foe had actually turned the impossible into the possible. Granted, the Elder Lich had made some errors in judgement, but under normal circumstances, the Elder Lich should still have won, despite his mistakes.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Amazing. Truly. Amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cocytus repeated those words to express his heartfelt opinion.</p><br/><p>They had hurdled that incredible obstacle.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What. A. Shame,\u201d Cocytus breathed as he watched the Lizardmen dancing and singing in triumph through the mirror.</p><br/><p>The warriors it showed were extremely weak, but they had kindled Cocytus\u2019s fighting spirit.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 What. A. Shame.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cocytus hesitated. He picked out the most frightening scenario from the many in his mind, thought on it, and made a decision.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014\u200bLet\u2019s. Go.\u201d</p><br/><p><b>Part 6</b></p><br/><p>Zaryusu felt like he was being carried out of a world of darkness. It felt good.</p><br/><p>After he opened his eyes, the blurred scene before him reminded him of what he saw when he woke up.</p><br/><p>Where was this place? Why was he sleeping here?</p><br/><p>Countless questions rose within his heart, and then he realised there was a weight resting on him.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u200bWhite.</p><br/><p>Zaryusu looked toward the ball of white. Having just woken up, the word \u201cwhite\u201d was the first thing which came to mind. As he slowly came to, he realized what it was.</p><br/><p>It was Crusch. She had fallen asleep on top of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><i>I\u2019m still alive.</i></p><br/><p>Zaryusu was so relieved that he nearly spoke those words out loud. Yet, he bit down on them. He could not bear to wake up Crusch, and so he resisted the urge to touch her. Her scales might be pretty, but he still could not touch a sleeping female at his whim.</p><br/><p>Zaryusu struggled to chase Crusch\u2019s form out of his mind, and started thinking about other things.</p><br/><p>There were many things to ponder.</p><br/><p>To begin with, what was he doing here?</p><br/><p>He searched his memories, thinking back onto what had happened in the past. The last thing he could recall was the sight of Igva\u2019s defeat, and then there was nothing. However, the fact that he had not been taken captive but was sleeping here meant that the tribes had won.</p><br/><p>Zaryusu gingerly breathed a sigh of relief, careful to avoid waking up Crusch. It felt as though the burden of the past few days had finally lifted off his shoulders, but in truth, there were still some weighty issues remaining.</p><br/><p>However, he wanted to let his heart rest for the time being. Zaryusu savored Crusch\u2019s warmth, and quietly sighed.</p><br/><p>After that Zaryusu experimentally tried his body. He was fully mobile and there were no notable problems. He had thought that he might be crippled in some way, but it would seem he had been very fortunate.</p><br/><p>Just then, he thought of the other friend who had fought by his side. There was nobody else in the room besides Crusch. That being the case, what happened to Zenberu? He felt quite uneasy, but at the same time, a powerful male like Zenberu should be fine.</p><br/><p>Crusch seemed to have been woken up by Zaryusu\u2019s movements, and her body shifted. It seemed as though her soft, limp body had been infused with a soul. She must be about to wake up.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmmn\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Crusch made an adorable noise, and then she looked around with sleep-clouded eyes. Soon, she realised that Zaryusu was underneath her, and smiled in delight.</p><br/><p>\u201cMuu\u2014\u200b\u201d</p><br/><p>After a sleepy-headed Crusch embraced Zaryusu, she began rubbing herself on him. It was as though she was an animal trying to mark him with her scent.</p><br/><p>Zaryusu went stiff and let Crusch do as she pleased. In fact, there was even a wicked voice inside him which said, \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m the one doing it.\u201c</p><br/><p>Her slick white scales were cool and icy. In addition to being very comfortable, they also gave off an alluring aroma of herbs.</p><br/><p>He could hug her too, right?</p><br/><p>Just as he was about to lose control, Crusch came to her senses, and she locked eyes with Zaryusu underneath her.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u200bTime froze.</p><br/><p>Zaryusu scrabbled to think of what to say to Crusch, who was holding him in silence. Finally, he decided on something which ought to be all right:</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014\u200bCan I hug you too?\u201d</p><br/><p>Well, his surging emotions felt that it ought to be all right.</p><br/><p>Crusch yelped in surprise, and her tail thumped over and over against the ground. Then, she practically rolled off Zaryusu, until she hit a wall.</p><br/><p>He could hear a soft moaning from Crusch as she curled up on the ground, going, \u201cstupid stupid I\u2019m so stupid,\u201d or something along those lines.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026In any case, I\u2019m very glad that you\u2019re all right, Crusch.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those words seemed to restore Crusch to some semblance of normalcy (her tail aside), and she looked up and smiled at Zaryusu.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou too, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><br/><p>An untoward thought popped up in Zaryusu\u2019s mind as he looked on Crusch\u2019s gentle face, but he struggled to resist it and asked a more proper question.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know what happened after I collapsed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, a little. The enemy retreated after Igva was defeated, and it seems your brother defeated the monsters successfully, and then the three of us were saved\u2026 that happened yesterday.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, Zenberu\u2026 he\u2019s not here\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, he\u2019s fine. He probably recovered faster than you; he regained consciousness after being magically healed, so now he\u2019s taking care of the post-battle cleanup. I seem to have overworked myself, so I passed out after hearing all that\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Crusch stood up and took a seat beside Zaryusu. He wanted to get up as well, but Crusch gently stopped him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t force yourself to get up. You were the most badly hurt of us, after all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps she was remembering the circumstances then, but Crusch\u2019s voice had gone quiet.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m just happy that you came back in one piece\u2026:\u201d</p><br/><p>Zaryusu gently caressed Crusch \u2014\u200b whose eyes were downcast \u2014\u200b to comfort her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t die before I hear your answer. I was worried for you too.\u201d</p><br/><p>The answer. That word made them freeze.</p><br/><p>Both of them said nothing. The silence in the air was so thick that one could almost hear their hearts pounding.</p><br/><p>Crusch\u2019s tail moved slowly to twine around Zaryusu\u2019s. The way those black and white tails tangled with each other looked like a pair of mating snakes.</p><br/><p>Zaryusu stared at Crusch, and Crusch stared at Zaryusu. They could see themselves in each other\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Zaryusu spoke quietly \u2014\u200b no, that was not speech, but a call. It was the same call he had made the first time he had seen Crusch.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u200bA mating call.</p><br/><p>Zaryusu did nothing besides making that call. No, it would be better to say that he could not do anything. The only thing that moved was his heart, pounding violently within his chest.</p><br/><p>Soon, a similar sound came from Crusch\u2019s mouth \u2014\u200b a call. It was a similarly high-pitched cry, warbling near the end \u2014\u200b the sound of a mating cry which had been accepted.</p><br/><p>There was an indescribably entrancing look on Crusch\u2019s face, and Zaryusu could no longer tear his eyes away from her. Crusch lay down on Zaryusu, the same way she had when she had fallen asleep earlier.</p><br/><p>There was nothing between the two of them now. Their breath and their warmth mingled together. Their heartbeats synched up through their touching chests. In this way the two of them became one\u2014\u200b</p><br/><p>\u2666 \u2666 \u2666</p><br/><p>\u201cOho! Doing it already?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u200bAnd then Zenberu flung the door open and barged in.</p><br/><p>Crusch and Zaryusu froze like a pair of ice statues.</p><br/><p>Zenberu looked down at them \u2014\u200b at Crusch, straddling Zaryusu \u2014\u200b with a look of bafflement on his face, and tilted his head:</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, you haven\u2019t started yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>As they realized what Zenberu was talking about, the two of them separated from each other, then slowly stood up and approached him without a word.</p><br/><p>Zenberu looked thoroughly confused as he bent down to look over the both of them.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014\u200bGuwaaargh!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two fists in his gut knocked the wind out of him, and Zenberu\u2019s massive body keeled over onto the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cUuu\u2026 those were good punches\u2026 especially Crusch\u2019s\u2026 ugggh\u2026 that really hurt\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zaryusu aside, even the female\u2019s fist of fury was enough to defeat Zenberu. While punching him once was not enough to quell her anger, the mood in the air had vanished without a trace and it would not come back even if she kept on hitting him.</p><br/><p>The way they held hands \u2014\u200b as a substitute for beating Zenberu up even more \u2014\u200b was also quite puzzling, but Zaryusu decided to clear up the worries in his heart by asking Zenberu a question.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s leave that aside for now. I have a lot of things to ask you. I asked Crusch just now, but can you tell me what kind of situation we\u2019re in?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zenberu ignored the way they were holding hands and answered:</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know? The tribes are all celebrating.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd my brother is leading them, I assume?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. In any case, the hunters have gone to check, but they didn\u2019t find any signs of the enemy, or any trace of reinforcements left in ambush. After all, mobilizing that many people would grab a lot of attention. Therefore, we\u2019ve decided to stay alert, but your brother has already declared victory. In fact, I\u2019m here on his orders.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAni-ja\u2019s orders?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh yes, your brother told me \u2014\u200b <i>Gahahaha, let them rest a little. For all we know they\u2019re probably fucking like rabbits now. Gahaha, I feel a little bad about interrupting, but I was kind of curious, gahahaha</i>\u2019\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBullshit! What\u2019s with that \u2018gahaha\u2019 laugh, anyway?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026 oh, come to think of it, I don\u2019t think he actually went gahahaha when he laughed\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs if Ani-ja would actually laugh like that, really\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it was just a figure of speech\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014\u200bDisgusting.\u201d</p><br/><p>The words from Crusch\u2019s mouth were frigid enough to rival the sub-zero temperatures of \u300cIcy Burst\u300d. Even Zaryusu was frightened by that terrifying noise. Naturally, Zenberu \u2014\u200b as the target of those words \u2014\u200b froze up in an instant.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, why are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I came to\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you came to stick your nose into our business, I will let you taste the magic you wanted.\u201d</p><br/><p>Crusch was not kidding. Zaryusu and Zenberu were keenly aware of that.</p><br/><p>\u201cEr\u2026 how shall I say this\u2026 I came to invite you two over. We were the key figures in the victory, right? Can\u2019t have you absent. Also, we need to plan for the future together\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Crusch smiled bitterly after hearing Zenberu\u2019s explanation and understanding what it meant. In short: they had to plan for another battle in the future, and now was the best time to show their strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood. Can you go too, Crusch?\u201d</p><br/><p>Crusch had puffed up her cheeks in displeasure, and she looked like a mutant frog of the kind that lived in the marsh. <i>She\u2019s far cuter than one of them, however</i>, Zaryusu thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, shall we?\u201d Zenberu asked the pair \u2014\u200b who were gazing at each other \u2014\u200b in a casual tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 mm. Yes, let\u2019s.\u201d</p><br/><p>After they agreed, the three of them headed outside. Just as they walked down the steps to the hut and set foot onto the marsh, Zaryusu vanished from Zenberu and Crusch\u2019s line of sight. That was because something massive had hit him.</p><br/><p><i>\u2014\u200bdongorogoropashpash\u2014\u200b</i></p><br/><p>That was probably what it sounded like.</p><br/><p>Replacing the disappeared Zaryusu was Rororo\u2019s body. Its four heads writhed energetically, and it nosed at Zaryusu, who had fallen into the marsh.</p><br/><p>\u201cRororo! You\u2019re all right!\u201d</p><br/><p>The mudstained Zaryusu rose to his feet and gently stroked Rororo\u2019s body while examining it. It had apparently received magical healing, because the burns from earlier were completely healed, as though it had never been hurt before.</p><br/><p>Rororo cried out and wrapped its heads playfully around Zaryusu. They bound his entire body, and they seemed to be squeezing quite tightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cOi oi oi, Rororo, stop, please,\u201d</p><br/><p>Zaryusu jokingly begged Rororo to stop, but Rororo simply cried out in joy and refused to let go.</p><br/><p><i>Pasha, pasha, pasha.</i></p><br/><p>Zaryusu suddenly heard the rhythmic sound of splashing. He was baffled when he realised its source.</p><br/><p>Those splashes had come from Crusch, She was smiling gently as she looked at Zaryusu and Rororo, but her tail struck the marsh like a metronome.</p><br/><p>Zenberu \u2014\u200b who had originally been standing by Crusch\u2019s side \u2014\u200b was now distancing himself from her, with a stony look on his face.</p><br/><p>Rororo stopped playing around. It had probably sensed something strange.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, nothing\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zaryusu looked at Crusch, who was quite confused. He did not understand. No matter how it looked, Crusch seemed to be smiling at Rororo and Zaryusu\u2019s reunion, but for some reason it sent a chill down his spine.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow strange\u2014\u200b\u201d</p><br/><p>Crusch smiled again.</p><br/><p>Rororo let go of Zaryusu, who was thus liberated, while Zenberu looked on nervously. Perhaps he was unable to bear the creepy atmosphere any further, but Zenberu hurriedly decided to change the topic.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, Rororo, come with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rororo could not understand what the Lizardmen were saying, but it looked like it did. After Zenberu mounted up, it immediately dashed off with surprising speed.</p><br/><p>After the two of them left, the same sinister air hung between Zaryusu and Crusch.</p><br/><p>She grabbed her head, and shook it.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhh, really, what am I doing, it feels like my heart doesn\u2019t belong to me any more. I know it\u2019s a small thing, but I can\u2019t control myself. Mm, it\u2019s like a curse.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zaryusu could understand how she felt. Indeed, he had felt the same way when he had first met her.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrankly speaking, Crusch \u2014\u200b I\u2019m very happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014\u200bWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Pasha!</i> A splash that was louder than usual rang out. Then, Zaryusu went to Crusch\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>\u201cListen, can you hear it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe things we\u2019ve protected, and the things we have to protect in future.\u201d</p><br/><p>The wind carried a joyful noise upon it. There must have been a wine feast going on. It would be a feast to send back the ancestral spirits, celebrate their victories, and to give the dead their due.</p><br/><p>Under normal circumstances, wine was a very valuable commodity. The fact they could host so many feasts over these few days was because Zenberu and his tribe had brought one of the Four Treasures along, which was why they could enjoy unlimited alcohol. In addition, the almost unbelievable festive mood now was because everyone from the tribes was gathered here.</p><br/><p>Zaryusu laughed to Crusch as he heard their revelry:</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s not over yet. Maybe that Supreme One guy will attack again. Even so\u2026 let\u2019s relax a little today.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, Zaryusu put his arm around Crusch\u2019s waist.</p><br/><p>Crusch allowed Zaryusu\u2019s strength to hold her close, and then she leaned her head on Zaryusu\u2019s shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cShall we?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, Crusch hesitated briefly before quietly adding, \u201c\u2026Darling.\u201d</p><br/><p>Leaning against each other, the two Lizardmen vanished into the commotion</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Now that he was released from the stress of battle, he realized that he was so hungry that his stomach ached.</p><br/><p><i><span>\u2026If I made Stronoff wait for me while he was hungry, I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll live this down.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>He opened the house\u2019s door. Naturally, Gazef had permitted Brain to treat this home like it was his own.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>As Brain entered the house and walked towards the room which Gazef had lent him, he heard the sound of footsteps heading in his direction. Someone must have heard him coming in.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>He guessed that it was Gazef, and when the person making those footsteps came down the stairs, his guess was proven correct.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWell, you\u2019re back late, Unglaus. Did you go anywhere?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Gazef\u2019s question held no hint of a rebuke. In fact, as Brain fell into contemplation about how to answer that question, Gazef instead looked upon him with eyes that were bright with interest.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, how about talking over dinner?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>That idea sat just fine with Brain. He rubbed his belly and laughed.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s a great idea. Where shall we eat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Gazef looked surprised for a moment, and then he led Brain to the dining room, saying \u201cover here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAre you going to have the servants make something? Or don\u2019t tell me, you\u2019re going to cook yourself, Stronoff?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Gazef smiled bitterly at that unexpected question.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t cook at all.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Saying so, he pursed his lips into a cat-smile, and added:</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHowever, everything my servants make is pretty bland, probably because they\u2019re getting on in years. In my line of work, I\u2019d like to eat things with strong flavours\u2026 but they just don\u2019t seem to get it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Brain chuckled, and teased: \u201cSo even the great and mighty Warrior-Captain of the Kingdom is forced to eat bland, healthy fare?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Gazef did not protest this, merely frowned and replied: \u201cIndeed.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Then he continued: \u201cWhile i\u2019d thought of letting you try my famous home-cooked food, in the end I ordered take-out.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIs that so. That\u2019s very kind of you. Thanks.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Brain smiled thinly as he said this. It seemed to amuse Gazef, who chuckled. Then, he shot back:</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCan you cook then, Unglaus?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>However, that riposte went wide.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWell, it\u2019s nothing much, but I can throw together simple dishes. After all, it\u2019d be pretty hard to get by if I couldn\u2019t cook on my own while training.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI see,\u201d Gazef answered as they entered the dining room, whereupon he picked up the basket placed near the wall.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>It seemed large enough to hold a baby, and a fragrance wafted out from inside, stimulating the nose and belly.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The two of them sat down, facing each other.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>After setting several dishes on the table, they raised glasses filled with wine and clinked them together. There was no special occasion for the toast. They simply glugged the wine down in silence.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>A refreshing flavor spread from their mouths.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>After about two mouthfuls, Brain put the glass down. He coughed and said in an earnest tone:</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2026It\u2019s been a long time since I had wine.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSame here. Or rather, I should say I haven\u2019t eaten at home in a while.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2026Working in the Palace is hard, huh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot for the Warrior-Captain to do.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAre you in charge of the Royal Family\u2019s security too?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes. It\u2019s what I do for the most part.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Brain could sense Gazef\u2019s upright nature through his words. It would be fine to lapse a little, but he insisted on sticking to his guns.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i><span>The nobles must hate commoners like this.</span></i></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>It would seem Brain\u2019s guess was on the mark, because Gazef very rarely mentioned the nobles. Despite his lofty station of the Kingdom\u2019s Warrior-Captain, Gazef mainly talked about his military duties or how he served the Royal Family. There was hardly any talk of the decadent world of ballrooms and banquets.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>An imposing social barrier still separated noble from commoner, though this practice had largely vanished in the nearby Empire.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Brain suddenly found it all very amusing. </span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>In the past, he had honed his sword skills to defeat Gazef, and he had selfishly thought that \u201cthe next time we meet will be a battle to the death\u201d. Yet the two of them were now friends who could share a drink.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Perhaps Gazef had picked up on his thoughts, but the other man smiled too.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>They clinked their glasses together. Perhaps the wine was starting to get to them, but they used a bit too much force and the wine spilled out, soaking the table.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOi oi, don\u2019t spill it on the food.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDon\u2019t you think the wine\u2019ll make it taste better?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWell, my tongue\u2019s pretty bad so it\u2019s all one to me\u2026 is it the same for you, Unglaus?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBrain. Call me Brain.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cReally now. Call me Gazef, then.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGot it, Gazef.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The two of them looked and each other and laughed, and there was a clear ringing note as their glasses clinked together again.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Gazef brought up all manner of topics, and Brain soon found himself in unfamiliar territory. As they were getting into it, Gazef nonchalantly asked:</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCome to think of it, how did a man like you end up like that, Brain?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>He asked that question carefully, as though afraid of reopening old wounds. His penetrating gaze did not appear to be testing the truth of his words. He seemed genuinely worried about hurting Brain\u2019s feelings.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cMm, thanks.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Gazef froze at Brain\u2019s unbidden thanks. Perhaps that face of his was amusing, but Brain\u2019s own expression softened a little. Then, he straightened himself up and said:</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2026I saw a monster.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cA monster? Some kind of magical beast, maybe?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI think it was a Vampire\u2026 her name was Shalltear Bloodfallen. With just her pinky finger she managed to deflect the move I invented\u2026 to defeat you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Brain sensed that Gazef\u2019s eyes had slightly widened.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2026Is that so.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Those words were accompanied by a savage smile. Brain knew well what that smile meant.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>It was the desire of any warrior to defeat a mighty foe.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Brain had once felt that way about Gazef. Gazef had probably wanted to fight Brain as well, to re-experience that pitched exciting battle from back then\u2014</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>However, that bestial grin promptly vanished. In its place was the smile of the Kingdom\u2019s Warrior-Captain.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Brain described the Vampire\u2019s appearance, but Gazef replied that he had never heard of her before. Then he took a mouthful of wine. Brain had a sip himself, and then described their battle \u2014 no, of how she had trampled him underfoot.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>However, he stayed away from the topic of being employed by the Death-Spreading Brigade. He felt that Gazef might say \u201cevery man walks his own path in life\u201d, but the truth was that in front of a righteous man like Gazef, Brain felt ashamed of mentioning the depths to which his past self had sank in pursuit of sword skills.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>There was no doubt in Gazef\u2019s eyes after he had heard the whole thing.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDo you believe me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2026The world\u2019s a big place, after all. It wouldn\u2019t be strange if such a monster did exist. When you look back at history, there were things like the Demon Gods and the Dragon Lords. Still\u2026 I don\u2019t think I could beat such a powerful monster either.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes. I don\u2019t know how strong you are now so I can\u2019t really comment, but I\u2019m still certain that you can\u2019t beat her. She lives in a world which people like us can\u2019t even approach. Even if the two of us attacked at once, all we\u2019d manage to do is draw the battle out from one second to two.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be comforting me and saying \u2018no, it\u2019s alright\u2019 or something?\u201d Gazef mock-complained.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>However, Brain sternly told him:</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGazef. You have to protect the royal family as the Kingdom\u2019s Warrior-Captain. Don\u2019t challenge her even if you see her. You can\u2019t waste your life like that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThank you for your advice. However, if that monster called Shalltear strikes at the Kingdom, I will throw my life away even if all it does is buy some time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i><span>What time could he buy? Gazef would be helpless before her unless she wanted to play.</span></i></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Even so, Brain began to feel that Gazef might be able to do it, even if it was just to buy some time.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cShe\u2019s called Shalltear. Shalltear Bloodfallen.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>After Brain described her appearance once more, Gazef nodded gravely. </span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cRight, I got it. However, you\u2019d best tell me again once I recover from the wine, just to be safe. I\u2019ll learn as much as I can about her too.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI don\u2019t think any amount of learning is going to help against her.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIf we know a storm is coming, shouldn\u2019t we try to do something about it? Can\u2019t just leave things be. Besides, we might be able to come up with something if we can pick enough brains.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIf only that were the case.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019m not too close to him, but I know an adamantite-ranked adventurer. He ought to be able to come up with something useful\u2026 anyway, what do you plan to do in the future, Brain?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Brain\u2019s eyebrows knitted at that question. What </span><i><span>should</span></i><span> he do?</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>His eyes unconsciously drifted to his beloved\u300cKatana\u300dbeside the table.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>It was lingering attachment. </span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Ultimately, that was all it was. No matter how much he tried, he would never be able to beat that monster. His dream of becoming the greatest swordsman was in ruins. He had indeed wasted his life.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>From now on, he would have to keep his feet firmly on the ground and live his life correctly.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i><span>It was just a childish dream\u2026</span></i></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat should I do, huh\u2026 what about working on a farm?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>He had been born in a farming village, and while he had forgotten much about agriculture, the knowledge still lingered in the recesses of his mind. The only other thing he knew besides that was swordsmanship. Put in a nicer way, he had lived a very focused life.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cFarming\u2026 well, that\u2019s not bad, but\u2026 how about this? Why not serve the nation with me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Brain did not think it was a bad idea. He might not be able to beat that monster called Shalltear, but he considered himself quite capable in terms of human-scale ability. However\u2014</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019m not a very sociable person, and I\u2019m not into the bowing and scraping business.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t bow and scrape </span><i><span>that</span></i><span> much\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAh, sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to make fun of you. Just that the thought of serving in the court made me think of that sort of thing\u2026 In truth, I think that\u2019s a pretty good idea, Gazef. Fighting for others\u2026 that\u2019s it! Oi, Gazef, I met a boy called Climb.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cClimb? That hoarse-voiced kid?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Gazef went \u201cohhhhhh\u201d as he saw Brain nod.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhere did you meet Climb? I thought he was the Princess\u2019 bodyguard, so he shouldn\u2019t have had many chances to leave her side\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI saw him training on the streets.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cTraining on the streets, huh\u2026 well, he just doesn\u2019t have talent. I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll get any stronger than he is now. All he can do now is train his body and improve his physical attributes. Was he doing that? If not, I might have to guide him a little.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHm \u2014 indeed\u2026 he\u2019s got no talent for swordsmanship. However, he\u2019s stronger than me in some areas.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The look on Gazef\u2019s face seemed to say \u201care you kidding me\u201d.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Indeed, Brain was far more skilled than Climb, and more talented as well. However, Brain knew that this discrepancy meant nothing in the face of true power, and so he felt that laughing at Climb for it would be hypocritical.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Rather than quibble about such a trifling difference, Brain felt that Climb\u2019s strong will \u2014 which had withstood the murderous intent of the mighty Sebas \u2014 was truly worthy of praise.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i><span>I was beaten and chose to flee. But Climb would never run if someone he had to protect was behind him. He would choose to fight. Perhaps a man like him\u2026 could clip that monster\u2019s nail.</span></i></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Brain did not say anything about Gazef\u2019s confused expression. Instead, he roughly explained the day\u2019s events; in other words, the raid on the Eight Fingers brothel.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI see. So you and Climb\u2026 I see.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou can abandon me if you think it\u2019ll cause problems. I mean, when you think about it, having someone like me who goes in and out of your house is going to cause you trouble if I\u2019m at odds with the underworld, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo, not at all. In fact, I rather welcome it\u2026 those bastards are the maggots infesting the Kingdom. I would like nothing more than to carve my way into their headquarters.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAre Eight Fingers so bad for the Kingdom?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThey make me want to throw up. They control most of the secret societies in the Kingdom and profit from them. The money and benefits go to the nobles, allowing those rogues to mix with them and swan around in normal society. If we try to arrest them, the nobles obstruct us, so there\u2019s nothing we can do on that front. The only way we can hurt them is by doing what you did, Brain. We need to barge into their cunningly concealed hideouts, force their criminal acts into the light, and make a big fuss of things. Of course, they\u2019re more powerful than the average noble, so if we fail, the consequences will be severe.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou\u2019re out of luck, then?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIndeed. Therefore, I hope what you did weakens them. Unfortunately, that\u2019s not too likely.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCan\u2019t you have the King issue a royal decree or something?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe nobles opposing him will interfere from the sidelines, so we can\u2019t do it. And they have allies in both factions, which makes things even trickier.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>As the air hung heavily over the table, the two of them drank their wine in silence and reached for the food.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><b>Part 2</b></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><b>Lower Fire Month (9th Month) 4th Day 07:14</b></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>The members of Blue Rose had entered the keep early in the morning. Each of them carried a large sack, which made metallic clattering noises when put on the ground. The sacks contained all their gear, because entering the Royal Palace all girded for war was not very appropriate.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>After putting down their weighty luggage, the group rotated their shoulders. Renner looked kindly upon them, and their team leader, Lakyus Alvein Dale Aindra, asked her: </span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWill you have any princessly duties to discharge later?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Renner had hardly any power, but she still had her responsibilities as the princess.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Those matters can wait. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAha.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>A mischievous expression came over Lakyus\u2019 face. Similarly, Renner also flashed her a mischievous look, which then melted into unrestrained laughter.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cLakyus. Once you\u2019re ready, I\u2019d like to ask you to take care of that matter as soon as possible.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhy? I heard yesterday that we were going to attack in secret, taking each location in turn. Isn\u2019t that so?\u201d asked Evileye, the masked arcane magic caster.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>She had not removed her face-concealing mask even in the Royal Palace. She had not been censured for such suspicious dress because she was an adamantite-ranked adventurer, the elite of humanity, and also because her team leader Lakyus was a member of the peerage.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSomething unexpected happened last night, so I feel we need to change part of the plan. It\u2019s like this\u2014\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Renner described the brothel raid from last night. </span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Climb stood stock still behind Renner, and the members of Blue Rose looked upon him with respectful eyes. Their gazes made him feel itchy.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Charging into the brothel and saving people from their hellish confines was not Climb\u2019s doing. He had merely borrowed the strength of the two men who had gone in with him. Frankly speaking, Climb had done nothing worthy of praise.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Instead, he felt disappointed with himself. He had not been rebuked for his reckless, independent action and the plan had not been cancelled, only altered. The fact that he actually felt relieved by that only made it that much more tragic.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNot bad, cherry boy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYup, Gagaran\u2019s right. Apprehending a member of Six Arms is a pretty big deal.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2026\u2019Undying King\u2019 Davernoc. \u2018Void Cutter\u2019 Peysilian. \u2018Bloody Scimitar\u2019 Edstrom. \u2018Thousand Kills\u2019 Malmvist. \u2018Illusion Devil\u2019 Succulent. And then their leader, \u2018Battle Demon\u2019 Zero.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Tia smoothly recited each name.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDavernoc is undead. Peysilian is said to be able to cut down even distant foes. Edstrom can skilfully use special magic weapons. Malmvist is a fencer with a poisoned blade, adept at lunges. Succulent has already been apprehended. And Zero is a brawler who excels in empty-handed combat. Each of them is equivalent to an adamantite-ranked adventurer.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cMmm. Catching one of them is a big aid to us.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAmazing work, Climb. Still, it was great good fortune that you met Brain Unglaus and fought by his side,\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>Climb agreed with that sentiment.</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe fact that he could take out Succulent in one hit proves that Unglaus \u2014 the man who fought the Kingdom\u2019s strongest warrior (Gazef Stronoff) to a standstill \u2014 is the real deal. That said, I\u2019m more interested in that old butler which even he couldn\u2019t beat.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI didn\u2019t get Sebas-sama\u2019s address\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><strong></strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2026Hm, Climb. Did he not tell you because he was wary of you, or did you not ask because you knew you should not have asked\u2026 which is it?\u201d</span><span></span></p><br/><p>\n</p></div>"}

He thought that way when he forgot to do his homework and had to raise his hand up on the first day of school in September.</p><br/><p>However, this time, I made it real!</p><br/><p>My childhood dream came true! Maruyama wanted to become an adult like this in the past, and now it\u2019s become reality! Oh what a wonderful thing!</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s \u2014 I guess I should stop here. Spouting these pointless excuses to drag things out won\u2019t help things.</p><br/><p>Therefore, while it was slightly delayed, we managed to publish the book at last. Well, this ought to be within the margin of error. No, the truth is that it was because a lot of things happened. Seriously, there were a lot of them both good and bad.</p><br/><p>Speaking of which, Maruyama bought several ebooks while in hospital, ebooks are really great! I didn\u2019t expect them to be handy. I think it would be good for Overlord to have an ebook version. Therefore, I have decided to convert Overlord into a digital format. As I thought, there are many things that humans won\u2019t understand if they don\u2019t try them out. Similarly, if you are not involved in a situation, there\u2019s many things you won\u2019t understand about it.</p><br/><p>Incidentally, while this is offtopic, the ebooks I read were manga, specifically love comedies.</p><br/><p>Now then, last of all, I need to thank a lot of people. In particular, the people holding this book, as well as a certain hospital.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll be glad if I can meet you again in the next volume. Thank you very much, everyone.</p><br/><p>September 2017Maruyama Kugane</p><br/>\n</div>"}

There was the person in charge of the surviving priests, a middle-aged man who could use third tier spells \u2014 Siliaco Naranho. And then there was Prince Caspond Bessarez.</div><div class=\"western\">Two of them had come from the battlefield and one of them had been in charge of healing the wounded. As a result, Prince Caspond\u2019s room was filled with the stench of blood.</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios had not removed her helmet even now. That was not proper etiquette for visiting a prince\u2019s chambers at all \u2014 one could even call it disrespectful \u2014 but Caspond did not seem bothered by it and he appeared very calm.</div><div class=\"western\">At the same time, the atmosphere in the room was terrible, though not because of the preceding point. It was true that it reeked in here, but the reason was because the mood in the air was harsh. It was so weighty that it even seemed to dull the sunlight entering through the window.</div><div class=\"western\">This was not how people who had beaten overwhelmingly unfavorable odds and emerged victorious ought to be.</div><div class=\"western\">Caspond was the first person to speak in this weighty silence. Still, who else could speak first but him?</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThen tell me about our casualty situation.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cOf the 6,000 militiamen we brought onto the battlefield, roughly 2,400 of them have been injured or killed.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026If I may add to the Vice Captain-dono\u2019s words, there were around 1,000 wounded. The priests tried to heal them, but we failed to reach about half of them in time and they died.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026And then half of the paladins survived, and eight priests died.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Caspond closed his eyes and shook his head as he heard Gustav\u2019s words.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAgainst a demihuman army like that\u2026 while we can\u2019t say losses like these are a good thing, should we be grateful that those were all we took? Or should we be sad for the sheer number of casualties\u2014\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThe latter.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios\u2019s still, small voice interrupted Caspond.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThe latter.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026Captain Custodio is right. We ought to be sad to have suffered such losses.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Gustav and Siliaco looked down as they heard Caspond\u2019s words.</div><div class=\"western\">They knew that it was a miracle \u2014 albeit a man-made one \u2014 that the woefully outnumbered Holy Kingdom Liberation Army had so many survivors when they had taken on a 40,000-strong army of demihumans. However, they also understood that saying something like this would be disruptive and unproductive, so they had no choice but to do this instead.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWas it the Sorcerer King who defeated the demihuman forces in their formation?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYes. We\u2019re unsure about the details due to the of lack eyewitness reports during the chaos of defending the city walls, but there\u2019s talk of mysterious undead beings destroying the army.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI see. That matches up with what I heard from the Sorcerer KIng. So he used the undead he created to clean them up \u2014 wiped out a massive army like that, hm? In that case\u2026 do you think the Sorcerer King can defeat Jaldabaoth?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Caspond shifted his gaze to Remedios, but she simply pursed her lips and remained silent. The highly volatile air around the Holy KIngdom\u2019s strongest paladin made her a figure of dread to the weak. Caspond turned away from her and toward Gustav, who immediately returned his gaze with a deeply apologetic look in his eyes and bowed his head.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHahh\u2026 is it really alright to bet the entire KIngdom on him? Or rather \u2014 should we think of what to do if the Sorcerer King loses to Jaldabaoth? Does anyone have any ideas for the next best thing we can do if that comes to pass?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">He was answered by silence. Amidst all this, Remedios spoke up.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIn that case, how about calling Momon over?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The three people other than Remedios looked at each other with severe expressions on their faces.</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios \u2014 who felt it was a good idea \u2014 frowned.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWhat? Do you have any better ideas? It\u2019s more proper than that damn undead, no?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026Captain. We are now discussing what to do if the Sorcerer King dies. In such a situation, expecting to go to the Sorcerous Kingdom to get more help would be very risky.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cNot necessarily,\u201d Siliaco said as he stroked his white moustache.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cA moment please, Vice Captain-dono. The Captain-dono\u2019s idea is risky, but not a bad move. How about lying about the Sorcerer King being captured by Jaldabaoth and getting Momon to come over?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cPriest-dono, that would be too dangerous. Even if Momon defeated Jaldabaoth, discovery of the lie could trigger a war. Even if all goes well, the Sorcerous Kingdom\u2019s impression of our country will plunge to rock bottom. And if things go badly, Momon might very well become a second Jaldabaoth and lead the Sorcerous Kingdom\u2019s undead army into our nation.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cPrecisely, you two. And the worst thing is that the Sorcerous Kingdom will have a justified grievance against us.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios tilted her head at Caspond\u2019s explanation.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWe\u2019re not adjacent to the Sorcerous Kingdom, so that\u2019s okay, right?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026Captain Custodio, please stop thinking of dangerous things. I don\u2019t want to adopt any policies that will endanger us\u2026 that said, I don\u2019t have any good ideas. How about you two?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Siliaco and Gustav could not think of anything either.</div><div class=\"western\">The room was plunged into a brief silence.</div><div class=\"western\">Eventually, Caspond quietly spoke up.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026For the time being, let\u2019s each go back and think about it on our own. There\u2019ll be no problems if the Sorcerer King can defeat Jaldabaoth.\u201d Caspond clapped his hands together. \u201cThen let\u2019s talk about something else. What about the rations that the demihumans brought? Can we eat them normally? And if we can consume them, how long can they last?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Normally, they would belong to the Sorcerer King since he had defeated the demihuman army, but he had already said that he would hand them over free of charge.</div><div class=\"western\">Gustav answered. He was in charge of sundry tasks like that.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThere seem to be a lot of hardened bread-like objects and vegetables that we should be able to eat. Thanks to the attack of the Sorcerer King\u2019s undead creatures, they were captured intact, so they are in very good condition. In addition, there are also some food items which need to be further investigated, such as sour-smelling vegetables and so on.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Preserved food was very common in the Holy Kingdom. However, these were demihuman rations, so they might belong to a species which ate rotting food, which was why Gustav said they had to investigate further.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThere is only one problem. That would be the meat.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWhich means?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Gustav\u2019s face was dark as he looked at Caspond.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cA portion of the meat looks like it came from humans. That conclusion came from looking at its shape and we\u2019re not certain about it. Maybe we could tell if we ate it, but I\u2019d rather not sample it, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHow much meat are we talking about here?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Siliaco had a disgusted look on his face.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cMany demihumans eat meat, so there was a lot of it. At a glance, it seems like half of the rations they brought were meat.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWhat!? Half of the rations for an army of 40,000 troops is meat?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Hypothetically, if a demihuman ate a kilogram of meat a day, that would make 40 tons. If they had enough for two weeks, that would be 560 tons. In that case \u2014 the Prince grabbed his face.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026How much of that is human meat?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWe don\u2019t know. Checking each and every piece would take a lot of time, and if they aren\u2019t in their original shapes\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIt would be a shame to pointlessly discard food when the future seems grim. I would like to separate the human meat from the other meat\u2026 Priest Naranho, can your spells do anything on that front?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cMy apologies, Prince. We cannot do something like that. I feel my colleagues among the paladins should be the same way.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Caspond saw Gustav nod and sighed deeply.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cSo magic can\u2019t do everything huh? How about having the captive demihumans eat it to find out?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWe should let the dead rest in peace. If there\u2019s human meat, we ought to return it to the earth.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cExactly, Captain Custodio\u2026 what do you think, Vice-Captain Montagnes?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYes, I agree with the Captain. I feel that no matter what, we won\u2019t have enough time to investigate each and every barrel of meat. We ought to use our time and effort on other areas.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI see\u2026 very well, I understand. So with regards to the demihuman meat, we\u2019ll dispose of everything that looks questionable. In that case how about the demihumans\u2019 arms and armor?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The Sorcerer King had also handed them over for free, but he had also said that that he would be expecting something in gratitude, so they would have to hand over the appropriate items if the time came.</div><div class=\"western\">If they could defeat Jaldabaoth or take back the Royal Capital, Caspond planned to announce to the people that he would be handing the nation\u2019s riches over to the Sorcerous Kingdom.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cFirstly, recovering the equipment from the demihumans and burying the corpses will need time, therefore we won\u2019t even have time to check their quality\u2026 Priest-dono, if any undead spring up here, will they become the Sorcerer King\u2019s minions?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Undead spawned easily in places where many people died. A place where more than 10,000 demihumans had died fit perfectly.</div><div class=\"western\">Upon being addressed, a profoundly distressed look appeared on Siliaco\u2019s face.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI do not know. I truly do not know. But anything could happen, so we ought to deal with the bodies and sanctify the land as soon as possible. I would like to rely on our strength alone for that, but we simply cannot manage that way, so I would like to get some help from the paladins.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAhh, leave it to us. We\u2019re used to dealing with the undead, after all.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI\u2019d expect no less from Captain Remedios, it puts my heart at ease\u2026 If only the Holy Queen-sama or Kelart-sama were here\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Everyone fell silent as Siliaco\u2019s words tapered off.</div><div class=\"western\">After what seemed like a period of silent prayer, Caspond spoke.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAh, something on that point, Vice-Captain Montagnes. The Sorcerer King seems to want to take the magic items back to his nation, so he picked them out first. Of course, he\u2019ll return anything that belongs to the Holy Kingdom.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cUnderstood. That said, while we have some knowledge of swords and armor, we\u2019ll have difficulty with other items. If anyone here has knowledge of magical items, I would like them to step up and help.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI could help when it comes to items passed down through the royal family. As for religious items, though\u2014\u201d Siliaco nodded as Caspond looked to him. \u201c\u2014In that case, we\u2019ll go get helpers from among the civilians. Still, this was really unexpected. No, we should say it was more than we hoped for. We ought to thank the Sorcerer King\u2019s power for surpassing our expectations.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Nobody present voiced any objections. Amidst the silence, Caspond spoke again, like he was their representative.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThis city did not fall thanks to the Sorcerer King\u2019s power.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">There was a very audible sound of teeth grinding, and Caspond looked worriedly at Gustav.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAfter this, I will need to thank him on behalf of the Holy Kingdom. When the time comes, I hope you will all be present\u2026 in any event, being able to draw on the Sorcerer King\u2019s power and achieve victory is a joyous occasion.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWe did our best too. Don\u2019t forget that.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios\u2019s words seemed to freeze the air in the room. No, it was two people who had frozen up; Gustav and Siliaco.</div><div class=\"western\">Gustav\u2019s mouth opened and closed like a koi. He looked like he had no idea how to apologize for his superior\u2019s outburst.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026Indeed. Captain Remedios, it is a fact that we would not have won this battle without the fierce resistance that you and the people put up.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Caspond saw Remedios nod, and then he continued speaking,</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHowever \u2014 it is also a fact that without the Sorcerer King\u2019s help, we would have lost, and it is just as true that he could have won by himself. Am I wrong?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios savagely ripped off her helmet and flung it at the wall, making a loud <i>bang</i>.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYour Highness! Did something happen!?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The door to the room flew open, and the paladins on guard outside rushed in.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cNothing happened. Continue waiting outside.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The paladins\u2019 eyes went back and forth between Remedios\u2019s helmet and the look on her face, and they realized what had happened. After indicating that they understood, they quietly left the room.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cCaptain Custodio, please do not get worked up. I ask you to be calm.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHow can I be calm!? Almost everyone I\u2019ve met on the way here was praising him! It\u2019s as though he won the whole thing by himself! Didn\u2019t he only show up halfway? How many people died before he won!? That was a victory paid for by the lives of the people, the paladins, the priests, men, women, elderly, and children!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios glared at Caspond.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIt\u2019s not true that he won by himself!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cCaptain!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Gustav could no longer hide his fear at the way Remedios was acting in front of the prince. Remedios had never been one for thinking, but at the very least she was smart enough to know who was her superior. However, things were different now \u2014 she seemed like a pain-maddened beast.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThat bony bastard was flying around in the sky when it was all over to show himself off! Is war a game to him!?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026Captain Custodio, it seems witnessing the deaths of so many of the smallfolk has upset you. Would you like to take a rest?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">In response to Caspond\u2019s mature answer, Gustav shot the man a grateful look.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cBefore that, there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve been thinking of. I\u2019m sure Jaldabaoth and the Sorcerer King are in league with each other.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The three people other than Remedios looked at each other.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cDo you have a single fact to back that up, Captain-dono?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Siliaco looked coolly at Remedios. If one looked calmly at what she had done until now, she was clearly saying that because she hated the Sorcerer King and wanted to bring him down. Now was not the time to let one\u2019s personal preferences dictate one\u2019s decisions.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIsn\u2019t he the only one gaining from this? Both the demihumans and the people of the Holy Kingdom are dead. He \u2014 the Sorcerous Kingdom is wearing away at our fighting strength in order to someday take control of the nation and the hills! That\u2019s why he came here!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026I see. That certainly makes sense from the perspective of profit. What do the two of you think?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Gustav furrowed his brows as he answered Caspond\u2019s question.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThe Sorcerer King came here because we asked him. Also, was it not the Captain\u2019s suggestion to have the two of them fight?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026Indeed it was. That masked bitch in Blue Rose is also one of them. If not for what she said, we would never have gone to the Sorcerous Kingdom. If not for that suggestion, we would have gone to the Empire or the Theocracy. And who knows, he might have come anyway even if we didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Haaaaah,</i> Caspond sighed deeply.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cCaptain Custodio, your logic has been nothing but self-serving from the start. You\u2019re simply twisting the facts to match what you\u2019re saying. I recall the Sorcerer King saying he wanted the maid demons, am I wrong?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026Please forgive me for saying these things which are unbecoming of a priest. I hear that those maid demons are quite powerful. In that case, I can understand why the Sorcerer King would like to obtain them. Demons do not need to eat or drink and they do not have a maximum lifespan. Being able to dominate such powerful demons might be better than gaining an army.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIn that case, it would mean the Sorcerer King is aiding our nation because he felt there was sufficient value in it. It is only common sense for a king who rules a nation.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cStill, nobody\u2019s seen those maid demons before, right!?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">As Remedios screamed while in the grip of her emotions, Caspond looked at her like she was a pitiful, sad child.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cCaptain Custodio. I would like to have a reasoned conversation with you, and not an emotional one\u2026 but it seems you are tired. Go and rest. That is an order.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The red-faced Remedios still looked like she wanted to shriek something else, but Caspond was a step ahead of her and continued speaking.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cGo visit the wounded men. That\u2019s part of your duties as a field commander, am I wrong?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026I understand.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios picked up her helmet and left the room.</div><div class=\"western\">There was no way to describe how the air in the room relaxed after that. It felt like the sense of fatigue one would have after a storm had passed and all the pieces had been picked up, mixed with a sense of relief at the fact that one had managed to survive.</div><div class=\"western\">However, one man was not finished yet.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYour Highness! I sincerely apologize for Captain Custodio\u2019s actions!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Caspond smiled bitterly to Gustav as the latter bowed his head.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIt must have been really hard on you too. However, could you think about the future too? I honestly have no idea what\u2019s going to become of this country after this war is over. If only we could find my sister, the Holy Queen\u2026 what happened to the Holy Queen during the battle of Kalinsha? Did you hear anything from Captain Custodio?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Gustav was Remedios\u2019s personal assistant. Therefore, he would have been present when Remedios told Caspond about it.</div><div class=\"western\">The fact that he knew but was asking again proved one thing \u2014 the prince suspected that Remedios might have been lying to him.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026My Prince, I heard the same thing from Captain Custodio that she told Your Highness when we met for the first time.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">She had been sent flying by a shockwave and when she came to, the Holy Queen and her sister \u2014 Kelart Custodio \u2014 were nowhere to be seen. Although there were corpses of paladins and adventurers and priests everywhere, the bodies of those two were nowhere to be found.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIs that so? Maybe I was worrying too much\u2026 Captain Custodio does not seem like one of those people who say one thing and mean another. It would be better if they were captured by him. If they were killed\u2026 the matter of the succession would become very complicated.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Startled, Siliaco asked him a question.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cCaspond-sama, are you tired of the position of Holy King?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAre you flattering me? In truth that might be the case if my sister had perished of an accident under normal circumstances. However, things are different now. The North is tired and the South still has the ability to fight. In that case, it\u2019s very likely that the South might support someone else to be Holy King. Frankly speaking, it\u2019s very likely that one of the great nobles from the South might end up as Holy King.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWhat!?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Caspond smiled as he looked at Siliaco\u2019s shocked face.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI don\u2019t think that should come as such a surprise\u2026 in that case, with regard to what Vice-Captain Montagnes said earlier, if things go well, the first thing the Southern nobles will do is request that Captain Custodio take responsibility for the whole affair and place her under house arrest.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWhy would they do that?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThen I\u2019ll ask you, Vice-Captain Montagnes \u2014 why would they not do that? Is a paladin who failed to protect Her Majesty not the perfect outlet for their unhappiness? And of course, that\u2019s not the only reason either. She can beat an army single-handedly. In that case, surely defanging your enemy is a basic tactic in warfare, am I wrong?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThe enemy!? Who\u2019s the enemy!?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThe enemies of the Southern nobles. In other words, the Holy Queen\u2019s faction. Remedios Custodio was a confidant of the Holy Queen. Surely the paladins she leads would also be seen as the enemy, am I wrong?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIn that case, what about the priests that Kelart Custodio-sama led?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWhile there are priests who climbed the ranks thanks to their connections with the Southern nobles\u2026 don\u2019t you think that would be the case too? Priestly magic is indispensable in everyday life. While I feel that anyone knows how stupid it is to put someone incompetent in high office, people sometimes do things that can only be described as foolish by others.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cMy Prince\u2026 what should we do?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cVice-Captain Montagnes, what do you mean by that? Do you want to keep her from being placed under house arrest? Or do you want to keep the paladins from getting involved?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI want a better future for the Holy Kingdom.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026We need to find my sister. Then, we need an achievement that all the people will accept as having saved the nation. For instance, by driving out the enemy without having to draw on the strength of the South.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThat\u2019s impossible\u2026 we can\u2019t possibly win without the Sorcerer King\u2019s power.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Caspond looked at Gustav, who was complaining unconsciously, and shrugged.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cStill, that <i>has</i> to be done. Otherwise there won\u2019t be any way to stop the pressure from the South after we win. Hm, yes, or we could damage the South as badly as the North. All that matters is that the balance of power is preserved in the end.\u201d Caspond looked up at the ceiling. \u201cIf only we\u2019d made a deal with the South sooner. She was too kind for her own good. And I understand how all this might have struck a nerve with Captain Custodio. After all, the only one who looked good in this battle was the Sorcerer King. If things go badly, the Sorcerer King might end up becoming the Holy King as well, am I wrong?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The other two felt it was impossible, but neither of them could deny it.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIn that case, we need to start thinking about our plans from now on. While I would like Captain Custodio to be here, will she disobey a direct order?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026I feel it would be fine as long as it\u2019s in keeping with this country\u2019s justice.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI see\u2026 I\u2019ve been thinking about how to attack the prison camps. The reason for that is\u2014\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Caspond began to explain.</div><div class=\"western\">Roughly 100,000 demihumans had attacked the nation.</div><div class=\"western\">Since they had not heard of any movements from the demihumans squaring off against the forces of the Southern Holy Kingdom, they estimated that the 40,000 demihumans that had attacked them this time round were a large portion of the forces assigned to manage the prison camps in the North.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI agree with your opinion. By attacking the undermanned prison camps, we can both destroy them piecemeal and increase our own forces at the same time. I feel it will kill two birds with one stone.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cCaptain Montagnes, I am glad to hear you approve. How about yourself, Priest Naranho?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Siliaco also agreed with Caspond\u2019s suggestion.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThe Sorcerer King is in this city. Since he can keep us safe, I would like the paladins to attack the prison camps\u2026 can you do that? Also, one more thing. I would like Captain Remedios to stay here while you are launching the attack. Make her think that she\u2019s in charge of bodyguarding me.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThank you very much, my Prince!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve said anything you need to thank me for, Vice-Captain Montagnes,\u201d Caspond said as the smile faded from his face. \u201c\u2026The absence of the country\u2019s strongest paladin means that if there\u2019s someone like the Grand King at the prison camp you\u2019re attacking, you might all be wiped out, am I wrong?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cCan we decide which camp to attack?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cBut of course. I\u2019ll leave it to you. There\u2019s no need to force yourself to attack a large camp that\u2019s more dangerous.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cUnderstood. In that case, I feel only we should go.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cCaptain Montagnes, may several of our battle-capable priests go with you?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cCertainly. Then we\u2019ll set out in a couple of days\u2019 time.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\"></div><div class=\"western\">***</div><div class=\"western\"></div><div class=\"western\">Ainz used \u300cGreater Teleportation\u300d to reach his destination, which was in front of the log cabin on the surface of Nazarick. Albedo, Demiurge, and Lupusregina were all standing there already, although he did not know how long they had been waiting.</div><div class=\"western\">Albedo and Demiurge had been summoned by Ainz, while Lupusregina must have been the one on duty in the cabin.</div><div class=\"western\">Since Lupusregina was in charge of all matters concerning Carne Village, she should have been excused from the log cabin\u2019s duty roster, but that was not set in stone.</div><div class=\"western\">Perhaps someone else was on duty, but they had not been able to make it, so Lupusregina had rushed over instead. That would be wonderful it it were the case. After all, that would imply that even if there was a lack of manpower for a shift after completing a mission, there was a system to immediately swap someone else in to make up the shortfall.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Still, hang on.</i></div><div class=\"western\">While the Pleiades each had completely different job abilities, their maid skills were all equal. It only made sense that they could substitute for each other in a professional capacity.</div><div class=\"western\">However, in contrast to that, there were also personnel who were hard to replace. Starting with the Floor Guardians and the Guardian Overseer, there were some NPCs with highly specialized abilities who might need someone to take over them for one reason or another. This was especially true because Ainz had been working hard towards establishing a vacation system.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>After all, letting Pandora\u2019s Actor substitute for all of them is also dangerous.</i></div><div class=\"western\">To take an extreme case, what if Ainz himself was not around? For instance, if he were imprisoned, or if he were charmed, or something else. While he did not think that everything would break down without him there to make decisions, he had the feeling that Albedo and Demiurge would both say, \u201cAinz-sama would never let that happen to himself,\u201d and thus not plan for unforeseen circumstances.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>I need to seriously assess the need for this, and quickly.</i></div><div class=\"western\">In a grave tone, Ainz bade the three people bowing to him to raise their heads.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIt has been a while, Demiurge.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYes!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">In truth, Ainz agonized over the Holy Kingdom\u2019s affairs every day, and he also thought about Demiurge every day, so it did not actually feel that way. However, it had been quite a long time since they had last met in person.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cNow then, you probably have questions about why I acted as I did. While I would like to answer you, speaking in this place is not quite appropriate. Let us go somewhere else.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz was the first to enter the log cabin.</div><div class=\"western\">He could have come here straight away because there was a Gate Mirror set up, but he did not use it today.</div><div class=\"western\">There was a table in the center of the room, and there were two chairs facing each other on either side of it. Ainz took the seat of honor with familiarity and without hesitation. He had already experienced the problems which came of not doing so many times already. While he had once needed to ponder which was the top seat before sitting down, he had now reached the point where he could unconsciously take the seat of honor</div><div class=\"western\">As he approached the chair, Lupusregina immediately pulled it out for him.</div><div class=\"western\">In truth, he was of the opinion that he ought to pull his chair out himself. However, his observations of Jircniv had made him understand that it was very important for a ruler to let his subordinates do work. Still, letting them handle even trivial tasks like this gave Ainz the commoner a bit of difficulty.</div><div class=\"western\">After Ainz sat down, Albedo and Demiurge did not take a seat, but instead knelt on the floor. Behind them, Lupusregina went to her knees as well.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2014I permit the two of you to sit down.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The two Guardians politely refused in unison. Ainz once again granted his permission to the two Guardians, whereupon they finally sat opposite Ainz after a great deal of thanks and gratitude. Lupusregina, on the other hand, stood stock still behind the two of them.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>This takes so long and it\u2019s a waste of time. Couldn\u2019t it be simpler like\u2026 ugh.</i></div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThen let us continue our previous topic. While I said there was nobody who needed to be saved, I rescued the people of the Holy Kingdom nonetheless. I am sure you have your questions about that, do you not?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cNo, not at all.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u2014<i>Er? W-Why?</i></div><div class=\"western\">Demiurge shook his head gently, unable to resist the urge to sigh in admiration.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cEverything you do is correct, Ainz-sama. I feel that the reason why you did so was because you saw that it held merits which I could not imagine.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThat is correct. If you feel it needs to be done, then it must be correct, Ainz-sama.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u2014<i>Eh?</i></div><div class=\"western\">Albedo\u2019s words froze Ainz\u2019s facial expressions solid. But of course, Ainz had no facial expressions to speak of.</div><div class=\"western\">The way the two Guardians \u2014 who were also the most knowledgeable Guardians in Nazarick \u2014 nodded in unison before him filled him with various flavors of terror and anxiety.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWait, wait. Indeed\u2026 yes, it is true.\u201d Ainz began to panic. The conversation had travelled a path that was slightly different from what he had foreseen, and so he had become confused and could not clearly think of what he wanted to say. However\u2014 \u201c\u2014Indeed, under normal circumstances I would have acted as you had imagined.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Huh?</i> Ainz was slightly confused. He struggled to piece some words together and threw them out as appropriate. Even so, the two of them continued nodding vigorously, and Ainz found that a little odd. He continued speaking, desperately hoping for a last second save.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHowever, yes, however. This time was slightly different. I did not do this because I was planning something.\u201d Having found a way to amend his words, Ainz delightedly continued, \u201cThis time round, I was deliberately introducing a flaw into the plan.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWhat would be the reason for that, Ainz-sama?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz slowly leaned on the back of the chair with a <i>Hm.</i> Then he adopted a well-practiced posture, a grand one that was befitting of a ruler, which a master ought to have, and then spoke.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cDemiurge. Albedo. The two of you are more intelligent than me.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThat\u2014\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz held up his hand to stop the two of them from speaking.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI am just saying that this is how I feel. In that case, what would happen if something unexpected occurred during parts of the event described in your plan? If everything proceeded as you outlined, then everything would have been perfect and ended in excellent form.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\"><i>That said, your plan was really over the top,</i> Ainz grumbled in his heart. <i>I felt I was sure to fail given how you threw everything in your operation outline at me.</i></div><div class=\"western\">\u201cTherefore, a question suddenly came to mind, Demiurge. A perfect tactical mind cannot only function when everything is going on course; it must also be able to work when the situation changes dramatically or when it diverges from your expectations. That is to say, I wanted to know if your adaptability was also as laudable.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI see, so that\u2019s it!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Eh\u2014!? He already got it!? And he sounds like he understands it all too!</i></div><div class=\"western\">Ainz resisted the urge to make a jab about Demiurge\u2019s preternatural processing speed, something along the lines of, <i>You\u2019re already so smart, why do you think I\u2019m smarter? Are you bullying me!?</i></div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAs expected of, ah\u2026 you\u2019re as impressive as I expected, Demiurge.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThank you very much, Ainz-sama.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cStill, I, ah, apologize, though it feels like I was testing you\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cCertainly not, Ainz-sama. To me, the fact that you would wish to assess my abilities is an honor that knows no equal. I will assuredly return results that match your expectations, Ainz-sama!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cUmu. I\u2019ll leave that to you, Demiurge. In that case, during the course of our activities in the Holy Kingdom, I will cause problems as needed and you will amend the plan in response. Will that be alright?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYes! I understand!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\"><i>All right\u2014!</i> Ainz rejoiced within his heart. He was so happy that the emotion was suppressed.</div><div class=\"western\">Even so, excitement still remained inside him.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Good, good, good. This way, even if I screw up, I can say that I was doing it on purpose! No, of course, I need to try not to screw up in the first place. If I\u2019d known, I should have said this from the start.</i></div><div class=\"western\">While he did not have the bad habit of gloating when a subordinate\u2019s plan went awry, it was possible that he might accidentally do something to make them worry. In this way, they would not have to guess if he had some intention in mind, but instead move on to revising the plan as needed. Ainz felt the sense of bliss which came with taking a heavy weight off his shoulders.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026Your servant understands your concerns, Ainz-sama. So does that mean that you will be simultaneously assessing the abilities of each Floor and Area Guardian as well?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">As he heard Albedo\u2019s question, Ainz was briefly puzzled for a moment and thought, <i>What\u2019s she saying?</i> However\u2014</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThere\u2019s no need to do so right now. I am doing so for Demiurge because he must work outside Nazarick for extended periods. As for the others, I will test them when it becomes necessary.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI see\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cUmu. Now, for the next topic\u2026 the initial plan was to take those people of the Holy King who were enthralled with me and proceed to the eastern part of the Holy Kingdom, to the Abelion Hills where the demihumans lived. However, I am going to amend this part of the plan. I will go there first. From there, spread the news of my death.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">It felt like time had stopped for a moment. And then\u2014</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2014Eh? What are you saying, Ainz-sama!? How could we announce the death of the Supreme One, Ainz-sama!?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">That protest came from Albedo. This might have been the first time he had seen Albedo\u2019s expression crumble in this way. At least, that was how the look on her face made him feel. But before Ainz could explain his true intentions to Albedo, it was Demiurge\u2019s turn to speak up.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAlbedo. Since Ainz-sama has stated this, he must have some wonderful aim in mind. Do you not think rejecting it on an emotional basis is inappropriate?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cDemiurge. I question where your calm comes from. Would you react in this way if Ulbert Alain Odle \u2026-sama were to say the same thing? Or\u2026?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cFufu\u2026 Albedo. Could you tell me what you mean by that? Or do you mean that you have something to say to me afterwards?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The two Guardians glared at each other, one with a freezing-cold gaze, the other with boiling-hot eyes, and a strange atmosphere began to brew between the two of them. This choking sensation was much like what had happened when Ainz had been fighting Shalltear. Perhaps it was due to fear or tension, but even Lupusregina was starting to pant heavily.</div><div class=\"western\"></div><div class=\"western\"></div><div class=\"western\"></div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2014Enough!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The dangerous mood in the air instantly vanished as Ainz shouted. The sudden change made Ainz wonder if he had been mistaken about what had happened just now. However, Lupusregina\u2019s labored breathing proved that it had not been an illusion.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cCalm down, both of you. This is the reason why I must fake my death. There are activities called disaster drills. We must mentally prepare ourselves and plan ahead of time in case of an emergency. In that case, what would you do if I died? I\u2019ll start with you, Albedo. Tell me what you have in mind.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYes! I would immediately subject the person who dared disrespect you to all the suffering in this world, and resurrect you, Ainz-sama!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI see. Your turn, Demiurge.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYes! While preparing for your resurrection, I would strengthen Nazarick\u2019s defenses and then obtain information on the person who offended you.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Albedo glared at Demiurge out of the corner of her eye.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cMerely gathering information on them is too lenient. Regardless of who dares offend the Supreme One, they must be captured with all the strength Nazarick can bring to bear and then tormented to the point where their ego breaks down.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAlbedo, I feel what you say is very sensible. However, the enemy is someone who can kill Ainz-sama. Thus, we cannot be careless. Learning the enemy\u2019s movements and strengths is vital. If the enemy is stronger than we can imagine, then the place in which we resurrect Ainz-sama will become very important.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Before Albedo\u2019s expression could turn even more grim, Ainz rapped his staff on the floorboards. The hard impact was like splashing a bucket of ice water on the two of them, and their faces immediately regained their calm.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI did not specify that I was killed by someone. If things go badly\u2026 it is not impossible that I might end up dying naturally from some unforeseen circumstances.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">In truth, he could not think of any natural cause from which he could die, which was why he was using such vague terms.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHowever, it would seem that even the two people that I consider the most intelligent of all have differing opinions. That distresses me. That is why we must undertake this training, so that there will be no problems if this imagined scenario comes to pass.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The two of them bowed their heads.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cOf course, I am not the only one who could suffer that fate. Demiurge, as Nazarick\u2019s defensive commander during a time of attack, if an unexpected situation occurs and you are struck down, could Nazarick continue functioning normally?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYes! I have made thorough preparations in that respect. I recall submitting a report on that to you in the past, Ainz-sama.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Eh, did I receive something like that?</i> Ainz decided that it would be better to trust Demiurge\u2019s memory than his own.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cUmu. Still, that is only on paper, is it not? The reason I am asking is because I would like to know if you have tested to see if it truly works out.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI sincerely apologize! I have not done so!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Demiurge bowed his head, his face a mask of deepest regret as his voice trembled.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cMy, my deepest apologies, Ainz-sama! Signing off on the document without making that suggestion was foolishness on my part!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Albedo had the same look on her face as Demiurge as she bowed her head.</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz was filled with a tremendous sense of guilt. Whose fault was it? The answer was that it was his own. If he had been more reliable, the two of them would not need to apologize like this. Was he not a scummy boss?</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2014There is no need for you two to apologize. It was my fault for not properly explaining matters to you. I was the one who should have noticed that no test had occurred. The mistake is mine.\u201d Ainz bowed his head until his forehead touched the desk. \u201cAll this was due to my unworthiness, and I seek everyone\u2019s forgiveness.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWhat!? Ainz-sama!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cPlease, please do not do that!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The two of them hurriedly tried to stop Ainz. However, Ainz did not raise his head. He was too ashamed to show them his face, because he knew that he was so shallow that he could not even come clean when apologizing.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cLu-Lupusregina! Hurry and raise Ainz\u2019s head!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cEh! Me? Please, please forgive me, I can\u2019t possibly raise Ainz-sama\u2019s head by force!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cPlease, please raise your head!\u201d they all said in unison.</div><div class=\"western\">It was only after the three of them \u2014 Demiurge in particular \u2014 started looking especially flustered that Ainz hurriedly looked up. After that, he heard sighs of relief from the three of them.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026I am grateful that you have accepted my apology. Now then, when I reach the Abelion Hills, we will use my death as the basis for an exercise. Yes. Since this is a rare opportunity, why don\u2019t we conduct other exercises as well? For instance, if Demiurge and I were killed off by someone, that sort of thing\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">At this point, Ainz began to feel uneasy about his own suggestions.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThat said, even I have not fully planned out the details when it comes to this training. Therefore, if you have come up with a better plan, go ahead and carry it out. Ahh, no need to ask my permission. After all, this is an exercise founded on the premise that I am dead.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The two of them smiled bitterly.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAinz-sama, having to consider you dead from the start of the exercise\u2019s planning phase is a little\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIt is as Demiurge says, Ainz-sama.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Hahahaha, the laughter of three people rang through the cabin.</div><div class=\"western\">Two of them were laughing from the heart, but one was merely pretending.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cStill, you don\u2019t need to take it too seriously, you know? After all, the objective of this exercise is not to spread ill-will throughout Nazarick, like what happened with the two of you just now. However, I would like to conduct various kinds of training and accumulate knowledge in that field, so that every Guardian can become interchangeable \u2014 well, I know what I\u2019ve said is pointless given your respective intellects. Do what you feel needs to be done, to whatever extent you deem fit. Can I leave that to you?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Now that he thought about it, Suzuki Satoru had never been the type of person who had seriously carried out disaster drills, so was it really convincing when someone like that told others to do their best? That was why he could not forget to tell them to take it easy.</div><div class=\"western\">After seeing the two of them bow deeply to him, Ainz said, \u201cNow then, while this is a different matter\u2014\u201d</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Let\u2019s go, me!</i></div><div class=\"western\">The reason why he had drawn up all these flowcharts and simulated ways of talking down the two Guardians was for this aim.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2014You are to freeze all progress on the giant statue of me that is currently in planning.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI understand. We will do as you direct.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Albedo\u2019s single sentence seemed to put an end to the entire topic.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Huh?</i> Ainz\u2019s attitude turned from baffled to fearful as he nervously asked what was on his mind.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026Is that alright? It was your idea, was it not, Albedo?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHow could anyone contradict a decision that the Supreme Being has made, Ainz-sama? If you say it is white, then it will be white even though it is black. That is all.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz gulped. That line of thought frightened him, and he trembled.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026I do not like that way of thinking, Albedo. That is just like abandoning all thought, and even I will most certainly make mistakes at some point.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">He was just saying \u201cmost certainly,\u201d but it felt like it had been happening all the time.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAnd in that case, won\u2019t everything be over if I\u2019m captured? The person who brainwashed Shalltear is still out there, you know? While there is no need to question each and every one of my aims, if I suggest something and you think of something, you ought to bring it up.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI understand.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Albedo and Demiurge glanced briefly at each other through narrowed eyes.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThen, may I ask why you wish to cease construction? Is the aim of that statue not to let the world better understand your glory, Ainz-sama?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cUmu,\u201d Ainz laughed coldly in his heart. \u201cMy greatness is not something that can only be expressed through material objects.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">He recalled that this line had received approval from Neia.</div><div class=\"western\">\u2014<i>It\u2019s perfect.</i></div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWould it not be better to teach them with material objects? After all, fools are those who can only understand what they see before their eyes.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Albedo\u2019s words froze Ainz in place. It was just like a pitcher throwing a ball at a batter, but instead of having it being hit back at him the batter caught it instead and threw it back at full force.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026I see. You have a point, Albedo, but\u2014\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">As Ainz thanked his voice for not trembling, he struggled to work his brain, and then gave up when nothing came to mind. While he nearly rounded his shoulders, he could not allow his image as a ruler to crumble before his subordinates.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2014No, forget it. I\u2019m sure that Albedo can pick out at least five of the flaws I\u2019ve spotted, and the merits outweigh them. In that case, there is nothing else for me to say.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cFive, five flaws? \u2026Demiurge, I need to discuss something with you later. May I borrow your intellect for a while?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cBut, but of course. I, I expected nothing less of you, Ainz-sama, to think you would say our minds were superior\u2026 truly, you are too humble.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The two of them began to get flustered, and Albedo bowed her head deeply.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI, I am truly sorry, Ainz-sama. While my plan to build your statue has already received your approval, please allow me to temporarily suspend construction. I sincerely apologize.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHm, mm. Well, it can\u2019t be helped then. Proceed, Albedo.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz had merely tossed out an offhand remark, but Albedo and Demiurge seemed abnormally shaken by it. He could even hear Lupusregina whisper \u201camazing\u201d from behind them.</div><div class=\"western\">He looked away, feeling guilty because he had once again confused the two of them by talking nonsense. However, he was glad that the plan to build the giant statue would be briefly halted.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Next, I need to do something about the four festivals with my name on it, like the Sorcerer King Grand Thanksgiving, the Sorcerer King\u2019s Birthday and so on! If the Sorcerer King Grand Thanksgiving is cancelled because the statue\u2019s been cancelled as well, that just leaves three of them! Besides, if these were normal festivals, I wouldn\u2019t want to stop them either!</i></div><div class=\"western\">In truth, Ainz had once nonchalantly suggested a plan for organizing festivals. However, that had led to the formation of a strange and embarrassing festival committee. Ainz sighed long and loud in his heart, and then looked at Demiurge.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAlright, that leaves the details which I need to discuss with Demiurge. After this, you\u2019ll have the demon you summoned, that is to say, Jaldabaoth, attack that city, right?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYes. Indeed, that is so.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cTherefore\u2026 I have a couple of requests. The first concerns a personal project I am carrying out which is not going too well, for which I will need your help. Ah, don\u2019t worry, there\u2019s no need to get too flashy with it. And the second thing is, can you command that summoned demon to fight in earnest with me?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\"></div><div class=\"western\">***</div><div class=\"western\"></div><div class=\"western\">Neia quietly closed the door to the Sorcerer King\u2019s room and turned on her heel. And then\u2026 her body quivered.</div><div class=\"western\">She lightly patted her somewhat scalding cheeks to force her face to tighten up before she completely lost her composure. One reason for that was because she knew how her relaxed face made others wary, while the other, more important reason was because it deeply embarrassed her.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia did not want to walk around outside with an unseemly look on her face. She would have to meet others later, so at the very least she had to look presentable.</div><div class=\"western\">More to the point, Neia was the squire of the Sorcerer King, so anything disgraceful that she did would also damage the Sorcerer King\u2019s reputation.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Still, I\u2019m only acting as his temporary squire, so it\u2019s the Holy Kingdom which would be disgraced\u2026</i></div><div class=\"western\">However, the people who hated the Sorcerer King would not think that way. As the saying went, one was blinded by one\u2019s hate. Or rather, it was like how those who hated swords hated swordsmiths as well.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Alright!</i></div><div class=\"western\">Neia did not want the Sorcerer King to regret the fact that she was his squire. In other words, all Neia had to do was her job.</div><div class=\"western\">As Neia headed for the place where she had arranged to meet, she thought incessantly about the kindness that the Sorcerer King had shown just now.</div><div class=\"western\">\u2014<i>Is that so, is that how it is, what a shame.</i></div><div class=\"western\">She had sensed deep regret from the Sorcerer King when he said those words back then. There was no way he could have been rattling them off casually.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>\u2026His Majesty really is a kind person\u2026</i></div><div class=\"western\">The Sorcerer King had grieved for someone from another country who had died in battle as though she had been one of his own people. Where in the world could you find a king like that? Of course, Neia did not know any other kings, so perhaps that simply reflected her dreams.</div><div class=\"western\">For instance, if Neia and the others had held on a little longer, they would have been saved along with Neia, and that father who had lost his child would also have survived.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia was not unhappy that the Sorcerer King had been late in his rescue. In the first place, she was grateful for the fact that he had come to rescue her, because he had already said that he had to conserve his mana for the battle with Jaldabaoth. In addition, she had heard some of the militiamen in Remedios\u2019s unit say that he had fought several powerful demihumans at the west gate before he had come to rescue Neia.</div><div class=\"western\">The Sorcerer King had fought two demihumans who could each kill a paladin in a single attack and another one whose strength was on par with that of the Holy Kingdom\u2019s strongest paladin.</div><div class=\"western\">The militiamen telling Neia all this had been hard-pressed to hide their excitement as they rattled the proceedings off like a machine gun, and they added, \u201cWe\u2019d all have been killed if not for the Sorcerer King.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Indeed. Neia felt a surge of heat in her chest.</div><div class=\"western\">The Sorcerer King had gone elsewhere to help others before coming to save Neia.</div><div class=\"western\">While she was slightly disappointed that the Sorcerer King had not prioritized helping her, it was wrong to feel that way. The defense of the city wall was important, but it would be a far worse matter if the city gate were to fall. If the gate had been breached and the demihumans managed to get into the city, there would have been merciless slaughters everywhere.</div><div class=\"western\">Anyone with any sense would have prioritized the city gate to save more lives.</div><div class=\"western\">People who acted according to logic were more reliable than people who were ruled by their emotions.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>That\u2019s the Sorcerer King for you!</i></div><div class=\"western\">Neia thought of the strongest paladin in her country.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Just comparing the two of them is disrespecting His Majesty!</i></div><div class=\"western\">After that, the Sorcerer King had also hunted down the few demihumans who had made it into the city, and many people had been saved as a result. In fact\u2014</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cOhhh! If it isn\u2019t His Majesty\u2019s squire-sama! Did you tell him for us?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">It would seem that Neia had reached her meeting point while she was pondering how cool the Sorcerer King had been.</div><div class=\"western\">In a certain sector of the city, six men gathered on a street which still smelled of the battlefield.</div><div class=\"western\">They addressed Neia like they had been waiting impatiently for her. In fact, they had actually been quite impatient.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYes, I\u2019ve relayed your gratitude to His Majesty.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Several people unconsciously went on the defensive as Neia looked at them, but after hearing her words, they smiled and thanked her.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAh, thank you very much. It\u2019s hard to express your gratitude to the king of another nation. No, it\u2019s hard enough just to thank the Holy Queen-sama.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThat\u2019s true, you can\u2019t even meet her to begin with.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The people before her had ages which ranged from fourteen to forty. However, all of them were squad leaders. Some of them had even been professional soldiers once.</div><div class=\"western\">Judging by their attitude, they did not feel any sense of dread toward the Sorcerer King because he was undead.</div><div class=\"western\">It was true that some people were still wary of the Sorcerer King because of his undead nature. In addition, people like that were more common among the smallfolk than the priests or paladins. They often said that the Sorcerer King was being kind in order to betray them at the right moment, and other such things.</div><div class=\"western\">However, Neia felt that their reaction was because they did not understand the Sorcerer King and had simply acted out of the usual disdain for the undead. The reason for that was the group of people before her. There were many people who had changed their way of thinking once they got to know the Sorcerer King.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cNo, please don\u2019t worry about it. I simply conveyed your gratitude to His Majesty. Ah, yes, His Majesty said that your thanks made him very happy.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">There were bashful looks on the representatives from the militiamen.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cNo, we\u2019re the ones who should be happy\u2026 oh, what should we do\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThat\u2019s right, His Majesty really is compassionate. I\u2019m embarrassed by how we used to fear him because he was undead.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHis Majesty is truly a kind person. However, I hope you will not expect such good fortune to happen again and again. After all, His Majesty did say that he had used a great deal of mana in this battle, and he would not be able to help you again next time.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The group\u2019s faces immediately sobered up.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cSo we might not have His Majesty\u2019s help next time\u2026 this is bad.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cA lot of people will be afraid if they know they can\u2019t rely on His Majesty to help them, my team especially.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIt\u2019s not just your guys. It\u2019s the same on my side too\u2026 we can\u2019t tell them about this.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Neia quietly addressed the shaken group.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cEveryone, I have come to understand one thing. That is: weakness itself is a sin.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">As puzzled looks appeared on their faces, Neia slowly explained herself.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cDo you get it? If we were strong enough, things would not have gotten to where they are now. We could have saved our parents, our children, our wives, our friends, we could have saved all of them with our own hands. The Sorcerer King once said that we are the ones who place the most value on the things which are important to us. After all, His Majesty is not the king of this country, and he simply came to assist us for a special reason.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Neia took a breath.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia raised her voice, so the people watching her and the people of the Holy Kingdom passing by would hear her words.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026When the Sorcerer King defeats Jaldabaoth and returns to his own country, what will we do when the demihumans attack again? Will we cry and beg the Sorcerer King, the king of another country, for help once more? For all we know, the Sorcerer King might not help us next time. That\u2019s because this time was an exception. Have you ever heard of a country\u2019s king working so hard for another nation?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Nobody answered Neia, because such a thing was nowhere to be found.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cMaybe you don\u2019t feel happy that a girl like me is telling you this. But who can protect the things that are important to you other than yourselves? That\u2019s why I want to become stronger. When I become stronger, I can protect myself and I won\u2019t need to borrow the Sorcerer King\u2019s strength.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYes, you\u2019re right. Exactly. I\u2019ll train myself too.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAh, me too. Next time, I\u2019ll be the one to protect my wife and kids.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll do that too. I didn\u2019t want to when I was first conscripted\u2026 but now I feel glad that I was drafted.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cStill, the Sorcerer King does make a lot of sense. Valuing the things important to us\u2026 mm, when you think about it, that really is true.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cSo if someone else values my wife the most highly, I have to kill him, then?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026I, I don\u2019t think so, right? I don\u2019t think the Sorcerer King was talking about something like that, right?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026Hey, I\u2019m just kidding, you know?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIt didn\u2019t sound like a joke\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">As the crowd laughed, Neia made a suggestion.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cEveryone, would you like to train with me? While I can\u2019t teach you all swordsmanship, I know a thing or two about archery.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Weakness was a sin. That was because the weak only created problems for the Sorcerer King, who was justice. In that case, all they had to do was become strong. She could not allow herself to cause trouble for the Sorcerer King next time. She had to allow His Majesty to focus on fighting Jaldabaoth. That was what she ought to do, as a squire.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAh, that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWe need to become strong. I\u2019ll protect them next time.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2014Why are you all gathering here? Are you discussing something?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAh \u2014 Captain.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">After being questioned out of nowhere, Neia looked back and saw Remedios Custodio standing behind her. In fact, Neia had heard footsteps approaching, but she had not thought that it would be Remedios.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Here comes trouble,</i> Neia thought as she tried to keep her face from revealing how she felt. The representatives, on the other hand, were visibly uncomfortable.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cCan you answer my question?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYes, ma\u2019am! I was telling these gentlemen that I had conveyed their gratitude to His Majesty.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cTo him, you say?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026It is hardly appropriate to address the king of another nation as \u2018him.\u2019\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios glared at Neia.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThe strong protecting the weak is common sense, is it not?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026I do not know if it is common sense, but I feel that only the strong are qualified to say such things, and not the weak.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWhat!? Are you saying that I\u2019m weak?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYes,\u201d Neia replied without any delay. \u201cCompared to His Majesty, you <i>are</i> weak\u2026 Captain, have I said something wrong?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios glared at Neia, and Neia stared back forcefully at Remedios.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHmph, it doesn\u2019t matter if you want to be friends with the Sorcerer King, but he\u2019s undead, you know that, right? A monster who inhabits a different world from the living.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYes, I know that.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI said that because I was worried about you. It seems my concern was wasted.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios looked disappointed, but it felt very fake to Neia. That was definitely not what the paladin before her really thought.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI\u2019m certain you must be busy with many things, Captain, and I would not dare take up your time. In addition, I have things to tell the others. Would it not be better for yourself to move on to the other places you have to be, Captain?</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026Very well then. You lot, it\u2019s only natural for the Sorcerer King to help you. You don\u2019t need to think too much about it, you know?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">After saying that, Remedios left. As they watched her go, someone quietly spoke up.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHow should I say this\u2026 that was amazing\u2026 is that the strongest paladin of this country\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYes, that\u2019s what she is.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">After hearing the representative speak his mind, Neia unconsciously replied to him. After that, the representatives covered their faces with their hands. It would seem they had suffered quite a shock.</div><div class=\"western\">Although Neia had not done anything wrong, she still felt a little guilty.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThe, the paladins aren\u2019t, aren\u2019t all like that. How shall I put it\u2026 she\u2019s a little special. That\u2019s\u2026 how she is. Yes.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIt must be hard for you, Squire-sama\u2026 if you can drink, I\u2019d like to buy you one.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI appreciate your intentions\u2026 uh, where was I again? Yes, training together. I can find a way to borrow a place and equipment. Can I contact you later once everything\u2019s ready?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWe\u2019ll let you handle that,\u201d \u201cAlright, we\u2019ll wait,\u201d the men cheerily answered.</div><div class=\"western\"></div><div class=\"western\"><b>Part 2</b></div><div class=\"western\"></div><div class=\"western\">Neia drew her bowstring back in one smooth motion.</div><div class=\"western\">She turned her keen gaze to the target, and she could see the silent white wisps of her exhaled breath drawn to the edges of her vision by the wind, where it disappeared. Spring was close, but it was still cold.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia buried the random notions in her mind deep within her, staring at the target in a state of no thought, and then she slowly drew herself back.</div><div class=\"western\">During the defense of the city, Neia had come to understand that nobody had time to slowly take aim on the battlefield, but right now they were training to improve their accuracy, so quick-fire drills could be left for another time.</div><div class=\"western\">And then \u2014 she released her arrow.</div><div class=\"western\">The arrow whistled as it tore through the air. It flew in a straight line and hit the target dead center.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Hoo,</i> Neia exhaled.</div><div class=\"western\">Of the ten arrows she had fired, not a single one had been off target.</div><div class=\"western\">This was an outstanding accuracy rate, but Neia took no joy in it.</div><div class=\"western\">She could not do it in the past, but right now, Neia could even split the arrow she had just launched. Of course, she would damage the arrow if she did that, so she did not.</div><div class=\"western\">The reason why she had ended up like this, why she could do something that was previously impossible for her was because after that battle, she was not just capable of archery, but of harnessing what they called divine power. However, the strange thing was that it was slightly different from the abilities that paladins were said to possess. This was because normally, paladins could only channel their powers through melee weapons, while she could imbue ranged weapons with her powers.</div><div class=\"western\">While she did not quite understand what that meant, the Sorcerer King had seemed quite interested when he had heard about this. Still, even the Sorcerer King had only said, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell from just that, let me know if other abilities awaken.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Applause rang out, and Neia smiled bitterly, because she felt uncomfortable.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWow, you\u2019re amazing, Baraja-chan.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cOh yes, it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen anyone who was so good with a bow. Nobody in my village could do that.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAhh, it\u2019s true. I used to be a hunter by trade, and I knew a few people in my own right, but none of them had Baraja-chan\u2019s skills.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The people praising Neia were the same ones sweating and training with her at the archery range. Many of their faces had not been seen on these streets during the defense of the city three weeks ago.</div><div class=\"western\">The reason for that was because people had been rescued from the nearby prison camps, and the city\u2019s population rose swiftly as a result. Those with a knack for archery or who had used bows before were drafted into archery units and placed under Neia\u2019s command.</div><div class=\"western\">Normally, people would balk at being made subordinate to a squire girl, especially if some of them were old enough to be her father. However, none of the men \u2014 and women \u2014 gathered here protested.</div><div class=\"western\">The main reason was because nobody dared voice any objections after being subjected to her vicious gaze, and also because they had to acknowledge her skill with the bow. Some of them were even more grateful to Neia after learning that she was the Sorcerer King\u2019s squire.</div><div class=\"western\">There were also some who were afraid she was undead because they had heard that she was the Sorcerer King\u2019s squire, but not everyone was like that.</div><div class=\"western\">In these three weeks, the paladins had been sent out to liberate prison camps, but at the same time, the Sorcerer King and Neia had also gone out to attack camps and rescue prisoners.</div><div class=\"western\">When the Sorcerer King had first broached the subject, there had been a shocking number of objections. However, the Sorcerer King then said, \u201cNow that the Demihuman Alliance is short on manpower, they will start to execute the captives if they judge that they lack the ability to run the prison camps, so they must be rescued without delay,\u201d and that had convinced Caspond to accept the Sorcerer King\u2019s suggestion and send the two of them out.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia had originally wanted to argue that the Sorcerer King ought to conserve his mana in order to battle Jaldabaoth. However, Neia admired how he acted to protect the people of another country and felt the justice emanating from him, so she could not bring herself to stop him.</div><div class=\"western\">And so, Neia and the Sorcerer King had freed many captives and brought them to this city. For this reason, there were people who were happy to serve under Neia.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAhhh~ I ought to learn a few things from Baraja-chan.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right. She\u2019s amazing. Also, that bow you borrowed from the Sorcerer King \u2014 the Ultimate Shootingstar Super \u2014 you can do even more amazing things with that bow, right?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThe Ultimate Shootingstar Super, huh. What an amazing bow\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">All their eyes went to the bow stowed behind Neia\u2019s back \u2014 the Ultimate Shootingstar Super.</div><div class=\"western\">She ought to have used it during her training, but she had avoided doing so because she did not want to rely too heavily on her weapon.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYes, during the battle for the city walls, it was thanks to the Ultimate Shootingstar Super that I was able to survive until His Majesty arrived\u2026 no, that\u2019s not it. It wasn\u2019t just the Ultimate Shootingstar Super, but the armor I borrowed from His Majesty and all his other items that helped me too\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Neia caressed Grand King Buser\u2019s armor.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThis armor came from a renowned demihuman, it looks amazing to me no matter how many times I look at it\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI was allowed to touch it once, its hardness is amazing. I chopped at it with a sword and it just bounced off.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cSeriously? I\u2019ve never heard that before.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">As Neia\u2019s wargear became a hot topic, she clapped to get everyone\u2019s attention.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAlright, enough chitchat, back to training. According to the Sorcerer King, Jaldabaoth\u2019s preparing to make another move soon, so we can\u2019t waste a single moment.</div><div class=\"western\">There was a chorus of acknowledgements.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAlright, it\u2019s time to begin practical shooting. Let\u2019s start, everyone.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">As she watched her subordinates \u2014 the word made her feel like a big shot, and it embarrassed her a little \u2014 disperse, Neia removed the item which covered half her face. It was an item she had borrowed from the Sorcerer King.</div><div class=\"western\">This magic item was a visor-shaped set of mirrorshades that allowed her to use a special ability known as the Serpent Shot once every three minutes. It was a technique that allowed an arrow to twist and turn in front of one\u2019s opponent, pouncing them like an animal bringing down its prey.</div><div class=\"western\">She was not too sure what it did because she had not fired it at anyone, but in all likelihood, one would need to be very agile to avoid it.</div><div class=\"western\">It was a very handy item for someone like Neia, who used the bow as her main weapon, but more importantly, the fact that it hid her eyes was amazing. Or rather, without that item, she could not have gotten along so well with the others.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia put her visor on once more, and took up her bow again.</div><div class=\"western\">Everyone here was experienced, and now that time was tight, she did not need to instruct them on the finer points of finger positioning. She had touched briefly on how to fire quickly, and after that all that was needed was to give them individual coaching and have them practice until their fingers ached. The most important thing for them was to accumulate shooting experience.</div><div class=\"western\">As usual, Neia wondered about requesting healing magic from the priests as she loosed an arrow.</div><div class=\"western\">Just at that moment, Neia\u2019s keen ears picked up a noise.</div><div class=\"western\">It had come from the outside. While Neia\u2019s shooting form nearly broke down, she managed to keep it together. It might not have been what she expected, and even if it was the person she had hoped to meet, they might have only been passing by, and not intended to come here.</div><div class=\"western\">However, the being that appeared at the door to the training yard was the great king with the skeletal face \u2014 the Sorcerer King.</div><div class=\"western\">In the beginning, everyone had feared the undead, but many of them had been rescued by the Sorcerer King during the defense of the city and from the prison camps. The clamor of respectful and thankful voices soon came to herald the arrival of the Sorcerer King.</div><div class=\"western\">However, nobody stopped practicing. Normally, they would have knelt before the Sorcerer King when he appeared, but the Sorcerer King himself had put a stop to it.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>This isn\u2019t a public place, so you don\u2019t need to do that when I\u2019m just looking in on you, am I wrong?</i></div><div class=\"western\">No king, especially one who was a nation-saving hero, should have been treated that way.</div><div class=\"western\">Even so, the Sorcerer King had said that they did not need to do so.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>What an amazing person he is\u2026</i></div><div class=\"western\">After sighing in awe, Neia went to the Sorcerer King\u2019s side, and tightly shut her open mouth.</div><div class=\"western\">She kept her visor on.</div><div class=\"western\">The Sorcerer King had said that she she did not need to take it off, since she ought to be ready to fight at any time.</div><div class=\"western\">He was probably concerned about whether she could use a magic item like it was part of her own body and thinking that she ought to be on guard no matter what unexpected things happened. Neia was deeply impressed by the depth of the Sorcerer King\u2019s considerations.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia understood that the Sorcerer King\u2019s eyes had gone from looking into his hands to herself as she ran over. For some reason, observing the Sorcerer King\u2019s habitual movements made Neia a little happy.</div><div class=\"western\">The thought that she understood the tiny quirks of an extraordinary individual made Neia\u2019s cheeks relax.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYour Majesty! We are grateful that you have chosen to visit a place like this in person!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Neia was still the Sorcerer King\u2019s squire, even after being appointed the commander of the archery unit. That said, it was hard to say that she had done a squire\u2019s job properly when she had left his side to train others in archery, not to mention she had even made him come here instead.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia wanted to prioritize her work as the Sorcerer King\u2019s squire, but instead she had chosen to do this, because she no longer wanted to be a burden to him. And there was also another reason, which she had not told anyone else.</div><div class=\"western\">That was because the Sorcerer King refused to have anyone except Neia serve as his follower. He had said that to Caspond\u2019s face with Neia in attendance.</div><div class=\"western\">The number of people here was steadily increasing. There were many more skilful or charming people than this mad-eyed maiden. Even so, he had said that Neia would be fine. The person she viewed as justice had said that about her.</div><div class=\"western\">Could anything have made her happier?</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2014Umu. While I know you\u2019re being humble, I don\u2019t think this is a mere \u2018place like this.\u2019 After all, it is where you sharpen your fangs, is it not?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cTh-Thank you very much, Your Majesty!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">She looked around \u2014 perhaps it would be disrespectful to look away from the Sorcerer King, but the visor she wore made it possible \u2014 and saw that her people had heard it and the tips of their ears were turning red. The problem was that their performance deteriorated, possibly because they were nervous, or because they had stiffened up their shoulders in order to look good for the Sorcerer King.</div><div class=\"western\">That said, her own ears felt a little hot too.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026Miss Baraja. Your men have made a great deal of progress since last time. Surely that must be due to your hard work as their leader.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">His pleasantries both embarrassed Neia and left her at a loss for how to answer.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>It would be embarrassing to say that they got nervous and can\u2019t show their full ability because Your Majesty arrived. They would think so too.</i></div><div class=\"western\">Therefore, Neia decided to take his words as they were given. However\u2014</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing of the sort. I hardly taught them anything. They could have done that by themselves.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIs that so? Well, if you say so, then it must be true.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">In other words \u2014 the Sorcerer King did not think so. Which meant that the Sorcerer King thought very highly of Neia.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia raised her voice a little to try and hide her desire to skip in delight.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIn, in that case, Your Majesty, does your presence here mean that the meetings are over?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAh, yes. They\u2019re done for the day, but that said, I did not make any special suggestions.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Right now, this city had a mountain of problems, all of which stemmed from the increasing population. The small city of Lloyds had originally been home to less than 20,000 people, but after gathering the people from the liberated camps, there were more than 150,000 people here now.</div><div class=\"western\">The most recent of these overpopulation problems was the slimes used in the sewers \u2014 the Sanitary Slimes \u2014 whose own population had surged due to an abundance in food and had thus caused a panic when they erupted from the waterways.</div><div class=\"western\">When the slime population grew, they were typically burned back down with magic items, but the unexpectedly rapid growth meant that this was not done in time and several men and women had been attacked.</div><div class=\"western\">When these men and women were surrounded by the slimes, a group of rubbish-clearing monsters called the Filth Eaters appeared from the sewers to help them.</div><div class=\"western\">Unlike how they appeared, the Filth Eaters were intelligent monsters, and they knew that humans could produce a great deal of their food, and so they saved the people with their acid-resistant bodies.</div><div class=\"western\">However, the people were not grateful to the Filth Eaters. That was because Sanitary Slimes were not infectious themselves, but the Filth Eaters who helped them were masses of disease. Thus, the people they had helped had fallen ill and were in a very bad state, particularly those who had contracted encephalitis.</div><div class=\"western\">In addition, it was winter now, so firewood and other fuels were scarce. Then there was the fact that there had been delays in the construction of housing. While there was no food shortage yet, that would become a danger in the future.</div><div class=\"western\">The Sorcerer King had been invited to many of the meetings to deal with these problems, possibly because they were counting on his prodigious knowledge to solve their problems.</div><div class=\"western\">While the Sorcerer King had simply said that he did not know that much and had merely sat aside to listen, such a person could not have been summoned to meetings time and time again.</div><div class=\"western\">The fact that he conducted himself so humbly despite being the king of a nation only deepened Neia\u2019s respect for him.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWhat do you intend to do next, Your Majesty?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cUmu. I had intended to see if the transportation of logs was going well\u2026 Are you busy with practice, Miss Baraja? If you don\u2019t mind, would you like to accompany me?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">In order to solve the lack of fuel and housing, they were using the Sorcerer King\u2019s undead horses to transport logs from a distant forest. Initially, many people had been averse to using undead horses for transport, but now there was a steady stream of praise for the merits of these undead horses.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cNo, please allow me to go with you! I am Your Majesty\u2019s Squire, after all!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The knowledge that she would be able to perform her squirely duties at long last and her delight at being alone with the Sorcerer King caused Neia to unconsciously speak faster and louder.</div><div class=\"western\">As a result, Neia\u2019s ears burned.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIs, is that so? Then let us proceed.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYes! Please\u2014\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Then, as though to interrupt her, a sky-scorching inferno erupted in the distance.</div><div class=\"western\">For a moment, Neia wondered what was burning.</div><div class=\"western\">But that was wrong. She had been too far off. That could not have been caused by any form of natural combustion.</div><div class=\"western\">That fire seemed to be enveloping the city. In other words, it was a wall of fire \u2015 Neia\u2019s mind immediately recalled what the members of Blue Rose had said.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2014Your Majesty! That\u2019s\u2014\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAh, it is as you are thinking, and the same as what I heard from Momon\u2026 the time has come at last. It\u2019s Jaldabaoth. He\u2019s attacking at last. Miss Baraja, I\u2019m heading out.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Had he anticipated this series of events? As though influenced by the Sorcerer King\u2019s calm attitude, Neia\u2019s heart calmed down as well. Or no, it would be better to say that the presence of a supreme being like the Sorcerer King gave her peace of mind.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWhere to!?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAh \u2015 hm. Jaldabaoth\u2019s aim is still unclear. So, ah \u2015 he might just be here to slaughter indiscriminately. However, if he has an objective, he\u2019ll either be targeting me or the Holy Kingdom\u2019s leadership, so it would be best if we met up. Tell your men to get ready for battle and then have them flee to a safe place.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cEh!?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThey\u2019ll be of no use against Jaldabaoth. In that case, it would be better to have them prepare to deal with any demons which might appear. Since the city will probably be in chaos now, once you form up your unit, won\u2019t it be better to have them head outside the city?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">While his words had been unclear at first, perhaps he had organized his thoughts later on, because the middle part onwards was a nonstop series of instructions to Neia.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYes! Thank you very much, Your Majesty! Alright, everyone!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">While they had made plans in case Jaldabaoth led an army against them, they had not expected a blaze to surround the entire city. Another big problem was the fact that they did not know the extent of the preparations that the enemy had made.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia gave her instructions. There was only a single squad here and they could not do as they pleased, but as a team leader, she had a responsibility to do several things before her orders came.</div><div class=\"western\">The instructions went roughly like this:</div><div class=\"western\">Everyone in the squad was to take their families and head to the east gate, because if the enemy attacked, it was more likely that they would attack from the west gate. After that, they would form up at the east gate, and if there were demons outside the east gate, they would climb the walls near the east gate and attack them. In addition, they were to listen to Neia\u2019s adjutant until she arrived and adapt to changes in the battlefield conditions.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia\u2019s subordinates obeyed her instructions and moved swiftly into action.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYour Majesty!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">After giving her orders, Neia turned back and saw that the Sorcerer King\u2019s eyes were on his hands, while he had used a flight spell to rise to somewhere around the level of Neia\u2019s head.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYour Majesty! Let me go with you!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Perhaps he was startled by Neia\u2019s shout, but the Sorcerer King suddenly closed his hand and a quiet sound came from within.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHmm\u2026 well, all right.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The Sorcerer King cast a flying spell on Neia as well. In that moment, she realized the greatness of magic as she learned what it was to fly.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia and the Sorcerer King moved as though they were skimming along the ground. They did not leave the surface except to soar over crowds of people, who had descended into chaos, because they could not get a grip on the situation. The reason for that was because flying in the air without cover made them very obvious, and if there were demons about, they might be subjected to attack spells from all directions.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia bit her lip in unhappiness, feeling like she was being a burden. Whatever spells the demons used, they could not possibly pose a problem for the Sorcerer King. She could not help but think that he had chosen to go the long way around instead of flying directly to his destination because she was around.</div><div class=\"western\">Eventually, they reached their destination \u2015 the headquarters, which also doubled as Caspond\u2019s chambers.</div><div class=\"western\">The two paladins at the door had their hands full trying to manage the people jammed up near the door.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cMiss Baraja, we\u2019ll go in from above.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYes!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">After seeing that it would be a little difficult to enter from the front door, the two of them floated up and arrived at the balcony. Just then, the window facing them opened up.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYour Majesty! Thank you for coming.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">It was a paladin.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAre the others here yet?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cNo, Your Majesty. The priests are assembling. Vice-Captain Montagnes is off to liberate a prison camp and isn\u2019t expected to return today. Right now, only Captain Custodio and Prince Caspond are present.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIs that so? Still, it\u2019s good that the two of them are here. Lead the way.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYes!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">After the paladin led them to Caspond\u2019s room, they could hear a loud discussion through the door. It seemed quite chaotic.</div><div class=\"western\">The paladin opened the door for them, and over a dozen pairs of bloodshot eyes greeted them.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cSorry I\u2019m late. We\u2019re out of time, so what plans were you discussing just now?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Everyone glanced at each other, and Caspond spoke up on their behalf.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWe have not spotted Jaldabaoth yet. Your Majesty, could this fire have been made by a magic item or a demon other than Jaldabaoth?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI am unsure. After all, even I could not do such a thing.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The others were shaken. The Sorcerer King employed magic that beggared the imagination. How powerful must Jaldabaoth be if he could use a spell that even the Sorcerer King could not?</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIn that case, what effects does that fire have? Blue Rose said that they managed to pass through it, then surely normal people can do so as well, right?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">After saying so, Remedios turned to look straight at the Sorcerer King.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThat won\u2019t be a problem. As for its effects, demons standing inside the fire benefit from improved attributes, negative-karma spells will do slightly more damage, item drop rates will increase, and many others. But according to the results from the investigation team, none of those were in effect. Still, whether it does anything else remains to be seen.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWhich means we can freely move in and out of it, right?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHm? Didn\u2019t I say that at the beginning?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIn that case, we ought to evacuate as long as there are no demihumans or demons around, and then form up into units there. After all, I heard that demons appeared within the area surrounded by the fire when it was last seen in the Kingdom. Let\u2019s go with that plan of action, everyone.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">After giving the paladins their orders, he asked the Sorcerer King again, \u201cCan you use your magic to pinpoint Jaldabaoth\u2019s location, Your Majesty?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIf I could, I wouldn\u2019t need to stay in this city now, would I?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYou have a point.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Just as the Sorcerer King was dealing with one question after another, everyone heard an ominous creaking.</div><div class=\"western\">It started out quietly enough, and then it steadily grew to drown out the clamor in the room. One by one, they all quieted down, and finally, the only sound in the silence was the creaking.</div><div class=\"western\">Everyone looked around uneasily. Just then, Neia noticed something odd on the outside wall of the building and exclaimed an \u201cAh\u2015\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">A crack appeared on the wall, and as everyone watched, it began to spread. The wall bulged, and then\u2014</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cGet away!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Just as Remedios shouted, the Sorcerer King stood in front of Neia.</div><div class=\"western\">The wall broke apart with a mighty crash. Bricks flew through the room like a spray of shotgun pellets. Groans filled the air; they came from those people who had been hit by the fast-moving masonry.</div><div class=\"western\">If the Sorcerer King had not shielded Neia with his body, Neia might have ended up wailing on the ground with them.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cTh-Thank you\u2015\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The Sorcerer King held up his hand to stop Neia before she could thank him, and then he pointed at the smoke-spewing gap in the wall to draw her attention there.</div><div class=\"western\">There was a gigantic silhouette there, the color of a roaring blaze.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2015Thank you for the warm welcome, humans.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">It was a deep and powerful voice.</div><div class=\"western\">As though cutting through the smoke, that being slowly leaned in through the hole in the wall and entered the room.</div><div class=\"western\">It was \u2015 a demon.</div><div class=\"western\">Due to his vast size, he had to bend down in order to barely fit inside the room. His posture looked a little stupid, but now was definitely not the time for laughter. Her throat could not work properly; she wanted to swallow the saliva pooling in her mouth, but it stuck there instead.</div><div class=\"western\">This was an overwhelming mass of power.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia had never been very good at judging the strength of her foes relative to herself, but she understood that she could not win against him even with tens of thousands of Neias. She was swallowed by a wave of power comparable to the Sorcerer King after removing his ring, and she could not move a muscle.</div><div class=\"western\">It was then that she realized who she was facing.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>That, that\u2019s Jaldabaoth\u2026 the Demon Emperor Jaldabaoth\u2026</i></div><div class=\"western\">His face was filled with wrath, his wings were red, and his burning arms \u2015 he seemed to be holding something in one hand, and Neia could not help but doubt her eyes.</div><div class=\"western\">That was \u2015 though she dared not believe it \u2015 a lower body. It emanated a vile stench, one of advanced decay.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cKyaaaaahh!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">It was a shout \u2015 no, a scream. It was a sound that only one who had burst the shackles on their emotions and fallen into madness would make. It came from behind Neia.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia\u2019s back shuddered. The person making that sound was Remedios.</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios raised her holy sword high and charged straight at Jaldabaoth, not caring about her own defense.</div><div class=\"western\">This was too rash. Even Neia, who was not skilled with swords, felt that it was a foolish charge.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2015Get lost.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Those weighty, quiet words were accompanied by the sound of splashing. At the same time, Remedios flew in a straight line and crashed into a wall. Her impact was so loud it seemed as though the entire building would collapse. After that, Remedios \u2015 who had been swatted aside like a fly \u2015 collapsed limply from the wall.</div><div class=\"western\">It would seem Jaldabaoth had sent Remedios flying with the object that looked like a human\u2019s lower body.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia would have surely died if she had taken that hit. But as expected of the country\u2019s strongest paladin, her life did not seem to be in danger.</div><div class=\"western\">In its place, a revolting odor began to spread through the air.</div><div class=\"western\">The room was filled with chunks of meat from the decayed lower body that Jaldabaoth had used to strike Remedios.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAhh\u2026 what a mess. I sincerely apologize for getting the room dirty. Of course, it would not have ended up like this if that woman had not charged at me without thinking \u2015 well, that\u2019s just an excuse. Please forgive me.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Jaldabaoth slowly bowed his head. He seemed genuinely apologetic, but that only made everyone else more afraid.</div><div class=\"western\">And then, he casually dumped what he was holding \u2015 something that looked like the charred remains of a human ankle \u2015 to the ground.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cMy my, I guess I got a little too carried away while swinging it around and the top half flew off somewhere. It\u2019s a dirty little thing, so I\u2019ve been looking for a chance to dispose of it\u2026 but in the end I managed to make good use of her. Am I not a kind demon? She must be thanking me from the afterlife.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Jaldabaoth muttered to himself.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAhhhhhhhhhh!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios touched herself as she wailed in anguish, fresh blood streaming from the corner of her mouth. No, she was collecting the chunks of meat that were stuck to her. What was she doing? <i>Has she lost her mind?</i> Neia wondered.</div><div class=\"western\">No, there was a meaning to her bizarre actions.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Don\u2019t tell me, that corpse was\u2026 how could this be\u2026</i></div><div class=\"western\">Although the lower body had tattered bits of what looked like armor stuck to it, it should have belonged to a woman. In that case, she could imagine two people that it could have been.</div><div class=\"western\">If that was really the case\u2026</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWhat a lovely sound,\u201d Jaldabaoth waved his hand like a conductor. \u201cIn that case, I believe this is the first time we have met, Sorcerer King Ainz Ooal Gown-dono \u2015 or perhaps -sama would be a better form of address?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. Now then, I trust you\u2019re here for a showdown with me?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIndeed. No amount of weaklings will make a difference.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI concur on that point. I have no intention of generating meaningless deaths.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Still sniffling, Remedios looked towards the Sorcerer King.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYour Majesty, you are strong. Stronger even than Momon. I hope you will allow me to adopt a strategy that will guarantee my victory.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Jaldabaoth raised his hand, and a head poked itself through the hole.</div><div class=\"western\">It was a woman wearing a mask and a maid\u2019s outfit. There were two of them, in fact.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI trust you will not call me despicable?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2015Uh, hm. Well, this is\u2026 mhm\u2026 uh\u2026 um.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The Sorcerer King was starting to get worried. No, that was only to be expected.</div><div class=\"western\">Nobody could have expected Jaldabaoth to arrive with his maid demons in tow. However\u2014</div><div class=\"western\"><i>That\u2019s probably not the case. The Sorcerer King is wise, and he must have anticipated this. In that case, why is he like this? Could it be that it\u2019s because we\u2019re here? Perhaps he\u2019s not confident of protecting us all as well, which is why he\u2019s worried!</i></div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYour Majesty, please do not worry about us.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cEh?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The Sorcerer King made a tiny exclamation of surprise.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia knew very well that the maid demons were beings who could kill everyone in this room, and they were so powerful that she could not be at ease even if someone told her not to worry. Compared to someone on the Sorcerer King\u2019s level, Neia and the others, probably including Remedios, were little more than valueless pawns.</div><div class=\"western\">However \u2015 she would rather die than get in his way.</div><div class=\"western\">She had once heard that the Sorcerer King\u2019s subordinates were prepared to die if they became hostages. While the Sorcerer King said it had disturbed him, Neia could finally understand how his subordinates had felt. They did not want to become a burden to the person they respected.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHahaha! Do not worry, humans. I will slowly torture you all to death afterwards. We will be waiting in the fountain at the center of town. Of course, you may flee if you wish, Sorcerer King.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI take those words and return them to you, Jaldabaoth.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The Sorcerer King and Jaldabaoth stared each other down.</div><div class=\"western\">After that, Jaldabaoth turned \u2015 and Remedios jumped up, her holy sword in hand, and rushed at him.</div><div class=\"western\">The weakly glowing holy sword looked like a band of flowing light.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cDieeeeee!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">And then, she stabbed it into Jaldabaoth\u2019s back.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWhat? This is\u2026 Are you satisfied?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u2015It was a cold, flat voice.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWhy\u2026 why\u2026 after taking a strike from the holy sword\u2026 you should be evil\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios\u2019s back looked far too tiny and insignificant in comparison.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI have no idea what to make of that. Why? What do you mean by why? It felt like a little prick. Is that enough for you? If you\u2019re done, would you mind getting out of the way? I don\u2019t intend to kill you here. That comes after I kill the Sorcerer King.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Jaldabaoth paid no heed to Remedios and spread his enormous, fiery wings. He flapped them, and Remedios collapsed to the ground.</div><div class=\"western\">Jaldabaoth ignore her as she lay on the ground and took off. The maid demons followed him.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026Then I\u2019ll be going too. You should go take shelter so you don\u2019t get caught up in the fighting. While I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be a problem, I hope you\u2019ll understand if this city ends up demolished.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYour Majesty, will you be alright?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Caspond rose from where he had dived for cover to avoid the debris flying about the room. His eyes looked at Remedios, who looked utterly defeated and could not rise to her feet.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine \u2015 I can\u2019t say that for sure, but there ought to be a chance. It would have been very troublesome if he\u2019d brought the demihumans along as shields. Looks like he\u2019s still underestimating me, and this is also a chance to bring the maid demons into my fold.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine. It\u2019s okay. My sister is still here. Kelart is still here. As long as she\u2019s around, Calca-sama might\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios smacked her face as she muttered to herself, and then she forcefully rose to her feet.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cSorcerer King! I\u2019ll go too! Lend me a weapon that can harm him! I\u2019ll become your sword for the time being!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The Sorcerer King looked at Remedios, her eyes bloodshot and filled with hate, and then shook his head.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026Forget about it. You would only get in the way.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWhat did you say!?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cDo you not understand? I speak of the disparity in strength. Or do you mean to say you understand it, but refuse to accept it? Simply put \u2015 you are a burden.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios glared at the Sorcerer King like he was her nemesis.</div><div class=\"western\">The Sorcerer King\u2019s words were very harsh, but they were also true. Or rather, they were hard to accept precisely because they were true.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cCaptain Custodio! I have another task for you. Evacuate these people outside the city!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Caspond gave the order in a stern, commanding tone.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThe original plan was to let His Majesty handle Jaldabaoth. You agreed to that too, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026Ahh, I know,\u201d Remedios bit her lip, and then she forced out her next words. \u201cYou must kill that bastard.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2015Paladins, carefully gather the remains of that body. Don\u2019t leave a single piece behind.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cCaptain\u2026 that body is\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The paladin had an idea of what was going on, and ventured his question in a trembling voice. Remedios replied in a tone that seemed to be telling him not to ask any more.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cDon\u2019t forget that there might be demonic trickery at work.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios left without looking back. Several paladins followed her, with half-frightened looks on their faces.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYour Majesty, I sincerely apologize for the way she treated you\u2026 May I apologize on her behalf?\u201d Caspond lowered his head. \u201cPlease, I beg your forgiveness.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026I accept your apology. Now then, hurry up and evacuate. If he has to wait too long, he might decide to go back on his word. I\u2019ll be heading off first to buy time, but I hope you understand that I can only give you about thirty minutes.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI understand. Everyone hear that? Get moving!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Several priests and paladins moved out with Caspond.</div><div class=\"western\">The only people left in the room were the Sorcerer King and Neia, as well as several paladins and priests who were stuffing the remains of a certain someone\u2019s body into a bag. In that case\u2014</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYour Majesty, may I come with you!?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">There were gasps of awe and sudden intakes of air from all around her. But Neia ignored those irrelevant people. She took off her visor and looked straight at the Sorcerer King.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026Umu. I cannot. He may have said all that just now, but he\u2019s a demon. If pressed, he will reveal his true nature and use you as a hostage.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cBut if that happens, Your Majesty will kill me without hesitation, will you not?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWhen you say that with such a serious look on your face, you make me sound like a cruel person. Well, if I can\u2019t save you, I\u2019ll discard you. I\u2019ll hit you with an attack spell as well.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIn that case\u2015\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2015I! I am not doing this because I want to kill hostages, you know?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAh! Forgive me\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">That was how it was. He would do it because it was the best choice available. If there were a better alternative, this merciful man would surely choose that instead. Thus, not letting Neia accompany him was because it was the best of the best alternatives.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cBut\u2026 Your Majesty, you have used many spells and even your magic items and mana in order to free this city. As a magic caster, surely you must be weakened now. Will that be alright?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cMhm! Indeed, it might be dangerous, but I came here to defeat Jaldabaoth. Fortunately, he came to find me instead. Now I\u2019ll destroy him and claim the maid demons\u2026 ugh, saying that I want the maids makes me sound like a dirty old man, hm\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Neia smiled bitterly at the Sorcerer King, who could still make a lame joke at a time like this. She wanted to speak, but the Sorcerer King cut her off with a raise of his hand.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cBesides, I\u2019ll be a laughingstock if I run away here.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The Sorcerer King shrugged, like he was kidding. Neia sensed that he was not being serious, and so she raised her voice.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYour Majesty! If they want to laugh, let them! I humbly submit that you should only fight him in top condition! Also, you came here to battle Jaldabaoth, but you ended up using a vast amount of mana and strength on the behalf of the Holy Kingdom. That\u2019s not what you agreed to in the beginning. If we say that, the people of my country will\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIndeed, that is true. But humans are creatures who only believe what they want to believe. Even if you spread the word, nobody would take it to heart, Miss Baraja.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThat\u2026! In that case, I can be a witness! And\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Neia looked out the corner of her eye at the paladins and priests listening to their conversation. Surely they would be willing to be witnesses.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026Neia Baraja. I thank you, but there is no need for that. I will not change my intention to fight Jaldabaoth.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThis \u2015 why is that?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cSimple. It is because it is a promise I have made as a king.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Neia had nothing to say. There was nothing she could say in response to that. A commoner like herself could not possibly say anything that could change the mind of a King.</div><div class=\"western\">There were murmurs of admiration around her. Indeed, this great and proud person was none other than His Majesty the Sorcerer King Ainz Ooal Gown.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia was filled with pride for the king that she held in such high esteem.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYour Majesty, I know this is deeply disrespectful, but if you feel there is danger, I beg you to flee.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Perhaps mentioning the possibility of his loss might make him unhappy, but even so she still had to say it.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026But of course. It is a fool who fights without preparing a means of escape. Even if you lose one battle, you can make good use of the information gained in the next one. It doesn\u2019t matter if you lose the first battle.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI expected nothing less of you, Your Majesty.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">An extreme interpretation of that was that if his aim was to defeat Jaldabaoth, then all he needed was to be victorious in the end. Neia was excited by this line of thinking, which was not a warrior\u2019s mindset, but that of a king.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThen I\u2019ll be heading out.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\"></div><div class=\"western\">***</div><div class=\"western\"></div><div class=\"western\">Ainz walked toward the place Jaldabaoth had indicated. Along the way, he used \u300cMessage\u300d to order the two Hanzos who had followed him to check for tails and if anyone was observing from afar.</div><div class=\"western\">After receiving a negative report on both those items, Ainz had originally intended to terminate the transmission immediately, but then he received a somewhat confused report that there were members of the Pleiades present.</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz acknowledged it and ended the \u300cMessage\u300d.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>\u2026We didn\u2019t find any other players or World Class Item holders this time round either. I keep thinking they ought to have shown themselves by now\u2026 but if they don\u2019t exist, how do you explain what happened to Shalltear? Was it some kind of coincidence? It should have been the effect of a World Class Item, right? Or was it the work of some Talent?</i></div><div class=\"western\">The fact that nothing had turned up despite going to these lengths made the whole thing feel like a trap for him. For all he knew, the opposition was waiting for him to lower his guard before striking.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Honestly\u2026 well, it doesn\u2019t matter. Careful planning for the future won\u2019t be wasted.</i></div><div class=\"western\">Therefore, Ainz contacted the other Hanzo teams with \u300cMessage\u300d to verify their readiness and that his orders had been received.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>All right, preparations are complete. The next part is simple, I just need to follow Demiurge\u2019s playbook. Even if I make a mistake, I can always say \u201cI was just testing you\u201d and so on.</i></div><div class=\"western\">That was good.</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz was moved by how light his tread was. This the first time he had felt so relaxed since coming to this world, and it was like floating through the sky.</div><div class=\"western\">Soon, Ainz came to an average-sized square.</div><div class=\"western\">This had originally been a fountain that regularly sprayed water for the citizens\u2019 leisure. However, water no longer flowed through here after the demihumans had wrecked it. There were no plans to restore it for the time being, and the surroundings looked very austere.</div><div class=\"western\">A demon stood proudly there.</div><div class=\"western\">It was a huge demon with burning wings and two crimson, brawny fists.</div><div class=\"western\">This was the Evil Lord of Wrath from Nazarick. However, what stood here was merely a monster that Demiurge had called up with his Evil Lord Summons. It could only be used once every fifty hours, but it could be freely controlled for a time. Nazarick would not be diminished even if it were killed.</div><div class=\"western\">It was level 84.</div><div class=\"western\">As a physical-attacker type Evil Lord, it had a very high HP total.</div><div class=\"western\">Of all the special abilities that Evil Lords possessed, the most dangerous one was the ability to summon another Evil Lord which was lower level than themselves. However, summoned monsters could not in turn summon more monsters. Therefore, the Evil Lord of Wrath that Demiurge had summoned could not summon another Evil Lord.</div><div class=\"western\">If this Evil Lord had been created or made, then it could summon additional creatures. For instance, the Evil Lord of Sloth would often summon pack after pack of demons and undead, making them very hard to deal with.</div><div class=\"western\">In addition, one troublesome point about the Evil Lord of Wrath was that it was very hard to manage its hate.</div><div class=\"western\">The Evil Lord of Wrath built aggro more easily than other Evil Lords. He had heard tanks say that the most aggravating thing about dealing with multiple Evil Lords at once was how to keep the Evil Lord of Wrath from going off-target.</div><div class=\"western\">In addition, it had the special ability of doing more damage and gaining more defense the higher its hate value became. Still, that was not too frightening. The only thing that Ainz had to be worried about was its ability called \u300cSoul-Bought Miracle\u300d, which produced unknown effects.</div><div class=\"western\">The Evil Lord could cast the following spells:</div><div class=\"western\">Tenth tier spells: \u300cMeteor Fall\u300d, \u300cTime Stop\u300d, \u300cField of Unclean\u300d</div><div class=\"western\">Ninth tier spells: \u300cGreater Rejection\u300d, \u300cVermillion Nova\u300d</div><div class=\"western\">Eighth tier spells: \u300cDistort Moral\u300d, \u300cInsanity\u300d, \u300cAstral Smite\u300d, \u300cWave of Pain\u300d</div><div class=\"western\">Seventh tier spells: \u300cNapalm\u300d, \u300cHellflame\u300d, \u300cGreater Word of Curse\u300d, \u300cGreater Teleportation\u300d,\u300cBlasphemy\u300d</div><div class=\"western\">Sixth tier spells: \u300cFlamewing\u300d. \u300cWall of Hell\u300d</div><div class=\"western\">Third tier spells: \u300cFireball\u300d, \u300cSlow\u300d</div><div class=\"western\">While the exact number of spells that monsters could use varied with their level and type, it was typically around 8. However, high level monsters like Dragons, Demons, and Angels were an exception.</div><div class=\"western\">Still, as a pure warrior type, the Evil Lord of Wrath\u2019s spells were not particularly fearsome.</div><div class=\"western\">It had no skills to strengthen its spells, and its magic-related stats were very low. While the Evil Lord\u2019s attack spells were of the fire element and thus targeted a weakness of the undead, there was no need for him to be wary. Its mind-affecting spells were also useless against the undead, and Ainz\u2019s karma values were negative to begin with, so spells like \u300cDistort Moral\u300d were a waste of time.</div><div class=\"western\">Since Ainz\u2019s karma value was negative, Angels were harder for him to deal with than Demons.</div><div class=\"western\">As he contemplated his opposition\u2019s data, Ainz glanced at the two maids behind the Evil Lord. He would think about them later.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cNow then, have you been told?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cBut of course, Ainz-sama.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Hearing that weighty voice made Suzuki Satoru smile unconsciously from inside Ainz\u2019s heart. That was because this demon \u2015 and all the monsters of Nazarick \u2015 were designed in accordance with their image.</div><div class=\"western\">Those voices were probably what the developers or their creators had envisioned for them. In that case, who had come up with the adorable voice that Lip Bugs had before consuming any vocal cords? Or did the whole seiyuu-in-your-mind thing that Peroroncino was talking about really exist?</div><div class=\"western\">No, that was impossible.</div><div class=\"western\">Pandora\u2019s Actor was a good example. He was a being who did not feel like he reflected what his creator had in mind. And then there was the fact that even a being without vocal cords like Ainz could speak. All he could say was that magical worlds were truly astounding.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIf you\u2019re addressing me with that name and in that tone, I take it the surroundings are clear?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIndeed.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThen I will ask you the most important question of all. Are you truly prepared to fight with the intent of killing me?\u201d\u201cYes, I was ordered to do so.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz nodded as he heard the Evil Lord\u2019s reply.</div><div class=\"western\">One thing that had made Ainz uneasy in the past was a lack of strong opponents to fight. Ever since the battle with Shalltear, Ainz had been worrying about not having chances to fight with all his strength.</div><div class=\"western\">After training and gaining experience in close combat, he could skilfully move his body as Momonga and fight as a warrior of roughly level 33.</div><div class=\"western\">However, the question of how he would fare in higher level combat still remained.</div><div class=\"western\">He should have conducted combat training against high level opponents. Unfortunately, he had not had the chance to encounter such high level monsters until now.</div><div class=\"western\">That was why he had ordered Demiurge to command the summoned Evil Lord to kill Ainz.</div><div class=\"western\">He would defeat this powerful foe who wanted to kill him, and thus strengthen himself.</div><div class=\"western\">That had been easier said than done. The two of them had been strongly opposed to the idea and persuading them had taken a lot of time. One could not fault a mentally exhausted Ainz from thinking, \u201cI thought we agreed that my word was law\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">In the end, after countless concessions and conditions, the stage had been set for this life-and-death battle.</div><div class=\"western\">A chill coursed through his body as he considered that he might die. It was a completely different sensation from what he had felt during the battle with Shalltear, because this was an unnecessary battle.</div><div class=\"western\">However\u2014</div><div class=\"western\"><i>While I had a lot of PVP experience in YGGDRASIL, I realized in the battle against Shalltear that this world is not a game. If the time comes when I must face off against a level 100 player with a great deal of real combat experience, I won\u2019t be able to win without an equivalent amount of experience. I know that cowardice leads to defeat.</i></div><div class=\"western\">Ainz was very glad that he was undead and could suppress the fear he might have felt at the prospect of death. If he were still human, he would probably have called it off by now.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cNow then, Yuri,\u201d Ainz said to the maids behind the Evil Lord. \u201cSince you and Lupusregina are here, does that mean you will be fighting me together with the Evil Lord? Are the others not here?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">He saw no sign of Solution, Entoma, or CZ. They must have been off doing work elsewhere.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWe are the only two who have come here. We sisters will challenge you together with the Evil Lord of Wrath. The reason is because Albedo-sama feels that allowing the people of this country to witness the maid demons is not a bad thing. In addition, the Evil Lord of Wrath alone might not be enough to satisfy your request, Ainz-sama.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">It was true that a single level 80ish Evil Lord would be hard-pressed to stand against Ainz. However, even the addition of Yuri and Lupusregina did not make it a very powerful opponent.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>That said, troublesome factors can become bad news. Suffering because I underestimated my opponent would be foolish. I\u2019d best stay on my guard.</i></div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIn addition, Albedo-sama ordered us to check something with you, Ainz-sama. Are you really alright with the condition that you will not leave Nazarick for the coming year if you are defeated?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAh, that was one of the conditions Albedo insisted on before agreeing to this bout. If I lose, I will spend the next year working hard within the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick, with Albedo, in the same room\u2026 aren\u2019t you going to verify the conditions that Demiurge mentioned?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz looked at the Evil Lord, but it said nothing. It probably felt that there was no need to check.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThank you very much.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Yuri bowed.</div><div class=\"western\">Now there would be no margin for him to change the plan. As he thought of how dire the situation was, Ainz could not help but sweat internally.</div><div class=\"western\">It would be easy enough to kill Yuri and the others due to the tremendous disparity in their respective strength, but Ainz Ooal Gown would never allow that. Killing an NPC for the sake of training was utterly ridiculous.</div><div class=\"western\">In other words\u2013</div><div class=\"western\"><i>I have to kill the Evil Lord without harming Yuri and Lupusregina.</i></div><div class=\"western\">Ainz could not help laughing. This would be one hell of a challenge. Still, there would make for good training.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIs something wrong, Ainz-sama?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing, don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAlso, Cocytus-sama requested that we record this battle so everyone in Nazarick can learn from it. Do you mind?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">While he did not want to do so because he felt it was embarrassing, recording battles was very common in YGGDRASIL. With that in mind, he ought to accept that request.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cStill, recording the battle proceedings will trigger interference from the anti-divination offensive barriers. Shall I lower it?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cSurely you mean divination-detecting spells, do you not, Ainz-sama? And not the linked offensive spell model?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAh, yes, that\u2019s the one. After all, if it were the latter, it would be bad if someone from Nazarick were trying to find my position and triggered it.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">If he deployed the linked offensive spell barrier, as he had used to in the past, any member of Nazarick trying to cast a divination on Ainz would be very badly hurt. While he used to cast that spell all the time because friendly fire was off, doing so now would be dangerous.</div><div class=\"western\">Of course, the denizens of Nazarick would not be hurt by the offensive barrier, given that they were protected by a World Class Item, but the defense would incur a cost in gold coins. If things went badly, expenses like that would be more painful for him.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThen there\u2019s no need to worry ~su.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cNo, I\u2019d best deactivate it. Besides, offensive barriers disappear once they activate and have to be reset. In that case, I might as well just deactivate it from the start and have some peace of mind.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI see ~su, then I\u2019ll leave it to you ~su.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz deactivated his offensive barrier.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAlright \u2015 then let\u2019s begin the combat recording. Whose point of view are you using? I don\u2019t mind if it\u2019s mine, you know?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI think I was supposed to do the recording ~su.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">In truth, Ainz was fine with anything. Anyone\u2019s perspective would have been alright.</div><div class=\"western\">In addition, the memories of sparring with his friends were coming back to him, and Ainz began to enjoy himself.</div><div class=\"western\">Simulated battles with his friends were a fundamental part of devising new techniques and using new equipment.</div><div class=\"western\">He had often sparred with Touch Me, but those battles did not count and had not been entered in Ainz\u2019s PVP record.</div><div class=\"western\">Since Ainz had never won even once, his win rate would have dropped if they had been recorded. He had never taken it seriously, simply treating it as \u201ctraining\u201d since he knew he could not win. Ainz always emphasized that.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cShall we begin, then? You need to prepare yourself to kill me. Of course, I won\u2019t kill you.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cNo, actually, it\u2019s alright if you kill us.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Before Ainz could say that he did not want to do so, Yuri stated the reason.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAinz-sama, we are not the actual members of the Pleiades. All of us are Greater Doppelgangers.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWhat!? What did you say?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWe are musicians of the Erich String Orchestra under Chacmool-sama of the Five Worsts. By Albedo-sama\u2019s order, we have transformed into members of the Pleiades.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2015Is that so?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">He looked at them several more times, but Ainz could not tell the difference between them and the Yuri and Lupusregina which he knew. He could not help but wonder if this was a lie they were telling so he could kill them without worries during the fight.</div><div class=\"western\">Perhaps one of them was fake. He had once heard that the best lies were those that had a little bit of the truth sprinkled into it.</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz could not see through the Doppelgangers\u2019 disguise. There was a spell that could dispel the Doppelgangers\u2019 shapeshifting, but using that spell would keep them from transforming again for a period of time due to the spell\u2019s effect. In that case, having them transform into the Pleiades would be meaningless. It would be a different matter if Ainz had learned lower tier spells but\u2014</div><div class=\"western\">No\u2014</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHm, it does seem like Lupusregina is speaking differently from normal. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Lupusregina\u2019s face went blank for a moment.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIs that strange, Ainz-sama?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The Greater Doppelganger pretending to be Lupusregina changed its way of speaking. That was probably its usual speech pattern.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAh, those aren\u2019t the usual expressions she uses.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cBut Lupusregina-sama always spoke like that in front of us\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">When a Doppelganger impersonated someone, it was more difficult for people closer to the target to see through their disguise. That was because they used a form of telepathy during their shapeshifting to read the surface thoughts of the people they were speaking to and those around them in order to extract information related to the target they were impersonating and then apply it to their impersonation act \u2015 at least, that was what their entry in the monster encyclopedia said.</div><div class=\"western\">According to Pandora\u2019s Actor, that ability had become real in this world.</div><div class=\"western\">However, that was simply to discern the possible reactions that the impersonated subject might have, and it did not read minds or search through memories.</div><div class=\"western\">In addition, since this ability was a form of psychic attack, it was useless on Ainz and other undead creatures. One could also simply resist it if the level difference was great enough. That was probably why it could not discern Lupusregina\u2019s possible reactions from Ainz and had given the game away.</div><div class=\"western\">Incidentally, it was more likely that Doppelgangers would out themselves when facing multiple people, because each of them would have a different impression of the target.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Umu. Why did Lupu always add a ~su at the end of her sentences in front of them? Ahh, I see, so it was to make them sound out of place. Perhaps she was trying to help me. What a cute little rascal she is\u2026</i></div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026Hm? My apologies. I have another question that is unrelated to combat. While Albedo has given you an order, who would have priority if I were to tell you to abandon that order?</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cNaturally, the words of the Supreme One would have priority, Ainz-sama. However, I must sincerely apologize that we will obey orders from our summoner, Anyami Shirabe-sama, above all else.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026Hm? Who\u2019s that?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Was there an NPC like that? As the question grew in his heart, the flames in Ainz\u2019s eyes flared as he heard Doppel-Yuri\u2019s answer.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThat would be Temperance-sama.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cEh? Temperance-san? Anyami? Ahhh\u2026 well, that does work as a physical description\u2026 but still, Anyami Shirabe?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYes. Temperance-sama once asked to be addressed that way, so Chacmool-sama instructed us to do so as well.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026After I return to Nazarick, I would like to hear all about this. Anyami Shirabe, huh.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">This was the first time he had ever heard him refer to himself that way.</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz could not help laughing as he learned that a former friend had referred to himself that way in a place where nobody else knew. This was truly a cunning trap, set to decrease his fighting spirit.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Ahh, no, no. I mustn\u2019t fall for Anyami Shirabe\u2019s trap! Fu, fufu\u2026</i></div><div class=\"western\">Though he knew it was not the right time to do so, he recalled the guild member in question.</div><div class=\"western\">How had he looked and felt when he had given that name?</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz narrowed his eyes as he reminisced about his friend from the past, and then he saw a surprised look on the face of Doppel-Yuri as it tilted its head. Ainz sensed that he had become careless and pulled himself together.</div><div class=\"western\">He could remember his old friends later. Right now, he ought to analyze the Doppelganger\u2019s words.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>After this, I\u2019d like to question all the vassals and NPCs about the sides of themselves that they\u2019ve been hiding. Fufufu \u2015 now then! Another question comes to mind\u2026</i></div><div class=\"western\">In the absence of a direct order, vassals like Doppelgangers would obey the NPC in charge of them. In that case, what would happen if a certain NPC wanted to kill Ainz and gathered many high level vassals and ordered them to attack Ainz with their strongest moves? Of course, this would happen while Ainz was unable to detect or stop them.</div><div class=\"western\">Would they carry out that order? Or would they disobey it?</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026You\u2019re also ready to come at me like you want to kill me, is that it?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYes. Those are the orders I have received, and I have determined that I also have your permission, Ainz-sama.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Doppel-Yuri\u2019s answer made Ainz wrinkle his \u2015 nonexistent \u2015 brows.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>\u2026Isn\u2019t this dangerous? It\u2019s probably best to see exactly where the boundary lies.</i></div><div class=\"western\">If even Ainz could think of this, then Albedo had most likely verified it herself, Still, he ought to make sure, just in case. He could not let a hole in security go unpatched.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026Indeed. I permit you to use your full abilities to kill me in this battle. Then swear on the name of Ainz Ooal Gown once more. Can you swear that what you said about your true identities just now was the truth?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYes. This we do swear, upon the names of all the Supreme Beings.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Yuri and Lupusregina transformed their hands into alien-looking objects.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2015Ah!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWhat? What is it, Doppel-Yuri?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAinz-sama, there is one thing I forgot. Our equipment was borrowed from the Pleiades. Therefore, can we trouble you to recover them for us if we are killed?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Doppelgangers could even copy the clothing and equipment of their targets if they wanted to. However, they could only duplicate appearances, and not the equipment\u2019s abilities. Since they would gain no benefits from the gear, when fighting a magic caster like Ainz, the difference between them would be like that between heaven and earth. Therefore, they had no choice but to borrow the real thing from the originals.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Greater Doppelgangers can imitate people of up to level 60. However, unlike the NPCs, they can only copy up to 90% of the originals\u2019 abilities. Even if they possess gear from the Pleiades, there\u2019s no need to be worried\u2026 is there? In that case, killing them would be too much of a waste. After all, they\u2019re mercenary vassals, which means summoning them cost money \u2015 as I thought, I should just leave them powerless. Do I need to put that into the rules after all?</i></div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAlright! I will add one more rule. Once you Greater Doppelgangers are near death, you are out. I will monitor your health with \u300cLife Essence\u300d. You can hide your HP totals, right?\u201d After Yuri replied in the affirmative, Ainz nodded. \u201cThen suppress that ability for a while. If I judge that you\u2019ll die after a light hit, I will call your name and rule you out. In that case, you will count as dead. Leave the battle area immediately. In addition, the same thing applies to the Evil Lord of Wrath. If I declare victory, the combat will end. Do you understand?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The Evil Lord of Wrath and the two Doppelgangers indicated that they understood.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cVery well. Then we\u2019ll start when the coin hits the ground\u2026 about twenty five minutes has passed, so I guess they won\u2019t complain even if we start.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz cast \u300cLife Essence\u300d and then took out a gold coin. Of course, this was not a YGGDRASIL gold coin, but a trading gold coin used in this world.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWill you not buff yourself?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cMaking time to buff yourself is also part of combat training.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">After replying thus to Doppel-Lupusregina, Ainz backed away from them, then flicked the coin up with his thumb so it landed between the two of them.</div><div class=\"western\">As the coin hit the ground, Ainz jumped back, then threw his hands out and shouted:</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAbsolute Immunity Barrier!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">He saw the Evil Lord and the two Doppelgangers freeze up for a moment. However, the Evil Lord and Doppel-Yuri immediately rushed in.</div><div class=\"western\">That was it. That was the right answer.</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz\u2019s previous actions were meaningless. There was no ability called Absolute Immunity Barrier in YGGDRASIL \u2015 or at least, there should not have been, as far as Ainz knew. Still, Ainz had shouted that name not simply to fake them out, but also for a different reason.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Ah\u2015 it feels like they\u2019re a little slow. Could it be that they think something was done to them and they\u2019ve become a little timid now? Well, that\u2019s what happens when you wonder if you\u2019ve fallen into the enemy\u2019s trap.</i></div><div class=\"western\">Their movements were restricted by the uneasiness that came from the fact that such a technique might actually exist in this world. One could say that this feint had succeeded because there were still unknown things out there.</div><div class=\"western\">Of course, that was not simply because of the unknown. A good example was Ainz\u2019s ability to create undead.</div><div class=\"western\">In YGGDRASIL, there was no such thing as using a corpse as a medium to ignore the duration on created undead. This aberration had only sprung up after coming to this world. One could imagine that there were many other such changes that had happened in the process of coming to this world from the game. No, only a fool would not think about such things.</div><div class=\"western\">In other words, making decisions with YGGDRASIL knowledge alone was very dangerous.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>I ought to discuss this with Albedo\u2026 and the others, Cocytus included.</i></div><div class=\"western\">Ainz cast a silent \u300cFly\u300d spell and began thinking as he retreated to the rear while keeping a fixed distance from his pursuers.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Albedo said destroying the Kingdom would take about two years of preparation. Should I collect information until then? Expanding one\u2019s nation means expanding contact with the outside\u2026 I ought to throw these questions at Albedo and Demiurge and get their opinions. Hm \u2015 illusions seem to be surprisingly powerful, it might be very bad if we don\u2019t watch out for them. It feels like you could do a lot with them if you were smart. If I meet a skilled illusionist, I should probably treat them well in order to recruit them. Fluder \u2015 whoa!</i></div><div class=\"western\">The Evil Lord had outpaced Ainz\u2019s \u300cFly\u300d spell on foot. Unfortunately, flying was not that fast.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">After taking a punch from the Evil Lord\u2019s maul-like fist, Ainz felt pain \u2015 though it was immediately suppressed. Though he had felt the same way during the fight with Shalltear, he was once again thankful for this body of his that could suppress his pain. Ainz could fight thanks to it.</div><div class=\"western\">After that, the Evil Lord pursued Ainz \u2015 who had been knocked flying \u2015 and closed the distance to him.</div><div class=\"western\">To Ainz, this was the worst possible thing they could have done.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Yuri has circled around behind me. They\u2019re using a pincer attack of two people who can do bludgeoning damage, which is my weakness. Meanwhile, Lupusregina is keeping her distance and casting spells\u2026 hm, that\u2019s a buff. Good grief, this is the best way to deal with magic casters. Is this because of the Evil Lord\u2019s combat AI? Or is it because it\u2019s choosing moves from the mind of its summoner, Demiurge? Well, that\u2019s fine.</i></div><div class=\"western\">If they would not let him keep his distance, then he would simply have to make his own space.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u300cGreater Teleportation\u300d.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">His field of vision immediately opened up, and the city spread below him. Under normal circumstances, he would not have been able to teleport to an unknown destination, but it would be alright as long as it was within line of sight. Having teleported one kilometer above the ground without any hesitation whatsoever, Ainz cast another spell.</div><div class=\"western\">It was \u300cBody of Effulgent Beryl\u300d.</div><div class=\"western\">This spell was exceptionally effective because Yuri and the Evil Lord both did bludgeoning damage.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cOf course, that\u2019s not all there is to it,\u201d Ainz muttered as he looked to the ground. \u201c\u2026If Bukubukuchagama-san or Variable Talisman-san were here, the backliners wouldn\u2019t be getting beaten up.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">When playing as a party, skilled aggro managers like tanks would not make mistakes like allowing the magic casters in the backline to be attacked.</div><div class=\"western\">During the time when they had stopped playing the game \u2015 when Ainz had gone out to earn the money for Nazarick\u2019s upkeep by himself, he had used mercenary NPCs to allow him to act with impunity. The only time he had truly fought alone was the battle with Shalltear. Perhaps that was why he could not help complaining.</div><div class=\"western\">They were quite some distance apart, so he had no idea where the Evil Lord was, but he had a rough idea of the square\u2019s location. While carpetbombing the area with attack spells was a valid tactic, that would be pointless. One could say that the objective this time round was to win in a full-powered contest with the opposition.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u300cWiden Magic Delay Teleportation\u300d!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Come to think of it, I used to get pissed off by the mercenary NPCs\u2019 poor management of aggro. That was probably the devs\u2019 way of saying \u201cplease group up with other players\u201d or something.</i></div><div class=\"western\">He then confirmed that something large was going to teleport above him, within the area of the \u300cDelay Teleportation\u300d spell \u2015 the Evil Lord. Thanks to the effect of the \u300cDelay Teleportation\u300d, it would take a while before it appeared in the real world. In other words, it meant that these two weak enemies which had lost their strongest shield were completely exposed before him.</div><div class=\"western\">In order to weaken the enemy\u2019s fighting strength, he ought to defeat the weaker two first. Ainz let gravity claim him, and then accelerated further with \u300cFly\u300d.</div><div class=\"western\">The added speed of the freefall meant that he was moving quite fast. The air struck Ainz\u2019s face and flowed past him. At the same time, Ainz opened his eyes and observed the square.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThough I think hiding in a house would have been better\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz muttered quietly and then selected Lupusregina \u2015 who was proudly standing in the middle of the square \u2015 as his target.</div><div class=\"western\">Yuri was some distance away. While she could see him, she did not look like she was prepared to intercept him. Leaving a healer alone was quite frustrating, but Yuri had made the right decision considering that she had to be wary of area-effect spells,.</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz ground to a halt as he skidded across the ground \u2015 in truth, he would not have been hurt even if he had crashed straight into it \u2015 and cast a spell.</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz chose one of the most destructive tenth tier spells in his arsenal, \u300cReality Slash\u300d. At the same time, he used a special ability to maximize the spell. While he could have tripled the spell or something similar to do a great deal of damage, it would be very dangerous while he did not know how much damage the Doppelgangers had taken. He had to avoid the possibility of killing them by accident.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u300cMaximize Magic\u2015\u300d\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">As he raised his hand, his hand was struck and damaged, and the spell fizzled. The mana spent on casting the spell was wasted.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>What? Interfering with a spell through a ranged attack? Is it some kind of special ability?</i></div><div class=\"western\">Perhaps it was because he was undead, or because he was a veteran player, but his confusion only lasted for a moment. Ainz immediately analyzed the attack he had received.</div><div class=\"western\">Neither the Evil Lord nor Yuri nor Lupusregina possessed abilities like this.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Perhaps it\u2019s the World Class Item holder who brainwashed Shalltear\u2015</i></div><div class=\"western\">And if the Hanzos missed him\u2015</div><div class=\"western\">If it was a ranged weapon user\u2015</div><div class=\"western\">If it was her, she could use a special ability to interfere with spells\u2015</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2015I fell for it!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz shouted as he found the answer.</div><div class=\"western\">Although Yuri closed in and delivered a punch, Ainz had already enhanced his defense with a spell, so he did not need to be so wary of her. After all, there was something more important than that.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>The whole thing was a trap from the start! No, Yuri \u2015 I see! \u201cHere\u201d was referring to the square! That was why the Hanzos said \u201cthe Pleiades\u201d were present! Dammit! I was wondering why they said \u201call of us\u201d when it was just the two of them!</i></div><div class=\"western\">All the points of data made a beautiful line.</div><div class=\"western\">CZ was attacking now.</div><div class=\"western\">It was not just Yuri and Lupusregina who were present. CZ was also on the battlefield. In all likelihood, Solution and Entoma were here too. All the Doppel-Pleiades were present in the city.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>No, no, I need to calm down. Doppel-CZ was just lucky. It was easy enough for me to resist that because of the level difference between us. She won\u2019t be so lucky \u2015 well, unlucky for me \u2015 next time.</i></div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u300cGreater Word of Curse\u300d!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The Evil Lord had finally caught up and cast a spell, but Ainz resisted it without any problems. It was only threatening in close combat, so all he had to do was keep his distance.</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz ignored the Evil Lord above him and ignored Yuri, who had only done minimal damage to him from the start. He lunged straight at Lupusregina.</div><div class=\"western\">In that moment\u2015</div><div class=\"western\">Countless Bullet Bugs flew over from the side. There was no doubt that it was Entoma.</div><div class=\"western\">He did not even need to use his High Tier Physical Immunity to stop it. That was because non-magical ranged attacks could not harm Ainz.</div><div class=\"western\">Perhaps if it was a weapon carried by the Pleiades, Ainz\u2019s immunity would have been defeated thanks to the massive amount of data within them. The best example of that was CZ and Yuri\u2019s attacks from just now. However, certain skills were calculated based on the user\u2019s level. Entoma was a prime example, since she possessed many of these user level-based attacks.</div><div class=\"western\">Entoma was only around level 50, so her attacks did not bother Ainz at all. In addition, if all damage from an attack was nullified, none of the rider effects would take place either.</div><div class=\"western\">Therefore, he could ignore it.</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz did not even spare Entoma a glance as he moved in to finish off the healer, but just then, Solution erupted from her ambush point in front of Lupusregina. It would have been a futile gesture if she was facing an area-effect attack, but that was the only way to protect the healer.</div><div class=\"western\">However, Solution had made a fatal mistake. Ainz was a magic caster and did not need to close to attack. All he needed to do was cast attack spells from a distance. He had to think about why she would charge out from in front of Lupusregina.</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz had only one aim.</div><div class=\"western\">He wanted to expose the enemy and reveal whatever card they had up their sleeve.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Narberal\u2019s not around?</i></div><div class=\"western\">He did not understand. She was not among the maid demons who had attacked the Royal Capital. However, one could not rule her out if all the Pleiades were present. It was possible that they were saving their ace in the hole for the last moment. Still, since he knew what kind of hand the opposition had, there was no reason to continue fighting in the middle of the enemy.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u300cGreater Teleportation\u300d.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">CZ did not interrupt his spell, and he managed to teleport under a roof within line of sight.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>I need to remember what Yuri and the others can do. Who should I kill first? \u2015Lupusregina, the healer. While I need to be very careful of CZ\u2026 I have no idea where she is\u2026 so I\u2019ll let the others go first. The Evil Lord will take the most time, so I\u2019ll save him for last.</i></div><div class=\"western\">He saw Lupusregina casting a spell on Solution. Had they not pursued Ainz because drawing out the battle was not a problem for them? No, it was because they understood that since Ainz could move at will with \u300cGreater Teleportation\u300d, they could be easily scattered and individually defeated. After all, Ainz was hoping for that too.</div><div class=\"western\">It did not matter if they saw through him.</div><div class=\"western\">All he had to do was harass them with ranged spells and then take them out one by one. While CZ the ranged combat specialist was present, she would eventually expose herself if she attacked continuously. Therefore, she would only attack at critical moments. In that case, she would not be so frightening. Or rather\u2015</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI didn\u2019t see her, so let me guess, you\u2019re standing in for Narberal.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz muttered to himself as he watched the Evil Lord land.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHaha, you\u2019ve become fat, Narberal. Shall we call you Gorillal now? And your element\u2019s changed greatly too. Well \u2015 this is interesting. If the Doppel-Pleiades are my opponents\u2015\u201d Ainz flourished his cape. Of course, there was no meaning to it; he simply wanted to show off in a kingly way. \u201cThen I ought to get a little serious.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Don\u2019t die~</i></div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u300cTwin Maximize Magic Re\u2015\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Just as Ainz was about to cast a spell at Lupusregina, another bullet hit Ainz\u2019s arm and interrupted his spell.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2015Hah?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Impossible.</div><div class=\"western\">Even if she had succeeded once by luck, she could not have interrupted his spell twice in a row. CZ was far lower level than Ainz.</div><div class=\"western\">Could he have been unlucky enough to fail his resistance check twice in a row? How unlikely were those odds? Or perhaps this was not bad luck, but certainty \u2015 for instance, if his opponent was not CZ at all?</div><div class=\"western\">The Evil Lord of Wrath spread his fiery wings and closed in on Ainz. Yuri came in from the right, and Entoma flew in from the left in a roundabout fashion.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>What\u2019s going on? Why is this happening? Is this some change that occurred after coming to this world? Or did Garnet-san give CZ something? Or is it not CZ? What did Yuri say just now? They\u2019re sisters, but they\u2019re Doppel\u2026 Pando \u2015 ahhhh!</i></div><div class=\"western\">The Evil Lord had closed the distance and then cocked his hand back, preparing to deliver a haymaker.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Dammit! I hate people like that who just rush straight in and start punching! If you\u2019re a substitute for Narberal than attack with magic! You damn Gorilla!</i></div><div class=\"western\">Well, if the Evil Lord had really cast a spell on Ainz, he would have resisted it, so it would have been boring anyway.</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz did not hesitate; he stepped in before his enemy could fully close the distance.</div><div class=\"western\">The Evil Lord had guessed that Ainz would flee, so his movements slowed by a beat. Behind him was Yuri, who was probably planning to flank Ainz with the Evil Lord.</div><div class=\"western\">The strike from the flaming fist \u2015 was a feint, which was why Ainz had managed to evade it by stepping into the range of the blow.</div><div class=\"western\">The arms whistled past his ears, and the wind in its wake sounded like a scream.</div><div class=\"western\">A pure magic caster had evaded the attack of a warrior-type monster.</div><div class=\"western\">While he thought that this would be impossible if he were still a YGGDRASIL player, this was not due to luck. As mentioned before, the Evil Lord had not expected Ainz to step into the attack, so he had not used his full force. And then there was another point, which was that this was the result of his training.</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz had practiced this method of evading his opponent by closing in with them several hundred times with Cocytus. About one in every ten times, if Cocytus was not attacking in earnest, he could completely slip past them.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Cocytus did say that a good warrior would never make such incredibly flashy and telegraphed attacks, so I shouldn\u2019t get careless\u2026 but it\u2019s pretty useful in an actual fight, isn\u2019t it?</i></div><div class=\"western\">And so, Ainz placed his bony hand on the Evil Lord\u2019s sturdy chest.</div><div class=\"western\">And then he cast a touch spell.</div><div class=\"western\">While most spells had an effective range, some spells had a range that was practically zero. Such spells needed direct contact with the target to be cast, so only people with levels in spellcaster and warrior classes could use them well. It was because they were so inconvenient that they were more powerful than spells of a similar tier, being roughly a tier more effective,</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz\u2019s specialty was necromancy, and this was an 8th tier spell from that field, \u300cEnergy Drain\u300d. It was a spell that drained the opponent\u2019s levels and granted various benefits depending on the amount of levels drained. Naturally, this spell had also been maximized.</div><div class=\"western\">He beat the Evil Lord\u2019s spell resistance and drained his levels. Thanks to that, he recovered almost all the damage Yuri had inflicted. That said, the healing provided by this spell was only supplementary in nature.</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz\u2019s parameters were all temporarily enhanced, and he received a special buff which would fade in a short time. In turn, the Evil Lord had received a level down debuff which could not be removed by the passage of time.</div><div class=\"western\">This time, it was the Evil Lord who backed away.</div><div class=\"western\">His wrathful visage was tinted by something else.</div><div class=\"western\">Was it surprise, or was it admiration?</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz wanted to praise himself for successfully evading that blow too. That said, he had managed it because his opposition had been far too cocky. Just like how a magic trick became boring once you pointed out the gimmick, this move would probably not work a second time.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWell, however good a plan is, only an idiot would use it more than once. Isn\u2019t that right \u2015 Pleiades! Aureole Omega!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\"></div><div class=\"western\">That was how it was.</div><div class=\"western\">He was fighting five Doppelgangers, the Evil Lord of Wrath and a level 100 NPC.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Is Albedo trying to make me lose? I didn\u2019t think she\u2019d even use Aureole.</i></div><div class=\"western\">Aureole Omega was the lastborn of the Pleiades Seven Sisters. She was an Area Guardian of the 8th Floor and a level 100 NPC specialized in commander-type classes. As a commander, she could issue orders which buffed her allies. CZ must have been able to beat their level difference thanks to that.</div><div class=\"western\">While he had no idea what kind of special ability Aureole had used, if one looked at party roles such as physical attacker, magical attacker, healer and so on, then she would be a wild card \u2015 an all-rounder. It was hardly strange that she would be able to do anything.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>What exactly could Punitto Moe-san do?</i></div><div class=\"western\">Ainz never went head-to-head with his opponents during PVP so Ainz had little experience in dealing with commander-type opponents.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>She could not have left the 8th Floor and come here without my permission. That would mean that she must have buffed the Doppelgangers before they came here. That would mean she probably didn\u2019t buff them too carefully \u2014 or no, is there a Doppelganger of Aureole here?</i></div><div class=\"western\">\u2015No. There was no time to think about such pointless things. Only one thing mattered. Could they completely shut down Ainz\u2019s spellcasting, and could they keep it up forever?</div><div class=\"western\">There were two kinds of special abilities in YGGDRASIL. One kind had a cooldown period after use. The other had a limited period of uses within a certain period. There were also combinations of the two.</div><div class=\"western\">In general, the more powerful the ability, the longer the cooldown or the fewer times it could be used. Ainz\u2019s trump card \u2015 \u300cThe Goal Of All Life Is Death\u300d \u2015 which could only be used once every 100 hours was just such an ability.</div><div class=\"western\">In that case, which type did CZ\u2019s ability to interrupt Ainz\u2019s spellcasting belong to?</div><div class=\"western\">That move just now was very handy, but it did not seem to have a long cooldown time. That would mean it was the use-limited type. However, he could not tell how long it would take for her to recover her uses. All he could do was hope that she could not recover them during the course of the battle after they were depleted.</div><div class=\"western\">\u2015<i>Though I think I ought to save my tenth tier spells for when they\u2019ve been depleted\u2026</i></div><div class=\"western\">Ainz quickly verified the positions of the Pleiades and the Evil Lord. The Evil Lord was in front of him. Yuri was behind him \u2015 and preparing to slug Ainz. While her ki-enhanced attacks could even shatter steel, they were of little concern in the face of Ainz\u2019s levels. After reconfirming that the Evil Lord was the real danger, he turned his attention to the others.</div><div class=\"western\">Entoma was inside a house on the left side of the square. Lupusregina was in the square. Solution stood in front of her, like she was protecting her. CZ\u2019s location was unknown.</div><div class=\"western\">While not knowing a sniper\u2019s position was the worst possible scenario, the fact that the enemy was now dispersed was the best case for him.</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz snorted.</div><div class=\"western\">Though he knew that now was hardly a time to laugh, he could not resist the mirth welling up inside him.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Now this is interesting!</i></div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAlright, now get out of my face. \u300cMaximize Magic Nuclear Blast\u300d!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Before Ainz\u2019s eyes, the space between him and the Evil Lord flashed and swelled, consuming everything in an instant. Yuri was surprised, but that was only to be expected, because Ainz had been caught in it as well.</div><div class=\"western\">Using the ninth tier spell \u300cNuclear Blast\u300d as an attack was a questionable choice. It did composite damage \u2015 half fire, half bludgeoning \u2015 and it was one of the weaker 9th tier spells in terms of damage.</div><div class=\"western\">Considering the Evil Lord of Wrath was immune to fire, this spell should not have even been considered for use. Even so, Ainz had his reasons for using this spell.</div><div class=\"western\">First of all, it had a very large area of effect. It was superior to almost all other spells in that respect. In addition, this spell also generated all kinds of negative status effects such as poisoning, blindness, deafness, and so on, but anything of the Evil Lord\u2019s level would be able to resist it with their raw statistics alone and the Pleiades\u2019 equipment ought to have made them immune to all these effects. The main reason he had chosen this spell was because it also possessed a very powerful knockback effect.</div><div class=\"western\">Of course, Ainz would also be damaged by this spell. While friendly fire was off in YGGDRASIL and so using a spell this recklessly would not be a problem, right now he would be hurting himself. Even if his magical defense was very high, there was no need for him to go out of the way to take damage to cast his spell. Rather than act like a suicide bomber, he ought to have chosen another spell.</div><div class=\"western\">However, Ainz had already worked it out.</div><div class=\"western\">If he expended the \u300cBody of Effulgent Beryl\u300d spell to stop all the bludgeoning damage, the fire-elemental damage would also be negated, which would mean he would not be harmed. In addition, all those negative statuses were ineffective on the undead.</div><div class=\"western\">In other words, Ainz was undamaged by the spell.</div><div class=\"western\">If he completely resisted its damage, the knockback would not take effect either, and so Ainz was the only one left standing in the heart of the explosion.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHahah.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz laughed. The feeling of everything going as planned was very refreshing, after all.</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz\u2019s aim was to blow the enemy away and tear the enemy formation to shreds.</div><div class=\"western\">For a moment, Ainz briefly imagined the guild members who had taught him various things \u2015 including this tactic.</div><div class=\"western\">Both the earlier simulated battle and even this battle where failure meant death reminded Ainz of YGGDRASIL, which made him strangely happy.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>I\u2019ve wondered about this before, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a battle maniac\u2026</i></div><div class=\"western\">\u201cCome, it\u2019s not over yet. The battle\u2019s just beginning. I\u2019ll show you the strength that I nurtured with everyone.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Unleashing the fury of that 9th tier spell meant that the surrounding buildings had all been swept away, and there was much more space all of a sudden.</div><div class=\"western\">That could not be helped. After all, this city had outlived its usefulness.</div><div class=\"western\">He could have widened the spell to try and catch CZ in the blast. However, Ainz was worried about the problems that might result from destroying too much of the city, so he had not done so. For all he knew, it might have been a mistake.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Forget it, let\u2019s leave it at that. What\u2019s left is\u2015</i></div><div class=\"western\">Ainz looked in Lupusregina\u2019s direction. The enemy envelopment was in shambles.</div><div class=\"western\">Even with Aureole\u2019s buffs, they could not avoid the knockback, and Ainz could see the enemy hurriedly getting to their feet.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThat\u2019s about all the damage \u300cNuclear Blast\u300d ought to be able to do, so\u2015\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz flew towards Lupusregina and cast \u300cReality Slash\u300d.</div><div class=\"western\">This time, he was not interrupted by CZ, and Lupusregina\u2019s body spurted a fountain of blood.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u300cWiden Magic Shark Cyclone\u300d.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">An extra large cyclone came into existence behind him, swallowing up Yuri and the Evil Lord. This was both to obscure Yuri and the Evil Lord\u2019s vision and also to buy Ainz time. In truth, Ainz had planned to create a cyclone before the\u300cNuclear Blast\u300d to block their vision and then get rid of Yuri first, but after considering that the Evil Lord could probably break out of the spell easily, he decided not to go with that plan. Instead, he had decided to use it when the enemy was confused.</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz heard the sound of displaced stones as he saw Entoma push a pillar off herself while rising to her feet.</div><div class=\"western\">He had no idea where CZ was even now. Ideally, she would be pinned under a fallen house.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHe\u2019s coming here! Stop him!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Solution shouted from her place in front of Lupusregina, but her voice could not reach the ears of Yuri and the Evil Lord, who were inside the cyclone. Yuri in particular was shifting desperately within the cyclone to avoid being blown away. While certain classes could use spells or special abilities to teleport or go incorporeal and thus escape the cyclone easily, she did not seem to possess such abilities.</div><div class=\"western\">And that would mean Yuri had focused on strengthening other things\u2015</div><div class=\"western\"><i>After reviewing this battle, they ought to understand what gear they need to have and what preparations they need to make, right? No, that\u2019s not it\u2026</i></div><div class=\"western\">If they were the true Pleiades, they might have been able to deal with this better. They were simply Doppelgangers copying the Pleiades\u2019 abilities, after all. It only made sense that they would lose out to the real deal in terms of combat skills.</div><div class=\"western\">As Ainz closed the distance and prepared to cast \u300cReality Slash\u300d, bugs fell from the sky one after the other. They were large transport insects with no combat ability. The objective of this action was simply to block Ainz\u2019s line of sight.</div><div class=\"western\">Such a use would not be possible in YGGDRASIL. Even so, Entoma \u2015 though actually a Doppelganger \u2015 could use them in this way. Ainz gave thanks in his heart as he incanted a spell.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u300cGreater Teleportation\u300d.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">After teleporting into the air and avoiding the rain of bugs, Ainz cast \u300cTwin Maximize Magic Reality Slash\u300d.</div><div class=\"western\">Even if CZ had Ainz in his sights, the fact that her target had suddenly teleported into the air meant that she would lose him. After all, the weakness of the humanoid body was its inability to follow sudden up and down movement with the eyes.</div><div class=\"western\">That said, if he were facing an experienced shooter like Peroroncino, for example, they would be able to anticipate their opponent\u2019s movements, even in the vertical plane. Therefore, it was possible that one could not even escape with teleportation magic.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Peroroncino-san\u2019s aiming would have been like locking on to his target\u2026 CZ, you need to work hard to get on his level\u2026</i></div><div class=\"western\">As he basked in the nostalgia, Ainz shouted:</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cLupusregina, out!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Having to fight while keeping an eye on the HP of his opponents was very difficult. One could even call it a handicap. Therefore, if he was asked if Lupusregina\u2019s HP was really depleted, Ainz would not be able to reply with any confidence. Even so, he had to avoid any chance of killing Lupusregina because of a moment\u2019s carelessness.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>She\u2019s a Doppelganger, so not only is she weaker than the original, but her HP isn\u2019t the same as the original Lupusregina\u2019s. Alright, now that I\u2019ve taken out the enemy\u2019s magic caster, it\u2019s time to be a real bastard. </i><i>\u300c</i><i>Perfect Unknowable</i><i>\u300d</i><i>.</i></div><div class=\"western\">While there were ways to discover Ainz after he had cast \u300cPerfect Unknowable\u300d, without the aid of magic items, the only member of the Pleiades who could do it was Lupusregina, and the Evil Lord ought to be unable to detect him too. Therefore, it would probably be safe to say that they had no way to deal with this underhanded means of attack.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Since I\u2019ve taken out the enemy healer, I should go search for CZ. Don\u2019t tell me she\u2019s burning up consumable items?</i></div><div class=\"western\">Personally, Ainz could not forgive wasting the wealth of Nazarick on a battle like this.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWhere is he?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHe\u2019s gone! Is he using \u300cInvisibility\u300d?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI can find him if he\u2019s invisible! But he\u2019s not there!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIs this some other kind of invisibility?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">He could hear their confusion.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYou idiots! He\u2019s using \u300cPerfect Unknowable\u300d!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cLupusregina! You\u2019re cheating!\u201d Ainz shouted, but thanks to \u300cPerfect Unknowable\u300d, others could not hear him.</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz scratched his head.</div><div class=\"western\">The Evil Lord and Yuri seemed to have broken out of the cyclone, and they were now looking all around for Ainz. While the best option would have been to drop another \u300cNuclear Blast\u300d on them, that might end up killing Lupusregina, so Ainz abandoned that notion. Instead, he descended and kept tabs on Yuri\u2019s position at the same time. After that, he compared the amount of HP Yuri was missing to that of the others, and verified that in addition to the bludgeoning damage, she had also taken fire damage from the earlier magical attack\u2015</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u300cTriplet Maximize Magic Vermilion Nova\u300d!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz used the highest level \u2015 super tier magic notwithstanding \u2015 single target fire-element attack spell that he knew on Yuri.</div><div class=\"western\">It was only to be expected that there would be tenth tier spells that could do fire-element damage.</div><div class=\"western\">For instance, \u300cStream of Lava\u300d, \u300cUriel\u300d, and the like. However, the use of those presented problems for Ainz.</div><div class=\"western\">First off, Ainz could not cast \u300cStream of Lava\u300d. It was a divine spell which was only usable by a druid like Mare.</div><div class=\"western\">\u300cUriel\u300d, on the other hand, was a spell that could be learned by a magic caster of any type as long as the requirements to learn it were met, but it only did its listed damage when cast by a magic caster with a maxed-out positive karma value. Its damage decreased as one\u2019s karma value decreased, and for someone like Ainz, it would do less damage than a first tier spell.</div><div class=\"western\">Therefore, this spell was Ainz\u2019s only choice when it came to usability.</div><div class=\"western\">Yuri\u2019s health dropped drastically.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u300cPerfect Unknowable\u300d.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHe disappeared again!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThat\u2019s unfair!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIf only Ainz-sama would fight us fair and square!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\"><i>No, no, you\u2019re in the wrong for not even thinking of a way around this.</i></div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAnd besides, I have no idea where CZ is! You three never said anything about who was taking part in this battle! Now who\u2019s being unfair!?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz shouted, even though he knew the opposition could not hear him.</div><div class=\"western\">After coming to his senses, the Evil Lord charged at the place Ainz had been.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cToo bad, I\u2019m not there anymore~\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz had begun moving, so he was no longer there. However, he would still be within the area of effect if the Evil Lord decided to cast area-attack spells, but just as Ainz thought that, the Evil Lord suddenly changed direction and came straight at Ainz.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHah?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Was he not invisible? That question was soon pounded out of existence by the pain he felt.</div><div class=\"western\">The Evil Lord sent Ainz flying back. Since he was much more serious than just now, Ainz found it hard to defend against or evade the attack. No, Ainz had been too relaxed \u2015 he had not even thought of evading.</div><div class=\"western\">Fortunately, the \u300cFly\u300d spell helped control his posture and spared him the ignominy of rolling across the ground. It was just like how it had been during the battle with Shalltear.</div><div class=\"western\">The Evil Lord jumped over, hot on Ainz\u2019s heels, and his line of sight was most definitely tracking Ainz\u2019s flight path.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>\u2026The Evil Lord of Wrath shouldn\u2019t have the ability to see through it\u2026 Ah, he used it! His trump card, </i><i>\u300c</i><i>Soul-Bought Miracle</i><i>\u300d</i><i>!\u201d</i></div><div class=\"western\">Inspired by stories of selling one\u2019s soul to the devil to fulfill one\u2019s wishes, this ability was truly miraculous. While he was not sure how the procedure worked, once one used this ability, one could use any one spell of under the 8th tier once.</div><div class=\"western\">Normally, when Evil Lords used this ability, they would almost always use healing spells \u2015 that was an unwritten rule. However, this time he had probably used a spell to see through \u300cPerfect Unknowable\u300d.</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz silently gave thanks that the Evil Lord had used the ability of which he was the most wary, even as he felt the pressing need to formulate a new battle plan.</div><div class=\"western\">As the Evil Lord closed in and punched him again, Ainz began to get worried.</div><div class=\"western\">While there was quite a large level difference between the two and he still had some room for laxity, he could not simply allow himself to continue getting beaten up like this.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cCheh. Here, have some back. \u300cTriplet Maximize Magic Call Greater Thunder\u300d.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">High level demons had very high elemental resistances. While their exact resistances varied between type, electricity was one of the more effective energy types against them. After taking three hits of a maximized-damage elemental attack spell, the Evil Lord\u2019s body trembled.</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz cast another spell.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u300cPerfect Unknowable\u300d.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cCheeeeeap! Ainz-sama, you\u2019re so cheeeeeeap!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAhhh, seriously!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Entoma stomped in frustration, while Lupusregina rolled around on the ground. Solution was the only one who was surveying her surroundings with a razor-sharp gaze.</div><div class=\"western\">In theory, each individual mercenary vassal should have been identical, yet they had developed divergent personalities like this. Was it because they had copied the relationships between the members of the Pleiades? Or had their personalities changed over time? The Evil Lord before Ainz followed his movements closely and shouted:</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHere! Use area attacks here, hit me with it too!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Entoma did not hesitate, but breathed a black cloud from her mouth. It was her trump card, her Fly Breath.</div><div class=\"western\">However, it was useless against Ainz, because that move did piercing damage. In addition, Ainz was a skeleton; what would the flies eat? In the end, it only served to annoy the Evil Lord.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHey! It didn\u2019t work on him! It only works on me!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cEh!?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Being able to copy an ability and use it well were two different things altogether. Surely the real Entoma would not have made such an amateur mistake.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI don\u2019t have any area-effect attacks, how about you, Yuri-nee?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI\u2019ve got this!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Yuri gathered light between her palms.</div><div class=\"western\">The Kibakushou was a technique that acted as an anti-individual attack when it touched the enemy, but which became a spreading shockwave if it did not make contact. Naturally, as an attack intended for direct contact, it became very weak when dispersed. Since monks were a class focused on fighting individuals, they had very few area-effect attacks \u2015 practically none, in fact \u2015 therefore one could say that it was completely useless.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThere! He moved!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHere?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Yuri launched her area Kibakushou at the location where Ainz had been. Ainz wrinkled his brow \u2015 despite having no brow \u2015 as he saw this and reached a hand out.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026No, no, you should have prioritized healing.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Yuri could have healed herself with her ki.</div><div class=\"western\">After making his jab at Yuri, Ainz cast his spell. Needless to say, it was a spell that he already knew to be effective.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u300cTwin Maximize Magic Vermilion Nova\u300d.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Having cast an attack spell, Ainz came into view. He looked at Yuri, who was wreathed in flames, and made a cold pronouncement.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYuri, out \u2015 \u300cPerfect Unknowable\u300d.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\"></div><div class=\"western\"><i>Now then, things will get bad if I don\u2019t look for CZ in earnest. </i>Having made that decision, Ainz began making a big detour as he kept an eye on the Evil Lord.</div><div class=\"western\"><b>Part 3</b></div><div class=\"western\"></div><div class=\"western\">Many people stood on the city walls with Neia, watching the battle unfold.</div><div class=\"western\">While many of them were people who had been swayed to the Sorcerer King\u2019s side after he had rescued them, they were not the only ones here.</div><div class=\"western\">There were priests and paladins here as well. Neia could not see Remedios from where she was standing, but she was close enough that Neia could hear her speak.</div><div class=\"western\">The only members of the command staff who were absent were Gustav and Caspond.</div><div class=\"western\">Everyone watching the battle was silent \u2015 no. It was simply because there were no words to describe the battle.</div><div class=\"western\">They should have known this.</div><div class=\"western\">The members of Blue Rose had said that Jaldabaoth\u2019s difficulty rating was above 200. In other words, this was like fighting a huge dragon in the form of a human. Just fighting said battle in the land of men would lead to a great tragedy.</div><div class=\"western\">They ought to have been grateful that only a single city district was destroyed. Many houses were on fire and white plumes of smoke reached to the sky, but the total casualties were almost nil.</div><div class=\"western\">While watching the battle, she had seen cyclones, blazes, strokes of lightning and other tremendous manifestations of power that were beyond man\u2019s knowledge running wild. Each of these discharges of energy could have easily taken countless lives.</div><div class=\"western\">Especially\u2015</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">What had truly moved Neia\u2019s heart was the ball of white light that she had seen twice.</div><div class=\"western\">It was power which consumed everything and made it disappear without a trace. It felt like something good to Neia, although she could not confirm whether it was truly the work of divine might. The incredible devastation she saw in the wake of the light\u2019s disappearance frightened her, but her admiration of its great power had won out in the end.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>It seems the fighting is still going on. I can\u2019t believe the battle still isn\u2019t over after using all those spells\u2026 Jaldabaoth is really strong.</i></div><div class=\"western\">She had heard about it, and she had even seen it with her own eyes. Yet, Neia\u2019s thinking had still been too naive. That naivete was now thoroughly eradicated.</div><div class=\"western\">The king she served \u2015 though only temporarily, and only within the Holy Kingdom \u2015 was fighting. She felt that searing his heroic visage into her eyes was only natural as part of her squire\u2019s duties, which was why Neia was keeping watch from here. Yet, if she could\u2015</div><div class=\"western\">\u2015Neia tightly squeezed the bow she was carrying.</div><div class=\"western\">If one looked closely, they would see several other shapes battling the Sorcerer King in addition to Jaldabaoth. Those were the maid demons, who were rated at difficulty 150. Neia could not do anything but admire the Sorcerer King\u2019s power for fighting so many powerful adversaries at once without giving ground.</div><div class=\"western\">It was at this moment that Neia finally realized something about herself. She envied the people of the Sorcerous Kingdom \u2015 those people who were protected by justice. How happy they must be to live in a country ruled by such a being.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWeakness is a sin, so one must become strong, or humbly accept justice similar to that of His Majesty.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">At this point, Neia voiced the words she had been mulling over all this time. The way she repeated it over and over sounded very much like a prayer.</div><div class=\"western\">Suddenly, there was a large explosion as a meteor fell.</div><div class=\"western\">It threw the carcasses of buildings high into the air, and they rained back down to the earth amidst a shower of gravel and sand.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cCaptain\u2026 isn\u2019t Jaldabaoth\u2026 too powerful?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThe Sorcerer King \u2015 His Majesty is also incredibly strong. If he becomes an enemy of our nation\u2026 what will we do?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cCaptain?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">She could hear Remedios talking to three paladins.</div><div class=\"western\">The paladins asking her questions had probably not seen how Remedios had ended up being toyed with like a child even after unleashing the holy sword\u2019s power and stabbing Jaldabaoth in the back.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Ahh, maybe they didn\u2019t see it. </i>Still, anyone who saw that fight would have understood. Both the Sorcerer King and Jaldabaoth were unimaginably powerful. Still, it was too late to think about things like that now. No\u2015</div><div class=\"western\"><i>If His Majesty could take this country under his rule, we would not have to suffer demihuman invasions again.</i></div><div class=\"western\">Neia was startled at how perfect that idea was, and even a little afraid.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Merging with the Holy Kingdom\u2026 if he were a frightening tyrant, even I wouldn\u2019t think about it. But the Sorcerer King isn\u2019t like that. He is justice. In that case\u2026 I ought to gather people who feel the same way as me!</i></div><div class=\"western\">Neia pondered the matter.</div><div class=\"western\">Many people had come to respect and idolize the Sorcerer King. There were those who were drawn to his overwhelming power, those who were grateful for being freed from suffering, those who hated the demihumans and who were glad that he had taken revenge on their behalf, and many such others.</div><div class=\"western\">From them she would select those people who had always been praying for the peace of this country, and then let them hear her words.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia knew that she was still young and lacked life experience. However, adults with good sense could stop Neia if they felt that her judgement was in error.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Let\u2019s start by looking among my subordinates in the archery unit.</i></div><div class=\"western\">There were people among them who had lost their loved ones and harbored hate in their hearts. It might be better to try persuading them, because Neia could understand how they felt.</div><div class=\"western\">As she pondered this, she heard a <i>doom</i> as an exceptionally large explosion rang out.</div><div class=\"western\">After that, a tall building began to collapse far in the distance.</div><div class=\"western\">The Sorcerer King would not have destroyed that building for no reason. Neia narrowed her eyes to try and see what was going on, but she could not tell what was happening in the building as it collapsed amidst billowing clouds of dust.</div><div class=\"western\">It was followed by a massive stroke of lightning from the sky.</div><div class=\"western\">It would seem he was working towards some objective here, as she had expected.</div><div class=\"western\">After a while, all manner of spells wrecked the city, and the situation repeated itself.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia was uneasy.</div><div class=\"western\">That they were incredible spells went without saying, but could the Sorcerer King\u2019s mana really hold out?</div><div class=\"western\">Neia shook her head and banished the fear and unease from her heart.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>It\u2019ll be fine! The Sorcerer King must have taken all this into account! He\u2019s already wasted so much mana on this country, but even so\u2015</i></div><div class=\"western\">Still, hypothetically, if Jaldabaoth won, there would be no salvation for this world, only despair. What should she do if that happened?</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Your Majesty, I\u2019m counting on you!</i></div><div class=\"western\">And then, two shapes soared into the sky, as though Neia\u2019s wish had gotten through.</div><div class=\"western\">The first to ascend trailed darkness in his wake, while the one pursuing him flapped his crimson wings and left a streak of fire behind him.</div><div class=\"western\">The fact that the maids were not pursuing them meant one thing \u2015 the Sorcerer King had defeated those difficulty 150 monsters among monsters while battling Jaldabaoth.</div><div class=\"western\">\u2015<i>He\u2019s amazing!</i></div><div class=\"western\">Neia was so moved that she shivered.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>His Majesty is more powerful than Jaldabaoth!</i></div><div class=\"western\">Indeed. There was no need to think anything else.</div><div class=\"western\">In turn, the maids were far weaker than Jaldabaoth, who was a notch below the Sorcerer King. That was why he could defeat them while fighting Jaldabaoth.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia struggled to contain her delight. As she carefully engraved the greatness of the person she respected into her eyes, she was so filled with joy that it seemed like it would explode out of her.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia\u2019s heart pounded, to the point where it almost hurt.</div><div class=\"western\">They were all watching a scene that would one day be enshrined in a heroic saga.</div><div class=\"western\">\u2015<i>No, that\u2019s not right.</i></div><div class=\"western\">It would seem they were going to fight again in the air.</div><div class=\"western\">Crimson spheres and glowing spheres blossomed in the sky.</div><div class=\"western\">Each of these spells could probably destroy an entire city district by themselves, and they were hurling them at each other in wild flurries. However, they looked kind of cute from a distance.</div><div class=\"western\">Even so, that was an exchange of power within a realm that mankind could never reach.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>This is\u2026</i></div><div class=\"western\">As she looked out the corner of her eyes, she saw the people lining the city walls gulping as they saw all this. It would seem that they understood as well. They watched the aerial battle in silence, with earnest looks on their faces.</div><div class=\"western\">Someone put his hands together in prayer, and the people beside him followed suit \u2015 and soon almost everyone on the city walls had their hands together as they looked to the sky.</div><div class=\"western\">It felt like they were at worship.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>\u2026This is mythology\u2026</i></div><div class=\"western\">Neia did not know how much time had passed, but eventually \u2015 there was a commotion among the people.</div><div class=\"western\">Before everyone\u2019s eyes, one of the shapes in the sky fell towards the east \u2015 and then it vanished.</div><div class=\"western\">The battle was over.</div><div class=\"western\">As everyone watched closely, the remaining shape slowly descended. Neia\u2019s vision was better than most, and so she saw it first. It shocked her so much that she had to press her hand over her mouth.</div><div class=\"western\">When the others saw the crimson fire, the city walls were silent. However, nobody tried to flee. Everyone who had seen the battle knew that there was no point in running.</div><div class=\"western\">With a flap of his fiery wings, the victor (Jaldabaoth) showed himself.</div><div class=\"western\">Though he was the victor in name, he was a tragic sight.</div><div class=\"western\">His entire body was covered in electrical scorch marks. Half his face seemed to have been crushed, and his deep wounds oozed fresh blood. Perhaps it was due to its temperature, but the blood sizzled as it touched the city walls, and the sound did not stop for a moment.</div><div class=\"western\">No words could have described the intensity of their battle better than the way he looked now.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cNo way\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">A weighty, yet somewhat pained voice echoed across the city walls, as though to wipe away Neia\u2019s muttering.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026What a mighty opponent. One of the strongest I faced since Momon. I underestimated him. How foolish. Leading the demihumans nearly became meaningless. However \u2015 yes, however, he is dead.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Neia could not believe this. Therefore, she cried out:</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYou\u2019re lying!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Jaldabaoth turned his intact eye toward Neia, but she did not budge despite being bathed in the gaze of a creature from a completely different order of life. The intense emotions within her heart left no room for fear to enter.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI am not lying.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHis Majesty is very bad at jokes\u2026 so you\u2019re lying, right?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI am not lying.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The words Jaldabaoth had repeated hit Neia hard enough to shatter her soul.</div><div class=\"western\">The world seemed to shake under her feet.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia instantly understood why the Sorcerer King had lost to Jaldabaoth. There was no need to even think about it.</div><div class=\"western\">It was simply because this country lacked Blue Rose\u2019s Evileye and Darkness\u2019s Nabe, the two magic casters who could hold the maid demons at bay.</div><div class=\"western\">No, there was another reason apart from that.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIf that undead had been in top condition, I might have been defeated instead. But to think he actually expended his mana for the sake of humans like you \u2015 truly, he was a fool who did not know his priorities. For that, I thank you.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\"><i>I knew it! I knew it, weakness truly is a sin!</i></div><div class=\"western\">Neia was absolutely certain that she was correct.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cFor that I shall reward you. The reward shall be your lives.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026What do you mean?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Jaldabaoth snorted in delight at the question from an unknown source.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI\u2019m saying that I will spare you. At least, for now.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Someone sighed in relief, but Neia was furious.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cBullshit! Bullshit! Bullshit! It\u2019s all a pack of lies! Everything you say is a lie! Who would believe what a devil says!?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIt seems you are unable to accept reality. Are you mad, human? Pitiful.\u201d Jaldabaoth pointed to Neia. \u201cDisapp\u2026 I see,\u201d and then he immediately withdrew the finger.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Jaldabaoth!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYou intend to provoke me and thus prove I am lying? \u2026Is losing your life worth that much? I cannot understand it, but it seems to be the case.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Neia\u2019s teeth creaked as she clenched them.</div><div class=\"western\">Jaldabaoth had to be lying.</div><div class=\"western\">He had to be a liar, the kind who would tell a ridiculous lie like the Sorcerer King was dead.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI will not allow it. Your lives have been saved. Now then, I will return for now. I must recover from these wounds. During that time, you may weep your tears of despair.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">As Jaldabaoth was about to take off with a flap of his wings, Neia\u2019s hands moved with a mind of their own.</div><div class=\"western\">She readied her bow \u2015 and let loose a shot.</div><div class=\"western\">She had fired from directly behind him, without giving any warning of her intentions.</div><div class=\"western\">However, Jaldabaoth immediately turned and seized the arrow. Despite his terrible wounds, he was still very agile.</div><div class=\"western\">Jaldabaoth turned to face Neia, and then his eyes went to Neia\u2019s bow, the Ultimate Shootingstar Super. After that, his wrath-twisted feature changed slightly.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cOhh!? Ah! What an incredible weapon this is! I haven\u2019t seen a weapon like this in so long! That was close, it almost finished me off!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Jaldabaoth gesticulated wildly with his limbs as he said that. He seemed composed, but also quite anxious.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWhat kind of weapon is this!? How was it made?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAs if I\u2019d tell you!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\"><i>What on earth is he thinking?</i> Neia\u2019s mind boiled over with scorching hate.</div><div class=\"western\">How could she tell this liar what she had learned from the Sorcerer King?</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHow could I tell a liar like you!?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cMuu, ah, don\u2019t, don\u2019t tell me, was it made by runecraft?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Naia\u2019s heart lurched for a moment as he hit the nail on the head. Although she had managed to calm down a little, as her broken heart recalled the compassionate figure of the Sorcerer King once more, her anger reawakened.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYou\u2019re wrong!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Neia screamed like she cared for nothing else, and Jaldabaoth groaned. Taking that as an opening, Neia fired again.</div><div class=\"western\">Her next target was his feet, which were hard for the hands to reach.</div><div class=\"western\">This time, Jaldabaoth frantically moved his feet to avoid the arrow.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>He\u2019s wary of it! Maybe this bow could\u2015!</i></div><div class=\"western\">There could only be one reason why Jaldabaoth had so desperately evaded her shot when he had been indifferent to being stabbed in the back by the holy sword. What else could it be, if not that this bow could harm him?</div><div class=\"western\">A wave of regret assaulted Neia as her eyes filled with tears.</div><div class=\"western\">She realized that she should have joined that battle, even if she would have perished swiftly. If she could have hit him with the Ultimate Shootingstar Super, then she should have taken part, even if it was just to be a shield. If she had, then maybe\u2015</div><div class=\"western\">Neia launched another arrow.</div><div class=\"western\">Jaldabaoth moved his head. The arrow missed and flew off to parts unknown.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHit, damn you!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">She fired again.</div><div class=\"western\">And again.</div><div class=\"western\">But none of her shots found their mark. Despite his size and his severe wounds, Jaldabaoth had still evaded Neia\u2019s attacks with startling ease.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cRune\u2015\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2015Shut up!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Neia fired another arrow to shut Jaldabaoth up.</div><div class=\"western\">However, it too missed.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Why? Why isn\u2019t anyone attacking?</i></div><div class=\"western\">She could understand their inability to strike Jaldabaoth because he was airborne. However, even so, how could they simply let the lying demon who had killed the most merciful Sorcerer King go free?</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c..Muu. Well, eh, I guess it can\u2019t be helped\u2026 no? \u300cGreater Teleportation\u300d.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Jaldabaoth suddenly vanished.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cGet back here!!!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Neia looked around.</div><div class=\"western\">All she saw were the wide-eyed faces of people who were shocked by what Neia had done. Jaldabaoth was nowhere in sight.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cMotherfucker! He ran away!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cCalm down!\u201d Remedios shouted.</div><div class=\"western\">The angry cry of a mighty being could exert a pressure of its own, and normally it would have brought Neia back to her senses or even made her freeze up. However, it did little more than annoy Neia right now.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHow can I calm down!?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cSquire Neia Baraja! Did you borrow that weapon from the Sorcerer King? Why was he so interested in it?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cDon\u2019t ask me irrelevant questions like that! More importantly, we need to find His Majesty! I saw him fall to the east! We need to send out a rescue party!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cSurely he must be dead.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHow could he be dead!? How could His Majesty die!?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Neia instinctively grabbed Remedios, but Remedios easily swept her aside and Neia fell to the ground.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHave you cooled off yet? Nobody could survive a fall from that height.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cCooled off? You actually believe that demon\u2019s words? Captain, did you sell your soul to him!?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios\u2019s expression changed, and then it seized up.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cSquire! Damn you, there are things you can and can\u2019t say!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">She grabbed Neia\u2019s collar with tremendous force, and Neia found it hard to breathe.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYou two! Calm down! Calm down right now!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The paladins, priests, soldiers, and such hurriedly made their way between Neia and Remedios, and pulled them apart.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia panted with all her might as she shouted:</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWe need to send out a team to rescue His Majesty!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWe can\u2019t waste our resources on that!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHow dare you call it a waste!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Neia wanted to go up and punch Remedios, but the people between them stopped her.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI\u2019ve got nothing to say to you!\u201d Having cooled down a little, Neia addressed the people holding her.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cCould you let go of me? There\u2019s something I have to do.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWhere are you going !?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">In response to that question, Neia looked at Remedios with an utterly incredulous expression on her face.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWhat kind of eyes are those!? Is that how a squire should look at a paladin!?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Hmph,</i> Neia snorted.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cFirst, I will be asking His Highness the Prince to organize a rescue party for the Sorcerer King. After that, I will go straight to the Sorcerous Kingdom and tell them exactly what happened to His Majesty, and then I will ask for aid for His Majesty.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Given the circumstances, nothing good would come of going to the Sorcerous Kingdom. Even so, she was still the Sorcerer King\u2019s squire, and she had to complete her duty.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia was unsure if she could safely reach the Sorcerous Kingdom from here, but she had to go, even if it meant her death.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cOhhh, if you\u2019re going to the Sorcerous Kingdom, let me go with you, Baraja-san!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The person who spoke was a middle-aged ex-soldier, who had retired and become a hunter. He had been lauded for his archery and had joined Neia\u2019s unit.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me, I\u2019m old enough as it is. I don\u2019t have much longer left.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cBaldem-san!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">From his tone, she knew that he understood what sort of fate awaited him even if they reached the Sorcerous Kingdom safely.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHey, Neia-chan. Don\u2019t forget me!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYou too, Codina-san!?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI\u2019ll go too, lil\u2019 miss. Not for you, but if it\u2019s for the Sorcerer King then it can\u2019t be helped.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cEven you, Mena-san?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">All the skilled people in Neia\u2019s unit stepped forward, one after the other. With their help, it might be possible for them to reach the Sorcerous Kingdom safely. However\u2015</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThank you very much. But everyone, could you join the rescue party?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWhat are you saying? You were all gathered to rescue the Holy Kingdom and the suffering people from the clutches of that demon, weren\u2019t you? Where are your priorities!?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWhat are <i>you</i> saying, Captain!? Could anything be more important than rescuing His Majesty!?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cOf course! Right now, at this very moment, how many people of the Holy Kingdom do you think there are living in the hell the demihumans made for them!? Could anything be more important than rescuing them!?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cOf course! That\u2019s\u2015\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2015What on earth are you doing!? What\u2019s all this shouting for!?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The argument immediately stopped when the interloper showed up. It was Caspond.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cCaptain Custodio, should you not have returned immediately? Where is His Majesty? What about Jaldabaoth? What happened? Could somebody please explain?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Caspond sounded like he was completely lost, and his voice echoed loudly in the crushing silence.</div><div class=\"western\"></div><div class=\"western\">***</div><div class=\"western\"></div><div class=\"western\">The meeting room was very cramped. It was filled with paladins, priests, nobles who had been prisoners until recently, and honorary paladins. That said, there were no better rooms for them, since Jaldabaoth had destroyed the one which Caspond had previously used.</div><div class=\"western\">Caspond had called an emergency meeting after receiving a report from a paladin, and he had instructed all key personnel to gather in this room.</div><div class=\"western\">After everyone had assembled, Caspond and Remedios entered with quick strides.</div><div class=\"western\">Everyone bowed as the prince entered. Neia was one of them, because she held no grudges against Caspond.</div><div class=\"western\">Caspond stood in front of everyone and began to speak.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThank you all for coming here. I wish to discuss the course of action we will adopt in the future.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Although it was supposed to be a discussion, there was only one thing Neia had to do, and she was certain that it was the right thing to do. Just as Neia was about to speak, Caspond raised his hand to stop her.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI\u2019m sure everyone has concerns of their own, but I pray you will hear me out first.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Caspond slowly swept his gaze over everyone gathered here.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI believe many people have witnessed the extent to which Jaldabaoth\u2019s strength exceeds our imagination\u2026 yes. While I regret to say this, we must accept the fact that nobody in this country can triumph over him.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Several people frowned in silence, then peeked at Remedios, who had been hailed as the strongest in the Holy Kingdom. After learning that she agreed with Caspond\u2019s opinion, hints of fear and disappointment appeared on their faces.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHowever, it is too early to give in to despair. If we cannot defeat him, then we will derail his plans in some other way and make him give up on trying to conquer the Holy Kingdom. We will not drive him out directly, but indirectly.\u201d Caspond waited several seconds for his words to sink in, and then spoke his conclusion, \u201cWhat we will do is slaughter all the demihumans he leads.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWhy are we doing that?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Caspond saw someone asking a question and nodded to them.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIn the past, Jaldabaoth made trouble in the Kingdom. Back then, he fought a certain warrior in a duel, and then he lost and ran away. At that time, he led an army of demons, but not an army of demihumans. In other words, he came to lead the demihuman army after losing to that warrior.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Caspond looked around, as if to see if everyone understood.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIn other words, he is using the demihuman army as meat shields to avoid being forced into a one-on-one battle with that warrior. Didn\u2019t Jaldabaoth say something like that when he defeated His Majesty? Something about leading the demihuman army almost becoming meaningless, or something.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">It made sense.</div><div class=\"western\">Back then, they did not understand it, but after hearing that explanation, it was hard to think of any other reason.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIn other words, the demihuman army is like armor and stamina for when he fights that warrior again. What will Jaldabaoth do if he loses the demihuman army? Will he remain stripped of his armor and stamina, when that warrior might appear in front of him again at any moment? Or perhaps \u2015 would he choose to flee?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI see\u2026 then do you intend to abandon this city, defeat the southern demihuman army, and then join forces with the South to drive out the demihumans?\u201d a priest asked. He was answered by one of the rescued nobles.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThat would be good. Thanks to the Sorcerer King\u2019s power, almost 40,000 demihumans have been wiped out. The demihumans have lost a great deal of their fighting strength, no? The remainder ought to be staring down the South. If we rally all the people this city has rescued for an all-out attack and strike them from the back in a pincer attack, we ought to be able to rout the demihuman army. That way, we will be able to join up with the Southern forces and take back our land.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2015I propose the opposite. We will take back the closest major city in the west, which is the northern stronghold of Kalinsha.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWhy is that, may I ask?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cExactly! All the major cities to the west such as Kalinsha, Prart, Rimun and the capital of Hoburns will be very hard to take. Many lives will be lost. Why don\u2019t we fight the southern demihumans instead? Would destroying the demihumans\u2019 fighting power not fit more with your plans, my Prince?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI see. All of your concerns are valid. I am grateful for the fact that many of the people present here are wise. However, is that an action which everyone can understand?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">There were baffled looks on the faces of many of the people present.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHow about this? Going to the south implies that we will be abandoning \u2015 though it is only temporary, we are still abandoning them \u2015 all the imprisoned people that we will not rescue as a result. Can the masses \u2015 can the people understand that?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThat, that\u2026 but that makes more sense, there\u2019ll be a higher chance of saving them, no?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a baron, I believe?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Caspond turned to look at the middle-aged man who had asked the question.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cY-Yes. I believe we met once, My Prince.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAhh, just so. Now, have all the people of your domain been rescued?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAh, no, not yet. I was imprisoned when I took the field beside Her Majesty, so I don\u2019t know about my domain\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI see. So when you join up with the Southern forces and take back the North, people might say you fled to the South.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The nobleman\u2019s face froze up.</div><div class=\"western\">When one thought calmly about it, the nobleman was right. However, there was no guarantee that everyone \u2015 especially those who were writhing in agony \u2015 would be able to see the sense in what the nobleman had said. It was possible that there would be people who would say \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you save us earlier, our families were slaughtered by the demihumans,\u201d and turn the blades of their hatred on the nobles. Neia had seen such people before.</div><div class=\"western\">However, nobody had said that in the prison camps which the Sorcerer King had liberated. Given his overwhelmingly potent magic \u2015 which could sometimes wreck city walls in a single blast \u2015 and the fact that he was the king of another nation, nobody would dare take their anger out on him.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAlso, I had been intending to speak to the landholders one-on-one after this. In this case, we might as well do it now\u2026 We are all exhausted. In contrast, what will the nobles of the South do? In particular, what will the other nobles do about nobles who have abandoned their fiefs?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The cloying stench of politics and power began to fill the air.</div><div class=\"western\">While it sounded unbelievable to Neia, was this what the nobles wanted? They nodded repeatedly.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cMy Prince. Our domains\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI want you to pretend that you did not hear what comes next. That is because I cannot guarantee you anything. However, the Southern nobles will probably grow more powerful all of a sudden. That is why you must pick the best move to make, with an eye for what happens after the war.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cA moment please!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">One of the paladins called out to him.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHow can we shed more of the people\u2019s blood for courtly disputes!?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIndeed! Indeed!\u201d The priest called Siliaco shouted in a voice which was said to have been trained for volume. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is how to save more people!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026Driving out the demihumans doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s all over, you know? If the South takes all the credit, then we\u2019ll have a hard time refusing the demands of the Southern nobles. And there\u2019s no guarantee that they won\u2019t impose heavy taxes on the exhausted people.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026Now that the Holy Queen is dead, it would be very bad if the next Holy King were to be chosen by the Southern nobles. However, if we can show concrete results with our strength, then at least\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">There were two factions in the room now.</div><div class=\"western\">They were the nobles\u2019 faction and the paladins and priests\u2019 faction.</div><div class=\"western\">Both sides were at odds. Speaking of Remedios, the paladins were trying to spoonfeed her a simplified version of what the Prince had said.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia was not part of either faction. She simply followed the flow of the conversation in silence. That was because Neia had already made up her mind about what she would be doing, so it did not matter what conclusion they reached in the end. Rather she wanted to bring up her own suggestion and set out as soon as possible.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>That said, talking about irrelevant things here will only ruin the mood, and people who might have helped me won\u2019t come to my aid\u2026</i></div><div class=\"western\">After listening to numerous boring topics, she decided to toss the ball back to Caspond once both sides had worn themselves out with arguing.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThe My Prince brought up this topic. Perhaps we should let him finish speaking?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAhh. Like I said earlier, I intend to take back Kalinsha. This is also militarily advantageous. In truth, this city is far too cramped, and much of it has already been destroyed. Living here is difficult, so I would like to have a larger, more solid home base. In addition, by taking back a major city, we\u2019ll have an advantage when dealing with the Southern nobles. Also, Kalinsha was meant to stop enemy advances, so it ought to have ample stores of military supplies, assuming they haven\u2019t been moved out yet.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026I support the proposal to secure a better base.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAhhh, I\u2019m a little uneasy about the sanitation of a city like this. Many people are shivering from the cold too.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">However, they went on to say, \u201cWe need to avoid large numbers of deaths.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIndeed. That is why it is the best time to attack the enemy strongholds. After all, Jaldabaoth cannot take action now.\u201dThere was no telling how long Jaldabaoth\u2019s wounds would take to heal, but surely he would recover before the demihuman army was completely defeated.</div><div class=\"western\">In addition, it was very unlikely that he would show his face before making a complete recovery. After knowing of the existence of a powerful warrior like Momon, he would surely take the possibility of Momon showing up into consideration before doing anything. Therefore, if he acted, it would not happen before he was almost completely recovered.</div><div class=\"western\">That said, once Jaldabaoth took the field, it would not matter how much force the Holy Kingdom could muster. Therefore, they had to take the fortress now.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>So that was it.</i> After listening to that agreeable explanation, Neia expressed her approval as well.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2015In that case, it seems the only thing you are unhappy with is the number of people who must die for this. Can I take that to mean that you will give me your support if I can minimize the number of deaths?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Everyone present nodded, with the exception of Remedios. Neia did not mind either way, but after considering the flow of the conversation, she realized that it would be bad if only one person was not nodding, and so she nodded with everyone else.</div><div class=\"western\">As for Remedios, several people looked at her face and saw that she did not seem to have any special reasons for what she did, so they chose to ignore her.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIt\u2019s decided then. We will discuss the details of retaking Kalinsha afterwards. Now then \u2015 our next item.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Caspond sighed loudly and then turned to Neia.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThis concerns the death of the Sorcerer King.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cMy Prince, I sincerely apologize, but I hope you will amend that statement immediately. The Sorcerer King\u2019s death remains in question. That was simply what Jaldabaoth told us. It would be foolish to take a demon\u2019s words at face value.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Neia eyed Remedios and continued, \u201cI think it is more likely that he is trying to deceive us.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIn that case, why has he not come back? He can cast teleportation spells, can\u2019t he?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cPerhaps he was immobilized by his wounds, perhaps he is out of mana. There could be any number of reasons for it.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios did not ask any further.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThat\u2019s true. That\u2019s why I\u2019d like to hear from all of you. What do you think we should do?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThere\u2019s no point in asking what we should do!\u201d Neia shouted, forcing the words out like she was trying to strain them out through her teeth. \u201c\u2026I think we should dispatch a rescue party and relay this news to the Sorcerous Kingdom at the same time. If possible, I would like to be the messenger.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI see. That\u2019s what you think, Squire Baraja. How about the others?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">As Caspond looked over the gathered people, one of the nobles spoke up.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI have a question. While the Sorcerer King was supposed to have gone down in the east, considering we will be mounting a rescue operation in demihuman-controlled territory, would it not be better to wait until we have some concrete intelligence before\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIt\u2019ll be too late by then,\u201d Neia immediately shot back. \u201cThe more we delay, the more His Majesty will be exposed to danger. I suggest we make our rescue as soon as possible.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The majority agreed with Neia\u2019s opinion. What she said made perfect sense.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIn that case, we ought to send out a search party at the same time as the envoys to the Sorcerous Kingdom.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026I have something I would like to confirm with you, since you have the role of His Majesty\u2019s squire. Do you think the Sorcerer King told the people of his country that he was coming to the Holy Kingdom?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Neia began to think.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI apologize, but I am not sure. However, I feel it would not be strange for him to have told the people of the Sorcerous Kingdom, because there were times when he returned to his country with teleportation spells.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIn that case, I feel we should not send an envoy to the Sorcerous Kingdom.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWhy!?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Neia glared at the noble who had done nothing but naysay. The noble retreated two steps and his face went pale under that glare. The people around that noble also backed away from him.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cNo, ah, please calm down and listen. That, uh, that is because it will bring trouble. Wait! Please calm down and listen to me. When you think about it normally, the possibility exists that the Sorcerous Kingdom\u2019s undead armies would take revenge on us, am I wrong? And revenge would be one thing; they might annex the Holy Kingdom as well. And\u2026 ah, why is that? Who\u2019s to say the Sorcerer King was not aiming for that all along?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cExcuse me!\u201d Neia was so angry that she actually felt dizzy. \u201cIn that case, permit me to ask a question of my own! If His Majesty returned to his country by teleportation, what will he think of the Holy Kingdom, who knew what happened but said nothing?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Everyone she could see nodded in agreement. Amidst all this, Remedios spoke.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWell, it can\u2019t be helped then, can it? Our country doesn\u2019t have the luxury of doing that now. All we have to do is apologize after everything is over, right?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cEven if you\u2015\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Neia was so worked up that she was about to shout, and then she heard the sound of clapping from beside her. She looked over, and saw that it was Caspond. Since the Prince wanted to speak, all Neia could do was remain silent.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cSquire Baraja. Allow me to pick the people who will go to the Sorcerous Kingdom. How about that? After all, if we send over a mere squire as a messenger, won\u2019t the other country think we\u2019re making fun of them?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThat, that is as you say\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">His explanation made perfect sense. Under normal circumstances, they would surely pick a country\u2019s ambassador over a squire who had borrowed a magic bow from the Sorcerer King. However, would he really send out an envoy? She found that part hard to believe. Even so, it would be very bad to show that she did not trust the Prince\u2019s words.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI am glad that you understand.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIn that case, please allow me to lead several people to the east.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIndeed. I would very much like to send you as well, but we still do not know where the Sorcerer King fell. He might be ten kilometers away or a hundred. If things go badly, he might have fallen into the Abelion Hills, which Jaldabaoth controls. Even if I allowed you to go to such a desolate place, would you have any means of finding the Sorcerer King?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Neia could not answer him.</div><div class=\"western\">Finding where the demihumans lived in unfamiliar terrain was an impossible task. She could easily imagine the scouting team meeting with difficulties and being wiped out.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cSurviving in the hills, slipping past demihuman observation and gathering information,\u201d Caspond counted off on his fingers. \u201cIf you go there without preparing, you will simply be killing yourself indirectly, and what good is a rescue party that ends in failure?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThen, then do you have another way!?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cOf course.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cEh?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\"><i>How could there be?</i> As she thought about that question, it was easily answered. Neia\u2019s eyes went wide in surprise, and then Caspond adjusted himself before telling Neia the answer.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAll you need is to find someone who knows the hills.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Neia blinked, and Caspond smiled to her.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cListen. All we need to do is to take a demihuman captive and have him lead the way. Would it not be safer to order a demihuman to act as your guide?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAh.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Indeed, that was the case. Humans would be taking an absurd risk entering that land. However, it would be a different matter if they had guides.</div><div class=\"western\">However, there were also problems with it which could not be ignored.</div><div class=\"western\">If they simply threatened a demihuman prisoner into showing them the way, then if the prisoner was willing to sacrifice himself to kill them all, the search party would be going to their deaths. The Orcs she had met earlier seemed like the type who did not care about whether they lived or died.</div><div class=\"western\">They would need trustworthy demihumans, but where would they find those?</div><div class=\"western\">What could she do to make a demihuman act as a reliable guide?</div><div class=\"western\">Neia racked her brains, but when she thought of demihumans, she could only think of them trying to kill her, and she could not imagine them accepting an offer to turn their coats.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>No, the Orcs and the Grand King Buser felt like humans \u2015 I see, take their relatives hostage\u2026 no, if we could take a king like Buser prisoner, his tribe would probably obey us.</i></div><div class=\"western\">Or on the other hand, the angered tribe might put up stiff resistance. Besides, how would they capture a mighty demihuman king like Buser\u2015</div><div class=\"western\">As Neia wandered aimlessly in a mental labyrinth, chasing an answer she could not find, the room\u2019s door swung open and a paladin barged in.</div><div class=\"western\">He panted heavily and looked around the interior of the room, but he approached Caspond instead of Remedios.</div><div class=\"western\">Perhaps he did not want others to hear what news he had. He brought the Prince to a corner of the room and whispered in his ear, but Neia\u2019s keen hearing picked up snippets of their exchange. Among them, the last piece of information piqued her interest.</div><div class=\"western\">He had said \u201cmaid demons.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\"></div><div class=\"western\">\u201cGentlemen, something urgent has come up, Unfortunately, the meeting will end here. I hope you will begin working on ways to take back Kalinsha. Also, Captain Custodio, come with me.\u201d</div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

That was thanks to his fur. His entire body was covered in lustrous black fur, and wearing a set of clothes on top of that would provide for excellent insulation. He would not shiver even if he wore a suit of metallic full plate armor instead.</div><div class=\"western\">However, he was shivering for a different reason now.</div><div class=\"western\">That reason was anger.</div><div class=\"western\">Calling that tremendous anger \u201cwrath\u201d would not be too far off.</div><div class=\"western\">A low growl escaped him \u2014 like that which a carnivorous beast would make \u2014 and he clicked his tongue in embarrassment.</div><div class=\"western\">For members of his race \u2015 the Zoastia \u2015 making animal noises was proof that they could not control their emotions; a shameful display for an adult.</div><div class=\"western\">However, that was only among fellow members of his species.</div><div class=\"western\">Anyone else who heard that growl leak from between his sharp teeth would have been trembling in fear or frozen in terror.</div><div class=\"western\">He turned his back on the human city which he had been staring at just now and returned to his camp.</div><div class=\"western\">Their supreme commander was Jaldabaoth, their ruler who wielded overwhelming might. Many races were gathered beneath him, and many pointless disputes broke out between them every day.</div><div class=\"western\">The forces of the Demihuman Alliance were divided into three main detachments.</div><div class=\"western\">The first were the 40,000 troops arrayed against the Southern Holy Kingdom\u2019s military.</div><div class=\"western\">The second were the 50,000 troops responsible for managing and guarding the camps which held prisoners from the Holy Kingdom.</div><div class=\"western\">The third were the 10,000 troops responsible for scouting the Northern Holy Kingdom, recovering various resources, and other miscellaneous tasks.</div><div class=\"western\">The personnel here comprised 40,000 of the 50,000 troops allocated to managing the prison camps.</div><div class=\"western\">It was only natural that with such numbers in attendance their campgrounds would be bustling, yet nobody blocked his path, and he did not stop or even slow his pace.</div><div class=\"western\">Surely there was nobody in the world who would dare stand in the path of a massive, rolling boulder.</div><div class=\"western\">Nobody present dared stand in his way, given the air of dominance around him.</div><div class=\"western\">He walked as though he were alone in a wasteland, and soon a particularly ostentatious tent came into view.</div><div class=\"western\">There were demihuman soldiers standing before it, but they were not guards. They were there to heed the orders of the tent\u2019s occupants. In other words, they were servants.</div><div class=\"western\">They fearfully cleared a path for him, and he savagely pulled aside the cloth hanging over its entrance, whereupon the five demihumans within immediately glared sharply at him.</div><div class=\"western\">The demihumans within could be counted among the top ten members of the demihuman forces, demons excepted. While he could feel the physical weight of their gazes upon him, his calm demeanor did not change in the slightest.</div><div class=\"western\">As a fellow member of those ten beings, he instead snorted and plopped himself down onto one of the empty seats. That said, his bestial lower body meant that taking a seat was more like lying down.</div><div class=\"western\">Although one of the five nodded lightly to him, he paid that person no heed as his eyes fixed firmly on the demihuman occupying the seat of honor.</div><div class=\"western\">Said demihuman was a being that looked like a snake that had grown arms.</div><div class=\"western\">The scales on its body had a wet sheen to them and threw off a bizarre riot of colors that did justice to its nickname of \u201cRainbow Scales.\u201d Not only were they beautiful, their hardness was said to rival those of Dragons. In addition, it possessed high-level magic resistance and was equipped with a large shield and a suit of enchanted plate armor. When one factored in its warrior prowess as well, said being might well qualify as the toughest entity in the Abelion Hills.</div><div class=\"western\">This demihuman was Rokesh of the Nagarajas. He was the demihuman who had been appointed as commander of this detachment by the Demon Emperor.</div><div class=\"western\">Resting beside him was his favored weapon, the Trident of Desiccation which possessed a dreadful power.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2015Why aren\u2019t we attacking yet?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">He directed the question to Rokesh in a subdued tone.</div><div class=\"western\">It had been a full three days since they had reached the city which the pitiful human resistance had taken over, yet not even a skirmish had broken out since then.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026I know the human walls are troublesome, but surely they\u2019re nothing in the face of our numbers, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">This was especially true for those members of the Demihuman Alliance who could completely disregard the existence of such walls. There ought to be no difficulty if said individuals were carefully managed.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cFrightened, are we?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cDemon Claw-dono.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">A vicious expression bloomed on his \u2015 Vijar Lajandala\u2019s \u2015 face as he was addressed with the title of \u201cDemon Claw.\u201d He swept his eyes over the other member of his species who was present before turning back towards the Nagaraja.</div><div class=\"western\">The title of \u201cDemon Claw\u201d was known throughout the foothills, and had been for almost two centuries now.</div><div class=\"western\">This was not because Zoastias were a long-lived race but because the title was passed down through the generations.</div><div class=\"western\">To him, this title was something he had inherited from his father. He knew very well that it was inappropriate for him at the moment. That was why he had to build his reputation in the upcoming series of battles. Yet, he had not been able to prove his strength \u2015 as the inheritor of the title \u2015 to the world so far.</div><div class=\"western\">Everyone he had beaten so far was weak. There had not been any who could take more than a single blow from his enchanted two-handed battleaxe, \u201cEdge Wing.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">This state of affairs could not be allowed to continue.</div><div class=\"western\">He could not allow this war to end while others still knew him as a mere minion of the archfiend Jaldabaoth. He needed a chance to make a name for himself as a warrior, and now was the time.</div><div class=\"western\">However, Rokesh still did not intend to attack. Vijar\u2019s dissatisfaction with that decision was why he spoke to the former in that way.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThey say the Grand King used to hold that city. Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re scared just because the enemy has someone who could defeat him?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The Grand King \u2015 the king who had led the Bafolk to greatness.</div><div class=\"western\">He had been one of the top ten demihumans, like himself.</div><div class=\"western\">Vijar was confident that he stood on even footing with the Grand King, despite the latter\u2019s annoying martial arts which could break weapons. Anyone who could beat the Grand King must surely be a worthy opponent.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI\u2019ll deal with her, so why aren\u2019t we attacking yet?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">He could think of only one person who could defeat someone of the Grand King\u2019s power.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>It must be that female human paladin from the rumors. If what they say is true, she might have been able to beat the Grand King.</i></div><div class=\"western\">He sketched a hazy image of a paladin with a glowing sword in his mind.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cVijar-dono. The fact that you, a commander, would say such things despite coming in late without a word of apology makes me\u2026 don\u2019t get so excited, I know, I know.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Rokesh waved him off in a relaxed fashion.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cMy my. Ignorant chicks do make a lot of noise even when they know nothing.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The person who was snickering just now had four arms. She was the queen of the Magilos, a woman with the moniker of \u201cIceflame Lightning\u201d \u2015 Nasrene Bert Kiuru.</div><div class=\"western\">Vijar wrinkled his brow.</div><div class=\"western\">He felt that he could beat her in a melee fight, but Nasrene was adept at magic, so he was afraid she could turn the tables on him in some unexpected way if it came to a fight. Even so, he \u2015 as an inheritor of the name \u201cDemon Claw\u201d \u2015 would not be able to face his ancestors if he meekly let someone call him a chick.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAnd old hags who like to sit on their asses cause trouble for the rest of us too.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The Magilos were quite long-lived, but she ought to have been more than halfway through her lifespan, given that Vijar had heard of her nickname throughout the hills when he was a child.</div><div class=\"western\">He could not tell the age of her skin when inspecting her face due to all the cosmetics she wore, but the fact that she was covering it up meant that she must have felt her age too. In addition, surely that floral fragrance surrounding her was a sign of using perfume to mask her old folks\u2019 stench, was it not?</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2015Ho.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Nasrene narrowed her eyes and an icy chill filled the air in the tent. This was a physical, not psychological phenomenon.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2015I\u2019m not lying, am I?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Vijar straightened himself up as he said that. A Zoastia\u2019s lower body was not a pretty decoration, but something which possessed a beast\u2019s dexterity and explosive power. While his usual fighting style would have involved hunkering down for a charge in order to make full use of his physical abilities, he did not do that now. That was because he wanted to present himself as the one with the advantage, who had simply ceded the initiative to his opposition.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThis isn\u2019t just a matter of lying, is it? I ought to teach you how to address ladies with respect. That\u2019s also my duty as your predecessor.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Amidst all this tension, Rokesh spoke up:</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cContain yourselves, you two. This is a war council. If the two of you continue making trouble here, I\u2019ll have to report this to Jaldabaoth-sama.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Now that Rokesh had brought up the name of their absolute superior, the two of them had no choice but to back down. Still, they continued glaring at each other, as though to say \u201cThis isn\u2019t over yet,\u201d and \u201cYou start a fight and I\u2019ll finish it.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHah\u2026 well, as someone who\u2019s strong myself, I know you can\u2019t really help being strong, but you two ought to know what it means to cooperate.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHeeheehee, you don\u2019t have the right to comment on others either.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">A simian demihuman covered in white fur jeered at Rokesh\u2019s grumbling with a laugh.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHm, that\u2019s true. Now then, Demon Claw-dono. About your question earlier, it is not that I am afraid. The Grand King was a valiant individual, but surely everyone present is his equal, am I wrong?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Rokesh looked to Demon Claw and Iceflame Lightning, and then to the remaining three people.</div><div class=\"western\">One of them was an ape-like demihuman who was covered in long white fur. He wore many protective items made of gold.</div><div class=\"western\">He was the king of the Stone Eaters \u2015 Harisha Ankara.</div><div class=\"western\">As a superior specimen of his species, he and others like him could gain various special abilities from eating raw minerals. For instance, by eating diamonds, they could temporarily gain physical damage resistance which could only be bypassed by bludgeoning attacks. Usually, only three such abilities could be active at once, but he could stock far more than that number. That was also a reason why he was called a mutant.</div><div class=\"western\">Then, there was the Orthros general who had nodded to him as he had entered the tent.</div><div class=\"western\">He wore a suit of intricately carved armor. His equally ornate helmet and his cavalry lance lay beside him. His name was Hektowyzes Ah Rahgara.</div><div class=\"western\">His nod to Vijar was not out of respect for Vijar\u2019s personal abilities, but towards the Zoastia species as a whole. That was the reason why it made Vijar unhappy.</div><div class=\"western\">Still, he could not simply challenge Hektowyzes to a duel to prove his strength. Certainly, Vijar would be the victor in a one-on-one fight. However, Hektowyzes had not gained fame because of his individual might, but because he was a renowned general who could triumph despite having a tenth of his opponent\u2019s forces. The tables would be turned if it came to mass combat, and there was nothing more shameful than crowing about one\u2019s personal strength and saying \u201cI\u2019m stronger than you\u201d while knowing this. That was why Vijar had a hard time dealing with that Orthros.</div><div class=\"western\">The last person was the fellow member of his species, who had remained silent all this while: Muar Praksha.</div><div class=\"western\">Also known as \u201cBlacksteel,\u201d he was a ranger who was often called a shadow running through the darkness.</div><div class=\"western\">He was a rarity among the Zoastia, who typically took advantage of their physical gifts and fought with brute force. He used stealth, surprise, and cunning techniques as part of his fearsome assassination skills. His nickname came from his unshakable will and the fact that he would eliminate any quarry he had marked.</div><div class=\"western\">While he did not think he would lose to them, every person seated here would be a troublesome opponent for him in a straight fight.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThen let\u2019s go back to the topic of why we\u2019re not attacking them. That would be because I received orders from Jaldabaoth-sama in the city of Rimun.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWhat\u2019s that? Is that true?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Vijar\u2019s question was due to the fact that among this army of 40,000, Rokesh was the only one who had had direct contact with Jaldabaoth. By the time the others had been summoned to this city of Kalinsha, his men were already in fighting order and waiting to be deployed.</div><div class=\"western\">Jaldabaoth was always teleporting between multiple cities, so there were few opportunities to receive directions from him in person.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cJaldabaoth-sama said to give the humans occupying the city several days\u2019 time.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cGive them time? Whatever for?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHe said it was to frighten them. There are fewer than 10,000 people in that city. There are fewer still people among them who can fight. In contrast, all of us here can fight\u2026 how afraid do you think the humans holed up in that city will be?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI see\u2026 so that\u2019s it. Jaldabaoth-sama is truly fearsome.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHeeheehee, indeed. That said, I do understand how you feel, Vijar-dono. The question now is how much more time we should give them?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cNo, we can decide exactly how many more days to give them. That said, we might have two months\u2019 of rations stored up, but it would not be good to actually give them that long.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIs it because we still need to deal with the prisoners?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">There were only 10,000 demihumans left to manage an overwhelming number of human captives. While demihumans were stronger than humans, quantity was a quality all of its own. It was very likely that they would not be able to deal with any riots or uprisings.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cPrecisely. That\u2019s why I have gathered all of you here, in order to hash out our plans for the future. Personally, I think we can make our move after another couple of days and wrap things up. Does anyone disagree?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">None of the demihumans present \u2015 Vijar included \u2015 objected to him.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAll right. We attack in two days. We will continue observing them until then.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">There was the possibility the enemy might launch a counterattack, though he did not think it very likely.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThat would mean it\u2019s about time to deal with the humans we\u2019ve brought along, then.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Some demihumans ate human beings. Species like those preferred fresh food. The Zoastia had no particular preference for manflesh. To them, beef and horse meat were better. However, most of them would prefer fresh human meat to beef jerky.</div><div class=\"western\">In contrast, Iceflame Lightning had a look of revulsion on her face. Perhaps it was because the Magilos did not eat humans, as they were visually similar to human beings.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHeeheehee. How about killing and eating them in front of their city tomorrow. That ought to terrorize them, no?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAn excellent idea. After that, we\u2019ll declare that we\u2019re attacking the next day\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThere\u2019s no need to press them that hard. What\u2019ll happen if they surrender? Fighting is only fun because they have hope, and thus struggle with all their might. Nothing\u2019s more boring than killing people who have lost the will to live.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Vijar wanted to fight strong foes. There was no point in facing weaklings.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIndeed. Also, there is another important point. This is an order from Jaldabaoth-sama. We must not kill them all, but let a few escape. Therefore, my plan is to kill everyone guarding the western gate \u2015 our side \u2015 and chase away the ones manning the eastern gate.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIn other words, whoever\u2019s attacking the eastern gate needs to be able to keep firm control over their men, am I right? Otherwise, it feels like it\u2019ll end in a complete slaughter.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">After Nasrene said that, everyone\u2019s eyes went to a single individual.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI see\u2026 Then you won\u2019t mind if I bring all my kin with me, then?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cCan you leave a few as messengers?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cCertainly, Rokesh-dono. In that case, Hektowyzes Ah Rahgara and myself will be responsible for the eastern gate.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAfter that, we need some people on the north and south walls to give them some pressure. While there\u2019s no need to actually take those points, we ought to kill off an appropriate number of defenders there. I\u2019d like to send some ranged fighters over\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">There were three people present who were adept at long-range combat. The person Rokesh chose from among them was the silent Zoastia.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cMuar Praksha-dono.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2015Acknowledged.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">That was all \u201cBlacksteel\u201d said in reply.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cEveryone else will be on the western gate. While I don\u2019t think there\u2019ll be a chance for you to show your stuff, I\u2019ll leave any strong opponents that show up there to you. After all, I need to command the entire army, so I won\u2019t be able to make it to the frontline.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The remaining three demihumans \u2015 Vijar included \u2015 all nodded their heads.</div><div class=\"western\"></div><div class=\"western\">\u201cSince we are all in agreement, we shall attack that city in two days. I hope you will all get your rest and gather your strength before the humans wail in despair.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\"></div><div class=\"western\"><b>Part 2</b></div><div class=\"western\"></div><div class=\"western\">Neia swallowed the stomach acid rising inside her as she walked towards the Sorcerer King\u2019s room. As she did, an intense sourness spread through her mouth.</div><div class=\"western\">She took up the pouch tied to her belt and drank the water within.</div><div class=\"western\">The water tasted bad since it was tainted by the odor of the leather which held it, but it helped quell the burning sensation in her throat and the stench in her mouth. However, the anger still remained in Neia\u2019s chest, and her face was still pale.</div><div class=\"western\">She recalled the stomach-churning scene that she could not forget, even if she wanted to.</div><div class=\"western\">The demihuman army had encircled this city for a full three days now.</div><div class=\"western\">The enemy had not attacked or attempted to parley, simply letting time pass. But today, the demihumans had brought out their captives from the Holy Kingdom to the outer walls of the Loyds district, where Neia had been posted. If they had skilled archers or slingers present, they might have been able to launch an attack, but they unfortunately had nobody like that on hand.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia was confident of hitting the demihumans if she used the Sorcerer King\u2019s bow. However, launching a rash strike may have triggered an all-out attack. That would have led to a battle of 10,000 against 40,000, and they would have to open the city gates if they wanted to save those captives.</div><div class=\"western\">Once the gates were opened, the demihuman forces would surely pour in like an avalanche. Such a thing could not be allowed to happen, and so all they could do was stand aside and watch.</div><div class=\"western\">There were less than twenty captives. They were made up of males and females, adults and children, but there were no old people among them. All the prisoners were naked and covered in scars and bruises.</div><div class=\"western\">Just as the gathered people of the Holy Kingdom began to think they had been brought out as collateral for some kind of negotiations, a tragedy unfolded.</div><div class=\"western\">The demihumans began to kill the captives.</div><div class=\"western\">A demihuman who seemed to be about three meters tall had decapitated a prisoner and then raised the severed head in an inverted position. Neia had clearly seen how the earth had drunk the vast quantities of fresh red blood spilled upon it.</div><div class=\"western\">After that, the demihumans began to butcher the prisoners\u2019 corpses.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia had seen her father process animal carcasses before. However, the sight of such a thing happening to human beings dealt a mighty blow to Neia\u2019s psyche.</div><div class=\"western\">After that, the demihumans ate the captives one after the other, while they were still fresh.</div><div class=\"western\">The most cruel part was watching how some people had been eaten alive.</div><div class=\"western\">Even now, Neia\u2019s ears still rang with a child\u2019s cries as a demihuman chewed his belly open. It was accompanied by the sound of his innards being torn out.</div><div class=\"western\">Fortunately, Gustavo had been wise enough to keep Remedios from following him, under the pretext of protecting the prince. Surely they would have been fighting by now if she had seen something like that.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia sighed deeply, then took another mouthful of water and forced herself to swallow it.</div><div class=\"western\">She had heard someone say that it would feel better to throw up if one was nauseous, but given that she was heading to the Sorcerer King\u2019s room, it would be disrespectful to arrive with the stench of vomit clinging to her.</div><div class=\"western\">After checking her breath several times, Neia stood before the door to the Sorcerer King\u2019s room.</div><div class=\"western\">There was nobody on either side of the door.</div><div class=\"western\">Now that the city had been encircled by the demihumans, there was nobody to spare on protecting \u2015 or rather, keeping an eye on \u2015 the Sorcerer King.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia knocked on the door to indicate her presence to the person within.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYour Majesty, I am Squire Neia Baraja. May I enter?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cCome in.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">After receiving permission, Neia quietly entered through the room\u2019s door.</div><div class=\"western\">The interior was simply furnished since the demihumans had wrecked most of it. Even so, it was still more than what anyone else in the city had.</div><div class=\"western\">The Sorcerer King stood with his back to Neia as he looked outside the window.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIt seems quite chaotic outside, given how I\u2019ve seen so many people running around from up here. We\u2019ve been encircled for four days, but this is the noisiest it\u2019s been since the first day. That would mean\u2026 are there signs that the enemy is preparing to attack?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The Sorcerer King had shown no intention of participating in this battle, simply staying in his room without incident. He had not even shown up for the strategic meeting when the demihuman army began fanning out around the city.</div><div class=\"western\">Naturally, the Liberation Army\u2019s leadership had not been happy about this, but they found it very hard to ask anything of the Sorcerer King after he had said, \u201cAfter taking future matters into consideration, don\u2019t you think it would be bad if the king of another nation stuck his nose into your business?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Neia had been ordered to attend various meetings in his place. This was the Liberation Army\u2019s plan to share what they knew with the Sorcerer King, and Neia approved of it. However, that had led to Neia witnessing the tragedy which had unfolded earlier.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026No, the demihumans haven\u2019t made any big moves like that. But\u2026 the demihumans, ah\u2026 how shall I put this, maybe they are trying to make a show of force, so their positions have shifted a little.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI see. In that case, this standoff will only continue for a while more, no? The demihumans are trying to shake your troops and weaken their morale\u2026 come to think of it, do you think you can win this battle?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\"><i>No.</i> Neia longed to say as much.</div><div class=\"western\">For starters, there was a vast difference in the respective strength of their forces.</div><div class=\"western\">10,000 humans versus 40,000 demihumans.</div><div class=\"western\">Even that figure of 10,000 included the elderly and children. In addition, they had not yet fully recovered from the wounds \u2015 both physical and mental \u2015 and the fatigue they had incurred at the prison camps.</div><div class=\"western\">While the defenders typically had the advantage during a siege, that only applied when both forces were evenly matched</div><div class=\"western\">When one compared the average demihuman to a human commoner, the latter was so weak that even comparing them seemed like a foolish act.</div><div class=\"western\">At the very most, the only people who could stand on equal footing with demihumans were the paladins, the priests, and professional soldiers, but they did not have many of those. Compared to the 40,000 strong army they were now facing, it was as pointless as trying to put out a Fire Dragon\u2019s breath with a bucket of water.</div><div class=\"western\">Still, one could not say this was an entirely unwinnable battle.</div><div class=\"western\">There was one person who could beat back the demihuman hordes by themselves, even without counting the Sorcerer King.</div><div class=\"western\">Assuming physical exhaustion and lucky hits from the enemy were not a factor, the strongest paladin in the Holy Kingdom \u2015 Remedios Custodio \u2015 could take on about 40,000 demihumans and kill them all.</div><div class=\"western\">However, one could not say there were no powerful individuals in the demihuman army who could stand toe-to-toe with Remedios. In fact, it was very likely that there were such beings out there.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia recalled the Grand King Buser, the demihuman who had previously ruled this city. While the Sorcerer King had killed him like he was nothing more than a pile of rubbish, that was simply because the Sorcerer King was incredibly powerful. Buser was overwhelmingly strong in his own right. Neia could not have beaten him, no matter how hard she tried.</div><div class=\"western\">Demihuman kings like that might be Remedios\u2019s equals, or perhaps even her superiors. They were all very strong in Neia\u2019s estimation, so she could not accurately judge the outcome of a showdown between two such powerful beings.</div><div class=\"western\">In addition, physical exhaustion had to be taken into consideration if one was being realistic. No matter how strong they were, nobody could escape the spectre of fatigue. Magic could briefly ease it, but fatigue would continue to accumulate once more.</div><div class=\"western\">Even after killing an army of 10,000, Remedios could still be attacked in a moment of exhaustion and weakness and be killed by an average demihuman. Quantity had a quality of its own, after all.</div><div class=\"western\">However, if there was some being who could overturn that logic \u2015 Neia\u2019s eyes went to the great ruler who still stood with his back to her.</div><div class=\"western\"></div><div class=\"western\">That person would be an absolute force.</div><div class=\"western\">An entity who surpassed this world (Overlord).</div><div class=\"western\">He was none other than the Sorcerer King, Ainz Ooal Gown.</div><div class=\"western\"></div><div class=\"western\">As Neia gazed upon his regal back, she suddenly realized that she had not yet answered the Sorcerer King\u2019s question, and she hurriedly spoke.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI, I\u2019m not sure!\u201d Panic caused her to exclaim louder than usual and she blushed before continuing in a normal tone, \u201c\u2015Therefore, I\u2019ll do my best to find out.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The Sorcerer King seemed entirely unmoved by this, and asked another question.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI see. Then, have you learned anything new about the enemy? Have you verified Jaldabaoth\u2019s presence?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThe situation on that front has not changed in the past few days. We have not yet sighted Jaldabaoth among the demihuman forces.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHm. That makes things difficult. It may be very hard for me to help you in this defense. After all, I need to replenish the mana I\u2019ve used up. I must consider the possibility that his plan might be to deprive me of mana before I take any action.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cBut of course. Everyone is fully aware of Your Majesty\u2019s opinion.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">During a strategy meeting, someone had once said they had spotted a demon who looked like Jaldabaoth, but when Neia said they had to make sure, that person had immediately said they had probably been mistaken. Given the mood in the air, it was clear that everyone present \u2015 with the exception of Neia \u2015 was planning to involve the Sorcerer King in the fighting by spreading false reports of Jaldabaoth\u2019s presence.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>They might despise the undead, but lying to the king of a nation means they have no integrity to speak of. Even when backed into a corner, isn\u2019t it proper to display their best side to someone who ought to be respected?</i></div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIn that case, what do you make of the demihumans\u2019 movements?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAh, yes, the demihumans had been previously massing at the west gate, but now they\u2019ve split their forces and are sending some of their troops to the other \u2015 the eastern \u2015 gate. We believe they\u2019re about to make their move \u2015 probably preparing for a siege.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThat is to say, enough time has passed for them to finish building siege weapons, then? Well, that\u2019s probably a good thing. After all, the enemy isn\u2019t trying to starve you out.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Neia could not tell if it was a good or a bad thing, but they would have no response to starvation tactics.</div><div class=\"western\">If the demihumans attacked on an open field, then they would be promptly annihilated due to the opposition\u2019s overwhelming advantage in military strength. However, if they were fighting from behind the protection of the city walls, it would not be such a lopsided battle. Of course, that was merely going from \u201cincredibly bad odds\u201d to \u201cpretty bad odds.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cOf course, that might also be due to the fact that the demihumans aren\u2019t aware of our supply situation. Then again, it\u2019s more likely that they simply don\u2019t care about a small city like this.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWell, the demihumans did conquer the fortress line we saw when we entered the Holy Kingdom, so it would be reasonable for them to hold a small city like this in low regard\u2026 if you give them a hard time during the defense and make them feel that a siege is to their disadvantage, that\u2019ll draw the battle out. After that, you\u2019ll have a very hard fight ahead of you.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">It appeared that the Sorcerer King believed that they would have to win this unwinnable battle before the true battle began.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYour Majesty, may I ask your opinion of how you think the situation will develop?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cFuture developments, hm. I don\u2019t honestly know. In truth, one could say that you\u2019ve lost by being forced to hole up within the city. Taking shelter in a city is typically done under the pretext that reinforcements will arrive. Either that, or the enemy is operating under a time limit or something similar. However, you are simply defending a city in enemy territory, so your chances of victory are despairingly small.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cStill, we managed to send the nobles we freed to the south before this, so we can\u2019t say for certain that no help will arrive.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Neia might have said those words, but she knew in her heart that she should not be counting on reinforcements.</div><div class=\"western\">The southern armies would need to break through the Demihuman Alliance forces blocking their path to reach Neia\u2019s location, and even if they did that, there was still an army of 40,000 demihumans to contend with.</div><div class=\"western\">Fighting repeated battles would be a huge drain on their combat strength. It would be wiser to abandon the 10,000 people in this city.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThat would be good\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">It would seem the Sorcerer King did not believe it for a moment either.</div><div class=\"western\">But that was only to be expected. Given the circumstances, who could turn things around without sacrificing anyone\u2015</div><div class=\"western\">Neia dispelled the notion rising in her head.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>His Majesty is here to fight Jaldabaoth, so diminishing his chances of victory by having him waste mana on unrelated manners cannot be allowed.</i></div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026It will take me a while before I can once again cast the teleportation spell which I used on the Orcs, but I can still cast the spell which I occasionally use to return to the Sorcerous Kingdom several more times. Taking a few dozen people with me would not be a problem\u2026 but I guess you can\u2019t decide who to send, and you won\u2019t.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI am grateful for your understanding, Your Majesty.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Perhaps it would have been a better idea to ask the Sorcerer King to take Prince Caspond and flee, but that move was of dubious merit.</div><div class=\"western\">When a king from another nation was willing to commit himself to a fight in order to face a fearsome demon, having a member of one\u2019s own royal family shamelessly beg someone else to take them away from the battlefield was utterly disgraceful.</div><div class=\"western\">Just as Neia was pondering this information, the Sorcerer King turned to face her for the first time since she had entered the room.</div><div class=\"western\">The red points of light in his empty eye-sockets looked straight at Neia. While they had once frightened her, Neia had grown used to them, and she had come to feel that they were quite attractive.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThis is what I think, Miss Baraja. We have ended up in a confrontation with the enemy forces because of the stupidity of the Liberation Army\u2019s leadership. Such a situation cannot be changed by the efforts of a single squire. How about focusing on your personal safety rather than the big picture? You do understand that my nation will accept your allegiance, if you are willing to give it? Given that you have been trained as a paladin, I am certain you will be able to fully exercise your talents in my country.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Neia did not know how to answer, and she hesitated.</div><div class=\"western\">While she was grateful that the Sorcerer King was concerned about her, she trembled in fear as she considered what she might lose if she accepted the Sorcerer King\u2019s proposal.</div><div class=\"western\">The sacrifice which her parents had made.</div><div class=\"western\">Her love for her hometown.</div><div class=\"western\">She might never be able to return to the nation of her birth.</div><div class=\"western\">She remembered several friends she had made.</div><div class=\"western\">Many things circled in front of Neia\u2019s eyes, and they disappeared one after the other with a <i>poof</i>, but among them was something that refused to shatter, that remained to the end \u2015 in other words, the most important thing.</div><div class=\"western\">She was a member of the paladin corps.</div><div class=\"western\">While she did not yet know what was justice, it was the only thing Neia could say with her chest puffed out and her head held high.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAs a citizen of the Holy Kingdom, I feel I am bound to save as many of the people as I am able. That is because saving the helpless \u2015 saving those in suffering is common sense.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The Sorcerer King suddenly stopped moving, as though he had been frozen in place.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026Hm.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The Sorcerer King murmured to himself, and then he stroked his chin.</div><div class=\"western\">It would seem Neia\u2019s words had struck a chord with the Sorcerer King, because he studied Neia once more.</div><div class=\"western\">It was just a throwaway remark, and Neia found herself fidgeting uncomfortably.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAm I correct to say that when the demihumans attack, you will be posted to the walls near the western gate, on the left side of the city? It is a very dangerous place, and counting on me to save you will be a mistake, you know?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI know that very well.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Neia was skilled in archery, and given that she had been assigned to the thick of the action, there was no doubt that she would be killed in action. However, she had steeled herself for death, since she would be going onto the battlefield.</div><div class=\"western\">She drew her lips thin, and Neia looked the Sorcerer King in the eye.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAhh, those are his eyes. I liked those eyes.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The Sorcerer King\u2019s self-directed mutterings made Neia blush. While the Sorcerer King probably did not mean anything else by his words, hearing someone she respected say that he liked her made quite an impact.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIn that case\u2026 I\u2019ll lend you several things, Miss Baraja. Please make good use of them.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">There was a <i>whoosh</i> as something huge suddenly appeared out of thin air. The same thought had crossed her mind when the Sorcerer King had produced the bow in the carriage, but magic truly was a surprising thing.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia had seen the magic item \u2015 the suit of armor \u2015 which had sprung forth from nothing. It was a suit of armor which looked like a green carapace, which the late Grand King Buser had worn.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThis, this is\u2015\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThis armor ought to be useful, by which I mean it will ensure your safety.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The armor was too large for Neia \u2015 and its dimensions would be quite sizable for just about any human being. However, given what Neia knew about enchanted armor, it would not be an issue if she tried it on.</div><div class=\"western\">Ordinary armor would need to be altered by a blacksmith in order to suit its wearer\u2019s frame. However, there was a limit to how far such alterations could go. Such a large suit of armor simply could not be resized enough to fit.</div><div class=\"western\">However, it was different for magical armor. Anyone could wear it regardless of gender or race, provided there were no special restrictions on its use. While the changes would not be too drastic, the armor would automatically adjust its shape to fit its wearer.</div><div class=\"western\">One could even have a giant wear a suit of armor no bigger than his own thumb, but the durability of magic armor varied with the materials it was made with and their quality. A ring-sized suit of armor would be easily damaged if it was subjected to spells, acidic, or equipment-sundering attacks, and that would greatly reduce the potency of the enchantments upon it.</div><div class=\"western\">There was no such thing as a free lunch, and so-called shortcuts often did not work out. Even so, Buser\u2019s armor was probably quite tough, given that it was this size even without anyone wearing it.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIn addition, I will lend you three more things.\u201d The Sorcerer King personally handed those items to Neia. \u201cA circlet, gauntlets, and a necklace. Are any of them redundant with your personal gear?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cNo, not at all. I did not have any magic items to begin with.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cExcellent. Now, I will briefly explain how to use these items.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">As the name implied, the Circlet of Iron Will defended the mind against charm, fear, and other such mental attacks. Still, while the circlet rendered one immune to magical attacks, it could only strengthen the wearer\u2019s resistance against attacks derived from special abilities. Another thing she had to note was that the circlet would also negate positive magical effects.</div><div class=\"western\">The gauntlets were Gauntlets of Archery. Out of all the spells in the world, there were some which could only be used if their caster possessed shooting skills, which was why the Sorcerer King had made that item. However, the Sorcerer King had abandoned those spells after making that item, and so the gauntlets were useless to him. They had languished in storage until now.</div><div class=\"western\">Finally, the necklace was an item that consumed mana to cast the Third Tier divine spell \u300cHeavy Recover\u300d. While one could use it indefinitely as long as one possessed sufficient mana, it consumed more magical power than casting it directly. Given Neia\u2019s meager reserves of mana, it was best for her to consider it a one-use item. Therefore, she would have to think carefully about when to best use it. This item had not been made by the Sorcerer King or his peers; he had simply been taken with its appearance and had purchased it from somewhere.</div><div class=\"western\">Indeed, a closer look revealed that the necklace was of very fine workmanship. It looked like a goddess holding up an emerald. Indeed, it was a very attractive work of art.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia looked at these valuable items, and then shook her head in refusal.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI, I\u2019m very sorry, Your Majesty, but I cannot accept these items.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The magic items that the Sorcerer King offered were most definitely top notch gear. However, what would happen if Neia died while wearing them? These items would fall into the hands of the demihumans, and they would end up strengthening the demihumans instead. Even if they did not fall into the hands of the demihumans, what would happen if her corpse went missing during the chaos of battle and her equipment vanished with her? More to the point, Neia already had the bow which the Sorcerer King had bestowed upon her, so how could she be discontent with that and borrow more things from him?</div><div class=\"western\">Speaking of which, she ought to return that bow to the Sorcerer King before going to battle.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWhy is that? These items will be useful to you in the fighting to come, will it not? After all, you are a warrior-type, and you lack mana, so you might not even be able to use that necklace\u2019s ability. Why don\u2019t you take it and give it a try?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Neia confessed her uneasiness in response to the Sorcerer King\u2019s question. The Sorcerer King heard her words and simply smiled.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHow about this? Go onto the battlefield with the determination to bring these items back to me, no matter the cost.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Neia had been resolved to do just that all along, but resolve alone could not break through her uneasiness. After hearing her answer, the Sorcerer King waved his hand in a magnanimous fashion.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cOh, just take them. I have spells that can locate magic items. I can find them even if they\u2019re lost.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIs that so?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYes, it is\u2026 all right, no need to stand on ceremony. Make use of them.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">If the Sorcerer King could make facial expressions, he would have probably been smiling \u2015 those thoughts ran through Neia\u2019s mind as she heard his kind words.</div><div class=\"western\">Now that he had offered them with such sincerity, rejecting them would be an act of rudeness. The notion of accepting his goodwill warred with the desire to apologize for incurring a loss to the Sorcerous Kingdom. Those thoughts swirled in Neia\u2019s mind\u2015</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWell? Can you not make me a promise? A promise to return them all to me afterwards?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Come back alive.</i> That was the meaning behind those words, and they moistened the corners of her eyes with tears. Only her parents had ever treated her with such kindness before.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>The Sorcerous Kingdom is blessed to have such a merciful sovereign.</i> As Neia thought that, she bit her lip and lowered her head.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThank you very much! I swear I will return them!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026Hm.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">She lifted her head, and wiped away the tears</div><div class=\"western\">She could not put the armor on here after all. However, putting on the gauntlets, necklace, and circlet should not be an issue. She began by fastening the necklace around her neck.</div><div class=\"western\">In the moment that she put it on, she immediately understood the abilities of the magic item and how to use them. It was as though the item was a part of her, and making use of it was as natural and effortless as using her own limbs</div><div class=\"western\">Next was the circlet. However, she did not feel anything special when she put it on. Still, according to the previous explanation, she would probably understand when the time came.</div><div class=\"western\">The last item was the gauntlets.</div><div class=\"western\">Unlike the others, she could clearly feel the difference.</div><div class=\"western\">Power coursed through her.</div><div class=\"western\">It felt very much like the time she had strengthening magic cast upon her. Her muscles felt like they had suddenly doubled and her movements were both swifter and more precise. In addition, she could make out tiny details, and even her cardiovascular fitness had improved. She felt full of stamina.</div><div class=\"western\">It was as though every aspect of her physical abilities had improved.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThis is amazing\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Strength gained through training accumulated slowly, so it was hard to perceive. However, she could clearly feel the intense augmentation of her physical capabilities. More surprising was the fact that she did not feel any awkwardness in controlling her body given the differences between her previous and present self.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cMagic really is amazing\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The Sorcerer King shrugged as he heard Neia react in awe.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThat\u2019s true. In fact, I\u2019ve been quite surprised by utility spells myself.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cBy that, do you mean\u2026?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cSpells which can create sugar and pepper and ice. Then there are spells which can even create ores, though they\u2019re not very mana-efficient. Some cities also depend on utility spells to supplement their water supply\u2026 It would seem utility spells are closely linked to the development of this world\u2019s culture.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIs\u2026 that so?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Why would a great magic caster like the Sorcerer King be surprised by such trivial spells? Still, it must make sense, given that the Sorcerer King had said it. And indeed, utility spells had come to be of great use in many places; daily life might not have been possible without such magic.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAlso, there are those sewers which use slimes\u2026 or rather, coexist with them\u2026 ah, I\u2019m straying from the point. Miss Baraja, pay me no heed and return to your work.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">In truth, there was no task more important than keeping the Sorcerer King company. However, it was also true that they lacked manpower, and Neia had a surprising number of things to do, While said tasks were largely related to standing guard, which anyone could do, they were still very important.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThank you very much, Your Majesty. I promise that I will return alive.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAh, if things get really bad, then flee to the east. In all likelihood, that\u2019s the only place where you might have a chance to survive.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Neia picked up Buser\u2019s armor and bowed before leaving the room.</div><div class=\"western\"></div><div class=\"western\">***</div><div class=\"western\"></div><div class=\"western\">Inside the operations room, Remedios Custodio and three paladins studied a force distribution chart.</div><div class=\"western\">Unlike how she would make people sigh in exasperation most of the time, her mind was nimble and perceptive when it came to warfare. While her younger sister would say, \u201cYou\u2019ve got a great body there, all you need now is to study a little more,\u201d she could not have gained her present fighting skill if she had heeded that advice.</div><div class=\"western\">That was because she was different from her sister, who had been blessed with three gifts \u2015 wisdom, talent, and beauty.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Our fighting strength is 10,000. Theirs is estimated at 40,000. Our win conditions are to hold on until reinforcements from the south arrive, or the enemy retreats\u2026 we might actually be able to do it if there were ten of me around\u2026</i></div><div class=\"western\">If the members of the Nine Colors who had been chosen for their fighting strength were present, they might have been able to put up a good fight, but the fact remained that the present situation was incredibly grim.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>If we want to buy time, we need to counterattack the enemy hard during their first offensive. That\u2019ll put the enemy on their guard and give us the time we need. After all, the enemy doesn\u2019t know what forces we possess, right?</i></div><div class=\"western\">She had also seriously considered the proposal of launching a first strike.</div><div class=\"western\">They could gather their forces at the east gate and crush the enemy there in one mighty blow before wheeling around to head for the west gate.</div><div class=\"western\">However, she had quickly reached a conclusion \u2015 all would be lost if they failed. It was very likely that the west gate would be lost to the enemy\u2019s main force before they defeated the small detachment positioned at the east gate, and thus the city would fall.</div><div class=\"western\">And of course, there was the disparity between their forces. They had to compensate for that gap if they wanted to win.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>But that\u2019s impossible.</i></div><div class=\"western\">Remedios wrinkled her brow and looked at the tokens placed on the map.</div><div class=\"western\">She hoped for a flash of inspiration to descend from on high. However, no such thing happened.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cDo you lot have any ideas?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYes. Personally speaking\u2015\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">She listened to the paladin\u2019s proposal, shot it down, then asked for more ideas, and the process repeated until none of them could come up with anything. Just then, a knock rang through the weighty silence of the room.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cCaptain, you\u2019re here.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The person who entered was the vice-captain \u2015 Gustav Montagnes. It felt like she had been saved by the bell. It would seem the other paladins in the room also felt that way, as a faint glimmer of hope appeared on their crestfallen faces.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAhh, you came just in time. I wanted to ask if you had any ideas.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios gestured to the map sprawled across the table with her chin. It would seem Gustav had gotten her meaning, because he nodded.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI can supply a suggestion or two, but can I discuss a few things with you beforehand?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHm? What is it? Go ahead and tell me.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAh\u2026\u201d Gustav continued in a more subdued tone. \u201cActually, things have gotten quite bad. Some of the people want to know if the Sorcerer King will be taking part in the fighting.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The Sorcerer King would not be fighting in this battle. This was both to recover the mana he had expended until now, and and to account for the case that Jaldabaoth\u2019s plan was to make him expend mana here.</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios had difficulty accepting the first reason, since her little sister Kelart could restore her mana within a day. However, everybody else felt that the Sorcerer King could not be held to the same standards as human beings, given that he had taken back the city single-handedly, and so Remedios said nothing more. Come to think of it, there had been priests present as well, and they too had agreed with him.</div><div class=\"western\">However, even Remedios could accept the second reason.</div><div class=\"western\">Who could tell if Jaldabaoth was hiding within the enemy ranks?</div><div class=\"western\">In the first place, they had brought the Sorcerer King here to fight Jaldabaoth. While it would be best if both of them ended up killing each other, she had no wish to see the Sorcerer King defeated. Therefore, it was only natural for her to work as closely as she could with the Sorcerer King so that he could fight to the fullest of his ability, even if she intensely despised the undead.</div><div class=\"western\">Even so, there had still been some who wanted the Sorcerer King to take the field. Some of the nobles who had remained in the city had offered huge sums of money \u2015 which had made even Remedios\u2019s eyes go so wide that they looked like they might fall out of her head \u2015 to induce him to fight, but the Sorcerer King had rejected their offers.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that? The Sorcerer King won\u2019t be fighting in this battle. You should know that too, right? Just tell them and be done with it.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cCaptain. We can\u2019t tell them about this. If things go badly \u2015 no, even if all goes well, it\u2019ll cause a huge uproar.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWhy is that?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">She could not understand it. What was wrong with the Sorcerer King not fighting?</div><div class=\"western\">After seeing the doubt written all over Remedios\u2019s face, Gustav frowned and replied:</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThat\u2019s because the people who watched us take back the city know that there are things which we paladins can\u2019t do, but which the Sorcerer King can accomplish with only two people.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">She still could not understand what Gustav was trying to say.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThat may upset some people, but that\u2019s how things are. What\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cNo, what I\u2019m trying to say is, they trust the Sorcerer King more than us paladins. If the people of this city learn that the Sorcerer King \u2015 the most reliable and powerful asset we have \u2015 is not fighting, morale will plunge to rock bottom.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cTrust? \u2026You do realize the Sorcerer King is undead, don\u2019t you?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter that he\u2019s undead. The Sorcerer King freed the city and rescued prisoners. So to them, the Sorcerer King is a hero.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cA hero?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios rolled her eyes as she repeated Gustav\u2019s words back to him.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThe people think he\u2019s a hero? But he\u2019s undead, no? They hate the living and love death. He abandoned the hostages \u2015 no, he killed them off without any hesitation, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIt\u2019s all the same to them. Also\u2026 it would be one thing if they simply regarded him as a hero. If this goes on, people will start thinking of the Sorcerer King as their savior. If things go wrong, it might affect the Holy King\u2019s\u2015\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThe Holy <i>Queen\u2019s</i>, you mean,\u201d Remedios\u2019s face twisted into a frown. \u201cI\u2019ve said this many times already, but Calca-sama must be locked up somewhere. There were paladins and priests collapsed everywhere after that battle with Jaldabaoth, but we couldn\u2019t find Calca-sama and Kelart anywhere. He wouldn\u2019t need to move her if she was dead. I\u2019m sure she must have been taken hostage.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI misspoke, Captain. I feel that it might be a problem that could cause problems for Her Majesty\u2019s reign.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHer reign?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYes. \u2026Our fortress line has been smashed and nobody can stop the demihumans from invading. There will start to be people who want to flock to the side of a supreme being who can protect them.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cBut he\u2019s undead\u2026 you know?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI say again, it doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s undead. He saved them in their hour of need, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios still could not understand that point.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cBut the Sorcerer King wasn\u2019t the only one fighting, was he? We fought too, under the Holy Queen\u2019s flag.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYes. You\u2019re right. We all fought, even the common folk. But even with all that taken into consideration, if the Sorcerer King does more than us, then there might be people who would value him over the Holy Queen and seek to make him their new ruler.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHah!?\u201d Remedios unconsciously raised her voice. \u201cHow did that happen? Not only is he a hero, that undead creature\u2019s being placed above the Holy Queen? Do you even know what you\u2019re saying?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cNo, the people\u2015\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2015It doesn\u2019t matter, he\u2019s still undead! How much suffering and effort do you think Her Majesty had to go through for the sake of the people? How could the people\u2015\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2015Please wait, Captain!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWhat do you mean, wait!? What the hell are you talking about, Gustav? No, is that what you truly believe?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">In the grip of her powerful emotions, Remedios slammed her fist down on the table. As someone who had entered the realm of heroes, that blow crushed the area of the table beneath it and gouged a chunk out, which fell to the ground. The bizarre damage pattern looked like some giant had pressed out the edge of the table, and it spoke of the extent of her anger.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cPlease calm down, Captain! We all know the greatness and kindness of Her Majesty as a matter of course. There\u2019s no way the Sorcerer King or any other undead creature could compare to the great Holy Queen. But we only know that because we stood by the Holy Queen\u2019s side.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAre you out of your mind? Even if they\u2019ve never had an audience with her before, there\u2019s no way anyone would respect the undead of another country more than the ruler of their own nation! You\u2019re delusional!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cCaptain!\u201d Gustav exclaimed, his voice close to a wail. \u201cEven if the Sorcerer King is undead and the king of another nation, he was still the one who freed them from torment! And that is something\u2026 something that Her Majesty, that <i>we</i>could not do!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Gustav spewed those words out in one big burst, and the room echoed with the sound of him trying to calm his flustered breathing.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026What do you all think?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The paladins who had previously been in the room all looked at each other as they heard Remedios\u2019s quiet voice. After that, one of them spoke up, a look of mortal determination on his face.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cNaturally, we paladins do not consider the Sorcerer King a hero. However, we also know that the common folk might feel that way.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">After that, another person spoke.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cMost of the people know that the Sorcerer King conquered this city with the strength of just two \u2015 no, one person. Those who have not seen the Sorcerer King\u2019s power in turn exaggerate these rumors, further deifying him.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The last one added:</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIt is a fact that the Sorcerer King stepped forward by himself to offer aid to a country which was neither an ally nor one that was friendly to him. If we disregard the fact that he is undead\u2026 those actions would qualify as heroic.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">It would seem Remedios was the only one who could not accept this state of affairs. In that case, how could she respond to Gustav\u2019s question after all this had sunk in?</div><div class=\"western\">It was true that not having their hero take part in the fighting would cause morale to drop, and thinking about the reasons for that would lead to a commotion. After all, the enemy outnumbered them four to one. Anyone would be in that frame of mind when they thought about having to fight something like that.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026Then why don\u2019t we paint the Sorcerer King as a villain and kill two birds with one stone? How about telling the masses that the Sorcerer King won\u2019t help us any more?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cLying would be a very bad idea,\u201d Gustav said. \u201cThe mood of the people is like a dam just before it bursts. If they learn the truth through one channel or another and discover that we were trying to hide the truth, the matter would spiral out of our control.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWell, we don\u2019t have to tell a flat-out lie. We can do it in a roundabout way.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIf the people think it\u2019s a lie, then they\u2019ll treat it as a lie.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThen all we need to do is keep them from seeing the Sorcerer King, no?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026So if a riot breaks out or if someone wants to plead with him in person, we\u2019ll kill them off?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Gustav sighed heavily.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThis is frustrating. The Sorcerer King showed too much of his strength. I feel we wouldn\u2019t be like this if we had taken this city back under our own power\u2026 If the worst comes to worst, the country itself might be torn apart. Who\u2019s going to stop the Sorcerer King if he declares this land an enclave of the Sorcerous Kingdom?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThis nation belongs to Her Majesty and the people who live upon it! Not to the undead! And besides, do you think the surrounding nations will accept that!?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios pounded on the table again. However, Gustav\u2019s face did not change, and he interjected:</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThey probably will. Captain, you saw them too, right\u2026 the monsters in his city. No other nation would want to become the enemy of the Sorcerous Kingdom, which possesses such frightening military power. It would be wiser to simply turn a blind eye to the Holy Kingdom, which is now impotent\u2026 and if this place becomes an enclave, the Sorcerous Kingdom\u2019s defensive strength will be divided between two fronts, and many of the nearby countries will agree that it is a good thing. And if the people wish for this to happen as well, the Sorcerer King will have just cause for his actions.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026So being a country of the undead is better than being a nation whose people can\u2019t even defend themselves\u2026 is that how it is, vice-captain?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Gustav nodded at the paladin\u2019s question. \u201cJust so.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cGustav. Did I make a mistake in bringing the Sorcerer King back here?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cOf course not, Captain. It was the best choice at the time. However\u2026 it is true that we\u2019ve relied too much on the Sorcerer King\u2019s power. Like I said earlier, if we had taken back those prison camps with our own strength, we wouldn\u2019t be in this situation now. For all we know, the people might still fear and hate the Sorcerer King, being that he\u2019s one of the undead.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026So what should we do?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWe need to appease the people, buy time, and defeat the enemy army by ourselves. If we can\u2019t even do that, then even if we defeat Jaldabaoth\u2026 the fighting might still continue.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios looked up to the ceiling.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026Then that\u2019s what we have to do. Damn that Sorcerer King\u2026 did he plan all this out beforehand?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 I really don\u2019t know. But he might have.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cMaybe he desires to expand his domain. Is the Sorcerous Kingdom very small?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s very small, but it\u2019s true that the Sorcerous Kingdom is only his city and the land around it, as well as that plain which is rumored to spawn large quantities of the undead.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">So that was why he had his eyes on the Holy Kingdom\u2019s land. There was certainly more than enough evidence to lead to that conclusion.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThat damn undead creature! We should have asked for Momon\u2019s strength after all!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cPerhaps things might have ended the same if Momon had come. The shock would simply not have been as great as the impact which the Sorcerer King made. A king conquering a city by himself is an incredibly striking image. The fact that said king is one of the undead who are our nation\u2019s sworn enemies is also a big factor in this.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">In other words, a villain doing a good thing had a greater impact than an average person doing the same thing.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026Damn it.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Now that silence had returned to the room, Remedios \u2015 who finally realised that Gustav was asking for her opinion \u2015 gave her orders.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWe\u2019ll discuss this with Caspond-sama. If, perhaps, though I feel it\u2019s not too likely, just in case, Her Majesty has passed away, then he is the most eligible person to be the next Holy King.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cSince we have not yet found any other members of the royal family, that will certainly be the case. We\u2019ll go ask his opinion of all this, then.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios left the paladins in the room and led Gustav to Caspond\u2019s room.</div><div class=\"western\"></div><div class=\"western\">In the end, things turned out just like Gustav had predicted. The conclusion was that they would delay in answering the people and if the enemy should attack during this time, they would face them without the assumption of the Sorcerer King\u2019s assistance and beat them back, thus showing the world that the strength of the Holy Kingdom was still undiminished.</div><div class=\"western\"></div><div class=\"western\"><b>Part 3</b></div><div class=\"western\"></div><div class=\"western\">There were large movements in the demihuman camp \u2015 upon receiving that report, Neia knew that the time had come.</div><div class=\"western\">There was no doubt about it; this was a prelude to an attack.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia ran through the city, wearing in the gear she had borrowed from the Sorcerer King.</div><div class=\"western\">She knew that the people she was running past were staring at her.</div><div class=\"western\">Their line of sight was drawn to the magnificent bow she had borrowed from the Sorcerer King, and then they looked at the armor previously worn by the ex-ruler of the city, the Grand King Buser, and they were filled with shock. Neia\u2019s acute hearing picked out people asking a question through the noise of the crowd: \u201cWho is that warrior?\u201d It was answered by \u201cIt\u2019s the Sorcerer King\u2019s squire\u201d or \u201cThe woman from the Sorcerous Kingdom.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\"><i>I\u2019m not from the Sorcerous Kingdom\u2026</i></div><div class=\"western\">It bothered her every time she heard false rumors like that. Part of her wanted to know, yet did not want to know how the rumors had wrongly depicted her. However, she would need to clearly and firmly deny any rumors which might inconvenience the Sorcerer King.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Still, the Sorcerer King\u2019s squire\u2026</i></div><div class=\"western\">It pleased her, but just as she was about to smile, a quiet groan came from one of the people she ran past.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Even if he does resemble Father\u2026</i></div><div class=\"western\">That thought passed through Neia\u2019s mind as she arrived at the wall adjoining the west gate, where she had been assigned. That was also where practically all of the demihuman forces were gathered.</div><div class=\"western\">Close to eighty percent of all the paladins, priests, soldiers and able-bodied men in the city had been stationed at the west gate or in its vicinity. The remaining twenty were assigned to the east gate, while the women, children, old folks, and other non-combatants were keeping watch from the north and south city walls.</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios Custodio commanded the west gate. Gustav Montagnes commanded the east gate. Caspond Bessarez was the nominal supreme commander. Of course, the supreme commander stayed within the headquarters in the center of the city and did not venture out.</div><div class=\"western\">She could see the west gate at last.</div><div class=\"western\">The Sorcerer King had demolished the east gate\u2019s portcullis, but the west gate\u2019s portcullis was still intact. However, many demihumans were stronger than human beings. They could probably wreck it easily with logs.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia clenched her hand into a fist before it could tremble.</div><div class=\"western\">If they broke through this point and made their way inside, it would be very difficult to deal with the demihumans once they began spreading through the city. In other words, the city would be lost.</div><div class=\"western\">Given the circumstances, Neia could not run. She would probably fight and die in combat against a vast swarm of demihumans.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia brought her trembling hand to her mouth, and then bit down.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Don\u2019t be afraid! If you\u2019re scared, you\u2019ll miss a target you could have hit!</i></div><div class=\"western\">The magic item she borrowed from the Sorcerer King could defend against magical mental attacks, but it could not suppress the fear born of her own heart. Even so, she would probably have been even more frightened if she had not worn it.</div><div class=\"western\">As she felt the pain spreading from her fingers, Neia entered a tower on what seemed to be the left side of the city and ran up the stairs to the top of the wall.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia had been assigned to the Sorcerer King\u2019s side, and so she was apparently the last to show up \u2015 of course, her superior officers had granted her special dispensation so she would not be censured for being late \u2015 and the other people who were supposed to be here were already present.</div><div class=\"western\">As Neia prepared to rush off to her station, the paladin commanding the left flank of the western wall stopped her.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThe Sorcerer King \u2015 His Majesty seems to be missing.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">For a moment, Neia looked at the paladin in surprise. She had already reported to her superiors that the Sorcerer King had no intention of taking part in this battle, but they were still asking her this question. Did that mean they had not yet informed the others about it?</div><div class=\"western\">However, Neia immediately sensed that this was not the case. This man was holding on to a sliver of hope \u2015 he was wondering if the Sorcerer King would change his mind and show up.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia looked upon the demihuman army that was sprawled outside the city. There were well over 30,000 demihumans there, but the pressure of looking directly at them made them feel more numerous than they actually were.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia could understand why anyone would wish for the aid of the overwhelmingly powerful Sorcerer King in the face of such a force. That was because Neia had once felt the same way too. However\u2015</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYes. The Sorcerer King is not here. That\u2019s because this is our \u2015 the Holy Kingdom\u2019s battle.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The paladin was speechless for a moment.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia slipped past him and ran to her post\u2015</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2015Hold on! Squire Neia Baraja!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYes!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Neia stopped and stood at attention.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cStand by here for the time being.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cEh!?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Neia looked around. This place was close to the exit of the tower which led to the top of the city wall. A lot of people would be moving through this place. Would she not be getting in everyone\u2019s way if she stood here? In addition, this place was far from Neia\u2019s assigned position, which was close to the center.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cMay, may I ask the reason for this? Is there something you need me to do?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s not like we need you to do anything, it\u2019s actually a little troublesome. \u2026Squire Baraja. Just stay put here. Do you understand!?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAh, yes\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">She had no idea what was going on, but there must have been some reason for it. There was no reason to keep a trained soldier here for no reason when the fighting might break out at any moment.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Was my assignment changed? Is it so that I can focus on sniping the enemy commanders? \u2026The bow I borrowed from the Sorcerer King looks amazing even at a glance, so does that mean they\u2019re using me as a trump card?</i></div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI understand. How long will I be waiting? Also, where shall I wait?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAh, um, well, just until the enemy moves in. As for where, anywhere is fine.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHuh? I need to wait right until the last moment?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">It was indeed weird. Just as a sense of wrongness began to fill Neia, several men who looked like they had come from the militia carried a huge pot up the stairs. This was probably food for the defenders standing by on the walls. They were sweating far more than the cold weather warranted, and it was clear that these men had come back and forth many times. It was only to be expected, given that they were feeding several hundred men.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia leaned against the wall to give them room to pass, and the men moved hurriedly past her. However, one of them lifted their head a little and noticed Neia\u2019s face.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHuh? Aren\u2019t you the Sorcerer King\u2019s squire \u2015 ah, no, would that be you, ma\u2019am?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAh, no need to be so formal\u2026 er, forgive me. Yes. I have been assigned the duty of serving as the Sorcerer King\u2019s squire.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Perhaps they had heard Neia speak with the man, but the other pot-bearers stopped and looked at Neia in surprise. It was probably for the same reason as the man from just now.</div><div class=\"western\">She was slightly embarrassed to be known as the Sorcerer King\u2019s squire, but at the same time she felt very proud of herself.</div><div class=\"western\">The men did not know how Neia felt, and they worriedly asked, \u201cI say, ah, actually, there\u2019s something I\u2019d like to ask the Sorcerer King\u2015\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2015Stop that! No, could I please ask you to save it for later? She\u2019s very busy. Would you mind carrying on with your work?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Suddenly, the paladin stepped between Neia and the men, as though to hide her.</div><div class=\"western\">That was a strange thing to do. It looked as though he did not want her to speak with those men\u2015</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Was that the reason for the order just now? He doesn\u2019t want me to talk to them\u2026 why is that? Is it because they were going to ask a question about the Sorcerer King?</i></div><div class=\"western\">She did not know why he was doing this, but finding the answer would be simple enough.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI don\u2019t mind. What seems to be the problem?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Since the paladin did not want her to speak, then she would just have to address them directly.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cSquire Baraja!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAre you trying to keep people from asking about the Sorcerer King!?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Neia answered as loudly as the shout which had been directed at her.</div><div class=\"western\">In truth, it was quite shameless to keep borrowing the Sorcerer King\u2019s reputation like this, but she had to make sure the Holy Kingdom was not doing anything which might negatively impact the Sorcerer King. She did not want her home country to disgrace itself.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia gently addressed the man who had asked her the question earlier. Of course, she knew that it was probably going to frighten him, even if she felt her tone was gentle.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI will answer to the best of my ability if your question is related to the great Sorcerer King. That said, I am not of the Sorcerous Kingdom, so I regret to say there are many things I do not know either.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cEh!? But you \u2015 aren\u2019t you from the Sorcerous Kingdom, ma\u2019am?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cEh!? No, no, it\u2019s not like that. I\u2019m a squire from the paladins of this country.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cEh? Really?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWell, yes? So you don\u2019t need to be all formal with me\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The crowd burst into a commotion. Perhaps it was because the paladin had shouted at her just now, but at some point the militiamen on the walls had started looking her way.</div><div class=\"western\">While matters had taken quite an embarrassing turn, she could not look let herself look bad now that she had invoked the name of the Sorcerer King. Neia puffed up her chest proudly, determined to let all the soldiers present hear her. It would seem the paladin had resigned himself to the fact that he could not hide this, and so he stood to one side while glaring angrily at Neia.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThen, first off\u2026 That armor of yours looked like something that the boss of those goat-headed monsters wore. Were you the one who defeated it?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cNo, not at all. The previous wearer of this armor was the Grand King Buser, and the Sorcerer King slaughtered him with a single spell.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Ohhh</i>, the crowd enthused.</div><div class=\"western\">She could hear snatches of conversation from the crowd: \u201cHe actually beat that monster!\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t believe he used only one spell,\u201d \u201cDid he really take down a whole city by himself\u2026 he actually defeated so many demihumans\u2026\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s super strong\u2026 I think I\u2019m falling for him\u2026\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s not like the undead I know at all\u2026\u201d and so on.</div><div class=\"western\">Even though they were whispering into each others\u2019 ears or muttering to themselves, Neia\u2019s keen ears could clearly hear them.</div><div class=\"western\">Of course, it made her very happy to know that others felt the same way about the great man she so admired. This was particularly true for those people who maintained that opinion despite knowing that he was undead.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>His Majesty\u2019s efforts were not in vain, there are people out there who get it\u2026</i></div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThen, then, ah, will His Majesty be lending us a helping hand this time round?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The ruckus fell silent in an instant, and that reaction told Neia that this question was a critical one.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026His Majesty will not be taking part in this battle. This is because it is a battle that we, as citizens of the Holy Kingdom, are fighting to save our nation, and not another country\u2019s war. In addition, His Majesty needs to conserve mana for when he faces Jaldabaoth.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The men\u2019s faces fell as they heard her reply. Neia prepared herself for a rebuke\u2015</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWell, that makes sense\u2026 normally, the king of another country wouldn\u2019t come over by himself. Heaven will punish us if we\u2019re not grateful to him despite all he\u2019s done for us.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYeah. Also, she said that he\u2019s saving up his mana to defeat Jaldabaoth.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026That king is very cool-headed, but even so he\u2019s a man who\u2019ll choose a method that saves more people\u2026 no, he\u2019s undead. In that case, there must be a reason why he won\u2019t take part in this battle. I mean, I saw it back then.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAhh, I saw it too. It\u2019s true that we\u2019re the ones who value this country the most. \u2015I\u2019ll protect my wife!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWe came from the prison camps before this city was liberated\u2015\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">She could hear voices of goodwill from all around her.</div><div class=\"western\">Of course, there were some who were unhappy that the Sorcerer King was not coming to help. However, they were outnumbered by the people who could understand the Sorcerer King\u2019s considerations, and it warmed her heart.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cMay I return to my post now?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Neia addressed her question to the paladin. She now understood why he did not want her to go to her post earlier. In that case, there ought to be no problems in letting her head there now.</div><div class=\"western\">The paladin did not hide how he felt as he told Neia to \u201cGo,\u201d with a bitter look on his face.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia walked past the soldiers who were loudly discussing the Sorcerer King and arrived at the place she had been assigned to. She then intently studied the enemy encampment.</div><div class=\"western\">It was a vast army. It boasted enough manpower to devour everyone here in one gulp. It was the enemy which would be attacking them.</div><div class=\"western\">She felt like she was going to throw up again.</div><div class=\"western\">How many times had her father felt like this when he was manning the fortress line?</div><div class=\"western\">Neia looked up at the sky, which was as overcast as her heart.</div><div class=\"western\"></div><div class=\"western\">***</div><div class=\"western\"></div><div class=\"western\">The demihuman army made their move during the day.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia hurried to finish up her porridge.</div><div class=\"western\">Said porridge was made of oat grains boiled with milk and served in a wooden bowl. Thanks to the winter air outside, it was cold by the time it reached Neia\u2019s hands and, frankly speaking, it was awful. However, if she did not eat her body would not be able to endure the extended exertion it would have to go through afterwards, and there would be no more food waiting for her. In addition, while there was supposed to be a relief shift for her, Neia had the feeling that she would not be successfully relieved, and that she would be too busy for a proper meal later on. That was why they had been given such a large portion for lunch</div><div class=\"western\">She forced the spoon into her mouth, forcing herself to swallow the thick, white clumps of oatmeal that were swollen with milk.</div><div class=\"western\">The sheer amount she had to swallow bloated her belly, and the knowledge that this horrible stuff might be her last meal filled her with despair.</div><div class=\"western\">At the battlements overlooking the demihuman army, Neia curled herself up on a cotton mat. Her grey-colored coat would be her only defense against the winter cold from now on. The militiamen had started eating at the same time as her but they had not yet finished.</div><div class=\"western\">Everyone was frowning. Clearly nobody was happy with the taste. That could not be helped.</div><div class=\"western\">However, their tense expressions were not due to the oatmeal porridge. Their eyes were not looking at the food in their hands, but the demihumans making their advance.</div><div class=\"western\">There was no way anyone could be happy \u2015 or hopeful \u2015 when looking upon those overwhelming numbers.</div><div class=\"western\">Then there were those who had once been prisoners. Their taste of demihuman rule had engraved an intense fear into them. They were under so much stress that they were unable to eat.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>What would the Sorcerer King do under these circumstances?</i></div><div class=\"western\">Would he give a grand, spirited speech to heighten their will to fight? Or would he laugh it off?</div><div class=\"western\">Neia had no idea what heroic actions he would take. Still, even if she knew, she could not emulate him. After all, she was completely different from the Sorcerer King, who was both a hero and a king.</div><div class=\"western\">Also, it would probably cause problems if Neia said something like \u201crelax and don\u2019t worry\u201d to them. After all, appropriate tension was what drove things forward.</div><div class=\"western\">Their faces might have been downcast, but there was no sign that they had given in to despair, nor were there any signs that they wanted to flee. There was something about them, something that one could only find in soldiers who had prepared themselves to meet their fate.</div><div class=\"western\">The reason for that was apparently due to something that one of the militiamen \u2015 who had been one of the first to be freed from the prison camps \u2015 had said about the Sorcerer King. It spread through the soldiers stationed at the walls like wildfire.</div><div class=\"western\">Lives were not equally important.</div><div class=\"western\">They were unhappy when they heard he had killed a hostage whom the demihumans were holding. It was a ruthless act that was very characteristic of the undead. However, the people who had been there strenuously insisted that it was not the case. They spoke of how that incomparably powerful Sorcerer King had said, \u201cEven I would become the victim in the face of someone stronger than me.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Neia remembered those words too. Back then, he had seemed extremely human, even radiating a tragic stoicism which felt like determination and resolve personified. It was a powerful promise to protect those things which were important to him and it had a persuasive power to it which could not be put into words.</div><div class=\"western\">And then, they thought about what would happen to the people dear to them if they were defeated here.</div><div class=\"western\">Their fighting spirit was strengthened by a powerful sense of purpose, which said \u201cI don\u2019t want to let my loved ones go through hell again.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Had His Majesty considered that things might end up like this all that time ago?</i></div><div class=\"western\">If he had not said those words to stiffen the people\u2019s resolve, their forces might have lost their morale in the face of the overwhelming army before them, and they might even have dissolved into a rout.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia had only seen the Holy Queen once. She had almost no idea of her abilities or her character. Still, she was certain the Sorcerer King was superior to her as a ruler in both aspects. Or rather, the Sorcerer King was probably the sort of sovereign who was known as the King of Kings, the highest order of monarch, even among other kings.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAnd here I used to feel that the people of the Sorcerous Kingdom were pitiful because they were ruled by the undead\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">However, they might have been very lucky now that she thought about it. Those words caught in Neia\u2019s throat, did a loop and refused to leave her mouth. After all, it would not be good if the people around her heard them. Just then\u2015</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cConfirmed enemy advance! All hands prepare for battle!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">A great shout came from the distance.</div><div class=\"western\">Everyone gulped down their porridge and went to battle stations.</div><div class=\"western\">If an army which was over 10,000 strong made its move, the air would shudder, to the point where it might even shake the walls of the city. It felt like the oncoming pressure would squash them flat.</div><div class=\"western\">In fact, Neia\u2019s acute hearing had picked up the earthshaking clamor of an advancing army, and despondent wails rose up from the militiamen.</div><div class=\"western\">Morale was falling fast.</div><div class=\"western\">Still, there was nothing Neia could do, and she was not in a position to do anything either. Neia\u2019s job was to fill every enemies who entered her range with arrows.</div><div class=\"western\">Ever since this city had been taken back, she had spent every waking moment practicing her archery when she had not been performing her duties as a squire. She mused that it was thanks to that practice that she had gotten used to Ultimate Shootingstar Super, and she was now able to use it properly.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Still, why are the demihumans attacking now? Attacking at night would be better for them\u2026 do they have something in mind? If the Sorcerer King were here, I could ask him about this\u2026</i></div><div class=\"western\">The absence of the magic caster who had walked beside or in front of her for the past month made her feel like there was something important missing from her heart.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>No. I can\u2019t rely on His Majesty for everything. I need to stand on my own two feet\u2026 Although I\u2019m not sure exactly what the demihumans are planning, there ought to be a reason for launching their attack in broad daylight. In that case, it would be best not to be careless.</i></div><div class=\"western\">As Neia observed the demihumans from the battlements, the frontline of demihumans drew her attention.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>\u2026Hey, that\u2019s\u2026</i></div><div class=\"western\">There was an Ogre standing three meters tall in the front rank. That demihuman carried a massive weapon.</div><div class=\"western\">It was some kind of ranged weapon that was protected by a wooden shield. It was a ballista. Although it seemed just right for the demihuman due to the latter\u2019s massive size, the fact was that they could be used as siege weapons.</div><div class=\"western\">Many Ogres carried these weapons, which ought to have been mounted in place, and they stood in a row.</div><div class=\"western\">Had they scavenged them from a city and remodelled them for upright shooting?</div><div class=\"western\">The drums thundered, and the ballistas were prepared to fire.</div><div class=\"western\">And then\u2015</div><div class=\"western\">\u2015The city walls literally began to shake. The battlements collapsed in some places. While they would have to have been lucky not to take any casualties given the circumstances, luck was with them for now.</div><div class=\"western\">A gigantic arrow shattered the battlements. It was not so much an arrow as a javelin. A thick javelin that was longer than Neia was tall raced through the air and embedded itself in the walls. At this point, the only word for it was \u201csiege weapon.\u201d Surely nobody could take a hit from it and survive.</div><div class=\"western\">The Ogres looked like they were preparing for a second volley.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYou bastards!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Neia stared at them.</div><div class=\"western\">The Ogres were far, far away.</div><div class=\"western\">Given the power of her bow, she could probably hit them at that range. However, its penetration ability would be greatly diminished, and the fact was that she could not practice long-range shooting like this within the city limits. She did not know the range to them, and she was not confident that she could shoot through the ballistas\u2019 shields and kill their wielders.</div><div class=\"western\">That being the case, all they could do was open the gates and fight a pitched battle to kill the ballista team, but that would be an extremely foolish move.</div><div class=\"western\">In other words, all they could do was keep on taking this one-sided attack.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>We have to pull back\u2026 but if we do, we can\u2019t stop the enemy advance. What kind of plan does the brass have?</i></div><div class=\"western\">Although the enemy was only shooting so far, they would move to take the walls if the men retreated, and if the enemy seized the walls, then the city was all but lost.</div><div class=\"western\">They would take control of the stairs leading down from the walls and force the soldiers around it back to open the gates in order to let the main body of their forces into the city. All they needed to do was force that sequence of events through by dint of sheer power. There was nothing they could do about it. Even Remedios would have a hard time being surrounded by enemies in a melee.</div><div class=\"western\">In that case, all they could do was sacrifice their rear guard and flee the city from the east. However, that would probably lead to the situation they had discussed in a previous strategy meeting \u2015 they would be harried along the plains, or they would be crushed between this army and the one arrayed against the south.</div><div class=\"western\">What would the paladin commanding the west gate decide?</div><div class=\"western\">Would he fall back, or would he fight to the end?</div><div class=\"western\">As Neia contemplated the matter, a second volley came from the enemy.</div><div class=\"western\">The walls shook again as the lance-sized projectiles struck it. The trembling felt more intense than the last time, and at the same time she heard an unrecognizable sound.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAbbbahhhhh!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">She looked at the source of the sound and witnessed a horrific sight.</div><div class=\"western\">One of the ballista bolts had shot clean through a wall and impaled a militiaman hiding behind it. Blood bubbled out of his mouth. Several seconds later, the man\u2019s twitching stopped and he collapsed like a puppet whose strings had been cut. The bolt had nailed him to the wall like an insect specimen, and his arms and legs dangled limply downwards.</div><div class=\"western\">Screams broke out from around her as the men saw the hideous corpse which had suddenly appeared among them.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia grabbed the necklace which the Sorcerer King had lent her, and bit her lip.</div><div class=\"western\">That was a fatal wound. No amount of healing magic could cure that.</div><div class=\"western\">The death of one soldier did not greatly affect their fighting strength. However, the fear generated by his gruesome death infected the surroundings. The thought that they might be next and that there was nowhere safe for them triggered the survival instincts of the men, and their bodies trembled.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u300cUnder Divine Flag\u300d!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Someone cast a spell.</div><div class=\"western\">The terror coursing through the militiamen was suppressed in that moment. This was the result of using magic to improve their resistance to fear. While the divine spell \u300cLion\u2019s Heart\u300d provided complete immunity to fear, it was only effective on a single target. In contrast, \u300cUnder Divine Flag\u300d affected everyone in a sphere around the caster.</div><div class=\"western\">That was why the paladins stood among the militiamen.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid!\u201d The paladin who had cast the spell shouted, \u201cTake up your weapons to save those who have gone through the same pain as you!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Spells and certain special abilities could briefly panic people, but the fear they felt now came from their own hearts. Under the effects of the fear-suppressing spell, the fire blazed anew in the militiamen\u2019s eyes.</div><div class=\"western\">Still, that was simply covering up the actual problem. The important thing was whether they could do anything about the one-sided attack they were taking from the enemy. Otherwise, the only thing that would come of it would be more dead and wounded. However, Neia could not come up with any good ideas.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cTake cover! The enemy doesn\u2019t have unlimited ammunition! They couldn\u2019t have brought so much with them!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\"><i>I see,</i> Neia thought. Most of their resources ought to be going to the south in order to provision the army standing off against the southern forces, so was that why they thought that they would not have brought enough ammunition for their weapons here? Still, even a captive craftsman could make a lot of those bolts in a short time, although the crossbows were a different matter. This was a gamble.</div><div class=\"western\">\u2015The third wave came.</div><div class=\"western\">The ogres were not used to archery, and many of them missed their shots. Even so, many of the battlements crumbled under the third volley, and there were many casualties among the militiamen.</div><div class=\"western\">The massive, lance-like bolts could pierce a man and the man behind him as well.</div><div class=\"western\">\u300cUnder Divine Flag\u300dwas a spell that was centered on the paladin who had cast it, which meant that its effect were strongest when many people were bunched up within its effective radius. However, that only led to more casualties.</div><div class=\"western\">The sound of flapping came through the air before the enemy could fire a fourth time. Winged angels flew through the sky and passed over the heads of Neia and the others.</div><div class=\"western\">While they were angels of the lowest order, they headed straight for the demihumans. They had burning brands in their right hands and they held pitchers with cloth sticking out of their mouths in their left hands. Those pitchers clearly contained oil or powerful spirits.</div><div class=\"western\">In other words, they were carrying explosive throwing weapons \u2015 firebombs.</div><div class=\"western\">Of course, the flames produced by those weapons would not harm fire-resistant opponents in the slightest, or demihumans with thick hides or large bodies. They might not even have an effect at all.</div><div class=\"western\">On the other hand, there were also those demihumans who could not deal with fire, and damaging the ballistas would also stop the enemy attack.</div><div class=\"western\">The angels filled the sky above the ballista-wielding Ogres and lit their pitchers. However, they did not even have the time to cast them down.</div><div class=\"western\">There was a flapping sound as demihumans took to the sky. They were Pteropuses. Their hands were shaped into leathery wings, and their arms remained still as they rose straight into the air like they were riding the wind. That was probably the effect of some kind of spell.</div><div class=\"western\">A white weblike substance flew out at the same time, entangling the angels. It had probably been produced by a special ability of the Spidans.</div><div class=\"western\">The angels looked like butterflies caught in a spiderweb, and they plunged to the ground since they were unable to move freely. They were swallowed up by the demihuman hordes, and it was needless to say what happened to them after that.</div><div class=\"western\">However, the angels had not sacrificed themselves in vain.</div><div class=\"western\">Several firebombs hit the ground, and roaring flames splashed all around.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia judged that this was the best chance she would get, and tensed her bowstring.</div><div class=\"western\">Until now, it had been impossible to aim directly at the Ogres due to the shields mounted on their ballistas. Even if she took aim at their unshielded legs instead, it would be nearly impossible to kill them in one hit.</div><div class=\"western\">Her father would have been able to shoot out an Ogre\u2019s eye through a tiny opening. However, Neia\u2019s skills were not as honed as his. However, the Ogres raised their ballistas and pointed their shields upwards. Perhaps it was because they feared the flames or they were afraid for their ballistas, but whatever the reason, their attention was focused on the fire, and they did not pay her any attention.</div><div class=\"western\">If she missed this chance, she would probably not get another.</div><div class=\"western\">She drew her bowstring to its limit, and then loosed her arrow.</div><div class=\"western\">The magic item she had borrowed from the Sorcerer King aided Neia in bringing forth a result that approached what her father could do.</div><div class=\"western\">The arrow flew on a startlingly straight path, and struck an Ogre\u2019s head.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia had not aimed for the thick skull, but a squishy eyeball. While some monsters possessed a protective membrane over their eyes, she judged that it would be easier to strike a fatal blow there rather than targeting the skull.</div><div class=\"western\">However \u2015 things did not go as planned.</div><div class=\"western\">Her arrow sank into the vicinity of the Ogre\u2019s jaw.</div><div class=\"western\">The stricken Ogre howled loudly, shuddering from the pain.</div><div class=\"western\">The Ogre dropped its ballista, and it clutched its face \u2015 the part where it had been shot. Then, it shakily turned its back on Neia before falling back. While she had not dealt it a mortal blow, she had at least broken its will to fight.</div><div class=\"western\">If the demihuman army had healers, it would probably be able to return to the frontlines in no time.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cTch!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">This was all Neia could accomplish, even with the aid of the powerful magic items the Sorcerer King had lent her.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia clicked her tongue and immediately took cover behind the battlements, then pressed herself to the city side of the wall and began to move. The militiamen beside her stared in surprise as she suddenly left her post, and she addressed them in harsh tones.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2015Get out of here! They\u2019re going to counterattack this place!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">It was not because they had heard Neia\u2019s shout, but several of the ballistas discharged their projectiles in her direction. While most of the bolts had gone awry, some of them landed in Neia\u2019s vicinity, and they wrecked the nearby wall.</div><div class=\"western\">If Neia had been unlucky, she might well have been impaled by those bolts.</div><div class=\"western\">She peeked at the demihumans again. The chaos from the angels and fire attack was being steadily contained, and the Ogres raised their ballistas again. It would seem news of being hit by an arrow had spread throughout the enemy army. In that case, they would probably not make the mistake of lowering their shields again. Therefore \u2015 would she gamble on being able to emulate her father\u2019s skill by a stroke of luck, hitting them even if she could only strike their exposed bodies? Or would she shrink up like a turtle and wait for her chance?</div><div class=\"western\">Amidst her confusion, the bow she had borrowed from the Sorcerer King caught the sun\u2019s light and gleamed beautifully.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>You won\u2019t be praised for rashness.</i>..</div><div class=\"western\">Yes. She had managed to borrow such incredibly potent items, and she had to return them no matter the cost. Therefore, she ought not to take risks.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>They can\u2019t have that many special bolts!</i></div><div class=\"western\">It would seem the demihumans were volleying an endless hail of lance-sized bolts at them. However, their crude manufacture meant that very often, they flew towards places with nothing to hit, and some of them even fell into the city streets without striking anything.</div><div class=\"western\">She could not return fire, so all she could do was hunker down and wait for the enemy attack to stop.</div><div class=\"western\">Fragments of the destroyed city walls showered Neia. Some unlucky militiamen were hit and died on the spot, but while others silently prayed for the enemy attack to stop, since they could not do anything else.</div><div class=\"western\">Soon, she heard a mighty <i>doom</i>, the beat of a drum. The same sound repeated itself four times. In the distance, the same sound came from what should have been the left wing of the enemy\u2019s formation.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>\u2026They\u2019re coordinating their movements with the number of drumbeats. It looks like the right and left wings are using that to communicate. If I could enter the enemy camp and steal one of those drums, then beat wildly on it, that ought to disrupt the enemy\u2019s cohesion \u2015 that said, it would be impossible.</i></div><div class=\"western\">The enemy ought to know the importance of their drums. Therefore, they would be heavily guarded. In that case, who could charge into their camp?</div><div class=\"western\">Perhaps an adventurer could use \u300cInvisibility\u300d or \u300cSilence\u300d or other spells to cause chaos among the enemy and then sneak in.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>There\u2019s no point hoping for the impossible\u2026</i></div><div class=\"western\">Still, there was no doubt that the enemy was changing tack. Neia \u2015 and many militiamen \u2015 nervously rose up to peek at the enemy\u2019s movements.</div><div class=\"western\">After that a great commotion rose up from them.</div><div class=\"western\">It was a feeling which combined shock, fear, and furious anger.</div><div class=\"western\">The army arrayed on the other side of the wall was advancing at last. The left and right wings of the Demihuman Alliance forces moved forward in parallel. The center detachment approached the city gate in a layered formation.</div><div class=\"western\">The demihumans advanced with earthshaking steps, as though they wanted to hunt down and kill Neia and the others.</div><div class=\"western\">And then there was another unit \u2015 a very small one \u2015 which seemed to be flanking the city. Were they planning to scale the walls, or was this a feint?</div><div class=\"western\">In any case, the enemy had already launched the second wave of their attack. From now on, it would not be a one-sided struggle, but a mutual struggle of savage bloodshed.</div><div class=\"western\">However, that was not where the problem lay. After all, they had been waiting a long time for this, though they could not take joy in the fact that the time had come at last.</div><div class=\"western\">What angered the militiamen was the advance of the left and right wings. Their foremost units were composed of many different species. While they lacked a sense of unity, they had two things in common.</div><div class=\"western\">One was that they were all carrying assault ladders.</div><div class=\"western\">In other words, their unit was meant to scale the walls and break into the city. That also implied that they were Neia\u2019s objective.</div><div class=\"western\">The other thing was that they had human children bound to their bodies.</div><div class=\"western\">Some of them were crying and wailing, while others hung limp. All of them were naked, and all of them were alive.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia bit her lip hard.</div><div class=\"western\">But at the same time, Neia\u2019s heart was surprisingly calm.</div><div class=\"western\">From her darkened nook in the walls, she watched the demihuman tide pressing down on them. Neia then slid an arrow out of her quiver and began to draw her bow.</div><div class=\"western\">Even if the enemy pioneers had entered her shooting range, she had to hold on.</div><div class=\"western\">It was still too early.</div><div class=\"western\">She took several deep breaths, focused herself, then turned as fast as she could and drew her bowstring taut.</div><div class=\"western\">She had only a moment to aim, and there was only one point where she could aim.</div><div class=\"western\">\u2015<i>Here!</i></div><div class=\"western\">She released her arrow.</div><div class=\"western\">Her unhesitating shot pierced the human shield \u2015 the chest of a child \u2015 and the demihuman behind it.</div><div class=\"western\">Perhaps even that powerful shot would have been hard-pressed to bring down something with the toughness of an Ogre. However, the demihuman she had just hit did not seem to possess such unreasonable vitality.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia paid no heed to the demihuman she had downed and drew another arrow.</div><div class=\"western\">She had killed a person, the child bound in front of the demihuman.</div><div class=\"western\">Her hands would not stop shaking. Her vision turned black, and her heart trembled.</div><div class=\"western\">Though she knew this would happen and had prepared herself for it, this was how she had reacted.</div><div class=\"western\">She reached for the hilt of her sword by force of habit, but her fingers touched the bowstring instead.</div><div class=\"western\">It was as though her bow was chiding her, telling her that now was not the time for that sort of thing.</div><div class=\"western\">A faint lamp lighted up in Neia\u2019s frozen heart. It spread like wildfire, and dispersed the chill winds blowing through her soul.</div><div class=\"western\">She stopped shaking, and her vision no longer felt narrowed. What filled her heart were the words of the person who embodied an unshakable justice.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Ahh, to think it would have such a great effect.</i></div><div class=\"western\">Neia reconfirmed that what the Sorcerer King said had been correct.</div><div class=\"western\">The demihuman pioneers that Neia had attacked were visibly slowing down. That was because they had been shaken to discover that their human shields were not effective.</div><div class=\"western\">Therefore, she shouted.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia opened her eyes, and shouted at the staring militiamen.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWhat are you doing? Hurry up and throw your stones down! We can\u2019t save those hostages!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">indeed. Neia and the others could not save the hostages. And then, they had already seen what the enemy would do to hostages that had lost their value. Therefore, what could they do?</div><div class=\"western\">She fired another arrow to speed the demihumans on their way to the afterlife.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia used her practiced vision and saw that her shot had pierced a boy through his forehead. She did not know if it was because she had been aiming for an Armatt or because the boy\u2019s skull had lessened the impact, but this arrow had not been immediately fatal. However, the enemy\u2019s front line was in chaos. That was only to be expected. Both humans and demihumans would slow their pace when things did not proceed as planned.</div><div class=\"western\">However, all she could see of the enemy lines stretched from one edge of her vision to the other.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia had only had an effect on the region where she had shot. Everywhere else, things were continuing as though nothing had happened. It looked like a small dent in a long, long line.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHurry up and throw the stones!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Neia shouted at them again.</div><div class=\"western\">If they did not throw their stones, everything Neia had done would have been for nothing. That was something even more unforgivable than taking the lives of people \u2015 children who had futures ahead of them.</div><div class=\"western\">The enemy was attacking on the left, right, and center at the same time. A head-on clash with an enemy that outnumbered them several times to one result in them being crushed under the sheer weight of numbers. However, if even one of the enemy elements slowed down, it would relieve the pressure on them.</div><div class=\"western\">If the enemy reached the walls, they would climb up while using the children as shields. If they managed to make it up the walls, the militiamen would not be able to resist the demihumans. What she had to do now was see how much fighting strength she could shave off the enemy before they arrived.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>It\u2019s very difficult for militiamen to kill children. Therefore, there has to be someone who\u2019s willing to set an example, even if they get their hands dirty!</i></div><div class=\"western\">Neia fixed her eyes on a paladin in the distance.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>You should have realized that when you took the prison camps and this city! You ought to have known that the Sorcerer King was right! You ought to know that you can\u2019t do anything else! And you certainly ought to know that it\u2019s pointless to obsess over lives you can\u2019t save! What you should be doing is devoting all your strength to save the people you can save!</i></div><div class=\"western\">Neia fired another arrow.</div><div class=\"western\">Just like before, her shot killed a girl and the demihuman to which she had been tied.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHurry\u2015\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2015Uooooohhhh!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">A shout echoed all around Neia as a stone flew. It seemed to sweep away the anxiety in her heart.</div><div class=\"western\">The thrown stone hit the demihumans, who were still hesitating. While it was a long way from being fatal, it would seem that it had done some damage.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHey, you guys! Hurry up and attack the demihumans! Give up on the kids they\u2019re holding hostage!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Neia recognized the militiaman who was shouting.</div><div class=\"western\">He was the father of the boy that the Sorcerer King had killed when they had liberated the first prison camp.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia was surprised to find him here.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIf they get past us, the women and children will suffer worse than they did before we saved them! If you still love your children, then throw those rocks as hard as you can!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">His voice seemed to banish all their doubts, and it was shortly followed by a volley of several rocks. While they flew on weird paths and there was no telling where they were aimed at, the fact was that they had been hurled out.</div><div class=\"western\">By the time Neia drew her bow again, a hail of stones descended on the demihumans. Many of those stones hit the front-running demihumans, the ones using children as meatshields. Rather, it would be more accurate to say that they hit the children tied to those demihumans, than the demihumans themselves.</div><div class=\"western\">The children cried and wailed in a heart-rending way. Even so, the rocks smashed mercilessly down on those pitiful children. They were the most tragic sacrifice of all, caught between the savagery of both sides.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia prioritized aiming for those children.</div><div class=\"western\">She did that to liberate them from their pain and torment as soon as possible.</div><div class=\"western\">This was a sign of respect for the few which had to be sacrificed to help the many.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia leaned out to find her next target, and then she felt something tearing through the air as it approached her, but all she saw was a burst of light.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Is this an enemy magic attack ?</i></div><div class=\"western\">Neia froze for a moment. At the same time, she felt a gentle impact from her belly. It felt like something had struck her lightly there.</div><div class=\"western\">Startled, she stumbled a step back and then she heard a clattering from her feet. She looked closely and saw something that looked less like a lance than a gigantic arrow \u2015 in other words, a ballista bolt.</div><div class=\"western\">Its tip looked like it had been hammered into a right angle by a hammer.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia hurriedly ducked back behind the wall. After that, she heard a scraping sound as something huge struck the city walls.</div><div class=\"western\">Cold sweat ran down her back.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia unconsciously stroked the part of her where she had felt the impact.</div><div class=\"western\">She thought of how the Sorcerer King had thrown his sword earlier, and it had been deflected by the bubble of light from Buser\u2019s armor. That would explain what had taken place just now. It would seem Buser\u2019s armor \u2015 which the Sorcerer King had lent her \u2015 had protected her. In other words, Neia\u2019s life had been saved in the nick of time.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Is that some kind of protection from ranged attacks? My chest, shoulders, and belly are protected by the armor, but what about other places? Does that ability have to be activated? No, more importantly, how many more times can I use it? Or has it already been used up?</i></div><div class=\"western\">Without the armor that the Sorcerer King had lent her, there was no doubt that Neia would have been impaled through her abdomen.</div><div class=\"western\">That fact sent shudders through her body.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHuh\u2026 huh\u2026 huh. Come on, come on, dammit!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Neia had not entered the radius of \u300cUnder Divine Flag\u300d. She had felt that it was unnecessary because she had the circlet which the Sorcerer King had lent her. That was why she could feel the fear of death like this. However, there were no tears in Neia\u2019s eyes \u2015 instead, she gripped her bow before revealing herself.</div><div class=\"western\">She had resolved herself to continue fighting, even if it meant taking the children\u2019s lives. She could not allow herself to lose the will to fight after taking a measly little ballista bolt.</div><div class=\"western\">This was to keep the children they could not save from suffering any further. At the same time, it was also to slay the demihumans who had dragged them into battle. The arrow she loosed embodied both these things.</div><div class=\"western\">The intention to attack without regard for the children spread from her portion of the wall, until everyone was throwing rocks at the demihumans.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia even saw the paladins throwing rocks.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cBastards! You bastards!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAhh, dammit, those demihumans\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry! I\u2019m sorry!\u2019</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026 please forgive me\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Although those cries of remorse echoed up and down the line, they did not stop throwing their rocks for a moment.</div><div class=\"western\">This was the attack made by those people who had accepted that some blood had to be shed to save the highest number of lives.</div><div class=\"western\">However, the enemy was far too numerous. By the time they had struck down the front row \u2015 the ones who were using children as shields \u2015 the demihumans had already reached the vicinity of the walls, and they began deploying their ladders one after the other.</div><div class=\"western\">While the technologically-backward demihumans could only make battering rams and assault ladders when it came to siege weapons, the truth was that there was no perfect countermeasure against both of those. Several men pushed the ladders away with long sticks and the angels destroyed several more, but regretfully, there were just too many enemies to face.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHow are the firebombs coming? Get the priests to assist with their spells!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThis is bad! They\u2019ve got a ladder up over there! I\u2019ll be going over, take care of this side for me!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThrow those rocks!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">There was a big commotion on top of the walls. The defenders were throwing rocks or stabbing with longspears to repel the demihumans who were clambering up the ladders, but the ladders went up one after the other, and it became difficult to deal with all of them.</div><div class=\"western\">Several demihumans nimbly avoided the spear thrusts from the militiamen, instead grasping the spears and pulling their wielders off the wall. Then there were those demihumans like the Armatts and the Bladers, whose natural defensive strength was comparable to full plate armor. They ignored the spears and rushed all the way up.</div><div class=\"western\">While the paladins had been trained in combat and could deal with these heavily-protected demihumans, the number of demihumans on top of the walls grew and grew. Any gaps which appeared were immediately filled up.</div><div class=\"western\">After stiffening her resolve, Neia leaned out from behind a battlement and shot a climbing demihuman from the side.</div><div class=\"western\">It was not Neia\u2019s skill so much as the weapon she wielded which killed the demihumans in one shot. She could slay the resilient Armatts and Bladers because she possessed the Ultimate Shootingstar Super.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia\u2019s body was clearly visible as she leaned out, and she was hit several times by stones spat by Stone Eaters. Although those stones could put dents in metal plates. Neia was protected by Buser\u2019s armor. Still, she would probably be bruised and she might have suffered a fracture or two.</div><div class=\"western\">Though she was sweating heavily, she did not stop firing on the demihumans for a moment.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>I can still do this\u2026 I only have enough mana to use the necklace of healing which His Majesty lent me once, so I need to save it!</i></div><div class=\"western\">As she continued landing shot after accurate shot, part of her mind tried to estimate how long she could hold out. After all, Neia\u2019s single use of recovery magic was her trump card.</div><div class=\"western\">She pulled an arrow from her quiver, nocked it to her bow, took aim at a demihuman\u2019s head or heart, and then loosed it. She repeated that sequence countless times.</div><div class=\"western\">A rock hit her hard enough to knock the arrow from her hand.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia hurriedly ducked behind a battlement.</div><div class=\"western\">She had dropped her arrow because the Stone Eater\u2019s attack had made Neia\u2019s entire body groan in pain, but that was not the only reason.</div><div class=\"western\">Paladins were sword-users. As a squire, she had trained with swords, so even if she knew the fundamentals of archery, she had not spent much time practicing with bows. This lack of practice made her arms cramp up and her fingers ache.</div><div class=\"western\">If she could not use a bow, then she would only be getting in the way. It was far too soon for her to use her trump card now, but she had no other way to restore her ability to fight.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cActivate:\u300cHeavy Recover\u300d!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The mana drained from Neia\u2019s body, and it made her feel a little dizzy. She would not be able to do this a second time.</div><div class=\"western\">At the same time, all the pain in her body vanished, be it the cramps in her arms or her aching fingers.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI can do this!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Neia leaned out again and continued shooting.</div><div class=\"western\">Fortunately, Jaldabaoth\u2019s forces possessed some degree of leadership. Otherwise, the ballistas would have fired on Neia to kill her without hesitation, but since they were being led, they did not shoot for fear of hitting their friendlies.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia continued shooting as if she were in a dream. Eventually the hand that reached down to her quiver came up empty.</div><div class=\"western\">She looked down in panic and saw that she was out of arrows.</div><div class=\"western\">Just then, a scream came from the militiamen.</div><div class=\"western\">There was a very strong-looking demihuman standing in front of a ladder. While it was no different from the Stone Eaters who had fired rocks at Neia, its physique was excellent. Though it was no match for Buser, it still radiated the aura of a powerful being.</div><div class=\"western\">It held a crude-looking greatsword in its right hand, which resembled a meat cleaver. The other held a helmet that seemed to contain something. It was the head of the paladin which commanded this area.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThe great Jajan-sama of the Lagon Tribe has taken the head of the enemy commander! Now, you dogs, kill them! Kill all the humans!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\"></div><div class=\"western\">***</div><div class=\"western\"></div><div class=\"western\">The situation immediately turned grim.</div><div class=\"western\">Paladins were few in number, and a death from among those small numbers meant that the defensive strength of this area would plummet. And then, there was one more thing.</div><div class=\"western\">There was a tremendous disparity in fighting strength between a militiaman and a paladin, even if the latter were not part of a hand-picked elite. There was no way the militiamen could win against a demihuman that could kill one of those paladins.</div><div class=\"western\">As the militiamen froze in fear, the demihumans scaled the ladder behind the Stone Eater from just now \u2015 Jajan. They burst forth like water from a broken dam, one becoming two, and two becoming four. It was like mitosis.</div><div class=\"western\">Demihumans began to fill the top of the wall, and in turn, the number of militiamen began to diminish.</div><div class=\"western\">Demihumans and militiamen. The difference in their individual abilities was plain to see.</div><div class=\"western\">She looked around in panic.</div><div class=\"western\">Arrows. She could not do anything without arrows.</div><div class=\"western\">She cast her eyes around like a traveller in a desert searching for an oasis, and then she saw a thoroughly exhausted soldier leaning against a battlement. There was a quiver with arrows beside him.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>That\u2019s it! I\u2019ll take the arrows from that wounded man and send him back to the rear.</i></div><div class=\"western\">But Neia sucked in a breath as she ran over. The man who looked like an archer was missing half his face. He was clearly dead.</div><div class=\"western\">He had probably taken a direct hit from a Stone Eater. His brains were oozing out, his glassy eye stared out into nothing, and his fate might very soon be Neia\u2019s as well.</div><div class=\"western\">She looked more closely, and found several similar corpses. Her usually-sensitive nose finally picked up the thick scent of gore in the air. No, her nose was fine, her brain simply had not received the input from it.</div><div class=\"western\">As the porridge suddenly rose in her throat, Neia forced herself to swallow it back down with all her might. She barely succeeded, but there was no telling if it was because she had been lucky, or because she had become resistant to this after watching the \u201clive eating performance\u201d earlier.</div><div class=\"western\">(TL note: the term here is \u308a\u3044, or eating live and twitching seafood)</div><div class=\"western\">Neia grit her teeth and transferred the arrows remaining in the nameless archer\u2019s quiver to her own. Restocking her quiver felt like she was restoring her own fighting spirit.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>I can still fight. There\u2019s still things I can do\u2026.</i></div><div class=\"western\">After quickly finishing up her work, Neia put the corpse\u2019s hands together and closed his remaining eye. There was no time to spare on doing that, but she could not stop herself from doing it.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI\u2019ll fight for your sake too. Until the very end\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">As Neia turned and rose, she no longer muttered to herself.</div><div class=\"western\">Her spirit rose to a peak it had never reached before, and her senses were incredibly keen. She felt like she was a part of the bow which she held.</div><div class=\"western\">The top of the wall was now a chaotic melee. Considering Neia\u2019s skills, it seemed almost impossible to snipe Jajan \u2015 who was holding up the head of the paladin \u2015 given the sheer numbers of friends and foes between them. However\u2015</div><div class=\"western\"><i>I still have these gauntlets! And the Ultimate Shootingstar Super His Majesty lent me! \u2015I can do this!</i></div><div class=\"western\">She loosed her arrow as she filled herself with that powerful conviction.</div><div class=\"western\">By the time Jajan noticed the whistling in the air, it was too late.</div><div class=\"western\">The arrow pierced his head, and Jajan fell limply to the ground.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cJajan of the Lagon Tribe has fallen by the hand of Neia Baraja!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Although she shouted those words, she was not answered by a cheer. That was only to be expected. There was no time for a long hurrah in the middle of a life-and-death battle. Neia felt a little embarrassed as she realized that, but she had succeeded in shaking the demihumans\u2019 morale. She could feel the pressure on them easing off.</div><div class=\"western\">It would seem this had not been a complete defeat.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia took up her arrow again, then turned to face a suitable demihuman before sending an arrow his way. She shot the demihuman through the head and he fell from the wall.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia drew another arrow from her quiver. She was doing it like it was nothing, like it could not be helped. Was she a master archer like her father now?</div><div class=\"western\">Her bowmanship had rapidly improved during the course of this battle. That was how she had managed to kill Jajan, though the latter had been wounded during the battle with the paladin.</div><div class=\"western\">Amidst the chaos of war, Neia sought new prey to bring down.</div><div class=\"western\">\u2015<i>I\u2019m an archer, so why aren\u2019t they targeting me?</i></div><div class=\"western\">That question was answered as her next arrow pierced another demihuman skull.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cDon\u2019t approach that human carelessly! She\u2019s wearing the Grand King\u2019s armor!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThe Grand King?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cGrand King Buser? Grand King Buser\u2019s armor?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Neia\u2019s sensitive ears caught the chatter which the demihumans exchanged.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cNo doubt about it! That\u2019s Buser\u2019s armor!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cDon\u2019t tell me that human brought down\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Ah! Is that it!? When the Sorcerer King said it would protect me, was he not referring to the armor\u2019s ability to defend against ranged attacks but the reputation of defeating Buser!?</i></div><div class=\"western\">The Grand King Buser\u2019s name was well known throughout the demihuman forces. Therefore, the demihumans who had mounted the wall were under the false impression that they were fighting the warrior who had defeated Buser. The fact that Neia had killed a leader-class demihuman in one shot only added to that.</div><div class=\"western\">That was why they refused to advance against her, even though they knew Neia was an archer.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>I have to hand it to the Sorcerer King, did he take this into account as well?</i></div><div class=\"western\">In all likelihood, few demihumans would chase her now even if she turned tail and ran. They would probably prioritize holding their ground over chasing a strong foe, even if they were making a mistake. Therefore, Neia\u2019s life was probably in no great danger. The Sorcerer King\u2019s advice to \u201cflee to the east gate\u201d suddenly came to mind, but she could not do it after all.</div><div class=\"western\">Anyone like that would never have come here in the first place.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia loosed another arrow, and killed another demihuman.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cUoooh! That\u2026 that glare again\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Glare\u2026 well, I am looking at them\u2026</i></div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIt\u2019s the eyes of someone who hungers for slaughter! That, that female human, at least, I think it\u2019s probably a female, she\u2019s no ordinary enemy!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Probably\u2026 a female\u2026</i></div><div class=\"western\">\u201cLook at that bow! It\u2019s amazing! It\u2019s not just her skills!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Hehe!</i></div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThe Mad-Eyed Archer!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\"><i>\u2026Eh?</i></div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWhat, what do you mean by that name? Do you know that human?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\"><i>\u2026No, no\u2026</i></div><div class=\"western\">\u201cDoes that female human have a nickname?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\"><i>\u2026Hang on!</i></div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI once heard there was a human archer with a devil\u2019s face and amazing skills with the bow\u2026 could that be it!?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\"><i>That was Dad!</i></div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThe Mad-Eyed Archer! The archer who killed Buser!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">For some reason, the phrase \u201cMad-Eyed Archer\u201d spread through the demihuman ranks like a wave. They\u2019ve already decided it! As that thought ran through her mind, Neia no longer had any opportunity to correct them.</div><div class=\"western\">As Neia loosed her arrows, the militiamen began moving.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2015Everyone, hold the line! Don\u2019t let the demihumans near that girl!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cOhh! Form ranks! Remember your training!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI\u2019m moving up!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">About twenty militiamen moved to act as shields for her.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cJust kill those bastards for us! We\u2019ll protect you!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cGot it\u2015\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The sound of flapping wings came from the enemy encampment.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia pivoted and pointed her arrow at the source of the sound.</div><div class=\"western\">Her eyes were filled with the sight of Pteropuses rising from the enemy formation. There were many of them.</div><div class=\"western\">While it seemed as though bypassing the wall should have been their objective, several of them dove from the flock and descended on Neia.</div><div class=\"western\">She had long since abandoned the thought of who to aim at. In this silent, pure white world where all she could see were her enemies, Neia calmly loosed an arrow at each and every one of her enemies. Her shooting was inhuman, unhesitating in its mechanical precision.</div><div class=\"western\">After downing the Pteropuses heading at her, Neia exhaled lightly. She could hear again after being released from that state of hyperfocus.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>To the side\u2015</i></div><div class=\"western\">She wanted to dodge, but a torrent of pain came from her left arm.</div><div class=\"western\">The Armatt beside her had torn her arm apart.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cGwaaargh!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Despite her cry of pain, Neia still made to pull out another arrow, but then she thought that she might not be able to properly brace her bow. In that case, perhaps drawing her sword might be better.</div><div class=\"western\">Her hesitation was a huge weakness, and the savage-looking Armatt raised its arm, preparing to follow up on its previous attack with a strike to the face.</div><div class=\"western\">She wanted to backstep, but her opponent was a superior fighter and managed to close the distance to her, so she could not evade it.</div><div class=\"western\">Intense pain filled her face. While she had managed to turn her head and thus avoided having her eyes shredded, the claws had ripped through her left cheek and opened a wound that exposed the interior of her mouth.</div><div class=\"western\">Fresh blood filled her mouth, and the taste of blood spread over her tongue. In addition, she could feel her warm blood oozing from her cheek, the sensation spreading down her neck and chest.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia had no time to draw her sword, and so she slammed Ultimate Shootingstar Super into the Armatt\u2019s face.</div><div class=\"western\">The Armatt had probably not expected her to do that with the bow, so it tried to back up to avoid the attack.</div><div class=\"western\">Since she could not move her left arm well enough to brace her bow, Neia drew her sword with her right arm.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia performed a ramming stab like she was prepared to die for it. The Armatt immediately countered with razor-sharp claws, but a nearby militiaman had wounded its leg and its aim was off. The claw missed her ear by a fraction of an inch, and in turn her steel blade sank into the Armatt\u2019s throat.</div><div class=\"western\">She glanced down to the Armatt as it collapsed and then surveyed the situation.</div><div class=\"western\">While she had been focusing on loosing arrows, the militiamen on the wall had been almost completely wiped out. The demihumans had reached Neia, and there were only five more men remaining, all pressed close to the wall.</div><div class=\"western\">The nearest reinforcements were fighting on the other side of the demihumans who had scaled the ladders, and they would be hard-pressed to help her over here. Frankly speaking, they seemed to be engaged in melee, so they would not have the free time to come help her.</div><div class=\"western\">There were over thirty demihumans in Neia\u2019s block, and there were only six people on her side.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia glared at the demihumans and they backed off. The pressure on Neia and the others eased a little.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cSorry about that, Baraja-san!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The militiamen who had been pressed to the wall took a defensive formation in front of Neia.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWe won\u2019t let those bastards past us, even if it\u2019s the last thing we do!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The person who said this looked like a cowardly man in his forties, with an unhealthy, protruding gut. However, his face was flushed with what seemed like the excitement of battle, and his body was covered in so much blood that one could not tell if it was his or the enemy\u2019s. Even so, he refused to kneel, standing tall with an indomitable spirit.</div><div class=\"western\">He certainly looked like a reliable warrior.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThank you very much!\u201d Neia said as she spat out a mouthful of fresh blood which had pooled there. Then, she continued \u2015 \u201cI\u2019ll leave this to you!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">He was not the only one who was like this. None of the fallen militiamen showed any sign that they had attempted to leave the perimeter they had formed around Neia. What else could she say except that she trusted them?</div><div class=\"western\">The man\u2019s eyes went to Neia\u2019s left arm, and his face stiffened.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI can see the bone\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cPlease don\u2019t say that, it hurts a lot when you point it out.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAh, ahhh, sorry.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Once one reached a certain degree of skill as a paladin, they would be able to use low tier recovery spells. However, Neia was only a squire, so she could not do so. There were no paladins or priests by Neia\u2019s side, and her mana had not yet recovered enough to use the magic item again. It would probably be best to abandon the thought of using her left arm in this battle.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia glared at the demihumans, but just moving her eyeballs made the wound on her face ache.</div><div class=\"western\">The pain made her gaze that much more ominous, and as the demihumans felt it, they went on their guard.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThanks to your shots, nobody else made it up here like that guy just now, Baraja-san. It\u2019s because of you that we managed to survive this long.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">If the demihumans before Neia\u2019s eyes rushed them all at once, the militiamen would probably be routed in an instant. However, they were all wary of Neia the archer, so they could not move together. In truth, she could understand their caution once she heard what the demihumans were saying.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThe Mad-Eyed Archer\u2026 could it be that she\u2019s nothing much with a sword?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cDon\u2019t get careless, she\u2019s just pretending she can\u2019t use a sword to throw her opponents off.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cReally? You\u2019re a real smart guy.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cShould we get the Snakemen over and kill her from a distance with spears?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Neia laughed in her heart. It would seem that she had gained quite an undeserved reputation thanks to the power of the magic bow she had borrowed.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026Is there hope for me?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Neia asked herself that question quietly enough that the demihumans could not hear, and then she laughed.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026If it\u2019s the bow\u2026 the bow I borrowed from His Majesty, the Ultimate Shootingstar Super, shooting wouldn\u2019t be a problem, but\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The man tried saying the name Ultimate Shootingstar Super, and then he laughed forlornly.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI see\u2026 so it\u2019s very bad, huh. Say, Baraja-san\u2026 you jump down from the wall and flee. You should live on.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Neia looked at the man.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAiieee! For-Forgive me. It\u2019s only natural for you to be angry at such foolish words. But, but, while I don\u2019t know what sort of hell you\u2019ve gone through, you\u2019re around my daughter\u2019s age\u2026 I think, but letting a girl like that die is just\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\"><i>I wasn\u2019t angry, I was just looking normally at you.</i> The thought crossed her mind, but this was a common thing by now and Neia did not take offense at it.</div><div class=\"western\">The man was speaking the truth. It would be wiser to fall back for the time being and heal her wounds until she could use her bow, rather than swing a sword she was not used to.</div><div class=\"western\">\u2015<i>What\u2019ll happen to them if I do that? I know very well. I can\u2019t help them even if I stay and fight. I\u2019ll just die for nothing. But\u2026</i></div><div class=\"western\">Neia swept the bow in her left hand down and to the side.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>I need to return this weapon. There\u2019s many reasons why I should run. But, but, what will His Majesty\u2019s enemies think if I run away while I\u2019m wielding a weapon that He lent me? In that case\u2015</i></div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHow could I run!?\u201d she bellowed. \u201cHow could I, as one who holds a weapon borrowed from His Majesty, turn and run!?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">She tightly gripped the sword in her right hand.</div><div class=\"western\">Repaying one\u2019s obligations was only natural for a human being.</div><div class=\"western\">The people of this country \u2015 specifically, the head of their paladins \u2015 were not the sort to do that, but she wanted to show the Sorcerer King that not everyone in this country was like them.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cUwaaaahhhh!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Neia\u2019s shout sounded like she was wailing. Since she could not use her bow, the militiamen would die for nothing protecting her. In that case, she ought to take advantage of the demihuman\u2019s mistaken fear of her power and attack while they could not bring their might to bear.</div><div class=\"western\">The enemy had probably not expected Neia to charge so many enemies, and they moved slowly enough that even Neia\u2019s meager swordsmanship was enough to cut them up.</div><div class=\"western\">The remaining militiamen behind Neia followed her lead.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia swung her sword.</div><div class=\"western\">It bounced off, and the demihumans swung at her open body, only to have their attacks deflected by Buser\u2019s armour.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia thrust her sword.</div><div class=\"western\">She stabbed into a demihuman\u2019s body, and when she pulled it out, its organs followed. Before that demihuman hit the ground, another demihuman\u2019s claws struck at Neia\u2019s face. The wound on her left cheek was followed by one on her right, and the blood which flowed out got into her eyes.</div><div class=\"western\">Intense pain filled her legs.</div><div class=\"western\">A demihuman drove his dagger deep into flesh.</div><div class=\"western\">One of the militiamen fell.</div><div class=\"western\">Swords swung.</div><div class=\"western\">Two more militiamen went down.</div><div class=\"western\">One demihuman collapsed.</div><div class=\"western\">All the militiamen were dead.</div><div class=\"western\">There were nothing but enemies in front of her and to her sides.</div><div class=\"western\">Her breathing was ragged, and her heartbeat irritated her.</div><div class=\"western\">The parts of her body which had been struck by the enemy blazed hot, and every time she moved them, waves of seizing pain filled Neia with agony.</div><div class=\"western\">\u2015<i>I\u2019m scared.</i></div><div class=\"western\">Neia was afraid.</div><div class=\"western\">She was going to die, and the thought of that frightened her.</div><div class=\"western\">She had been prepared to die here.</div><div class=\"western\">The enemy outnumbered them several times to one, and their individual fighting power was superior as well.</div><div class=\"western\">The enemy had all the advantages, and the only advantage her side had was their defensive position.</div><div class=\"western\">That being the case, it would be stranger if she did not die.</div><div class=\"western\">Still, looking death in the eye was terrifying even if she had prepared herself for it beforehand.</div><div class=\"western\">The word \u201ceast gate\u201d \u2015 said by the person she deeply respected \u2015 echoed through her mind. Though she was prepared to die, she still wanted to live.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia had once thought about what would happen when people died.</div><div class=\"western\">What would the moment of her extinction be like?</div><div class=\"western\">Her soul would return to the great flow, where the gods would judge her, and those who did good as written in the scriptures would go to a land of eternal rest, while the wicked would be delivered into a land of torment.</div><div class=\"western\">Still, even if she had accumulated good deeds throughout her life with the aim of reaching her eternal rest, she was afraid to face the end of her life.</div><div class=\"western\">She swung her sword.</div><div class=\"western\">That powerless strike could not possibly slay a foe in one hit.</div><div class=\"western\">Anyone attacking even when surrounded, would take vicious counterattacks from the enemy.</div><div class=\"western\">A sword pierced Neia\u2019s armor and cut into her</div><div class=\"western\">Neia was still alive thanks to the armor which the Sorcerer King had lent her. She would have died long ago without it. Indeed, she would have become a corpse like the countless dead militiamen and civilians who had been scattered throughout the city like they had been carelessly thrown away.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>I must be in really bad shape\u2026</i></div><div class=\"western\">Neia laughed at herself for being able to think about such inappropriate things even as she was this close to the afterlife.</div><div class=\"western\">Her feet slipped due to the force of her swing. Her left thigh seized up and her right thigh was injured and could not hold her upright.</div><div class=\"western\">She lost her balance and fell. She leaned against the battlements, but it was all she could do not to collapse.</div><div class=\"western\">The world was turning white and cloudy, and she could hear a distant, wheezing panting.</div><div class=\"western\">It was an annoying sound. She wondered who was making it, and realized that it was herself.</div><div class=\"western\">She was at her limit</div><div class=\"western\">Neia was going to die.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cJust a bit more and the Mad-Eyed Archer will be dead!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAhhh! All together now!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The voices of the demihumans came from far away.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>This is\u2026 a real pain\u2026</i></div><div class=\"western\">Neia could no longer tell what the demihumans were saying. However, they were probably not singing her praises. As her thoughts scattered into the void, a part of her mind thought only of things like that.</div><div class=\"western\">She was simply waving the sword she held \u2015 her attacks were meant to keep the enemy at bay.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>I\u2019m\u2026 so scared\u2026 but everyone\u2026 is waiting for me\u2026</i></div><div class=\"western\">In that white and cloudy world, she saw the smiles of her mother, her father, and her friends from her home village.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Who\u2026 are they\u2026 ahh\u2026 Bu-chan\u2026 Mo-chan.. Dan-nee\u2026? I\u2019m\u2026 scared\u2026 Your\u2026 Majesty\u2026\u201d</i></div><div class=\"western\">Her lungs and her heart and her arms and her brain wanted to rest.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia could no longer resist that temptation, but still, she had not broken yet. Why was that?</div><div class=\"western\">She was afraid of death. She was filled with her squire\u2019s conviction to fight to the very end.</div><div class=\"western\">Apart from that \u2015 she wanted to perform feats that were worthy of the wargear she had borrowed.</div><div class=\"western\">The demihumans\u2019 weapons thrust out all at once, stabbing into Neia\u2019s body.</div><div class=\"western\"></div><div class=\"western\">And thus, Neia Baraja died.</div><div class=\"western\"></div><div class=\"western\"></div><div class=\"western\"><b>Part 4</b></div><div class=\"western\"></div><div class=\"western\">The air of the battlefield had a unique smell to it. It was a muddled mess of all kinds of odors, and simply put, it was a revolting stench. Still, it was a stench that one could get used to.</div><div class=\"western\">One of the people behind the closed portcullis \u2015 Remedios \u2015 took several deep breaths of that stinking air.</div><div class=\"western\">Her eyes were fixed on the advancing force before her, which numbered over 10,000.</div><div class=\"western\">The leaders of the assault on this location were Ogres and horse-like demihumans. Remedios gripped her holy sword tightly.</div><div class=\"western\">She liked using the sword to settle matters. She loved it. It clearly defined winners and losers. After all, there would be no more trouble after you killed the opposition. Life would have been so much easier if things were all so simple. Her sister \u2015 Kelart \u2015 and her master \u2015 Calca \u2015 would no longer knit their brows.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHaaaah.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">She sighed.</div><div class=\"western\">After that, Remedios thought about what she had to do.</div><div class=\"western\">Gustav had said a lot of hard-to-understand things just now, but the gist of it was that they could not let a single demihuman past this gate.</div><div class=\"western\">The demihumans numbered in the tens of thousands. Around 10,000 of them were bearing down on the gate.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Not letting a single one past would be impossible if we were fighting on the plains, but here I can use the gate to limit the numbers who can attack me. So as long as I can keep fighting, it\u2019ll be easy enough to keep them from getting past! I just need to keep drinking fatigue recovery potions and keep fighting them one-on-one!</i></div><div class=\"western\">If Gustav were here and had heard this, the look on his face would probably say \u201cAre you fucking serious?\u201d and as she calmly considered that mental image, Remedios laughed. Still, the idea was quite ridiculous, and it was no wonder he would often grab his head in frustration.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>See how perfect my plan is! Calca-sama said I could delegate command to someone else, and Caspond-sama seems like an excellent person.</i></div><div class=\"western\"><i>Umu</i>, Remedios nodded.</div><div class=\"western\">After that, Remedios thought about the only flaw in her plan to \u201cfight one-on-one ten thousand times.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">That was the existence of Jaldabaoth.</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios\u2019s plan broke down when it encountered someone stronger than her.</div><div class=\"western\">She had trouble using her brain for the most part, but her mind was quite adept when it came to war.</div><div class=\"western\">That was why she understood that it would be very difficult for her to defeat Jaldabaoth. Of course, she could not admit that in front of her subordinates. She was the strongest paladin in the Holy Kingdom, and if she admitted her weakness, morale would probably plunge to rock bottom.</div><div class=\"western\">That was why they had brought the Sorcerer King over.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>The Sorcerer King, huh\u2026</i></div><div class=\"western\">The fact that they had to entrust one of the undead with the fate of the nation upset her so much that she wanted to throw up. However, they had no other option.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Tch. If only that undead creature had fought in a sneaky way, like using those goats or sheep which killed all those Kingdom troops. That way, no innocents would have to be sacrificed. Don\u2019t the undead understand that people with strength have to protect the weak? Still\u2026 he\u2019s really strong, isn\u2019t he?</i></div><div class=\"western\">Taking a city by oneself was an impressive feat. Buser was a famous demihuman \u2015 according to Gustav \u2015 and defeating him was also quite outstanding. However, Jaldabaoth was a different matter altogether. She had her doubts as to whether even a magic caster who could conquer a city without assistance could actually defeat him.</div><div class=\"western\">Perhaps she would have learned the truth if she could have crossed blades with him just once, but Gustav had desperately pleaded with her not to. Therefore, she did not know exactly how strong the Sorcerer King was.</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios remained dubious of the Sorcerer King\u2019s strength.</div><div class=\"western\">She had personally experienced Jaldabaoth\u2019s might when he had revealed his true nature, but she could not sense anything like that from the Sorcerer King. If he was truly able to crush the Kingdom\u2019s army, then he ought to be surrounded in an aura of power that could not be hidden.</div><div class=\"western\">Was that because he was a magic caster? However, if he was on Jaldabaoth\u2019s level, she ought to have been able to sense something from him.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>It would be good if he was really as strong as he claimed. Well, we won\u2019t lose much if he dies. That undead creature will be a thorn in the Holy Kingdom\u2019s side in the future. Ideally, the two of them would kill each other.</i></div><div class=\"western\">Remedios\u2019s opinion had not changed even after her subordinates protested it. No, it had only solidified after the Sorcerer King killed the boy who had been taken hostage. As a paladin, she could not tolerate anyone who could calmly commit such inhuman acts.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>The people of that country were actually ruled by fear, right?</i></div><div class=\"western\">When she thought about it, she found a lot of points which pointed to that conclusion. Perhaps having him and Jaldabaoth kill each other would be for their good too.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>The problem is the people of our nation. Gustav was right when he said that this was a chance for us. We paladins can show our strength and abandon the Sorcerer King\u2019s foolish opinions\u2026 Still, if Jaldabaoth shows up, we have to let him handle it.</i></div><div class=\"western\">Remedios took off her helmet. She wanted to scratch her head.</div><div class=\"western\">It was hard to imagine that the citizens of a country run by an amazing individual such as Calca would tolerate one of the undead like that. Just thinking about the matter should have revolted them.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Squire Baraja also \u2015 hm? Could it be that she\u2019s been charmed by a spell or something? Yes! He might be using some spell with a wide area of effect that forces people to like him!</i></div><div class=\"western\"><i>Dammit!</i> Remedios thought. She had not considered that possibility.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>I should tell Gustav about this. That said, it\u2019ll have to wait until we win this battle!</i></div><div class=\"western\">Remedios looked behind her.</div><div class=\"western\">There stood neat ranks of civilians holding spears and shields.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cBrave gentlemen! Regretfully, the Holy Kingdom is currently being trampled by demihumans, but you must accept it! Defeat the demihumans and save the innocent civilians \u2015 your friends and family \u2015 from their suffering! This is the first step towards our goal, which is to drive out these bastards here and take the Holy Kingdom back with our own hands!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">As Remedios shouted imposingly, anxious looks filled the faces of the militiamen.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThe filthy demihumans are attacking this place. Gentlemen, raise your shields and thrust your spears! Become a wall that will not let the enemy past you! There\u2019s no need to be afraid. Other than their first wave, the only demihumans you will have to deal with are the demihumans fleeing from me! All you need to do is hold them for a while so that the paladins and I can take them down!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">That eased their tension a little. While being too relaxed was not a good thing, being too tense was even worse. Remedios mused that all the militiamen she could see were in an ideal frame of mind.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYou lot were trained all day yesterday! All you need to do now is show the fruits of that training. No need to be so tense!\u201d Remedios paused for a moment, and then shouted louder than before.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cFirst rank! Shields up!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The first row of the militiamen \u2015 who looked like they were encircling the gate \u2015 braced their shields.</div><div class=\"western\">These were greatshields which could completely conceal a human body, and their bottoms were lined with spikes that were the length of a finger.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cShields! Dig in!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The shield-wielding civilians slammed the spiked portions down with all their might. Thus, they produced a wall of steel in moments.</div><div class=\"western\">Yesterday, these shieldbearers had vigorously practiced three drills. The first was to raise their greatshields into the air and slam them back down, in order to drive the spikes deep into the ground. The second was not to falter, regardless of the pressure they were under.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cSecond rank! Shields up!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">While the shields they carried were roughly the same size as those of the first rank, theirs did not have spikes. Those shields would go over the heads of the first and the second ranks, like a lid on top of them. This way, they would protect against attacks which made it past the first rank.</div><div class=\"western\">There were also paladins who could cast \u300cUnder Divine Flag\u300d spaced evenly through the second rank, to protect them from the fear of being pushed by the enemy.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThird rank spearmen, advance! Fourth rank spearmen, advance!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The third and fourth ranks were composed of longspear users.</div><div class=\"western\">Their longspears would protrude from between the shield teams, their butts firmly planted in the ground to stop the enemy\u2019s advance. The third rank and the fourth rank\u2019s spears were slightly different from each other in that the fourth rank\u2019s were slightly longer. Normally they ought to have had several more ranks of spearmen to form a spear wall, but since they were lacking in numbers, their aim was to overlap killing zones to prevent the enemy from breaking through.</div><div class=\"western\">It was a perfect formation.</div><div class=\"western\">However, it had a flaw.</div><div class=\"western\">While this formation did very well against warriors, it was very weak against demihumans with special abilities or magic casters.</div><div class=\"western\">It was true that the shield wall could block spells like \u300cFireball\u300d and greatly minimize the damage done. However, spells like \u300cLightning\u300d that had a piercing, line-shaped area of effect would pierce straight through them and out the rear. One could not say the demihumans did not have similar special abilities.</div><div class=\"western\">They knew this, but they had taught them to take that formation anyway because no other formation was effective in these circumstances.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cVery good! Then let\u2019s begin! Open the gate!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The portcullis began to rise as Remedios shouted. The advancing demihumans were shaken, and their movements slowed down. The defenders were opening the gate of their own accord \u2015 optimists might think it was a surrender, but realists would consider it a trap.</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios laughed.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYou filthy demihumans! I\u2019ll skin you and wipe my ass with your hides!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">After being taunted by a feeble human, the frustrated demihumans broke into a charge.</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios turned and ran. She planted both hands on the militiamen\u2019s shields and vaulted over them.</div><div class=\"western\">The demihumans continued their charge, several of them falling down as they approached the gate.</div><div class=\"western\">Large quantities of oil had been poured there, and only two outcomes awaited those who fell during the charge. Either they would pull down those behind them, or they would be trampled flat instead.</div><div class=\"western\">Unfortunately, the big-framed demihumans like the Ogres did not fall, and they made it into the city. The horse-like demihumans slipped and fell, which slowed them down.</div><div class=\"western\">A large demihuman\u2019s charge ought to be on par with a collision from a warhorse. However, if they could not follow through with it, then all bets were off.</div><div class=\"western\">The Ogres continued charging even though their pacing was messed up. They swung their large mauls back and forth, but the spears were longer in comparison, and they impaled several Ogres who had failed to properly judge the distance. Unfortunately, the Ogres were not fragile enough to be killed by that.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cNow! Throw them!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">In accordance with Remedios\u2019s instructions, firebombs flew over the heads of the militiamen, and the sounds of pottery smashing could be heard near the gate as an inferno sprang up. The demihumans around the gate were surrounded by a great fire.</div><div class=\"western\">The demihumans should have predicted something like this, but Remedios was certain that the fires were far beyond what they had expected. That was because both the oil on the ground and the oil on their bodies had ignited at once.</div><div class=\"western\">The Ogres facing the shieldbearers began to falter.</div><div class=\"western\">It was only to be expected, considering there was a blazing fire behind them.</div><div class=\"western\">While they had thicker skin than a human being, that did not mean they could not be burned.</div><div class=\"western\">Wails and cries rose from the vicinity of the gate. However, not many of them had lost the capacity to fight despite being enveloped by a fire of that intensity. One had to acknowledge the great vitality of demihumans.</div><div class=\"western\">Those demihumans only had two options. They could advance or retreat.</div><div class=\"western\">Black smoke blocked their lines of sight. Thus, they were robbed of all other options. While many demihumans could see in the dark, that ability did not allow them to see through smoke.</div><div class=\"western\">Nobody could act calmly while they could not see, were in anguish from the smoke, and when they were being burned by the flames.</div><div class=\"western\">Retreating was very difficult given the circumstances. That was because others were following closely behind them in order to storm the city. In fact, the demihumans outside the gate were hesitating due to the fire, but the ones inside could not know that, given that smoke obscured everything.</div><div class=\"western\">Therefore, the demihumans chose to advance.</div><div class=\"western\">That was exactly as Remedios had predicted.</div><div class=\"western\">The demihumans attempted an assault, banking on their powerful bodies to carry the day. However\u2015</div><div class=\"western\">\u2015The shieldbearers\u2019 third drill consisted of maintaining their shield wall even when surrounded by billowing black smoke.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cSpearmen! Pull!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The spears retreated as one\u2015</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cSpearmen! Thrust!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u2015And they thrust out in unison.</div><div class=\"western\">The demihumans gave voice to savage howls, thinking only of getting out of the smoke, and it was under these circumstances \u2015 where defense and evasion were very difficult \u2015 that they ran into the spear line. However, a commoner\u2019s strength would be hard-pressed to impale a demihuman\u2019s body. This was particularly true of the hand-picked demihumans who were intended to break through the gate in a frontal assault.</div><div class=\"western\">However, that was no problem.</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios did not think that they would go down in a single attack.</div><div class=\"western\">As long as the shieldbearers were in place, the spearmen could attack over and over again.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cPull \u2015 thrust!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">As she repeated the order, Remedios jumped over the shields in the opposite of her previous actions and cut down the demihumans where the spears could not reach.</div><div class=\"western\">Black smoke filled her eyes and throat, but she did not have the time to worry about that. There were very few demihumans who had made it through the oil and the portcullis, about fifty at most.</div><div class=\"western\">First she would kill them all and weaken the enemy\u2019s willingness to fight. Since they were part of the vanguard, they must have surely been highly motivated elite troops. Wiping them out would be more effective than killing mooks.</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios\u2019s breathing was calm and unhurried as she killed one enemy after the other.</div><div class=\"western\">Large demihumans like Ogres could not bring their full abilities to bear in a pitched melee.</div><div class=\"western\">The holy sword roamed everywhere without restraint.</div><div class=\"western\">Eventually, the shapes of the demihumans vanished from her tearstained vision. However, she could still hear a large force of demihumans on the other side of the smoke. They might have been in the middle of reforming their lines.</div><div class=\"western\">As Remedios slowly backed away, the silhouettes of several demihumans came into view.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cCaptain! Come back here!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Her subordinate paladin shouted to her as he cast \u300cUnder Divine Flag\u300d.</div><div class=\"western\">However, Remedios did not retreat. Her instincts were telling her something.</div><div class=\"western\">As the smoke thinned, she could sense three demihumans slowly approaching her, and shortly after that, her hunch was proved right.</div><div class=\"western\"></div><div class=\"western\"></div><div class=\"western\"></div><div class=\"western\">One of them was a warrior with the upper body of a beast and the lower body of a carnivore.</div><div class=\"western\">One of them was a four-armed demihuman woman.</div><div class=\"western\">And the last was a simian demihuman who was festooned in golden accessories.</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios had originally planned to kill tens of thousands of demihumans by herself here, and she was very confident of doing so. However, she now sensed that fighting these three demihumans at once was extremely dangerous.</div><div class=\"western\">There were only three of them. While she could not make them out due to the smoke, she could tell they were brimming with confidence, given their unhurried pace. Even their fellow demihumans seemed to have handed their task over to those three, unwilling to come any closer.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>\u2026They\u2019re strong. I don\u2019t know if I can beat them even if it\u2019s a one-on-one fight\u2026 or can I? I\u2019ve got no chance if it\u2019s three-on-one.</i></div><div class=\"western\">Remedios\u2019s instincts screamed at her to flee rather than take these three on at the same time. But how should she escape? She had no idea. In contrast, if she beat those demihumans, it would amount to a flawless victory for this theater of combat.</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios gripped her holy sword tightly, and spoke without looking back.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026Paladin Sabicus, Paladin Esteban.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Both of them replied with a \u201cYes!\u201d and, from the sounds they made, she judged that they had come to her side.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cCan you pin two of them down until I kill one of them?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The two of them replied in unison, \u201cLeave it to us!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios\u2019s instincts told her that she was being unreasonable. They might be able to buy a few minutes for starters. But how about sending more people to take the demihumans on?</div><div class=\"western\"><i>No.</i> Remedios shook her head,</div><div class=\"western\">Her opponents were a mere three people, who had entered the fray by themselves. Clearly, they were confident in their own abilities and wanted to show off their strength. Enemies like those would surely accept a one-on-one challenge. Such was the arrogance of the mighty.</div><div class=\"western\">In addition, such arrogant beings typically took pleasure in making the weak suffer. They would take the extra time to torment their victims even if they could have finished them off in a matter of seconds.</div><div class=\"western\">With that faint hope in mind, she decided on a three-on-three.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cPaladins, if the two who stepped up are defeated, continue fighting them one-on-one. The order goes: Sabicus, Esteban, Franco, and Galban.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">They were abandoning their advantage in numbers to buy time. Simply put, she was ordering everyone to kill themselves. However, the paladins did not hesitate for a moment when they received those orders.</div><div class=\"western\">This was what it meant to be a paladin.</div><div class=\"western\">This was what it meant to embody justice.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>This is what it means to sacrifice yourself for others.</i></div><div class=\"western\">This was probably the last time they would be seen alive and unscathed. Even so, Remedios did not take her eyes from the three demihumans for even a moment. She did not want to miss any chances to glean information from them.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>I don\u2019t have a clear picture of what\u2019s going on, but the first two demihumans look like skilled fighters. Perhaps that ape-like demihuman is a monk. That four-arms looks like a magic caster. Or is it something else?</i></div><div class=\"western\">There was nothing to fear when dueling demihumans who relied on brute strength alone, but demihumans who had been trained were truly frightening. If they had received warrior training, then they could stack their training and their natural physical abilities to become exceptional individuals who could surpass even veteran warriors of the Holy Kingdom. In truth, the opponent who had given Remedios her hardest fight \u2015 Jaldabaoth aside \u2015 was such an entity.</div><div class=\"western\">She recalled the blow that had stabbed her through her abdomen. That was why she paid attention when fighting demihumans and heeded the warnings of her instincts on top of that.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>\u2026Spellcasting demihumans are the most troublesome to deal with. It\u2019ll be bad if they can fly through the air.</i></div><div class=\"western\">While Remedios could use her armor\u2019s abilities to fly for short periods of time, she would not have her full range of movement while in flight. Ascending, descending, and turning were all very exhausting, and she would not be able to use her usual fighting style. If her opponent could cast \u300cFly\u300d, she might never be able to reach them with her attacks. While she possessed martial arts which allowed her to make ranged sword attacks, it would be difficult to win quickly when one took into account the fact that their effectiveness was a great deal lower.</div><div class=\"western\">The three demihumans entered through the gate, and then stopped.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2015To think we\u2019d have to join forces for a puny human.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">She could not make the three demihumans out clearly through the smoke, but their relaxed tone had reached her.</div><div class=\"western\">The hand gripping the holy sword beaded with sweat, and a bitter taste spread over her tongue, something that only happened when danger drew close.</div><div class=\"western\">She could keenly feel her opponents\u2019 approach.</div><div class=\"western\">The beast and the ape were definitely among the best of the best. While she was not sure about the four-armed one, the fact that she could stand by their side meant that she was on their level. In other words, these three demihumans were a match for Remedios.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThis smoke\u2019s getting in the way. What a pain in the ass.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">A strong wind blew the remaining smoke away with a <i>whoosh</i>.</div><div class=\"western\">The demihumans\u2019 forms were revealed. Standing at their head was a gigantic demihuman who wielded a battleaxe.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cZoastia!\u201d Paladin Esteban exclaimed.</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios was somewhat baffled. <i>Zoostia?</i> she thought. <i>Was that the demihuman\u2019s name?</i></div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHmm\u2026 well, it makes sense that you\u2019d know of me,\u201d the beastman said with an evil grin on his face. \u201cIn that case, I\u2019ll spare you on account of your learning, so that more people will hear of my strength.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHeeheehee, Vijar-dono. Jaldabaoth-sama will get angry if you take matters into your own hands like that. At the very least, have him drop his weapon and take him prisoner.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The entity addressing the Zoastia was the ape-like demihuman.</div><div class=\"western\">Thoroughly confused, Remedios turned to the people around her, a question mark floating above her head.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cZoastia? Vijar? Vijar Zoostia? Zoostia Vijar?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">While she was simply asking the names of the opposition, Vijar did not realize that and so he laughed in delight.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cKuhahahaha! You\u2019re calling me that because you\u2019ve concluded that I\u2019m the leader of our race? You humans have good taste!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cShe\u2019s just being polite, Vijar-dono,\u201d the four-armed demihuman behind and to the left of Vijar said in a mocking tone.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThat, that\u2019s right, it\u2019s just a courtesy, Vijar!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">It was only then that Remedios realised she had made a mistake about his species\u2019 name.</div><div class=\"western\">Right after that, the demihuman called Vijar twisted his face in displeasure.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHm, and I even asked Jaldabaoth-sama for permission to spare anyone who pleased me. Don\u2019t regret it.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWho\u2019s going to regret it? You can regret fighting us in the afterlife!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHeeheehee, what a spirited young lady you are\u2026 you <i>are</i> a young lady, right? I\u2019m not good with the ages of other species\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, that ought to be it.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The demihumans were probably being very serious. This was simply the difference between their species.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201dNow then, human girl, I shall introduce ourselves. I am Halisha Ankara. This is Vijar Lajandara, who needs no introduction. And last of all is Nasrene Bert Kyuru-dono.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThose names! Aren\u2019t they the White Elder and Iceflame Lightning!?\u201d Paladin Sabicus exclaimed.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cKukukukuku. Even the humans know our names. The fledgling, on the other hand\u2015\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2015Human. Do I not have a title like that?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of the name Vijar Lajandara. However, there\u2019s an axe-wielding Zoastia like you who\u2019s quite famous. It\u2019s the Demon Claw, Demon Claw, Vaju Sandiknara.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThat was my old man,\u201d Vijar snorted. \u201cI\u2019m the heir to the title of Demon Claw, Vijar Lajandala. I\u2019ll make sure you think of my name when you hear the words Demon Claw.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHeeheehee. We\u2019ll leave the human general to you then, Vijar-dono.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cSo be it. It\u2019s hard enough that you\u2019ve been forced to come right up to your opponents instead of using spells from a distance. Frankly speaking, I was planning to fight them all by myself.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHeeheehee. We were ordered to work together, you know?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cSo you\u2019re having trouble because you\u2019re getting on in years?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cTch!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The four-armed demihuman (Nasrene) who had clicked her tongue turned and gave Vijar a scary look. In truth, it felt like they might start killing each other at any moment if they were left unchecked.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cNow then, I really am fine doing this by myself\u2026\u201d Vijar stared at Remedios. \u201cBut let\u2019s hear your name before that. While it\u2019s a pain to have to listen to some mook name themselves, that sword of yours looks pretty good.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cRemedios Custodio.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Vijar and Halisha\u2019s expressions changed, but in different ways.</div><div class=\"western\">Vijar was smiling with bloodlust at the thought of meeting a strong foe, while Halisha was surprised.</div><div class=\"western\">Nasrene, on the other hand, remained unmoved.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cSo you\u2019re the one, huh? You\u2019re Remedios Custodio? They say you\u2019re the strongest paladin in this country. Excellent. If I kill you, I\u2019ll become famous. I\u2019ll be the Zoastia who defeated the strongest paladin in the Holy Kingdom. The new successor to the title of Demon Claw!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHmph. In that case, that must be the holy sword, right? Say, Vijar-dono, how about letting me face her instead? I\u2019ll have my people sing your praises if you let me take your place.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Both demihumans reacted immediately to Nasrene\u2019s words.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHeeheehee. So you\u2019re planning to hand it over and then ask Jaldabaoth for a child?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHmph, we\u2019ve decided that I\u2019ll deal with her. There\u2019s no need for you to do anything.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2015Begging to be bred by a demon? You make me sick.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios could not help blurting out what she really thought after hearing that exchange, and Nasrene turned to give Remedios an irritated look.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cSo you don\u2019t even understand what it means to bear the child of the supreme ruler\u2026 humans truly are moronic creatures.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cEven Jaldabaoth-sama would lavish care on the species of his offspring, no? When you think about it, there\u2019s a lot of advantages to being a woman, huh.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cOh yes. And if the father\u2019s excellent blood could be passed down, the child that\u2019s born might come close to \u2015 no.\u201d Vijar puffed up her chest. \u201cMight even be able to bear children that surpass their father \u2015 hm? Though you could consider me an exception too.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">These three demihumans did not act like they were feeling threatened despite being on the battlefield.</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios began to boil with anger as she watched them chatter idly.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHow dare you demihumans come here and spout nonsense? There\u2019s no use thinking about a future you won\u2019t have. I\u2019ll crush your stupid dreams here. No, not just you, I mean all of you.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHeeheehee. Oooh, I\u2019m soooooo scared.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">While Halisha looked like he was flailing his arms and legs around in panic, he was not actually afraid. That was because he was confident of victory even against an opponent like Remedios. It only served to displease Remedios even further.</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios shouted an order to the paladins, loud enough for the demihumans to hear.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cListen up. This is a duel. I\u2019ll fight Vijar. As for you\u2015\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI\u2019ll take him on,\u201d Sabicus said as he pointed to Halisha. \u201cIn that case, I\u2019ll take that one on,\u201d Esteban said as he walked in front of Nasrene.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026Oya? \u2026I\u2019m not a warrior so I\u2019m not too sure, but they\u2019re pretty weak, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHeeheehee\u2026 who knows? Best not to be careless, Nasrene-dono.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios picked up Vijar snorting at her, and she roared, \u201cHere I come!\u201d He must have sensed that those paladins were weak. No good would come of letting him mention it.</div><div class=\"western\">The first strike was key. The militiamen were watching her from behind with bated breath; not only would it wipe away their unease, it would also let her opponent know that he was facing a worthy opponent. For these reasons, she had to make an unreserved blow with all of her might.</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios hacked down on Vijar, holding the holy sword in one hand.</div><div class=\"western\">In response, Vijar raised his massive battleaxe to intercept her blow.</div><div class=\"western\">Both sides collided, and the very air shuddered.</div><div class=\"western\">She could hear shouts from the militiamen behind her. There was no time to slowly determine if they were cheers or cries of panic. Her full power strike had been answered by a counterattack of equal force.</div><div class=\"western\">The weapons of both sides were undamaged from that exchange of evenly matched blows.</div><div class=\"western\">If someone had brought a mundane weapon to this intense clash, it would probably have been chipped or bent. In other words, Vijar was also wielding an enchanted weapon.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cKuh!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cNuuu!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios\u2019s next swing grazed Vijar\u2019s upper body, sending forth a spray of blood. However, the battleaxe struck Remedios\u2019s chest at the same time.</div><div class=\"western\">While her enchanted armor turned the battleaxe\u2019s keen blade, the impact knocked the wind out of her, and it became hard to breathe.</div><div class=\"western\">In contrast to Remedios \u2015 who had been knocked back by the blow \u2015 Vijar roared and stepped forward, bringing his battleaxe down on her.</div><div class=\"western\">She did not have enough oxygen to counterattack. Remedios raised her holy sword high and gracefully deflected the battleaxe\u2019s force. That hair-raising strike missed her by a few millimeters and slammed into the ground. So powerful was the hit that for a moment it felt like she was floating.</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios turned to face Vijar \u2015 now defenseless because his battleaxe was buried in the ground \u2015 and lunged in with her holy sword.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u300cStrong Strike\u300d!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u300cFortress\u300d!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Having judged that he did not have the time to extricate a heavy weapon like his battleaxe, Vijar took one hand off its hilt and used it as a shield.</div><div class=\"western\">Vijar\u2019s right arm spurted fresh blood.</div><div class=\"western\">However, the holy sword did not reach Vijar\u2019s face. There were two reasons for that.</div><div class=\"western\">The first was because he had used a defensive martial art. The other was because Remedios\u2019s arm was numb and could not exert its full strength.</div><div class=\"western\">In that case, she would simply force the holy sword that had already penetrated deeper in \u2015 but then the intense pain racing up from Remedios\u2019s leg froze her briefly in place.</div><div class=\"western\">The source of the pain was Vijar\u2019s lower body; the forelimbs of his bestial body had swept across Remedios\u2019s legs. Her greaves protected her from most of his razor-sharp claws, but one of them had still managed to slice her leg apart.</div><div class=\"western\">At that moment, the battleaxe was pulled free and rose up.</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios took a step towards Vijar to keep the battleaxe from moving. Just moving her leg filled her with agony.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u300cStrong Strike\u300d!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u300cStrong Claw\u300d!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">As the holy sword stabbed in, Vijar deftly deflected it with his battleaxe.</div><div class=\"western\">In response, Remedios redirected the holy sword as it bounced away and guided it into a slash over the strengthened animal forelimb.</div><div class=\"western\">If Vijar backed off, Remedios would advance to close the distance between them.</div><div class=\"western\">They went back and forth several times, both sides using martial arts.</div><div class=\"western\">While neither side had sustained any mortal wounds, each round they fought sent blood splashing all around.</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios was certain that she had her opponent on the defensive.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>If this keeps up, I\u2019ll win!</i></div><div class=\"western\">Delight boiled up in her heart.</div><div class=\"western\">If she could defeat these three powerful demihumans, she could protect the people here. That way, they would regain their trust in the Holy Kingdom.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>There\u2019s no need for that undead being to show up!</i></div><div class=\"western\">Simply put, the difference between warriors and paladins was that warriors were offensive frontliners while paladins were defensive frontliners.</div><div class=\"western\">While it was hard to express in figures, one could say that a warrior\u2019s attack rating was 11 and his defense was 9, while a paladin\u2019s attack was 8 and his defense was 11. Needless to say, paladins could cast spells, but warriors could learn all sorts of martial arts, so it was impossible to make a simple comparison. Still, this was the easiest way to explain the situation to someone who knew nothing.</div><div class=\"western\">If the question was who would be better against a magic caster, the answer would be a paladin. Thanks to the protection of the gods, they boasted superior magic resistance compared to warriors. Therefore, if Nasrene had been a magic caster on the same level as Remedios, she would not have been much of a threat.</div><div class=\"western\">Next was Halisha, who was very likely to be a monk-type given his wargear and movements. Monks had the advantage against magic casters or thieves, but the reverse was true against paladins. For that reason, that monkey was not a frightening foe either.</div><div class=\"western\">Therefore\u2015</div><div class=\"western\"><i>If I can beat this Vijar, chances are high that I can slaughter all three of them.</i></div><div class=\"western\">Between \u201cfighting Vijar after being worn down by previous fighting\u201d and \u201cfighting Vijar while unhurt,\u201d the latter option promised better odds for her. Remedios had challenged Vijar based on that decision. There should not have been anything wrong with that decision. However, she had miscalculated\u2015</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cMy my. Dead already?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHeeheehee. Same here.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u2015Because the paladins fighting the other two were far too weak.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWhat!?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Had she overestimated those two paladins, or underestimated the strength of those two demihumans? Or was it both?</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYou\u2019re insulting me by taking your eyes off me!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Vijar swung furiously at Remedios.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cGuwaaargh!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">While she had barely managed to stop that strike, she had still been forced a short distance away. The tide of battle had turned in an instant.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cRemedios, was it\u2026 You do know that I am the great Vijar, a being of great power whose name will resound throughout the world? If you don\u2019t put all of your body and soul into it, you\u2019ll die in seconds, you know?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios bit her lip as she heard the sounds of the others fighting.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHeeheehee. I wonder if this paladin is strong enough?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026He\u2019s no different from the previous one\u2026 well, I can\u2019t really tell since I\u2019m not a warrior.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI am Paladin Franco.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAnd I am Paladin Galban. I will be your opponent.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Several seconds after they had spoken, she once again heard the sound of armored men collapsing.</div><div class=\"western\">Paladin Franco was a good man. While he was not a very strong paladin, he placed a lot of emphasis on getting along with others and he was well-liked as a result. In truth, he had been assigned here because Gustav trusted him. Remedios knew his character, and so she had given him the task of organizing the militiamen here.</div><div class=\"western\">She had heard that Paladin Galban was a newlywed. However, his wife was currently locked up somewhere. He had extinguished his desire to save her and had come to assist Remedios instead, in order to help more people.</div><div class=\"western\">These two people \u2015 who were too young to die \u2015 had been killed.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cDistracted again!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Vijar roared, and dealt her a blow that was even more ferocious than the previous one. Remedios flung herself towards Vijar, taking the blow on her sword arm, and then she slid her blade \u2015 but Vijar nimbly evaded it.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHm. What\u2019s this, some kind of bluff? Or did your body remember that movement because of all your training?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Vijar growled. He was not wary of a worthy foe, but delighted.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHey, fledgling. We\u2019re done here, but you\u2019ve been at it a long time. How about it, need help?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYou must be kidding. My legend will be tainted if I need your help to kill her. Many people will speak of this if I beat her in a one-on-one.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cVijar-dono\u2019s words are correct. How about this, Nasrene-dono. We\u2019ll destroy the humans\u2019 shields, and then\u2015\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2015As if I\u2019d let you!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">While she was still confronting Vijar, Remedios took her eyes off him and turned to look at the defenseless pair. However\u2015</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYou bitch! I told you already, I\u2019m your opponent!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Vijar did not allow her to do so. Her defense was full of holes, but he did not swing at her with his battleaxe, instead launching a kick. Remedios took the blow and was sent flying into the shield wall with tremendous force</div><div class=\"western\">The shock of the impact threw her breathing into chaos for a moment.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAiiieeee!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The militiamen cried out in fear.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cKeep your attention on me, human! Fight seriously!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Vijar\u2019s shout was followed closely by the sound of his footsteps. If he swung his long-handled battleaxe, he would send the shield-wielding civilians flying, creating a gap in the formation big enough that recovery would be impossible.</div><div class=\"western\">Even though Remedios had lost her balance, she still took a step forward, lunging at Vijar who stood in front of her.</div><div class=\"western\">If possible, she would have liked to finish off Vijar with her own abilities. That was because of the power that Remedios was holding in reserve to deal with the other two.</div><div class=\"western\">It was a powerful move that the holy sword Safalrisia possessed, which could only be used once a day.</div><div class=\"western\">It was a strengthened version of a paladin\u2019s holy strike.</div><div class=\"western\">It was the most powerful attack that a paladin wielding this sword could unleash.</div><div class=\"western\">Her instincts told her that it would be best not to do so. However, if she did not immediately defeat Vijar, the other two demihumans would kill more people.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>I\u2015 want to protect Calca-sama\u2019s wish\u2015!</i></div><div class=\"western\">\u201c!!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">She cried out without words, ignored her instincts as they screamed at her, and mentally sent a command to the holy sword. At the same time, she infused her holy strike into the blade and made her move.</div><div class=\"western\">The holy sword glowed with divine radiance, and light extended out to twice the length of the actual blade.</div><div class=\"western\">This light was apparently more dazzling the more evil a being was. In this state, avoiding or blocking this blow would be more difficult. The word \u201capparently\u201d came to mind because it did not seem that bright to Remedios\u2019s eyes.</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios raised her holy sword to the sky, and swung it down with all her might.</div><div class=\"western\">Since Remedios had lost her bearings, predicting the course of the attack was child\u2019s play. Vijar casually prepared to check the blow with his axe and then shove her back. However\u2015</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c!!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Following another wordless cry, Remedios pressed down on her holy sword while it was still locked with the battleaxe, and continued forcing it down.</div><div class=\"western\">She did not intend to have her sword strike its target through brute force.</div><div class=\"western\">The reason for this was because the radiance on the sword followed the path of the blade as it travelled down, passing through the battleaxe and entering Vijar\u2019s body.</div><div class=\"western\">This was the ultimate technique of the holy sword Safalrisia.</div><div class=\"western\">It was a holy wave that ignored defences and armor.</div><div class=\"western\">The sturdiest armor, scales, and hides meant nothing to it. Since it could even pass through magic weapons, it could not be stopped by weapons or shields, which made it an unavoidable trump card.</div><div class=\"western\">Of course, if one did not choose to clash with the blow and was nimble enough to avoid it, they would not be hit by the wave of light. However, there was no way to avoid Remedios\u2019s flashing strike while one\u2019s eyes were dazzled by the light.</div><div class=\"western\">As the wave of light blew past like the wind, the holy radiance on the blade vanished as well.</div><div class=\"western\">However \u2015 Remedios\u2019s eyes went wide.</div><div class=\"western\">She had clearly hit her target, but Vijar did not look like he was in pain.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026What? That was a flashy move, but\u2026 it hardly hurts at all. Is it just for show? Though I have to say, it did startle me\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios was shocked.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>This guy \u2015 he\u2019s not evil-aligned!</i></div><div class=\"western\">This technique was more effective the more evil one\u2019s foe was. In contrast, it did little damage to non-evil targets. It did practically nothing to good-aligned people. In other words, the fact that it had hurt Vijar meant that while he was not good, he was certainly not evil either.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>He made the people suffer! He invaded our country! How can someone like that not be evil!?</i></div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHeeheehee. Well, that was quite a spectacular light show, Vijar-dono. Are you really unhurt?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Halisha narrowed his eyes as he questioned Vijar.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIt was so bright\u2026 it\u2019s still burning my eyes.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Nasrene grumbled from the side.</div><div class=\"western\">She had made a mistake \u2015 she should not have used that move on Vijar after all.</div><div class=\"western\">Vijar tested his limbs and made sure his body was fine before shrugging. While he seemed defenseless, Remedios could not find any weaknesses in his defense no matter how hard she looked.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026A light show? Well, I\u2019m not too sure what that was all about, but it\u2019s nothing much, right?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026Vijar, I\u2019m kind of surprised. To think you were unharmed by that attack\u2026 I might have underestimated you.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cFuha! You get it at last! Hahaha! All right, human. You did well in making me look good. If you surrender, I\u2019ll kill you painlessly. How about that?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cDon\u2019t make those unfunny jokes! We haven\u2019t settled this yet!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios raised her sword and shouted at the three demihumans.</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios could still fight, like she had said. She placed a hand over her wounds and used her healing abilities. Her pain was carried away by the sensation of warmth.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>A lot of paladin techniques won\u2019t work on him since he\u2019s not evil\u2026 but since the two of them were dazzled by it, I\u2019ll save them for those two instead.</i></div><div class=\"western\">All she had to do was fight Vijar as a pure warrior.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHeeheehee. Well then, we\u2019ll leave her to you, Vijar-dono. We\u2019ll be hunting the humans in the rear.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWhat? You scumbags!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">All the paladins she had called up were dead. The militiamen could not possibly stop them.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAs if I\u2019d let you have your way!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios backed off and repositioned so she could face the three demihumans at once.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIt seems you\u2019re ready to take the three of us on at once, but Vijar said he wanted to take care of this.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHeeheehee. Our aim is to wipe out the humans in the city as needed, not to serve as your opponents. Nasrene-dono, may I count on you to wipe out that rabble in the back with your power?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAh yes\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">There were masses of magical power in three of Nasrene\u2019s four hands. One was ice, the other was fire, and the last was lightning.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cDamnit!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios ran toward the female demihuman\u2015</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI told you just now! I\u2019m your opponent!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u2015And blocked the battleaxe swung at her with a roar, but she was flung far away.</div><div class=\"western\">At this moment, Remedios realised that there was no way she could deal with Nasrene while fighting Vijar at the same time. While she could have just jumped right to Nasrene\u2019s side, defending against Nasrene\u2019s attacks would have left her defenseless body exposed to Vijar.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>What do you mean no way\u2026 I won\u2019t accept this! Not being able to do anything is just an excuse!</i></div><div class=\"western\">The moans of the militiamen stirred up Remedios\u2019s emotions.</div><div class=\"western\">These people had not fled in the face of terror because they believed in her. She could not show them a disgraceful side of herself.</div><div class=\"western\">She would not abandon Calca\u2019s ideals \u2015 to make a country where nobody would cry.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cMilitiamen! Everyone, fall back!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">As she gave the command, Remedios gathered her resolve.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>I won\u2019t die from taking a single hit. I\u2019ll rush that female demihuman while activating </i><i>\u300c</i><i>Fortress</i><i>\u300d</i><i>!</i></div><div class=\"western\">Vijar laughed as he watched Remedios break into a run. It would seem he had misunderstood something.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHo. It seems you\u2019ve made up your mind. That\u2019s the way! Fight me with all you have! Give me a battle worthy of a legend! \u300cShowdown Declaration\u300d!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2015Huh?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Vijar roared, and there was a special power in that roar. Remedios\u2019s legs, which were supposed to carry her towards Nasrene, charged towards Visha like they had gone mad. Nor was it just her legs \u2015 her sword, her mind, her vision, she could not pull any of them from Vijar.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u300cFireball\u300d.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">A third tier spell flew past Remedios\u2019s body and at the militiamen. Remedios could endure that spell, but it would be fatal to the militiamen\u2015</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2015\u300cWall of Skeleton\u300d!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The fireball collided with the grotesque-looking wall of bones that had sprung up in front of the militiamen and vanished.</div><div class=\"western\">Someone exclaimed in surprise.</div><div class=\"western\">Initially, it was because they had no idea what had just happened. However, it slowly changed. That was because they saw something descend lightly \u2015 like it was unaffected by gravity \u2015 and land on top of the frightening wall of skeletons.</div><div class=\"western\">That person possessed none of the intense emotions of the battlefield, and spoke with a gentle tone that seemed completely out of place with his surroundings.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWhile this is a common enough occurrence on the battlefield, I find it a little difficult to watch a three-on-one battle. You don\u2019t mind if I join in, do you?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The owner of that voice was undead.</div><div class=\"western\">Everyone in this city recognized him. He was the person who had originally refused to fight in order to recover his mana.</div><div class=\"western\"></div><div class=\"western\">He was the Sorcerer King Ainz Ooal Gown.</div><div class=\"western\"></div><div class=\"western\"><i>Ohhhh! </i>An earth-shaking cheer came from the other side of the wall.</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios tightly clenched her sword hand.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWhat, what\u2019s that, who is that?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026By the looks of it, I think it\u2019s an Elder Lich. So there\u2019s a type without skin. Still\u2026 does a mere Elder Lich have the power to stop my spells? Is it because of his robe? It does look quite impressive. Or no, is it because its summoner possesses great power?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios did not comprehend the demihumans\u2019 words at all. She heard the sounds, but she did not understand what they meant. That was because all her energy was focused on quelling the intense hatred welling up within her. She did not even notice that she was standing defenseless in front of Vijar</div><div class=\"western\">\u2015<i>Ahhhhhhhhhh!!! Why did he show up!? Why are they cheering for him!? Why! Why!! Why!!! For this filthy undead being!!!??</i></div><div class=\"western\">A corner of Remedios\u2019s mind was calm enough to note that it was a natural reaction to help someone in difficulty. However, it was overruled by her inability to forgive the civilians for cheering on the undead. The corpses of the paladins who had sacrificed themselves as shields to protect the people were clearly visible.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>You\u2019re not cheering for the people who fought as your shields, but for someone who showed up late!!!!!</i></div><div class=\"western\">She was so angry that she wanted to rip her helmet off and scratch her head while rolling around on the ground.</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios struggled to curb the anger in her heart, and she addressed the undead being on the wall.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2015Why did you come here?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The Sorcerer King\u2019s movements stopped, as though he had been frozen in place. The red flames in his empty eye sockets turned to Remedios.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026Why? \u2026I came? \u2026To help you?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026I see.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Why had he not come earlier? Was he waiting until the paladins had died? Did he plan to make a stylish entrance in front of the people?</div><div class=\"western\">She wanted to shout that at him, but\u2015</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThen I\u2019ll leave it to you.\u201d She did not phrase it as a request. She could not. \u201cAnd get rid of the wall.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHm?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI said I\u2019ll leave it to you!\u201d she shouted without thinking. Remedios strove to quell her rising emotions. \u201c\u2015And tear down that wall. You can\u2019t?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026Certainly not.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">In an instant, the wall beneath the Sorcerer King\u2019s feet vanished. The Sorcerer King did not fall down, probably because he was using a \u300cFly\u300dspell.</div><div class=\"western\">Remedios turned her back on Vijar. She did not mind if he killed her from behind. That way she could laugh at the Sorcerer King for not protecting her.</div><div class=\"western\">Having abandoned herself to despair, Remedios found it somewhat regretful that the demihumans did not attack her as she trudged back in front of the militiamen.</div><div class=\"western\">There was a hint of fear in the militiamen\u2019s eyes. Was the look on her face so horrible?</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2015We\u2019ll let the Sorcerer King handle this place! Let\u2019s go help where they need us more!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">After hearing Remedios\u2019s orders, the militiamen looked at each other, and they seemed confused.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAre you disobeying orders!?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">After Remedios glared at them, one of the militiamen quietly asked:</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAh, n-no. But\u2026 the Sorcerer King, by himself\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThe Sorcerer King is strong! Isn\u2019t that right!? In that case, something like that won\u2019t be a problem for him! Let\u2019s go!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\"></div><div class=\"western\">***</div><div class=\"western\"></div><div class=\"western\">Remedios led the militiamen to another battlefield. They repeatedly looked back at him as they left.</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz looked at the empty space where they had been and muttered to himself.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cEh? \u2026That bitch, she actually dumped it all on me.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">This ridiculous state of events made Ainz reveal his true nature.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Normally, wouldn\u2019t we have a scene like \u201cOh, let\u2019s fight together~\u201d or something? Or \u201cThanks for coming, we\u2019ll leave them all to you?\u201d At the very least she could have been polite about it, we could have gone back and forth several times about \u201cWill you be alright here?\u201d and so on\u2026 And not even a single word of gratitude after being saved? What the hell, man?</i></div><div class=\"western\">Frustration built in his heart. However, it did not reach the level of true anger, so it was not suppressed. It was like a tiny flame of indignation simmering inside him.</div><div class=\"western\">It was as though how someone had messed up and forced him to work overtime, and the person in question had said that they had something on and just up and left.</div><div class=\"western\">No\u2015</div><div class=\"western\"><i>I would\u2019ve been more angry. Like say, if I was going home to play YGGDRASIL\u2026 and the guild had plans already, and being late would cause problems for everyone. It happened before, and while everyone forgave me back then\u2026</i></div><div class=\"western\">Thus fuelled, the miniscule flames blazed up into an inferno, and then they were forcibly extinguished.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHm\u2026 While my anger\u2019s been suppressed, I\u2019m still unhappy. That\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve been treated so rudely.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">While she had shouted \u201cshut up\u201d at him before, the situation had been different back then. In the first place, they had agreed that Ainz could sit this battle out, but Ainz had still rushed over as reinforcements. Surely anyone who had an inkling of common sense would have taken a different tone when addressing him.</div><div class=\"western\">Everyone Ainz had met until now had been at least minimally polite.</div><div class=\"western\">That was why Ainz found it strange.</div><div class=\"western\">After cooling his head and searching through his memories, Suzuki Satoru recalled having met people like Remedios several times before.</div><div class=\"western\">Still, none of it comforted him.</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz turned his still-irate gaze on the three demihumans.</div><div class=\"western\">Granted, it was not entirely their fault either.</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz understood that he was simply taking it out on them.</div><div class=\"western\">What should have happened was that Remedios\u2019s relationship meter with Ainz should have maxed out when the latter saved her from danger, she should have apologized for treating Ainz this way all this time, and then worked hard for Ainz in all ways in the future. That was why Ainz had been observing Remedios from the air with \u300cPerfect Unknowable\u300dactive all this time, and then stepped in to help her when she was in trouble.</div><div class=\"western\">But in the end, things had turned out like this.</div><div class=\"western\">He could not understand how they had ended up this way.</div><div class=\"western\">If the department\u2019s quota was not met and it was close to the end of the month and someone stepped up to make up for the shortfall, surely everyone would be grateful to that person, right? Especially if that person had finished his own work long ago and had come back from his leave to help them.</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz had been observing the battlefield from above, and he had a firm grasp of the big picture. There were many more dangerous places than this. He was even aware that the girl who had glared at him all this time was in danger.</div><div class=\"western\">Even so, he had chosen to come to this place because he wanted to sell a favor to the highest ranking person he could \u2015 better to rule in hell than serve in heaven and all that \u2015 and he had judged that the captain of the Holy Kingdom\u2019s paladin corps was the highest ranking person here.</div><div class=\"western\">However\u2015</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI really am annoyed.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">As he grumbled without thinking, Ainz heard a piercing laugh.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHeeheehee. Looks like you\u2019ve been left here. Heeheehee, how sad, how sad.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAn Elder Lich. In other words, an individual that\u2019s powerful as a magic caster. Is there a need to be careful? I haven\u2019t seen that wall-making spell before, but it seems to be of a fairly high tier.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHmph. So it\u2019s still a magic caster, then? Don\u2019t really feel like fighting it. In the end, you need to beat a warrior if you want people to sing tales about you.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The three demihumans seemed to have recovered from the bizarre situation enough to banter with each other. Ainz turned to look at them, and his eyes focused on the ape-like demihuman among them who seemed to have laughed just now.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cDoes it matter? First we kill him, then\u2015\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2015Shut up.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz interrupted their conversation and cast a silent eighth tier spell, \u300cDeath\u300d.</div><div class=\"western\">The ape-like demihuman\u2019s smile was frozen on his face as he slowly collapsed.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026What? What did you\u2015\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2015I told you to shut up, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz once again cast a silent \u300cDeath\u300d spell.</div><div class=\"western\">The four-legged demihuman collapsed in the same way as just now.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cEh? Ehhh? What happened? What\u2019s going on?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The female demihuman who remained still did not understand what was going on, but it would seem she had already recognized who had done it.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWas, was it you? You killed those two in an instant\u2026?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Terror was deeply etched on her face. Her body was shaking hard.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYes, yes,\u201d Ainz carelessly cast a silent \u300cDeath\u300d on the female demihuman as well. \u201c\u2015Hmmm?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">She did not die. Ainz\u2019s \u300cDeath\u300d had been resisted.</div><div class=\"western\">In the moment he realized this, Ainz\u2019s mind immediately switched gears, entering a mental state that could be considered a combat mode.</div><div class=\"western\">Was it a defensive racial characteristic? A protective spell she had cast on herself? Had she resisted it normally? Had a magic item protected her? Or was it something else?</div><div class=\"western\">While one could not completely rule out the possibility that it might have been a coincidence, surely she could not have resisted it under her own power. Ainz had observed the three of them as they fought. While he did not think that he had the full measure of their abilities, Ainz was certain that they could not resist the power of his magic in a direct contest.</div><div class=\"western\">As Ainz mulled over the reasons for this, he felt that it would be best to stay on his guard and let his opponent make a move.</div><div class=\"western\">Perhaps he might discover something that could only be found here. He would like to see the trump card wielded by someone who could resist Ainz\u2019s usual attack methods.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHmm\u2026 Well, it doesn\u2019t matter what she did. What a waste of time. If I\u2019d known, I would have left that woman alone and gone to help elsewhere. I was thinking that if I fought together with that woman, we could have put on a show of hard fought triumph, so we would have spent a bit more time on the back and forth\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\"></div><div class=\"western\">***</div><div class=\"western\"></div><div class=\"western\">A chatty undead being stood before her.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>What kind of undead creature is this? \u2026The undead couldn\u2019t possibly ally themselves with humans. Is it being controlled by a necromancer? Still, that power\u2026</i></div><div class=\"western\">While she had no idea what he had done, he had instantly killed two warriors who were on par with her. Could such a powerful undead being even be controlled?</div><div class=\"western\">If his finger pointed to her, would she be the one to perish next?</div><div class=\"western\">The only people she knew who could do this besides the Demon Emperor Jaldabaoth would be the great demons who were his henchmen.</div><div class=\"western\">\u2015<i>That\u2019s impossible! Anyone who could control an undead creature who was on par with those mighty beings must be on the level of a god! How could such a necromancer exist?</i></div><div class=\"western\">If this human nation had such a necromancer, how could the Demihuman Alliance have pressed their invasion so far?</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Should I run? Should I take the chance to flee while he\u2019s acting all relaxed? Or can I even escape?</i></div><div class=\"western\">She did not possess any spells which were handy for escape. After all, she had never been in such danger before and had not felt the importance of learning such spells.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>In that case, the only way out is through!</i></div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAhhhhhhhhh!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">She used her battlecry to rouse her spirit, and began to cast spells with her trembling lips.</div><div class=\"western\">There was a fourth-tier arcane spell called \u300cSilver Lance\u300d. It was a physical-type spell, but since it possessed silver properties, it was a tremendously damaging spell against enemies who were weak against silver. In addition, it also had a special effect known as \u201cpiercing,\u201d which made it do more damage to unarmored opponents. However, it also had the drawback that its damage could be reduced by armor.</div><div class=\"western\">Her trump card lay in altering this powerful spell to produce new, unique spells.</div><div class=\"western\">There was the \u300cBurn Lance\u300d, which inflicted fire-element damage.</div><div class=\"western\">There was the \u300cFreeze Lance\u300d, which inflicted cold-element damage.</div><div class=\"western\">There was the \u300cShock Lance\u300d, which inflicted lightning-element damage.</div><div class=\"western\">These three spells all did elemental damage, so armor could not reduce their potency, and they still retained the deadly \u201cpiercing\u201d ability.</div><div class=\"western\">Of course, in keeping with their deadliness, those spells consumed far more mana than fourth tier spells.</div><div class=\"western\">She activated three of these potent \u2015 to her \u2015 spells at once.</div><div class=\"western\">She was simultaneously casting three spells, each one of which used a significant amount of mana. In addition, simultaneously casting spells was very draining in itself, and as the shock of using huge quantities of mana hit her, she felt light and floaty, as though she were about to pass out.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cDiiiiiieeeee!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The three lances flew toward the undead being \u2015 and then vanished without a trace.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2015Hah?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">She could not understand what had happened before her eyes. She could understand if it had taken damage, or shrugged it off. But this \u2015 this was like nothing had happened at all.</div><div class=\"western\">The lances had simply vanished.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cEh? Eh? What?

However, she ought to have been fighting demihumans. What on earth had happened?</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026That was a dangerous place.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">As she heard that calm voice, Neia narrowed her eyes and looked up with an abnormally keen gaze.</div><div class=\"western\">It looked like darkness.</div><div class=\"western\">It was not the darkness a child would fear, but the darkness which granted peace to those who were tired.</div><div class=\"western\">It was the Sorcerer King Ainz Ooal Gown.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYhour\u2026 Mhajeshty\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Neia reflexively reached up to him, like a worried child reaching for her parents\u2015</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cNeia Baraja. Do not force yourself to move. Let me take care of this place and rest.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Behind him, she could see the demihumans frantically attacking the Sorcerer King, stabbing him with swords, hacking at him, punching him.</div><div class=\"western\">However, the Sorcerer King completely ignored them. He spoke to her as though nothing was happening.</div><div class=\"western\">The memory of Buser came to Neia\u2019s mind.</div><div class=\"western\">The Sorcerer King reached into the sleeve of his robe and, after a brief delay, he withdrew a purple, poisonous-looking potion. Normally, potions were blue.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia did not question the Sorcerer King even as he poured that poisonous-looking potion on her. What the Sorcerer King did must surely be correct.</div><div class=\"western\">Reality turned out as she had imagined it. The purple potion that he poured on Neia\u2019s body instantly healed all of her wounds. It would seem the Sorcerous Kingdom\u2019s potions were of a different color.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWhile it seems a full recovery will be a long way off, you should recover your energy before that \u2015 what a pain. Tch. The militiamen are all dead\u2026 looks like there\u2019s a few left over there. In that case\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The Sorcerer King turned to face the demihumans as they attacked him from behind over and over again.</div><div class=\"western\">There was fighting all over the city at this very moment, and someone was dying with every second that passed. However, in that moment Neia completely forgot about that, because her eyes were stolen by the glorious back of the Sorcerer King who had risen to protect her.</div><div class=\"western\">Her unease and worries about the demihuman army were completely gone.</div><div class=\"western\">That was \u2015 what Neia had longed for.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>So it was here all along. I see\u2026</i></div><div class=\"western\">Neia was certain that she had found the perfect answer to the doubts that she had been holding on to all this time.</div><div class=\"western\">The Sorcerer King casually cast a spell.</div><div class=\"western\">A dazzling stroke of electricity raced along the top of the city wall. It was apparently a spell called \u300cChain Dragon Lightning\u300d.</div><div class=\"western\">The demihumans on the wall were swept away, so easily that it was hard to imagine there had been a life-and-death struggle here earlier.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cDid\u2026 yhou\u2026 dhefeat\u2026 them\u2026 all?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cNo, there were some people still fighting nearby, so I was trying not to catch them in it. However \u2015 \u300cNapalm\u300d ah, that\u2019s all of them. Next we have to deal with the idiots climbing up.\u300cWiden Magic Wall of Skeleton\u300d.\u201d A wall of bones suddenly sprang up on the outside of the city wall, where the demihuman forces were. While she could not see the other side because her vision was blocked, she could hear the demihumans on the ladders wailing, followed by the sound of objects falling and hitting the ground hard.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cNow to take care of their forces which are already in formation\u2026 I sent some undead over there earlier, they\u2019ll deal with it soon enough.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">As he spoke, he took out another potion. It was completely different from the one just now, being stored in a beautiful, slender phial. While she had no idea what the potion inside it could do, it looked like it must be a very valuable item.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI, ahm fhine, Yhour Mhajeshty\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026Enough of that. I\u2019m sorry I was late in saving you.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The Sorcerer King shielded the upper halves of his eye sockets like he was being dazzled as he poured out the contents of the bottle. The sense of weakness she had been feeling since just now melted away. However, her body still felt heavy. She felt like something had been scraped away from herself, but matching it \u2015 no, exceeding it \u2015 was a warmth in the core of her body.</div><div class=\"western\">She could get up like this. While her body still hurt so much that her tears had leaked out, she could not remain in such a disgraceful posture in front of the person who had come to save her.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cStop \u2015 Miss Baraja. There\u2019s no need to force yourself to stand.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">While she wanted to get up, Neia obediently lay back as he pushed her shoulders down.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYes, like that\u2026 I\u2019ll get someone to carry you. \u2015You lot, over here!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The Sorcerer King waved to what seemed to be militiamen.</div><div class=\"western\">It was at this point that Neia realized that for the sake of expressing her gratitude, she had not yet asked a question which had to be asked.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYour Majesty, will you be alright? You came to help us and used the mana you should have been saving to fight Jaldabaoth.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIt\u2019s fine. When you think about it, it couldn\u2019t be helped considering that it was for the sake of saving you.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYour Majesty\u2026\u201d A weighty stone seemed to have fallen from her chest. \u201cI understand now.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHm? What is it?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The Sorcerer King waited for Neia\u2019s reply.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI understand what justice is.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2015Ah, so you\u2019ve found the justice that belongs to you? That\u2019s good. \u2026Is it protecting the weak, or something?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">His voice was full of tenderness, and so Neia replied with confidence.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYour Highness is justice.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">For a moment, the Sorcerer King froze.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026.Hm?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI understand now! Your Highness is justice!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026Ah, is that so. You must be tired. Don\u2019t you think it would be better to rest? You\u2019ll think of strange things when you\u2019re tired. Surely you won\u2019t want to roll around on the bed and make weird noises after you calm down, right?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI\u2019m a little tired, but more importantly, my heart has cleared up. I am absolutely certain that Your Highness is justice!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cNo, nono, I said so back then, but I\u2019m not justice. Look, what they call justice ought to be something like protecting the weak is common sense, that kind of\u2026 uh, abstract concept. Right? I mean, normally speaking.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cNo. Justice without power is meaningless, but power like what Jaldabaoth possesses is not justice either. Therefore, being strong, and using that strength to aid others is truly justice; in other words, you are the incarnation of justice, Your Majesty!!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">As Neia\u2019s eyes went wide while she spoke, the Sorcerer King suddenly raised his hand, and then placed it over Neia\u2019s eyes like he was coaxing her to sleep. The pleasant coolness of his fingerbones made Neia\u2019s cheeks relax.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026Ah. If you shout too loud, won\u2019t it make your wounds hurt? After this, we can slowly continue what you were talking about just now.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYes! Your Majesty!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">She heard the sound of several footsteps, and by shifting her gaze, she saw the forms of paladins and militiamen approaching her.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYour Highness! Thank you very much for coming here to help us!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cDon\u2019t mention it.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">As he answered, the Sorcerer King slowly rose to his feet. Neia felt lonely as he stood up and wanted to reach for the Sorcerer King\u2019s robe, but then she realised that doing so would be terribly shameful and so she curbed herself.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2015No, actually, maybe you should. Therefore, I hope you will take Squire Baraja to a safe place in order to show your gratitude. While you can\u2019t see it from here, I\u2019ve already sent the undead I made into the demihuman encampment, so it should be alright for you to stand down for a while.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYour Majesty\u2015\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2015Neia Baraja. And also, the people of this country. Let me handle the rest. I promise you that I will do my best to save the people of this city.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The Sorcerer King floated lightly into the air.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAlso, there\u2019s one more thing. Can you help me move the bodies of those three demihumans over there? They were strong foes, so I want to study them carefully.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The three corpses to which the Sorcerer King pointed looked like they had once been very impressive demihumans.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cMove them with their wargear. Don\u2019t worry about being rough with them, but do not misplace their equipment. I\u2019ll leave that to you.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">As he watched the Sorcerer King fly into the air, a paladin turned to Neia.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cSquire Neia Baraja, while we would like to carry you\u2026 the lack of materials for a stretcher makes things difficult. Can you stand?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYes, though it\u2019s difficult.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Neia slowly got to her feet. Her legs were trembling, and they ached as soon as they took her weight. Neia leaned on a militiaman\u2019s shoulder and hung on tightly to him.</div><div class=\"western\">Looking down from the city wall, the unit that was supposed to be defending the west gate was gone, and there were no bodies. The sound of clashing blades on the wind seemed to be coming from far away, so taking the shortest route down from the side tower ought to be fine.</div><div class=\"western\">Neia sought the form of the Sorcerer King who had disappeared into the sky, and as she thought that it was a shame that she could not see him, Neia entered the side tower.</div><div class=\"western\"></div><div class=\"western\">***</div><div class=\"western\"></div><div class=\"western\">As he greeted the demihumans invading the city with attack spells from the air, Ainz thought about the sequence of events which had transpired and wrinkled his nonexistent brows.</div><div class=\"western\">\u2015<i>That was a huge mistake. The order was all wrong. I should have prioritized Neia Baraja over that annoying woman.</i></div><div class=\"western\">Neia had died because he helped Remedios and was thus delayed in going to Neia\u2019s side. He had to use a high level wand to resurrect Neia, because he was not sure how high level Neia was, and he was afraid of her turning to ash like the Lizardman from back then.</div><div class=\"western\">In truth, he had no idea whether the price of resurrecting Neia was justified by the benefits she could bring to Ainz and Nazarick. That said, since the plan to help Remedios and indebt her to him had been a complete failure, he ought to at least try again with Neia, which was why he had chosen to resurrect her. However\u2015</div><div class=\"western\"><i>\u2026Would a Wand of Resurrection \u2015 a seventh tier spell \u2015 have been fine as well? \u2026It seems I was being too generous. Also, it\u2019ll take an hour before I can swap out this ring.</i></div><div class=\"western\">Ainz was looking at one of his eight rings, the one on his right thumb.</div><div class=\"western\">It was the Ring of Wand Mastery.</div><div class=\"western\">Said ring was an ultra-rare artifact dropped by a boss.</div><div class=\"western\">Normally, only magic casters of the appropriate tradition would be able to use the spells stored within a wand. For instance, only a divine caster could use a wand imbued with the first tier divine spell \u300cLight Healing\u300d. If they could be used by magic casters of other traditions, then they would be staves, which were more expensive.</div><div class=\"western\">That said, a patch had updated certain wands so they could be used by all players. Unfortunately, the wand imbued with the ninth tier spell \u300cTrue Resurrection\u300d that he had used to resurrect Neia was not one of them, and Ainz would not be able to use it under normal circumstances.</div><div class=\"western\">However, he could use it as long as he had this ring.</div><div class=\"western\">Yet every time the ring was used, it only applied to one wand at a time, and he would have to wait an hour before he could change it out. It also carried the drawback of requiring mana to use, but it was still a very valuable item regardless.</div><div class=\"western\">Due to its high rarity, very few people in the guild \u201cAinz Ooal Gown\u201d possessed it, and the one which Ainz had was left to him by Amanomahitotsu when he had quit the game.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Well, it doesn\u2019t look like I\u2019ll need to use that wand anywhere else, so I shouldn\u2019t let it bother me. Speaking of which, I just realized when I covered her eyes, it feels like she simply respects me. Given what she said\u2026 does that mean I\u2019ve gained her trust? Umu. I wonder what happened?</i></div><div class=\"western\">Ainz recalled Neia\u2019s reaction.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Her gratitude sounded sincere\u2026 but at the same time it felt like she was glaring at me. Is it because her face is scary? How about recommending she wear sunglasses or something?</i></div><div class=\"western\">Ainz might have thought that, but of course he could not actually say it. In the carriage, she had mentioned being conscious of how scary her eyes had looked.</div><div class=\"western\">If one encountered a lady with smelly armpits, how would they react when you said, \u201cYou stink,\u201d and gave them a bottle of perfume?</div><div class=\"western\"><i>It feels like all the respect I\u2019ve cultivated would vanish and she would only resent me\u2026</i></div><div class=\"western\">In addition, Ainz \u2015 Suzuki Satoru \u2015 was not brave enough to say such things.</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz spotted a cluster of demihumans nearby and discharged an area-effect spell at the ground, slaughtering them all. The militiamen who had been facing them waved to him. Ainz raised his arm as well by way of response. Originally, he had intended to just raise his hand, but there was a distance between them, so he put his arm up high in order for them to see him.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>That\u2019s right~ It\u2019s the merciful Sorcerer King~ Be grateful to me~ speaking of which, does resurrection magic make people go mad or act weirdly? Compared to that, it would be better if she was just pumped up or on a buzz\u2026</i></div><div class=\"western\">Ainz thought about Neia.</div><div class=\"western\">It felt strange no matter how he thought about it. She had been perfectly normal when he had parted ways with her, but she had ended up like that after being brought back to life.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Is she mad? Should I heal her with magic? It would be a little scary if it was a side effect of resurrection. I don\u2019t want to end up warping her personality as time passes.</i></div><div class=\"western\">There had been a strange force in Neia\u2019s murderous eyes, an insane, ferocious gleam that frightened him.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>It\u2019s so bad that she mistook me for justice, huh. Some rest ought to help with that\u2026 oh.</i></div><div class=\"western\">Ainz turned his gaze to the demihuman position.</div><div class=\"western\">Half of it had already been destroyed, and Soul Eaters were walking lazily among the fleeing demihumans. Even that much was enough to send the demihumans collapsing in droves from their instant death auras. The Soul Eaters who consumed their souls became stronger in turn.</div><div class=\"western\">When Soul Eaters appeared in YGGDRASIL, they were almost always level-appropriate encounters, so the chances of a player being downed by an instant death effect would only be one in a hundred or less. That was why this special ability of Soul Eaters rarely got the chance to see use.</div><div class=\"western\">However, it was different this time. This was the perfect opportunity to show it off.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cSouls, huh\u2026 oh no. I should have experimented with this.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz suddenly landed. Then he used his ability to create mid-tier undead to craft a Soul Eater.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Go.</i></div><div class=\"western\">After he issued a mental command, the Soul Eater immediately began to move. At the same time, he sent an order to the Soul Eaters who were obliterating the demihumans outside.</div><div class=\"western\">It went: <i>leave some prey for the newly-made Soul Eater.</i></div><div class=\"western\">Undead created with corpses did not vanish with the passage of time. But why did they not vanish?</div><div class=\"western\"><i>If it\u2019s not because they\u2019re using the corpse as a medium, but the soul, does it mean that Soul Eaters which have eaten souls won\u2019t vanish? \u2026Well, even if I found the answer I wouldn\u2019t know where to apply it. Still, knowing is better than not knowing.</i></div><div class=\"western\">He ascended into the sky once more, and verified that the city was safe. Most of the demihumans should have been wiped out by now, but he ought to be careful, just in case.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Muu, that annoying woman is there. Ignore her, ignore her.</i></div><div class=\"western\">Ainz looked away from Remedios and flew elsewhere.</div><div class=\"western\">As Ainz flew, he could hear cheers coming from below him, and Ainz responded with a wave of the hand. After verifying that there were no more demihumans \u2015 that the fighting had ended, Ainz began making his way to the war room. He would need a lot of time to return to Nazarick and take care of all sorts of annoying meetings.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI need to handle this properly\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">A crushing surge of uneasiness flooded into him, and then his emotion suppression calmed him down. The only thing that remained was a chilly sensation in his heart.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>I need to use </i><i>\u300c</i><i>Message</i><i>\u300d </i><i>to tell Demiurge to meet me in Nazarick.</i></div><div class=\"western\"></div><div class=\"western\">***</div><div class=\"western\"></div><div class=\"western\">Once Ainz made his move, victory was all too easy. After wiping out the demihumans attacking the city and finishing a couple of other things, Ainz returned to his own room.</div><div class=\"western\">One of those things was to show his face at Caspond\u2019s chambers and ask him for some minor favors in the future. The long and short of it was that after trampling the demihuman encampment underfoot, he had no issue with giving them the leftover rations and everything else \u2015 magic items excepted.</div><div class=\"western\">Since Ainz had devastated the demihuman camp by himself, then the spoils from the demihumans should have rightfully belonged to him. Dumping them into the Exchange Box would have yielded quite a tidy sum. However, if he monopolized it all, the goodwill he had so painstakingly built up might end up losing its value. That being the case, he ought to write it off as an investment and give it all to the Holy Kingdom. Of course, there might be valuable magical items among the loot, and he had no intention of giving those up.</div><div class=\"western\">Normally, Ainz would have gone to the camp by himself and used \u300cGreater Magic Vision\u300d, \u300cDetect Magic\u300d and other such divination spells to examine the scene, but he felt that there was no need to do so. In addition, Demiurge ought to have investigated what magic items the demihumans possessed ahead of time. Even if something had slipped the net, there ought to have been nothing there which could harm Ainz. If there was, then it would have been more eye-catching.</div><div class=\"western\">After that, he went to recover the equipment from those three demihumans. As expected, nobody had dared loot the corpses, and so Ainz recovered their magical items without incident. Of course, he had an idea of how powerful those items were from the mana they contained, but he still held out hope for something bizarre or unusual.</div><div class=\"western\">He dumped them onto the bed and prepared to magically investigate each and every one of them, but he had something he needed to do first.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2015Now then!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">He deliberately made noise.</div><div class=\"western\">Part of that was to psyche himself up, but there was another meaning to it.</div><div class=\"western\">There was something he needed to do before sending the \u300cMessage\u300d to Demiurge.</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz took out a scroll \u2015 Demiurge-brand \u2015 and cast a spell, whereupon a pair of bunny ears sprouted from Ainz\u2019s head.</div><div class=\"western\">He used them to check for nearby sounds, and it seemed like there was nobody hiding to spy on him. However, that was not enough to put him at ease. After all, there was magic, such as the second tier spell \u300cSilence\u300d, which could eliminate sound, and then there were also thief skills, so it was too early to conclude that there was nobody around just because he could not hear anything.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>It\u2019s thanks to Demiurge\u2019s farm \u2015 which allows us to obtain raw materials easily \u2015 that I can use scrolls this casually. Dumping large quantities of produce into the Exchange Box means we can make back the gold spent on the scrolls without any problems. I\u2019ve thought about this before, but I have a good feeling about the various ways in which Nazarick is developing.</i></div><div class=\"western\">They could still use the ordinary parchment from this world for first tier spells like \u300cRabbit\u2019s Ear\u300d. One would need YGGDRASIL materials to go any higher. However, part of the supply problem had already been solved.</div><div class=\"western\">While it was true that they could only be used as substitutes for up to third tier scrolls, Demiurge had already done a great deal of work. The first and most indisputable thing was that when considering everything that had been done until now, he was the most deserving of commendation for his contributions. Next would be Albedo and her perfect management of Nazarick.</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz then went on to use his ability to create lesser undead and brought forth a Wraith.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Check the surroundings and see if anyone\u2019s spying on me.</i></div><div class=\"western\">After receiving the order, the Wraith left the room without opening the door. Wraiths had astral bodies, and so they could move straight through walls and other such obstacles. Still, there was a limit depending on how thick those walls were, so it was hardly unlimited, but the thickness of the room\u2019s walls were no problem for it.</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz focused his mind on the ears he had sprouted.</div><div class=\"western\">Even if there was a skillful thief lying in wait, could they really remain motionless if an undead creature suddenly appeared, especially if it was surrounded by an aura of fear? In addition, they would need a concealment ability that could hide them from detection by a Wraith. Of course, deceiving low tier undead was easy, but if someone actually possessed these abilities, then they must be very capable indeed.</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz concluded that there could not be such a person. If there was someone like that in this nation, then they should have had them take part in the previous two battles.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>That said, I can\u2019t rule out the possibility that someone like that might be wary of me and thus lying in wait. Still, given that woman\u2019s personality, it shouldn\u2019t be possible\u2026 if there was someone like that, it wouldn\u2019t be unusual for Demiurge to inform me about them.</i></div><div class=\"western\">It would not be unusual. As he thought of those words, Ainz wondered, <i>Is that really the case?</i></div><div class=\"western\">Surely Demiurge would not have felt that Ainz would have understood even if he did not say anything, right?</div><div class=\"western\"><i>\u2026Ah, the more I think about it, the more my stomach hurts\u2026</i></div><div class=\"western\">If such a mistake had resulted, then he ought to gather his resolve and sit Albedo and Demiurge down for a good chat.</div><div class=\"western\">Eventually, the undead being returned.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWas anyone there?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">The undead being replied in the negative. Ainz\u2019s ears had not picked up any suspicious sounds either.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cIs that so? Then hide in the walls and keep an eye on the surroundings.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">After watching the undead being enter a wall, Ainz mentally prepared himself.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Now then, I\u2019ll be casting </i><i>\u300c</i><i>Message</i><i>\u300d </i><i>next.</i></div><div class=\"western\">It was a simple thing, but he could not bring himself to do it.</div><div class=\"western\">He felt like an employee who knew he would be scolded by his boss after returning to the office.</div><div class=\"western\">Still, he could not stay this way forever. His heart would also be heavy if Demiurge contacted him first.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cTime to do it, me!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">After cheering himself up, he sent a \u300cMessage\u300d to Demiurge. He had rehearsed what he wanted to say in his head countless times and had run more than enough simulations. All he had to do now was say it.</div><div class=\"western\">However the \u300cMessage\u300d connected before he could breathe in deeply to ease his stress \u2015 or rather, there was practically no delay between casting the spell and opening a channel to Demiurge. The response had been way too fast.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cDemiurge, is that you?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u300eIndeed it is, Ainz-sama.\u300f</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cUmu.\u201d He had practiced this many times. All he had to do now was say it.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026I was wondering if you had any questions about the divergence of my actions from the report, and so I contacted you. While I understand what you want to say, I feel that Albedo ought to be present as well if there are detailed questions. Return to Nazarick without delay. I will be returning presently as well. We\u2019ll meet in the log cabin on the surface.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u300eUnderstood. Then I will contact Albedo from my end.\u300f</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAhh, please do.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">He immediately cut off the \u300cMessage\u300d. After that, Ainz sighed deeply.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Ahhh, that\u2019s good. He didn\u2019t sound mad. Ahhh, that was scary.</i></div><div class=\"western\"><i>What should I do if a talented subordinate gets mad at me?</i> he had thought. Ainz\u2019s heart was full of fear; in order to put himself at ease, he channelled new strength into his faltering body and stared at the wall.</div><div class=\"western\">The Wraith\u2019s mission was complete. Thanks to friendly fire being on, he could destroy the undead like Shalltear had, but there was no need to waste his strength. Ordering it to return was also a simple task. Incidentally, there was no need to speak either; he could simply issue a mental command. In that way, he could break the tenuous link between them.</div><div class=\"western\">That said, there were countless such links stretching back towards E-Rantel. Over there, he was not confident of being able to give a clear order without speaking it. That much was true. However, Ainz had made very few undead in this place, so issuing a clear-cut command would be simple enough.</div><div class=\"western\">\u2015<i>Disappear. Now then, to return to Nazarick for a while\u2026</i></div><div class=\"western\">After this would come a very frightening task \u2015 a task of deception that had to be completed. He would have liked someone else to handle it if he could, but that was impossible, Besides, who could he hand it to?</div><div class=\"western\">He touched the magic items from the three demihumans on the table in the hopes of clearing away his unease.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Fufu. They\u2019re weak, they\u2019re cheap, but still, obtaining magic items in this world makes me happy\u2026 well, maybe I\u2019m not as happy as Pandora\u2019s Actor would be, but it does feel like I enjoy magic items too, huh?</i></div><div class=\"western\">The first thing he did was appraise the magic items belonging to the four-armed demihuman. Among them, was the armband that had protected against Ainz\u2019s instant death spell, and its name was the Deathguard Armband. It could grant immunity to death magic once a day.</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz picked it up and twirled it in his hand several times, then put it back on the table.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Boring. If only there were better items. Now then\u2015</i></div><div class=\"western\">Just as he was about to set out, he heard the sound of knocking on the door. A voice from the outside said, \u201cYour Majesty, this is Neia Baraja.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz immediately inspected himself. Then he looked around the room to ensure that his bearing was that of the absolute sovereign that was the Sorcerer King. After that, he slowly settled himself into a chair and the pose he adopted was King Ainz No. 24.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2015Enter.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">He did his best to speak in a low, weighty voice. This change in pitch was also the result of repeated practice.</div><div class=\"western\">The door opened, and Neia \u2015 her injuries now recovered \u2015 entered the room and bowed to him.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI am deeply grateful to be granted permission to enter, Your Highness. I have come here in order to discharge my duties as a squire.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cUmu. I am glad you came, Miss Baraja. But there is no need to fulfill your squire\u2019s obligations today. While your wounds might have healed, the fatigue of the battle must\u2015\u201d</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Ah, it\u2019s been taken care of,</i> Ainz thought. The potion he had used back then was one which removed both fatigue and exhaustion. It was a potion that Nfirea \u2015 his skin dry and rough \u2015 had praised to the heavens.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI am able to fulfil my obligations as a squire thanks to Your Majesty\u2019s power. Also \u2015 I am very happy to be allowed to stay by Your Majesty\u2019s side.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Neia smiled \u2015 or was it a smirk? One\u2019s body would naturally go on the defensive in the face of a hostile or evil smile, but Ainz\u2019s kingly poise was unbreakable.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201c\u2026Is that so? However, I must return to the Sorcerous Kingdom for a while to handle some critical tasks. I apologize for wasting your trip.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI see\u2026\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">She looked very sad, but she did not look cute at all. All he could think was that she was glaring at him. However, Ainz had already thought of a way to deal with Neia.</div><div class=\"western\">All he had to do was close his eyes. That way, her eyes would not frighten him any more.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cSpeaking of which, I am glad that you are well \u2015 that you are alive, Miss Baraja.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThank you very much, Your Majesty! All this is thanks to your power. In particular, without this suit of armor I might not have been able to hold out until Your Majesty arrived.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\"><i>But you didn\u2019t hold out, you died\u2026 well, all\u2019s well that ends well. Come to think of it, I heard she was fighting on the city walls, so giving her that armor which could defend against ranged attacks was the right choice!</i></div><div class=\"western\">\u201cFufu. Well, that is good to hear. How about the bow? Did you show off its power to the masses?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYes\u2026 many people saw the the amazing power of this bow\u2026 although, they\u2019re all dead now.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cWhat!? \u2015I see, so that\u2019s what happened. What a shame.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">He had failed again. Ainz was filled with a profound sense of regret. If everyone who saw it was dead, it was no different from nobody seeing it at all. <i>Maybe I should give up on trying to promote rune weapons,</i> Ainz thought. <i>Still \u2015 I think there ought to be more chances for it. Even if this plan fails, it doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ve lost anything, and there\u2019ll be great benefits if it succeeds.</i></div><div class=\"western\">\u201cI am sure that without the gear which Your Majesty lent me, I would be in Heaven with the others\u2026 thank you very much, Your Majesty.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz sensed that her words came from the heart, and so Ainz thought, <i>Well done</i>. Of course, he could not express that emotion. He had to keep showing her a ruler\u2019s poise, after all.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cPay it no heed. All you need to know is that a master\u2019s duty is to protect his followers.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Ainz cracked his eyes open a fraction to study her reaction. Neia\u2019s face had twisted slightly when she had heard the word \u201cfollower.\u201d It was probably not anger, but it felt like some kind of unhappiness. If her present attitude and the flow of the conversation were to be trusted, that was not the case.</div><div class=\"western\">In other words, opening his eyes had been a mistake. Ainz closed his eyes again.</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cThank you very much, Your Majesty. Also, the people whom Your Majesty saved also wish me to express their gratitude to you.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cHo\u2026\u201d <i>All right!</i> Ainz struggled to hide the way he felt. \u201cYou need not worry about it. I simply happened to save them because they were there. However, I hope they will not expect this good fortune to repeat itself, I used quite a lot of mana in this battle, so I might not be able to help next time, you know?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cUnderstood, I will convey your message to them.\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cAhh. However\u2026 that\u2019s right. Please inform these people that I am glad to receive their gratitude\u2026 and now, Miss Baraja, I apologize but I really must be going. After this \u2015 yes, can you come back in four hours\u2019 time?\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">\u201cYes! No problem at all! Then, please excuse me, Your Majesty!\u201d</div><div class=\"western\">Neia left the room, and Ainz opened his eyes.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>Hm. Her gratitude does seem quite genuine. Looks like I\u2019ve got one person at last. No, as the saying goes, a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Should I give out free healing potions as advertisement? That ought to win me more gratitude\u2026 but can it make up for the mistake with the rune weapons?</i></div><div class=\"western\">Ainz took out the purple potion.</div><div class=\"western\">This was Nfirea\u2019s potion. Its quality was slightly inferior to that of YGGDRASIL-made potions, and it was still in the development phase. However, its effects might catch up in the future, or he might end up being able to make YGGDRASIL\u2019s red potions.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>It would have been too wasteful to spread the news of YGGDRASIL\u2019s red potions for nothing, so I didn\u2019t use them\u2026 still, I don\u2019t know whether people who are used to blue potions can accept purple potions. Using them here and collecting the results sounds like a good plan.</i></div><div class=\"western\">Right now, he intended to have Nazarick conceal the potions which Nfirea and his grandmother had made. He did not plan to distribute the technology. However, that plan might change in the future, and the time might come when he could sell that potion. It would be good to prime the pump for such a situation.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>This is complicated. There\u2019s merits and demerits on both sides\u2026</i></div><div class=\"western\"><i>Frankly speaking, the fact that he\u2019s discussing his sex life with me is causing me a lot of problems. I mean, at least they\u2019re not doing it in front of me, but wouldn\u2019t it be bad if word got out that he was talking about his wife?</i></div><div class=\"western\"><i>In the first place, why is Nfirea even discussing this with me? Is it because he has no male relatives and is far away from the city he had lived in until now, so he thought that he had nobody to talk to? For all I know, he might be thinking that Narberal and I have that sort of relationship.</i></div><div class=\"western\"><i>But he ought to know that I\u2019m a skeleton\u2026</i></div><div class=\"western\">While Ainz had thought of spying on the two of them at night to satisfy his curiosity, he felt that doing so would change his attitude towards the two of them, so he had curbed the impulse. However, it took a great deal of effort to shake off the curiosity that flashed through his mind every time Nfirea came to discuss it with him.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>I remember something about it feeling very good, so he was asked to do it a lot of times\u2026 could it be that the reason he made so much of that potion \u2015 some kind of nutrient supplement, I think \u2015 and then gave it to me was because\u2026</i></div><div class=\"western\">In any case, he had decided to give it to those two Lizardmen so they would work hard on making more rare children.</div><div class=\"western\"><i>The fruits of technology are first applied to the military, then sex and medicine. Is that true? \u2026Ah, time to go back.</i></div></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/overlord-ln-chapter-91-volume-12\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 91 - Volume 12\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/overlord-ln-chapter-93-volume-13\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 93 - Volume 13\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"172197\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

He could not help but smile. Could it be that he had become sentimental after leaving the Wilderness?</p><br/><p>When he thought back, he realized that it had been a few months since he had left the Wilderness, and he had indeed changed tremendously.</p><br/><p>He could fall asleep in peace instead of hiding in a corner while clutching a sword. He could accept people within close proximity without the desire to kill them to get rid of any possible threats. He could leisurely talk to Lou Lan and gaze at the stars while lying on the rattan chair instead of constantly having his guard up against any potential danger.</p><br/><p>He did not know if these changes were good or bad, but for now, he was not going to reject them.</p><br/><p>If this type of life were to continue, he would, in fact, be very happy.</p><br/><p>He suddenly came across Teacher Xu along the way, whose face revealed a look of pride. \u201cStudent Ai Hui, you have improved a lot. To be able to open the natal residence in such a short period, you must have put in tremendous efforts. Keep up the good work.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Teacher.\u201d Ai Hui gave a courteous bow.</p><br/><p>He truly respected the teachers of his school, because in his opinion, imparting knowledge was a very noble deed. It was exceedingly difficult to learn things in the Wilderness, as everyone had something to do and seldom were there people who were willing to use their precious time to help you. Not to mention that none of them cared to see if he had learned anything.</p><br/><p>Initially, Teacher Xu was worried about Ai Hui\u2019s poor track record, but upon observing Ai Hui\u2019s base level, he knew that Ai Hui did not neglect his studies. Still, he instructed Ai Hui earnestly, \u201cAfter opening your natal residence, you have more things to learn. Compared to others, your basics are much weaker. You must not slack off.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will work hard, Teacher,\u201d Ai Hui replied, showing his thanks.</p><br/><p>Teacher Xu nodded. \u201cI am relieved that you think that way. You must live harmoniously with your classmates. Some classmates might be easily irritated and have a bad attitude, but their intentions are good. To be able to open the natal residence so quickly, I am sure you have had such experiences before.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui was confused. What did Teacher Xu mean by saying this? Was it to get him to avoid conflicts with his classmates?</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, he nodded respectfully. \u201cI will remember this, Teacher.\u201d</p><br/><p>Teacher Xu was very pleased with Ai Hui\u2019s attitude. A respectful and diligent student would naturally be a good student. His vast teaching experience had enabled him to interact with many students. It did not matter if the basics were weak, as they can be learned gradually. As long as the students were equipped with a good attitude, then there would be an improvement. Since such students would not take shortcuts, they would have firm foundations. While it would be difficult for them to become a prominent hero in their own way, they would be able to be the backbone of the Avalon of Five Elements.</p><br/><p>\u201cPreviously, I did not mention this to you as you had yet to open your natal residence. The school has many activities that you should actively participate in to expand your boundaries. After a period of time, all of you will have missions to execute. These would be considered as practical lessons and also as part of the assessments from the school,\u201d Teacher Xu patiently said.</p><br/><p>\u201cStudents have to go on missions, too?\u201d Ai Hui was somewhat surprised.</p><br/><p>Teacher Xu laughed. \u201cOf course. All of you are here to learn skills at the Induction Ground. What\u2019s the point of learning but not utilizing? You don\u2019t have to worry too much. The missions would be easy in the beginning and only grow harder when your abilities become stronger. In the future, all of you will meet with various scenarios which would be more complicated and dangerous. More practice would be beneficial.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will do my best, Teacher,\u201d Ai Hui answered seriously.</p><br/><p>Teacher Xu was finished with his preaching and told Ai Hui, \u201cGo for your lessons.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Ai Hui\u2019s retreating back, Teacher Xue felt a little rueful. Ai Hui\u2019s situation was the most unusual in his class. A laborer who did not manage to open his natal residence actually managed to stay in the Wilderness for three years and also come out alive. Truth be told, he could hardly imagine what Ai Hui had gone through in the past three years and how he had managed to stay alive.</p><br/><p>Teacher Xue had always disliked and opposed the Avalon of Five Elements\u2019 recruitment of laborers from the Old Territory. However, he was not influential enough to change anything.</p><br/><p>When he first saw Ai Hui, he saw a thirst in Ai Hui\u2019s eyes\u2014a thirst for knowledge. To a teacher, there was nothing more touching than this.</p><br/><p>Therefore, he personally made a trip to find Duanmu Huanghun to request him to help Ai Hui.</p><br/><p>At present, it appeared that Duanmu Huanghun did a good job. He was aware of Ai Hui\u2019s aptitude. For Ai Hui to be able to open his natal residence in such a short amount of time, without a doubt, it must have been Duanmu Huanghun\u2019s doing.</p><br/><p>Teacher Xu was very pleased with his own decision. He had no qualms about Duanmu Huanghun\u2019s gifts and capability. The splendid results from his previous military battles proved everything.</p><br/><p>By helping Ai Hui, Duanmu Huanghun showcased his responsibility and compassionate heart. This made Teacher Xu delighted.</p><br/><p>His gaze soon fell upon the walking Duanmu Huanghun.</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun also noticed Teacher Xu and hurriedly bowed. \u201cTeacher Xu!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you recovered from your injuries?\u201d Teacher Xu concernedly asked, before continuing immediately in a reproachful tone, \u201cStudent Duanmu, in the future, please do not be so competitive. While rankings may be significant, your body is of the utmost importance. You are still young and have a long way to go. Do not place too much emphasis on these useless rankings. Look at you, you pushed yourself over your limits which resulted in taking a month to recover. Do not do such things in future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will heed your teachings, Teacher. Huanghun will definitely not make such rash decisions in future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun hastily, yet politely replied. He felt a pang of guilt in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour talent is excellent, given that you achieved a lot at a young age and I am not worried about your training. I am more concerned about your moral ethics.\u201d Teacher Xu looked solemn. With a stern tone, he continued, \u201cNo matter how exceptional a person is, without a good character, it will ruin everything. Just like previously, there was actually a student running naked in public. When that happened, it was humiliating for the entire Central Pine Academy. This has brought about much fury, and we are determined to uncover what happened. No matter how powerful the person\u2019s background is, once the truth is revealed, we will definitely not let him off! Eh? Student Duanmu, why are you perspiring so badly?\u201d</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun had started to look increasingly guilty. He forced out a laugh. \u201cI guess I have not fully recovered, and my body is still weak.\u201d</p><br/><p>With a voice laced with concern, Teacher Xu immediately advised, \u201cYou have to be mindful of your body. Do let me know if you need anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will.\u201d Duanmu Huanghun could not wait to flee from this conversation.</p><br/><p>Teacher Xu then complimented him by saying, \u201cDuanmu, you were very responsible. I didn\u2019t think that you could attain such an outstanding accomplishment. Given that Student Ai Hui could open his natal residence in such a short period of time, the credit must definitely go to you. Initially, I was worried that both of your characters would clash, but it looks like I am thinking too much. The two of you have been long-term partners, and it looks like both of you have pretty good synergy. Not bad. Since we are doing group activities today, the two of you shall be in the same group. Okay, time to go for lessons.\u201d</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun was initially baffled. It took forever for him to react after Teacher Xu had finished speaking.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui\u2026\u2026and I in the same group?</p><br/><p>Oh no!</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun clutched his head with both hands as he looked at Teacher Xu\u2019s retreating back. His face was filled with terror.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

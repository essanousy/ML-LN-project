Other than the breaths of the ardent flower night wolves and the soldiers petting them to pacify it, the whole campground was solemn.</p><br/><p>Xing Shan managed the military strictly, but whatever War God Ye said, he would complete wholeheartedly. He, too, would do that. Military order was strict, and anyone who dared defy his instructions would be killed on the spot and without hesitation. On the other hand, he knew how to coax his subordinates. Whenever there were money making opportunities, he would bring everyone along instead of hogging everything for himself.</p><br/><p>He was born in the marketplace and was very practical and tactful. He knew that flattering and fawning hadn\u2019t the least bit of use. Those who led the team well and were loyal and devoted to him would be rewarded immediately and given important posts. That way, subordinates felt it to be rather fair.</p><br/><p>As time passed, people were convinced of this boss\u2019 leadership. Boss appeared rough, but he was actually a complex person and not someone to be fooled easily.</p><br/><p>Xing Shan leaned on his Chieftain Wolf and sprawled on the floor with his eyes slightly shut as if he was resting. He was lightly stroking the wolf\u2019s fur with his palm. This ardent flower night wolf was his saddle horse. It was extremely spirited, but also hot-tempered.</p><br/><p>In the beginning, Xing Shan suffered some hardships when dealing with the Chieftain Wolf. He was extremely frustrated, but he couldn\u2019t bear to slaughter it. With much effort, he finally managed to tame it.</p><br/><p>They had a very close relationship, and the Chieftain Wolf had saved his life repeatedly. In Xing Shan\u2019s eyes, no one in the whole of the Ardent Flower Blood Division was comparable to his Chieftain Wolf.</p><br/><p>With his Chieftain Wolf\u2019s ability, this long-range raid wasn\u2019t a big deal. The Chieftain Wolf enjoyed Xing Shan\u2019s caresses and yawned occasionally. With his eyes shut, XIng Shan was deep in thought.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know why, but he started to feel ill at ease, which disturbed him, because he had met with danger the previous time he felt this way.</p><br/><p>This was an omen, he thought.</p><br/><p>He sorted recent affairs carefully but couldn\u2019t find anything amiss.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, he felt that something wasn\u2019t right and jerked his eyes open.</p><br/><p>A dazzling light ray lit up in the faraway sky, its intense wave motion alarming Xing Shan. Such a strong motion could only be due to a confrontation between two powerful players. Was there a powerful figure?</p><br/><p>The whole camp had been startled. Everybody stood up and looked toward the ray in bewilderment.</p><br/><p>A short while later, an obvious air flow swept across the campground, and Xing Shan\u2019s face changed.</p><br/><p>This was the shockwave from that earlier collision. From amid the wind, he captured Zu Chun\u2019s aura of blood spiritual force!</p><br/><p>Quite a few people had detected this. Having interacted with Zu Chun day and night, many of them were familiar with his blood spiritual force\u2019s aura. If it had been any other day, no one would be too worried, since in the Ardent Flower Blood Division, Zu Chun\u2019s ability was second only to Boss Xing Shan. Yet that wave motion was simply too intense. Zu Chun must have met a Master elementalist!</p><br/><p>Xing Shan\u2019s face was ashen-colored. Zu Chun was his right-hand man and Xing Shan relied heavily on him. Zu Chun had always been the one in charge of daily training, and even after so many years, he\u2019d never failed to live up to Xing Shan\u2019s expectations.</p><br/><p>He quickly suppressed his anger, his mind spinning rapidly. Xing Shan had secured his position as the division leader not only because of his own capability.</p><br/><p>He originally planned to seek out the location of the Spear of Heavy Cloud first. He hadn\u2019t expected to scout out the opponent so quickly, and a Master elementalist at that.</p><br/><p>The enemy was very close!</p><br/><p>Xing Shan\u2019s expression worsened with this realization. The distance between them was much shorter than he\u2019d expected. This meant that the enemy was positioned even more aggressively and invasively and was more ambitious.</p><br/><p>While he didn\u2019t know which combat division his opponent was from, he knew that the three teams that cooperated and claimed victory previously had no reason to battle separately. If they wanted to join forces, they could not be too far apart.</p><br/><p>After analyzing, Xing Shan realized that they were in a very dangerous situation!</p><br/><p>The Ardent Flower Blood Division could be attacked from all sides.</p><br/><p>Xing Shan calmed down. He was aware that whether or not the opponent was from Shi Xueman\u2019s combat division, he would have to use the power of lightning to attack and prevent getting closed in on three sides.</p><br/><p>Any hesitation in the face of such an encounter could lead to a catastrophe.</p><br/><p>In a battle encounter, both parties were usually unprepared. Many would wait for the right opportunity in hope that they could be more amply prepared, but retreating and hesitating was like bowing and giving away victory.</p><br/><p>\"Get ready, army! We\u2019re setting off shortly!\"</p><br/><p>Xing Shan roared before turning over and sitting on his wolf.</p><br/><p>Everybody responded loudly as they got up in succession and sat on ardent flower night wolves.</p><br/><p>They transformed into a deluge and whizzed toward that dazzling light.</p><br/><p>Shi Xueman was in the tent, summing up her insights.</p><br/><p>If they had a God-subduing Peak and installed a pagoda cannon at its crucial position, it would be alarmingly powerful. She put pen to paper and in the blink of an eye an outline of God-subduing Peak appeared.</p><br/><p>She\u2019d been stationed in one before, so she was very familiar with it. Propping her chin, she fixed her eyes on the drawing and quickly marked out a suitable position for the pagoda cannon to be installed.</p><br/><p>A mighty force like a Hellfire Pagoda Cannon was very well-suited to a heavy weapon like a God-subduing Peak.</p><br/><p>A Hellfire Pagoda Cannon could double the power of a God-subduing Peak and seal off a region that was more than ten times bigger. Shi Xueman was also startled by her deductions. Any tripling or quintupling of power of a heavy weapon was already considered remarkable.</p><br/><p>A tenfold increase was completely unbelievable.</p><br/><p>Shi Xueman never would\u2019ve thought that such a small Hellfire Pagoda Cannon could cause such a huge change.</p><br/><p>What else would a God-subduing Peak need if it had a Hellfire Pagoda Cannon?</p><br/><p>Shi Xueman was very aware that a God-subduing Peak wasn\u2019t without its flaws. The Wall of North Sea wouldn\u2019t have collapsed otherwise.</p><br/><p>And her father wouldn\u2019t have\u2026</p><br/><p>Shi Xueman pursed her lips tightly, her expression steadfast. She tried hard to dismiss her distracting thoughts. Now\u2019s not the time to feel sad and weak, she told herself.</p><br/><p>She started thinking again.</p><br/><p>She thought about the flaws of a God-subduing Peak since thinking from this angle might lead her to something.</p><br/><p>She recalled her journey to Jadeite Forest, trying hard to capture the God-subduing Peak\u2019s weaknesses.</p><br/><p>Its speed!</p><br/><p>The God-subduing Peak\u2019s speed wasn\u2019t considered slow. Elementalists would get tired from flying, but a God-subduing Peak could travel from Silver Mist Sea to Jadeite Forest without needing to stop. When it came to battles, however, it always seemed clumsy.</p><br/><p>The God-subduing Peak was too bulky and could only resist instead of dodge enemies\u2019 attacks.</p><br/><p>Enemies would throw themselves onto it like a swarm of bees, and that was when the God-subduing Peak was in greatest danger. It wouldn\u2019t be able to bear the attacks no matter how solid its defense was. If enemies managed to get close, some unique attacks would smash its tortoise shell like a heavy hammer.</p><br/><p>Some extreme blood elementalists would even self-detonate.</p><br/><p>The scene of a blood elementalist exploding was very heroic, and its impact was extremely shocking too.</p><br/><p>In the midst of killing, soldiers would usually become even more crazy, be it blood elementalists or elementalists. There wasn\u2019t any difference.</p><br/><p>A God-subduing Peak\u2019s speed and agility was difficult to change because of its bulk.</p><br/><p>How could she compensate for this flaw then?</p><br/><p>What about an even more compressed pagoda cannon? Shi Xueman immediately rejected this idea. While Hellfire Pagoda Cannons were indeed very mighty, their firing frequency was simply too slow and more suited for focused targets.</p><br/><p>A God-subduing Peak wasn\u2019t very useful when it came to dealing with this swarm battle technique.</p><br/><p>What to do?</p><br/><p>Increase the number of defending elementalists? This could be a solution. Elementalists were good at flying, so they would be able to block off approaching enemies. An inspirational flash lit across her eyes. That\u2019s right, as long as they prevented enemies from getting close to the God-subduing Peak, its might could fully be unleashed.</p><br/><p>Shi Xueman was feeling rather agitated. She was aware of the value of this idea.</p><br/><p>Quite a few God-subduing Peaks had already been created, but there were always only a few elementalists stationed around each of them. Because there weren\u2019t many battle positions onboard, there had always been few battling elementalists.</p><br/><p>But its gigantic build could definitely fit the entire combat division!</p><br/><p>They just hadn\u2019t done it, because they believed that increasing the number of elementalists on board wouldn\u2019t increase the God-subduing Peak\u2019s might.</p><br/><p>But it was as if Shi Xueman had just opened up a new window. She felt that a God-subduing Peak wasn\u2019t just an empty castle, it could actually be a beehive!</p><br/><p>A flying beehive!</p><br/><p>If they weren\u2019t able to handle the swarm battle technique, the enemies, too, wouldn\u2019t be able to.</p><br/><p>Adding a Hellfire Pagoda Cannon to a God-subduing Peak would greatly increase its lockdown region, which meant that their own soldiers would be able to get assistance from a greater area.</p><br/><p>Shi Xueman got increasingly excited and stood up abruptly, left her tent, and got ready to discuss this matter with Sang Zi Jun, Jiang Wei, and the rest.</p><br/><p>This was their daily activity \u2013 non-stop pondering and discussing. From the start of the blood catastrophe, Ai Hui had been the one to host the discussions, and this tradition never stopped since then.</p><br/><p>Shi Xueman, who had just walked out of the tent, turned rigid. She raised her head and looked at the dazzling light ray at the horizon.</p><br/><p>That was\u2026 Zu Yan\u2019s elemental energy wave motion!</p><br/><p>Zu Yan must have met an extremely remarkable blood elementalist!</p><br/><p>Zu Yan was very capable. Although he had become a Master a little later than usual, his abilities in the Spear of Heavy Cloud was second only to Shi Xueman\u2019s. He was a even notch better than Yang Xiaodong. Such a violent impact could only be due to an encounter with a powerful blood elementalist.</p><br/><p>An enemy was here!</p><br/><p>And they were already very close by.</p><br/><p>\"Get ready for battle!\"</p><br/><p>Without needing for her to shout, members of the Spear of Heavy Cloud were already alarmed. The elemental energy wave motion was simply too intense.</p><br/><p>\"Gather the troops quickly, Wang Xiaoshan. An enemy is here.\"</p><br/><p>\"Get ready to face the enemy head-on, Jiang Wei.\"</p><br/><p>\"Get someone to inform the Sky Edge soldiers that the enemy is here, Sang Zijun.\"</p><br/><p>\"Follow me, Yang Xiaodong. We\u2019re going to save them!\"</p><br/><p>The azure wings on Shi Xueman spread open with a jolt and she soared into the sky.</p><br/><p>Not daring to lag behind, Yang Xiaodong quickly followed behind.</p><br/><p>Jiang Wei fixed his gaze on their silhouettes, clenching his fists. The more dangerous the situation was, the usefulness of a Master became more apparent.</p><br/><p>This battle encounter occurred too suddenly, and everyone was caught off guard. Yet none panicked, since they already had a contingency plan. From top to bottom, everybody was working in an organized manner.</p><br/><p>The camping ground was in full swing as everyone was operating at full speed, like precise gears.</p><br/><p>The courageous reigned supreme!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

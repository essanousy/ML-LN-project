Unfortunately, this happened only after his numbness disappeared, allowing the pain to intensify.</p><br/><p>If it was not for the fact that he was used to the pricking pain from his stay in the Suspending Golden Pagoda, he would have been shrieking miserably and endlessly.</p><br/><p>His time in the pagoda had trained him to better endure agony like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour stamina is quite impressive, huh.\u201d The old man was amazed. Ever since this prototype was created, he had been the only test subject. He had experienced the pain from the fire attribute armor. His ghostly howls and wails gave an assistant teacher such a shock that he lost control and threw the operating compass far away.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Ai Hui had yet to make any sounds so far. He was indeed a wild beast in human form, one who managed to survive the Wilderness!</p><br/><p>The old man\u2019s eyes flashed. As a teacher with countless ideas, what was more important than a strong, durable disciple as a test subject? He could practically imagine how having a disciple like Ai Hui would help him to advance his theories and research by leaps and lead to substantial breakthroughs.</p><br/><p>A perfect partner to experiment with!</p><br/><p>He licked his lips as if he had seen fine delicacies as he mumbled, \u201cIncrease the intensity, elemental energy becomes more fragmented, metal elemental energy is a little foreign, no problem, try a few more times\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Thousands of heart-piercing arrows became thousands of ants devouring Ai Hui\u2019s body and he began to tremble.</p><br/><p>The old man was a good example of what would happen if decades of accumulated passion was released all at once. He had a frenzied gaze, was muttering to himself as he stared at the operating compass in his hand, and unceasingly adjusted the armor\u2019s elemental energy while looking at the luster of the copper armor.</p><br/><p>As he fiddled with the remote, the copper armor illuminated as well.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui felt as if he had fallen into hell and into the eighteenth level no less.</p><br/><p>The elemental energy stimulating his body was constantly changing. Numb, itchy, painful, hot, sore, and so on\u2026 all kinds of different sensations appeared in different parts of his body.</p><br/><p>Before today, no, before putting on the armor, he had never imagined that metal elemental energy had so many permutations. Every variation happened without any warning.</p><br/><p>That feeling was simply\u2026 such a painful revelation.</p><br/><p>Beneath the teacher\u2019s messy hair, his eyes were fervent and focused.</p><br/><p>The light on the armor kept changing, and he stood by the side taking notes with each transition while saying words and terms that Ai Hui had no knowledge of.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui had no other thoughts at this point. He just wanted this purgatory experiment to end as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>This set of copper armor had no practical value. Ai Hui acknowledged that his endurance level was higher than average, but a few times he had almost passed out and a few times his mind went blank. He suspected that students with slightly weaker constitutions would be in danger. Even if it was not physically hazardous, it would be traumatizing and would become a mental block that hindered future training.</p><br/><p>What an extreme product\u2026</p><br/><p>This thought floated across his mind, but what he focused more on was his admiration for his teacher.</p><br/><p>Although the entire process was like a tortuous purge, to the point where dying was a better choice, Ai Hui felt the potential of the procedure.</p><br/><p>Even the many minute differences within the metal elemental energy were individually amazing!</p><br/><p>Ai Hui had a very strong feeling that even if this test produced negligible results, his interaction with so many different kinds of metal elemental energy would be considerably beneficial for future trainings.</p><br/><p>If he had not experienced it once for himself, he would be absolutely ignorant of the slight differences within the energies. They were all metal elemental energies, but each had subtle distinctions which would reveal their entirely unique nature.</p><br/><p>Metal elemental energy had an overall character, but contained respective variations as well.</p><br/><p>The teacher\u2019s knowledge ran deep.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui knew that when it came to principles like these, he would not be able to achieve any result just by fumbling about on his own.</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, an intense wave passed over his natal residences. At this point, the old man raised his head. \u201cLet\u2019s test your five residences and eight palaces to see which ones are stronger and which are weaker.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui was stunned. It was the first time he had heard that some of the five residences and eight palaces were stronger than others.</p><br/><p>As if he had read Ai Hui\u2019s mind, the old man started to explain, \u201cTeachers do not usually lecture about this. It is more complicated since there are so many students and plenty of problems involved. You just have to think about it this way. Some people are right-handed while others are left-handed. Some were born with a stronger and more agile left leg. The human body is balanced yet unbalanced. The same goes for the five residences and eight palaces. Some would be stronger and others would be weaker. This used to be a heritage secret in some influential families, but now it\u2019s widespread. Those families were amazing, and the research they have completed was so thorough. Knowing the strengths and weaknesses of your palaces would be very advantageous for your subsequent training sessions.\u201d</p><br/><p>Comprehension flashed across Ai Hui\u2019s face. What the old man had said made a lot of sense and was very convincing.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour opened natal elemental residence is not bad since you only broke through after filling up your elemental energy. As I have said before, waiting is beneficial since it allows your natal elemental residence to stabilize. Most people, however, do not have the patience.\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man spoke while he tinkered with the operating compass.</p><br/><p>Shortly, a ball of bright light lit up in Ai Hui\u2019s left palm.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot bad, the palace in your left hand is not bad at all. It\u2019s a strong palace.\u201d</p><br/><p>Soon, another ball of bright light appeared in his right palm.</p><br/><p>\u201cPalace in the right hand is a strong one as well. Not bad eh, there is balance in your hands and some moves can only be learned if there\u2019s balance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe palace in the left foot is a strong one!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my, the palace in the right foot is also strong. Balanced legs and all limbs are balanced!\u201d the old man commented in bewilderment, face full of excitement. \u201cSon, you have a flair for combat! Balanced limbs\u2026 perfect reptile eh. I know a few extremely powerful moves which require coordination of the limbs. Two hundred years ago, the leader of the Infantry Division, Wu Yan, possessed precisely this balance of strong palaces in every limb. Know what his nickname was?Iron Octopus! Hahaha, you\u2019re indeed my disciple.\u201d</p><br/><p>Reptile\u2026</p><br/><p>Ai Hui did not know what to say but\u2026 it sounded fearsome? Still, adding the word \u201ciron\u201d in front of \u201coctopus\u201d did not make it sound any fiercer at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cStrong earth palace!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStrong sea palace!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGate palace is strong! Ah ah ah ah son, if your sky palace is strong, you\u2019re invincible! A body full of strong palaces! Absolutely awesome! No points of weakness! A perfect five residences and eight palaces! Know what this is called? Hegemon of the palaces!\u201d</p><br/><p>The sky palace was located between the eyebrows. Looking at how agitated his teacher was becoming, Ai Hui was also excited. Hegemon of the palaces! It sounded domineering, but... why did he think about rape... (The chinese words for \u201cHegemon of the palaces\u201d sounds like an abbreviation for a chinese idiom which means \u201cto force oneself upon somebody; to rape\u201d)</p><br/><p>A body full of strong palaces was more pleasing to hear.</p><br/><p>\u201cSky palace, sky palace, it must be a strong palace\u2026 eh?\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man stopped suddenly as he stared blankly at Ai Hui\u2019s helmet.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He flew into the sky and made a major turn halfway. The deflection was very large, like a bat gliding in low altitude.</p><br/><p>Zu Yan accumulated all the strength in his body and directed it to his heavy leg, but he still missed.</p><br/><p>The earth elementalist made a bizarre arc and appeared behind Zu Yan.</p><br/><p>The moment he landed, Zu Yan\u2019s muscles seemed to have tensed. Both of them watching were seasoned battlers, and upon seeing Zu Yan\u2019s slight movement, they knew it was getting serious.</p><br/><p>The earth elementalist sprung up from the ground, and his back struck Zu Yan.</p><br/><p>They promptly saw Zu Yan turn into an afterimage as he flew out of their field of vision like a rubber ball shooting upwards from a seesaw. The wood elementalist controlling the mirage bean pod was obviously shocked by this scene. The scene was frozen still for a good few seconds before the wood elementalist regained control of his senses and redirected the mirage bean pod.</p><br/><p>In between the light and shadow of the mirage bean pod, Zu Yan\u2019s body could be seen stuck to the light cover like a baked flatbread.</p><br/><p>\u201cMust be painful,\u201d Zhou Xiaoxi commented, as he looked lifelessly at the flatbread man in the image and swallowed his saliva with a little bit of difficulty.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it doesn\u2019t hurt.\u201d Li Wei shook his head with a similar dull expression. \u201cHe\u2019s unconscious; he can\u2019t feel a thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Snap! The light and shadow image disappeared from the nepenthes cage.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026. that\u2019s it?\u201d Zhou Xiaoxi, who had just regained his senses, fell into a daze once again. Two seconds later, a mournful shriek loud enough to tear the roof apart sounded out. \u201cNot one minute\u2019s up and it\u2019s already over? Where\u2019s the absolute art? I can\u2019t even see his face clearly! Earth elementalist? Where\u2019s the sand puppet? Where are the other people? That\u2019s all? How dare you sell the tickets at a hundred thousand yuan for this kind of show? Ahhhhhh\u2026I\u2019m gonna kill somebody! Don\u2019t stop me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA hundred thousand?\u201d Li Wei looked disdainfully at Zhou Xiaoxi and did not forget to rub it in. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you have assets in terms of face and body, but money? I know you do! And brains? None for sure!\u201d</p><br/><p>Pfff. A puff of mist exited the nepenthes, releasing a burp-like sound that seemed to give an affirmation to Li Wei\u2019s words. \u201cLight-swallowing, shadow-spitting\u201d nepenthes sounded like a mighty name but it was actually a very simple type of plant\u2014its most unique trait was that it wasn\u2019t picky about food.</p><br/><p>When the wood elementalists first bred the mirage bean pod, they found an awkward fact\u2014the smell of the bean was rejected by all flora and fauna.</p><br/><p>The initial test subject was a colorful chameleon. Its skin could spray out multicolored light, creating an illusion around its surroundings to protect itself. But the experiment had quickly failed because the chameleon was badly poisoned after eating the bean.</p><br/><p>Images stored inside the movie bean were screened successfully only after the wood elementalists had discovered a special kind of nepenthes. This was how it was given such an imperious name.</p><br/><p>The two of them briefly stood in silence, digesting the scene from earlier.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s finally a powerful fellow but he turns out to be an earth elementalist. How unexpected.\u201d Zhou Xiaoxi was disappointed as the North Sea was recruiting water elementalists.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pity there\u2019s no sand puppet.\u201d Li Wei was curious. \u201cAn earth elementalist good at battling close-range\u2026I really wonder how his sand puppet would be like.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seasoned fighters like them knew that in order to evaluate an earth elementalist, they would have to understand his sand puppet. The sand puppet was the real trump card.</p><br/><p>One must not judge a wood elementalist\u2019s battling abilities before assessing his sand puppet.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was a mid-air direction switch, eh?\u201d Zhou Xioaxi was slightly uncertain. \u201cRecognize the move yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>Between the two of them, although Li Wei looked a little more forthright, their personalities were completely opposite. Zhou Xiaoxi had a carefree personality while Li Wei was more meticulous in nature.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Li Wei shook his head. \u201cDoing a mid-air switch is possible, albeit difficult. Don\u2019t forget that he\u2019s an earth elementalist. He has a sand puppet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReasonable.\u201d Zhou Xiaoxi lightly touched his chin before asking, \u201cDon\u2019t you feel that the back leaning move was similar to [Arching Fish Back]?\u201d</p><br/><p>Actually, when he had first seen that move, Li Wei had immediately thought about the series of dents on the wall of the Suspending Golden Pagoda. Could it be Ai Hui? This idea flashed through his mind before he quickly shook it off. Although his build matched the dents, he had just activated his natal residence. It was impossible for him to possess such combat strength.</p><br/><p>Plus, this was an earth elementalist. Ai Hui, on the other hand, was definitely of the metal attribute.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m more willing to believe that it\u2019s [Back to the Mountain],\u201d Li Wei said.</p><br/><p>Zhou Xiaoxi understood; although the earth elementalist\u2019s move seemed to be similar to [Arching Fish Back], the power released far exceeded that of it.</p><br/><p>[Arching Fish Back] was a technique that was used for struggling free instead of attacking.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are all kinds of freaks this year. How can an earth elementalist be an earth elementalist if he doesn\u2019t engage his sand puppet when fighting?\u201d Zhou Xiaoxi mumbled to himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoungsters nowadays are fierce!\u201d Li Wei sighed. Zu Yan\u2019s performance was already pretty solid but that earth elementalist\u2019s abilities were even more outstanding. The disparity between levels could be made up with time but a gap between talent wasn\u2019t something that could be easily filled.</p><br/><p>Li Wei did not know why, but after viewing the movie bean, he all the more yearned to urgently recruit Ai Hui.</p><br/><p>He felt that Ai Hui was undoubtedly the most suitable fellow for the Infantry Division!</p><br/><p>What should he do?</p><br/><p>Li Wei decided that no matter what, he had to meet Ai Hui personally before thinking further.</p><br/><p>The embroidery workshop.</p><br/><p>As usual, Mingxiu was reporting to her teacher. The workshop had received many orders of different priorities; some were urgent while others could wait. Some required her teacher to attend to personally while others could be taken care of by Mingxiu. She organized and handled the tasks well; Han Yuqin was extremely reassured and satisfied with this beloved disciple of hers.</p><br/><p>After listening to Mingxiu\u2019s report, Han Yuqin asked about Ai Hui. \u201cHow\u2019s your junior doing recently?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot much progress.\u201d Mingxiu shook her head, and she hesitated a little before continuing, \u201cI\u2019m afraid that Twilight Silk\u2019s too difficult for him. It\u2019s not easy even for me. Should we change it to something else?\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Yuqin hesitated as well. Mingxiu didn\u2019t seem to be exaggerating.</p><br/><p>Unlike what Ai Hui thought, Twilight Silk was not sold in the market at an extremely high price because of the rarity of twilight silkworm cocoons. In fact, twilight silkworm cocoons were really cheap. They were resistant to water and fire, as solid as iron, and not many insects liked nibbling on them. Herbal medicine used to treat the cocoons were not worth much either.</p><br/><p>Actually, it was so pricey because it was too difficult to collect.</p><br/><p>The silk spinner had to have sufficiently pure elemental energy to solidify the gluey natural silk. Furthermore, a very stable and precise control of elemental energy was needed. Any slight disturbance in concentration would cause the silk to break.</p><br/><p>Once the silk was broken, it couldn\u2019t be joined back\u2014this meant that it was impossible to make a long silk strand from many short ones.</p><br/><p>And the whole process was time consuming and produced little output. Whenever Han Yuqin needed it, she would purchase it directly instead of producing it on her own.</p><br/><p>To be fair, Han Yuqin also felt that Twilight Silk was too difficult for Ai Hui.</p><br/><p>But to change it?</p><br/><p>Thinking about this, she couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cHow does Ai Hui feel about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>After all, she was someone who had already taken in disciples. She knew that when it came to youngsters, difficult tasks would dampen their zeal.</p><br/><p>As an afterthought, Han Yuqin added, \u201cDiscuss it with him first.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

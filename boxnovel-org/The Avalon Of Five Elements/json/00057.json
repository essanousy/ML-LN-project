He suddenly saw the copper armor and noiselessly shifted himself a bit further away from it.</p><br/><p>The previous experience was simply so miserable that even a guy like Ai Hui, who had a steel heart full of determination, was traumatized.</p><br/><p>The old man did not notice Ai Hui\u2019s subtle movement. He was busy elaborating on his analysis of the results.</p><br/><p>\u201c... low aptitude and a lower affinity between your body and elemental energy are actually not bad things. Other than allowing you to endure purer energy, the lower sensitivity allows you to absorb it from a wider scope. Precious racing horses, for example, are gifted but picky about food and are fed better meals than humans. A worn out, old horse like you can\u2019t run fast but can endure well and is easy to manage. You\u2019ll eat whatever grass there is and survive well. Eh? You\u2019re really eating grass!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui continued to chew on his grass sluggishly.</p><br/><p>The old man stopped his discourse and hurriedly added, \u201cGo on, go on, eat it.\u201d</p><br/><p>He went on to say, \u201cLooks like my example was really fitting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui felt weird now. Should he continue chewing or spit it out?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve tested the metal elemental energy at the Suspending Golden Pagoda, and it suits you very well. Train there in the future. As compared to your weak aptitude, your body is very strong. The effects of the tempering of your body are obvious. You\u2019re of a lower grade now, so the result is optimal. The metal elemental energy in the pagoda is of a high grade and is not something that you were supposed to touch based on your current base level. But since your body quality is the most outstanding I\u2019ve seen so far and you\u2019re good at using it, the tempering is super effective. Of course, this has something to do with the fact that the metal elemental energy in the pagoda is of a high grade. The degree of metallization is the greatest on your skin, and [Copper Skin] is already about eighty percent completed. Judging from this speed, you\u2019re about two months away from perfecting [Copper Skin].</p><br/><p>The old man exclaimed with admiration, \u201cThis is my first time seeing someone developing [Copper Skin] even before activating a single palace. How astonishing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui felt a little satisfied, knowing that he had surprised his teacher.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, the main point is still your seven strong palaces. Other than the sky palace, seven are strong and very balanced. It is an amazing gift and will come in handy especially when you\u2019re selecting the moves in future. I remember there is a technique in the Induction Ground called [Big Dipper], which only requires seven strong palaces. Although it is not an absolute art, it is still incredibly powerful and wondrous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui\u2019s eyes shone. He asked without the slightest hesitation, \u201cCan I learn it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, you can apply as long as you get into the top five thousand within the Induction Ground.\u201d The old man carried on happily, \u201cOh, you\u2019re now my disciple. You only have to fulfill one criterion, and the institution will approve your application. I\u2019ve already filed a record of our master-disciple relationship and sent it over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Top five thousand\u2026doesn\u2019t seem like much of a requirement.</p><br/><p>The old man noticed Ai Hui\u2019s expression and guessed his thoughts. \u201cDon\u2019t look down on this five thousand names. Their rankings are based on the entire Induction Ground. The best student from previous batches within Central Pine Academy barely squeezed into the top five hundred. Roughly, you\u2019d have to be amongst the top ten in the school to enter the top five thousand within the Induction Ground.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui was dumbfounded. \u201cI have to get into the top ten in Central Pine Academy to make it to the top five thousand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s correct!\u201d The old man laughed somewhat gleefully.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui realized how naive he had been. Top ten within Central Pine City seemed like a faraway goal to him.</p><br/><p>However, as if nothing had happened, he shortly asked, \u201cWhat was the training method that you talked about previously?\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man was surprised by Ai Hui\u2019s ability to adjust his mood. He did not know exactly how many setbacks Ai Hui had encountered since young\u2014such an obstacle meant nothing to him.</p><br/><p>The old man spat out a single word: \u201cEmbroidery!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEmbroidery?\u201d Ai Hui was shocked, and his face stiffened. A few moments later, he repeated lifelessly, \u201cEmbroidery? Like flower embroidery?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d The old man answered with such certainty that Ai Hui knew there was no mistake.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui stared at the old man with an unkind expression. Yes, he was his teacher, but if he was going to be so unreliable, they would have to have a proper chat.</p><br/><p>Without the slightest embarrassment, the old man asked, \u201cEmbroidery, you understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui replied with an impolite tone, \u201cYes, women\u2019s embroidery.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRigid! Superficial!\u201d The old man shook his head, full of disdain. \u201cEmbroidery takes elemental energy as the needle which threads the embroidery pattern. Is it easy? There are thick and thin threads, soft and hard leather, cotton and silk. Are the complicated patterns easy? A skilled person can control ten elemental energy needles and embroidery patterns from different places at the same time. And do you know how many elemental energy needles can the best of the best control at once?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow many?\u201d Ai Hui blurted out; he was lured by the old man\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe current record is nine hundred and forty-nine,\u201d the old man answered, his face filled with awe.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui was stunned. How in the world? He just couldn\u2019t wrap his head around it!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen present age embroidery master, Han Yuqin, embroiders with nine hundred and forty-nine elemental energy needles, it\u2019s like enveloping black clouds or a shoal of fish moving together. Multicolored embroidery threads weave together in the sky like a rainbow. That\u2019s also why her work is known as \u2018The Rainbow Embroidery.\u2019 No matter how complicated an embroidery design is, she never takes over an hour to complete it,\u201d the old man said seriously.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd the threads, do you think all of them are light? Coal thread is as fine as a strand of hair, but it is very heavy. How difficult would it be to control its movement with the light and floaty elemental energy needle? Soft silver thread is very soft, like water. Any error in power control will break it. And some leathers can only be pierced through by using elemental needles wrapped with a medicinal bag.\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man\u2019s description appealed to Ai Hui and left him speechless. He never thought that embroidery involved so much knowledge and details.</p><br/><p>\u201cLearn embroidery first and then sculpting.\u201d The old man gave his guidance. \u201cIf you can familiarize yourself with these two skills, you will definitely gain fine control over elemental energy. The more exceptional your control is, the more beneficial it is to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui was convinced. He had to admit that the old man\u2019s words were very logical.</p><br/><p>While it was a little embarrassing for a man to learn embroidery, he had no issue with it as long as he could become stronger. To say that embroidery wasn't as noble as hard labor would be utter nonsense!</p><br/><p>The old man was pleased, but he concealed it well. \u201cSmart choice! Son, you will definitely be proud of this decision in future! Don\u2019t worry, I don\u2019t speak without thinking. I made this suggestion after proper consideration.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere am I going to learn?\u201d he asked boldly; he had now set his heart on it.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, there\u2019s a workshop I\u2019m familiar with.\u201d The old man added energetically, \u201cFollow me!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

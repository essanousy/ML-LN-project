Elementalists specializing in elemental food were all focusing on research. In order to witness the legendary Tribulations, many made special trips to purchase a message bean pod, causing a rise in sales of message beans in every store.</p><br/><p>Silver Mist Sea, Pagoda of Hidden Edge.</p><br/><p>\"Was it really that magical?\" Yuchi Ba\u2019s curious voice sounded from the light cocoon.</p><br/><p>Tong Gui stood in front of the cocoon and answered respectfully, \"Yes, it was very mystical. Old Tian\u2019s old injury healed completely and while my elemental energy did not increase, I could feel my mental state becoming much more stable and concise.\"</p><br/><p>Yuchi Ba commented in praise, \"There\u2019s actually such a capable person among Ai Hui\u2019s subordinates.\"</p><br/><p>Tong Gui reported, \"Yes, he is a sand puppet named Lou Lan. I don\u2019t know which expert created him came from but he\u2019s smart and extremely talented. In Central Pine City, he kept by Ai Hui\u2019s side and was very familiar with the rest of the gang as well.\"</p><br/><p>\"Go investigate.\" Yuchi Ba said in a low voice, \"I\u2019ve not heard of a sand puppet who is such an expert at cooking elemental food. Making elemental food that triggered Tribulations, isn\u2019t he an elemental food master then? Being able to create such a powerful sand puppet, there\u2019s no way that earth elementalist is an obscure figure.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\" Tong Gui agreed. Hesitating, he asked, \"Old Ba, this Ai Hui\u2026 how and what are we going to do with him next?\"</p><br/><p>Yuchi Ba laughed. \"The rain must fall, the ladies must marry. Let him be.\"</p><br/><p>\"Ah?\" Tong Gui was stunned. So much effort had been spent on creating this situation, was he going to just let it go like this?</p><br/><p>\"Shi Xueman seeks shelter from Ai Hui and the position for the next Great Elder is vacant now. All aristocratic families are fighting hard for this position so who has the time and energy to care about him?\" Yuchi Ba\u2019s tone was filled with ridicule. \"As long as we don\u2019t take Ai Hui in as our own, all will be peaceful. Just wait, they might even try to get us involved.\"</p><br/><p>Tong Gui said urgently, \"But, the backbone of each division in Central Pine has been taken away by Ai Hui. Isn\u2019t this a messy situation? And there\u2019s Master\u2019s Glory. Is Ai Hui getting a place? If not, I\u2019m afraid many from Central Pine will not join as well. Old Ba, your humble servant has been staying in Swordsman Training Hall for a few days now, and I feel that these people are very united and have already developed the \u2018all for one, one for all\u2019 attitude.\"</p><br/><p>\"What\u2019s the rush?\" Yuchi Ba laughed again. \"The cooked meat is in the pot so where else can it go? And so what if Ai Hui and his people moved together? Where else can they go? As long as they remain in the Avalon of Five Elements, we will have our options. Since they\u2019re so adamant on seeking revenge on Blood of God, they can\u2019t rely on Jadeite Forest.\"</p><br/><p>Tong Gui\u2019s eyes lit up.</p><br/><p>\"Youngsters are often impulsive. Aren\u2019t we also seeking revenge on Blood of God? But the time just isn\u2019t right yet. Ai Hui is just a male eagle that has to be tamed, or else how is he going to listen to us? How is leading a whole bunch of people an easy task? Money, resources, inheritance\u2026 does he have them? People are practical creatures. When comradeship is obliterated, there will be nothing left after some time.\"</p><br/><p>Tong Gui nodded his head repeatedly. \"Old Ba is wise! Ai Hui can only break in and inhabit the Wilderness if he wishes to provide shelter and support for so many people.\"</p><br/><p>\"Youngsters have to be polished or how else would they understand the vastness of the world? How are the aristocratic families going to find time to care about him? They hold the same opinion that since the cooked meat is already in the pot, making a move earlier or later will yield the same result. As long as Ai Hui experiences a little setback, Central Pine City will collapse. That is when everyone will make a move. Aristocratic families are different from us. They have no interest in Ai Hui but they have their eyes on Central Pine Faction. These youngsters need a little fine-tuning.\"</p><br/><p>Yuchi Ba said leisurely, \"Don\u2019t be anxious. We have nothing but time. The fight between aristocratic families is not going to conclude any time soon.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026..</p><br/><p>A heated discussion was in progress in Swordsman Training Hall.</p><br/><p>\"Are we going to choose Aristocratic Faction or the New Citizen Faction? Right now, it seems that the new citizens are friendlier\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Before finishing, Shi Xueman interrupted by repeating Duanmu Huanghun\u2019s earlier judgments. Everyone nodded their heads in agreement as she spoke.</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun\u2019s words were convincing as they hit the nail right on the head.</p><br/><p>\"There\u2019s no need to mention the Aristocratic Faction. They\u2019re busy fighting for\u2026 the position sister Xueman discarded.\" Duanmu Huanghun sighed softly, his voice taunting. \"God-subduing Peak is so mighty that the internal strife can carry on without a problem. The New Citizen Faction deems the situation to be lacklustre. As the fights within Aristocratic Faction become fiercer, their loss will increase along with the opportunities available to the New Citizen Faction. As such, they will not lure us in now to avoid provoking the Aristocratic Faction.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s faces were ashen as the atmosphere was rather stifling.</p><br/><p>Only Silver Mist Sea and Palette Cloud Village were left in the Avalon of Five Elements so Elders Guild was still battling internally. It was bitterly painful.</p><br/><p>\"They don\u2019t care at all. To them, people like us, high in number but weak in strength, are good practice targets. Plus, it\u2019s too easy to deal with us. They just have to find someone to get rid of Ai Hui and we will all fall apart. If they take action again, it\u2019ll be like plucking perfectly ripe fruit \u2013 effortless.\"</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun continued, \"We don\u2019t even have to consider Jadeite Forest. Even I am unwilling to return to that place.\"</p><br/><p>These words silenced everyone further. The future seemed so bleak.</p><br/><p>Thinking about the conversation he had with Shi Xueman that day, Jiang Wei spoke up. \"We can inhabit the Wilderness and construct a city that belongs to us. Ai Hui is very familiar with the Wilderness so if we can hunt more dire beasts, Lou Lan can prepare more elemental food and our skills will improve quickly.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s eyes lit up.</p><br/><p>\"What if Elders Guild wants to take it back?\" Duanmu Huanghun asked. \"We can build a city, but with a simple order Elders Guild can revoke it. The Elders Guild may not deal with the aristocratic families since they\u2019re their own people, but what about us? When the internal battle is over, our good days are too.\"</p><br/><p>Ai Hui spoke suddenly. \"We can sell that city to an aristocratic family and move to Old Territory.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone was in shock. Old Territory?</p><br/><p>\"Don\u2019t forget the purpose of our reunion. We are here to seek revenge.\" Ai Hui said in a low voice, \"The Avalon is urgently undergoing reconstruction now, so there won\u2019t be a war with Blood of God for the time being. We can only head to Old Territory if we want to battle with Blood of God. Old Territory is where the key strategy to attacking Blood of God lies.\"</p><br/><p>Fatty looked cheerful. Going to Old Territory was a good thing since his family was still there.</p><br/><p>\"What about resources?\" Duanmu Huanghun questioned. \"Why did the Avalon abandon Old Territory? It\u2019s because there aren\u2019t much resources. How are we going to compensate for that? Where are we going to get our regular training and battling supplies? Plus, it is surrounded by enemies from three corners. Anyone can attack us in that battleground. What are we going to do if Avalon of Five Elements and Jadeite Forest stab us in the back?\"</p><br/><p>Ai Hui kept quiet. Duanmu Huanghun made a lot of sense and he was unable to refute this reasoning.</p><br/><p>But he wasn\u2019t angry. Such a big matter wasn\u2019t going to be easy naturally. \"Let\u2019s make use of these few days to train as much as we can and digest the medication. Fists work better than anything else. We\u2019ll take our time to think of solutions. I\u2019m sure we will come up with something.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He was not interested in the pursuit of earthly pleasures.</p><br/><p>This group of rich playboys had only heard of him and had never met him in person before.</p><br/><p>Forget his reputation, who would dare to stand up to him if even someone as powerful as Young Master Yu had to bow?</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun always felt at home amongst his companions, doing as he pleased. He raised the glass of wine in his hand and said flatly, \u201cToday is my dear friend Little Wu\u2019s birthday. Let\u2019s all drink one glass to congratulate him. Bottoms up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Qirong trembled with excitement. To hear such words from Brother Huanghun was a rare and precious gift! Although he had known Brother Huanghun for many years, Wu Qirong could only observe him from afar. The gap between them was so great that they might as well have been from different worlds. Wu Qirong had always thought of Brother Huanghun as someone destined for greatness, someone who would someday become a grandmaster or a division head.</p><br/><p>He was clear of his station in life. And for just this sentence, he would do anything for Brother Huanghun.</p><br/><p>Holding back his emotions, Wu Qirong promptly stood up and raised his glass for a toast. \u201cThere is no need for more words. From today onwards, Brother Huanghun shall be my blood brother!\u201d</p><br/><p>He lifted his head and swiftly drained the glass.</p><br/><p>In the Avalon of Five Elements, everyone developed elemental energy from a young age. What they were drinking was elemental wine, and one cup was enough to give them a rush, making them feel as if the elemental energy within their body was ignited.</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun too downed the drink without saying another word.</p><br/><p>He rarely drank and practiced restraint in many other aspects of his life as well. Although he seldom met anyone who could rival him, Duanmu Huanghun simply didn\u2019t indulge in these pleasures.</p><br/><p>He took pride in his discipline.</p><br/><p>The elemental energy within his body was set ablaze, the warmth quickly spreading to his extremities. A red flush spread appeared on his pale face, softening his features and causing him to appear less aloof.</p><br/><p>The others didn\u2019t dare to have the slightest hesitation and downed the drink in one gulp as well.</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun tugged at his collar and squinted his eyes as he enjoyed the feeling granted by the wine. The flames had spread throughout his entire being, consuming even the fog in his mind.</p><br/><p>However, the grievances that he was nursing in his heart made him want to erupt even more violently.</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun managed to restrain himself\u2014he did not forget the main reason for his visit. He wasn\u2019t some weakling who needed to rely on alcohol to numb himself. He was going to defeat that detestable bastard through direct means.</p><br/><p>Yes, he was going adopt the most effective, convincing method available, and that was to wallop that damned Ai Hui until he begged for mercy!</p><br/><p>After drinking the wine, the guests had become slightly more restless. Duanmu Huanghun\u2019s terrifying, murderous intent soon pervaded the entire dining table, sending chills down their spines as they became silent.</p><br/><p>Yu Ziyi shivered the most.</p><br/><p>This was just too familiar!</p><br/><p>He was all too familiar with this atmosphere. The faint memories of his past began to surface like a school of hungry fish. This was the atmosphere that would arise whenever Brother Huanghun wanted to deal with someone.</p><br/><p>Damn it! Why am I so unlucky? Why am I here on one of his bad days?</p><br/><p>Yu Ziyi was so nervous that he was on the verge of bursting into tears.</p><br/><p>\u201cI came here today to get some ideas from you guys.\u201d</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun\u2019s words gave Yu Ziyi a big shock. Gathering ideas from others? He could not help but glance at Duanmu Huanghun. This didn\u2019t seem like Brother Huanghun\u2019s usual style; he was always a lone wolf. Since when did he need others\u2019 help in coming up with ideas?</p><br/><p>Sadly, they couldn\u2019t tell if Brother Huanghun was happy or angry.</p><br/><p>Nobody dared to make a sound.</p><br/><p>Brother Huanghun may have asked for opinions, but did you really think that you have the right to speak up? Don\u2019t be so naive!</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun was very familiar with such situations and knew that nobody would dare to speak if he didn\u2019t clarify himself further. Getting straight to the point, he announced, \u201cI\u2019m here to get everyone to help me think of ways to earn money!\u201d</p><br/><p>What?</p><br/><p>Everyone stared in disbelief, wondering if their ears were playing tricks on them.</p><br/><p>The almighty and highly-regarded Duanmu Huanghun, the eldest son of the illustrious Duanmu family, was actually asking them for advice on how to earn money?</p><br/><p>Big Brother, this joke isn\u2019t funny at all\u2026</p><br/><p>Even Yu Ziyi\u2019s eyes grew wide open in shock as he stared at Duanmu Huanghun\u2014it was as if he had just seen a ghost.</p><br/><p>Wu Qirong muttered weakly, \u201cBrother, your matters are certainly more pressing! Here are my savings of two million yuan, Brother\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone else immediately followed suit, disregarding their heartache, as they offered whatever they had in a show of loyalty. Yu Ziyi, not wanting to fall behind the rest, put on a brave front and offered, \u201cI have five million yuan, Brother Huanghun can have it all!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Ziyi was crying inside, lamenting the loss of every last cent of his wealth. He did not dare to underreport how much he had; he was afraid that Duanmu Huanghun would easily find out that he was lying through his network of infatuated women in the Yu family. If it came to that, Yu Ziyi would probably end up being skinned alive, if not killed.</p><br/><p>Alright, losing five million might be a bit heart-wrenching, but at least it wasn't a complete waste. Besides, Yu Ziyi knew that Brother Huanghun was a prideful person and wouldn\u2019t simply accept handouts.</p><br/><p>Frankly speaking, Yu Ziyi had been astonished when Brother Huanghun had started talking about money.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thank you all for your goodwill,\u201d Duanmu Huanghun said as he shook his head. \u201cBut I\u2019m not looking to borrow money. What I want is to earn money. Okay, let me phrase it in another way\u2014can all of you help me think of ways to make five hundred million yuan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s eyes grew even wider.</p><br/><p>This time, however, nobody made any noise.</p><br/><p>The people present had some money on them, ranging from a couple of hundred thousands to a million yuan. Yu Ziyi\u2019s five million was already exceedingly rare.</p><br/><p>But five hundred million yuan?</p><br/><p>This was not a quantifiable concept.</p><br/><p>Yu Ziyi\u2019s allowance of five million was probably already the highest. Although the influential families could easily afford to spend five hundred million worth of resources on their youths, they would most certainly not casually give any one of them control of so much.</p><br/><p>Yu Ziyi cautiously asked, \u201cBrother Huanghun, did something happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Duanmu Huanghun said as he turned to face Yu Ziyi.</p><br/><p>Yu Ziyi nervously replied, \u201cI was intimidated by that fi-five hun-hundred million\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I made a bet with someone to see who could earn five hundred million first,\u201d Duanmu Huanghun said calmly. Everyone else heaved a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>Making a bet was a common practice in this circle, and among them, all manners of bets were possible! Five hundred million may sound like an exorbitant amount, but considering Brother Huanghun\u2019s status, how could any of his bets be of the same level as theirs?</p><br/><p>Only a bet of five hundred million yuan was worthy of someone like Brother Huanghun!</p><br/><p>Seeing everyone rack their brains, Duanmu Huanghun\u2019s face lit up with satisfaction.</p><br/><p>\u201cI spend most of my time training, and as such, I know next to nothing about businesses. I have thus taken the liberty of coming over to consult with you guys. I know that you all know more than I do and that you have more connections and methods as well. Regardless of who comes up with it, I will definitely return the favor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun\u2019s gaze swept across the table. However, his voice suddenly became much deeper, and it acquired a murderous intent.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf no one can come up with a good idea, then none of you will leave today!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

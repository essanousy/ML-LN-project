His six senses were sharper and better than most master elementalists\u2019. Even the high-altitude, noiseless blood bats could not escape him.</p><br/><p>But the voice behind him was like a ghost appearing from nowhere.</p><br/><p>He detected nothing until he heard it.</p><br/><p>He was shocked, but his real-life combat experience benefited him at such a time. Before his brain had time to process the situation, he had already launched his Dragonspine Inferno behind him out of instinct.</p><br/><p>But it was empty. The Dragonspine Inferno caught nothing.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s you, One Thousand Yuan boy.\u201d A lady\u2019s sweet, sticky voice sounded from before him.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui raised his head. He knew not when, but a woman dressed in red smiled at him while standing on the branch that had entrapped the elementalist. She sat down easily, her red dress like a waterfall.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui was utterly shocked. It was the same lady in red whom he had met in front of the noodle shop.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeeing an old friend makes me so happy.\u201d She looked Ai Hui up and down with excitement. \u201cThose who came before were either old or ugly; you look the best. See, you didn\u2019t pay me, but I said you\u2019re pretty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui\u2019s mental state was highly tense. The lady in red had unfathomable powers. Plus, it seemed...</p><br/><p>His gaze fell on the branch below her. The tree roots which had been so wild before were now quiet and placid. But recalling how they had sucked that elementalist dry earlier, the sight before him frightened him still.</p><br/><p>His throat dried up and his heart pounded increasingly fast, but he forced himself to remain calm. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m a beauty!\u201d the lady answered matter-of-factly before blinking. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that? Beautiful as a fairy.\u201d</p><br/><p>She then shook her head, feigning sadness. \u201cMen are heartless, forgetting what they\u2019ve said just a few days prior? Indeed, if you want to trust a man\u2019s words, you might as well believe that there\u2019s a ghost in this world. Spending a thousand yuan is useless!\u201d</p><br/><p>Finishing her sentence, she was unable to restrain a smile.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui did not relax in the slightest. The tree roots remained still and the surrounding forest was quiet, but the pretty and flirtatious lady before his eyes was immeasurably powerful. Her laughter tinkled like silver bells, reverberating around the woods.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou planted the blood poison?\u201d Ai Hui swallowed his saliva and kept his cool.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not that capable.\u201d The lady looked Ai Hui up and down again before continuing, \u201cBlackie died in your hands, right? I smelled his scent on your body earlier.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBlackie?\u201d Ai Hui opened his eyes wide and dared not loosen up.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe blood fiend baby that I\u2019m keeping. It\u2019s a very powerful bat.\u201d The lady was doubtful. \u201cHow strange. You\u2019re not that strong, so how did you kill Blackie?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui\u2019s scalp started to feel numb. He finally understood why he met her in front of the noodle shop. She was trying to track down that blood bat!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhatever!\u201d The young lady stretched. \u201cYou killed Blackie, so you must be more powerful. I only like powerful things! Plus, how interesting\u2014beautiful as a fairy! I feel so shy! Don\u2019t worry, follow me in the future, and I\u2019ll let you have a good life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Interesting\u2026 it was his first time being called interesting.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui was not happy at all. Instead, he was trying to find an opportunity to escape, but the situation was not in his favor.</p><br/><p>Her power was unpredictable. He was unable to detect her presence even when she was close by. The same was true for when she flew up to the branches. Moreover, the surrounding roots and vines did not affect her, but they were fatal to him.</p><br/><p>Then the dense weeds, thick like walls, were natural obstructions blocking his path.</p><br/><p>On his way here, he had carefully avoided the weeds\u2019 serrated edges when pushing through. The moment he got cut meant a dead end for him. There was absolutely no antidote for the blood poison at this point.</p><br/><p>The hope for a direct and successful escape was very slim.</p><br/><p>As for any regrets he had over his decision to risk his life like this, it was meaningless to think of it now.</p><br/><p>He was thankful only that the lady did not attack him directly. Perhaps she had insufficient experience, perhaps it was deliberate, or perhaps it was a game to her. No matter the reason, stalling for time was a good option in his current situation.</p><br/><p>There was no lack of strong elementalists this time. If they happened to pass by, he could take the chance to escape.</p><br/><p>All right!</p><br/><p>Ai Hui\u2019s mind was turning rapidly, but his face showed no sign of it. Rapidly formulating a plan, he initiated, \u201cWhy are you guys doing this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d The lady in red asked naively, \u201cThen why are you training?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo control my own destiny,\u201d Ai Hui responded.</p><br/><p>\u201cControl your own destiny?\u201d The lady in red gave a blank stare but soon started laughing happily. \u201cI like this saying! Indeed, you\u2019re worthy of being my subordinate. How interesting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd you guys\u2014why?\u201d Ai Hui asked in a low tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly God can control his own destiny.\u201d The lady in red looked Ai Hui over again, her gaze flickering. \u201cHow can ordinary beings struggle free from fate\u2019s stocks and chains? Of course, they can choose a better lock. For example, becoming my underling will ensure a bright future. Think about it? I like it when people act according to their wishes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd then I\u2019ll be sucked dry like him?\u201d Ai Hui replied coldly while pointing at the desiccated corpse on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou killed him.\u201d The lady\u2019s smiling face was like a flower. Seeing Ai Hui\u2019s look of disbelief, she continued unhurriedly, \u201cAlthough he was trapped, it was actually his good fortune. Do not look down on these bloods. They are the spiritual essence of countless blood insects and beasts, and maybe a thousand or ten thousand of them entered his body. Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s good fortune? If he had survived, his strength would have increased exponentially, much faster than your training. Are you moved? Do you want to control your own destiny? How can you do it without power? I can give you power\u2014much more than what you have now! How about it? Are you moved?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, it was as if raging waves had hit his chest. He was no longer able to remain calm. \u201cYou guys swallowed all of the blood insects, treating them as nutrients, and gather them into a human body\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA human body? No no no!\u201d The lady in red shook her head like a rattle-drum. \u201cNo one can endure the power of so many blood insects. Even God can\u2019t do it. Humans mustn\u2019t be so greedy!</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe you have the gift!\u201d She sized Ai Hui up before continuing, \u201cI\u2019ll let you try later, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m very generous. If you want it, I\u2019ll give it to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The lady gave a charming expression and winked at Ai Hui.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui finally understood why the forest was so deathly still and silent. He felt a chill in his body, an incorporeal hand firmly strangling his throat.</p><br/><p>The events currently unfolding completely subverted all of his knowledge.</p><br/><p>Clap!</p><br/><p>A sound like that of a watermelon splitting suddenly rang out from deep within the forest.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, these people have such weak essence.\u201d The lady was clearly displeased. \u201cThey can\u2019t even endure such little blood spiritual force? Useless. God wouldn\u2019t even want such rubbish. The greatest contribution trash can make is to become nutrition for a genius. Sigh, there\u2019s enough nutrients but not enough talents. Hey, are you a genius?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui sharply inhaled in an attempt to restrain the throbbing of his heart.</p><br/><p>That exploding sound couldn\u2019t have been an elementalist who had failed to endure the infusion of blood spiritual force\u2026.</p><br/><p>Wait!</p><br/><p>Blood spiritual force!</p><br/><p>Ai Hui soon grasped the crux of the matter. Blood spiritual force\u2014spiritual force! Having disappeared for over a thousand years, the once-resplendent and magnificent spiritual force had actually reappeared\u2026.</p><br/><p>This isn\u2019t real\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpiritual force, you said?\u201d Ai Hui asked hoarsely. His state of mind was utterly unguarded at this point. He even forgot about escaping.</p><br/><p>Because of spiritual force.</p><br/><p>He knew what its reappearance meant.</p><br/><p>His sword techniques and secrets could be of use. The countless sword manuals he had read that were covered in grime and regarded as rubbish could be useful again. Their dust-covered brilliance, scattered into years of legends and folklores, would reemerge on this land.</p><br/><p>The extinct cultivators would reclaim their world. Be it the Avalon of Five Elements or the Wilderness, neither were worth mentioning in front of them. No one would be able to stop the cultivators.</p><br/><p>Impossible\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The lady smiled. \u201cLooking forward to it? Cultivation is becoming a long-forgotten term. Look, we\u2019re finally able to recover our legacy. How about it? Are you all fired up? Probably getting impatient\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, with great strength, Ai Hui charged towards Central Pine City like a launched arrow.</p><br/><p>\u201cMen are full of empty words!\u201d</p><br/><p>The indistinct voice travelled from behind Ai Hui. Her breath was fragrant and stuck close to his body.</p><br/><p>A cold ray flashed past Ai Hui\u2019s eyes. Without a sound, the Dragonspine Inferno struck backward from his left underarm.</p><br/><p>Fell through again!</p><br/><p>Damn it!</p><br/><p>Things were not looking good. Without waiting for Ai Hui to turn around, the voice sounded once again from the back of his neck.</p><br/><p>\u201cKnow why I\u2019m talking to you for so long? So much trash is bothersome enough, so I\u2019m just waiting for these trees to recover, and I can prepare a big meal for you. Am I not especially nice to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Without warning, Ai Hui braked and with the power of both legs, lunged himself backwards with all his might.</p><br/><p>[Arching Fish Back]!</p><br/><p>But it was once again fruitless. Ai Hui\u2019s heart dropped.</p><br/><p>The voice came from behind his neck again. The lady stuck onto him, her puffs of breath landing just above his ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough I like it when people act according to their wishes, if they can\u2019t do it, I find it tasteful to force myself upon them too. One Thousand Yuan boy, I will make you comfortable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui\u2019s body tensed as suddenly, his body was bound by the root-like objects. The immense force made his body lose all control, and with how tightly he was wrapped, he felt himself losing consciousness.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>Was he going to die?</p><br/><p>Or become a monster?</p><br/><p>Ai Hui\u2019s limbs were ice-cold.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

In reality, his mind was blank.</p><br/><p>His entire body was shivering due to the cold while a guy was pressing against his chest with both arms and panting heavily. He could not see the guy\u2019s face clearly. As his head buzzed, his mind blanked out as if he was heavily punched in the side of the head.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui noticed that Duanmu Huanghun\u2019s eyes were open, however, his pupils\u2026 seemed to be disorganized?</p><br/><p>Although he had seen a lot of grisly scenes in his life, Ai Hui panicked for a moment. When he first entered the Wilderness, there was a total of two thousand laborers. In the end, only two survived. The rest were forever buried in the muddy ground of the Wilderness. Ai Hui witnessed how they fell into pools of their own blood firsthand. He saw how their eye pupils dilated until life disappeared from them.</p><br/><p>\u201cLou Lan, what\u2019s wrong with him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey buddy, wake up! Are you okay? Don\u2019t fall asleep!\u201d Ai Hui asked while slapping Duanmu Huanghun\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Lou Lan was somewhat puzzled at the scene before him. He then commented naively, \u201cHe\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Smack smack smack!</p><br/><p>Ai Hui slapped Duanmu Huanghun\u2019s face with force.</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun\u2019s unfocused eyes gradually regained clarity. His vision slowly recovered and the glazed look on his face disappeared. When he clearly saw the face of the person before him, his face turned blank.</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t this guy that wretched bastard?</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t this person the useless guy who skipped lessons, refused to train, held the entire class back, and had poor aptitude?</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t he the main culprit who caused him to fall ill, wasted his time, and tarnished his reputation as a genius?</p><br/><p>Fury gushed through his head and hatred filled his mind. Duanmu Huanghun sat up abruptly, wanting to rip this hateful fellow into a thousand pieces. Suddenly, his body froze.</p><br/><p>Trembling...</p><br/><p>His entire body was trembling in the cold.</p><br/><p>His facial expression froze and his body froze. After a while, he lowered his head in shock.</p><br/><p>He was only wearing his underpants. His thighs and arms were covered with bright red palmprints, contrasting greatly with the rest of his pale white body.</p><br/><p>Ohh... No!</p><br/><p>Fear appeared instantly in his widened eyes. What had this bastard done to him?</p><br/><p>Once again, Duanmu Huanghun\u2019s mind was blank. He subconsciously grabbed the clothes beside him and scuttled out of the training hall.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui and Lou Lan looked confusedly at the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems that he has recovered. Lou Lan, you\u2019re really awesome.\u201d Ai Hui\u2019s voice was filled with joy. He could finally go back to training.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though there was a short period of time when Lou Lan did not understand what was wrong with him, Lou Lan can see that he has recovered now.\u201d Upon hearing Ai Hui\u2019s compliment, Lou Lan was beaming with joy as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Lou Lan. I shall go to train now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGoodbye, Ai Hui.\u201d</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun walked on the street as a rustling, cold breeze blew against his chest. He was completely filled with despair. He did not dare to recall the scene just now or what had happened after he was knocked out.</p><br/><p>To him, this was the darkest moment in his life.</p><br/><p>After a while, Duanmu Huanghun gradually calmed down from the horror. Suddenly, he realized that he had recovered fully from his cold. He was a unique individual that could not be matched by ordinary people. After all, he came from an aristocratic family and had an outstanding aptitude that was meticulously nurtured by his family.</p><br/><p>After he regained his composure, he thought of the reddish palmprints on his limbs and roughly understood how he recovered from his illness.</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun was somewhat surprised. How could trash like Ai Hui know such a method? Even an experienced and knowledgeable individual like himself needed to think for a long time before coming up with such an idea. Ai Hui used such an unorthodox method to cure his flu in the time that it would take for others just to think of this approach.</p><br/><p>One must note that having a lot of knowledge was one thing, but putting that knowledge to practical use was quite another.</p><br/><p>Perhaps this fellow was not as inferior as he thought?</p><br/><p>A metal elementalist that specialized in healing?</p><br/><p>Even though this seemed weird, this type of metal elementalist had appeared before in the history of the Avalon of Five Elements. Perhaps he did underestimate Ai Hui. After all, it was impossible to enter the Induction Ground with that fellow\u2019s inferior aptitude. He might have some other special talents, so the Induction Ground could have made him an exception.</p><br/><p>After calming down and determining how his opponent cured his cold, Duanmu Huanghun did not really care about what had just happened. However, when he thought of being knocked by such a weak individual, his face darkened.</p><br/><p>Even though he could come up with excuses, such as he was sick, he was exhausted, or his opponent\u2019s attack was too sudden, he still could not accept the fact that he was knocked out by a garbage classmate.</p><br/><p>It was too humiliating!</p><br/><p>Especially once he thought of the teacher\u2019s request, his face reddened. The teacher wanted him to guide the trash to success, yet he was knocked out by such trash.</p><br/><p>Yes, he could come up with many reasons.</p><br/><p>He was far too careless and underestimated his opponent. He let anger get the better of him. His body was so weak that he caught a cold just by standing in the wind. His stamina was so low that a night of training left him completely drained...</p><br/><p>However, there was not a single reason that Duanmu Huanghun could accept.</p><br/><p>He was a genius!</p><br/><p>Geniuses do things that others can\u2019t do! How could he compare himself to the ordinary people? That was slacking. That was failure.</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun, you are indeed an embarrassment!</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun cursed himself in his heart.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, he noticed people on the street were pointing fingers and mocking him. Most of them were girls. As he walked past these girls, they covered their mouths and whispered about him.</p><br/><p>No, it\u2019s not right!</p><br/><p>No matter where he went, Duanmu Huanghun had never had such an experience in his life before.</p><br/><p>Could it be that there was dirt on his face?</p><br/><p>As he walked past a weapon shop, he stopped in his tracks. He picked up a shiny, polished sword, used its blade as a mirror.</p><br/><p>He was dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>Who was this guy whose face was swollen like a pig head?</p><br/><p>A thought flashed across his mind. A blurry image intruded into his mind without any warning. A blurry figure seemed to be yelling something at him while slapping his face forcefully with both his hands in quick succession. The figure appeared to be continuously slapping him.</p><br/><p>Smack smack smack....</p><br/><p>Loud and crisp smacking sounds. His face was like a bun that was being steamed. It inflated slowly and then..</p><br/><p>The face in his mind merged together with the image displayed on the reflection of the blade.</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun\u2019s lips quivered while his hand that gripped the sword trembled. Like a volcanic eruption, he clenched his teeth, let out a roar, and almost tore down the roof of the weapon shop.</p><br/><p>\u201cAi Hui, I will rip you into pieces!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

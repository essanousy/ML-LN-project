Where did you learn about it?\"</p><br/><p>He had been responsible for the Shi Clan Training Hall of Central Pine City for a very long time, and therefore, he was familiar with everything about the city\u2014especially with matters concerning training halls. He was literally one hundred percent sure that there was no such training hall in Central Pine City.</p><br/><p>Now that the young mistress had mentioned such a bizarre place, though, he was seized with a feeling of foreboding. He was not worried about her safety at all because he clearly knew of her strength. However, having grown up in a relatively simple environment where she cared about nothing but training, she was naive and ignorant to the various ways of the world. This kind of girl would easily be cheated.</p><br/><p>Shi Xueman described what had happened.</p><br/><p>Yong Zheng felt even more uneasy. \"The bead bracelet was the one you are always wearing?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, that was the only thing I could pledge. It is Grandmother\u2019s memento, so I always wear it.\" She noticed the change in Uncle Yong Zheng\u2019s facial expression. \"Uncle Yongzheng, was there any problem with that guy?\"</p><br/><p>When he heard that the bracelet was Shi Xueman\u2019s grandmother\u2019s memento, Yong Zheng felt himself break out in a cold sweat.</p><br/><p>The bead bracelet was made of Calming Indigo Silk, which was produced by a wild beast known as the Winged Indigo Silk Bird. However, due to its sparse production, it was extremely precious; even in the Cultivation Era, such beads were invaluable.</p><br/><p>Moreover, this bracelet was handed down by Shi Xueman\u2019s grandmother!</p><br/><p>He was aware of the identity and status of Shi Xueman\u2019s grandmother. If this bracelet was lost in Central Pine City, which was under his jurisdiction, then how could he afford to take the responsibility?</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019ll go check right now!\" Yong Zheng hastily rushed out, leaving everything else behind.</p><br/><p>Shi Xueman was not a sophisticated woman, but she was clever; looking at Uncle Yong Zheng\u2019s nervousness, she immediately understood what he was thinking. However, she was not as worried, because although the bead bracelet was given as a pledge, it was she who had offered to do so. Therefore, she did not really believe it was a scam.</p><br/><p>After a while, Yong Zheng returned, sweat dripping down his face. \"Young Mistress, I got it. There is indeed a Vanguard Training Hall which had been closed for a long time. Recently a student moved in to do the cleaning and maintenance.\"</p><br/><p>\"Thank you, Uncle. Please give me the address. I\u2019ll go there myself.\"</p><br/><p>Shi Xueman felt relieved. She was not worried of being cheated, as she was confident of getting back anything within the whole Induction Ground, let alone the small Central Pine City. She just did not want to see a kind deed turn out to be a scam, which would really make her unhappy.</p><br/><p>Yong Zheng was also relieved. Thank goodness it was not a scam. He hurriedly handed the address to Shi Xueman. As for her safety, Yong Zheng was not worried at all.</p><br/><p>He had long witnessed her powerful fighting abilities.</p><br/><p>Along with the address and money, Shi Xueman headed out.</p><br/><p>After the welcome ceremony, Duanmu Huanghun withdrew to his new residence. Due to his excellent contribution, the academy had arranged another place as his accommodation, which possessed the highest elemental energy concentration and was fitted with luxurious interior decorations.</p><br/><p>....</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun could now finally relax and have some rest.</p><br/><p>These days he had been constantly worn out. He had held on till now because of the resentment in his heart, but now that it was released, he was overwhelmed with fatigue.</p><br/><p>Lying in bed, however, he could not fall asleep.</p><br/><p>His mind could not help but wander to the awkward tumble at the city gate. Ever since his birth, he had never done anything so shameful. Under everybody\u2019s keen attention and at the most awe-inspiring moment of his life, he had totally disgraced himself.</p><br/><p>The more he thought about it, the more furious he became. Damn it!</p><br/><p>He himself was clueless to why he tumbled on hearing Ai Hui\u2019s voice at the time.</p><br/><p>After pondering for a while, Duanmu Huanghun unconsciously sat up as he began to feel serious. A horrible phrase had suddenly occurred to him\u2014inner demons!</p><br/><p>The more he thought about it, the more he believed it to be true. Ai Hui\u2019s voice was indeed like a nightmare to him, and this was definitely an inner demon. As a genius in training, Duanmu Huanghun had always had a sharp intuition. Having analyzed his abnormal reactions in front of Ai Hui, he knew that his judgment was right.</p><br/><p>Inner demons were actually not that rare in the process of training, especially to geniuses of higher levels\u2014Duanmu Huanghun had learned about this from many books and records. Inner demons were able to influence one\u2019s training, somewhat similar to a psychological barrier.</p><br/><p>As one\u2019s base level increased, the requirement for a perfect mental state would become more demanding, although it may be different depending on the type of technique practiced. Some techniques would require practitioners to be aggressive and determined, while even the slightest fear may prevent them from going any further, whereas some techniques necessitated a tranquillity and indifference in one\u2019s mind, and if a practitioner could not free himself from worldly attachments, it would be hard to attain success in that technique.</p><br/><p>Inner demons had always had a big influence on one\u2019s training. The affected person may find it hard to improve. In serious cases, one might even develop an obsession that would cost his or her life.</p><br/><p>Last time, when he had opened his eyes in the biting cold, he had almost been traumatized by the palm prints all over his body. At the thought of this, his face began to burn. When he remembered his old puffy face, a furious flame blazed out in his chest, and when he recalled today\u2019s awkwardness \u2013 he felt as if a bowl of hot oil was directly poured to the flames in him.</p><br/><p>Hatred! Old and new!</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun\u2019s eyes grew red in fury. He was now one hundred percent sure that Ai Hui was the demon in his heart. He thought back to a set phrase in training that he had read before\u2014demon decapitation.</p><br/><p>Only when one\u2019s inner demons were decapitated would one be able to return to the right path and prevent oneself from going astray. Demon decapitation did not necessarily mean the decapitation of the person who is the demon, but like untying a knot, one had to get over it by oneself.</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huang decided to decapitate his inner demon!</p><br/><p>It was a problem that he had ignored previously, and today, he would solve it entirely and release himself from his rage. Duanmu was quite certain of success; since Ai Hui\u2019s natal palace hadn\u2019t even been opened, he definitely had a negligible level of skill.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Duanmu had just defeated three of the top fifty rivals. To him, small potatoes like Ai Hui would be more than simple to defeat. He had not done this before merely because of the task assigned by Teacher Xu.</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun, who was now fully confident, began to think about how he should go about decapitating his inner demon.</p><br/><p>Should he disgrace Ai Hui just as how Ai Hui had disgraced him?</p><br/><p>Once this idea occurred to him, Duanmu became exhilarated. Yes, that was it! He thought over each step: first, make him catch a cold, and then treat it in the way as Ai Hui had done. He would pay him back in his own coin! Ah, and don\u2019t forget the puffy face! And the tumble!</p><br/><p>A cold, evil grin appeared on Duanmu Huanghun\u2019s face. Ai Hui, just wait and enjoy the treat!</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun could not help but let out a wild, wicked cackle.</p><br/><p>Mwahahahahaha\u2026</p><br/><p>Duanmu, lost in his great excitement, could not feel the fatigue in his body anymore as he grabbed an elemental energy mask and put it on his face. He could not wait to begin.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

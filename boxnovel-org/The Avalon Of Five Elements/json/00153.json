Troops of anxious elementalists were patrolling the streets, reassuring everyone that things were under control and that they should stay at home as much as possible.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui had a bad feeling about this. He could feel that the elementalists\u2019 were tense like he had never seen before.</p><br/><p>He kept his head down, silently passing through the streets and headed toward the Vanguard Training Hall.</p><br/><p>Both the noodle shop girl and Duanmu Huanghun had already left.</p><br/><p>Fatty\u2019s face was filled with panic, but seeing Ai Hui allowed him to relax and heave a sigh of relief. He asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s happening outside? Why does it seem so chaotic?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have no idea,\u201d Ai Hui said, shaking his head. \u201cSomething big must have happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there anything Lou Lan can help with?\u201d Lou Lan chimed in with his head tilted.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui let out a short burst of laughter upon seeing Lou Lan\u2019s cute actions before replying, \u201cNot for now, but I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll need your help soon enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty knew Ai Hui like the back of his hand. He already knew that something was amiss from the moment he saw Ai Hui\u2019s expression. \u201cIs the situation really that bad?\u201d Fatty asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say for sure yet,\u201d Ai Hui replied flatly. He knew that he would not be able to stay out of it this time.</p><br/><p>The reward he received came with certain expectations. Moreover, Ai Hui knew that the city\u2019s strength was considerably limited. The teachers may be powerful, but their pitiful combat experience hardly qualified them as competent fighters.</p><br/><p>His worries about the blood poison incident worsening appeared to be coming true.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you still standing here?\u201d Ai Hui asked while glaring at Fatty. \u201cYou should be training!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty could see that Ai Hui was in a foul mood. Dejected, Fatty silently retreated to a corner to train.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry Ai Hui, Lou Lan will definitely help you!\u201d Lou Lan cheered.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui smiled and thanked Lou Lan.</p><br/><p>Considering the Induction Ground\u2019s sluggish response, it was not exactly surprising that the situation had worsened.</p><br/><p>If the situation continued to deteriorate, there would be nowhere to escape to. Based on their current strength, they would likely end up as food for the blood fiends once they left the city. Furthermore, his master and the others were still here. It was impossible for Ai Hui to sit back and watch as they succumbed to the disaster.</p><br/><p>He was suffering from all these agonizing thoughts.</p><br/><p>He was still too weak. The thought of facing the blood poison disaster with his meager power made him feel utterly insignificant. Ai Hui was not even certain that he could contribute much to the city\u2019s defensive efforts.</p><br/><p>After all, what could a student who had only recently activated four palaces accomplish?</p><br/><p>These unbearable thoughts were suffocating Ai Hui. He had been a free spirit in the Wilderness, where his only concern was his own survival. Now, he was tied down by the lives of so many others whom he wished to protect: Master, Mistress, Senior Mingxiu, Lou Lan, and Fatty.</p><br/><p>He took a deep breath to dispel the wild thoughts flooding his mind and started to train.</p><br/><p>Having just activated both of his foot palaces, he had yet to properly analyze them.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui was soon deeply immersed in his training.</p><br/><p>The sky began to darken as time quietly passed. A student hurriedly rushed over to inform Ai Hui that he was to return to the academy immediately.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui did not hesitate in the slightest.</p><br/><p>Upon reaching the academy, he was summoned to the dean\u2019s office.</p><br/><p>The dean looked as if he had aged ten years, and the hair along his temples had grown white. He smiled at Ai Hui and said, \u201cStudent Ai Hui, you have given me a big surprise. I shall get straight to the point of why I\u2019ve called you here today. The first thing I\u2019d like to settle is your reward. Student Duanmu should have already spoken to you about this. Feel free tell me what you have in mind as a reward, even things such as inherited knowledge, elemental food, or equipment. Of course, it has to be something that the academy can provide.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui replied without delay, \u201cDean, I hope to learn the [Big Dipper] technique.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c[Big Dipper]?\u201d the dean asked, a little surprised. \u201cThis must be your teacher\u2019s idea. It looks like he\u2019s been guiding you well. The [Big Dipper] is Central Pine Academy\u2019s greatest inheritance and, although it isn\u2019t a lost skill, it still has its distinct features. Learning it is no mean feat since studying the [Big Dipper] requires the trainee to have seven strong palaces. Oh, I\u2019m so muddleheaded. Old Wang must have already tested your constitution before encouraging you to ask for the [Big Dipper]. He just loves to study such things.\u201d</p><br/><p>The dean solemnly shook his head, appearing to remember something from his past.</p><br/><p>He walked toward the bookcase, pressing his palm on it. A complex pattern of light emerged along the bookcase, dazzling Ai Hui. The next moment, different-colored balls of light appeared all over the bookcase in a picturesque fashion, each one about the size of a fist.</p><br/><p>The dean retrieved a ball that looked like a dark nebula. The lump of black vapor in his hand was scattered with tiny dots of light and was extremely eye-catching. Ai Hui came to a sudden realization that every one of these balls of light contained an inheritance.</p><br/><p>His gaze fell on the nebula. Could this be the [Big Dipper]? How is this thing accessed?</p><br/><p>Having never seen something like this before, Ai Hui was filled with curiosity and anticipation. Ai Hui thought of himself as a country bumpkin without much experience.</p><br/><p>The dean noticed Ai Hui\u2019s nervous anticipation and laughed. He was reminded of his younger days, back when he first laid eyes on an inheritance. The sense of nostalgia invoked by this memory seemed to have cleared up his mind quite a bit.</p><br/><p>\u201cPut your hand on it,\u201d instructed the dean.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui carefully placed his hand on the nebula in the dean\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cCirculate your elemental energy,\u201d the dean continued.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui carefully circulated his elemental energy. A bright flash appeared in front of his eyes and he appeared to have been dragged into a void. Packed together in dense clusters, stars were all around Ai Hui.</p><br/><p>The star-filled sky suddenly began to revolve.</p><br/><p>The star-filled sky swirled into rings of light, drowning Ai Hui within. After an indeterminate amount of time, seven stars emerged from the light rings, tracing out the shape of a ladle. The ladle rotated and expanded in front of Ai Hui\u2019s eyes, appearing to fly toward him.</p><br/><p>It was quite a while before Ai Hui awoke from the trance-like state with a violent jerk.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow does it feel?\u201d the dean asked, smiling.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui hesitantly replied, \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to describe. It feels as though I\u2019ve gained some knowledge, but I really can\u2019t say for sure. Dean, is this the [Big Dipper]?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, indeed,\u201d the Dean answered, nodding his head in affirmation. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just the [Big Dipper], it\u2019s the original [Big Dipper].\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018original\u2019?\u201d Ai Hui was confused.</p><br/><p>The dean patiently explained, \u201cThe original [Big Dipper] is the primary source of this inheritance. In accordance with academy regulations, legacies and skills that are passed on to students are done so via copies. In addition to the details of the inheritance, the primary source also contains some of the creator\u2019s experiences and realizations, making it extremely valuable. You\u2019ll soon come to realize that every round of replication results in more information being lost from the original. Inheritance skillsets that are sold on the market tend to be very inferior copies. So, do you think you\u2019ve got a good deal?\u201d</p><br/><p>The dean was amused by Ai Hui\u2019s look of amazement.</p><br/><p>\u201cDefinitely,\u201d Ai Hui replied as he attempted to keep his facial expression in check. He looked up at the dean and continued weakly, \u201cAlthough, why am I feeling guilty? I guess there\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t even falter after experiencing a surprise this huge. With such mental fortitude, old Wang has indeed taken in a good student.\u201d The dean was all smiles as he proceeded with his instructions, \u201cI\u2019ll now continue with the other matter at hand.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Ai Hui gave the situation some serious thought, he realized there was definitely something he had to do to earn such a reward. Given his current ability, Ai Hui was definitely not capable of resolving any major issues for the dean. He would most likely be asked to deal with some minor concern.</p><br/><p>The dean paused for a moment before speaking, \u201cYou\u2019ll be cooperating with Shi Xueman and the others from now on. Shi Xueman, Sang Zhijun, and you will be working hand in hand. I believe that you three are already quite familiar with one another. This group, which the three of you will be a part of, is relatively stronger than the other groups and will thus be assigned several missions.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui quietly waited for the next part.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have rich combat experience. I\u2019ve looked through your file and noted that you\u2019ve previously stayed in the Wilderness for three years. It\u2019s no mean feat for a laborer to survive the Wilderness. I\u2019d say that you have the most combat experience in the entire academy. Shi Xueman is the leader of the other team, of which I have no control over. You\u2019ll be the leader of a new team, taking charge of several outstanding students that will be handpicked by me. Duanmu Huanghun will be your deputy. Both of your teams will operate together as a group.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui continued to remain silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf, and I\u2019m only saying if, the situation becomes critically dangerous, I hope that you will guarantee Shi Xueman and Duanmu Huanghun\u2019s safety. Do you understand what I mean?\u201d The dean spoke solemnly, his gaze set on Ai Hui.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui did not avoid the dean\u2019s gaze as he calmly replied, \u201cDo you mean to say that the others are disposable as long as Shi Xueman and Duanmu Huanghun survive?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d exclaimed the Dean. Ai Hui had taken the words right out of his mouth, relieving him of his apprehensions. \u201cPerhaps the situation won\u2019t degrade to that point. We\u2019re definitely the first city in line for reinforcements, so there\u2019ll be support coming to join us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause of them?\u201d Ai Hui asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes,\u201d said the dean while nodding his head. \u201cLife is often unfair. The lives of some are worth more than others. Although such things are better left unsaid, this is the truth of the matter. If something happens to the two of them and the reinforcements get wind of it, everyone here will be knee deep in sh*t. Your wealth of experience, mature disposition, and outstanding swordplay reflect your potential. While these may not necessarily be useful, I\u2019m still willing to place my bet on you. For all we know, you might just give me a pleasant surprise.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI accept this mission.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui\u2019s straightforward reply startled the dean. It made the carefully chosen words of his speech appear to have been for nought.</p><br/><p>The dean was happy to know that he picked the right person.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, I have two conditions.\u201d</p><br/><p>The dean was again taken aback by Ai Hui\u2019s audacity. Surprise turned to admiration as he responded, \u201cSay it, if it is within my means.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, as the leader I\u2019d like to pick the other members myself. Everyone in my team will have to obey my orders unconditionally, even Duanmu Huanghun.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis, I agree with,\u201d the dean swiftly answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond, I need a few spots in the first batch of people to be evacuated once the reinforcements arrive.\u201d</p><br/><p>The dean was gobsmacked. He scrutinized the young man standing in front of him.</p><br/><p>Dark, clear, and calm, Ai Hui\u2019s eyes were as deep as the ocean.</p><br/><p>After a moment\u2019s hesitation, the dean asked, \u201cHow many spots do you need?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201dMe, my teacher Wang Shouchuan, his wife Han Yuqin, Senior Mingxiu, my good friend Qian Dai, as well as my sand puppet Lou Lan.\u201d</p><br/><p>The dean heaved a sigh of relief, \u201cYou do not need to worry about those 3 from the Jade Embroidery Workshop as they have already been allocated evacuation slots. Adding you in won\u2019t be a problem either, which means you only need an additional 2 spots. All right, you\u2019ve got yourself a deal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui responded with his own sigh of relief. \u201cDeal.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two stood there as they exchanged glances and smiled.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

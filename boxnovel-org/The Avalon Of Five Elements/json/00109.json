Ai Hui was now as poor as a church mouse. He didn\u2019t even remember how much money he owed, and even worse, daily consumables such as Twilight Cocoons, herbs, materials, and manpower were driving up his costs every day.</p><br/><p>He strongly felt that training was akin to burning money.</p><br/><p>Why didn\u2019t he feel so before? Well\u2026that was probably because his previous so-called training was far from the standard.</p><br/><p>If so, then life was hard for elementalists, too. Hmmm\u2026 maybe not. Not everyone was as poor as him.</p><br/><p>If one had too many debts, then they would no longer worry about it. Ai Hui didn\u2019t bother to think about his debts further\u2014rather, he didn\u2019t dare think about it.</p><br/><p>The reason why he had just refused Mingxiu\u2019s proposal was that he wanted to study his hand palaces further. Ai Hui was still excited about the fact that both his hand palaces were activated at the same time, and he didn\u2019t want to waste time extracting more Twilight Silk. Money? No one cared about money!</p><br/><p>Except himself!</p><br/><p>Ai Hui\u2019s eyes were wide; they were twinkling like stars in the sky.</p><br/><p>Mingxiu tittered. Ai Hui\u2019s facial expression was pretty much the same as that of a money-grubber. Mingxiu didn\u2019t know that Ai Hui was so greedy for money\u2014she only realized it now. Who did he learn it from?</p><br/><p>It was a pity that he was Uncle\u2019s disciple\u2014Uncle really was poor, but he always held himself aloof. He could accept Master\u2019s help with tiny issues, but he would become unhappy if she wanted to spend more money for him.</p><br/><p>For so many years, Master had always wanted to financially sponsor Uncle\u2019s research, but Uncle never agreed. He would rather do it himself without extra help in his small courtyard filled with waste products.</p><br/><p>Uncle was always stubborn, and Master couldn\u2019t do anything but give up.</p><br/><p>This was his only shortcoming\u2014 he would never give in to money, which was respectable but exasperating.</p><br/><p>In this aspect, Ai Hui was entirely different. He was always keen for money, and his eyes would light up every time he heard the word \u201cmoney.\u201d Master had complained several times about this to Mingxiu, saying that Ai Hui was wasting his talent and that he was vulgar without any proper plans for his future. And next, she would complain about Uncle, saying he was terrible at teaching his own disciple.</p><br/><p>But Mingxiu thought it was all right. Uncle was unyielding like a steel plate; however, a steel plate could be broken. On the other hand, Ai Hui was persistent yet resilient, just like the Twilight Silk he extracted. Every time Mingxiu saw his hard work and thought about his experience, she would sincerely feel admiration. At the same time, though, she couldn\u2019t help but feel protective towards him. She herself had nothing to worry about since she was young\u2014she had never experienced or even imagined that kind of life.</p><br/><p>\u201cEach arrow is made of ten pieces of Twilight Silk and is sold for thirty thousand yuan. You will provide Twilight Silk to Manager Li, and in return, you get thirty percent of the profit. Manager Li will provide the Twilight Cocoons and herbs.\u201d Mingxiu explained everything clearly and concisely.</p><br/><p>Thirty thousand yuan for each arrow!</p><br/><p>This was daylight robbery!</p><br/><p>Ai Hui almost blurted out loud, but the next second, he realized that part of the money would belong to him!</p><br/><p>This was daylight robbery! But why not?</p><br/><p>He bit his tongue and proceeded to ask the key question. \u201cHow many arrows can you sell in one month?\u201d</p><br/><p>Manager Li thought for a while before saying, \u201cThe ten arrows I made last time have already been sold out. I\u2019m not exactly sure how many arrows I can sell in one month, but since it\u2019s a consumable, I believe we can sell quite a lot although it\u2019s not cheap. If we look at the sales records of similar goods, after the market opens up, I think we can sell three to five hundred arrows every month.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui\u2019s eyes widened with a glittering light. \u201cFive hundred! That is fifteen million yuan, and thirty percent is four million five hundred thousand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Manager Li began to sweat. \u201cNot that much. First, we have to consider the cost, including the cost of cocoons, manpower, materials, and the rent for the shop. At least twenty percent of the price goes there. I think Mingxiu can figure this out too.\u201d He turned to Mingxiu. \u201cYou know I\u2019m not lying.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mingxiu nodded as she knew that Manager Li was speaking the truth.</p><br/><p>\u201cNext, in the beginning, we can hardly sell five hundred arrows. Before the power of the arrow is proved, no one will buy it on a large scale. I\u2019ll reach out to my regular customers first, and I estimate that dozens of arrows can be sold out. Once it\u2019s accepted by most people, the sales will increase. Earlier on, I think at most we can sell thirty to fifty arrows within a month.\u201d</p><br/><p>Manager Li was conservative, which was something he had to be. If he exaggerated the possible income but failed to reach the target, then he would get himself into trouble, because the boy in front of him would definitely not let him off easily.</p><br/><p>From three or five hundred to thirty or fifty\u2026the gap was big, and the money he could earn was far less than he had imagined.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui stared at him with dissatisfaction, but he still told himself, \u201cAnyway, it\u2019s better than nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFifty arrows with a profit of twenty-four thousand for each. Thirty percent is three hundred and sixty thousand yuan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mingxiu told Ai Hui gently, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. There may not be much profit in the beginning, but it\u2019s a long-term business. Besides, it doesn\u2019t require much silk, so it won\u2019t influence your training. I think you can do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThree hundred and sixty thousand yuan is already a lot of money to me,\u201d Ai Hui said happily.</p><br/><p>Yet Manager Li didn\u2019t take him seriously. As the disciple of a master, three hundred and sixty thousand could barely be enough for his pocket money. He quickly replied, \u201cAs soon as we open up the market, the sales will increase. By the way, we need to give the material a new name so that no one will know it is actually Twilight Silk.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Mingxiu nodded. \u201cYou can give it a name, Ai Hui. It deserves a new name. If I hadn\u2019t seen it for myself, I could never have related it to Twilight Silk.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes. I\u2019ve been making weapons for so many years, but I\u2019ve also never seen Twilight Silk like this,\u201d Manager Li said.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui didn\u2019t refuse them. He thought for a while and said, \u201cLet\u2019s call the silk \u2018Snow Silver Bunny Hair\u2019 and the arrow \u2018Bunny Hair,\u2019 shall we?\u201d</p><br/><p>Manager Li was a bit confused at first, but then after a minute, he realized Ai Hui\u2019s intention. He couldn\u2019t help give him a thumbs-up. \u201cThat\u2019s smart.\u201d</p><br/><p>The name itself wasn\u2019t that smart, but in this way, the customers would think that it was made from the hair of some kind of rabbit. As a result, no one would know that the snow-white, silvery thread was actually Twilight Silk. When he thought of those imitators who would start chasing all kinds of rabbits to find the material, Manager Li couldn\u2019t help but let out a laugh.</p><br/><p>This boy was really cunning!</p><br/><p>Manager Li made a mental note to be careful and not irritate this fellow. Although Ai Hui didn\u2019t look the part, he was actually very shrewd.</p><br/><p>Even Mingxiu couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cThis name is cruel to rabbits.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui chuckled. Neither of them had understood his real intention. The word \u201cbunny\u201d sounded similar to \u201cmoney.\u201d Once the arrows were sold and profits were earned, he would be a man with money!</p><br/><p>\u201cBut can bunny hair be this long?\u201d Mingxiu asked curiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d Ai Hui was surprised. \u201cI\u2019ve seen rabbits with hair much longer than this in the Wilderness. They are very fierce, and they can bite off a chunk from a tree trunk that\u2019s as thick as a bowl. They like to eat shrubs, leaves, and meat, and their hair is also pretty much the same as Twilight Silk\u2014it\u2019s snow-white with a silvery sheen, but it\u2019s much thicker, though.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Ai Hui\u2019s extremely low base level, Manager Li was astonished when he heard that Ai Hui had been in the Wilderness before. None of the disciples of the master seemed to be normal...</p><br/><p>The Wilderness\u2026</p><br/><p>Mingxiu remembered the various amazing details and weird species of the Wilderness that Li Wei had told her about, and she couldn\u2019t help but be enchanted with this mysterious place.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

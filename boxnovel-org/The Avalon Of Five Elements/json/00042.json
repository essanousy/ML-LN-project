Many weapon shops would not even bother to display such a sword on their shelves; instead, they would likely tie such swords with rope and toss them in a corner, leaving them to collect dust. The selling price for such weapons was less than a thousand yuan.</p><br/><p>Even the practice swords that Shi Xueman used during training were worth tens of times more than that grass sword.</p><br/><p>She never imagined that a run-of-the-mill grass sword could emit such a resplendent light.</p><br/><p>The light emitted from the blade resembled that of brilliant fireworks\u2014it was the most dazzling sword glint she had ever seen. The moment the grass sword left Ai Hui\u2019s hand, it transformed into a ray of brilliance that was as fine as a steady drizzle. It left a gorgeous trail of light as it pierced through the air, flying towards the hooligan at the mouth of the alley.</p><br/><p>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!</p><br/><p>The grass sword made short work of Duanmu Huanghun\u2019s clothes\u2014it was as though countless hands were tearing away at them, and they were instantly shredded away, scattering around him like butterflies.</p><br/><p>Shi Xueman, whose eyes were opened wide, quickly looked away.</p><br/><p>Plop!</p><br/><p>A smooth, pale body soared through the air from the alley, directly landing onto the main street.</p><br/><p>At first, the pedestrians were rather dazed by the sight, but a couple of girls soon started shrieking uncontrollably.</p><br/><p>Shi Xueman was visibly shocked, her gaze inadvertently landing on Ai Hui, who was currently in the air. That sword technique was definitely many times more skillful than what she had witnessed earlier. Could this be his true caliber?</p><br/><p>She had met a few experts of swordplay, but not even a single one had left her in this much awe. Swordplay has been on the decline for quite some while, and although those experts possessed an abnormal fighting strength, they always appeared to be shrouded in an aura of despondence and lack of ambition. She greatly disliked the vibe they gave off and hence never had much of an interest in so-called swordplay experts.</p><br/><p>However, that sword technique earlier\u2026\u2026 it was truly amazing!</p><br/><p>After Ai Hui unleashed that move, his entire body felt like it was moving independently of time. Snapping out of that soundless state of complete concentration, he felt as though he had woken up from a dream. His surroundings were utterly empty. Eh, in the air? He looked down and was instantly dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>This high?</p><br/><p>I actually\u2026jumped this high?</p><br/><p>Not good!</p><br/><p>Ai Hui\u2019s body started to plummet rapidly. His arms and legs were flailing in all directions and his face was a deathly white. He remembered the time he fell off a cliff this high in the Wilderness; he ended up half-dead and required half a month to recover.</p><br/><p>Even worse, he discovered that his hands and legs had gone soft, and his elemental energy was thoroughly drained. Even the sword he was holding\u2026\u2026was thrown away! Help!</p><br/><p>Shi Xueman was frozen, still awestruck. By the time she had snapped out of her daze, Ai Hui\u2019s situation was critical\u2014he was a mere ten feet above the ground.</p><br/><p>With a whistling sound, a wave of yellow sand swiftly swept past.</p><br/><p>Lou Lan had arrived in the nick of time.</p><br/><p>Although Ai Hui had a lingering fear after being carried by Lou Lan, he gave Lou Lan a pat on the shoulders. \u201cThank you, Lou Lan!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Ai Hui,\u201d came the overjoyed reply.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui was satisfied with the results of his sword technique. Killing was not permitted in the Induction Ground, but upon seeing the naked body of the other party lying in the middle of the street for all to see, his anger dissipated quite a bit.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, he frowned. \u201cLou Lan, look at that guy\u2019s body. Doesn\u2019t it look a bit familiar?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lou Lan turned to face the body. A yellow light flickered in his eyes as he stated matter-of-factly, \u201cYes, indeed. An analysis of his build reveals a match of greater than ninety percent with that of Bangwan, whom you had previously healed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, so it is Bangwan!\u201d The revelation left him laughing with indignation.</p><br/><p>Ever since the last time, when Bangwan had bluffed others by saying that he hadn\u2019t yet recovered from his cold, Ai Hui had felt that his morals were highly questionable and treated him with disdain. Looking at him now, Ai Hui felt that he was indeed a childish, delinquent youth. He shook his head in disappointment. \u201cLet\u2019s go back, Lou Lan.\u201d</p><br/><p>From their conversation, Shi Xueman could discern a rough idea, and was under the impression that that naked figure was one of Ai Hui\u2019s classmates named Bangwan. She simply had no idea that he was actually the great genius Duanmu Huanghun who had just dazzled the entire Induction Ground.</p><br/><p>The flames of anger in her heart finally satiated, Shi Xueman started to calm down. Losing the Calming Indigo Silk may be difficult to bear, but nothing good would come out of harping on about it. As she walked back, she tried to think of ways to solve the issue.</p><br/><p>She was not generous enough to simply let him off, but what kind of compensation should she seek?</p><br/><p>Walking down the alley, Lou Lan enthusiastically said, \u201cAi Hui, I think I can restore the neighboring walls that have been damaged!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui was practically moved to tears. \u201cLou Lan, you\u2019re really the best!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m just a sand puppet.\u201d Lou Lan was especially glad that he could help Ai Hui.</p><br/><p>Only with Lou Lan could he experience the warmth of spring. Ai Hui was deeply touched. He turned around to face the girl from the noodle shop, his face grim. \u201cSo tell me, how exactly do you want me to settle this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shi Xueman had just thought of something, but Ai Hui\u2019s tone made her furrow her long, shapely brows. She retorted, \u201cYour tone makes it sound as if I\u2019m the one who owes you eighty million yuan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui was momentarily embarrassed, so he relaxed his tone. \u201cJust tell me, what do I have to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou definitely can\u2019t return the eighty million yuan all at one go,\u201d Shi Xue Man said while giving Ai Hui a glance. \u201cI have two conditions. The first is that you must become my sparring partner for swordplay and instruct me accordingly. The next would be to help me find someone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui heaved a sigh of relief. \u201cGreat! It\u2019s a deal then. I\u2019ll teach you swordplay as well as help you to find that person in exchange for writing off my debt of eighty million yuan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou wish!\u201d Shi Xueman exclaimed grimly. \u201cThis is only the interest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui was instantly enraged, and he warned, \u201cNoodle shop girl, you better not take advantage of me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shi Xueman remained unmoved. She said flatly, \u201cHow about you ask your sand puppet friend for the current interest rates that are out on the market?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui looked towards Lou Lan.</p><br/><p>Lou Lan reported honestly, \u201cThe interest rates on loans generally start from ten percent.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ten percent was not really all that much. Wait, what\u2019s ten percent of eighty million yuan?</p><br/><p>Eight million!</p><br/><p>Ai Hui\u2019s eyes grew wide with fear.</p><br/><p>\u201cSee, I didn\u2019t try to cheat you.\u201d Shi Xueman glared at him. \u201cYou think your swordplay is worth eight million?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui did not even utter a word.</p><br/><p>With the ongoing decline of swordsmanship, even renowned experts of swordplay would not command eight million yuan. Moreover, Ai Hui was not so conceited to claim that his swordplay was on par with that of those experts.</p><br/><p>The greatest tragedy in the world was to be stuck without a retort against the logical and factual arguments of others.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m giving you the task of finding the person because you live in Central Pine City and should thus be more familiar with it.\u201d Although Shi Xueman felt that entrusting this task to such a fellow was rather ridiculous, any additional aid would be beneficial.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui asked dejectedly, \u201cWhat does this person look like?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo idea.\u201d Shi Xueman shook her head.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui looked at Shi Xueman, suspicion written all over his face. \u201cAre you trying to make a fool out of me? How am I supposed to find someone without knowing what he looks like?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shi Xueman muttered, \u201cThe last time I met him was in a blind battle at the training hall. Starting your search from the training ground should make things easier.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTraining hall?\u201d he blurted. It was now Ai Hui\u2019s turn to sneer. \u201cLou Lan, how many training halls are there in Central Pine City?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lou Lan once again stated matter-of-factly, \u201cForty-six.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shi Xueman declared, \u201cBut of course, I still have more information.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

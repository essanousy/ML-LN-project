He tried his best to impress her, making her laugh non-stop. In contrast, Teacher Xu was patiently teaching the students who were listening carefully to his lesson.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe teachers named this area the Garden of Life. Why that name? There are many wood-attributed teachers in the Induction Ground, and everyone knows that they love breeding new species of plants, which then results in a large number of newly bred plants. These plants, however, are not valuable, yet the teachers are unwilling to destroy them. So, they transplant them here. There are so many bizarre plants here now, that even the teachers can\u2019t keep track of them all, which has resulted in us calling this place the Garden of Life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWon\u2019t there be problems? Isn\u2019t it dangerous?\u201d one student couldn\u2019t help but ask.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, everyone hopes for exactly that.\u201d Seeing everyone\u2019s puzzled faces, Teacher Xu laughed. \u201cI shall let the wood-attributed Duanmu Huanghun explain why to everyone here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The bunch of girls acting like a flock of ducks were driving Duanmu Huanghun crazy. He had not been in a good mood to begin with, so if not for the presence of the teacher, he would have already chased them away.</p><br/><p>Teacher Xu\u2019s words caught everyone\u2019s attention.</p><br/><p>In the other students\u2019 eyes, Duanmu Huanghun was a mysterious figure, so when they heard Teacher Xu say that Duanmu Huanghun knew the answer, they immediately directed their attention to him. They wanted to know if the legendary Duanmu Huanghun knew the answer.</p><br/><p>Even Cui Xianzi stopped talking with Zhou Xiaoxi to look at Duanmu Huanghun with interest.</p><br/><p>The rowdy girls surrounding Duanmu Huanghun finally quieted down and stared anxiously at him with their eyes wide open.</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun felt like a suffocating fish that could finally breathe some fresh air. He gave Teacher Xu a grateful look, then his facial expression turned cold as he answered, \u201cFrom a wood elementalist\u2019s perspective, having problems with the plants is a good thing, because it means that there is room for more changes and new possibilities. When breeding a new plant species, the more changes there are, the more beneficial it is. I think this is the scenario all the wood-attributed teachers are hoping for.\u201d</p><br/><p>The amount of adoration in those young girls\u2019 infatuated eyes increased significantly.</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun ignored these gazes. There was absolute silence in his surroundings.</p><br/><p>If this silence could last, Duanmu Huanghun did not mind talking for the rest of the day.</p><br/><p>So he did just that; before Teacher Xu could open his mouth, Duanmu Huanghun continued to speak with confidence, \u201cThe reason why there are no changes is not that complicated. According to the current theory, elemental energy is the biggest factor that causes changes to occur in plants. The higher the concentration of elemental energy in an area, the more likely changes will occur in the plants there. This explains why there are a lot of mystical plants in the depths of the Wilderness. Even though the Garden of Life is located within the Induction Ground, it is in a place very near the Old Territory, so the concentration of elemental energy there is very low. This is why the likelihood of changes occurring in plants there is also very low\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was captivated by Duanmu Huanghun\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Teacher Xu nodded his head repeatedly, feeling especially proud of his student. For a first year student to come up with such conclusion showed a lot about his solid foundation.</p><br/><p>Teacher Xu continued from where Duanmu Huanghun stopped, \u201cClassmate Duanmu is correct. The oldest plant in the Garden of Life can be dated back to when the Avalon of Five Elements was established; however, the number of changes occurring in the plants there are becoming less and less, because the concentration of elemental energy is very low. Even those thousand-years-old ancient trees are no exception.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui shot a glance at Duanmu Huanghun, which was caught by Fatty.</p><br/><p>Fatty knew Ai Hui too well. From the look on Ai Hui\u2019s face, he knew something was up. He lowered his voice and asked, \u201cYou have a dispute with this guy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA small matter,\u201d Ai Hui replied without batting an eyelid. \u201cHe owes me some money.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe owes you money?\u201d Fatty\u2019s eyes immediately widened as he rolled up his sleeves and rubbed his palms together. \u201cThat\u2019s intolerable! He owes you how much money? I will help you collect the debt!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne hundred and fifty million yuan,\u201d Ai Hui replied plainly.</p><br/><p>Fatty staggered and almost fell down. He could not help but raise his voice, \u201cHow much?\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice was exceptionally loud in the silence and everyone turned to look at the two simultaneously.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne hundred and fifty million yuan,\u201d Ai Hui replied calmly.</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun, who was previously filled with arrogance, staggered and almost fell down. Other people may have been baffled when they heard Ai Hui talking about one hundred and fifty million yuan, but Duanmu Huanghun clearly knew what Ai Hui was talking about.</p><br/><p>Goddamn bastard!</p><br/><p>Blue veins appeared at the back of his hands as he clenched his fists.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne hundred and fifty million yuan?\u201d Fatty muttered, shocked, \u201cIt can\u2019t be, how can someone be so stupid? Is it even possible to owe so much money?\u201d</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun almost lunged at him.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui noticed everyone\u2019s attention on them and stopped talking. After a while, the other students lost interest and directed their attention elsewhere. Ai Hui and Fatty maintained some distance from the main body of students, walking together at the back.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? One hundred and fifty million yuan?\u201d Fatty asked again, solemnly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lie,\u201d Ai Hui replied plainly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI knew it. You almost frightened me to death.\u201d Fatty pat his chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cFatty,\u201d Ai Hui suddenly called out to him.</p><br/><p>Fatty knew Ai Hui wanted to say something, just by taking a look at his face.</p><br/><p>Instinctively, Ai Hui scanned the bushes and trees around them. Without looking at Fatty, he asked, \u201cHow\u2019s your training progressing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have just activated my right hand\u2019s palace,\u201d Fatty replied weakly. When he heard Ai Hui\u2019s question, he had a bad feeling. Fatty might be very stubborn, but Ai Hui still scared him the most.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui was expressionless, but deep down he was shocked.</p><br/><p>It appeared that Fatty was far more gifted than he was.</p><br/><p>If not for his blessing in disguise and his managing to activate two palaces, Fatty\u2019s training progress would have surpassed his.</p><br/><p>\u201cAi Hui, how about you?\u201d Fatty glanced warily at Ai Hui.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeft and right hands\u2019 palaces,\u201d Ai Hui replied.</p><br/><p>Fatty had an \u2018isn\u2019t-it-obvious\u2019 look on his face. It had been like this since the days they were together in the Wilderness. Other than running for his life, there was nothing he was better at than Ai Hui.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom today onwards, I will be monitoring your training.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui\u2019s tone was cold and without leeway; Fatty\u2019s face filled with anguish. Every time he wanted to open his mouth and say something, he would timidly close it before any words came out. Every time Ai Hui used such a tone to talk to him, he would have miserable days ahead of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou like to meddle in other people\u2019s business, right? Only capable people are qualified to meddle in other people\u2019s business. Those who are not capable would only seek death if they tried.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty was touched by Ai Hui\u2019s naggy words. He knew Ai Hui wanted the best for him.</p><br/><p>Just as Fatty was about to raise his head and declare his determination, Ai Hui suddenly stopped in his tracks.</p><br/><p>\u201cFatty, did you hear something?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui squinted his eyes. Fatty was too familiar with this facial expression of Ai Hui\u2019s. Something was wrong. His pupils constricted as he saw Ai Hui\u2019s hand silently move towards his sword hilt.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

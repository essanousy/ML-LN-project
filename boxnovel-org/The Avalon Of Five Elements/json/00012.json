He was a talented young man no doubt. Elegantly dressed with a solid build, and his handsome face carried a devilish charm\u2014definitely the type that girls swooned over.</p><br/><p>Other than his haughty nature, this fellow had few shortcomings. But of course, he had every right to be proud.</p><br/><p>He was born into a prestigious sect that had a long-standing history within the Avalon of Five Elements. In fact, an ancestor of the Duanmu Clan contributed to the creation of the Avalon. Not only that, but Duanmu Huanghun was outstandingly talented. Of all the students, he was among the top five.</p><br/><p>Teacher Xu felt his head throb. There was nothing wrong with being proud\u2014it was normal for youths to be hotheaded. Plus, which youth was not? Perhaps he had been teaching in the Induction Ground, he had seen many talents, causing him to worry when he noticed Duanmu Huanghun\u2019s hostility towards students of a lower realm. However, as an experienced educator, he kept a straight face and asked calmly, \u201cHow is it going? It\u2019s been awhile since school started. Any impressions?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Duanmu Huanghun responded with slight aloofness. \u201cJust that the academic program is too simple.\u201d</p><br/><p>Teacher Xu smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s because you were homeschooled and have talent. Of course you\u2019ll find it easy. This is also why I chose you as the class monitor, so I have high expectations for your excellent leadership skills. I hope you won\u2019t grow lax and continue to work hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing his teacher\u2019s confidence in him, he became excited. Compliments were irresistible to youths his age. Leader, what an admirable title, he thought. Just thinking about it moved him. He puffed his chest out and replied loftily, \u201cDo not worry, Teacher Xu, I won\u2019t let you down.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can do it!\u201d Teacher Xu sounded exceptionally certain. \u201cThen as a leader, how should you treat teammates who are not as strong as you? Of course you must help them! It is the responsibility of a leader after all. Let me assign you a mission. Ai Hui is slightly weaker, and I need you to assist him. How does that sound? Think you can do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun\u2019s jaw dropped. He was stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cI knew from the start that you were born to be a leader!\u201d Teacher Xu continued happily without waiting for a response. \u201cI will leave Ai Hui in your hands! I don\u2019t expect the impossible. Hopefully, one year from now, he\u2019ll be able to activate four palaces.\u201d</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun was left speechless. Activating four palaces in one year? What a joke\u2014this garbage had yet to open his natal residence...</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is a talent? A talent is someone who can achieve the unachievable!\u201d With a stern expression, Teacher Xu asked, \u201cDuanmu Huanghun, are you doubting the talent in you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2014\u201d Duanmu Huanghun blurted out.</p><br/><p>But immediately after, his face darkened as if he had just swallowed a fly. He felt terrible. Right from the start he disliked that trash Ai Hui. Of the whole city, only six students were required to attend the introductory course but one of them just had to be from his class. As the class monitor, he couldn\u2019t get himself to like this burdensome garbage.</p><br/><p>What right did this garbage have to be teammates with a gifted student like himself?</p><br/><p>And now the teacher actually expected him to be in charge of this fellow. This lightning bolt seemed to strike him out of the blue.</p><br/><p>He was going insane. Just looking at this guy made his blood boil. But now that he was supposed to help him, wouldn\u2019t he have to see this garbage every day? Duanmu Huanghun was certain he\u2019d go crazy by the end\u2014no, maybe he already was!</p><br/><p>Going into Teacher Xu\u2019s office had been a giant mistake. Something so ridiculous actually happened to him!</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun stumbled out of the office, still in shock.</p><br/><p>After a few steps, he suddenly understood what he just promised to do. He agreed to assist that garbage into activating four palaces! If being in charge of this garbage was like stepping into mud, activating four palaces in a year was like falling into a poisonous swamp.</p><br/><p>The elemental energy system had more or less reached maturation from thousands of years of development and improvement. Different family clans and schools had their own unique practices, but the core methodology did not stray from the system of the five residences and eight palaces.</p><br/><p>The production of elemental energy first occurred in the five residences, or the natal residences. Each produced different elemental energies: fire from the heart, wood from the liver, earth from the spleen, metal from the lungs, and water from the kidneys.</p><br/><p>The initial step to any training system was to activate the natal residence. Only then could the first door that separated the physical body from the external world be opened. The natal residence acted as a catalyst in the absorption of elemental energy which had a nature that differed greatly from spiritual force. While the energy was stored within the body, its flow did not follow the meridians.</p><br/><p>After much fumbling, humans managed to find eight elemental energy storages and named them palaces. When all eight were filled, an Initial Completion was accomplished.</p><br/><p>In the Induction Ground, filling four palaces was not a big deal. Not to mention the seniors, even he had four palaces filled.</p><br/><p>But Ai Hui was a piece of garbage who had just completed his introductory course. Loading four palaces? What a joke!</p><br/><p>If not for Teacher Xu\u2019s good reputation and public praise, Duanmu Huanghun would have suspected him of pulling his leg. Only a genius could progress from nothing to four palaces within a year. Why then would such a genius require his help?</p><br/><p>His face was as black as the underside of a pan. He almost turned and charged into Teacher Xu\u2019s office again.</p><br/><p>But once he recalled the teacher\u2019s words that \u201ca talent is one who can achieve the unachievable,\u201d he abruptly stopped in place.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, he was a gifted genius!</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun clenched his teeth. He roughly pulled apart his beautifully embroidered shirt collar. Pfft, \u2018defeat\u2019 was not a word in his dictionary. A genius like him could never give up so easily.</p><br/><p>Poor garbage, you better thank Heaven for blessing you with such an opportunity.</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun raised his chin and readjusted his collar, regaining his usual grace.</p><br/><p>He strolled down the corridor and thought hard on how he could reach the target Teacher Xu had set for him, not caring about the adoring gazes from the girls lining the corridor. Thanks to the knowledge and experience he had from being homeschooled, he quickly came up with a few possible plans.</p><br/><p>His eyes lit up and his handsome face was full of concentration. Instead of his usual arrogance and viciousness, another kind of aura fell upon him.</p><br/><p>The smittened female students were so distracted by him that they lost their footing and fell hard on the floor. Duanmu snapped out of his thoughts and raised his head. As his enchanting eyes fell upon them, they momentarily forgot their pain\u2014they were love-struck.</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun involuntarily laughed, his warm smile mesmerizing.</p><br/><p>Thud, thud, thud!</p><br/><p>A series of tumbling noises rang out in the hallway.</p><br/><p>Ten minutes later, Duanmu Huanghun stood ashen-faced beside the hot spring\u2019s whirlpool. He scanned his surroundings a few times, but saw no one at all. Despite searching the usual training grounds frequented by students, he could not find Ai Hui. He even asked a few classmates but no one had seen him.</p><br/><p>Damn it!</p><br/><p>Steam was coming out of his ears. Duanmu Huanghun had never been so angry before.</p><br/><p>It was humiliating enough for him to teach this garbage, but d*mn, this piece of trash was lazy! Not only did he lack the skills but he also wasn\u2019t hard-working, unable to even attain the basic training routines. How was this useless lump of mud going to transform into a solid wall?</p><br/><p>Yet no matter how angry he was, he still could not locate Ai Hui\u2019s whereabouts.</p><br/><p>He specially made a trip to the dormitory to ask around, only to realize that Ai Hui did not stay there. No one knew where he lived.</p><br/><p>Godd*mn!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

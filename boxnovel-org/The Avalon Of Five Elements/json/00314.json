He knew of Dragonrise\u2019s good reputation of course. It was the first time in the Avalon of Five Elements that a battle master had established a training hall. Among his colleagues, there was no lack of sons from Silver City\u2019s influential officials. He\u2019d heard that Dragonrise Training Hall\u2019s background was far from simple.</p><br/><p>Citizens coined this match the battle between the training halls. Dragonrise Training Hall wasn\u2019t willing to let Swordsman Training Hall snatch their limelight and was determined to re-establish their reputation through this method.</p><br/><p>Jiang Wei wasn\u2019t sure why, but he smelled danger coming from the seemingly honorable war between the training halls.</p><br/><p>In three years, not only had he been on the front line and participated in countless battles against the blood elementalists, he also witnessed many scheming fights. Places which seemed unremarkable were usually unexpectedly dangerous.</p><br/><p>Jiang Wei straightened out his thoughts once more but found nothing amiss.</p><br/><p>He heaved a sigh of relief. Perhaps he was just being overly suspicious.</p><br/><p>The soldiers under him reported that someone was here to visit.</p><br/><p>He stopped himself from overthinking, got up and walked to the main hall, where a tall and sturdy man stood in the center. Upon getting a clear look, Jiang Wei couldn\u2019t help but smile. He walked forward with big steps and gave a solid hug to the visitor. \"A Jinai! Long time no see! I\u2019m so happy to see you!\"</p><br/><p>A Jinai grew a thick, forest green beard. He had deep set, brown eyes and a high nose bridge. These features were the evidence of his Grass Clan\u2019s blood from the Old Territory.</p><br/><p>Grass Clan was one of the better clans in Old Territory, because each year there would be at least some youngsters who would qualify to enter the Avalon of Five Elements. Most of them moved on to become wood elementalists upon entering the avalon.</p><br/><p>A Jina used to be Jiang Wei\u2019s team leader, but was promoted to the back as he\u2019d sustained an injury from accomplishing a meritorious deed for the team. A Jinai took great care of Jiang Wei in the past, so naturally Jiang Wei was extremely glad to see his ex team leader.</p><br/><p>\"Looks like I\u2019ll have to call you master soon,\" A Jinai\u2019s resounding laughter filled the hall. \"Elders Guild must really have faith in you to hand such a huge responsibility over to you!\"</p><br/><p>Jiang Wei smiled. \"Don\u2019t tease me, A Jinai. I\u2019m not living as comfortably as you. You\u2019re living the life of an immortal.\"</p><br/><p>\"How so? I\u2019m so busy I could die.\" A Jinai saw the doubt in Jiang Wei\u2019s gaze and smacked his head. \"I forgot to mention that I\u2019m no longer a civil servant but am moving about and around the Ling\u2019s residence.\"</p><br/><p>Jiang Wei was slightly taken aback but congratulated him instantly. \"How amazing for you to be socially connected to them. No wonder you look so well-nourished.\"</p><br/><p>Influential families were further divided into different ranks. There were two top-notch metal elementalist families in Silver Mist Sea, being the Ling residence and Gong residence. Their statuses were similar to that of Shi family and Lian family of Palette Cloud Village. These four families were currently the most well-guarded residences in the whole of the Avalon of Five Elements. Earth, metal and wood elementalists were all declining in strength and struggling badly.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t easy to be accepted by the Ling residence. These influential families held up unimaginably high barriers against outsiders. But similarly, their capabilities were beyond imagination.</p><br/><p>Although A Jinai tried hard to restrain himself, he couldn\u2019t help but feel a little pleased. \"I\u2019m still far from your level. Plus, you\u2019re still a single man. I wonder how many people have their eyes on you. Haha, you\u2019re shy now, have a sweetheart?\"</p><br/><p>Jiang Wei gave a bitter laugh. \"I\u2019m on the front line everyday so how is that possible?\"</p><br/><p>A Jinai clapped his palms together, laughing, \"That\u2019s good!\"</p><br/><p>Jiang Wei said, displeased, \"Such gloating. Looks like we will have to talk with our fists.\"</p><br/><p>This was A Jinai\u2019s catchphrase from years back. Jiang Wei\u2019s voice imitation cause A Jinai to burst into hearty laughter.</p><br/><p>Laughter faded as A Jinai said with a chuckle, \"You\u2019re a rare commodity now. The second daughter of Ling Third Master is about your age and there\u2019s nothing to say about her looks other than that she\u2019s as beautiful as a fairy. She really admires you after hearing about you. How about that? Such an opportunity comes only once in a blue moon!\"</p><br/><p>Jiang Wei said in all seriousness, \"Stop joking with me, A Jinai. What have I accomplished? I\u2019m unworthy of her.\"</p><br/><p>Instead of getting angry, A Jinai smiled. \"In the past, definitely not. But your prospects are boundless now that you are likely to win success and recognition in future. It\u2019s not at all strange that the Ling family thinks highly of you.\"</p><br/><p>Jiang Wei shook his head. \"I\u2019ve no intention of talking about love matters now.\"</p><br/><p>\"This is not about love.\" A Jinai wiped the smile off his face and said solemnly, \"You must know that there will not be such a chance again if you miss it. You need to get recognition from the Elders Guild, but your current background is not good enough. You can only enter a noble position if you marry Ling Third Master\u2019s second daughter and borrow her power.\"</p><br/><p>Jiang Wei remained silent.</p><br/><p>A Jinai couldn\u2019t help but try to persuade him earnestly once more, \"You\u2019ve been through many things so why are you still so naive? How can you be safe in this chaotic, tough world when you are all alone with no backing from anyone? You\u2019re far from the center and are unaware of lots of insider news. You do know of God-subduing Peak right?\"</p><br/><p>Jiang Wei nodded. \"I\u2019ve seen it.\"</p><br/><p>A Jinai added, \"What do you think of it?\"</p><br/><p>Jiang Wei replied with a low voice, \"Treasure of the nation!\"</p><br/><p>\"That\u2019s right,\" A Jinai gave a nod. \"A few of those on the front line will provide a solid defense. The next few years will be for the avalon to recuperate and accumulate strength. Rebuilding the lesser Avalon of Five Elements and Thirteen Divisions are two of the agendas. The top priority is Master\u2019s Glory.</p><br/><p>\"Five hundred high-aptitude youngsters with sufficient moral characters will be selected in the so called Master\u2019s Glory to receive special training from Elders Guild and eventually become Masters.\"</p><br/><p>\"How is this possible! How can a Master be cultivated so easily?\" Jiang Wei shook his head.</p><br/><p>A Jinai questioned, \"The power of Elders Guild is unfathomable. It\u2019s not something we can figure out. Take God-subduing Peak for example, have you ever imagined that something like this could actually be made?\"</p><br/><p>Jiang Wei was quiet.</p><br/><p>God-subduing Peak was indeed very impressive . As a seasoned soldier with rich experience, he knew very clearly that if this big fellow were to be on the frontline, it could be of tremendous use and help.</p><br/><p>\"I might as well share some insider news with you. You\u2019re one of the five hundred seeds. But have you thought about it? What happens when these people appear? How many empty seats will there be after reconstruction of the Thirteen Divisions? It will be difficult to get a good position if you don\u2019t have any backing. You might get eliminated even with good qualifications. I\u2019m not trying to scare you,\" A Jinai watched Jiang Wei attentively before continuing, \"Perhaps other families will find you, but who offers better terms than the Ling residence? Who\u2019s stronger than them? Ling residence is an influential family with a seat in Elders Guild.\"</p><br/><p>Jiang Wei asked all of a sudden, \"Is Ai Hui one of the seeds?\"</p><br/><p>With Jiang Wei looking straight at him, A Jinai hesitated a little before shaking his head. \"No.\"</p><br/><p>\"But why?\"</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019m not in the position to ask for details,\" A Jinai shook his head before adding, meaningfully, \"I know you\u2019re a sentimental person and you\u2019re not going to like what I\u2019m about to say, but I still have to remind you. Stay away from him if you wanna climb up.\"</p><br/><p>\"I understand.\" Jiang Wei looked calm, without any hint of joy or anger. \"A Jinai, this issue is too important. I\u2019ll need some time to consider.\"</p><br/><p>A Jinai nodded and warned, \"You\u2019re a smart man. I believe you\u2019ll make the right decision. Do not reject an influential families\u2019 symbol of peace. Not now, not ever. This world belongs to them.\"</p><br/><p>\"Thank you, A Jinai.\"</p><br/><p>Jiang Wei walked A Jinai to the door. Seeing A Jinai\u2019s disappearing figure, Jiang Wei turned around and went back into his room.</p><br/><p>He felt that he\u2019d understood certain things.</p><br/><p>He took out a carefully preserved pile of leaves and started writing.</p><br/><p>\u2026..</p><br/><p>\"Dragonrise Training Hall?\"</p><br/><p>Ai Hui read the written challenge over and over again but could not wrap his head around it. \"Lou Lan, have we ever met them?\"</p><br/><p>Lou Lan answered in all certainty, \"No.\"</p><br/><p>\"So they\u2019re just bored?\" Ai Hui tossed the written challenge aside, mumbling to himself, \"Challenging as he pleases? Is there such a thing? Lou Lan, go hang a sign: Five hundred essence elemental beans per challenge.\"</p><br/><p>Fu Yonghao, who was initially just listening in to their conservation couldn\u2019t help but jump in, \"Five hundred essence elemental beans? Why not just rob somebody?\"</p><br/><p>Ai Hui looked at him as though he was looking at a fool. \"It is tiring to rob. How good is it to have people bringing money to our doorstep!\"</p><br/><p>Fu Yonghao became flustered. \"You\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Ai Hui turned around and asked the Three Smalls, \"Is he done with his training?\"</p><br/><p>\"No,\" they shook their heads in harmony.</p><br/><p>Harboring ill intentions, Ai Hui instructed, \"I\u2019ll double your trainings if he doesn\u2019t finish his today.\"</p><br/><p>Fu Yonghao blew up. \"Despicable\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Before he could finish his words, he was manhandled by three pale-faced kids. They were aware that Teacher meant every word he said and definitely wasn\u2019t joking.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui shook his head, muttering, \"There\u2019s a problem.\"</p><br/><p>He was in the limelight for recently defeating the Sha family so what kind of concussed brains would want to find trouble with him at this point in time?</p><br/><p>Unless there was a deep feud, ordinary conflicts would not push them to knock on his door now. Ai Hui simply could not believe that they were initiating a battle when there was no strong animosity between both parties. Something must be going on.</p><br/><p>But whether or not that was the case, friendly matches weren\u2019t a problem as long as they came with the money.</p><br/><p>If they weren\u2019t going to pay up but still came over to challenge, he would have to take the money from them himself!</p><br/><p>Ai Hui quickly forgot about this matter.</p><br/><p>The signboard on the hall\u2019s entrance obviously became another hot topic of the city. It was the first time people heard that accepting challenges could actually be chargeable.</p><br/><p>Everybody was moved by Ai Hui\u2019s money-making talent. He was a natural profiteer and was compulsively money-minded.</p><br/><p>Branch Master Miao had apparently been feeling extremely terrible the last two days and many teachers had been unlucky enough to step on his toes and receive a dressing-down.</p><br/><p>Everyone was very curious as to what would happen to Miao Hai.</p><br/><p>Was he going to pay up? Or not?</p><br/><p>They realized that whether or not he took the money out, it was going to be extremely embarrassing.</p><br/><p>Even gambling dens started to take bets. Will he pay up? Will he challenge successfully? Betters were all eager to find out.</p><br/><p>In regards to these rumors, Ai Hui only smiled and paid no heed to them. He was baffled by another matter.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

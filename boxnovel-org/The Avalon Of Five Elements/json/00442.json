It looked like a huge, invisible wind pillar with circles of ripples raging back and forth within. The guards floated and sank but were unable to struggle free.</p><br/><p>The closer they got the more the interwoven and fluctuating wave motion brought fear and trepidation, even to the old man beside Mayor Qiao Meiqi.</p><br/><p>The wave motion was indistinct and unpredictable. Weaker elementalists were unable to sense it, but the old man felt its threat. Even when sensing unfamiliar forces, Masters would still be able to instinctively detect the danger within.</p><br/><p>Their understanding of force far exceeded ordinary elementalists.</p><br/><p>The old man was rather curious. Who could it be?</p><br/><p>He glanced slightly toward the mayor and wondered to himself, \u2018When had this guy offended such a powerful opponent?\u2019 He had a high position in the Gong residence and was seldom kept from secrets. In this era, however, carelessly antagonizing others wasn\u2019t a wise choice.</p><br/><p>Qiao Meiqi was worried sick, sweat unknowingly surfacing on his forehead. He had a majestic appearance, face squarish and broad, that gave him an air of grandeur even without trying. He was definitely not an ordinary businessman, since it wasn\u2019t easy to build a friendly relationship with the son of an official. Many times he\u2019d made people forget his identity of a great merchant.</p><br/><p>But a hostile enemy of Master level had to enter the city when both consecrated Masters weren\u2019t around. This was worse than the invasion of the Wilderness.</p><br/><p>The dancing and circling grass swords in the sky were like a leisurely swimming arrowfish that carried little malice. Upon seeing the guards\u2019 clumsy moves and blunders, however, a coldness rose from Qiao Meiqi\u2019s tailbone and spread throughout his whole body.</p><br/><p>He tried his best to keep cool, asking, \"Look, what is that?\"</p><br/><p>The old man was knowledgeable, but did not answer immediately. He observed for some time before responding, \"It looks like a kind of sword formation, but one of such scale is rarely heard of.</p><br/><p>\"Sword formation? Isn\u2019t that something from Karakorum Sword League?\" Qiao Meiqi raised his brows, fire flickering in his eyes. \"Could it be Han Li at the bottom?\"</p><br/><p>Hearing Han Li had just caused trouble and seeing Karakorum\u2019s sword formation, it wasn\u2019t surprising that he would associate one with the other. He appeared to be seething, but was actually relieved. As long as they were certain Karakorum Sword League was involved, the Gong residence would not just sit and watch.</p><br/><p>It was only after Karakorum\u2019s chief became Sky Edge Division\u2019s division leader, Karakorum Polaris, that her secret relationship with Madam Ye gradually became apparent.</p><br/><p>Karakorum Polaris did not emerge alone, but brought along newly recruited soldiers.</p><br/><p>As a despot, Qiao Meiqi naturally wasn\u2019t someone with a simple brain. He\u2019d understood that with Great Elder falling sick, Madam Ye was now unstoppably powerful.</p><br/><p>Karakorum\u2019s Han Li\u2019s appearance in Clearwater City made people ponder and question.</p><br/><p>Qiao Meiqi felt calm instead, since Gong Residence would not sit idly as Madam Ye roped them in. Qiao Meiqi had no intention to rely on Madam Ye as well. He had a few decades of friendship with the Gong Residence so the trust they shared was foundationally deep.</p><br/><p>Plus, Qiao Meiqi was clear that Madam Ye\u2019s army was well-trained and powerful and her subordinates were valiant. If he were to go over to her side at this time, he wouldn\u2019t be able to reap much benefits and wouldn\u2019t be much valued, so why would he do that?</p><br/><p>Clearwater City was remotely located, deep within the Wilderness, so within such a short period of time, repairing the situation was beyond Madam Ye\u2019s abilities.</p><br/><p>Han Li\u2019s appearance in Clearwater City\u2026 he\u2019s coming for Gong Residence!</p><br/><p>Qiao Meiqi quickly found the crux and came to a realization. The relationship between the Gong Residence and Madam Ye was already hostile, and now they were establishing themselves in the few aristocratic families, doing as they please without adhering to Madam Ye\u2019s order. This was made apparent when they constructed Palacefield City instead of entering Skyheart City.</p><br/><p>He composed himself. The battle between Gong Residence and Madam Ye wasn\u2019t something a person of his rank should participate in.</p><br/><p>As the target flew closer, the old man and young lady cried out simultaneously.</p><br/><p>\"It\u2019s him!\"</p><br/><p>\"It\u2019s her!\"</p><br/><p>Qiao Meiqi snapped out of it instantly. Were they acquainted?</p><br/><p>In charge of the Yin Yang sword formation, Ai Hui couldn\u2019t help but howl at Iron Lady. \"Done?\"</p><br/><p>He was answered with an even more intensive whisking that sounded like metals clanging, a plaintive lament.</p><br/><p>Finally, a loud crash, surpassing all previous sounds, was heard. Ai Hui breathed a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>While his Yin Yang sword formation was powerful, grass swords were still grass swords and were unable to be sustained for long. He attacked because there was more to gain. It would be embarrassing if things backfired.</p><br/><p>Iron Lady pulled back and returned to Ai Hui\u2019s side without even looking at Yang Wuchang, who was lying unconscious on the ground and bleeding from his nose and mouth.</p><br/><p>Just then, the circling grass swords in the sky started flaming. There were white flames and black flames. In the blink of an eye they turned to ashes.</p><br/><p>That strange, invisible force disappeared all of a sudden and the trapped guards instantly felt their bodies loosen up as the resistance all around vanished completely.</p><br/><p>Below, Ai Hui and Shi Xueman stood back to back, holding a sword and a spear respectively.</p><br/><p>Making such a big scene and disregarding their honor\u2026 no one would take it lying down.</p><br/><p>There was no need to worry about not having the chance to speak. With a sword and with skills, anyone would get a chance to speak up.</p><br/><p>Only weaklings\u2019 voices would be drowned out.</p><br/><p>Without turning his head Ai Hui asked, \"How did it feel?\"</p><br/><p>Shi Xueman replied, \"Very sturdy.\"</p><br/><p>She hesitated for a bit, but added nevertheless, \"That last one was gratifying.\"</p><br/><p>Ai Hui burst into laughter. It was difficult to imagine such words coming out of Iron Lady\u2019s mouth. She sounded like a mischievous little girl who\u2019d just done something naughty.</p><br/><p>The guards in the sky were raging at this point, their eyes on fire. They\u2019d been immobilized by their opponent in the eyes of everyone. It was utterly embarrassing.</p><br/><p>Right at this moment someone shouted, \"Stop it!\"</p><br/><p>The guards who were about to attack turned rigid. That imposing voice was beyond familiar to them. The mayor!</p><br/><p>They turned around and saluted, \"Mayor!\"</p><br/><p>Before Qiao Meiqi could speak, the two old and young people beside him flew down.</p><br/><p>\"Sister Xueman!\"</p><br/><p>\"So it\u2019s you!\"</p><br/><p>The familiarity in their tones made Qiao Meiqi let all his guard down. Wait a minute, Sister Xueman? Who could have a little princess of the Gong Residence address her that way? A name came up to him suddenly, causing his eyes to open wide.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui looked at the luxuriously clothed man in front of him and asked in puzzlement, \"You are...?\"</p><br/><p>He found the old man vaguely familiar looking but had no idea where he might\u2019ve seen him. Even his voice sounded familiar.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Ai Hui had not recognized him the old man was somewhat pleased. \"No recollection eh? I drank some of your porridge before.\"</p><br/><p>Drank his porridge? Ai Hui reacted all of a sudden, his eyeballs about to fall out. \"Volcano Old Man!\"</p><br/><p>The old man smiled in satisfaction. \"Can\u2019t recognize me eh, have I changed a lot?\"</p><br/><p>Ai Hui clicked his tongue in wonder. \"Couldn\u2019t recognize you indeed. You were like a beggar when I last met you, but now you\u2019re acting all elegant. I can tell from one glance that your clothes are expensive stuff!\"</p><br/><p>Upon hearing the words \"acting all elegant\" Qiao Meiqi trembled slightly. He raised his head forcefully and look toward Ai Hui like a madman.</p><br/><p>How dare he say that to a Master? Not just any Master but bad-tempered Venerable Volcano. Was he trying to die?</p><br/><p>What threw him off even more was the fact that Venerable Volcano wasn\u2019t the least bit offended.</p><br/><p>He smiled, saying, \"I have recovered and was able to live on, thanks to your porridge. I wanted to look for you guys after to return the favor but it slipped my mind, hahaha.\"</p><br/><p>He seemed to have felt that forgetting someone else\u2019s kindness wasn\u2019t something to feel embarrassed over.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui did not mind it. He smiled, \"That\u2019s not true. If not for the fact that you guarded the door, we wouldn\u2019t have been able to enjoy the porridge.\"</p><br/><p>Just then, Shi Xueman brought an innocent and unaffected girl over. \"This is Ai Hui, we all call him Ah Hui. This is Yaoyao, Gong Peiyao. She is Uncle Gong\u2019s daughter, we used to play together in the past\"</p><br/><p>Gong Peiyao greeted hurriedly, calling out respectfully, \"Brother Ah Hui.\"</p><br/><p>Ai Hui returned the greeting, \"Yaoyao.\"</p><br/><p>Shi Xueman recognized Venerable Volcano at this point and was rather shocked. \"You changed so much.\"</p><br/><p>Venerable Volcano laughed out loud. \"The young lady\u2019s eyes are working better after all. Better than yours.\"</p><br/><p>Shi Xueman had already pulled Yaoyao to another side.</p><br/><p>\"Lou Lan, this is Yaoyao.\"</p><br/><p>\"Hi, Yaoyao. I\u2019m Lou Lan, very pleased to meet you.\"</p><br/><p>\"Wa, Lou Lan is so cute! Can I hug you, Lou Lan?\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course!\"</p><br/><p>\"Wah, you\u2019re so soft! Do you wanna hug him, Sister Xueman?\"</p><br/><p>\"I\"m not a little girl like you!\"</p><br/><p>\"You don\u2019t want to? Really? He\u2019s so soft and comfortable to hug! Why are you so soft, Lou Lan?\"</p><br/><p>\"There are two reasons. Firstly, I\u2019m made of millesimal soft sand. Secondly, my sand core is constantly optimizing and I can simulate about three thousand four hundred and sixty different sand textures.\"</p><br/><p>\"Lou Lan, Lou Lan! Can you become a bed?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes I can!\"</p><br/><p>Boom, a sand bed appeared before the two of them.</p><br/><p>Gong Peiyao threw herself on it, instantly becoming excited. \"Ahhhhhh so soft! Lou Lan is so amazing! Quick, come up, Sister Xueman!\"</p><br/><p>Shi Xueman was rather tempted, but looking at her surroundings she decided to resist the urge. She coughed, \"Get up quick, Yaoyao. You shouldn\u2019t act like this\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019m not getting up, I\u2019m not getting up, I\u2019m not getting up\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Shi Xueman pulled her up with one hand, ignoring her squirms and struggles. She said, somewhat embarrassed, \"Sorry to have made you suffer, Lou Lan. Yaoyao has always been mischievous.\"</p><br/><p>Lou Lan broke into a wide grin. \"Not at all, I\u2019m very happy.\"</p><br/><p>Qiao Meiqi was now in front of Ai Hui. He spoke cordially, \"I did not expect to see the renowned Lightning Blade over here. Your presence really brings light to my city. I\u2019m deeply honored. My name is Qiao Meiqi and I am guilty of calling myself the mayor. Unable to take care of my people properly, I feel utterly ashamed. Really sorry to have caused you an unhappy experience. Please do me the honor and give me a chance to make up for my negligence.\"</p><br/><p>Yang Wuchang woke up from his coma, but upon hearing the humble tone in which the mayor was addressing them with, he blacked out once again.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Duanmu Huanghun, who had shot to fame after the famous fight, had now become the last disciple of the Grandmaster Dai Gang. Yet none of these made him feel pleased or joyful.</p><br/><p>With his noble upbringing, amazing talent, and handsome looks, and now as the last disciple of the famous master, he really was a favorite of heaven. He was so perfect that no one could even envy him.</p><br/><p>But he was not happy at all!</p><br/><p>That bastard didn\u2019t come to school again!</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun\u2019s heart was full of anger. Yes, anger!</p><br/><p>Today was the first day he had returned to Central Pine City from meeting his master. With the title of a grandmaster\u2019s last disciple, he was shining brilliantly like the sun. The dean had personally came to welcome him again and had even spoken to him obsequiously. The teachers gave him kind and warm greetings, not in the least bit treating him like a student. The male students looked at him with worship and reverence, while the female students stared at him with passionate love.</p><br/><p>But he neither wanted nor cared about any of these!</p><br/><p>The only person he wanted to see, the only person he cared about, was not included in these strangers.</p><br/><p>He wanted to see the unconcealed envy, jealousy, and self-abasement in Ai Hui\u2019s eyes. Yes, he was this practical. He just wanted to see that fellow grovel at his feet under his dazzling fame.</p><br/><p>It would feel great!</p><br/><p>But damn it! That guy didn\u2019t come to school again!</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun\u2019s face was livid with rage. Although his eyes were as cold as ice, an unimpeded fury was burning beneath them.</p><br/><p>It was like a powerful army with a vast host of infantry and cavalry, after planning for a long time, had finally marched directly towards the enemy\u2019s camps in the hope of wiping the enemies out, but found out that the camp was empty.</p><br/><p>The feeling\u2026sucks!</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t listening to a word of what the teachers were saying in the class. For the whole morning, he was in a rage and was like a volcano that could erupt at any time.</p><br/><p>Each minute in the class was similar to torture and made him more and more angry. He felt like he was a foolish clown. The feeling was so intense that he almost couldn\u2019t help but rush out of the classroom.</p><br/><p>However, he somehow managed to restrain himself until the end of the class.</p><br/><p>As soon as the class was over, he stood up and rushed out of the schoolhouse with great haste.</p><br/><p>As he walked outside, he couldn\u2019t help but narrow his eyes in the bright sunlight.</p><br/><p>\"Excuse me, do you know Ai Hui?\"</p><br/><p>As he just passed the school gate, Duanmu heard a soft and gentle voice and suddenly stopped. However, he didn\u2019t stop because of how attractive the voice was, but instead, because of the name.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui\u2026that damned bastard!</p><br/><p>After his eyes adjusted to the sunlight, he could clearly see the person in front of him. His eyes lit up. What a classic beauty!</p><br/><p>The girl stood there gracefully with a demure temperament and a warm smile; she looked so gentle and decent. Duanmu Huanghun had seen countless beauties, but very few of them could be said to be as pleasant-looking as her.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui\u2019s girlfriend?</p><br/><p>Impossible! Duanmu immediately denied the thought. How can Ai Hui have such a pretty girlfriend? His girlfriend was the plain-looking one. The moment the word \"girlfriend\" appeared in his mind, Duanmu\u2019s heart trembled, as he remembered the miserable experience of that night. It was a literal nightmare that he was still trying to forget.</p><br/><p>He never thought he would remember it here\u2026</p><br/><p>Although he was roaring with anger deep inside his heart, Duanmu Huanghun still smiled brightly, and said, \"Nice to meet you, I\u2019m Ai Hui\u2019s classmate.\"</p><br/><p>He decided to paralyze his enemies before infiltrating himself into them!</p><br/><p>\"Wow, that\u2019s great. So glad to meet you. I\u2019m the senior disciple of Ai Hui\u2019s master,\" Mingxiu said, pleasantly surprised.</p><br/><p>Senior disciple of Ai Hui\u2019s master?</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun was also a bit surprised. His attention was immediately caught by this relationship. Ai Hui had a master? How could anyone choose such a terrible guy as a disciple? He began to feel indignant.</p><br/><p>Yet he was calm enough to maintain his composure, and he asked with a big smile and appropriate surprise, \"Ai Hui has a master? I\u2019ve never heard of it before. Why didn\u2019t he share this wonderful news with us?\"</p><br/><p>Mingxiu didn\u2019t think too much, and she answered, \"I presume he didn\u2019t have time to tell you. It was just days ago. His master is Wang Shouchuan, a teacher of Central Pine Academy.\"</p><br/><p>\"Wang Shouchuan? Teacher in our academy?\" Duanmu Huanghun paused for a minute as he quickly searched his memories. \"Is he the one teaching the \u2018Basis for Training\u2019 course?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\" Mingxiu was familiar with Uncle\u2019s course.</p><br/><p>\"I see.\" Duanmu Huanghun instantly became more relieved. It wasn\u2019t surprising; surely no respectable teacher would choose such a terrible disciple. He didn\u2019t think that a teacher who taught \u2018Basis for Training\u2019 would be of high status.</p><br/><p>Now much happier, Duanmu Huanghun acted impressed and said, \"He is a good teacher. Ai Hui is fortunate to have him as his master. \"</p><br/><p>Hearing his compliment, Mingxiu\u2019s positive impression of Duanmu became reinforced. She had learned embroidery from Master ever since she was very young, and just like her master, Uncle was like kin.</p><br/><p>\"So you and Ai Hui know each other well?\" Mingxiu asked curiously.</p><br/><p>\"Very!\" Duanmu replied. He gnashed his teeth in anger but managed to give a bright smile. \"We are on the same mission team.\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh, then you must be good friends.\" Mingxiu was also happy to know this. The members of a mission team generally consisted of very good friends who could closely cooperate.</p><br/><p>\"Yes, yes.\" Duanmu\u2019s smile became brighter, but in his heart, he wished to stab Ai Hui to death.</p><br/><p>Oops, no. Stab? How could he be so cruel to his \"good friend\"?</p><br/><p>He should hack him into pieces to resolve his hatred!</p><br/><p>\"Oh, I don\u2019t know your name yet,\" Mingxiu said.</p><br/><p>Duanmu thought furiously to himself. Should he tell her his real name? No! He was too famous these days, and as a celebrity, he would be recognized if she knew his true name. Then she would know that he was lying because Ai Hui must have bad-mouthed him in front of her.</p><br/><p>Why not give her a pseudonym?</p><br/><p>Without thinking, Duanmu Huanghun blurted out, \"Just call me Bangwan.\"</p><br/><p>The next moment he realized what he said, and he felt like killing himself.</p><br/><p>He almost cried out. Just what did he do?</p><br/><p>\"Oh, hello, Bangwan!\" Mingxiu said heartily.</p><br/><p>Hearing the familiar yet horrifying name again, tears welled up in Duanmu\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\"Yes, yes,\" he replied torpidly.</p><br/><p>This self-abasement was just too harsh.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

On it was a\ndevilish, yet alluring, colored spot. It was An Muda\u2019s last \u201cgift\u201d to\nhim. The blood spiritual force within his body flowed to his arm area\nonly to be resisted by an invisible force and was unable to pass through\nit.</p><br/><p>The colored spot was formed from tangled five elemental rings. They\nwere connected, head to tail, like a lock. They were like a ball of\nflowing bright light, constantly undergoing changes.</p><br/><p>The Holy Emperor had been unable to break this \u201cAn Muda Ring.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yes, the Holy Emperor named it the \u201cAn Muda Ring.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Holy Emperor was wise, knowledgeable, and had seen all kinds of\nabsolute arts that elementalists practiced, so he was extremely familiar\nwith five elemental rings. He understood that these rings were a new\nMaster\u2019s first barrier. Only those who could comprehend them could\npossibly progress further.</p><br/><p>The An Muda Ring was different from those he had seen before. It had\nlife. It could grow and change, regrouping and repairing itself. It\nflowed endlessly, never ever stopping.</p><br/><p>It was breathtaking, amazing, and magnificent.</p><br/><p>The Holy Emperor disapproved of An Muda\u2019s ways, but was exceedingly impressed by the An Muda Ring.</p><br/><p>Breaking the An Muda Ring would allow him to heal from his injuries,\nbut more importantly, he would be able to further advance his level.</p><br/><p>Grandmasters reigned supreme not only because of their powers, but\nalso due to their solitude. It was extremely cold at the top, and such\nwas their lives as Grandmasters. This loneliness wasn\u2019t just something\nthat few battled together against. It was also something they\nexperienced during training.</p><br/><p>There were fewer and fewer things they could use as references. There\nwere also fewer people whom they could learn from and discuss matters\nwith. Loneliness hit them the most when they pondered over their next\ndestination.</p><br/><p>Ever since the battle with An Muda, the Holy Emperor had stayed away\nfrom governmental affairs and spent practically every waking hour\nattempting to understand the An Muda Ring.</p><br/><p>The An Muda Ring caused him to spend a lot of time and energy, but\nthe output was worth the effort. Seeing through An Muda\u2019s ideology was\npriceless. The Holy Emperor looked forward to the day when he could\nfinally solve the riddle. He was curious about the essence of the An\nMuda Ring.</p><br/><p>And that day was near.</p><br/><p>Compared to being on the front lines, he was much happier using his time to study the An Muda Ring.</p><br/><p>Peeking into the insights of a Grandmaster was like exploring a whole new world.</p><br/><p>He opened his eyes suddenly.</p><br/><p>As he left his room, the sun was rather glaring, but it did not seem to affect him.</p><br/><p>The guards were shocked to see him, but they quickly bowed. \u201cYour Majesty!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ignoring them, the Holy Emperor flew up into the sky and stopped\nsomewhere high above. He had a grave expression on his face as he kept\nhis gaze in the direction of the Jadeite Forest.</p><br/><p>Such an intense wave motion\u2026 Dai Gang\u2026 Who else?\u201d</p><br/><p>A new Grandmaster???</p><br/><p>\u2026..</p><br/><p>It was a lively scene in Skyheart City. As people rushed out from\ntheir houses, some flew up into the sky, while others stood on their\nroofs. They were all looking toward the Jadeite Forest. They craned\ntheir necks despite the futility.</p><br/><p>There were mixed emotions on their faces. It was indeed hard to remain calm at this point.</p><br/><p>The indescribable elemental wave motion had already disrupted the flow of heaven and earth.</p><br/><p>Rays of magnificently colored, fluctuating lights appeared far away\nin the horizon. Bright light traces flashed across the blue dome of\nheaven from time to time. They were like falling meteors, caused by\nfriction between surging elemental energy. The white, cottony clouds\nwere crackling and burning, as if ignited by something, and producing a\nthick green smoke. The sun and moon were simultaneously visible as they\nreleased their radiance.</p><br/><p>All kinds of strange phenomena were occurring.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmasters are freakishly terrifying!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the other fellow aside from Dai Gang?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt has to be Senior Le Buleng! Have you forgotten that he had specially made a trip down to challenge Dai Gang to battle?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. He\u2019s probably the only worthy opponent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have to call him Grandmaster Le!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAn Muda might\u2019ve been too old. Grandmasters Dai and Le are still in their prime.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine how powerful a human can become. Even if the\nwhole population of Skyheart City joined forces, they wouldn\u2019t be able\nto resist a hit from two grandmasters, would they?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDefinitely not!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Madam Ye held her head up high, more arrogantly and stubbornly than\nusual. She was the only one aware that her body was trembling\nuncontrollably beneath her luxurious clothes. She appeared calm, but\nbehind her sealed lips, wisps of blood from clenching her teeth too hard\nleaked from her gums. A bloody smell pervaded the air as she stared in\nthe direction of the Jadeite Forest.</p><br/><p>Are Grandmasters really invincible?</p><br/><p>She even felt a tinge of despair and confusion. Having seen An Muda\u2019s\nlast strike, she had thought that that was a Grandmaster\u2019s power and\nhad spent so much effort in establishing Master\u2019s Glory. This gave her\nconfidence that Skyheart City would remain fearless even when facing a\nGrandmaster.</p><br/><p>It was only now that she realized how naive she had been.</p><br/><p>Those forces were of a different realm!</p><br/><p>Even quantity wouldn\u2019t be able to compensate for the disparity in power.</p><br/><p>Madam Ye broke out in cold sweat. Her belief that Skyheart City was impregnable had been threatened, and she felt insecure.</p><br/><p>Le Buleng was surrounded by dark flames and looked akin to a devil\nrising from Hell. The curling flames were pitch-black and seemed capable\nof swallowing all light. The restless fire danced with a distinct\nrhythm, like that of a pulse. Occasionally, they would form transparent\nripples that spread outward in the sky.</p><br/><p>The ripples carried a terrifying power and might that reached far and wide.</p><br/><p>If Le Buleng was hellfire, Dai Gang would be a gust of unfathomable wind. He was always cheerful and light-hearted.</p><br/><p>The ripples produced by the black flames did not affect his physical\nbody. They continued spreading into the distance, as if he was merely an\nillusion.</p><br/><p>Le Buleng had battled against Dai Gang many times and was very\nfamiliar with his skills, hence he unleashed his full force immediately\nwithout any warning.</p><br/><p>His body disappeared swiftly in midair. Instantly and out of nowhere, a flaming black fist appeared from behind Dai Gang.</p><br/><p>Lustrous lotus flowers grew and blossomed behind Dai Gang\u2019s back just\nin time for the petals to roll outward and wrap around Le Buleng\u2019s\nflaming fist, effectively blocking it.</p><br/><p>Whoosh. The petals turned into ashes and dust.</p><br/><p>Dai Gang used this opportune moment to break free, a startled expression forming on his gentle face. \u201cThese flames\u2026 Yin Flames!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t hide it from you indeed!\u201d</p><br/><p>A cold groan sounded from far away as a sharp force appeared noiselessly by Dai Gang\u2019s ears.</p><br/><p>His eyes lit up. \u201cI see. Golden Crow Fire generates Yin after nonstop\ntempering and upgrading. Amazing stuff. These Yin Flames can even\ncombust in a void right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Both moved as fast as lighting. Throughout a brief exchange of conversation, both had exchanged blows at least tens of times.</p><br/><p>The effect produced by two colliding forces that were entirely\ndifferent also differed. At times these clashes disappeared without a\nsound, but at other times, they were earth-shatteringly loud like\nthunder.</p><br/><p>Le Buleng became excited because he could feel that their current fight was different from the previous ones.</p><br/><p>That powerless feeling he had felt when facing Dai Gang was like a nightmare that enveloped his whole life.</p><br/><p>He had thought that they were the shackles of fate, but he was finally going to crush them!</p><br/><p>He burst into a laughter. \u201cIt feels good!\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Gang retracted his smile and adopted a stern expression. \u201cBrother\nBuleng is rebelling against destiny for sure, establishing supreme\nabsolute arts, and passing them onto the new generations. May I ask for\nits name?\u201d</p><br/><p>Le Buleng was surprised, but after some thought he mumbled, \u201cI forgot about naming it. Eh, let me call it [Yin Furnace].\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Gang praised, \u201cGreat name! If Brother Buleng loses, I\u2019ll be sure\nto pass it on to the noble disciplines. If anything goes wrong, I\u2019ll\nentrust the gifted ones to hand it down and carry it forward, ensuring\nthat this treasure does not collect dust.\u201d</p><br/><p>Le Buleng laughed out loud. \u201cI\u2019ve been living life my own way, and nothing matters when I\u2019m dead, so who cares?\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he finished, his body appeared beside Dai Gang as he threw another punch.</p><br/><p>Dai Gang\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cThere are ripples in this empty space!\u201d</p><br/><p>A lotus flower blossomed behind his back to block the blow.</p><br/><p>Whoosh. The flower burned to ashes. The black flames then surged forth toward Dai Gang\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>Nothing much could be seen, but Dai Gang\u2019s body withdrew speedily.\nHis open hands and fingers were like blossoming flowers. It was a\ndazzling sight for all to see.</p><br/><p>The bowl-sized lotus flowers spiraled rapidly toward the surging, curtain-like smoke.</p><br/><p>Bububu\u2026</p><br/><p>The flower petals exploded into balls of light. Amid the light were pattering sounds generated by fine rain.</p><br/><p>The seemingly soft rain had actually managed to disrupt the momentum of the black smoke.</p><br/><p>Just then, a fist pierced through the rain curtain!</p><br/><p>Dai Gang\u2019s pupils shrank. He extended his palms out and struck out. A\ndeluge of petals fluttered in the sky as heavenly music filled the air.\nIt was as if a deity had descended.</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>The petals turned into fine powder in an instant, and the heavenly music stopped abruptly.</p><br/><p>The light ray that blossomed between them was so dazzling that it\nhurt to watch, and it was accompanied by a fiery explosion of elemental\nwave motions.</p><br/><p>Le Buleng only felt a burst of overwhelming force approaching. Before\nhe could react, his body shot backward like a ball for miles before he\ncould stabilize himself.</p><br/><p>He looked at the criss-crossing wound on his fist and grinned. There was only madness in his eyes.</p><br/><p>That felt good!</p><br/><p>The ground beneath him was a long crack that was three kilometers\nwide and over ten kilometers long, as if it were a valley.. This was the\nghastly scar, left behind by that earlier blow.</p><br/><p>Behind Le Buleng, the accumulated soil had created a dust storm that covered the sky and still whirled in the air.</p><br/><p>It swept far across the field, extending a thousand miles away!</p><br/><p>Le Buleng shifted his gaze toward where Dai Gang was standing.</p><br/><p>Dai Gang was in a worse state. His palms were missing from his lower\narms and astonishingly severe wounds could be found all over his body.</p><br/><p>Le Buleng hardened his gaze. There were no bones sticking out of Dai Gang\u2019s arms.</p><br/><p>No bones?</p><br/><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been injured in a long time. Almost forgot what it feels like,\u201d Dai Gang mumbled and raised his head up with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re amazing indeed, Brother Buleng. The first to ever force me to unleash my true potential. How interesting!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

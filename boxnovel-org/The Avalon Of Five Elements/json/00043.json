Why were his hands and feet all soft and his body so sore? Was he sick?</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun opened his eyes with much effort. Through his hazy vision, he saw quite a number of human-shaped figures surrounding him from above.</p><br/><p>Could it be that the senior leadership was here to visit him out of concern for his illness?</p><br/><p>The sounds around him gradually became more distinct.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, what an exhibitionist!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s really not wearing any clothes at all! Heavens, our school actually has people like that!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould he be a rapist? Maybe he was caught in adultery?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Not wearing any clothes\u2026feeling cold from head to toe\u2026</p><br/><p>When realization dawned upon Duanmu Huanghun, he forced his eyes open. His face was planted on the ground, and he was surrounded by a large number of legs. The cooling sensation all over his body made him freeze in horror. All he wanted to do now was to dig a hole and hide in it.</p><br/><p>Too\u2026too vicious!</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun almost stopped breathing. The unwanted attention made him utterly embarrassed. He had never, in his entire life, experienced such helplessness before. He felt that his life was now dark beyond compare.</p><br/><p>That nefarious Ai Hui and his partner in crime were simply too ruthless!</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun suddenly remembered that he was wearing an elemental energy mask and was hence unrecognizable. He let out a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>He needed to escape, immediately!</p><br/><p>He could sense that the surrounding crowd was constantly growing larger, but the elemental energy within his body was not responding to his commands. He was filled with regret. Why did he have to pick a fight with Ai Hui when his own strength was sapped?</p><br/><p>He forcefully activated his natal residence, disregarding the consequent internal injury and the fact that he would need half a month to heal.</p><br/><p>The onlookers\u2019 vision blurred as the naked figure on the ground vanished.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, an expert!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPublic decency is dying with each passing day! How can such an expert be so shameless?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need to lodge a complaint with the administration! That pervert must be caught!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026...</p><br/><p>Pervert!</p><br/><p>When he heard the mob\u2019s angry cries behind him, Duanmu Huanghun spat out a mouthful of hot blood. His internal injury immediately became more severe.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui, you\u2019d better watch out!</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun gritted his teeth.</p><br/><p>\u2026...</p><br/><p>Vanguard Training Hall.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui drew himself up, preparing to listen to Shi Xueman\u2019s description of the target; after all, he had absorbed her Calming Indigo Silk. Even though the sword embryo was to blame, Ai Hui felt truly apologetic. Furthermore, the noodle shop girl did not seem to be capricious and was, in fact, a pretty decent person.</p><br/><p>If he was in her shoes, he would chop the person who took his eighty million into mincemeat without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>Since it was his mistake, there was nothing more to be said. Ai Hui knew the value of eighty million yuan; he was not some naive kid who knew nothing about the real world.</p><br/><p>The noodle shop girl\u2019s good temperament was reflected in the fact that she did not get physical, in spite of possessing such power.</p><br/><p>He was thus very serious about accomplishing his task.</p><br/><p>Noticing Ai Hui\u2019s sincerity, Shi Xueman had a somewhat better impression of him. She began to list down the target\u2019s characteristics, counting the points with her fingers. \u201cHe is proficient in close quarters combat, highly experienced in real combat, and has a vicious fighting style.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui instantly knew that this young lady didn\u2019t have much experience. \u201cThe information you have given is too general. Do you have his name? Maybe his age? How tall is he? Is he fat, skinny or well-built? Did he have anything unique about him? Perhaps some kind of deformity or disability? What about his hair and skin color?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shi Xueman realized that Ai Hui wanted more specific details. She quickly responded, \u201cIt was during a blind battle, and he didn\u2019t leave his full name. He is most probably a youngster. His height and build were rather similar to yours. As for other special characteristics\u2026that\u2019s right, he had a lot of strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui shook his head. \u201cStill too little information.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shi Xueman was slightly anxious. She clenched her teeth and racked her brain. Suddenly, her eyes lit up as she offered, \u201cOh, and he was very powerful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow powerful? What was his base level?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPossibly more powerful than me.\u201d She then added, \u201cNot much stronger but not much weaker either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui nodded and agreed, \u201cThat does narrow our search down by quite a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was not simply shooting his mouth off. The power that she had exhibited earlier had sent a lingering fear crawling up his spine\u2014even someone as arrogant as Duanmu Huanghun was beaten to a pulp.</p><br/><p>He reflected for a while, before asking prudently, \u201cWhat\u2019s your base level? It\u2019s fine if you\u2019re not willing to share.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shi Xueman replied spontaneously, \u201cI have achieved six palaces.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAbsolute arts?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though Ai Hui had already known she was fierce and powerful, discovering her base level still made him involuntarily suck in air through his teeth.</p><br/><p>This girl...even Fatty would not dare to tell her that the debtor is the boss!</p><br/><p>Ai Hui was glad that he had no plans to renege on his debt; otherwise, he might have already ended up in the sewers as a pile of dregs.</p><br/><p>He sighed lightly, hiding his astonishment. \u201cThe target must be a renowned expert, further limiting the scope of our search.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little did he expect the seemingly ordinary girl from the noodle shop to shake her head and disagree. \u201cNo! I am very familiar with all the renowned experts of the Induction Ground, and he is not one of them. The target is definitely a new student, someone who I have not traded blows with before.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui\u2019s mind buzzed; the hidden implications of her words are rather frightening. What did she mean by being \u201cfamiliar with the renowned experts?\u201d Judging from the phrase \u2018not traded blows with before\u2019, they were definitely more than just acquaintances.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, she had said it with absolute certainty. Didn\u2019t that imply that she had sparred with them before?</p><br/><p>Ai Hui felt his mouth turn dry. How unlucky must he be to owe someone so powerful eighty million yuan!</p><br/><p>He took a deep breath, trying to remain calm. \u201cHow could any of the new students possibly have such a base level of six palaces?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d she countered, disagreeing. \u201cFor all we know, he could have a strange character and prefers to keep a low-profile. Maybe he enjoys preying on the weak.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui considered the idea for a while. \u201cIn other words, the target is a new student, who is actually an expert, with a build similar to mine. Also, his base level might be of six palaces or possibly even higher, knows an absolute art, has a vicious fighting style, and is proficient in blind battling as well as submission moves.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat should be about it!\u201d Shi Xueman was very pleased.</p><br/><p>Although he was young, Ai Hui\u2019s maturity, calmness, and attention to detail left her highly satisfied.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui decided to first temper her expectations. \u201cI will put my best effort for this task, but luck usually plays a large role in finding someone. I cannot guarantee success.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Shi Xueman casually replied. \u201cYou owe me eighty million yuan anyway, and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll find plenty of things that you can do to pay off the yearly interest. As for reneging on your debt, nobody in the entire Induction Ground has dared to do such a thing to me before.\u201d</p><br/><p>The noodle shop girl\u2019s callous words made the hairs on the back of Ai Hui\u2019s neck stand on end.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui swallowed hard. \u201cWhat about the swordplay coaching?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI should be in the city once per fortnight. When the time comes, I\u2019ll look for you here.\u201d Shi Xueman observed her surroundings. \u201cIt just so happens that this is also a training hall. I\u2019ll notify you one day in advance. Luckily there\u2019s a message tree too, so keep a look out for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMessage tree?\u201d Ai Hui had no idea of what she was talking about.</p><br/><p>Shi Xueman could tell that Ai Hui was clueless. She pointed at a seemingly unremarkable tree in the corner of the yard and explained, \u201cThat is a message tree. The leaves of a message tree are different from those of a normal tree, as every single leaf has the same pattern of veins. When it receives a message, the tree drops one of its leaves with the message written on it. It is a wood elemental technique. Did you not learn this in class?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui was astounded. He had not noticed anything special about that tree despite having swept the courtyard many times.</p><br/><p>Shi Xueman walked to the message tree and plucked one of its leaves. She produced a book seemingly out of nowhere.</p><br/><p>She opened the book and placed the leaf on one its pages, and a warm glow soon enveloped the leaf.</p><br/><p>Shi Xueman suddenly cried out in shock.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

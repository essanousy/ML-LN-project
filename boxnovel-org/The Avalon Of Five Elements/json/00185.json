His stone-cold eyes looked at us as though we were lambs sent to be slaughtered. He was supposedly one of the students from the academy, but I was pretty sure that his name had never appeared on the top two hundred lists. Perhaps he had some unique capabilities? Who knew! Regardless, he appeared to be a cold-hearted person, like someone who might send us to our deaths. I wished that the one leading us was the respectable Shi Xueman and not this nameless person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014 Taken from\u300aHuo Yuanlong\u2019s Diary\u300b</p><br/><p>The tender youths standing in front of Ai Hui reminded him of the coolie that he had been three years ago.</p><br/><p>Without any trace of elemental energy, coolies out in the Wilderness were just like paper dolls and were meant to be treated as cannon fodder. In the face of the blood disaster, these relatively formidable yet inexperienced students were not much stronger than the coolies out in the Wilderness. They were pretty much just cannon fodder as well.</p><br/><p>Winning with numbers alone wasn\u2019t going to be possible anymore. Now was the time for experts to shine.</p><br/><p>A Grandmaster would be much more useful than everyone in Central Pine City combined. If the city had just a Grandmaster, they probably would have escaped by now.</p><br/><p>It was a pity that there weren\u2019t any in Central Pine City.</p><br/><p>Besides making use of numbers, the city had no other tactics available. It was as though the humans were mimicking the blood ants\u2019 use of group tactics. In today\u2019s Central Pine City, humans were not much better than beasts.</p><br/><p>Newly formed groups of one hundred people each were gathered on the streets. The leaders were shouting at the top of their lungs and waving their arms in an attempt to drum up the troops\u2019 morale.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui could see the fear hidden beneath their impassioned faces.</p><br/><p>Chaos and despair filled the air as the darkness of night engulfed the black smoke that was rising everywhere.</p><br/><p>Collapsed walls and houses blocked parts of the streets while bricks were strewn all over. Dried bloodstains were everywhere and the air reeked strongly of blood and smoke. The jack-o\u2019-lanterns that neatly lined both sides of the streets were now badly damaged and scattered about, making the street sides look like combs with missing teeth. The remaining lanterns radiated a haunting, feeble glow, casting shadows throughout their street. Central Pine City had undergone a drastic change.</p><br/><p>He had never seen anything like this, not even in the Wilderness.</p><br/><p>At the warehouse, Ai Hui queued for half an hour before he managed to meet the frantic officer-in-charge. The officer immediately recognized Ai Hui, who had left a deep impression the last time they\u2019d met.</p><br/><p>\u201cHardly anything good is left, although you can pick out two items. I\u2019d advise you to hurry.\u201d</p><br/><p>The officer gestured towards the long line.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui knew he didn\u2019t have the time to slowly saunter in and pick out items. He directly replied, \u201cAlright. I\u2019ll need a weapon for a fire elementalist, something like a fire jug.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor that fatty?\u201d the officer asked. The officer\u2019s memory seemed to be very good, but he remembered Fatty because he too had left a deep impression when he\u2019d put on the Steady Mountain.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Ai hui answered, nodding.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa, you guys are in luck,\u201d said the officer, laughing. \u201cThere\u2019re no more fire jugs, but we do have a fire vat. Nobody has taken it because it\u2019s so heavy, but I think it\u2019s very suitable for him.\u201d</p><br/><p>The officer brought Ai Hui to a corner of the warehouse and pointed to a huge vat that was almost as tall as he was. Ai Hui instantly understood why nobody wanted to use it, it was simply too big. The vats that fire elementalists used were more expensive the smaller they were. Fire gourds were one of the smallest types but were very expensive, so most fire elementalists used fire jugs.</p><br/><p>Standing before Ai Hui was practically a wine jar.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it useful?\u201d Ai Hui asked skeptically.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d the officer replied matter-of-factly. \u201cIt may be huge, but it\u2019s good stuff. Besides being a little bit heavy, it doesn\u2019t have any other shortcomings.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui almost rolled his eyes at the officer. Being heavier and larger were huge shortcomings. He pictured Fatty donning the Steady Mountain armor, raising the tower shield, and lugging this huge vat on his back. This getup would be a bit too\u2026 indescribable!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is really something good!\u201d the officer exclaimed discontentedly as he noticed Ai Hui\u2019s skeptical look. \u201cThe artisan who made this had intended to create a Heaven-grade weapon, but ultimately failed. He then used its core to forge this fire vat. If you look carefully you can see an inscription on it, it\u2019s not something I made up.\u201d</p><br/><p>He pointed to the fine print on the side of the vat.</p><br/><p>If it was someone else who had suspected him like that, he would\u2019ve thrown that person out long ago; however, he remembered Ai Hui and understood that the two of them must be quite capable to have survived until now.</p><br/><p>Upon hearing that it was a product resulting from a failed Heaven-grade weapon, Ai Hui immediately agreed. \u201cI\u2019ll take it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Heaven-grade weapons were high-grade arms created for elementalists to use. In order to distinguish them from treasures of the past, they were named as such because they were created in the Avalon of Five Elements.</p><br/><p>Shi Xueman\u2019s spear was one such weapon.</p><br/><p>Heaven-grade weapons possessed mystical powers and were able to greatly enhance an elementalists\u2019 fighting prowess. Wielding these weapons was, however, highly taxing on the user, usually requiring at least the completion of eight palaces. In other words, one pretty much had to be a full-fledged elementalist to use one.</p><br/><p>Shi Xueman was unable to unleash even one percent of her spear\u2019s true power.</p><br/><p>The materials required for forging a Heaven-grade weapon had to be of the highest quality. This was why Ai Hui immediately agreed to take the vat after hearing that it had been created from a failed Heaven-gradel weapon.</p><br/><p>The complex techniques and high-quality materials required to forge a Heaven-grade weapon were the reasons why their prices never fell. Ai Hui had seen many great elementalists in the Wilderness, but had only seen a handful of them wielding Heaven-grade weapons.</p><br/><p>The warehouse officer was satisfied with Ai Hui\u2019s quick answer. \u201cWhat else do you need?\u201d he asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpiderweb Iron Pellets, Wolftooth Heavy Arrows, and chillies.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpiderweb Iron Pellets? For Miss Sang? She should be able to use them considering her ability with the bow.\u201d The officer nodded. \u201cThere are around two hundred or so of them left, you can take them all. Trust you guys to think of something so unorthodox.\u201d</p><br/><p>Spiderweb Iron Pellets were about the size of a thumb and didn\u2019t look very different from ordinary iron pellets. As their name suggested, the Spiderweb Iron Pellets, however, contained highly compressed spider webs within. Triggered by elemental energy, the spider web within each pellet would expand upon impact and restrain the target.</p><br/><p>The officer was truly an experienced individual. Ai Hui had indeed requisitioned the pellets for Sang Zhijun. Although Sang Zhijun was more skilled with a bow than Jiang Wei, her fighting strength lagged behind his. As such, Ai Hui had thought of using these pellets to maximize her utility, but hadn\u2019t expected the warehouse to actually still be stocked with them.</p><br/><p>The use of Spiderweb Iron Pellets was uncommon because spider webs weren\u2019t particularly tough. They wouldn\u2019t be so cheap if they had more restraining power.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui didn\u2019t really care about this since he only intended to use them to confuse the enemy.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can only provide you with two quivers of Wolftooth Heavy Arrows,\u201d said the officer, then swiftly continued upon seeing Ai Hui\u2019s intention to retort, \u201cA lot of people still need these. I\u2019m already looking out for you guys by giving two quivers\u2019 worth, the others are only being given one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll take whatever I can get.\u201d Having seen the long line at the door, Ai Hui accepted his explanation.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have any chillies in the warehouse.\u201d The officer was a bit puzzled by the request. \u201cWhy do you need chillies? What a strange request! I\u2019d suggest that you buy some from the spice shops since it\u2019s rare for people to stock up on chillies. I\u2019m sorry, but the mayor prefers sweet foods over spicy ones.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui was disappointed that he couldn\u2019t get the chillies.</p><br/><p>The officer had already left to tend to others. Knowing that he couldn\u2019t get anything more, Ai Hui dragged the huge wine vat out of the warehouse.</p><br/><p>Those who were still queueing up cast sidelong glances at Ai Hui.</p><br/><p>The students gathered in the Vanguard Training Hall had just undertaken one round of gruelling training and were enjoying a well-deserved break.</p><br/><p>Shi Xueman was the one leading the training since Ai Hui had no interest in looking after this group of students.</p><br/><p>Her power and prestige were common knowledge among the students, allowing her to quickly win over their trust.</p><br/><p>She had secretly read many of her father\u2019s books from a tender age and was, as such, better versed in military tactics than the others.</p><br/><p>When Ai Hui had handed them over to her, Shi Xueman had felt a hint of excitement. She finally had the chance to practice what she had been learning since she was young.</p><br/><p>The only thing that she was slightly unhappy about was her assistant. She\u2019d wanted Duanmu Huanghun to be her assistant, but Ai Hui assigned Jiang Wei to the role instead.</p><br/><p>Stealing a glance at Jiang Wei, she had no choice but to admit that Ai Hui was a better judge of people than her.</p><br/><p>Jiang Wei wasn\u2019t as outstanding as Duanmu Huanghun, but he was calm, dependable, patient, and meticulous. Without Jiang Wei\u2019s help, Shi Xueman would have been flustered.</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun was completely immersed in his own practice.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t particularly willing to help out with the students\u2019 training; his dream was, after all, to become a Grandmaster.</p><br/><p>In the past, he hadn\u2019t been sure of his aim in life. Experiencing these cruel battles and facing death had made it much clearer to him \u2013 he wanted to become a Grandmaster, and not just any grandmaster, but the strongest grandmaster ever!</p><br/><p>A depressed mood pervaded the atmosphere during the break. Everyone was apprehensive about the future and a little terrified of the battles to come.</p><br/><p>Fear and confusion made the students restless.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do we have to listen to Ai Hui\u2019s orders?\u201d Huo Yuanlong asked, just loud enough for everyone around to hear.</p><br/><p>He had done it on purpose. Having consistently been among the top ten students in the academy, he was unhappy that he had to listen to the orders of a first-year student. It was fine if someone like Duanmu Huanghun was the one in charge, but not if the leader was an unknown like Ai Hui.</p><br/><p>Huo Yuanlong had secretly observed Ai Hui earlier while the dean had been speaking. He didn\u2019t see anything special about Ai Hui.</p><br/><p>The only thing that had left an impression on him was Ai Hui\u2019s cold gaze. This gaze was, however, also the reason why Huo Yuanlong was so annoyed. Huo Yuanlong simply couldn\u2019t stand being sized up by an unknown junior with such an indifferent gaze.</p><br/><p>Shi Xueman furrowed her brows, Jiang Wei was roused from his rest, and Sang Zhijun shot a glance over upon hearing this. A grin crept onto her lips as she strummed her bowstring like an instrument.</p><br/><p>The atmosphere was heavy.</p><br/><p>Some of the students urged, \u201cYuanlong, mind your words!\u201d</p><br/><p>Huo Yuanlong stiffened his neck and raised his voice. \u201cDid I say something wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun\u2019s was displeased that his practice was interrupted.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m willing to listen to Miss Shi and Huanghun\u2019s orders, but who is Ai Hui to command us?\u201d Huo Yuanlong exclaimed.</p><br/><p>His words resonated with the thoughts of many others, causing an uproar.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, only Miss Shi and Huanghun are qualified!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is this Ai Hui? Where did he come from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d Shi Xueman commanded. She walked towards Huo Yuanlong with Cirrus in hand, her expression solemn. \u201cYou, fall out. Fifty strokes for causing trouble!\u201d</p><br/><p>Huo Yuanlong\u2019s face completely drained of color. He couldn\u2019t understand why Shi Xueman was siding with Ai Hui.</p><br/><p>Fifty strokes\u2026 He trembled and hurriedly called out to Duanmu Huanghun for help. \u201cHuanghun, don\u2019t you have anything to say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Duanmu Huanghun replied as he walked over.</p><br/><p>Huo Yuanlong was filled with relief upon hearing Duanmu Huanghun\u2019s words. \u201cExactly! Tell them what you think, Huanghun. Everyone will listen to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really quite simple.\u201d Duanmu Huanghun sneered, revealing a set of snow-white teeth. \u201cI\u2019ll personally mete out these fifty strokes.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

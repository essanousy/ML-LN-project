A voice boomed out as the pages flipped. \u201cFor the past twenty-two years, embroidery has consistently had a place in the top ten most lucrative occupations within the Avalon of Five Elements.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui\u2019s eyes lit up like the stars in the night sky.</p><br/><p>Even wielding a sword could not captivate him to such an extent.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis has to do with embroidery being applicable across a large number of fields, especially with regards to the handling of plant and leather materials. Due to the high prices of even basic embroidered goods, the sales volume isn\u2019t all that high. One sheet of elemental cloth costs a hundred times more than normal cloth, with the average price over the past ten years being five hundred thousand yuan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui sucked in a breath of cold air. Never had he imagined that one sheet of elemental cloth would cost this much.</p><br/><p>Five hundred thousand!</p><br/><p>Before his debt of eighty million yuan, five hundred thousand yuan was an astronomical figure to Ai Hui. But now, this was the price for only one sheet of elemental cloth!</p><br/><p>Huge profits! Such huge profits!</p><br/><p>Ai Hui\u2019s eyes glowed at the prospect of making so much money. In his mind, he was already running down to his teacher, shouting \u201cTeacher, I want to learn embroidery!\u201d with utmost passion and sincerity.</p><br/><p>These profits were really too much!</p><br/><p>Ai Hui gritted his teeth, controlling himself.</p><br/><p>How could such a lucrative trade possibly exist in this world? Surely it exists so that he may join it!</p><br/><p>How much of the [Twin Weaving Technique] did he remember? Ai Hui had initially embraced the task with an attitude of experimentation, but he had now completely changed his mind. Overcoming this test was a must.</p><br/><p>My head can be chopped off, my blood can be lost, but don\u2019t ask whether or not I would learn embroidery! Let the wind blow, beat the war drums, but I won\u2019t be called Ai Hui if I don\u2019t learn embroidery!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are elemental cloths used for? Why are they worth so much? Is weaving muslin considered as elemental cloth?\u201d Ai Hui asked rapidly.</p><br/><p>\u201cElemental cloths are weaved using elemental energy needles with threads made of materials rich in elemental energy. Elemental cloths are expensive because it is easy to add elemental traces to them. For instance, embroidery can be used to create these traces. Elemental cloths have many uses, including making weapons. Lian Feier, the vice division leader of the North Sea Division, has a weapon called [Dying Peach] that is created through embroidery. Much protective equipment and many armor linings are also made with such cloths, providing a layer of protection against the dire beasts\u2019 elemental energy-charged attacks.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lou Lan returned to his normal form, appearing in front of the heap of yarn.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you referring to these? These balls of yarn have elemental energy and can be used to make elemental cloths. The use of an elemental energy needle, however, is required. Ai Hui, do you know how to do it? Weaving cloth is one of the more profound techniques in embroidery,\u201d Lou Lan said, as he looked at Ai Hui.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no other choice,\u201d Ai Hui stated resolutely. There was no room for negotiation.</p><br/><p>Hearing about the five hundred thousand yuan had steeled his resolve to learn embroidery. If one piece was worth that much, his debt could be settled with a hundred and sixty-four pieces. This quick calculation left Ai Hui feeling momentarily relieved.</p><br/><p>Learning embroidery was suddenly so much more worthwhile.</p><br/><p>[Twin Weaving Technique]\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Ai Hui recalled every detail of Senior Mingxiu\u2019s weaving demonstration. Without the aid of the sword embryo, his thought processes were much slower, but at least he could still remember everything clearly.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui had no intention of borrowing the sword embryo\u2019s seed\u2019s strength for the task ahead.</p><br/><p>He was clear about his stance. The increase in the seed\u2019s power brought with it an even greater sense of obsession.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui maintained a cautious and restrained approach while tapping on the seed\u2019s strength. Regardless of how strong it may be, using power beyond one\u2019s control can easily go south. The sword embryo\u2019s transformation meant that Ai Hui had to now be even more vigilant than before.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know about the [Twin Weaving Technique]?\u201d Ai Hui asked.</p><br/><p>Lou Lan morphed into a book again, its pages flipping rapidly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe [Twin Weaving Technique] was created by Master Han Yuqin when she was nineteen. It is the embodiment of Master Han Yuqin\u2019s skills with the needle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lou Lan\u2019s first sentence deepened Ai Hui\u2019s respect for Master Han Yuqin. Creating a whole new weaving technique at just nineteen years old was no mean feat\u2014she truly was worthy of being a master!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe [Twin Weaving Technique] revolves around the simultaneous coordination of two needles. It works by having one needle lead the other, tapping on the interaction between two needles that are bound by the same elemental energy. Building on the foundations of the [Twin Weaving Technique], Master Han Yuqin developed many other needlework techniques which ultimately culminated in her creation of the [Fish Waterfall] needlework style. It is so named for the enormous number of needles used. She currently holds the record for the greatest number of needles used simultaneously.\u201d</p><br/><p>The rapid book-flipping sounds came to an abrupt stop as Lou Lan returned to his original form. \u201cThat\u2019s all I have, Ai Hui. Master Shao has very few books regarding the embroidery workshop.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui did not hear what Lou Lan was saying. He repeated to himself, \u201cTapping on the interaction between the two needles that are bound by the same elemental energy\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Thanks to the sword embryo\u2019s seed, Senior Mingxiu\u2019s actions were seared into his head, down to the smallest details. If he had not relied on the seed during the demonstration, he surely would have been at a loss. Lou Lan\u2019s words reminded him of some important details that immediately surfaced in his mind.</p><br/><p>So this is how it works\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The sentence had enlightened him, clearing up the fuzzy understanding he had of the concept.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui\u2019s expression became serious.</p><br/><p>Understanding the principles behind the [Twin Weaving Technique] made Ai Hui realize why his teacher wasn\u2019t optimistic about the task. Although the technique\u2019s concepts weren\u2019t exactly complicated, its execution required excellent control of elemental energy.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui\u2019s control of elemental energy was far below the minimum requirements of the technique.</p><br/><p>However, he was not dejected by this revelation; he had no time to lose.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui began his attempt at creating elemental needles. His prior experience allowed him to form the needles much faster this time, and the needles also stabilized quicker. Ai Hui\u2019s learning ability was decent. Once he succeeded with an attempt, he would quickly get the hang of things.</p><br/><p>As he went through all of Senior Mingxiu\u2019s actions, he found a huge problem\u2014he wasn\u2019t able to control the elemental needles from a distance.</p><br/><p>Throughout the entire demonstration, Senior Mingxiu had not used her palms to directly control the elemental energy needles. The theory behind that was simple enough. The densely packed elemental energy was used to form the needles, which were connected to the user via an \u201cinvisible thread\u201d of elemental energy. This \u201cinvisible thread\u201d was created using an extremely thin and faint form of elemental energy that was not only invisible but also undetectable.</p><br/><p>A high level development of elemental energy was needed to be proficient in the detachment of elemental energy needles. In fact, forming the \u201cinvisible thread\u201d was much harder than conjuring the elemental energy needles.</p><br/><p>Elemental energy was Ai Hui\u2019s biggest weakness. Having only just opened his natal residence, he didn\u2019t have enough elemental energy to detach the elemental energy needles from his body.</p><br/><p>But Ai Hui was not willing to give up just like that.</p><br/><p>Five hundred thousand yuan per cloth!</p><br/><p>He was excited by this figure.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui racked his brains, trying to come up with a solution. The [Twin Weaving Technique] required the two needles to simultaneously move along the horizontal and vertical planes, one needle for each plane. Only when the two needles moved in complete coordination could it be considered as the [Twin Weaving Technique].</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t have to match Senior Mingxiu\u2019s speed; a more achievable pace would be adequate.</p><br/><p>While Senior Mingxiu\u2019s demonstration had made the technique look completely effortless and simple, a deeper analysis helped Ai Hui discover its true complexity. The deceptively simple technique actually possessed several intricacies that might leave one feeling at a loss of where to start.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not that easy to earn five hundred thousand yuan after all!</p><br/><p>Ai Hui let out a defeated sigh.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Hey, let me help you. One thousand yuan per hour? That\u2019s yesterday\u2019s price, it\u2019s so dangerous these days! A moment of carelessness will result in a slip and a fall. I\u2019m fine with falling down as my skin is rough and my body\u2019s thick, but your goods are precious and fragile! If they fall to the ground, you will suffer great losses! Let\u2019s make it clear, you will not receive compensation for damaged goods. If you\u2019re sincere about this, then I will be sincere, too. Since we are classmates, I will give you a reasonable price. Two thousand yuan per hour. It will only cost around twenty thousand yuan a day. This will save you a lot of trouble!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty\u2019s face was filled with sincerity. The other party\u2019s backpack resembled a small hill, making it very difficult and heavy to be carried. After a slight hesitation, he agreed to Fatty\u2019s offer. Even though it was rather expensive, it wasn\u2019t much to a wealthy person.</p><br/><p>The fatty was silently rejoicing. This kind of weight was child\u2019s play.</p><br/><p>He happily accepted the money. However, just as he was about to put the money into his pocket, someone\u2019s hand suddenly came from behind and emptied his hand.</p><br/><p>Fatty was stunned, but the next moment his pupils shrunk. This feeling\u2026was too familiar! He immediately turned his body around, kneeled down, and hugged Ai Hui\u2019s legs. He started weeping. \u201cAi Hui, I finally found you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGive us a moment.\u201d Ai Hui forced a smile at the student who had just paid Fatty.</p><br/><p>With a blank expression, he lifted Fatty up with one hand; Fatty\u2019s enormous and cumbersome body seemed to weigh nothing in Ai Hui\u2019s hand. The other hand of Ai Hui\u2019s was searching through Fatty\u2019s body, not leaving a single pocket. Ai Hui was too familiar with where Fatty hid his money, and in less than half a minute, he managed to obtain all of Fatty\u2019s stash.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the money?\u201d Ai Hui asked coldly.</p><br/><p>He had found barely fifty thousand yuan.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui did not idle around, and he plucked off a thorny branch from a nearby cluster of thistles. When Fatty saw the densely-packed thorns on the branch, his face turned pale. An interrogation by torture was about to come.</p><br/><p>However, he did not dare to struggle. He understood Ai Hui\u2019s temperament very well. The more he struggled, the more he would suffer. He was well aware that Ai Hui\u2019s anger stemmed from the fact that he had previously stolen his money.</p><br/><p>\u201cI spent all of it,\u201d Fatty replied honestly. His tone was like a pig that was about to be slaughtered.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou spent it all?\u201d Ai Hui\u2019s tone was flat. A fearful look flashed across Fatty\u2019s face when he saw the thorny branch in Ai Hui\u2019s hand tremble.</p><br/><p>Fatty gulped. He knew he had to settle the issue this time around.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you still remember Pockmark? I\u2019m sure you have forgotten; you never spoke a single word to him. I still remember that in the beginning, when I couldn\u2019t carry so much, he was the one who helped me. I buried his body. His wife never recovered from her illness. His daughter has reached the schooling age. When Pockmark died, I told him that if I came out alive, I would take care of his family.\u201d</p><br/><p>The thorny branch in Ai Hui\u2019s hand stopped moving.</p><br/><p>Pockmark\u2026</p><br/><p>A blurry face appeared in a distant memory. Anguish, fear, ink-black nights and icy winds. Fuzzy memories began to surface in his mind.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui had a vague image of a laborer that had died very early during their time in the Wilderness. Fatty did not remember wrongly\u2014he had not talked to Pockmark at all. Pockmark was not the only one he had never talked to; in fact, he did not talk to anyone except for Fatty.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you remember Old Wei? That guy who liked to brag? I bet you don\u2019t remember him as well. I still remember that when I had just entered the Wilderness, I was always hungry. Old Wei once gave me some food to eat and told me that I am around the same age as his son. The day he died was a rainy day. It was hard to dig a grave in the muddy soil, which was easily washed away by the rain. It took me half a day to bury him properly. He has two children. The younger one has a terminal illness at the mere age of seven. He knew he wouldn\u2019t survive, and hence, he went to the Wilderness. I have sent his family a sum of money. It\u2019s not a huge sum, it\u2019s only forty thousand yuan. Although I survived, I can\u2019t do anything more\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you remember Big Lee\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fatty continued to talk endlessly, without getting to the point. Sometimes he talked until he was out of breath, at times he spoke with agitation.</p><br/><p>The dumbstruck student who had paid him earlier had long been scared off.</p><br/><p>\u201cDuanmu Huanghun! Ahhhhhhh! Am I dreaming?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhhh, quick, pick me some flowers!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, young girls\u2019 shrieks could be heard from behind the nearby trees.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui was shocked speechless.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher Xu, what a coincidence!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Cui Xianzi, you\u2019re bringing your students on an excursion as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly the two of us survived, only the two of us survived!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...At least we are still alive\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The warm, cordial greetings, the somber memories, they all kept interweaving and appearing in Ai Hui\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>He remained stupefied as if he were in a dream.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhile I was burying them, I told them that if I made it out alive, I would take care of their families.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy am I still alive? Why\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The spurt of fresh blood, the pouring rain, the dire beasts feasting on corpses\u2014memories kept flashing through Ai Hui\u2019s mind. His body suddenly became cold, as if an icy bath had been dumped onto him. He clenched the thorny branch so tightly that his fingers turned pale.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t both our classes travel together? We can take care of each other. With an expert like Instructor Zhou, I can feel relieved.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, that\u2019s good! Cui Xianzi is so beautiful! Are you married?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI know you have no money and that brings about a lot of inconveniences. I know I have brought you nothing but troubles. However, you\u2019re an evildoer, and no trouble can stump you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cClassmate Duanmu, do you have a girlfriend?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cClassmate Duanmu, do you want to be friends with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI know I started this. I\u2019m a pig! I\u2019m stupid! I\u2019m a useless person! But I\u2019m still alive. Why am I still alive? I can\u2019t stand it anymore, I really can\u2019t stand it anymore\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry\u2026sorry\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty was speaking gibberish, and his body was trembling. Emotions were flooding his mind in waves.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui suddenly broke free from that ice-cold nightmare and took a few deep breaths. The air was frosty and bone-piercing, but he could feel his body\u2019s temperature begin to rise gradually again.</p><br/><p>Yes, that was a dream, a dream that he had broken free from long ago. He had already abandoned the times of darkness and shadows. He was now pursuing the light and the sunshine. He had begun a new life.</p><br/><p>He was no longer the Ai Hui of the Wilderness. He was stronger, both mentally and physically.</p><br/><p>So...</p><br/><p>With a flick of his wrist, the thorny branch began to batter Fatty.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t get past your conscience, right? You want to be a hero, right? Then why don\u2019t you train harder? Why meddle in other people\u2019s business when you\u2019re not capable at all? Just because you\u2019re alive and they\u2019re dead? So what if you\u2019re alive? Is it something to be proud of? Goddamnit, how are you still alive? You\u2019re not even strong, and you still talk about some goddamn conscience. Do you know you will die sooner or later if you aren\u2019t strong enough? What makes you think that you don\u2019t need to train? What makes you think that you don\u2019t need to become stronger?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have no powers and no money, and yet you still meddle in other people's business. You even drag me down along with you. I\u2019m going to beat you to death!</p><br/><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s weak, he will die. If he\u2019s weak, he will be poor. But if he\u2019s dead, then that\u2019s his problem! Is his family pitiful? Who isn\u2019t pitiful?</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you yourself don\u2019t want to be a pitiful soul, think of ways to become stronger. Do whatever it takes to gain power!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t hide from it, I can\u2019t hide from it, no one can hide from it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cInstructor Zhou, please take good care of me from now on!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry! Leave it to me!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

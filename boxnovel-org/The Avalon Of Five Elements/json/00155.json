Come quickly, some of the leaves on your message tree are glowing, someone has sent a message. Wow, this is really advanced, I\u2019m really excited to be able to see something so advanced. Please understand that it\u2019s the first time a country bumpkin like me has seen something like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Message tree?</p><br/><p>Ai Hui paused for a moment, suddenly recalling the nonsensical words that had previously appeared on one of its leaves.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have no idea who among you are still alive, but I know that no one can stop them. They have already completed the necessary preparations. Everything will change in sixty days. Who will protect the Avalon of Five Elements?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui remembered the message clearly. He had attempted to understand this seemingly nonsensical message several times but to no avail.</p><br/><p>He had felt that the other party was abnormal and should totally see a doctor. Until now, he had thought that the message was just a prank and had buried it somewhere in the back of his mind. However, hearing Fatty mention the message tree reminded him of that message, which he now saw clearly in his head.</p><br/><p>Everything will change...</p><br/><p>Ai Hui inevitably thought of the blood catastrophe. It was most certainly a catastrophe capable of being called an \u2018incredible change.\u2019 Hadn\u2019t Central Pine City and the Induction Ground both already changed drastically?</p><br/><p>Wait a minute! If the blood catastrophe was what the other party was referring to...</p><br/><p>\u201cNo one can stop them\u201d seemed to indicate that the blood catastrophe was set in motion by some people. Ai Hui let out an angry hiss. He had also once thought that this might have been the case.</p><br/><p>The blood poison needed a period of incubation before it could complete its metamorphosis. The Garden of Life was undoubtedly a good choice. Nobody would notice anything different in a forgotten area flooded with all sorts of strange vegetation. Besides the students that went there for excursions, the Garden of Life was desolate and uninhabited. Moreover, there were no powerful dire beasts out there, only wild beasts. Perhaps the blood poison was extremely weak in its early stages?</p><br/><p>The Garden of Life could be said to be an excellent breeding ground for the blood poison, and it had allowed the poison to continuously spread and transform the blood beasts.</p><br/><p>It was already too late by the time the blood poison started to break out. What\u2019s worse was that the Induction Ground did not have any stationed troops from the elite Thirteen Divisions at the time, thus causing them to be unable to adapt quickly enough to fend off the sudden outbreak.</p><br/><p>The number of coincidences made Ai Hui think that the blood catastrophe was planned, but he promptly dismissed the thought after feeling that he might be too paranoid. Who would deliberately make such a blood poison? What good would it do for them? Ai Hui could not think of a good reason.</p><br/><p>But what if the other party really was referring to the blood catastrophe?</p><br/><p>Ai Hui hesitated for a moment, juggling the strange message around in his mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have no idea who among you is still alive\u201d implied that there was a group of people\u2014maybe his friends? It didn\u2019t seem like it though, perhaps it was a group of sorts? \u201cIs still alive\u201d implied that this group of people was either very old or trapped in dire circumstances. Either way, they were people facing death.</p><br/><p>Does the \u201cthem\u201d in the message then refer to the people who initiated the blood catastrophe?</p><br/><p>The thing that didn\u2019t add up was the \u201c60 days\u201d mentioned in the message. Ai Hui had gone on the excursion the next day after receiving the message. The blood poison incident had also come shortly after.</p><br/><p>It had been 32 days since Ai Hui had received the strange message, which meant that the blood catastrophe had started 28 days after the message.</p><br/><p>The sender must have postulated incorrectly.</p><br/><p>Or was he not talking about the blood catastrophe?</p><br/><p>\u201cEverything will change\u201d probably meant that the event would create an impact large enough to alter the Avalon of Five Elements. \u201cWho will protect the Avalon of Five Elements?\u201d insinuated that the change wasn\u2019t going to be a good thing, it was more likely a calamity.</p><br/><p>It was this last sentence that led Ai Hui to think of the blood catastrophe. He couldn\u2019t think of any other event that had the ability to drastically change the Avalon of Five Elements.</p><br/><p>But if it, indeed, referred to the blood catastrophe, the timing was an issue.</p><br/><p>\u201cAi Hui, why are you daydreaming?\u201d Fatty asked as he walked over, deeply concerned. \u201cAre your injuries still not healed? Lan Lan, quickly give Ai Hui a check up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem!\u201d Lou Lan replied, his eyes flashing. \u201cAi Hui is very healthy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui snapped out of his thoughts, mocking himself for overthinking and being paranoid.</p><br/><p>But wait\u2026.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui pointed at Lou Lan and questioned Fatty, \u201cWhat did you call him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLan Lan,\u201d Fatty answered matter-of-factly.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui shivered, clearly grossed out. \u201cLan Lan? Please don\u2019t give me goosebumps. Lou Lan is my sand puppet, you\u2019d better not mangle his name.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty innocently replied, \u201cWhat about Lou Lou?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you not called Dai Dai, then?\u201d Ai Hui could barely spit out those two words.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, you know my childhood nickname!\u201d Fatty exclaimed with his eyes opened wide in surprise. \u201cI\u2019ve never told you this before!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui couldn\u2019t be bothered to continue talking. He pointed to the ironwood shield on the floor. \u201cThis is for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty looked at the ironwood shield lying on the floor, dazed by its great thickness. \u201cAi Hui, are you sure about this? I\u2019m supposed to use this? Ai Hui, I haven\u2019t seen you for just a few months, and you\u2019ve already forgotten my light and graceful fighting style?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLight and graceful? I think you mean hit and run?\u201d Ai Hui sneered and pressed on without giving Fatty a chance to rebut. \u201cI need someone to wield a shield, and I think you\u2019re the most suitable person to do it. We can\u2019t waste all that flesh, now can we?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty replied anxiously, \u201cThis is all fat\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui swiftly interrupted, \u201cAre you doing it? Return me my money if you aren\u2019t going to do it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty slumped his body and pleaded, \u201cAi Hui, we\u2019ve been brothers for so many years\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou still need to return the money!\u201d Ai Hui said bluntly. \u201cIf you cannot afford to pay up then you\u2019d better be my shieldman. You\u2019ll be well fed with noodles and meat, and you can even play with Lou Lan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lou Lan morphed into three words\u2014\u201cplay with you\u201d\u2014that flitted about.</p><br/><p>\u201cLou Lan is such a good boy,\u201d Ai Hui said, smiling at Lou Lan with the warmth of spring. But an expression as cold as winter immediately took over his face when he turned to Fatty. \u201cYou\u2019ve played with this before, time to pick it up again,\u201d he ordered.</p><br/><p>Fatty\u2019s head hung low as he marched unsteadily towards the ironwood shield. The overly-dramatic Fatty looked as if he was part of a funeral procession.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui ignored him and instructed, \u201cLou Lan, make sure he completes all three hundred sets of shield raises. No dinner for him if he misses even a single set.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe one with the surname Ai!\u201d Fatty shouted through clenched teeth. Gone was the Fatty who was filled with despair, he was now a raging brown bear.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem! I will not miss a single count!\u201d Lou Lan said happily, clearly excited to be of help to Ai Hui.</p><br/><p>With a bang, Lou Lan morphed into three \u2018zeroes\u2019 and started to count.</p><br/><p>Seeing Lou Lan\u2019s new form, Fatty\u2019s expression changed to one of dread. Using a flattering voice, he promptly whispered, \u201cLan Lan, think of all the fun we had just now, aren\u2019t we good brothers? Good brothers should help each other out. Come on, help me count a few free sets and I\u2019ll play with you in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty immediately noticed the sand figures changing swiftly, making him beam with joy.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The numbers suddenly returned to zero.</p><br/><p>Fatty was stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cAdd another hundred sets! That\u2019s four hundred sets together! Miss one set and there\u2019ll be no food for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui\u2019s voice boomed from behind. Fatty trembled as Lou Lan displayed \u201c400.\u201d As if he was afraid that Fatty couldn\u2019t see it clearly, Lou Lan doubled the size of the numbers and brought it right in front of his eyes. The sand counter then reset to \u201c000.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all in this together\u2026 crooks working hand in glove with one another.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty ranted on as he brandished the shield.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui took a glance at Fatty and smiled. Ai Hui knew best just how lazy this fellow could be. He would definitely not stand if he could sit, and he definitely wouldn\u2019t sit if he could lie down. One of these days, he would succumb to his laziness.</p><br/><p>All men must die eventually.</p><br/><p>Nobody would have cared if Fatty had just died quietly somewhere, but it was just his luck to have bumped into Ai Hui.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui had a premonition that the blood catastrophe had only just started. The blood beasts outside of the city were growing stronger, while the situation within Central Pine City was worsening. Without the Thirteen Divisions, the only people they could depend on were the teachers, students, and the guards of the training grounds. Was this really enough to repel the beasts?</p><br/><p>Ai Hui wasn\u2019t sure, but he knew that Central Pine City was no longer the peaceful city he once knew. It was now a battlefield.</p><br/><p>Everyone needed to fight for their own destiny.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui knew that Fatty was a coward who would flee at first sight of danger, so he did not mention much else. However, the blood poison had already spread to the Induction Ground, so where could they flee to?</p><br/><p>There was nowhere to run.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui looked at the message tree and saw one of its leaves glowing as if it was breathing. It was the same leaf as before.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui grabbed a pen from his room before walking towards the tree.</p><br/><p>Somehow, he found himself unusually nervous.</p><br/><p>He felt as if a riddle was about to unravel before his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you still alive?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui read the four words several times. He thought about his experiences over the past few days, which now felt like an eternity ago. To be honest, the battle at the Garden of Life hadn\u2019t had much of an impact on him. He was, after all, not new to this game. He might be weak, but he was experienced in combat.</p><br/><p>Witnessing the drastic changes that befell Central Pine City was what truly affected him.</p><br/><p>A dreamscape was shattered.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui could sense the sender\u2019s urgency, so he lifted his pen and began to write.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m still alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>He stared at the black ink fading into the leaf, reminding himself to be as patient and calm as he used to be while hunting dire beasts in the Wilderness.</p><br/><p>A short while later, the leaf on his hand lit up again. \u201cThank the heavens you\u2019re alive! Can you tell me where you are now? How is the Avalon of Five Elements doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui pondered over what to reply before putting his pen to the leaf.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you referring to the blood catastrophe? The situation has gone out of control, with the Induction Ground being dragged into it. Who are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Being cautious, he didn\u2019t reveal his location. He had no idea if the other party was well-intentioned or malicious, trustworthy or otherwise. Also, if the \u201cyou\u201d that was mentioned in the first message referred to a group, they would very likely be enemies with the people who unleashed the blood poison.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui remembered the noodle shop girl telling him that this message tree was ancient.</p><br/><p>He had a feeling that this message tree had a complicated past. The people and circumstances that were entwined with it were definitely not minor characters like himself.</p><br/><p>He had no interest in becoming a part of such matters.</p><br/><p>All he wanted to do was survive\u2014to make it out of this blood catastrophe alive. He was just like everyone else, desperately grasping at straws to prevent himself from drowning.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui was a little distracted. How would the other party reply? Is the blood catastrophe really man-made? Why? Why would anyone do such a thing?</p><br/><p>He patiently waited for an answer.</p><br/><p>The reply took a bit longer this time.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui came back to his senses as the leaf began to glow again.</p><br/><p>Had fate finally revealed its hand?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

However, Mistress had said that she needed to prepare for a few days and that she still lacked certain items. At the same time, Master was putting on a mysterious front\u2014it appeared that the training this time around would be quite special. However, as compared to his prideful Master and temperamental Mistress, the training made Ai Hui felt more at ease.</p><br/><p>How could he think of such things? How could he not have confidence in his master?</p><br/><p>When Ai Hui realized that he was having such thoughts, he felt ashamed and guilty. He reflected upon himself for a long time. Why was he thinking like that?</p><br/><p>For the next few days, Ai Hui attended classes as per usual since he could not train. He was filled with enthusiasm towards all his classes. The only regret he had was that he wasn\u2019t able to encounter his fellow classmate Bangwan and claim the compensation for the damages the latter had caused.</p><br/><p>After the lessons had ended, Ai Hui returned to the training hall. Lou Lan, who had been anxiously waiting for Ai Hui, scurried over.</p><br/><p>It just so happened that Ai Hui had wanted to find out the current status of his body. With Lou Lan, who specialized in healing, by his side, Ai Hui did not have to worry about any accidents happening.</p><br/><p>\u201cThree and a half minutes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui, who was laying on the ground, felt rather happy. He had lasted a whole half minute longer than what Master had anticipated. To other people, an additional thirty seconds would be equivalent to an extra few breaths of air; however, to Ai Hui, the additional thirty seconds would allow him to execute quite a few attacks.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour attacks are rather powerful,\u201d Lou Lan analyzed, as the yellow light in his eyes flickered. \u201cYour normal attacks have roughly reached the level of two palaces. Your [Arching Fish Back] is your most powerful attack. With a conservative estimate, it has a killing power of three palaces. I do not have enough information and could not make an accurate comparison. Your body is outstanding, and this can provide a significant boost to your fighting capabilities.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lou Lan\u2019s assessment was very accurate\u2014almost identical to Ai Hui\u2019s own assessment of himself.</p><br/><p>During the three and a half minutes, although Ai Hui\u2019s base level was around two palaces, his fighting strength exceeded that level. Other than his remarkable fighting techniques and experience, his excellent body also played a major role in improving his fighting capabilities.</p><br/><p>The high-level elemental energy allowed him to successfully develop the [Copper Skin].</p><br/><p>[Copper Skin] contributed an important upgrade to his body.</p><br/><p>His strength and reaction time had also increased onefold, and his body had become much tougher. Non-refined sword reeds would not be able to inflict any cuts on his skin.</p><br/><p>This meant that even if he didn\u2019t have elemental energy, his base power was at the level of two palaces.</p><br/><p>Developing a tempered body was a difficult process; however, if one were to succeed, it would provide a comprehensive boost to their fighting capabilities.</p><br/><p>Similarly, the power of [Arching Fish Back] had exhilarated Ai Hui.</p><br/><p>[Arching Fish Back] was an escaping technique and was usually used to escape from body locks; it was incapable of inflicting any damage. Ai Hui had ingeniously used it during battles and had discovered that it was a rather good technique to be used during fighting. He then subsequently mastered this technique to the point of perfection during his training in the Suspending Golden Pagoda.</p><br/><p>Other than Ai Hui, no one would waste so much time on an escaping technique that had limited uses.</p><br/><p>This could, however, be linked to Ai Hui\u2019s past experiences. He was extremely meticulous and sensitive to every detail that was related to fighting. He could accurately sense the increase in his powers.</p><br/><p>If it were in the past, he would have to find loopholes in his opponent's defense before executing the [Arching Fish Back]. However, now, if an opponent tried to block his [Arching Fish Back] head-on, they would indeed suffer.</p><br/><p>The densely packed wood shavings that were deeply embedded into the wall of his Master\u2019s courtyard was the best display of his [Arching Fish Back]\u2019s might.</p><br/><p>Combat was very complicated; however, strength was still what mattered the most. When a person who had a base level of four palaces fought against another who had a base level of two palaces, the former might not necessarily win, yet the probability of them winning would definitely be higher. The stronger one was, the more trump cards they had. This would ensure that they would obtain an advantageous position in combat.</p><br/><p>Right now, if Ai Hui were to fight against any student in the Induction Ground, he would win easily as he had rich fighting experience. However, when he would step out of the Induction Ground and enter the Wilderness in the future, it might not be the same case. That was a place where everyone knew how to fight and those who did not would be eliminated.</p><br/><p>Strength was everything.</p><br/><p>And only strength could bring a sense of security to Ai Hui.</p><br/><p>\u201cLou Lan, I can\u2019t move,\u201d Ai Hui groaned, as he lay on the floor.</p><br/><p>Although the three and a half minutes were exhilarating, the strain it put on Ai Hui\u2019s body had far exceeded what he had expected. Currently, his body was sore and aching, and his fighting capabilities were totally crippled. His muscles were involuntarily trembling as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cLou Lan is coming!\u201d</p><br/><p>With a loud cheer, Lou Lan transformed into a massive hammer of sand.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang! Bang! Bang!\u201d</p><br/><p>The huge sand hammer struck Ai Hui\u2019s body. Ai Hui felt so comfortable that he was grasping for cold air while moaning, \u201cAh! Ah! Correct, correct, you\u2019re right on the spot! Harder, please!\u201d</p><br/><p>After enjoying for quite awhile, Ai Hui felt that it was enough, and he yelled, \u201cLou Lan, change to another form!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lou Lan yelled happily as he transformed into two huge sand palms and began to massage Ai Hui\u2019s body as if he was kneading dough.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s the right amount of force! There\u2019s the right amount of pressure! Everything is the right amount\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui felt that his body was as soft as a dough, not belonging to him anymore.</p><br/><p>After a while, Lou Lan transformed into numerous little sand wheels that rolled around Ai Hui\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha, ahh\u2026Lou Lan, you really know a thing or two about massage\u2026Hahaha, it\u2019s ticklish...\u201d</p><br/><p>With a bang, Lou Lan transformed back to his original form. When he saw that Ai Hui had fallen asleep, he pulled him to the hot spring at the back of the courtyard and tossed him inside.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui woke up with a start. At that moment, his pupils dilated as he scanned his surroundings, and he finally heaved a sigh of relief only after he noticed Lou Lan.</p><br/><p>\u201cI actually fell asleep\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui felt somewhat embarrassed. Lou Lan had put in so much effort to massage him, and he had fallen asleep instead. Good job!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Ai Hui,\u201d Lou Lan replied casually. Then, he asked, \u201cAi Hui, what shall we do next?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNext up\u2026\u201d Ai Hui had wanted to suggest taking a nap, but when he saw Lou Lan staring anticipatively at him, he changed his mind. \u201cIs there any news from the young lady of the noodle house?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Lou Lan shook his head.</p><br/><p>When Ai Hui felt that his strength was recovering rapidly, his spirits were raised. \u201cWe shall go to the training hall now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui wanted to fulfill his promise to the lady at the noodle house despite the fact that he did not carry much hope of successfully finding that person.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, Ai Hui!\u201d Lou Lan replied enthusiastically.</p><br/><p>A smile appeared on Ai Hui\u2019s face when he saw Lou Lan\u2019s happy reaction. Lou Lan reminded him of Fatty; however, in this case, Lou Lan\u2019s character was far better.</p><br/><p>Such a nice sand puppet!</p><br/><p>Fatty, that bum\u2014he did not even know how to massage.</p><br/><p>The hot spring was able to help him regain his strength quickly, and after a while, he had regained most of his strength.</p><br/><p>In summary, he could only fight for three and a half minutes\u2014that was his limit. After the time was up, he would lose all means to defend himself. Hence, it seemed reasonable for his master to set three minutes as a time limit for him. It was much easier to recover from exhaustion that was derived from the revolution of elemental energy.</p><br/><p>\u201cLou Lan, is there anything that can regain my strength after what happened just now?\u201d Ai Hui suddenly asked.</p><br/><p>Lou Lan slanted his head for a moment before nodding his head. \u201cYes, you can drink the Energy Replenishing Soup.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there anything that can be carried along with me?\u201d Ai Hui carried on.</p><br/><p>Lou Lan nodded again. \u201cI can make biscuits.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre they expensive?\u201d Ai Hui asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not expensive.\u201d Lou Lan shook his head, as he continued, \u201cAny ingredient that\u2019s related to elemental energy will be costly. Any ingredient that\u2019s related to just energy will be cheap. A lot of biscuits can be made with just fifty thousand yuan. However, you will know how well they work only after you eat them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can come up with the money. Lou Lan, please help me make the biscuits.\u201d Ai Hui clenched his teeth.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem, Ai Hui.\u201d Lou Lan felt very pleased that he could help Ai Hui again.</p><br/><p>When Ai Hui felt that his strength had recovered, he yelled with vigor, \u201cLet\u2019s go! To the training hall!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

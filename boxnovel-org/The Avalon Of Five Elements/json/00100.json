If he could have killed him, he would have already taken action. If he could not kill him, then there was no point in beating him up. Hence, he restrained himself.</p><br/><p>In the Wilderness, telling someone, \u201cSince you saved me, I owe you a favor\u201d would result only in impending death. No one knew if you would live to see the next day. By saying \u201cI owe you a favor,\u201d not only would nobody rescue you in the future, you could also be killed that very night. In such an environment, a favor was very much worthless.</p><br/><p>Trying to reap more than you sow?</p><br/><p>What an ingrate!</p><br/><p>Ai Hui\u2019s impression of Duanmu Huanghun was already set in stone. Without batting an eyelid, he continued, \u201cIs a favor worth fifty million yuan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d Duanmu Huanghun said with pride shining on his face, \u201cHow could you compare my favor to a mere fifty million?\u201d</p><br/><p>Indeed, he had the background to prove his worth. As the future heir of the Duanmu family and his discipleship to Dai Gang, it was not excessive of him to say that his favor was worth more than fifty million yuan.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui restrained himself from murdering the boy, but his patience was wearing thin. \u201cAll right, I don\u2019t need anything else, just two favors. When combined, that totals one hundred million yuan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Now Duanmu Huanghun had been rendered speechless. How could he have calculated it like this? Didn\u2019t he realize the potential usefulness of his favors? Didn\u2019t he want to be a part of the Thirteen Divisions in the future?</p><br/><p>Fifty million yuan? Was this chap insulting him on purpose? How could his favor only be worth fifty million yuan?</p><br/><p>No matter how stupid he was, shouldn\u2019t he at least think before speaking?</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun regarded Ai Hui with a look of despise, his gaze increasingly hateful. This chap was such a lowborn. It was already repulsive that Ai Hui was vulgar enough to desire compensation for a good deed.</p><br/><p>An indescribable rage rose up from within Duanmu Huanghun. He felt as though a precious item he had gifted to a recipient had just been thrown to the dogs without a second thought. And he actually had the gall to ask the dog if he would like to eat such a good item.</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun\u2019s face paled, his gaze practically shooting flames.</p><br/><p>But instead of cowering, Ai Hui only laughed. \u201cLet\u2019s stop with the brainless crap. Do you have one hundred million yuan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at him, Duanmu Huanghun\u2019s anger intensified. He almost blurted out a \u201cyes,\u201d but at the last moment, a thought occurred to him and his expression changed.</p><br/><p>Since young, he had lived a life of luxury, never lacking in money. His family invested heavily in his daily needs such as food, housing and training. Whatever he needed, his family bought for him without a second thought.</p><br/><p>In terms of cash, however, he did not have much on hand, and neither would his family be willing to give him such a large amount like one hundred million as allowance.</p><br/><p>Even if he wanted to, he was clueless on how to approach such a topic.</p><br/><p>Borrow from a friend? He shook his head inwardly. If he didn\u2019t have such a hefty allowance, then neither would his friends. Furthermore, he knew them well; unlike him, who obsessed over training with no desire to chase after an extravagant lifestyle, they indulged in life\u2019s pleasures by overspending with no savings left over. He would rather rely on himself to come up with the one hundred million yuan.</p><br/><p>Seeing the change in Duanmu Huanghun\u2019s expression, Ai Hui felt that this guy was despicable. He continued, \u201cYou don\u2019t have it, right? You\u2019re really good at blowing your own trumpet, but it\u2019s only empty talk. My judgment of you was correct. It\u2019s all right, I\u2019ll just take it as if I had rescued a dog.\u201d</p><br/><p>In Ai Hui\u2019s mind, Duanmu Huanghun had been labeled as a hypocrite and an ingrate.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui could not be bothered with him and swagged off without a second thought. He was a person who clearly distinguished between love and hate. If he felt that Duanmu Huanghun was not worth it, speaking more than a sentence to him was a waste of his time; and time was precious.</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun\u2019s expression alternated between green and red. He bit down on his lips viciously.</p><br/><p>Insulting, extremely insulting! Since young, he had never felt so insulted. Yet, he could not utter a single word of rebuttal. If the other party desired jewels or heirlooms, he would\u2019ve been able to think of ways to procure them. But Ai Hui wanted cash, his achilles heel.</p><br/><p>What a humiliation. The humiliation was indescribable. His porcelain skin flushed red as if it was burning up.</p><br/><p>He clenched his fists until his bones crackled, and his gaze was shadowed.</p><br/><p>All right, he\u2019d been too optimistic. How could a lowly chap like Ai Hui be worthy of his favors?</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t it just one hundred million yuan? Just you wait!</p><br/><p>\u201cTo a useless person like you,\u201d he thought, \u201cearning money is a difficult thing. But pretty soon, you\u2019ll come to see that earning one hundred million is an insignificant matter for a genius like me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Making up his mind, Duanmu Huanghun swore to himself that he would earn more money in the next few days. He would earn one hundred million yuan\u2014No! One hundred million yuan was still not enough to match his worth.</p><br/><p>Two hundred million! No, five hundred million!</p><br/><p>He was going to bring five hundred million in cash and throw it into the chap\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>His mind conjured up an image of Ai Hui, with a fawning face, kneeling like a dog next to a mountain of cash.</p><br/><p>Abruptly, a bewitching, red flush emerged on his face. He felt his body surge with energy. That\u2019s right! This was the feeling!</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha ha ha\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun howled with laughter.</p><br/><p>As Ai Hui entered the training hall, he spotted Lou Lan. The dark clouds in his heart momentarily cleared. To hell with the hypocritical ingrate. He had Lou Lan, a good sand puppet.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a howl of maniacal laughter erupted from the direction of the alley entrance.</p><br/><p>Lou Lan tilted his head and listened. The yellow light flashed in his eyes and after a moment, he said, \u201cAi Hui, this person\u2019s laughter is not very healthy. It is resounding, empty, and lacking in vital energy. There seems to be an unhealthy internal heat attacking his heart as well. He might faint. Eh, the laughter seems familiar? Where could Lou Lan have heard it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Plop.</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun, who stood at the mouth of the alley, stiffened before falling face-down with a strange flush on his face.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui snorted and said, \u201cWho cares about him? It\u2019s best that he fainted. Saves me the hassle of beating him up\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before completing his sentence, he could no longer see any trace of Lou Lan.</p><br/><p>Where did he go?</p><br/><p>Ai Hui looked around, then stared blankly when he saw Lou Lan standing at the entrance with Duanmu Huanghun slung over his back.</p><br/><p>\u201cAi Hui, it is Student Bangwan. Luckily, Lou Lan went down to take a look,\u201d Lou Lan happily said.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui was on the verge of saying, \u201cTrash like Duanmu Huanghun should be fed to the dogs.\u201d</p><br/><p>But seeing the passionate Lou Lan, he could not bring himself to say such words. He internally sighed, thinking, \u201cMy Lou Lan is good at everything, just that he\u2019s too helpful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui did not wish to change this trait of Lou Lan\u2019s. In fact, he was delighted with this particular characteristic. To him, it differentiated Lou Lan from the other sand puppets who were relentless in executing their masters\u2019 orders but indifferent towards matters unrelated to them.</p><br/><p>Lou Lan was different, filled with curiosity and a burning passion for this world.</p><br/><p>Lou Lan should remain as he was, yet Ai Hui\u2019s downcast eyes were as dark as the night sky.</p><br/><p>But why did it have to be this ingrate? Looking at the unconscious Duanmu Huanghun, Ai Hui felt resentful yet conflicted.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

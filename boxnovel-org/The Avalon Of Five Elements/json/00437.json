Kang Ding\u2019s desire to identify the beast bone now was quickly shattered because of the visitors that came knocking one after another, disallowing him to continue his study.</p><br/><p>A few minutes later the shop was filled with people. Kang Ding scanned the room and noticed that some of the enterprises which he hadn\u2019t notified were here as well. They\u2019d probably heard the news since these fellows were well-informed.</p><br/><p>Those who came weren\u2019t of low ranks. They were, at the very least, major persons in charge and they\u2019d all brought along appraisers from respective enterprises. Each in charge had a solemn expression on their faces. The A-grade liquid was worth getting involved in.</p><br/><p>During an era where there was a fire liquid deficiency, there was never an over-emphasis on the significance of an A-grade fire liquid.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t any more space in the shop, but visitors came in an unending stream. Kang Ding felt a headache upon realizing that he\u2019d underestimated people\u2019s interest in the high grade fire liquid.</p><br/><p>Without any better options he said, \"There\u2019s a bigger room outside, let\u2019s go there.\"</p><br/><p>He did not wish to offend any enterprise, big or small.</p><br/><p>There had been more than one enterprise that came to look for him, seeking first-hand, exclusive news and that were willing to offer a bountiful reward.</p><br/><p>Kang Ding rejected them since he was very clear about his own position. Once he branded himself as an associate of a certain enterprise, it was going to be difficult to gain trust from others. The entrusters would also lose confidence as well thinking that he was servicing a certain enterprise, and lacked fairness.</p><br/><p>As such, whenever he had something good, Clearwater City\u2019s main enterprises would be informed so he had decent relationships with respective enterprises. None of them were willing to offend him, in fear of losing their rights to acquire news.</p><br/><p>The big room outside the shop was originally a warehouse, but was modified into a place to receive his entrusters. It was very spacious inside, but the crowd filled it up nevertheless.</p><br/><p>There was no noise as respective witnesses were all looking on in all seriousness. Those accompanying were even more cautious. The atmosphere within the room was grave and solemn.</p><br/><p>Kang Ding stood on the stage. Knowing what those below were thinking, he kept himself from being superfluous, and instead took the colorglass bamboo out directly. There was still about a quarter of fire liquid left in it.</p><br/><p>\"This is a new kind of fire liquid. Till now, I\u2019ve not seen anything similar in any records. It\u2019s very clear, like water, and looking at it from outside the bottle, it\u2019s difficult to imagine that it\u2019s actually a kind of fire liquid. It\u2019s made from lava.\"</p><br/><p>The crowd stirred. The liquid in the bottle was as clear as water, so it was difficult for them to associate it with sticky, red lava.</p><br/><p>\"It\u2019s not clear how this type of fire liquid is being refined, but what\u2019s certain is that it\u2019s been through repeated refinements. We have no concrete information, but I predict it to have gone through over ten refinements before reaching such a clear and transparent state.\"</p><br/><p>Admiration and confidence was present in Kang Ding\u2019s tone.</p><br/><p>\"Being able to be classified as A-grade, this fire liquid\u2019s most unique feature is its pureness and highly perfected state. It has no impurities at all, hence its transparency. At the same time, the fire elemental energy it contains is of an extremely high grade, which is why I believe it\u2019s been through multiple refinements. If it serves as a fire liquid, it can practically blend in with any other fire liquids. In other words, a few drops of it is enough to raise the grade of a fire elementalists\u2019 ordinary fire liquids.\"</p><br/><p>The crowd stirred even more now. They were all proficient business people and understood what this meant.</p><br/><p>It meant that more people could utilize this kind of fire liquid.</p><br/><p>The rich could use all their fire liquid on this type of new fire liquid, whereas poorer fire elementalists could also purchase a few drops to upgrade their own fire liquid.</p><br/><p>Before finishing his explanation he threw an even heavier surprise toward the audience below. \"If it doesn\u2019t serve as fire liquid, fire elementalists of Master level and above can consume it directly to quickly replenish their fire elemental energy. There\u2019s no side effect.\"</p><br/><p>Boom! The crowd below dispersed in an instant.</p><br/><p>Each face was filled with agitation. They\u2019d already seen a golden light path from earlier and now they saw an even more dazzling and luxurious path.</p><br/><p>It might be difficult to pick out the richest people, but masters were definitely the richest bunch.</p><br/><p>They were all of high statuses and countless people were willing to pay them huge sums in exchange for protection. Money to them was just a number. And wasn\u2019t this type of fire liquid, with its ability to immediately replenish their fire elemental energy, considered a life-saving item? When it came to guarding their lives, cost wasn\u2019t an issue at all.</p><br/><p>And with this, what an enterprise could acquire wasn\u2019t just money, but also a master\u2019s friendship.</p><br/><p>A Master\u2019s friendship was much more important than money.</p><br/><p>Before the city expansion announcement, society had been stable and orderly. Under Elders Guild\u2019s suppression, being a Master wasn\u2019t a great deal. Which family did not have at least a few Masters under their roofs?</p><br/><p>In the Wilderness, however, whatever order there was collapsed and Elders Guild had no time to oversee things as well as before. Powerful Masters then became the real despots.</p><br/><p>Luckily, Masters weren\u2019t as powerful as Grandmasters, who were able to laugh at the world beneath their feet and disregard the huge number of elementalists.</p><br/><p>But a Master did gain more privileges. Their words carried more weight. No city chief would carelessly dismiss a master\u2019s opinions. It was ten times more expensive to engage a Master now.</p><br/><p>This was the new era.</p><br/><p>In this context, a Master\u2019s requirements instantly became top priority. This was no different from the situation in Jadeite Forest, save for the fact that the strongest player in Jadeite Forest was Dai Gang, a Grandmaster, and his needs were always the most important needs.</p><br/><p>Upon hearing that this type of fire liquid could be consumed directly by Masters, everyone had trouble restraining themselves.</p><br/><p>Amid their excitement, they felt rather curious as well. If it was a rare and special treasure they could simply attribute its existence to luck. However, this magical fire liquid had been refined, so who was the refiner?</p><br/><p>Who could produce such a high grade fire liquid?</p><br/><p>Such a high grade fire liquid would most definitely be produced in low quantities. How many drops were there?</p><br/><p>Doubts filled their hearts and at the same time, they were thinking about how to win this intense competition.</p><br/><p>Their heads were aching, but soon there was no time for that.</p><br/><p>Kang Ding looked at the record chart in his hand, saying, \"The entruster lives in Cotton Tree Tavern. Mister Ai.\"</p><br/><p>The moment he finished his sentence, sounds of chairs crashing down were heard as some anxious people were already rushing forward.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui did not know that Cotton Tree Tavern was already packed. His gang was still strolling leisurely. That brief episode at the market had been long forgotten.</p><br/><p>The market was a place to get a hold of goods, but they needed them in large quantities, which only enterprises supplied. Most importantly, they had no money. They had to sell off some goods.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui and gang had sold their fire sacks. The market value of scarletfire flying foxes\u2019 fire sacks was stable and each was sold at about a hundred essence elemental beans.</p><br/><p>The main use of fire sacks was to refine fire pouches.</p><br/><p>Fire sacks weren\u2019t as big as fire vats. They were more portable, but weren\u2019t able to store sufficient fire liquid. Since there was a lack of fire elemental materials, the forty sacks on Ai Hui\u2019s hands were quickly sold off.</p><br/><p>Four thousand essence elemental beans gave Ai Hui and gang their first income.</p><br/><p>It would\u2019ve been a generous amount if it had been one elementalist to possess all of it. But for it to belong to a whole city, it was merely a cup of water on a burning cart of firewood.</p><br/><p>Flaming bones were priced much lower than the fire sacks. One piece was worth only twenty elemental energy beans. Mind you, elemental energy beans and not essence elemental beans!</p><br/><p>The exchange rate between essence elemental beans and elemental energy beans changed daily. An essence elemental bean could be converted into three hundred elemental energy beans today. The conversion rate was significantly lower than before since elemental energy beans were more valuable these days. This also highlighted the fact that the Wilderness needed more lower grade elemental energy beans than higher grade and purer ones.</p><br/><p>The market price of flaming bones meant that the pile of bones they\u2019d brought weren\u2019t even worth forty fire sacks.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui\u2019s intestines were turning green from regret. If he\u2019d known that fire sacks were this valuable, he would\u2019ve treated the flying foxes with more care. When facing the bats, he\u2019d completely forgotten how difficult a situation they were being put in.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui was a little anxious. Where were they going to get the money?</p><br/><p>He felt a different kind of pressure.</p><br/><p>In the past, he was only responsible for himself and, at most, Lou Lan and Fatty. Now, hundreds of people and a whole valley were involved, so the pressure was definitely different. If they did not earn enough money and weren\u2019t able to replenish their goods, all work would held back. There wouldn\u2019t be elemental food to provide and trainings would be affected.</p><br/><p>Being a leader wasn\u2019t easy!</p><br/><p>Seeing Ai Hui\u2019s frowning face, Shi Xueman couldn\u2019t help but ask, \"Should I ask my family for assistance?\"</p><br/><p>Shi family had valuable inside information so providing some funding wasn\u2019t a big problem.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui shook his head. \"We\u2019ll continue to think of solutions, the appraisal result isn\u2019t out yet. It\u2019s not that simple to borrow money from your family. It doesn\u2019t matter if we owe you money but owing your family money would be troublesome.\"</p><br/><p>Shi Xueman kept quiet. He was right.</p><br/><p>Father would be glad to support her when it came to her own affair, but things became inconvenient when her family was involved. The money belonged to the family, so many pairs of hands would reach out for payment if they were to borrow money from the family. She wasn\u2019t in favor of using her family\u2019s money as well, unless there was absolutely no choice.</p><br/><p>Wait a minute. It didn\u2019t matter if the money belonged to her? Was he not planning to return that eighty million yuan?</p><br/><p>Shi Xueman glared at Ai Hui.</p><br/><p>Lou Lan spoke loudly and confidently, \"Ai Hui will think of something!\"</p><br/><p>At that, Ai Hui\u2019s worries were forgotten. He raised his brows, laughing, \"You have foresight, Lou Lan!\"</p><br/><p>Shi Xueman, who was staring at him just a moment ago, couldn\u2019t help but smile too.</p><br/><p>The tavern wasn\u2019t far off from the alley.</p><br/><p>At the entrance of the alley Ai Hui stopped.</p><br/><p>There was a huge crowd in front blocking the whole path. Many pulled their collars and waited excitedly, their faces flushed.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui asked uncertainly, \"Have we come to the wrong place?\"</p><br/><p>He remembered very clearly that their tavern was located in a remote spot and its surroundings were rather unfrequented. It wasn\u2019t this lively before.</p><br/><p>Zhao Boan had a suspicious look on his face. He looked around, saying, \"I think it\u2019s here.\"</p><br/><p>Ai Hui looked at Lou Lan. There was no way Lou Lan would get them lost.</p><br/><p>Before Lou Lan could speak, the crowd noticed the gang standing by the entrance. Quickly, all eyes were on them.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui cleared his throat, feeling as if he was being watched by a pack of wolves with rapacious and thirsty eyes.</p><br/><p>\"He\u2019s here!\"</p><br/><p>\"Is that him?\"</p><br/><p>\"Go ask!\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>The crowd stirred and gushed, flood-like, toward Ai Hui and gang.</p><br/><p>What was going on?</p><br/><p>Standing by the alley entrance, Ai Hui was stupefied.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

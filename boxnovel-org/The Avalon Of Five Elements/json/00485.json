Seems like he\u2019s about to break through.\" Shi Xueman announced joyfully.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui genuinely felt happy for Wang Xiaoshan. \"That\u2019s great! He\u2019s been working hard recently.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone nodded in unison. Building a whole city all by oneself was unheard of. The difficulty and workload he\u2019d taken on was astonishing even to laymen.</p><br/><p>Having accomplished such an unimaginable feat, it wasn\u2019t surprising that he was undergoing a breakthrough.</p><br/><p>Le Buleng shot Ai Hui a glance. \"You\u2019re pretty lucky aye, became significantly stronger.\"</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t help but give him two more looks as he was still rather surprised.</p><br/><p>Wang Xiaoshan\u2019s seclusion made him realize the huge potential of Central Pine Faction. Furthermore, these fellows were all so diligent. He had much confidence in the future of this faction.</p><br/><p>But Ai Hui\u2019s progress had him overwhelmed with shock.</p><br/><p>How many days had it been?</p><br/><p>Reasonably, a newly promoted Master would enter a process of steadily ascending improvement. Becoming a Master was like having completed an outline of a piece of art and all that was left was to carve and refine it to perfection.</p><br/><p>A newly promoted Master seldom displayed such a huge increase in abilities.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui was an exception.</p><br/><p>Before, Ai Hui\u2019s energy was extroverted. Now, it was exceptionally well-controlled, except that there was a ring of an aura circling his body, its origin unclear. Was it the sword\u2019s qi? Le Buleng\u2019s eyes glowed slightly, his battlelust stirring endlessly.</p><br/><p>The first master swordsman had just been born and he had yet to spar with her.</p><br/><p>This foreign force made him eager to give it a try.</p><br/><p>He was extremely interested in all kinds of new and unseen forces.</p><br/><p>\"Junior Mu Lei is here to greet Senior!\"</p><br/><p>Mu Lei bowed to Le Buleng respectfully with his waist bent and head lowered.</p><br/><p>Having his thoughts disrupted, Le Buleng pulled a face and asked, \"You are?\"</p><br/><p>For someone whose only goal was to defeat Dai Gang, having an unknown Master stand before him was no different from having an ignorant cow or sheep do the same.</p><br/><p>To slaughter or not to slaughter?</p><br/><p>Mu Lei\u2019s heart jumped, his mouth drying up. \"Fei Yuan is my teacher.\"</p><br/><p>Le Buleng\u2019s expression relaxed a little as a reminiscent look appeared on his face. His tone warmed up instantly. \"You\u2019re a student of Fei Yuan? How\u2019s your teacher doing?\"</p><br/><p>A trace of grief flashed across his eyes. \"He died eight years ago.\"</p><br/><p>Le Buleng sighed. \"He didn\u2019t make it after all. But death is just death. It\u2019s also a delight. He would feel vexed seeing how things have turned out.\"</p><br/><p>Mu Lei knew his teacher\u2019s personality and agreed with Senior Le Buleng. He said in a low voice, \"You\u2019re right.\"</p><br/><p>Le Buleng treated Mu Lei in a friendlier manner, but remained as hostile as ever toward Lu residence\u2019s Uncle Yu. He snorted most of the time and couldn\u2019t be bothered to socialize with him.</p><br/><p>Lu Chen was the first disciple of Dai Gang, so it was only natural for Le Buleng to feel this way. If it had been a decently strong disciple from the Lu residence or Lu Chen in Uncle Yu\u2019s spot, Le Buleng might have even wanted to start trouble with him. But since Uncle Yu was weak, he did not deign to make a move.</p><br/><p>Uncle Yu smiled bitterly. He was knowledgeable and tactful, and knew better than to provoke this old, terrorizing fellow.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui was helpless too. The appearance of this old man made people nervous. He asked quietly, \"How\u2019s Zu Yan?\"</p><br/><p>Shi Xueman nodded her head, saying, \"Not bad. He\u2019s absorbing the fire elemental energy speedily but isn\u2019t awake yet.\"</p><br/><p>In response to the change in topic, Le Buleng waved his hand, adding, \"He\u2019ll wake up once he absorbs sufficient fire elemental energy and becomes a Master.\"</p><br/><p>Ai Hui asked out of curiosity, \"What if he doesn\u2019t?\"</p><br/><p>Le Buleng snorted, \"Then he won\u2019t ever.\"</p><br/><p>Ai Hui clicked his tongue and felt much sympathy for Zu Yan. He also felt that Le Buleng\u2019s answer really fitted his personality. That fellow was so cold and heartless.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui reminded Le Buleng, \"Don\u2019t you need to train, Senior?\"</p><br/><p>Le Buleng glared at him. \"Are you chasing me away, boy?\"</p><br/><p>\"Your time is yours to allocate, Senior.\" Ai Hui continued in all seriousness, \"I believe Mister Dai Gang is feeling very bored right now since he has no opponents.\"</p><br/><p>Despite being aware of Ai Hui\u2019s motive, Le Buleng couldn\u2019t help but let out a groan. \"Bullshit!\"</p><br/><p>Before his words fell, he was already in the air.</p><br/><p>With Le Buleng gone, the atmosphere immediately lightened up. Even Mu Lei let out a breath of relief. He recalled something and retrieved a small wooden case from his sleeves. Handing it over to Ai Hui, he explained, \"This is for Duanmu Huanghun. Sent by his family.\"</p><br/><p>Ai Hui took it and casually passed it to Iron Lady. \"Where\u2019s Bangwan? Why isn\u2019t he around?\"</p><br/><p>Shi Xueman grabbed hold of it and answered, somewhat worriedly, \"He\u2019s in the valley. He\u2019s too anxious.\"</p><br/><p>Ai Hui knew what Duanmu Huanghun was worrying about, but was unable to counsel him since he usually did not listen well to advice to begin with.</p><br/><p>Proud and arrogant, Duanmu Huanghun must be feeling very anxious right now.</p><br/><p>But to become a Master, one mustn\u2019t rush because the more impatient one was, the more easily problems would arise.</p><br/><p>By now, Uncle Yu had already ordered the guards to unload the goods on the beasts. Ai Hui threw the matter to the back of his head and commented excitedly, \"Seems like Senior\u2019s sent some good stuff over.\"</p><br/><p>The guards opened the wooden trunks and a layer of faint light filled the hall immediately.</p><br/><p>Even Uncle Yu\u2019s eyes were wide open in shock. The trunks had been packed personally by Mingxiu, so he wasn\u2019t unaware of the contents. Seeing how each trunk emitted elemental energy waves, he immediately figured that there must be a lot of good stuff inside.</p><br/><p>Mu Lei couldn\u2019t restrain his surprise. He knew how valuable Yuchuan Embroidery was.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t help but feel a lingering fear. If outsiders knew how many Yuchuan Embroideries were in these trunks, someone might\u2019ve taken the risk and looted them out of desperation. Even he himself thought he might be unable to resist the urge.</p><br/><p>The number of Yuchuan Embroideries available on the market was pathetically low. People thought that Yuchuan Embroideries weren\u2019t produced easily and that was why they were so rare. That wasn\u2019t actually the case. The real reason was that Lu Mingxiu couldn\u2019t bear to sell them as she wanted to give them to her junior.</p><br/><p>Lu Mingxiu pampered her junior way too much.</p><br/><p>But just the thought of Han Yuqin and Wang Shouchuan was enough for Mu Lei to feel grief and sigh.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui wasn\u2019t aware of all these things of course. He only felt incomparably touched and cozy.</p><br/><p>The most eye-catching item was an entire set of textiles.</p><br/><p>Mixed with the shining silver silk, the azure wings, made from flowing cloud silk, looked like a reflection created by the sunlight shining onto clear water ripples. It was extremely beautiful and dazzling. The azure wings were joined to a soft, silver armor. There were intricate patterns stacked in layers on top of the wings. Ai Hui saw elemental traces like Rapt Attention, Drawing Element and Wedge-shaped Cloud Armor.</p><br/><p>Rapt Attention allowed him to maintain focus and concentration.</p><br/><p>Drawing Element could help him to draw some elemental energy from metal wind. While the amount it could absorb wasn\u2019t much, he could replenish part of it. This was extremely useful for him when he had to fly long distances.</p><br/><p>Wedge-shaped Cloud Armor was a type of water elemental defensive guard piece, often used on water elemental armors. Shi Xueman had it on hers too.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui\u2019s eyes turned red. He\u2019d thought of Master and Mistress.</p><br/><p>His eyes were on the boots beneath the soft armor and he felt rather surprised. The boots had been woven from scratch and he couldn\u2019t recognize the materials used.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui put them on immediately and they fitted very well. He jumped lightly.</p><br/><p>He almost hit the ceiling. While he was shocked, his eyes quickly lit up. These ordinary looking boots were actually very useful. Ai Hui believed that channeling elemental energy into the boots would increase their effectiveness.</p><br/><p>He suppressed the impulse within him and managed to stop himself from testing it out on the spot.</p><br/><p>This seemingly unremarkable, yet life-saving trick should be kept private.</p><br/><p>Other than the items she\u2019d given Ai Hui, there were a few other quality goods, such as a cloak meant for Shi Xueman, a belt meant for Fatty, a pouch meant for Duanmu Huanghun, a wristband meant for Jiang Wei, an arrow sack meant for Sang Zijun and a hat meant for Wang Xiaoshan. Lou Lan was given the most interesting item. It was an apron with an embroidered image of him holding a ladle in one hand and a wok in the other.</p><br/><p>She\u2019d prepared a gift for every single person that she could remember, so everybody was exceptionally moved.</p><br/><p>Some emotional connections could only be made after going through an experience together.</p><br/><p>Other than these personalised things, the rest of the items were mass produced, yet practical items, such as gloves. There were gloves that could increase strength and gloves that could improve one\u2019s control over elemental energy.</p><br/><p>It was obvious that each item had been prepared with love and utmost care. The wooden elemental ingredients were also things they would need frequently, but were difficult to purchase outside of Jadeite Forest.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui walked past each trunk and looked at each item. Senior did not leave any long messages, but each item had effectively expressed her care and concern.</p><br/><p>He thought about how Mistress had instructed him to protect Senior Mingxiu before she left.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui\u2019s nose started to tingle a little as tears were about to fall down his cheeks.</p><br/><p>\"Ai Hui, Miss mentioned that this item\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The guard spoke while taking out the items on the top. The goods seemed to be pressed at the bottom. Preoccupied with his thoughts and emotions, Ai Hui went over without much thought.</p><br/><p>Uncle Yu saw the redness in Ai Hui\u2019s eyes and felt sad, yet consoled. Those two were like siblings after all.</p><br/><p>Suddenly he heard someone speaking. Wasn\u2019t that guard Zheng Xiao? Could it be that Miss had something to warn him about? No. Zheng Xiao was a guard recommended by the enterprise below and not a guard of the embroidery workshop. If anything, Miss would\u2019ve informed him and not Zheng Xiao.</p><br/><p>Not good!</p><br/><p>Uncle Yu\u2019s face changed. \"Be careful\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Before he could complete his sentence, an unforeseen event took place.</p><br/><p>Gathered before the trunk, Ai Hui heard a soft thud and withdrew quickly.</p><br/><p>The trunk was enveloped by a faint, black smoke.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui shouted, \"Retreat, everybody!\"</p><br/><p>His face started to feel slightly numb. What a potent poison, he thought to himself.</p><br/><p>Lou Lan cried out, \"Ai Hui!\"</p><br/><p>The red glow in his eyes started to flicker. It flashed quicker and quicker, crazier and crazier.</p><br/><p>The others dispersed and surrounded that guard. They looked ferocious and murderous.</p><br/><p>\"Hahaha! It\u2019s useless! You\u2019re dead meat, Ai Hui! It\u2019s Night Moth Fruit! You\u2019re incurable!\"</p><br/><p>Zheng Xiao\u2019s voice became sharp. It was actually a woman.</p><br/><p>Upon hearing those three words \"Night Moth Fruit\", Uncle Yu and Shi Xueman\u2019s faces changed. The rapidly flickering red glow in Lou Lan\u2019s eyes stopped abruptly.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui\u2019s heart sank. He could feel the poison spreading quickly.</p><br/><p>Zheng Xiao unveiled the elemental energy mask on her face and the unfamiliar face of a female was revealed. Only a frenzied madness was present in her face. \"You killed so many of us. The day of redemption is here!\"</p><br/><p>Grass Bandits\u2026</p><br/><p>Uncle Yu recognized the lady and asked in a trembling voice, \"You\u2026 you\u2019re Zheng Xiaoman?\"</p><br/><p>The lady laughed but her face started to stiffen up. It was an eerie sight. She replied, \"Who would\u2019ve thought that Uncle Yu would still be able to recognize me. Hahaha, Lightning Master? So what? Let\u2019s all die together\u2026\"</p><br/><p>With her stiff and raised head she fell over, her breath extinguished.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

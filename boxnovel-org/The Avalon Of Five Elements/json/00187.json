He looked battered and exhausted and his whole body was thoroughly soaked. His face and scalp were covered in sweat and his upper arms were so tired it was as if they were paralyzed.</p><br/><p>Two hours had resulted in two moves. They were all simple strokes, nothing complicated. The combination of the [Minute Arc Stab] and [Hilt Mist] was already considered more complex. There was another inclined move, but the only change lay in its angle. He tried almost all the angles a few times before finally finding the optimal one. He named the combination of [Minute Arc Stab] and [Hilt Mist] as [Misty Strike] and the inclined move as [Oblique Slash].</p><br/><p>The change that had occurred in those two moves were so great that even without the sword embryo\u2019s heartbeat, Ai Hui could still feel their wholesome change.</p><br/><p>The old strokes were now like dance moves, graceful, yet full of power. Sword manuals without spiritual force were like fishes without water. Whether willingly or not, they had long become useless; throwing fishes into the river also led to a dead end.</p><br/><p>A change in the environment meant that a lot of things had to be redone.</p><br/><p>No matter how splendid Ai Hui\u2019s swordsmanship had once been and no matter how many swordplay manuals were left behind, it was difficult for them to fit into this era without some alterations.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui still had not found out the reason behind this. A slight alteration would cause the nature of a sword move to change completely.</p><br/><p>Perhaps there was a resonance between the sword and elemental energy?</p><br/><p>No idea.</p><br/><p>But he knew that he had found the key to solve what the sword techniques lacked.</p><br/><p>There were still many sword moves waiting for him to explore and change. He had ample time to search and understand them, so that was a good start. In the past, he had improvised and used the [Gale Bat Blade] technique, but this time he was going to take it a step further. He had seen countless sword manuals and despite having no idea how to practice them, he knew how the cultivators had done so during the Cultivation Era.</p><br/><p>The [Smoke Meteor] and [Oblique Slash] made him realize that all the sword moves had to be changed starting from the most basic strokes in order to adapt to the elemental energy era.</p><br/><p>This was his greatest reward for the night.</p><br/><p>He never would have thought of this if he hadn\u2019t been struck by a brainwave. There were some sword moves that possessed formidable power even without operating any elemental energy.</p><br/><p>He thought about how he had to come up with a resounding name for this swordplay series when he was done perfecting it.</p><br/><p>For now\u2026 he completely did not feel like touching it!</p><br/><p>He lay on the ground, gazing up at the pitch-black sky.</p><br/><p>Fatty felt himself dreaming a long dream. He dreamt that he was swimming in a boundless lava river. Swimming and swimming for god knows how long, but never escaping the fire sea.</p><br/><p>Muddle-headed, he opened his eyes to find Lou Lan, whose face was almost completely covered by a mask, blocking his view.</p><br/><p>\u201cFatty, you\u2019re really amazing!\u201d Lou Lan exclaimed in admiration, his eyes shining. \u201cThe result was outstanding. Congratulations Fatty, four palaces! Seems like the effectiveness of the dragon soup has something to do with the number of times one consumes it. Yeah, I\u2019ll have to note this down. Please don\u2019t worry, Fatty. I\u2019ll definitely do more research and brew an even better dragon soup!\u201d</p><br/><p>Loss was evident in Fatty\u2019s face. Upon hearing the words \u201cDragon Soup\u201d, he couldn\u2019t help but shiver. He finally remembered what he had been doing before he lost his memory.</p><br/><p>Snapping out of it, he looked at Lou Lan as if he had seen a ghost. He shook his head bluntly and replied furiously, \u201cLou Lan, I\u2019m never drinking your soup again. I still want to live.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Dragon soup isn\u2019t toxic. Although it gets less effective over time, it is still very useful. It can raise your level within a short period of time. You can definitely open up your fifth palace with another bowl,\u201d responded Lou Lan with confidence.</p><br/><p>Another bowl\u2026</p><br/><p>Just thinking about that frightening experience made him tremble again. He would drink a second bowl over his dead body.</p><br/><p>Just then, someone staggered in, their body covered in blood. Seeing who it was, Ai Hui jolted up!</p><br/><p>\u201cManager Li!\u201d</p><br/><p>Manager Li\u2019s body was covered in blood and he was carrying a pouch. Seeing Ai Hui, radiance filled Manager Li\u2019s empty eyes. \u201cBrother\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Having endured until this point, he was already completely exhausted. His legs went soft, causing him to plunge forward.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui suddenly sprang over with a large stride and held onto Manager Li. He then saw that Manager Li was almost eaten clean. Bones were exposed all over his back, making Ai Hui speechless.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese are Bunny Hair Arrows\u2026\u201d Manager Li looked at Ai Hui and smiled, grief and regret evident in his expression. \u201cPardon me, I can\u2019t settle the accounts anymore\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Manager Li opened his eyes wide as his last wisp of spirit dissipated and he stopped breathing altogether.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui held onto him, as motionless as a statue.</p><br/><p>Emerging out of his daze after a while, sorrow was missing from his face. He freed one hand to retrieve the pouch in Manager Li\u2019s arms. There were twenty Bunny Hair Arrows inside. After putting them on the ground, Ai Hui carried Manager Li on his back, turned around, and walked deep into the garden.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui was momentarily brought back to the Wilderness, where he had witnessed comrades around him collapse one after the other. Profound helplessness and despair enveloped him.</p><br/><p>He started digging without a word. He had never helped Fatty out in the past when Fatty had buried their teammates.</p><br/><p>Actually, the relationship he\u2019d had with Manager Li wasn\u2019t very close or anything. They were merely business partners. The Dragonspine Inferno in his hands lifted lumps of earth with each swing.</p><br/><p>So, why was he sad?</p><br/><p>There was nothing to be sad about. Everyone would die someday, and he might even be next; who was going to dig his grave when that time came? Okay, so nothing mattered after death. There was no difference between being buried or eaten by blood fiends.</p><br/><p>By the end of the burial, Ai Hui was back to his normal state of mind. He was used to seeing people leave this world.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Shi Xueman walked over to his side, concern evident in her voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Ai Hui answered with his usual expression.</p><br/><p>Changing the topic, Shi Xueman asked, \u201cYou left the students with me. Isn\u2019t that kind of irresponsible?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do I have to be responsible?\u201d Ai Hui responded.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui\u2019s hoodlum behavior ticked Shi Xueman off. \u201cSo you were just bullshitting the dean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI only agreed to let them follow.\u201d Ai Hui continued matter-of-factly, \u201cIf I have to be responsible, the president has to take more blame.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shi Xueman did not know whether to laugh or cry. She stared into Ai Hui\u2019s eyes, unable to fathom that this scoundrel before her was the same guy that had led them during the battle!</p><br/><p>Okay, to be honest, this guy\u2019s splendid performance over the past few days had confounded the image she\u2019d had of him.</p><br/><p>He\u2019d paid the bill for a female classmate but was so adamant about her returning the money...</p><br/><p>He owed eighty million yuan but had the guts to call people money-losing deal\u2026</p><br/><p>Money! Losing! Deal!</p><br/><p>These three words floated across Shi Xueman\u2019s eyes. Veins on the hand holding Cirrus throbbed as she wanted so badly to stab three holes into his body!</p><br/><p>Impulse was the devil\u2026 this was the real face of this fellow.</p><br/><p>Cooling down, Shi Xueman questioned, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you have no advice for them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy suggestion? Try hard to stay alive.\u201d These superfluous words came out of Ai Hui\u2019s mouth as he kept a serious face.</p><br/><p>Shi Xueman no longer wanted to reason with him. She said simply, \u201cGive Zhijun to me too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as she agrees.\u201d Ai Hui replied indifferently, throwing the bloodstained pouch to Sang Zhijun. \u201cUse them wisely!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sang Zhijun caught it before reassuring him in all seriousness, \u201cI will!\u201d</p><br/><p>Actually, witnessing Manager Li\u2019s death was a big blow to her.</p><br/><p>Shi Xueman walked towards Sang Zhijun without giving Ai Hui a single look. She couldn\u2019t read him sometimes. After calling him a scoundrel, he actually became all generous by gifting Sang Zhijun twenty Bunny Hair Arrows. Shi Xueman had seen how Sang Zhijun bought her Bunny Hair arrows and knew how expensive they were. Sang Zhijun couldn\u2019t even bear to fire them if not for emergency use.</p><br/><p>And he had given her twenty arrows just like that.</p><br/><p>Yet he wouldn\u2019t let one hundred and fifty yuan go\u2026 what a weird fellow.</p><br/><p>Okay, these were not important. What was important was the fact that he dared to call her \u201cmoney-losing deal\u201d!</p><br/><p>Every step that she took carried murderous spirit.</p><br/><p>Initially quite surprised by Ai Hui, the students were utterly shocked by now and their eyes were wide open. They glared at him, clearly infuriated by his careless words from before.</p><br/><p>Towards Shi Xueman\u2019s invitation, Sang Zhijun agreed quickly. She was a smart woman and knew herself well. In order to be of greater value to the team, she had to be put in an auxiliary position.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat an amazing lady!\u201d Fatty, now clear-headed, walked over to Ai Hui\u2019s side and commented in a low voice.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui looked Fatty up and down before saying, \u201cNot bad, four palaces. I have something expensive to give you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing the word \u201cexpensive\u201d, Fatty\u2019s eyes shone. \u201cI knew you wouldn\u2019t forget your own people! What is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui pointed to the half-a-man tall vat in the garden. \u201cThere, a fire vat used specially by fire elementalists.\u201d</p><br/><p>At Ai Hui\u2019s words, Fatty\u2019s face lit up. A fire vat was one of the weapons used commonly by fire elementalists. Usually the vat would be filled with earth-fire lava broth, which not only was helpful for everyday training but was also a highly formidable, powerful weapon in times of battle.</p><br/><p>\u201cFire vat\u2026 is it too early?\u201d Fatty asked, eyes bright as he rubbed his hands, slightly embarrassed. When he finally saw the huge vat in the garden, his face stiffened up. \u201cAi Hui, you meant this vat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty was frightened by the volume of this vat. The Steady Mountain heavy armor on his body coupled with the Ironwood Shield was about sixty pounds, and the big vat before his eyes looked at least two hundred and twenty pounds\u2026 And there was the three-hundred-and-thirty-pound lava broth\u2026</p><br/><p>For a moment, Fatty felt that his life was bleak.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want it?\u201d Ai Hui gave Fatty a look before adding, \u201cJust as well. This fire vat was originally made to be a Heaven-grade weapon, but became a failure because it was too big. I was actually worried that it would affect your speed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that the material used to make it was worthy of a Heaven-grade weapon, his small eyes quickly brightened up. \u201cI want it! Who said I don\u2019t want it! It suits me too well! No one else would have a use for it. It\u2019s no wonder the material seems different\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty\u2019s whole face was almost squashed flat against the outer wall of the fire vat. He was completely enchanted. He got even more excited after seeing the inscription on the vat.</p><br/><p>An elementalist descended from the sky. \u201cWho\u2019s Ai Hui?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am.\u201d Ai Hui stood up.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease get your team ready and assemble at the intersection of Soundwave Street and Brightflower Street at six o\u2019clock. The target of attack and sequence will be arranged for you. Latecomers will be dealt with by martial law.\u201d</p><br/><p>The elementalist ordered expressionlessly, not revealing any emotion. Finishing up, he turned around and left in a hurry</p><br/><p>The atmosphere instantly became grave and stifling.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

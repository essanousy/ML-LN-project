From afar people, were already able to catch sight of the God-subduing Peaks floating in the sky. Four majestic God-subduing Peaks formed a line in the sky, creating a magnificent sight. Light screens lit up and flickered from time to time, contributing to the God-subduing Peaks\u2019 already mysterious vibe.</p><br/><p>\"Those are God-subduing Peaks?\"</p><br/><p>\"How spectacular!\"</p><br/><p>\"Two of those are ours? Oh my, how great!\"</p><br/><p>Members of the Spear of Heavy Cloud exclaimed in admiration. Their eyes shone brightly as a look of infatuation and longing flashed across their faces.</p><br/><p>The God-subduing Peak, a top-notch battle weapon forged by the Elders Guild. It played a huge role in assisting the Wall of North Sea in defending against the Blood of God. So far, God-subduing Peaks were still the most powerful battle weapon in the world.</p><br/><p>The God-subduing Peaks were enormous and bulky, able to station a whole combat division. Each God-subduing Peak was unique because they were made by slicing off mountain peaks at their waists. It was said that the selection of mountain peaks was a stringent process, with the first requirement being that they must be over 1.3 kilometers in height.</p><br/><p>Its defense was extremely shocking. Each God-subduing Peak was basically a fortress in the sky. Its offensive power was equally astonishing. It possessed all five elements and could quickly change its attacking methods.</p><br/><p>The God-subduing Peak gathered the Elders Guild\u2019s most exquisite elemental trace research, the most valuable ingredients, and the top forging methods. Only the Elders Guild had the ability to forge a God-subduing Peak since they were the only ones with an abundance of valuable materials and extremely skillful craftsmen.</p><br/><p>Standing against the God-subduing Peak, the Blood of God had no choice but to attack forcefully.</p><br/><p>When facing an elementalist combat division, a blood elementalist combat division had a relative advantage over them. In a one ono one battle, a blood elementalist combat division had an 80 percent chance of victory.</p><br/><p>However, if the elementalist combat division had a God-subduing Peak, the blood elementalist combat division only had a threefold advantage in terms of military strength, and this was only if they chose to attack head on. Even then, they would have to be prepared to pay a heavy price in exchange for breaking through a God-subduing Peak\u2019s defense.</p><br/><p>To the elementalists, the God-subduing Peak held the most supreme position.</p><br/><p>Even Shi Xueman, who was usually steady and calm, seemed touched. She had been in a God-subduing Peak before and had experienced for herself its immeasurable might. Two God-subduing Peaks were enough to place the Spear of Heavy Cloud onto the list of the most powerful combat divisions.</p><br/><p>Everyone sped up in unison. Even the injured members were excited.</p><br/><p>There were already people waiting outside the camping ground.</p><br/><p>\"Are you Shi Xueman, division leader of the Spear of Heavy Cloud?\"</p><br/><p>The speaker was a middle-aged man, 40 or so with average looks. However, the occasional glints in his eyes convinced people that he wasn\u2019t someone whose abilities should be underestimated.</p><br/><p>Shi Xueman composed herself. \"Yes, I\u2019m Shi Xueman. You are?\"</p><br/><p>The man made his salutations, \"Your humble servant, Zhao Mingwei, is from the Surveillance Division.\"</p><br/><p>The Surveillance Division. Shi Xueman became vigilant and asked calmly, \"I\u2019m here to receive the God-subduing Peaks and some resources. Are there any procedures to follow?\"</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019ve been waiting days for you and thought you weren\u2019t coming.\" Zhao Mingwei smiled. \"There\u2019s no procedure. You\u2019ll just have to enter the camp to verify.\"</p><br/><p>Shi Xueman nodded. \"All right. Where are the two division leaders? Xueman will pay them a formal visit.\"</p><br/><p>In terms of seniority, Wan Shenwei and Ximen Caijue were on par with her father, so she spoke as a junior.</p><br/><p>She walked toward the camping ground as Sang Zhijun and the rest followed behind.</p><br/><p>\"Halt!\" Zhao Mingwei spoke suddenly, \"Sorry, everyone. Only Division Leader Shi is allowed to enter.\"</p><br/><p>The faces of Sang Zhijun and the others changed abruptly. Members of the Spear of Heavy Cloud put on an unfriendly face, and the atmosphere instantly became one of mutual hostility. Everyone was highly guarded against Skyheart City, and now Shi Xueman was going to enter alone. How could they not be worried?</p><br/><p>Shi Xueman stopped them and looked at Zhao Mingwei, saying coldly, \"I\u2019ll be quick, don\u2019t worry.\"</p><br/><p>After that, she entered the camp with her head high.</p><br/><p>Jiang Wei looked murderous at this point. He ordered in a low voice, \"Be on guard everyone.\"</p><br/><p>Members of the Spear of Heavy Cloud took out their weapons silently and got into position. With pagoda cannons in place, they pointed them toward the camping ground. A murderous aura filled the air.</p><br/><p>Thousands of miles away.</p><br/><p>The mirage bean pod light ray flickered.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t any sound in the room since everyone was holding their breaths. They had forgotten how to breathe.</p><br/><p>It was evident that the clip had been recorded some distance away from the battlefield, but because of the ample distance the whole battle could be recorded. The wood elementalist who had recorded the clip was so skillful that even the veteran reporters were left sweating from head to toe.</p><br/><p>The gruesome battle had the audience shaken up and emotionally moved. Blood and flesh splattered everywhere and carelessly right before everyone\u2019s eyes. The Ardent Flower Blood Division\u2019s head on attack made their scalps tingle. Even if it was merely a recording, it was enough to evoke intense reactions from the crowd. The dazzling white flames sprayed by the pagoda cannon ripped through the sky. Trampled by the ardent flower night wolves, the yellow mud on the ground was like a sheet of raised silk, tan in color and carried a devilish luster that flickered nonstop.</p><br/><p>The close quarters fight between Shi Xueman and Xing Shan was on full display.</p><br/><p>Vapor rose from Fatty\u2019s body. He was like an iron tower, domineering and sturdy. A sinister look flashed across his face as he mounted a sneak attack on the enemy division leader.</p><br/><p>Wang Xiaoshan\u2019s transformation of the ground into a muddy marsh was a perfect showcase of a Master\u2019s aura.</p><br/><p>The remarkable blood elementalists\u2019 might and malevolence.</p><br/><p>The bitterness of the short range fights and the hysteria of both parties were clearly demonstrated. They were willing to do anything to continue breathing. The cruel sight of fresh blood mixing in with mud made people feel suffocated.</p><br/><p>Fatty\u2019s breakthrough at the ultimate moment, the terrifying fiery rain, and the strangely inextinguishable white flames made their limbs cold and sent a chill down their spines.</p><br/><p>The Chieftain Wolf\u2019s sacrifice, Xing Shan\u2019s suicidal counterattack\u2026 it was moving and tragic.</p><br/><p>When the final scene ended, the room sank into darkness, and no one said anything for a long time.</p><br/><p>Whoosh. The windows were opened and sunlight entered the room. The bright and beautiful sun couldn\u2019t provide the room with any warmth. Only fear and shock remained on the audience\u2019s faces.</p><br/><p>Prince Gong couldn\u2019t help but exclaim, \"I did not expect the battle to be this gruesome. Shi Xueman\u2019s victory didn\u2019t come easy.\"</p><br/><p>Gong Peiyao pursed her lips. Her face was pale and bloodless. She had been thoroughly frightened and felt extremely regretful. She wouldn\u2019t have watched it if she\u2019d known how gory it would be. She was definitely going to have many sleepless nights. More so than fear, she felt impressed. It was no wonder that Shi Xueman had always been the one looking after her. How much tenacity and perseverance this battle had required! She had felt happy for Sister Xueman upon hearing about the good news, but hadn\u2019t realized how difficult it had been for them to claim this victory!</p><br/><p>Han Li was out of it and shaken up. He had always been responsible for his own sword mastery. Ever since he became a Master, he was convinced that he could go anywhere in this world. Only now did he realize how ignorant he had been. He had been intensely proud of his skills, but how much help would he be when placed on that battlefield?</p><br/><p>On the contrary, being used to such sights, Venerable Volcano wasn\u2019t too affected, but his eyes lit up at that point. \"What an amazing pagoda cannon! What a strange Path of Master! I did not think that a Master could be born out of a pagoda cannon. This thing has great potential.\"</p><br/><p>Prince Gong nodded. \"Recently pagoda cannons have been popular and Shi Xueman seems to be marketing them as best as she can. I had been led to think that the Central Pine Valley was on short of money.\"</p><br/><p>\"War costs a lot.\" Venerable Volcano nodded. \"A combat division\u2019s expenditure is no longer like in the past, when they only had two or three hundred members. It\u2019s normal to be short on money. It would be weird if they were not.\"</p><br/><p>Prince Gong asked directly, \"What do you think about pagoda cannons, Venerable Volcano?\"</p><br/><p>Venerable Volcano answered without hesitating, \"Great prospects! Slightly inconvenient when used single-handedly, but for a combat division they\u2019re perfect. Fire elementalists are cheap nowadays\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Prince Gong interrupted Venerable Volcano with a bitter laughter. \"Venerable, fire elementalists aren\u2019t cheap anymore\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Venerable Volcano was slightly taken aback. \"How come?\"</p><br/><p>Prince Gong laughed even louder. \"Shi Xueman had been demonstrating the power of pagoda cannon on the trip back. She allowed tours and answered all related questions. Pagoda Cannons are in high demand now, and the price of hiring fire elementalists is spiking. Every family has a shortage of fire elementalists.\"</p><br/><p>A look of realization flashed across Venerable Volcano\u2019s face, and he burst into laughter. \"How unexpected, how unexpected. Here I was thinking that fire elementalists were about to fall into decline and look what happened in the blink of an eye. Ai Hui is remarkable, remarkable indeed.\"</p><br/><p>He was a fire elementalist, so naturally it was happy news.</p><br/><p>Prince Gong muttered, \"Looks like we\u2019ll need to polish up the pagoda cannon\u2019s techniques. Engaging fire elementalists isn\u2019t a problem. It doesn\u2019t matter if they\u2019re expensive, so just scout them out. However, we will have to purchase snow lava. Doesn\u2019t that mean we will be in the hands of the Central Pine Valley?\"</p><br/><p>Venerable Volcano had seen a lot, so he suggested, \"Buy some first and we will study it ourselves. If the pagoda cannon is really that popular and snow lava is really essential, would others simply let those people control them?\"</p><br/><p>At that he stopped abruptly.</p><br/><p>Prince Gong\u2019s eyes lit up and were twinkling.</p><br/><p>They exchanged gazes.</p><br/><p>\u2026..</p><br/><p>Fishback City.</p><br/><p>The recording had finally ended, and An Chouchou gave Ai Hui a side glance. A pity his face was wrapped up in bandage, so his expression couldn\u2019t be seen. Ai Hui would probably have an engrossed look on his face right now.</p><br/><p>An Chouchou waved his hand. \"This is my subordinate who just went to purchase this mirage bean pod. If Skyheart City wants to make a move, it would definitely gain support first, and this mirage bean pod is the best way to do it. I had my man be on the lookout, and sure enough, it\u2019s out.\"</p><br/><p>Ai Hui asked faintly, \"What does this show?\"</p><br/><p>An Chouchou laughed out loud. \"Why feign ignorance, Brother Ai? Things have already come to this point, is there any meaning in concealing and hiding?\"</p><br/><p>Ai Hui sighed. \"Looks like Skyheart City is really about to make a move. You\u2019re wise, Brother Chou. What should the Central Pine Valley do?\"</p><br/><p>An Chouchou smiled. \"It\u2019s just a small issue. Surely Brother Ai wouldn\u2019t be defeated by it?\"</p><br/><p>He was full of confidence. It was already set. Skyheart City\u2019s first step was as he had predicted. He believed that this would serve as a message to Ai Hui that the situation was under his control.</p><br/><p>An Chouchou didn\u2019t want to talk too much. Ai Hui was a smart man. With his accumulated experience, Ai Hui could always seek out opportunities.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui\u2019s only chance was to cooperate with Newlight City!</p><br/><p>Only by cooperating with Newlight City could he intimidate Skyheart City and prevent it from making any reckless moves. Other influences, even the Gong residence, wouldn\u2019t be able to do this. Other smaller powers wouldn\u2019t even be able to resist against Skyheart City.</p><br/><p>\"I can\u2019t even earn some money peacefully.\" Ai Hui sounded helpless.</p><br/><p>He stood up, walked toward the door, and left An Chouchou with some parting words, \"It\u2019s late. You should rest early.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

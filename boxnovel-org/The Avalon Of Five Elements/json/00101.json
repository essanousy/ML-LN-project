If looks could kill, Duanmu Huanghun would have died many times over. As Lou Lan skillfully stripped Duanmu Huanghun bare, Ai Hui observed without the slightest intention of helping.</p><br/><p>To him, Duanmu Huanghun looked no different from a blanched suckling pig. This sort of spare ribs would even be scoffed at by a butcher for its utter lack of flesh.</p><br/><p>He cursed relentlessly under his breath.</p><br/><p>If Lou Lan left for even a moment, Ai Hui would have stabbed Duanmu Huanghun multiple times already. He had always despised those who were all talk and no action, yet now he was no different from them. Ai Hui was filled with sorrow; if only he didn\u2019t need that one hundred million!</p><br/><p>\u201cPreparations have been made,\u201d Lou Lan said.</p><br/><p>Roused from his self-pitying stupor by Lou Lan\u2019s words, Ai Hui automatically replied, \u201cAh\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>There he saw Duanmu Huanghun, stripped to his underwear and lying on the table beside Lou Lan. His body was strangely bright red like a cooked prawn.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui looked at Lou Lan oddly. What did he mean by preparations have been made?</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes he mean that I can start beating him up?\u201d he thought. \u201cThen why didn\u2019t he say so earlier? Lou Lan must still be too inexperienced at these things. What I plan on doing is similar to how a butcher slaughters livestock; there\u2019s no need to strip someone bare before killing him. At my current level, I can kill him without spilling a single drop of blood. Afterwards, all we have to do is feed him to the dire beasts, and he\u2019ll have disappeared without a trace. Faking a natural death isn\u2019t impossible either. All we need are the right materials. Have you prepared these materials, Lou Lan\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Ai Hui\u2019s murderous intent reached its highest point, Lou Lan began to explain.</p><br/><p>\u201cBangwan\u2019s current conditions is more serious than the last time. Luckily, Ai Hui\u2019s strength has also improved, so we can still save him. You must be anxious to help since the two of you seem to have a good relationship.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui froze, as if a binding curse had been placed on him. The corner of his eye twitched as he asked, \u201cSave him? Me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Ai Hui\u2019s metal elemental energy can stimulate his body and facilitate the movement of his vital fluids,\u201d Lou Lan said, continuing honestly, \u201cLou Lan\u2019s elemental energy may not be enough to save Bangwan, but rest assured, Ai Hui is definitely capable of saving him.\u201d</p><br/><p>To hell with this!</p><br/><p>I have to save this ingrate again?</p><br/><p>Seething inside, Ai Hui raged internally like a dire beast rampaging through the woods.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you not feeling well?\u201d Lou Lan asked, deeply concerned. Ai Hui wasn\u2019t moving much, and his complexion was abnormal. Lou Lan prepared his eyes for a scan.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui raised his head, revealing an incredibly forced smile.</p><br/><p>Lou Lan heaved a sigh of relief. \u201cAi Hui, the technique is exactly the same as before.\u201d</p><br/><p>Turning to face the unconscious person lying on the table, his eyes flared with hatred as he asked, \u201cI have to use elemental energy for this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Ai Hui.\u201d Lou Lan further explained, \u201cBangwan\u2019s condition is more serious this time around, so Ai Hui must use elemental energy. The force exerted should also be slightly increased.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExert more force?\u201d Ai Hui asked, his lips curving into a grin. \u201cNo problem!\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as he finished his sentence, a crisp slap resounded through the air. A clear imprint of Ai Hui\u2019s palm appeared on Duanmu Huanghun\u2019s bright red body that still trembled from the impact.</p><br/><p>You may have escaped death, but you\u2019ll still have to face my wrath. Blame your bad luck for delivering you right into my hands!</p><br/><p>Using his palms, Ai Hui rapidly delivered blow after blow at full force.</p><br/><p>Enemy, enemy, enemy! Ingrate, ingrate, ingrate!</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun\u2019s body began to swell up like an inflated balloon as Ai Hui continued to rain relentless blows on him.</p><br/><p>This was only his second time unleashing his full strength since the mishap. The first had been during the blind battle at the training ground. Otherwise, extracting silk required him to slow his elemental energy significantly, and his regular trainings were the same as well.</p><br/><p>Being able to fully utilize his strength was deeply satisfying.</p><br/><p>Recalling his method of using a sword technique to extract silk, his fingers readily moved into position, poised to take action.</p><br/><p>The sword technique he previously used had been the result of a sudden inspiration. His subconscious attempt to channel elemental energy into a non-existent sword had yielded surprisingly remarkable effects.</p><br/><p>During silk extraction, Ai Hui could barely feel the movement of his elemental energy due to its incredibly slowed speed. This time, however, his elemental energy was free of constraints and circulated at full power. Ai Hui executed his sword technique and immediately felt the difference.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Without warning, the insanely fast elemental energy within his body became torpid.</p><br/><p>The sword embryo state!</p><br/><p>Ai Hui was taken aback. The sword embryo state that he so painstakingly avoided appeared without warning. And for the first time, he activated it without a sword in hand. There was no mistaking it; he could feel the imposing aura exuding from the exceptionally fine tip of the blade between his brows.</p><br/><p>While Ai Hui didn\u2019t know how to describe the aura, the closest word he could think of was \u201cformidable.\u201d</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>Like being in the sword embryo state.</p><br/><p>The sword embryo state surely had extensive uses, but it was easy to become reliant on it.</p><br/><p>The world in Ai Hui\u2019s vision was now completely different. Duanmu Huanghun\u2019s skin appeared much thinner, clearly revealing his vital fluids\u2019 movements and its chokepoints.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui was deeply familiar with the sword embryo state; he had experienced the vast benefits, as well as the suffering it could bring.</p><br/><p>Despite that, he was shocked to sense the movement of the elemental energy within his body so clearly.</p><br/><p>Ever since his elemental energy had become tightly wound, he could utilize only small amounts of elemental energy with the help of the Sword Rattan Gloves. The purity of this elemental energy, however, far exceeded that of his natal residence. As a result, when circulating at full power, its speed was beyond what Ai Hui could perceive. Only during silk extraction, when the elemental energy was restricted, could he clearly perceive its movement.</p><br/><p>The slow circulation of elemental energy was suitable for training, but fighting required swiftness. If the speed of circulation exceeded the agility of one\u2019s thoughts, however, the elemental energy could easily spiral out of control.</p><br/><p>He knew that the elemental energy wasn\u2019t circulating any slower; it was the sword embryo state that was enhancing his processing speed and perception, allowing him to fully capture the flow of his elemental energy.</p><br/><p>Without hesitation, Ai Hui turned his palm into a blade and stabbed his fingers towards one of the blockages within Duanmu Huanghun\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Buzz!</p><br/><p>Around his fingertips, a faint blade appeared, accompanied by a slight, ringing sound as the blade penetrated Duanmu Huanghun\u2019s flesh.</p><br/><p>The blockage was immediately cleared.</p><br/><p>A demonic glow flashed in his eyes, his fingers rapidly prodding Duanmu Huanghun\u2019s entire body.</p><br/><p>Buzz buzz buzz!</p><br/><p>Piercing sounds rang out incessantly. With each thrust of Ai Hui\u2019s fingers, a tiny speck of blood appeared on Duanmu Huanghun\u2019s body. As they grew in number, the reddish hue of his body began to subside.</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun sluggishly woke up.</p><br/><p>As he stared at the vile face in front of him, his body chilled.</p><br/><p>This situation felt way too familiar.</p><br/><p>He silently closed his eyes. Why was he having this nightmare again? So much time had passed since that incident; surely his mind was stronger than this.</p><br/><p>This nightmare must still be haunting him because he hasn\u2019t gotten over the incident. He probably just needed to exact revenge on that scumbag.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, why are you pretending to be dead? Are you trying to be an exhibitionist?\u201d</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun grew bewildered. This wasn\u2019t part of the script\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake note! Including this time, you now owe me one hundred and fifty million!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Duanmu Huanghun playing dead rekindled Ai Hui\u2019s anger. Unable to restrain himself any longer, Ai Hui viciously smacked Duanmu Huanghun right on the thigh.</p><br/><p>As if struck by lightning, Duanmu Huanghun grew addled from the blow.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

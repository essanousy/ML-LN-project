Although they didn\u2019t like those guys either, never once did they think about attacking them.</p><br/><p>With their family background, it was best not to irritate them.</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun had some knowledge of Ai Hui\u2019s characteristics; he knew Ai Hui would never allow himself to be trampled upon. But what he didn\u2019t expect was that he would choose such a straightforward method.</p><br/><p>What was more surprising was that in a two-versus-six fight, Ai Hui and Fatty ended it so quickly and neatly. Admittedly, it was a sneak attack, but everyone here was nevertheless astounded.</p><br/><p>If he had been the one to be attacked by Ai Hui just now, would he have have been able to escape? The more Duanmu Huanghun thought about it, the more fearful and vigilant he became against Ai Hui\u2014because he knew that if it were him, he would have been hardpressed to survive as well.</p><br/><p>Sang Zhijun was similarly stunned. She glanced at Shi Xueman, remembering the scene where she threw Li Hai out of the transport wagon. She thought to herself that the means of these two were amazingly similar. At the time, she thought Shi Xueman to be violent enough. Now she knew that Ai Hui was more violent. No, it was not violent. It was better described as ferocious.</p><br/><p>The next moment, however, she became a bit worried. These guys were beaten so harshly and would not let him off easily. Did he ever consider the consequences?</p><br/><p>Shi Xueman suddenly spoke up, \u201cDo you think they will obey your command this way?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui was squatted on the ground, tying up the unconscious guys with ropes. He answered without looking up, \u201cObey my command? Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shi Xueman was surprised. \u201cThen what are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t want them to hinder us,\u201d Ai Hui said lightly.</p><br/><p>No one understood why Ai Hui was so cruel if all he wanted was for them to not impede the team.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what are you going to do?\u201d Duanmu Huanghun asked. He knew a bit more about Ai Hui than the others, and he guessed the Ai Hui\u2019s method would be different from their expectations.</p><br/><p>\u201cTie them up tight,\u201d Ai Hui replied casually while tugging at the ropes, \u201cand find somewhere to lock them up. I\u2019ll let them out when we finish.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was startled by this answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cD-do we have to do this?\u201d Wang Xiaoshan stammered.</p><br/><p>They did have their conflicts and disagreed with each other, but was it necessary to lock them up? Ai Hui\u2019s method seemed too extreme.</p><br/><p>Shi Xueman also tried to persuade him. \u201cI think we can talk them into it. I believe they\u2019ll come to see the big picture.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what if they stab us in the back, or refuse to cooperate with us and cause great losses?\u201d Ai Hui continued without slowing down.</p><br/><p>Sang Zhijun quavered, \u201cWill they really do this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tightening the rope, Ai Hui said calmly, \u201cFor many things, there is no second chance. Don\u2019t leave any hidden dangers to yourself. It\u2019ll be for the best, for both of us, if they stay here quietly until we are out of danger.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone shivered. Ai Hui didn\u2019t mention what would happen if they didn\u2019t stay here quietly.</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun\u2019s astonishment turned to admiration. He now understood vaguely why he always lost to Ai Hui; it was because he was not as resolute.</p><br/><p>Of course, if Ai Hui knew what he was thinking, he would disagree.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m not mistaken, I have absolute control, right? Then my first command is to tie them up and lock them in the wood house.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWill the academy or magistrate court take actions against us?\u201d Jiang Wei was a bit worried as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, they\u2019re more than willing for us to do so.\u201d Ai Hui\u2019s tone became cold. \u201cI don\u2019t want to explain anymore. Now you have two choices\u2014to accept or to refuse.\u201d</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, the first to speak was Duanmu Huanghun. He said emotionlessly, \u201cUseless people should stay in the wood house.\u201d</p><br/><p>He wanted to teach them a lesson from the start. In his heart, the first one qualified to question Ai Hui\u2019s command was Shi Xueman, and the second was himself. How dare these guys jump out to oppose Ai Hui while knowing that both he and Shi Xueman had agreed?</p><br/><p>Jiang Wei and Wang Xiaoshan looked at each other before hurrying to do as Ai Hui commanded.</p><br/><p>Sang Zhijun laughed. \u201cActually, we\u2019re glad to do so.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shi Xueman snorted. She felt uncomfortable with Ai Hui\u2019s attitude, but since it was her own proposal\u2026 she had to stick to it.</p><br/><p>She walked towards one of the unconscious figures and picked him up.</p><br/><p>After finding a wood house, they threw the six tightly trussed students into it, going so far as to gag them to prevent them from calling out for help.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow will they eat?\u201d Shi Xueman asked.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui casually said, \u201cThey\u2019ll be able to eat when we come back. Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not so easy to die from starvation. We can just leave them some water.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sang Zhijun reflexively asked, \u201cAnd what if we don\u2019t come back?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai Hui glanced at her, then said lightly, \u201cThat means we are dead.\u201d</p><br/><p>A chill rose in everyone\u2019s hearts, and their gazes at Ai Hui were now filled with fear.</p><br/><p>Only then did they realize how heartless and cruel he was despite their similar ages.</p><br/><p>Shi Xueman was greatly shocked, doubting whether she ever knew the person in front of her. Was this the same person who paid her bill at the noodle house and tried to please her due to the eighty million debt he owed her?</p><br/><p>Just what kind of person was he? What did he go through? Shi Xueman\u2019s curiosity towards him was roused.</p><br/><p>Everyone was quiet, including Duanmu Huanghun. Proud as he was, at this moment, he appeared solemn. The people present felt as though they were a flock of sheep while Ai Hui was a dangerous beast used to the life and killings of the wild.</p><br/><p>Now they were sure that Ai Hui did not care about the retribution of the students or their families. They even suspected that if they were not present, Ai Hui would have already killed the six people quietly.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui noticed the fear in their eyes, but he didn\u2019t care.</p><br/><p>What they were thinking or whether it would lead to their estrangement\u2014he did not care. If not for the escape quota, he would not have wanted any connection with them.</p><br/><p>Walking out of the wood house, he saw that Fatty was still practicing.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have something to tell you in advance.\u201d Ai Hui paused to think for a minute before continuing, \u201cThe situation might be worse than you think.\u201d</p><br/><p>He noted the anxious and doubtful looks on their faces and said firmly, \u201cWorse than whatever you can imagine. We\u2019ll be faced with many dangers more precarious than what we experienced in the Garden of LIfe or even the blood bat. I hope we can leave here alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d asked Wang Xiaoshan, who was the most fearful one of those present. His face was pale.</p><br/><p>As Ai Hui was about to speak, they heard a loud explosion in the distance, and the earth began to quake.</p><br/><p>Duanmu Huanghun\u2019s face paled. \u201cThat was from the city gate!\u201d</p><br/><p>They then saw many elementalists flying to the city gate from all quarters. Despite their high elevation, Ai Hui and the others could read the panic on their faces.</p><br/><p>They began to feel anxious as well.</p><br/><p>But Ai Hui remained calm as before. He noticed Lou Lan and the number that he had transformed into which indicated that Fatty was done with practice. Staggering out with the ironwood shield as his stick, Fatty was soaked with sweat, looking as though he had just climbed out of a pool. His heavy breathing sounded like bellows, and his eyes were wide as he glared at Ai Hui.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cAi Hui, Fatty has finished,\u201d Lou Lan said happily.</p><br/><p>Ai Hui nodded. \u201cGood. It\u2019s time to have some food.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing what Ai Hui said, Fatty\u2019s anger turned into weariness and hunger. He plopped onto the ground and shouted, \u201cOops. I need to eat more. I\u2019m dead tired. Water, Lou Lan, I need water!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lou Lan took out some of the solid food that he had prepared. Ai Hui said, \u201cLet\u2019s all have some.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shi Xueman couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cDon\u2019t we need to help them? If the city gate falls, then we\u2019re all doomed.\u201d</p><br/><p>While eating, Ai Hui said, \u201cThe city gate already has the best defense. If it\u2019s about to fall, then there\u2019s nothing we can do to help.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shi Xueman wanted to retort but realized there was nothing she could say; she knew Ai Hui was right. The mayor had already assigned guards and teachers to key areas for the city\u2019s defense, and the city gate was the topmost priority. Compared to them, the six people here were a drop in the ocean.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, the best choice for us is to stay in the training hall.\u201d Ai Hui glanced at Shi Xueman. He was wondering if he could knock them out if he launched a sneak attack. The dean only wanted Shi Xueman and Duanmu Huanghun to be alive anyway. He would not care whether they were conscious or not.</p><br/><p>But it seemed this plan would be hard to achieve. The fighting skills of Shi Xueman, Duanmu Huanghun, and Sang Zhijun were all upper-tier. If he could not defeat them in one go, he would be beaten down for sure.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo we hide here like cowards and watch them die without doing anything?\u201d Shi Xueman watched Ai Hui coldly. If she could kill Ai Hui with her eyes, then Ai Hui would have died a thousand deaths.</p><br/><p>She began to doubt the wisdom of her suggestion to give Ai Hui the right to lead. He was too sophisticated.</p><br/><p>The others remained mute with frightened expressions, but they did not agree with him either. Only, they did not dare to oppose due to his imposing manner.</p><br/><p>You are all just too naive and enthusiastic, Ai Hui thought to himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Unexpectedly, Ai Hui admitted his mistake at once. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the magistrate office to get some equipment. I\u2019ll collect my reward as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty was speedily stuffing food into his mouth. He seemed without emotion, but inside, his mind was turning rapidly. He knew that there must be something that Ai Hui wasn\u2019t saying!</p><br/><p>He knew Ai Hui too well. If he admitted his mistakes quickly, then either he knew he was wrong, or he did it with a motive in mind.</p><br/><p>The others were eating the food silently.</p><br/><p>Shi Xueman didn\u2019t expect Ai Hui to admit his mistake so quickly. To ease the tension, she praised, \u201cThis tastes pretty good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLou Lan made it. I\u2019m afraid we won\u2019t have time to cook, so I asked Lou Lan to make more. It should be enough to last us several days,\u201d Ai Hui said.</p><br/><p>Lou Lan, who was standing next to Ai Hui, smiled happily, his eyes behind the pale mask becoming like crescent moons.</p><br/><p>Everyone was surprised to find that Lou Lan was able to cook. From his outstanding performance in the fight just now, they assumed Lou Lan to be a combat sand puppet; they didn\u2019t know he would also be good at household skills.</p><br/><p>But Shi Xueman noticed something else and could not help but look at Ai Hui.</p><br/><p>He began to prepare for this long ago?</p><br/><p>He really was a mysterious guy.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Ai Hui suddenly gestured for them to keep quiet.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

His brow furrowed as he answered flippantly, \u201cWatch it on your own.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s useless to think about it since there\u2019s nothing you can do if his teacher doesn\u2019t agree. You\u2019d better not offend the teachers of the Induction Ground,\u201d Zhou Xiaoxi replied from outside. \u201cRecruiting soldiers was never an easy task to begin with, so don\u2019t make things difficult for yourself. It\u2019ll be too late to regret if you end up getting backstabbed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t spout nonsense. Teacher Wang is not like that!\u201d Li Wei quickly retorted. \u201cI\u2019ve attended his lessons before, and I am confident of his character.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn any case, don\u2019t push too hard. You\u2019ve been disadvantaged quite a few times because of such issues already.\u201d Zhou Xiaoxi was still worried as he continued to warn Li Wei. \u201cYou should stop feeling so miserable; your luck is already good enough. Although your potential successor\u2019s teacher refuses to let him go, you just need to gradually wear him down. I, for one, haven\u2019t even seen anyone worthy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Wei asked lazily, \u201cIsn\u2019t it easy for the North Sea Auxiliary Division to recruit members? Do you really need to compete with us bitter folks\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBitter? More like sweet,\u201d Zhou Xiaoxi teased. \u201cSomeone has been distracted ever since he returned that day. I sense some stirrings of love, oh, glorious spring![1]\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Wei immediately jumped out of bed in embarrassment and dashed out of his room, shouting, \u201cToday seems like a good day for us to exchange blows! You can make fun of me, but it\u2019s simply unbearable if you tarnish a fair lady\u2019s reputation like that!\u201d</p><br/><p>Acting all innocent, Zhou Xiaoxi protested, \u201cDid I say something wrong? Tarnished her reputation?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u201d Li Wei was at a loss for words. His embarrassment quickly turned to anger as he taunted, \u201cCome over here right now. I\u2019m gonna beat your North Sea dog face into the ground.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Xiaoxi was not one bit angry. He joked loudly, \u201cI am a North Sea dog, and you are a blooming sago tree[2]\u2014I mean\u2014a blossoming metal man. Alright, alright, I\u2019m only teasing. Such things are part of human nature. Next time, I\u2019ll introduce you to the ladies of the North Sea who are as stunning as the ocean. Do you know why the women of the North Sea are called the daughters of the sea?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Wei was veered off course. \u201cBecause they\u2019re as stunning as the ocean?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Xiaoxi replied innocently, \u201cYes, they\u2019re stunning, but what\u2019s the main feature of the ocean? It\u2019s extremely temperamental! When it\u2019s happy, all is calm and well. If it\u2019s unhappy, prepare to feel the wrath of its storms! Do you know why I\u2019m still single? I am a man who has braved these storms and lived to tell the tale! I heard that the ladies in the Infantry are blessed with good figures?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Wei nodded his head in response to Zhou Xiaoxi\u2019s curiosity. \u201cDefinitely. Every one of them has amazingly well-proportioned figures. They are well-toned and have abs\u2014not even a single one of them has the slightest bit of flab. To top it off, they are most certainly not temperamental.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d Zhou Xiaoxi said, as his eyes lit up with joy. \u201cI leave my future happiness in your hands!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as you can satisfy their three needs, your relationship will be very blissful,\u201d Li Wei said while he casually lifted three fingers.</p><br/><p>\u201cMoney? Not a problem! Looks? I have that as well! My figure is not too shabby either!\u201d Zhou Xiaoxi announced, brimming with confidence.</p><br/><p>Li Wei let out a chuckle. \u201cThe ladies in our Infantry Division do not look out for these things. Their three needs refer to the need for blood when killing, the need to violently vent their anger, and the need to rip things out of sorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Xiaoxi shivered momentarily in fear. He muttered, \u201cI think I\u2019ll just remain single, then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it, let\u2019s move on from this sad topic. Come, let\u2019s watch the movie bean,\u201d Zhou Xiaoxi said, back to his usual self. \u201cYou have no idea how hard it was to buy this. I queued really long for this bestseller.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat movie bean is this?\u201d Li Wei casually asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you heard of Zu Yan? The one who was defeated by an earth elementalist a while back? He\u2019s a pretty arrogant chap, openly distributing his written challenge for all to see. He\u2019s really landed himself in an embarrassing situation this time.\u201d Zhou Xiaoxi was clearly gloating at Zu Yan\u2019s misfortune.</p><br/><p>Between the aristocratic families and the commoners lay an uncrossable chasm. This disparity was apparent everywhere, even on the front line.</p><br/><p>Aristocratic families often had long and illustrious histories, leading all the way back to the battle that had founded the Avalon of Five Elements.</p><br/><p>After the Avalon of Five Elements had gradually stabilized, a protracted period of expansion had begun. Talented individuals from the Old Territory were brought into the Avalon of Five Elements as new residents to fill the space created by the continued expansion.</p><br/><p>Most of the commoners of the Avalon of Five Elements could trace their roots back to the migrants from the Old Territory.</p><br/><p>Despite the declining influence of these families and the rise of several outstanding commoners, the allocation of resources was still vastly skewed in favor of the aristocratic families. They controlled almost eighty percent of high-grade resources.</p><br/><p>Conflicts between the commoners and aristocratic families were everywhere but were especially prevalent on the front line, where such clashes were almost an everyday occurrence.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard of this before,\u201d Li Wei said, nodding. He suddenly felt curious. \u201cHow did he lose so badly if he could execute an absolute art?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019d like to see this ferocious earth elementalist for myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Xiaoxi took out the movie bean, tossing it into the light-swallowing, shadow-spitting nepenthes[3] set on the table. This particular type of bonsai had a broad range of uses and was compatible with many media products made by wood elementalists.</p><br/><p>In the dark brown-colored pot stood a twenty-centimeter tall nepenthes with a large pitcher. The pitcher was decorated with a wood elementalist\u2019s signature, and a red ring encircled its opening.</p><br/><p>After being tossed into the nepenthes, the movie bean was quickly dissolved by digestive fluids. Within moments, a beam of light sprang out of the pitcher\u2019s opening.</p><br/><p>The faint light converged into a rather blurry image.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is it so unclear?\u201d Zhou Xiaoxi said, visibly upset. \u201cUnscrupulous businessmen! How dare they sell such low-quality beans at such exorbitant prices! This is crazy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t expect too much from this small region,\u201d Li Wei said in an understanding manner. He was familiar with how things were like in the area. Watching the projection, he continued, \u201cObserve carefully, or you\u2019ll lose out even more.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing Li Wei\u2019s advice, Zhou Xiaoxi ceased his complaints and watched every detail attentively.</p><br/><p>It was evident that the mirage bean pod was focused on Zu Yan from the get-go; he was simply too eye-catching. His heavy legs were like hatchets, and his attacks were cleanly executed. His moves were not the least bit sloppy.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s pretty powerful,\u201d Zhou Xiaoxi muttered to himself. \u201cThat\u2019s a rather well executed [Hellfire Spider Web].\u201d His condescending manner from before had disappeared.</p><br/><p>He had initially thought that Zu Yan\u2019s defeat was the result of insufficient combat experience. Judging from the footage, however, Zu Yan appeared to be highly seasoned and had not made any mistakes. Besides having a higher base level, Zhou Xiaoxi himself probably couldn\u2019t have done any better.</p><br/><p>Li Wei did not utter a single word; he just stared at the footage.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t a single opponent on the ground who could match Zu Yan. He took down a handful of contestants without breaking a sweat.</p><br/><p>Everything changed when he attacked a participant that had a mask on.</p><br/><p>That seemingly innocuous contestant suddenly made a move, punching Zu Yan\u2019s heavy leg.</p><br/><p>Zhou Xiaoxi subconsciously shook his head. Considering that legs were much more powerful than fists, the most viable options against the heavy leg were to either dodge and find an opening, or to fight fire with fire and return with a kick.</p><br/><p>What happened next gave him a shock. Zu Yan was knocked back a good couple of steps while his opponent only needed two to stabilize himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cImpressive strength,\u201d Li Wei commented objectively.</p><br/><p>\u201cZu Yan seemed a little stirred up\u2014he must have recognized the other party,\u201d Zhou Xiaoxi observed. His vast experience with actual combat allowed him to deduce this fairly quickly.</p><br/><p>However, the sight of the mysterious earth elementalist suddenly changing direction in mid-air as he rushed towards Zu Yan made them both stand up spontaneously in shock.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Don\u2019t rush in! We aren\u2019t lacking nutritional fluids anymore!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Roots grew a bit more! Let\u2019s go to the wreckage!\u201d</p><br/><p>There was chaos everywhere.</p><br/><p>Maybe it was because the Calamity Fish had died but the World Tree was growing at a pace that was visible to the eye and somehow the Nutritional Fluids were more abundant.</p><br/><p>\u2018If the Roots grow at this pace then we might really be able to save billions. But what\u2019s the point. You dumbass. You are the one who needs to survive.\u2019</p><br/><p>It had been days since she had searched around these Roots after the Calamity Fish had died.</p><br/><p>But she could not find that Hansoo guy no matter what.</p><br/><p>And even more since she had to dodge the clansmen of the six pillars.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damnit. I need to know whether you\u2019re alive or not.\u2019</p><br/><p>She had even used her precious wish card that she had been saving just to find that guy.</p><br/><p>At that moment a woman flew down from the air and then landed next to Camille.</p><br/><p>Kwaaaaa!</p><br/><p>A vibration that rang throughout the ground resonated.</p><br/><p>But Camille made an extremely welcoming expression, looked at the woman who landed, Sof\u00eda, and then asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt took you a while. Did you find him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sof\u00eda shook her head at those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cI searched all around here according to your wishes but he\u2019s not here. He doesn\u2019t even get caught in my trait either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Camille clenched her teeth as she looked at Sof\u00eda.</p><br/><p>\u2018If Sof\u00eda can\u2019t find him then I really can\u2019t find him\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Trait, .</p><br/><p>It gave information about the things one didn\u2019t know and also gave simple information as to what to do.</p><br/><p>A trait that really stood out in this world where information became strength and power.</p><br/><p>Sof\u00eda also made a fed up expression as she spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a first for me too\u2026 Usually there\u2019s only two different scenarios where they don\u2019t show up when I want to find them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Camille clenched her teeth at those words.</p><br/><p>Since she knew about it somewhat.</p><br/><p>If Sof\u00eda thinks of something she wanted than a location or a direction will show up.</p><br/><p>But there were only 2 cases where it won\u2019t come out.</p><br/><p>A location where it was too dangerous for Sof\u00eda.</p><br/><p>Or nonexistence.</p><br/><p>\u2018Did he really\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>But sadly there wasn\u2019t any places in the Red Zone where Sof\u00eda\u2019s strength was not enough.</p><br/><p>Since Sof\u00eda was a strong person who was above the standards.</p><br/><p>Which means the likelihood of the second case was high.</p><br/><p>While Camille was making a worried expression, Sof\u00eda\u2019s eyes suddenly brightened up.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? The location comes up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy does it suddenly come out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sof\u00eda made a confused expression.</p><br/><p>Since she was able to find Hansoo\u2019s location that Camille had asked for suddenly.</p><br/><p>Anyways, she would be able to find him now.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHu-uk!\u201d</p><br/><p>Camille was shocked at Sof\u00eda who had aggressively hugged her but she couldn\u2019t even retaliate.</p><br/><p>And soon Sof\u00eda, who was holding onto Camille, aggressively launched off from the ground.</p><br/><p>Kwaaaaaang.</p><br/><p>Soon Sof\u00eda who was holding onto Camille disappeared to the distant Base Root while giving off a loud noise.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s completely dead.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo stopped on the way down and then approached the Devouring and Vomiting Root that had completely stopped working.</p><br/><p>Since it could not maintain its huge body once the Divine Stone Fragment was extracted.</p><br/><p>Hansoo went inside the body and then cut up a certain section.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is it.\u2019</p><br/><p>An Organ the size of Hansoo\u2019s head that was located deep within the Core of the main body.</p><br/><p>This was the Core Memory Drive Organ that had all the genetic information of the beasts within it.</p><br/><p>Hansoo quickly moved towards Michael after taking the Memory Drive Organ.</p><br/><p>It was much easier to receive the help of the Clan in order to find out information about the changes around the World Tree.</p><br/><p>Since the influence of Lighthouse, one of the Six Great Pillars, had reached every corner.</p><br/><p>It was just that 150 of them had fallen here but there was around ten thousand and around 40 sub-clans.</p><br/><p>They would be able to find it out immediately no matter what the Clan tried to do.</p><br/><p>Kuuoooong</p><br/><p>Michael made a bitter expression as he looked at Hansoo who had fitted himself with a brand new armor.</p><br/><p>An Armor that didn\u2019t seem simple at a single glance.</p><br/><p>\u2018Where does this guy keep picking up all these things?\u2019</p><br/><p>He started to understand why this guy had denied his offer around this point.</p><br/><p>The moment Hansoo looked at that Michael and tried to explain his situation a loud shockwave resonated from the World Tree Root above.</p><br/><p>Kugugugu</p><br/><p>To the point where the noise made that far above resonated to them who were underground.</p><br/><p>The vibrations became bigger and bigger then something penetrated the wall of the underground area and came down.</p><br/><p>Booom!</p><br/><p>\u201cKuuu\u2026. What is this.\u201d</p><br/><p>While Michael was frowning, something walked out from the dust.</p><br/><p>\u201cWoah. Michael. It\u2019s been a while. It has been 6 months since we last saw each other right?\u201d</p><br/><p>At those words Michael grinded his teeth.</p><br/><p>\u201cSof\u00eda\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Goddamnit.\u2019</p><br/><p>Michael frowned.</p><br/><p>He had gained the intel before he had been swallowed up by the Devil\u2019s Mouth.</p><br/><p>That one of the Seven Departed Souls was roaming around this place.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why did it have to be that damned bitch.\u2019</p><br/><p>While Michael grinded his teeth, Sof\u00eda put down the dizzy Camille and then looked around at her surroundings.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is that guy Hansoo.\u2019</p><br/><p>She knew instantly.</p><br/><p>Since he was the only one here she had not seen before.</p><br/><p>The others were people she had collided with once or twice when she went up against Michael in the past.</p><br/><p>Sof\u00eda looked at Hansoo and then opened her trait, the Library.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s see.\u2019</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>-1st Year Adventurer.</p><br/><p>-Owned Skill: 1.</p><br/><p>-Average Rune Amount: 39.4%</p><br/><p>Though it didn\u2019t really show up in front of her like this but it came down to this once she organized the things that came up in her head.</p><br/><p>It seemed almost like hacking but his limits were clear as well.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that clear but she could guess her opponent to a degree using her experiences so far.</p><br/><p>And Sof\u00eda frowned because of this.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026He killed the Calamity Fish with this?\u2019</p><br/><p>And it seemed like he had killed the main body of the Devil\u2019s Mouth as well.</p><br/><p>\u2018No way.\u2019</p><br/><p>The fact that he was very lacking was enough.</p><br/><p>A first year who only had one skill with runes less than 50%.</p><br/><p>Though it was amazing for a 1st year but that was just relative in the end.</p><br/><p>If he was compared to the rest of the Red Zone then he couldn\u2019t even reach the middle.</p><br/><p>\u2018How did he kill it with that level\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>And if he did kill it, what level would he reach once he filled up all his runes.</p><br/><p>\u2018I need to see the level of the Artifact\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Right as Sof\u00eda was about to check Hansoo with more detail, Hansoo looked at Sof\u00eda and spoke out.</p><br/><p>\u201cTry focusing on something else other than me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment something came into Sof\u00eda\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>Sof\u00eda\u2019s expressions froze at the sudden strange feeling that had come into her head.</p><br/><p>This strong sensation that her trait was transmitting to her.</p><br/><p>Danger.</p><br/><p>And only really big danger at that.</p><br/><p>\u2018Something\u2019s coming down\u2026 From up?\u2019</p><br/><p>Sof\u00eda felt the slight vibrations along the World Tree as she looked at the hole she had made on the way in high up in the World Tree Root.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Kurururururu</p><br/><p>A humongous snake was coiled around the World Tree.</p><br/><p>Ouroboros.</p><br/><p>The easiest Calamity to confirm with the eyes unlike the others.</p><br/><p>Actually this guy didn\u2019t really directly hurt humans.</p><br/><p>There was only one thing it did.</p><br/><p>It drank the Toxic Waters supplied to the World Tree after biting around the Pillar in the middle with its head that was larger than a small island.</p><br/><p>Of course the people below will starve since that thing would drain the toxic waters that was going to be turned into Nutritional Fluids by the World Tree but they stayed like that.</p><br/><p>Since they didn\u2019t want to even imagine the case where that thing would get pissed and come down.</p><br/><p>An existence that they were thankful for staying still.</p><br/><p>At the same time that thing was one of the few methods for the people living at the Roots to reach the Branch safely.</p><br/><p>Since it was very hard even for adventures of the Red Zone to climb up to the Branch that reached over the clouds without getting tired.</p><br/><p>But they could reach their destinations with much more ease by stepping atop the body which coiled around the tree and had its tail around the ground.</p><br/><p>So a lot of people stepped on its body and headed towards the Branch but there was still a location they never got close to.</p><br/><p>Head.</p><br/><p>This thing will ruthlessly attack once they get near the head that was drinking the toxic waters.</p><br/><p>But there was a person who had reached the head.</p><br/><p>The Clone, who had now found his name to be Tekilon, entered through one of the countless gaps between the Scales.</p><br/><p>The Ouroboros was also growing a huge number of parasites within its body for defensive purposes but they moved aside after looking at Tekilon.</p><br/><p>Kugugugugu</p><br/><p>Tekilon, who had arrived inside the head, places his hand on the central nervous system as he quickly tapped into the Ouroboros using his power.</p><br/><p>Kuuuuuuuuu</p><br/><p>Though the Ouroboros was slightly guarded against the strange creature that had invaded its</p><br/><p>head but it didn\u2019t act rashly.</p><br/><p>Since it was quite confused.</p><br/><p>The guy felt like his creator but was different from the creator in some ways.</p><br/><p>That difference was making the Ouroboros hesitate. At that moment a command flew into his head.</p><br/><p>The Ouroboros screamed out in dissatisfaction at those commands.</p><br/><p>Kurururururu</p><br/><p>It was eating.</p><br/><p>For the thing to disturb him eating when he didn\u2019t even seem like a complete creator.</p><br/><p>Then the Creator-like creature who had seen the reaction of Ouroboros made a new command instead.</p><br/><p>&lt;\u2026 Then just close all the pores in the body except the Mouth.&gt;</p><br/><p>Kirururuk</p><br/><p>That wouldn\u2019t be a problem.</p><br/><p>The Ouroboros covered its whole body with its steel-plate-like scales.</p><br/><p>Tekilon clicked his tongue as he saw the reaction of Ouroboros.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damnit. I set the instinct of wanting food too strong on this guy. It\u2019ll take a while.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tekilon slowly invaded it so he wouldn\u2019t irritate it.</p><br/><p>Since this thing could go crazy if he tried to get it under his command from the get-go.</p><br/><p>Quite a large amount of time was needed to him to fill up his greed for food.</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t have time.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tekilon clenched his teeth.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know how much time had past between his last and current memory.</p><br/><p>He wanted to go down with Ouroboros and crush them when he thought of his race who would\u2019ve died and will continue to die while he bought time.</p><br/><p>Anyways, he didn\u2019t need to care about the people who had landed here unlike the Elvenheim who took a bit of effort.</p><br/><p>But Tekilon was breathing in and out alone.</p><br/><p>\u20182 weeks. I can control it after 2 weeks. I will take this guy and go down in 2 weeks.\u2019</p><br/><p>He wouldn\u2019t be able to come in and set up a trap since all the pores were closed and if he were to get frustrated and then attack then Ouroboros will smash him apart.</p><br/><p>\u2018There\u2019s no need to hurry.\u2019</p><br/><p>He was used to waiting.</p><br/><p>Since there were memories he had suppressed during the time he was born as the Elvenheim and until he finished all his preparations after becoming king.</p><br/><p>And because he had held onto it for a long time and prepared for it, he was able to attack the Elvenheims when they weren\u2019t suspecting and could go against the army of the Five Great Tiger generals who rushed in to stop the crazy king and the Calamities.</p><br/><p>Tekilon put his hands on the central nervous system of the Ouroborus who was busy eating as he gave the strongest order he could give.</p><br/><p>Though it was hard to make it stop eating and go down since it had a large liking for toxic waters but everything else wasn\u2019t that hard.</p><br/><p>\u2018I guess I need to open it for a moment.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tekilon gave his orders as soon as he finished his decision.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cHooh. It\u2019s really high.\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the Hecate Clansmen spoke out after seeing the scene that could be seen below her feet as she was climbing up the Pillar on Ouroboros.</p><br/><p>The toxic sea that was spread far and wide endlessly.</p><br/><p>And the wide World Tree Mountain Range that was on top of it.</p><br/><p>Though it had dried up, the sheer size of it covered over it and showing quite a spectacle.</p><br/><p>The woman, Chwee, who had been climbing up with the man, Ben, who was applauding the scene spoke as she laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cBetter artifacts come out if you go up a bit more from here. Be strong a bit longer. We need to gear ourselves anyway since we\u2019ll be going over to the next zone soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ben replied at these words.</p><br/><p>\u201cLike the Seven Departed Souls?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chwee slightly frowned as she nodded.</p><br/><p>Seven Departed Souls.</p><br/><p>People who had filled up the requirements to go up and had grown strong to the point where they would threaten all of the Six Great Pillars by themselves and had not gone up for some reason.</p><br/><p>If you average out of the years the Seven Departed Souls stayed within the Red Zone then it was 11.</p><br/><p>People who had gotten stronger and stronger by staying in the Red Zone for almost around 11 years.</p><br/><p>Actually there were some 1st years.</p><br/><p>People who had come to this world with Eres or Keldian who had left behind a legend.</p><br/><p>Which meant that they had stayed in the Red Zone for 20 years alone.</p><br/><p>And because of this they were called Departed Souls.</p><br/><p>They would usually call those people seniles but they were too afraid to.</p><br/><p>\u2018They aren\u2019t right in their heads.\u2019</p><br/><p>Chwee blessed her thoughts as she spoke while smiling.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Where do you think the Seven Departed Souls have gotten those Rare artifacts from?</p><br/><p>Kuhuhu. They say we might be able to obtain the feather if we\u2019re lucky.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow. Then there are more reasons to go up then.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t even want the top class artifacts that the Seven Departed Souls had.</p><br/><p>They would be able to equip themselves with gear a full tier up once they gained a single feather.</p><br/><p>Ben started to quickly walk upwards as if those words energized him.</p><br/><p>At that moment a strange sound was heard from somewhere.</p><br/><p>Kidududududuk.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ben, who was quite sensitive enough to the point of working as a member of the Search team of the Hecate Clan, quickly looked around.</p><br/><p>The surface of the Ouroboros, which was covered with scales that were few meters long, was shaking up and down.</p><br/><p>Then something started to crawl out from between the scales.</p><br/><p>Ben was shocked once he saw this.</p><br/><p>\u201cUaaaak! Parasites!\u201d</p><br/><p>The things the people, who entered Ouroboros without knowing the dangers through the Scales, met first.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamnit! Run!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ben and Chwee looked at the giant parasites that reached over 4m in height as they started to madly run atop of Ouroboros.</p><br/><p>Billions of grasshopper-shaped parasites crawled out as they started to attack.</p><br/><p>Proofreader\u2019s note</p><br/><p>Sponsored chapter.</p><br/><p>This is the 6th chapter overall of this week?</p><br/><p>After just finishing up this battle, Hansoo will now apparently have to face a gigantic grasshopper swarm with Sof\u00eda.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

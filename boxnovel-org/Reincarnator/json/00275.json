An equal number of people between clans. We can just share the rewards from in there afterwards.\u201d</p><br/><p>But as they were about to agree to this.</p><br/><p>Kiiiiiing.</p><br/><p>\u201c...What is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that from the capital? Kirkis.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the distance.</p><br/><p>A light was flickering thousands of kilometers in the distance.</p><br/><p>From the capital of the Empire.</p><br/><p>The players frowned as they saw the small but clear rainbow colored light.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid the Calicule clan receive any messages? Isn\u2019t your clan leader the owner of a territory in the Empire?\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the clansmen from the Calicule clan stayed silent but it was clear that he was confused as well from his expression.</p><br/><p>, the leader of the Calicule clan.</p><br/><p>One of the people who had achieved a tremendous amount of merit points and had been granted the ownership of a special territory right next to the capital of the Empire.</p><br/><p>Their clan leader, Astania, should know something about this.</p><br/><p>Since there were rumors saying that he had connections with Tiamet as well.</p><br/><p>But they had not received any messages regarding that.</p><br/><p>\u2018What could it be\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Everybody fell into confusion as they saw the seven colored lights that continued to flicker while continuously becoming larger and larger.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>As the administrative rights were confirmed, all of the red warning letters disappeared.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>[Administrator number 1011, Access Confirmed.]</p><br/><p>[You Are Now Allowed To Access The Mudusella System.]</p><br/><p>\u2018....Mudusella System?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s eyebrows rose up.</p><br/><p>Since Mudusella was the name of somebody he knew.</p><br/><p>But he decided to ask other things first.</p><br/><p>There was a lot he wanted to ask.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is the objective of this ship?\u201d</p><br/><p>Large words started to appear upon the panel.</p><br/><p>[The ASTRO-17 Ship\u2019s construction had started on the 19th month of year 2199 in order to reach the nearest planet, TIAMET-1131, and had completed its preparations on the 21st month of the year 2211.]</p><br/><p>\u201cReason for this objective?\u201d</p><br/><p>[To find more space for the expansion of the race.]</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded.</p><br/><p>He finally figured out the origins of this thing.</p><br/><p>\u2018Terraforming\u2026 Is that what it\u2019s doing?\u2019</p><br/><p>A few other questions appeared in his mind after finding out the objective of the ship, he decided to ask the thing he was the most curious about first.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes the race that built you exist upon this planet?\u201d</p><br/><p>This was not something the Empire and the Kingdoms, who fought with swords and built castles out of stones, could build.</p><br/><p>Even if the Empire had a lot to hide, this was clearly some super advanced technology.</p><br/><p>So he had thought this ship came from outside.</p><br/><p>But if this ship was built in order to leave the planet then the story changes.</p><br/><p>There had to be a race who had the technology to build this.</p><br/><p>A race which he could not guess the identity of no matter what.</p><br/><p>There were three possibilities.</p><br/><p>1, They left behind a few hidden ships in various locations and all went to their goal planet.</p><br/><p>2, They existed somewhere on this planet and were hiding from the eyes of others and were silently observing them.</p><br/><p>Or 3\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u2018They could\u2019ve been annihilated.\u2019</p><br/><p>Depending on which of the three it was, his plans would be affected in a huge manner.</p><br/><p>It would be good if it was number 1 or 3 but if it was 2 where another race was silently observing him then he would need to prepare for this variable as well.</p><br/><p>Hansoo smiled bitterly.</p><br/><p>\u2018...These worlds are like damn onions.\u2019</p><br/><p>He knew that he couldn\u2019t prepare for everything even if he came from the future.</p><br/><p>Since this world that God had prepared for them was not something they should conquer but rather run away from.</p><br/><p>A maze-like place where they trembled in fear while passing through.</p><br/><p>But as his plans succeeded and the worlds were conquered, these worlds were like treasure chests as they continuously took out new things to throw at his feet.</p><br/><p>In a huge scale.</p><br/><p>Hansoo quietly waited for the reply.</p><br/><p>It was a good thing in the end.</p><br/><p>Since him worrying about something that hid in the shadows meant that his light had reached and drove away the darkness from the corners of the world.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s hear this out. Which of the three it is.\u2019</p><br/><p>But sadly, It didn\u2019t fully fulfill Hansoo\u2019s expectations instantly.</p><br/><p>Kiiiiiiingg!</p><br/><p>Instead of the answer to Hansoo\u2019s question, a different type of information appeared.</p><br/><p>[...Energy wave similar to weapon type ZA-114 detected.]</p><br/><p>[Converting all surplus energy into Resonance Shield.]</p><br/><p>[ETA : 3.1131 seconds. Prepare for impact.]</p><br/><p>Normal people might not have understood these strange words.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo realized what was going on in an instant.</p><br/><p>\u2018...They did something.\u2019</p><br/><p>Even he could feel the tremendous amount of energy approaching the ship from deep inside it.</p><br/><p>As if they had converted the giant formation of the War Fortress into a cannon.</p><br/><p>Chiiiiiiiiing!</p><br/><p>All the lights inside the colony started to turn off.</p><br/><p>As if they were gathering energy into a specific point.</p><br/><p>Crunch! Crunch!</p><br/><p>As Hansoo planted his feet onto the floor of the ship in preparation for the impact.</p><br/><p>Booooooom!</p><br/><p>A humongous tremor shook the entire ship.</p><br/><p>Rumble.</p><br/><p>The giant sphere next to him trembled as it started to let a blinding amount of light.</p><br/><p>Soon, after the shock passed by.</p><br/><p>The System\u2019s panel showed him the current information.</p><br/><p>[Remaining Shield : 85.1%]</p><br/><p>[...Calculating situation.]</p><br/><p>[In case of continuous bombardment, chance to fall before leaving the atmosphere...98.1%]</p><br/><p>[Flight to outer planets judged impossible in the current situation, beginning movement towards the closest colony according to emergency protocol.]</p><br/><p>[Setting flight path\u2026]</p><br/><p>[Flight path confirmed.

We won\u2019t blow up before?\u201d</p><br/><p>If it would explode then he needed to get off the ship as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>But the system gave a rather positive reply.</p><br/><p>[If the weapon attacking us has similar recharge times to Weapon Type ZA-114 then it is possible]</p><br/><p>\u201cThe shield can hold on?\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the most important part.</p><br/><p>But sadly, the system\u2019s reply wasn\u2019t good.</p><br/><p>[Currently remaining shield amount is 70.7%.]</p><br/><p>[The shield will be destroyed. One extra strike after the destruction of shield is allowed.

What\u2019s in it?\u2019</p><br/><p>It was different from any spirit he had seen before.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t have the red glow of a flame spirit, the dark glow of a dark spirit or even the bright blue light of a ice spirit.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well. I\u2019ll find out after I get it.\u2019</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>Another strike landed on the ship as the ship accelerated further.</p><br/><p>Hansoo decided to stay on the ship until the end.</p><br/><p>Since the weapon could aim at him instead of this giant ship if he got off.</p><br/><p>It was better to get across the mountain range and disappear from view.</p><br/><p>Hansoo raised his hand towards the mysterious glass orb that had numerous dozens of colors intermingled with each other.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Whooooosh!</p><br/><p>And Hansoo felt the conscious of something from the flask entering his head.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t really feel good but he knew.</p><br/><p>That he would need to get friendlier with this from now on.</p><br/><p>He had gained a powerful ally.</p><br/><p>Oooooong.</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s eyes slowly closed as he felt the foreign consciousness entering his mind.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>As if the ship was preparing for an emergency landing, countless screens that showed the current situation outside the ship appeared in various locations inside the ship.</p><br/><p>And everything outside the ship was being shown.</p><br/><p>Including the beam of light heading towards the ship.</p><br/><p>As well as the mountain range in front of the ship.</p><br/><p>Though it felt like he had climbed at least 20 km above, they were still a bit away from the top of the mountain range.</p><br/><p>But soon.</p><br/><p>Whooosh!</p><br/><p>The scenery past the mountain range appeared on the screens.</p><br/><p>Clouds, blizzards and mists.</p><br/><p>The thing Tiamet wanted to keep hidden from the world.</p><br/><p>And the closing eyes of Hansoo got focused onto the screen.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is what\u2019s beyond the mountain range\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>But even before Hansoo could check the scene clearly.</p><br/><p>Somebody spoke to Hansoo.</p><br/><p>From inside him.</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s consciousness got sucked inside as his body fell to the ground.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

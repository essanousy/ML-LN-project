Don\u2019t you know how selfish they are? Why would they send a message when it\u2019s almost been killed?\u201d</p><br/><p>Anyone would have figured it out after some short thought.</p><br/><p>That those guys weren\u2019t that kind-hearted.</p><br/><p>Which meant that this was a trap.</p><br/><p>But who would buy them time if everyone knew it was a trap?</p><br/><p>If that thing had made a trap, then that meant a trap was needed.</p><br/><p>A trap being needed also meant that somebody needed to fall into the trap.</p><br/><p>So he had indeed lured them away.</p><br/><p>To rouse their innate greed and competitiveness.</p><br/><p>\u2018Retards. That\u2019s what you get when strength is handed over to you.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hermes clicked his tongue.</p><br/><p>The only ones with the right to possess strength were those who\u2019d gone through countless struggles, and could make the correct decision in any situation.</p><br/><p>Like Ekidu or Karhal.</p><br/><p>But weak people who run away from danger were bound to act stupidly after they gained strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cf***\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, is there an issue?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hermes was confused at Zeus who was looking at him in anger.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t matter right?</p><br/><p>Those guys weren\u2019t pushovers.</p><br/><p>It would be for the better if they weakened the monster\u2019s strength as they fought.</p><br/><p>Zeus remembered a fact he had forgotten to mention.</p><br/><p>\u2018Dumbass\u2026 That thing gets stronger the more it eats\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Of course he wouldn\u2019t have been able to imagine it if Hansoo hadn\u2019t told him either.</p><br/><p>For something to eat and absorb the skills, intellect and memories of the things it had eaten.</p><br/><p>This dumbass just handed over 7 huge chunks of meat.</p><br/><p>Hansoo chuckled from behind and whispered.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about it? Now you understand why I wanted to put leashes on you guys right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hermes\u2019s expression froze.</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t Zeus said he wanted them to gather for a cooperation?</p><br/><p>What was a leash about?</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>The space below Hermes exploded as his body disappeared.</p><br/><p>His skill, , sent him hundreds of meters away in an instant.</p><br/><p>\u2018I was fooled!\u2019</p><br/><p>Hermes grinded his teeth.</p><br/><p>He was laughing at those who had fallen into that monster\u2019s trap but it seems he has also fallen into a trap.</p><br/><p>By walking into it as well.</p><br/><p>\u2018What a dumb move on my part\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Hermes ran away on his maximum speed.</p><br/><p>Chills continued to run down his back.</p><br/><p>The expression of the worried Zeus and the screaming Dark King at the elevator flashed by his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2018Still...It won\u2019t be easy to catch me.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hermes signed out in relief as he ran away.</p><br/><p>He could feel the presence of that guy getting further behind him.</p><br/><p>He had been able to even run away from that monster.</p><br/><p>In terms of speed, he was the fastest out of the twelve.</p><br/><p>Zeus grinded his teeth as he looked at Hermes running away at an explosive speed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you gonig to let him go?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo chuckled at Zeus\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Crunch.</p><br/><p>Crack.</p><br/><p>Strange changes started to happen on Hansoo\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>The dragonic energy, which hadn\u2019t been able to shine properly because of the Pandemic Blade, started to spread all over his body.</p><br/><p>His muscles bulged.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t three like when he went through the Racial Metamorphsis, but his now even more powerful two hearts were pumping blood throughout his body at a crazy rate.</p><br/><p>The Mana Jade, which had now completely integrated with his body, was pouring out mana like a storm.</p><br/><p>And changes weren\u2019t only occuring on the insides.</p><br/><p>Chiiiik.</p><br/><p>An extremely thin layer of transparent scales appeared and covered his skin.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Tdddddk.</p><br/><p>\u2018WHAT THE HELL!!\u2019</p><br/><p>Zeus\u2019s jaws dropped as he looked at Hansoo\u2019s change.</p><br/><p>How was it possible?</p><br/><p>For horns to grow from the head of a human.</p><br/><p>But it had really happened, in front of his eyes.</p><br/><p>Tddk.</p><br/><p>Two horns were growing out from Hansoo\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t large but those two horns clearly indicated his difference from humans.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>A tremendous flood of aura exploded out from his body.</p><br/><p>Energy created from mixing the dark gold energy of the Demonic Dragon\u2019s Reinforcement and his newly evolved red Pandemic blade.</p><br/><p>And Zeus slowly backed up as he saw this.</p><br/><p>With the melted down land as the background.</p><br/><p>A man with two horns was standing while releasing a horrifying aura.</p><br/><p>\u2018f***\u2026 We were all just playing house compared to this guy\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>As Zeus, or Miguel, tried his best to suppress the fear rising from his mind.</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked towards the direction Hermes had disappeared to.</p><br/><p>Though their strength was useful, they were using it in the wrong methods.</p><br/><p>And Eres wanted him to kill them all.</p><br/><p>But that was such a waste, was it not?</p><br/><p>If he can just perform on them, they would become very useful.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha! Farewell!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo smiled as he heard the voice of Hermes echoing out from the distance.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yeah. My actual job is to put dog leashes on you and whip you around.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo tightly grasped the Forked Lightning in his hand.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Booooom!</p><br/><p>The golden spear in Hansoo\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>Split through space and disappeared into the horizon.</p><br/><p>Towards Hermes who was smiling as if he had successfully ran away.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Crunch.</p><br/><p>Crunch crunch.</p><br/><p>Hephaestus freaked out as he saw the monster devouring Hera while having the form of Ares.</p><br/><p>\u2018...f***!\u2019</p><br/><p>Hera\u2019s look mixed in with the look of Ares it was transformed.</p><br/><p>Something continued to bubble up above as it continued to transform back from woman to man.</p><br/><p>Demeter, Artemis and Poseidon\u2019s faces all appeared and disappeared one by one.</p><br/><p>Hephaestus turned and started to run away at this horrendous sight.</p><br/><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><br/><p>He had originally been proud of his large body but now, he was deeply hating it.</p><br/><p>The thing had stopped imitating others now.</p><br/><p>The dark humanoid creature stared at the running Hephaestus for a moment.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Boom! Boom!</p><br/><p>It started to charge over.</p><br/><p>With a huge desire to devour him.</p><br/><p>It just needed one more.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t even need the others running behind him.</p><br/><p>If it could eat this one, it would evolve into a whole another creature.</p><br/><p>It could then figure out the identity of the annoying aura that had been continuously pestering it and pull it out of its roots.</p><br/><p>Kyaaaaak!</p><br/><p>The black Ark-Roa\u2019s hand extended out as it chased after the running Hephaestus.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhh! You bastards! Wait for me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaa\u2026! Haaa!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Dark king ignored the desperate screams of Hephaetus as he madly clawed away with his arms.</p><br/><p>It was slowler than running but this was what was allowing him to live.</p><br/><p>He had naturally fallen behind because he had been slow and that had helped him to be the furthest away from the monster.</p><br/><p>\u2018F***...F***! Wasn\u2019t it the end after becoming a transcendent?\u2019</p><br/><p>Crunch Crunch!</p><br/><p>Other transcendents caught up to the Dark King who had been running away while cursing.</p><br/><p>Only four of them had been left other than Hephaestus in the distance.</p><br/><p>Dionysus, Apollon and Hades.</p><br/><p>But they seemed to be quite calm as they were running.</p><br/><p>And the Dark King was at a loss.</p><br/><p>\u2018Retards, do you think surviving here is the end?\u2019</p><br/><p>Of course he himself would be caught before them.</p><br/><p>He was weaker and he didn\u2019t have his legs either.</p><br/><p>But what about after him?</p><br/><p>There was nowhere to run from this hell.</p><br/><p>And as if Apollon had read his mind, he kicked the Dark King while frowning.</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>\u201cKuaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just a normal kick.</p><br/><p>His arm burnt up as the kick had been imbued with flames.</p><br/><p>Tatatata!</p><br/><p>The Dark King couldn\u2019t withstand the pain as he rolled on the ground as Apollon laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha! You should just become food since your legs are cut off anyway! I didn\u2019t injure you that much so good luck!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou f***ing bastard!\u201d</p><br/><p>That guy hadn\u2019t let him off easy for him.</p><br/><p>It was only because the less injured he was, the longer he would be able to fight.</p><br/><p>And into the ears of the Dark King.</p><br/><p>The desperate calls of Hephaestus could be heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhh! f*** off!\u201d</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>Kyaaa!</p><br/><p>The Dark King fell into despair as it looked at the mysterious dark creature who had caught up to Hephaestus.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Rumble!</p><br/><p>Dionysus asked with a worried expression after running for a bit longer.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! What are you going to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>They would be able to escape for now but an answer not existing was still the case.</p><br/><p>But Hades replied instead.</p><br/><p>\u201cAthena. Find her. She might have some methods up her sleeve.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...Against that thing? Even if she does, do you even know where she is?\u201d</p><br/><p>And Dionysus was shocked as he saw Hades nodding his head.</p><br/><p>Athena had always been very mysterious and lonesome.</p><br/><p>Boom! Boom!</p><br/><p>Apollon shouted at Dionysus.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that really what\u2019s important!? Let\u2019s just agree to not backstab each other first\u2026 Even if the others die, we have to survive and go up. Okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>He could not die.</p><br/><p>The world was such an amazing place, how could he die like this?</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Sssss.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. You won\u2019t be able to backstab anymore. I don\u2019t know about surviving and going up though.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Apollon freaked out as a man appeared out of thin air in front of him.</p><br/><p>Where did he come from?</p><br/><p>But even before he could complete this thought.</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s right hand swung at him and smashed onto his stomach.</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>\u201cKuaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was a light punch, don\u2019t overreact.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dionysus trembled in fear at the man who had appeared out of thin air and had attacked Apollon.</p><br/><p>\u2018Light?\u2019</p><br/><p>One attack.</p><br/><p>One attack was enough to cause Apoolon to scream out and fall onto the ground with a huge indent on his stomach.</p><br/><p>This was light?</p><br/><p>\u2018...Where did this f***er pop out from?\u2019</p><br/><p>He wanted to run but his feet didn\u2019t listen to him.</p><br/><p>Since he felt like he would get killed the moment he tried.</p><br/><p>Hansoo spoke as he looked at the one rolling around the ground and the two frozen in place.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll have to recycle for now. If your friendship hasn\u2019t changed\u2026 Then you guys would\u2019ve been a bit happier.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo chucked as he sensed the exploding aura of the monster.</p><br/><p>If these guys worked together to fight and didn\u2019t abandon their comrades then they would\u2019ve bought enough time until he got here.</p><br/><p>And he would\u2019ve been able to easily suppress the Ark-Roa.</p><br/><p>But it seems the Ark-Roa has been able to pick them out one by one and successfully evolve.</p><br/><p>Whatever.</p><br/><p>Fighting that thing was part of these guys\u2019s destiny as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cF***ing...Hell.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Apollon spoke out in despair.</p><br/><p>Rumble.</p><br/><p>A dark red aura started to seep out around Hansoo.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

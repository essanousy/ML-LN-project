It took way too long.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo grinded his teeth.</p><br/><p>There weren\u2019t any artifacts that weren\u2019t damaged either.</p><br/><p>A few seemed to be in good condition but they all turned into dust that scattered as if they had a problem with them.</p><br/><p>\u2018It seems I must renew them all\u2019.</p><br/><p>These artifacts couldn\u2019t be used in the Red Zone, where he will be soon, anyways.</p><br/><p>And it wasn\u2019t really a waste if what he had gained was taken into account.</p><br/><p>Hansoo, who threw out every artifact on his body other than the Nurmaha\u2019s Ring, estimated the time and then clicked his tongue.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026There\u2019s two hours left now.\u2019</p><br/><p>90th day.</p><br/><p>2 hours before the tutorial ends.</p><br/><p>After seeing the way the water was rising, everything would be submerged after two hours.</p><br/><p>Most people would have already set off.</p><br/><p>Hansoo jumped off as he looked below the tower and dug his hand onto the wall of the tower.</p><br/><p>Kwadududuk.</p><br/><p>The red, and not colorless, runes started to twist the laws of Hansoo\u2019s body and his hands, which had been strengthened by this, started to smash the walls.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo kept that speed, from the rebound force of his action, constant as he rode down the tower.</p><br/><p>Hooooooong.</p><br/><p>\u2018Go through from the 4th floor.\u2019</p><br/><p>The entrance which Ralph Lauren had come out from.</p><br/><p>And the tower\u2019s topmost floor.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019ll be a bit tight. To make the Ship.\u2019</p><br/><p>You needed the Ship prepared by the fairy in order to go from the Colorless Zone to the Red Zone.</p><br/><p>Since this place would completely sink.</p><br/><p>Hansoo ran towards the on the 4th floor as fast as he could.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201cGoddamnit! Those bitches from the Clan Alliance! For them to really leave us and go!\u201d</p><br/><p>Gumchan and the seven others grinded their teeth as they searched around the insides of the jungle.</p><br/><p>\u2018Those crazy bastards\u2026 they leave even when they had room to spare?\u2019</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t much resentment about the Ship made by the Free Alliance, which had set off 4 days ago, since they were the ones who chose not to get on but they didn\u2019t know that the guys of the Clan Alliance would act like this.</p><br/><p>And because of that they were searching around the jungle like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry! We need to find the Kuron Parasite and get it over there!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kuron Parasite.</p><br/><p>They had gathered all of the other materials for the Ship in the 2 days after the departure of the Clan Alliance but they didn\u2019t acquire the Kuron Parasite yet.</p><br/><p>And the fairy would only make the Ship for them if they give the Kuron parasite to it.</p><br/><p>But one of the people running spoke while making an anxious expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! But the Kuron Parasite is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Then Gumchan shouted as he grinded his teeth.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit! Then what! We can\u2019t make the Ship without that!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kuron Parasite.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t much about it.</p><br/><p>It was so weak that it would die if you tapped it around a bit.</p><br/><p>The problem was where they parasited on.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>A 30m big giant crocodile that lived in the swamps of the inner parts of the wide 4th floor.</p><br/><p>It had kindly been written in the catalogue for making the Ship by the fairy that it lived in the inside of the Galapagon Crocodile\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>Since there were basic explanations about the Ship and the places to gather the material for it.</p><br/><p>They had promised themselves that they would never come back here after seeing an adventurer, who was trying to get the material, get his leg torn off but for them to come back here like this.</p><br/><p>\u2018Dammit\u2026 there\u2019s nothing we can do.\u2019</p><br/><p>Gumchan grinded his teeth.</p><br/><p>They had to make the Ship.</p><br/><p>A few people, who had gotten anxious after the Clan Alliance left, cut off a few trees in the jungle and tried to get to the by making a raft and getting onto the sea.</p><br/><p>The result was misery in itself.</p><br/><p>They had all died after getting infected from the waves of poison.</p><br/><p>You could stay afloat for a while but if you sink then your whole body will melt.</p><br/><p>The fairy giggled at that as if it was extremely funny and spoke.</p><br/><p>And everyone who had seen this started searching the all around the 4th floor.</p><br/><p>Since they might really melt down if they aren\u2019t able to get the materials in time.</p><br/><p>This was already 2 days ago.</p><br/><p>And now there were probably less than 2 hours left.</p><br/><p>The Free Alliance and the Clan Alliance each made a giant Ship that would still have space left after holding 2000 people.</p><br/><p>They had become like this because they saw each of the 500 Free Alliance and the 600 Clan Alliance make a Ship to carry 2000 and had thought that they would take them and had leisurely hunted.</p><br/><p>If they had faithfully prepared the Ship for a month then they wouldn\u2019t have fallen into such a dangerous situation.</p><br/><p>\u2018Dammit\u2026 We should\u2019ve gotten the materials despite the dangers. Or we should have followed the Free Alliance.\u2019</p><br/><p>After a bit of running, he could see the shady swamp in the distance.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Why did they make such a large Ship if they weren\u2019t gonna take us with them.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had run in a hurry but then he felt anxious again.</p><br/><p>If the monsters they needed to kill in order to get the materials were easy then they would\u2019ve done so already.</p><br/><p>But as if it wasn\u2019t only him who had thought this, the footsteps of 6 others behind him were slowing down as well.</p><br/><p>And at that moment a voice was heard above them.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to kill it? Then I shall do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUuk?\u201d</p><br/><p>When they looked up after getting shocked they could see a man running between the branches of the jungle.</p><br/><p>And there was a very unique thing about him.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026He has nothing on his body?\u2019</p><br/><p>To have nothing on his body.</p><br/><p>Unlike the third floor of the tutorial where everyone had been separated, the fourth floor was a large area where all the survivors could stay together.</p><br/><p>Of course it was a huge area but they had seen a lot of different kinds of people due to the fact that the areas weren\u2019t isolated.</p><br/><p>And a few people out of the 2000 survivors caught the eye.</p><br/><p>Like Park Gyungmi\u2019s special force clan that was famous for being a small group of elites despite her being a Lord.</p><br/><p>The incredibly strong guy with a strange mask.</p><br/><p>But it was the first time he had someone run about without anything on their body.</p><br/><p>\u2018No. He has a single ring on.\u2019</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t have any solutions but this guy was something else.</p><br/><p>No, he didn\u2019t even know how to deal with this because such a unique guy had suddenly popped out.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell yeah. Since there\u2019s more than one of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even before they could do anything, the guy who had finished talking ran into the swamp.</p><br/><p>They gazed blankly for a moment and then asked Gumchan.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gumchan pondered for a moment and then opened his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like he\u2019s going to fight, we should go and see the situation as we\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>Before he could finish his words, a dark golden light penetrated through the swamp along with a giant noise.</p><br/><p>Kuuuuaaaak!</p><br/><p>And then a very loud scream that vibrated throughout the swamp exploded out.</p><br/><p>Galapagon Crocodile\u2019s Scream.</p><br/><p>When the surprised group ran over, they saw an unbelievable sight.</p><br/><p>The giant crocodile had its skull crushed and the man was pulling out the Kuron Parasite from the insides of its mouth which he had split apart.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026the fuck. What did he crush it with? Skill?\u2019</p><br/><p>The thickness of his skull that they could see between the broken bones were over 50 cm thick and it seemed like it wasn\u2019t normal bones from the shininess.</p><br/><p>But it had been broken apart like tofu.</p><br/><p>The fourth floor was indeed very large but it wasn\u2019t so wide to the point where a rumor wouldn\u2019t get spread around.</p><br/><p>If he was that strong than they should\u2019ve at least heard about him at least once but they had never heard about him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is that him? He doesn\u2019t have the chain scythe and dagger\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>And as they heard, that guy did not use any skills ever.</p><br/><p>There was probably a reason why he couldn\u2019t use it.</p><br/><p>But that shining light was definitely the effect of a skill.</p><br/><p>\u2018Dammit\u2026 I don\u2019t know who he is. Did he gain something through a fortuitous encounter or something.\u2019</p><br/><p>While Gumchan was shocked, one of the people with Gumchan shouted out even before he could stop him,</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Wait a moment!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>When the guy turned around one of the people behind Gumchan shouted loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like you don\u2019t have a Ship either, how about going with us? We have everything but that parasite!\u201d</p><br/><p>Though they wanted to get a free ride only a single Kuron Parasite lived within each crocodile.</p><br/><p>And he didn\u2019t know what that guy did but for him to have the strength to crush that giant crocodile with a single strike meant that opposing him in terms of strength was impossible.</p><br/><p>The Galapagon Crocodile itself was burdensome, it didn\u2019t make any sense to go up against such a person who killed it with a single strike.</p><br/><p>But there was no need to actually fight.</p><br/><p>The Ship they could make with the materials they had and the Kuron Parasite could easily hold ten people.</p><br/><p>It was enough for them seven and that one man to get on.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>While Gumchan made a satisfied expression, a few people came through the swamp while gasping for air.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? You gained the Kuron Parasite?\u201d</p><br/><p>They were all gasping for air and had lights shining in their eyes.</p><br/><p>They could only be anxious since they didn\u2019t make the Ship while the toxic water was rising by the minute.</p><br/><p>They had gained all the easy materials in the two days after the Clan Alliance had left but there were more people who had been wandering around the swamp due to the fear of it than they had thought.</p><br/><p>They had all gathered here as they heard the scream of the Galapagon Crocodile dying.</p><br/><p>The man standing in the front shouted loudly at Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Did you kill it for those guys? Then help us kill it too!\u201d</p><br/><p>And then Gumchan shouted in confusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about! We didn\u2019t tell him to kill it but rather gave a proposal! Do you think we\u2019re trying to get a free ride? We\u2019re willing to give him all the other materials!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then the man standing in the very front smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s even better. Does it really need to be you guys?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man ignored Gumchan and then shouted at Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have all the other materials as well! But our Ship is a 20 man Ship! We just couldn\u2019t get the Ship because we didn\u2019t have the parasite that the Galapagon Crocodile was guarding over! Isn\u2019t it better for you guys to go to a bigger Ship?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man spoke with confidence.</p><br/><p>As he saw it, the amateurs over there had only seven people.</p><br/><p>The Ship they were preparing were probably a 10 man.</p><br/><p>On the other hand they had 13 people and had a bit more leisure so the Ship they had prepared was a 20 man Ship of a slightly larger size.</p><br/><p>Wouldn\u2019t they be better.</p><br/><p>Gumchan grinded his teeth at those words.</p><br/><p>It was just as he said.</p><br/><p>They looked at the Ships that were crossing the dangerous looking sea on the direction that the fairy had pointed to.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t an issue of people on board.</p><br/><p>It was just that they would be safer the more materials they invested in order to get a bigger Ship from the fairy to travel much more safely.</p><br/><p>The fact that a lot of people could get on was just a side effect.</p><br/><p>But it wasn\u2019t only Gumchan who had become desperate at those words.</p><br/><p>There really wasn\u2019t much time left anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastard! If you do that then we have the materials as well! Let\u2019s go with us!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWith us!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit! Then at least get one for us each! We\u2019re all going to die!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Hmm\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo watched the chaos around him as he shook his head and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need those materials.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be making a 500 man Ship. You guys use that by yourselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026Isn\u2019t this guy just a maniac. Making a 500 man Ship for himself?\u2019</p><br/><p>Yohan, who had been making the 20 man Ship, was speechless.</p><br/><p>Proofreader\u2019s note</p><br/><p> in previous chapter was changed to .</p><br/><p>This is regular chapter 2/3.

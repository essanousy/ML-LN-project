If you need help then we will help you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin then looked at the tens of mountains approaching them from the distance.</p><br/><p>No, the mountain-sized Gragoses.</p><br/><p>Ones who were approaching them in order to chew down the bull-shaped Gragos.</p><br/><p>If they don\u2019t heal those guys then the Gragos they were standing on will get destroyed by the zombie-like Gragoses who were approaching them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked around.</p><br/><p>Cross clan, Enbi Arin.</p><br/><p>Rerorerore clan, Kim Gwanje.</p><br/><p>And Ariel and the other who were leaders of various other big clans.</p><br/><p>Most of the large clan\u2019s leaders were here.</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked at them and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something you need to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA big migration. We need to get everyone on this Gragos onto the black lion, before those things get here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018There\u2019s not enough time.\u2019</p><br/><p>A single Tiradus per Telautograph he needed to put the cure into.</p><br/><p>Even Hansoo would take quite a bit of time to deal with them and heal afterwards.</p><br/><p>While he kills each and every one of those and heals the Gragos, the bull will get attacked.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026So we give up this place.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo finished his thoughts and looked at Oteon.</p><br/><p>Oteon thought of giving up their Divine Beast, Gragos, and felt her insides being ripped apart but she nodded as she gave up.</p><br/><p>\u2018We need to clutch onto this chance.\u2019</p><br/><p>If Hansoo hadn\u2019t brought the Gragos here then they would\u2019ve been able to live a bit longer.</p><br/><p>But in the end the bull will have fallen to the ground due to the always increasing Margoths or the infected Gragoses.</p><br/><p>And the living things above it will die off of course.</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t wait on the Bull for an eternity.</p><br/><p>They needed to move when they had the time.</p><br/><p>They needed to live upon a powerful existence that couldn\u2019t even be compared to the bull.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou need to hurry. It wouldn\u2019t even take 3 days for those guys to get here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ariel and Enbi Arin nodded as they started to send carrier pigeons in numerous directions.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>Kooooooong.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou damned bastard! Don\u2019t push!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFucking bitch! Wanna have a go at it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The thousands of carrier pigeons which had originated from the head were sent to almost all of the nervous clansmen at the same time.</p><br/><p>The carrier pigeons which had spread to the large clans such as Cross and Rerorerore were then sent to the middle and small sized clans and then the middle and small sized clans sent them to lone adventurers whom they were friends of or had some form of a connection with.</p><br/><p>Soon a giant march from the tail of the Gragos to the Forest of Horns and finally to the black lion had been created.</p><br/><p>Though the atmosphere wasn\u2019t that great.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s chaos.\u2019</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin, who had been leading the Cross clan, clicked her tongue.</p><br/><p>Everyone had been on edge due to the clash of the Gragoses.</p><br/><p>When they had gathered the people who were usually enemies and tried to sent them across, numerous clashes occurred from all around.</p><br/><p>And there was another person who was actually creating a problem.</p><br/><p>\u201cYo, Ariel. Aren\u2019t you going to control them properly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What do you want me to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Though they bickered, most of the Margoth levels knew each other.</p><br/><p>As the usually kind Enbi Arin called her out, Ariel complained back.</p><br/><p>At the end of Ariel\u2019s sight, the person who had taken the leadership position of the Okonelly clan while Ariel had been caught, Akon, was there.</p><br/><p>Akon shouted out from the middle of the Okonelly clan.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you making us cross? What would happen when we go over there! Previous leader?\u201d</p><br/><p>Akon then mumbled inwardly.</p><br/><p>\u2018How can we trust a weakling who had been caught by the enemy.\u2019</p><br/><p>The black lion on the other side did not look like it was in its normal condition.</p><br/><p>The skin was dingy compared to the usual healthy skin and there were no living plants unlike the bull which had numerous forests and jungles all around.</p><br/><p>But the most terrifying thing were the corpses.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026Damn, people told me that the corpses that had starved to death are the most unsightly.\u2019</p><br/><p>Akon frowned as he looked at the corpses which he could see from multiple kilometers away.</p><br/><p>Tens of Margoths which had starved to death.</p><br/><p>That giant body had been impoverished to the point where the leather had stuck to the bones.</p><br/><p>If those things, which went crazy for the body fluids, had starved to death then the humans wouldn\u2019t have much chance.</p><br/><p>Akon sweated profusely as he shouted towards his surroundings.</p><br/><p>\u201cListen! Those guys are definitely thinking of throwing us on the black lion and leaving us! Then we would have to starve over there!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone frowned.</p><br/><p>Since that black lion definitely looked like a land without hope to them.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Is that it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat seems like it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone started to mumble.</p><br/><p>Ariel, who had been listening to this, finally realized what it felt like to die from high blood pressure.</p><br/><p>For him to act like this when they had saved their lives and were working this hard.</p><br/><p>\u2018This bastard\u2026 I can kill him with a single strike.\u2019</p><br/><p>But she didn\u2019t dare.</p><br/><p>Margoth levels weren\u2019t invincible.</p><br/><p>The clansmen who were swarming over on that side were people who she had trained well.</p><br/><p>They were not easy opponents.</p><br/><p>And most of them were thinking that his words made sense.</p><br/><p>If she were to attack that guy then it would be like adding fuel t the fire.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn\u2026 This is really embarrassing.\u2019</p><br/><p>Every other clan was heading towards to the other side without a single problem but why was her own clan doing this.</p><br/><p>Ariel frowned and then used a skill and shouted out extremely loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastards! Look at the Gragos approaching us! If you stay here you\u2019ll die anyway! Do you know how much those zombie guys tried to chew up the Bull? If you stay here then the Gragos will sink as a whole!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone nodded at those words.</p><br/><p>Though most people were skeptical of migrating, there was a reason for the crossing.</p><br/><p>They \u2018might\u2019 die from hunger if they go over there but if they stay here then they will definitely die.</p><br/><p>By sinking onto the lava.</p><br/><p>But it wasn\u2019t that Akon didn\u2019t think this far.</p><br/><p>Akon mumbled inwardly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Those guys have a method of getting rid of the Gragos who are approaching.\u2019</p><br/><p>Why would the leopard suddenly back off from the bull\u2019s buttocks.</p><br/><p>The Akarons would have done something.</p><br/><p>\u2018Those guys even know how to control the Gragos\u2026 Of course they know how to get rid of them.\u2019</p><br/><p>But one of the people nearby talked to Akon with a worrisome expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard\u2026 That the person who fell the Gragos was a single person. And that he is making us move because he can\u2019t deal with them all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Akon clicked his tongues.</p><br/><p>\u2018This useless kid\u2026 He believes such words.\u2019</p><br/><p>Akon pointed towards the mountains approaching them from afar.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying that a single person went inside of that, did something and the Gragos backed off? You think that makes sense?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Well, true.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man nodded.</p><br/><p>That thing was not something humans could deal with.</p><br/><p>The logic of the adventurers and the knowledge of the Akarons spread like wildfire.</p><br/><p>Suddenly there were people who started to abandon the march.</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t these guys actually just setting us up for a trap?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! You guys go ahead first then!\u201d</p><br/><p>The people who had broken off gathered with the Okonelly clan as the center.</p><br/><p>Enbi Arni looked at the scene and frowned as it even felt like a clash would happen from the Cross clan and the other adventurers.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026Well. This should be happening anyway.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was an obvious result.</p><br/><p>They had to make a decision that would impact their lives within a short amount of time with limited information.</p><br/><p>Who would want to abandon the Gragos they had been living upon and go on top of the suspicious black lion?</p><br/><p>The problem was that this may cause thousands of lives to die off.</p><br/><p>They had pulled out everyone from the corners of the Gragos.</p><br/><p>They just needed to cross to the black lion but for a problem to occur here.</p><br/><p>\u2018This won\u2019t do. Let\u2019s first kill off those guys\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t the best solution.</p><br/><p>Since there would be a lot of deaths.</p><br/><p>But Enbi Arin\u2019s method was that finishing things off fast was better rather than delaying time.</p><br/><p>While Enbi Arin poured strength upon her fists, another hand stopped her.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin looked at Hansoo, who had suddenly appeared out of nowhere, with a confused expression.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Didn\u2019t you go somewhere?\u201d</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin muttered while looking at Hansoo.</p><br/><p>This guy said that he had to do something important.</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cI did prepare something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have much talent in persuasion, I\u2019m going to make them cross forcibly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sofia asked with a nervous expression next to him.</p><br/><p>Though she had seen him do his work since the Red Zone, this guy never did things \u2018normally.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was destruction or mega destruction.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t know what kind of life he had lived but even a terrorist would be nicer than this guy.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well if the results weren\u2019t good then he would just be a terrorist.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo shrugged his shoulders while looking at Sofia\u2019s nervous expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell it\u2019ll be a bit wasteful if we don\u2019t use the things that remained.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment the bull shaped Gragos started to cry out.</p><br/><p>Guoooooooooooo!</p><br/><p>And soon the bull shaped Gragos started to tilt its body very slowly.</p><br/><p>Into a position of rolling on the lava.</p><br/><p>\u201cAaaa!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this! What\u2019s going on!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone freaked out.</p><br/><p>Since they didn\u2019t know what caused this.</p><br/><p>But Gwanje realized what caused this and made an expression of disbelief.</p><br/><p>Since he knew what Hansoo had done.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou crazy bastard! The remaining Graphite!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded as he shouted out loudly.</p><br/><p>Loud enough that everyone within the Forest of Horns could hear.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmergency! The Gragos is going to roll! Escape! We have to escape to the black lion!\u201d</p><br/><p>Boooooom!</p><br/><p>The giant voice resonated over the people who had gathered.</p><br/><p>And the people who had been in a chaotic situation realized what happened.</p><br/><p>As well as what they would need to do in order to survive.</p><br/><p>\u201cUwaaa! Damnit!\u201d</p><br/><p>The members of the Okonelly clan, Akon and everyone else who had been gathered, started to madly dash towards the black lion.</p><br/><p>And like people who had survived the Otherworld for 5 to 6 years, they were successfully escaping to the black lion despite the vibrations.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn, they\u2019re running the best.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo laughed as he looked at the Okonelly clansmen who were running towards the black lion at extreme speeds.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go over as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026You\u2019re really insane.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as the results are good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked at Gwanje who was sighing as the thought of his next goal.</p><br/><p>\u2018Go onto the Lazar and retrieve the Crown of Thorns.\u2019</p><br/><p>Elkadion\u2019s relic, Crown of Thorns.</p><br/><p>But this wasn\u2019t for him.</p><br/><p>There was something else for him.</p><br/><p>The legacy of the great patriarch, Mekido, that Elkadion had prepared.</p><br/><p>The treasure that allowed Mekido, an Akaron, to fight the Tiradus and win on a one versus one.</p><br/><p>Hansoo finished his thoughts as he moved towards Lazar.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Why?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo was confused as he stared at Enbi Arin\u2014she had woken up but was currently fighting Kiriel.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2018Ugh!\u2019</p><br/><p>Kiriel clenched her teeth as she stared at Enbi Arin, who had started attacking her the moment she woke up.</p><br/><p>\u2018Strong.\u2019</p><br/><p>They had both recently risen up to a 3-Star, so their strength levels were similar.</p><br/><p>Which meant that the only thing they could compete with was the micromanagement and control of their skills, as well as their level of mastery of those skills.</p><br/><p>Of course, Kiriel had always been confident in this field.</p><br/><p>As she climbed up, there had been countless others stronger than her, but she had never lost a fight against an opponent with the same level of strength.</p><br/><p>Her natural talent and her Psychometry, which quickly absorbed experiences, allowed her to boast a whole other level of strength.</p><br/><p>But she soon realized that she\u2019d been a bit too proud up until this point.</p><br/><p>\u2014crack!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Enbi Arin\u2019s enhanced strength and dexterity from her trait, Tainted Emotions, was pushing Kiriel back.</p><br/><p>After becoming a 3-Star Transcendent, Enbi Arin\u2019s restored and enhanced body raged on as she continuously charged at Kiriel to shred her heart apart.</p><br/><p>And the moment she saw this, Kiriel knew.</p><br/><p>As to what emotion was fueling Enbi Arin.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Rage.\u2019</p><br/><p>Rage was storming through Enbi Arin\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>To destroy everything before her eyes.</p><br/><p>Kiriel quickly shouted in surprise:</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit! I know you can hear me! I\u2019m Hansoo\u2019s comrade! We\u2019re the ones that woke you up!\u201d</p><br/><p>She was different from when the armor had controlled her.</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin had no sanity back then.</p><br/><p>But now, she was completely sane and only filled with rage.</p><br/><p>Which meant that Kiriel could communicate with her.</p><br/><p>\u201c...\u201d</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin flinched at Hansoo\u2019s name, but only for a moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cF***\u2026OFF!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Enbi Arin started to push Kiriel back again.</p><br/><p>\u2018Dammit\u2026 At this rate\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin was strong, but Kiriel had the Dragon God Armor.</p><br/><p>But as Kiriel was about to activate her armor\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014Hansoo jumped between Enbi Arin and Kiriel, and shouted:</p><br/><p>\u201cEnbi Arin! Wake up! It\u2019s alright now! It\u2019s all over!\u201d</p><br/><p>And Kiriel quickly rejoiced when she saw this.</p><br/><p>\u2018Good. She should stop since Hansoo\u2019s here.\u2019</p><br/><p>Although Enbi Arin might not believe her, she should stop once she saw Hansoo.</p><br/><p>Although his face and body had altered slightly, he was still recognizable.</p><br/><p>And Enbi Arin stopped fighting and looked at Hansoo\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>As if she doubted her own vision.</p><br/><p>\u201cKang\u2026 Hansoo?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><br/><p>But then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014boom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014an even more vicious aura exploded out from Enbi Arin\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Pure, unadulterated rage.</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin charged at Hansoo and roared at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou! This is all your fault! This! I was living just fine!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Something\u2019s weird.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo pondered as he blocked Enbi Arin\u2019s attacks.</p><br/><p>The chipset wasn\u2019t controlling her.</p><br/><p>And she was completely sane.</p><br/><p>But something was strange.</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked at Enbi Arin\u2019s shaking eyes and continued to think of a reason.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u2014boooboboboom\u2014 </p><br/><p>The Mimir\u2019s fog covered Aokan, so nothing was visible, but the sounds of battle still resonated from within.</p><br/><p>And the fleet continued to observe the city.</p><br/><p>Although they couldn\u2019t see anything, they could guess as to where the sounds originated from.</p><br/><p>\u2018What a barbaric race. They fight and fight and fight\u2026 What the hell is going on?\u2019</p><br/><p>N-Akuon, the leader of the Technorats on the Kalkuroun Fleet, made a bitter expression as he saw the person walking towards him from a distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cUhh\u2026 you survived.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018To see him again, especially in this place.\u2019</p><br/><p>N-Aroel.</p><br/><p>His old rival.</p><br/><p>N-Aroel\u2019s abilities were no less than his own, but due to his nasty personality and his lack of respect for the R-Levels above him, he\u2019d brought on a lot of hate from the ones at the top.</p><br/><p>Especially since he hated wars after being born on a warring planet.</p><br/><p>Because of this, he had been exiled to Aokan to rot for eternity, but for him to return like this\u2026 </p><br/><p>\u2018But still\u2026 to survive from that chaos.\u2019</p><br/><p>N-Aroel smiled as he approached N-Akuon and sat next to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it wasn\u2019t so bad. There\u2019s a lot I learned as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Nothing else? At least you came back in one piece.\u201d</p><br/><p>N-Akuon spoke to N-Aroel with concern.</p><br/><p>Although N-Aroel\u2019s thought processes were a bit dangerous, he wasn\u2019t that bad of a person.</p><br/><p>Plus, N-Akuon only labeled him as a rival; there was no real hatred between them.</p><br/><p>He only felt lonely after hearing that they\u2019d sent N-Aroel to Aokan, but seeing him like this wasn\u2019t half bad.</p><br/><p>N-Aroel smiled at N-Akuon\u2019s words and replied:</p><br/><p>\u201cThere were plenty of things. Fun stuff as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...Fun?\u201d</p><br/><p>N-Akuon asked curiously.</p><br/><p>The term \u2018fun\u2019 was a word that could pique anybody\u2019s interest.</p><br/><p>And N-Aroel chuckled as he nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Fun.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat was so fun about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>N-Aroel placed his head on his hand, thinking it over.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot. Too many to count, really. But three big ones. Let\u2019s see\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>N-Aroel flicked his finger after a brief pause.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. This should be first. The conversation I had with Melchizedek.\u201d</p><br/><p>N-Akuon frowned and asked:</p><br/><p>\u201cMelchizedek?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you so shocked? My position was more than enough to talk with Melchizedek.\u201d</p><br/><p>N-Akuon quickly started losing interest.</p><br/><p>\u2018...It seems that this was before the rebellion.\u2019</p><br/><p>If that was the case, then having a simple conversation wasn\u2019t hard.</p><br/><p>Aokan was under Melchizedek\u2019s control, and N-Aroel had been the city\u2019s head technician.</p><br/><p>They\u2019d probably talked like two neighbors meeting on their way to work.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. What did you guys talk about?\u201d</p><br/><p>He\u2019d long lost interest, but decided to hear him out.</p><br/><p>N-Aroel continued to smile at N-Akuon\u2019s detached tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell\u2026 it\u2019s not much. It was saying something like how Angkara shouldn\u2019t continue like this? About how everything is wrong and they shouldn\u2019t be fighting like this.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026?!\u201d</p><br/><p>N-Akuon\u2019s eyes widened at N-Aroel\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>What was this?</p><br/><p>This meant that N-Aroel had long known about Melchizedek\u2019s rebellion.</p><br/><p>\u201c...I think we need to discuss this seriously. What do you mean?\u2019</p><br/><p>N-Aroel chuckled at N-Akuon\u2019s tense stance.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems that you\u2019re finally interested again. Right, it\u2019s important to stay focused when listening to a fun story like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...If you\u2019re just fooling around, then drop it. This is not a topic we can fool around with.\u201d</p><br/><p>Considering the things Melchizedek had done, even if one was barely involved they would still be framed as a traitor.</p><br/><p>This was not a topic one could take lightly.</p><br/><p>N-Aroel ignored N-Akuon\u2019s words and continued to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust listen. Aren\u2019t you curious about what Melchizedek said?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...Sure. Fine. Speak.\u201d</p><br/><p>N-Akuon gave in to his curiosity.</p><br/><p>While consoling himself.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yeah. It\u2019s a bit too much to call the guards for a light conversation like this.\u2019</p><br/><p>If N-Aroel got caught amidst this situation because he called the guards, they might drag him off and torture him.</p><br/><p>And N-Akuon didn\u2019t feel comfortable about doing such a thing to his old friend.</p><br/><p>N-Aroel smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 Just like the past, you always cared about me. Thanks. Anyway\u2026 what Melchizedek talked about was simple. That we needed to stop the small-scale battles and unite once again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>N-Aroel smile turned cold.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe found traces of another race beneath Aokan.\u201d</p><br/><p>A very powerful race.</p><br/><p>A race that was countless times stronger than their own planet, both in terms of strength and technology, and had once roamed over the universe.</p><br/><p>According to Melchizedek\u2019s calculations, they were not something that Angkara could oppose with their divided strength.</p><br/><p>After some calculations, Melchizedek had come to the conclusion of 37 years.</p><br/><p>If they stopped their war and focused entirely on development for 37 years, only then would they be able to survive.</p><br/><p>N-Akuon scoffed at N-Aroel\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a crazy can. So what, it\u2019s going to conquer Angkara?\u201d</p><br/><p>Melchizedek\u2019s words were something every civilian in Angkara wanted.</p><br/><p>But if it could happen just because they wanted it to, they wouldn\u2019t have gone to war in the first place.</p><br/><p>There was only one scenario where there were no more disputes between the people.</p><br/><p>When everybody was dead.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell it to kill everyone off and replace them with machines? Nothing would fight each other anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>If it replaced everything with machines, it could create that united world it talked about.</p><br/><p>But N-Aroel shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cMelchizedek told me that it thought about that as well\u2026 But soon told me no. That they would only be able to wield the M-waves properly if people still lived.\u201d</p><br/><p>They needed strength to win battles.</p><br/><p>And Melchizedek had tried very hard to achieve that strength with only machines.</p><br/><p>But it was all futile.</p><br/><p>The strength of the inside Angkara that powered the Dragon God Armor and the various fleets.</p><br/><p>And the hidden ability of humans that allowed them to control that flame\u2019s power, the M-waves.</p><br/><p>The strength that the Dragon God Soldiers or fleet masters could use was not something machines could achieve.</p><br/><p>So they needed humans.</p><br/><p>N-Aroel smiled and looked at N-Akuon.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the end, it told me that it found the perfect solution.\u2019</p><br/><p>N-Akuon scoffed.</p><br/><p>\u201cChipsets? Brainwashing? It can control our bodies like that, but not our minds.\u201d</p><br/><p>The M-waves naturally declined anything that would harm one\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Even if they were brainwashed.</p><br/><p>Even if their bodies were forcefully controlled.</p><br/><p>The M-waves would resist it all.</p><br/><p>N-Aroel scoffed.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I say? It found a solution.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt told me it got a hint from someone else. Apparently, in another world\u2026 there are people that are asleep inside delightful dreams.\u201d</p><br/><p>They slept and dreamed of their ideal world.</p><br/><p>And their bodies would fall under Melchizedek\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>There was no resistance, either.</p><br/><p>Although the bodies were fighting, their true selves would be in a very happy place.</p><br/><p>\u2018Even if they release the chipset\u2019s controls...They won\u2019t be able to wake up from that dream.\u2019</p><br/><p>N-Aroel chuckled.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201c...It seems you had a very delightful dream.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018The reason why you didn\u2019t want to wake up wasn\u2019t because you didn\u2019t like reality, but because the dream was too good\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>But one couldn\u2019t live inside a dream forever.</p><br/><p>They had to wake up.</p><br/><p>No matter how happy the dreams made them.</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked at Enbi Arin with a heavy expression.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

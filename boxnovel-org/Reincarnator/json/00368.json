It seems that life is a lot more thrilling staying alongside you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo smiled at her joking words.</p><br/><p>Her energetic atmosphere was good to see.</p><br/><p>He then looked at Enbi Arin, who seemed to have more vigor on her face, and he sighed in relief.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019ve held on well.\u2019</p><br/><p>There was a sea of crystals around her now.</p><br/><p>If they picked all of them up and fed them to Enbi Arin, she would easily rise up to a 3-Star and heal.</p><br/><p>A very clean result.</p><br/><p>But there were a few things they needed to deal with.</p><br/><p>First, the Kalkuroun Fleet above them.</p><br/><p>Although the fleet couldn\u2019t do anything at this exact moment because of the Mimir, they would fire down strikes the moment they could.</p><br/><p>And second.</p><br/><p>\u2018...The thing providing Mimir with the energy.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked into the abyss where a blue light was seeping out in the distance.</p><br/><p>They had been able to transfer one Dragon God Soldier after combining the energy output from all three Fusion Reactors inside the Main Research Center.</p><br/><p>Of course, the combined output had lasted a short moment, but this proved something.</p><br/><p>That even a small-scale Quantum Transmission required enough energy to run three cities.</p><br/><p>But surprisingly, something unbelievable had occurred in Aokan.</p><br/><p>The Quantum Transmission had almost transferred hundreds of thousands of entities.</p><br/><p>Through almost a million kilometers of space.</p><br/><p>It was not something Aokan\u2019s Fusion Reactor could handle.</p><br/><p>He could clearly see the countless tubes transferring energy into the depths of the abyss.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hmm. What to do?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo pondered for a moment and then spoke to Kiriel.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it possible to read the memory of this thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>He pointed at the dead 5th-level Quirae\u2019s corpse.</p><br/><p>Kiriel quickly nodded and activated her ability on the corpse.</p><br/><p>\u2014oooooong\u2014 </p><br/><p>Her Psychometry, which had further enhanced after breaching another wall, quickly began to read through the memories.</p><br/><p>But despite her enhanced ability, Kiriel\u2019s expression didn\u2019t look very encouraging.</p><br/><p>Kiriel shook her head as she said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t much.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed that she couldn\u2019t read the memories of the entity that the Quirae had eaten\u2014she could only read the Quirae\u2019s memories from its birth.</p><br/><p>Just how it had been born in the abyss and had come down here through the abyss.</p><br/><p>Of course, she didn\u2019t return empty-handed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve at least found out where the thing this Quirae ate had come from.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiriel pointed towards the bright blue abyss in the distance.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo tightly grasped the hammer in his hand.</p><br/><p>\u2018I guess I must go down.\u2019</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d find below.</p><br/><p>Even though the Quirae had eaten it, its original strength would not be weak.</p><br/><p>But Kiriel shook her head as she looked at Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t have to fight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiriel shrugged her shoulders at Hansoo\u2019s confused expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe things those Quirae ate weren\u2019t alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Corpse after corpse after corpse.</p><br/><p>None of them had been alive.</p><br/><p>They were all dead and dried up.</p><br/><p>\u201c...I don\u2019t know what happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiriel mumbled as she thought back to the memories of that Quirae, and of the area below those depths.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2014whoooosh!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo thought back to Kiriel\u2019s last words as he dropped into the depths.</p><br/><p>She just had to collect the crystals on the ground, so it wasn\u2019t hard to do.</p><br/><p>Hansoo accepted Kiriel\u2019s suggestion. </p><br/><p>Looking at the surrounding walls, it seemed that something had dug through these depths. </p><br/><p>As he fell, he thought:</p><br/><p>\u2018...This isn\u2019t natural.\u2019</p><br/><p>An artificial hole.</p><br/><p>And it was clear who had done this.</p><br/><p>\u2018Melchizedek.\u2019</p><br/><p>Although Nelkipa boasted a powerful defense, as long as it wasn\u2019t a life-threatening attack there was no resistance.</p><br/><p>It wouldn\u2019t care much about a small hole in its skin.</p><br/><p>Although it got harder to dig through as one went deeper, digging something like this was a piece of cake for Melchizedek.</p><br/><p>\u2014whooosh!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Falling through the bright blue hole, Hansoo started to control his speed when he saw the ground quickly approaching him from beneath.</p><br/><p>\u2014kakakakaka!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo held onto a tube along the walls, causing him to quickly slow down, and then proceeded to land.</p><br/><p>As he looked up, a blinding blue light surrounded him.</p><br/><p>It was a level of brightness that could easily blind a normal human being.</p><br/><p>But of course, it wasn\u2019t enough to disrupt Hansoo\u2019s sight.</p><br/><p>\u2014squirm\u2014 </p><br/><p>His pupils altered as they quickly readjusted to the light level before his eyes.</p><br/><p>Hansoo quickly looked around, and then found the source of the light.</p><br/><p>\u2014ooooooong\u2014 </p><br/><p>A 200-meter radius or so\u2014a very tiny space.</p><br/><p>The floor of this space was made up of a transparent material.</p><br/><p>And past the transparent floor, a blue sphere pulsed as if it could explode at any moment.</p><br/><p>No, it was more like a blue sun.</p><br/><p>The giant sphere was so huge that he could clearly see its details despite the distance between them.</p><br/><p>It seemed to be right in the center of Nelkipa\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>The transparent floor absorbed the energy radiating out from the sphere and was sending it over to a crystal located in the center.</p><br/><p>And the tubes above him were connected to that crystal.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Amazing.\u2019</p><br/><p>Although the crystal wasn\u2019t directly connected to the sphere and was only absorbing the energy indirectly, it was more than enough to transfer out all the entities within Aokan.</p><br/><p>\u2014tonk\u2014tonk\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo tapped the floor and then frowned.</p><br/><p>\u2018Unbreakable.\u2019</p><br/><p>Maybe he might have been able to if he used all his strength, but the thickness and sturdiness behind it weren\u2019t so simple.</p><br/><p>And he didn\u2019t feel like he should break it anyway.</p><br/><p>The small floor beneath his feet was only a small part of a huge glass structure.</p><br/><p>Melchizedek probably hadn\u2019t broken it because it knew this as well.</p><br/><p>\u2018If it were possible, Melchizedek would\u2019ve done it a long time ago.\u2019</p><br/><p>If it had been able to directly harness the energy below the glass floor and control it, there was no reason for it to fly all the way to Angkara.</p><br/><p>Angkara would\u2019ve easily turned into a sea of flames if it just fired a strike using this energy.</p><br/><p>But this was well beyond what Melchizedek could control.</p><br/><p>Hansoo then turned away from the transparent glass sphere surrounding the miniature blue sun and looked around.</p><br/><p>And realized what Kiriel had been talking about.</p><br/><p>\u2018...They\u2019re all dead.\u2019</p><br/><p>Corpses that had been chewed apart by the Quirae\u2019s larvae.</p><br/><p>But it would have been painful.</p><br/><p>These corpses didn\u2019t seem like they had died from the Quirae.</p><br/><p>It seemed like they\u2019d been dead for a very long time.</p><br/><p>And he could see dried-up, yet familiar, sets of armor surrounding the corpses.</p><br/><p>Hundreds.</p><br/><p>\u2018The blue armor\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo was shocked as he looked at the hundreds of blue armor that had dried up from the lack of an energy supply.</p><br/><p>Melchizedek had picked one up\u2014that was fine.</p><br/><p>But then why wasn\u2019t his armor all dried up like those things and was still maintaining its functionality?</p><br/><p>At that moment\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014booooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014a loud sound occurred above the hole he\u2019d fallen down from.</p><br/><p>A sound that he could hear despite being multiple kilometers underground.</p><br/><p>\u2018What the hell is going on now?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked up.</p><br/><p>*Ekdud's Notes: The first few lines of this chapter are the

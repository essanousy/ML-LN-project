Newcomers! Let\u2019s have a talk!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Altair finched as she looked at these people approaching her with a threatening aura.</p><br/><p>Her own group only had around 9 people.</p><br/><p>But the other side had at least 20 people.</p><br/><p>And their eyes were all shining as if they were in a rush.</p><br/><p>This was very dangerous.</p><br/><p>Since the ones who didn\u2019t have any leisure to back off to might do some crazy things.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damnit. At least tell us what the vote is.\u2019</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>Hoooook!</p><br/><p>One of the guards, who was watching from above the scouting post, jumped down and landed on the ground.</p><br/><p>Tadak</p><br/><p>The sound of the landing was very quiet but effect wasn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The Farmers who were walking up suddenly flinched while looking at the Guard.</p><br/><p>Hellum, a guard who had landed, smiled and then shouted to the ones around him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know already. That violence is forbidden.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Altair sighed as she looked at the people walking off and then switched her gaze onto the guard.</p><br/><p>The person who had first guided them in the village.</p><br/><p>Altair asked Hellum.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is the vote and why is it causing such a ruckus?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hellum chuckled.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell. Putting it simply, it\u2019s like a popularity vote.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Altair spoke with a dumbfounded expression.</p><br/><p>A popularity vote was enough to cause everyone to fall in panic like this?</p><br/><p>No way.</p><br/><p>Hellum added additional details while looking at Altair.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou see, our village is in a certain situation where we need to pick out offerings. Constantly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Offering.</p><br/><p>A word that didn\u2019t have good vibes to it.</p><br/><p>Hellum continued to speak while looking at Altair.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, I don\u2019t even know what happens to those who become offerings. But it\u2019s a fact that it doesn\u2019t really sound good right? That\u2019s why everyone was trying so hard to fill their quota to not go but\u2026 This method was very vague. And to base it off strength\u2026 That\u2019s weird too right? We can\u2019t really number everyone according to strength and one\u2019s strength might differ depending on how dire of a situation they are in. And for someone to pick people off like a king\u2026 Our village is still a bit democratic you see.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Yeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is why the voting system has been introduced.\u201d</p><br/><p>Vote.</p><br/><p>The rules were simple.</p><br/><p>One vote per one person.</p><br/><p>The Farmers could give this to anybody but themselves that they judge to be needed in the village.</p><br/><p>And it was their choice whomever they gave it to.</p><br/><p>Since someone might be really needed to them despite not being needed by others.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe number changes every time but\u2026With the amount of offerings we need this time, you need at least three votes this time. This is the only reason to stay in the village. It\u2019s not that bad really. There was a time when one needed to receive five people\u2019s votes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hellum was about to continue speaking but just held it in.</p><br/><p>Since there wasn\u2019t a need to be kind to a rude girl who disregarded seniority.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s extremely disadvantageous for newcomers like you.\u2019</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t an issue of necessity but how long they had been in the village.</p><br/><p>People in the village will usually appeal themselves to the others.</p><br/><p>That they were needed in the village like this.</p><br/><p>At first they had created this method just to pick out offerings but it brought quite a positive effect to the whole community.</p><br/><p>Most people will do whatever it took to profit usually.</p><br/><p>Even if that harmed their comrades.</p><br/><p>But once the offering system was introduced, they couldn\u2019t do whatever they wanted.</p><br/><p>Since they would then become the offerings in the next voting.</p><br/><p>Nobody wanted to have somebody dangerous around them in an environment already filled to the brim with danger.</p><br/><p>Even if they were siblings.</p><br/><p>And to keep one\u2019s image as well as maintaining one\u2019s chance at the vote, the villagers were quite concerned about this issue during the normal days as well.</p><br/><p>There were indeed three days to acquire the votes but having the guaranteed votes before then was safer.</p><br/><p>Altair made a dumbfounded expression at the words of Hellum that told her that she needed to gain three votes.</p><br/><p>Then a tremendous issue would arise from this.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026Do you mean that two thirds of the village will get dragged out as offerings?\u201d</p><br/><p>It made no sense.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t know how long the offering system took place but if they cut off such a large amount of people then there was no way the village would be able to be maintained.</p><br/><p>Hellum smiled at those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell actually\u2026This is a bit different.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou Farmers only have one vote per person. But there\u2019s no rule saying that others are the same way right?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was democratic, yes.</p><br/><p>But it was only democratic .</p><br/><p>It was not like the real world.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Karhal, a Hunter who had returned to the village, whistled as he looked at Mackill who was looking at him with a despicable expression:</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. Why have you come to see me? After saying such words.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mackill clenched her teeth and spoke:</p><br/><p>\u201cYou knew that the time for the voting had come in the village.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Mackill and the other 200 people entered the village they had fallen into another dangerous situation.</p><br/><p>Since they, the ones who had been dragged away by Keron and Etianon the moment they came into the village, had no connections whatsoever.</p><br/><p>Even if they go around and vote for each other only 70 of them would be able to live.</p><br/><p>Karhal nodded at those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cI knew.\u201d</p><br/><p>The words of the leisurely Karhal.</p><br/><p>Mackill shouted out in rage from the attitude of Karhal which seemed like it was asking what the problem was.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn! Then why did you bring us into the village right away! You could\u2019ve waited until the vote ended to bring us in!\u201d</p><br/><p>The offerings vote didn\u2019t take that long.</p><br/><p>If Karhal left them in the darkness until it ended and brought them?</p><br/><p>Then they would\u2019ve been able to dodge the vote this time along.</p><br/><p>And then they would\u2019ve been able to buy some time.</p><br/><p>Until the next vote for the offerings.</p><br/><p>Karhal smirked at these words.</p><br/><p>A clear sneer.</p><br/><p>Mackill stopped at Karhal\u2019s expression.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What?\u201d</p><br/><p>Karhal laughed as he spoke.</p><br/><p>With an attitude saying that she was only this much as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying that you want to escape this vote by yourselves\u2026 What if the 200 of you miss it? Then what about the other 200 who would get dragged along instead?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAt least they had worked hard to bring in food to the village and didn\u2019t mind licking the foot of others just to collect some votes. They struggled as much as they could. And if one compares them to you\u2026 It\u2019s clear who should get dragged away right?\u201d</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t a need for Karhal to judge things anyway.</p><br/><p>Since the results of the vote would tell them.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the end well\u2026 It means you guys got this far by stepping on others.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mackill couldn\u2019t hold in her anger and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou fucking bastard! That\u2019s because we were trapped because of you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Karhal nodded as he heard the enraged shout of Mackill.</p><br/><p>While erasing the smile on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. So that\u2019s why you guys came to find us right? You want us to take responsibility?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaa\u2026Haaa.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mackill suppressed her anger at those words and then started to breathe in and out.</p><br/><p>The other side clearly knew what she wanted.</p><br/><p>It was now time to get to the main point.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. If you guys are still human\u2026At least give us the votes this time around. You guys have\u2026Ten votes each.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Hunters had two privileges.</p><br/><p>One, they were completely exempt from the vote.</p><br/><p>Second, they all had 10 votes each.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t wrong to say it was based on strength.</p><br/><p>Since a Hunter was an important figure that couldn\u2019t be traded even for 10 Farmers.</p><br/><p>This was the true privilege of Hunters who lived atop of the Farmers.</p><br/><p>To them, this whole voting this was just watching fire that was across the river.</p><br/><p>This was the reason why Mackill came to find Karhal.</p><br/><p>Karhal\u2019s team, the 30 people, had a total of 300 votes.</p><br/><p>And even more if they could ask for some people for help.</p><br/><p>Karhal chuckled at Mackill\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re asking too much. You\u2019re asking us to give you the authority to save 200 people.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mackill clenched her teeth and then spoke:</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing can be done. And you guys won\u2019t be able to ignore it as well. How would I stop the mouths of those who would get dragged away as offerings?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nobody knew what happened to those who got dragged out as offerings.</p><br/><p>But it was clear that they didn\u2019t need to deal with the hunters anymore at least.</p><br/><p>If they gather up and expose the Hunters then a calamity will befall the Hunters.</p><br/><p>Karhal pondered for a moment while looking at Mackill threatening him and then chuckled as he nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cSure. Since it wasn\u2019t only Keron and Etianon who wronged. We need to take responsibility a bit as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>As moment Mackill\u2019s expression brightened up from Karhal\u2019s answer, Karhal spoke again:</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, We cannot give you all 600 votes. We can hmm\u2026Yeah, 300. We will only give you 300.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Karhal made an expression saying \u2018Wasn\u2019t it obvious?\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. Why would the Farmers come all the way to us to lick our feet?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Hunters couldn\u2019t play with the Farmers if they weren\u2019t issued a Free Pass even if they were Hunters.</p><br/><p>But even without that, many Farmers would dodge the eyes of the guards and approach the Hunters outside the village.</p><br/><p>They would sell themselves so the Hunters could vote for them.</p><br/><p>And there was no reason the Hunters needed to deny it.</p><br/><p>Karhal continued to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are a few votes we promised to give you see. You want us to scrape everything off them and give it to you as well? This is too much. This is as much as we can give you if we use every bit of influence we have.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The words \u2018Can you not\u2019 almost came up from her throat but she gulped it back down.</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>Because then, even if they were able to dodge the vote this time around, they would get killed by their fellow Farmers.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026Where to get the remaining votes?\u2019</p><br/><p>Mackill\u2019s expression turned into that of panic slowly.</p><br/><p>Karhal chuckled as he looked at Mackill and then spoke:</p><br/><p>\u201cTry going to that Hansoo guy. Though I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re the only one who\u2019s quite urgent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Altair took her group and quickly started to go through the village.</p><br/><p>\u2018I need to hurry and find him.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo was their sole remaining hope.</p><br/><p>They had 9 people.</p><br/><p>The votes they needed was 27 in total but there was no one who would give them any votes.</p><br/><p>No one.</p><br/><p>They needed to get those 10 votes from Hansoo at least and work from there.</p><br/><p>But Altair realized that she was a step too late after having arrived.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease give me a vote! Just one! I\u2019ve already collected two!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease! I\u2019ll do whatever you ask of if you give me two! I\u2019ve collected quite a lot of runes as well! Please I beg you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s surroundings had already turned into chaos.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just one or two.</p><br/><p>Hundreds of people had gathered around him.</p><br/><p>\u2018My god\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Altair swirled her tongue around her mouth.</p><br/><p>But she knew the reason for this.</p><br/><p>There was a limited amount of Hunters in the village.</p><br/><p>And the votes of those Hunters had long been set before the vote already.</p><br/><p>The newly risen Hunter, Hansoo, was like their lifeline.</p><br/><p>Altair stopped while looking at the attitudes of the giant group of people.</p><br/><p>Though violence was forbidden, it didn\u2019t seem from their expressions that things would end calmy.</p><br/><p>Well everyone here could only be like that.</p><br/><p>Since they had all seen what the Harvester, the one called Dakidus, was chewing on as a snack.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t know what happened to the ones sent away as offerings.</p><br/><p>But if they get pushed out from here?</p><br/><p>They would get dragged away by the thing that treated humans as snacks.</p><br/><p>While everyone was shouting out loudly of the things they can offer with a panic stricken expression, one of the people who had come here looked at Altair\u2019s group and spoke.</p><br/><p>Since it had been quite long since the faces of the newcomers, the first in a while, had spread around in the village.</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t do anything because of the Guards but the man still whispered quietly to Altair.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey. Isn\u2019t it better for you to just stay out of this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man looked around his surroundings as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone here has at least gathered two votes you see. They worked hard during the normal days for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man frowned as he spoke.</p><br/><p>Since he wasn\u2019t an exemption to that.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn\u2026I thought two votes would be enough.\u2019</p><br/><p>But in a situation like this, every vote had the worth of a life.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich means that ten people wouldn\u2019t go with that guy\u2019s votes. But you guys need 3 votes each to get exempted. Logically speaking, isn\u2019t ten better than three? It\u2019s not like you die, who knows if they\u2019ll treat you well when you get there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018This monkey\u2026Saying such things\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Altair made a dumbfounded expression.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t know what would happen to the offerings but she could tell somewhat from the people\u2019s attitudes.</p><br/><p>She could not get dragged away no matter what.</p><br/><p>\u2018We\u2019re acquaintances\u2026 He wouldn\u2019t treat me like a stranger.\u2019</p><br/><p>Altair froze her expression and then walked towards Hansoo.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

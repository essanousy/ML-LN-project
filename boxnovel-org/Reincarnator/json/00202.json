Anyways, it\u2019s so hard to see his damn face.\u2019</p><br/><p>Mihee looked at Hansoo with an upset expression.</p><br/><p>She had imagined that they would always be together because they were with each other during the Tutorial.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo was busy beyond her imagination.</p><br/><p>To the point of being hard to chase him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, I didn\u2019t even think things would happen like this.\u2019</p><br/><p>Thinking of her college days of the past, she started to giggle.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo laughed while looking at Mihee.</p><br/><p>Though he had become a person who was quite unresponsive to most things while fighting in the Abyss, he was still human.</p><br/><p>Since the hard work of the Yellow Zone had been completed well, he naturally felt good.</p><br/><p>A rare smile appeared on Hansoo\u2019s usually expressionless face.</p><br/><p>\u2018It seems Karhal found his sibling.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked at Ekidu and Karhal who started to walk towards this location after controlling the people.</p><br/><p>Karhal, Ekidu and a few others were working hard to control the people of the Yellow Zone but Karhal looked as if such work was nothing and was continually smiling and laughing.</p><br/><p>To the point of making Hansoo feel content as well.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s work a bit harder. Everything\u2019s going well.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo mumbled inwardly.</p><br/><p>He just needed to continue like this.</p><br/><p>If he continued like this and there weren\u2019t any more problems from now on then humanity would gain a tremendous amount of power and wouldn\u2019t get massacred once they entered the Abyss right away like they had in the past.</p><br/><p>Which means he would be able to prevent people precious to him from dying off.</p><br/><p>And him struggling and working a bit harder to achieve this would be fine.</p><br/><p>Since he had struggled for 50 years already anyway.</p><br/><p>Compared to his friends getting killed and ripped apart next to him, this was nothing.</p><br/><p>Though bodily injuries healed, the memories inside one\u2019s head lasted.</p><br/><p>Hansoo thought up to this point and refocused.</p><br/><p>\u2018Not yet.\u2019</p><br/><p>The Smile on Hansoo\u2019s face disappeared.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t time to drop his guard yet.</p><br/><p>Though he had solved the problem, something unexpected happened.</p><br/><p>Suppress the Higher Races, who have gone berserk, one by one.</p><br/><p>A frontal clash would be hard but it wouldn\u2019t be hard to kill them off while they fought each other.</p><br/><p>Then he would receive the method of creating the Mana Pool inside the human\u2019s bodies and perform the surgery on all humans.</p><br/><p>But since the Sages had received the bodies of the Higher Races, things have become much more complex.</p><br/><p>They were smart, rational and knew how to work together.</p><br/><p>The Sages, who had been spread apart, understood the situation almost instantly even after sleeping for hundreds of years and had gathered into groups they had planned previously.</p><br/><p>The people with Rebeloong\u2019s body conversed with each other and the Arukons surveyed the surroundings.</p><br/><p>And the Akalachias stood above them all and controlled them.</p><br/><p>If they fought then it would just be a huge disaster.</p><br/><p>There were hundreds of thousands of Higher Races who could handle hundreds of humans per member.</p><br/><p>Though they would win because the ones with Body Enhancement Surgeries had come with them as well but they would still gain a huge amount of casualties.</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t raised them to lose them in a place like this.</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>A giant flag could be seen in the distance.</p><br/><p>\u2018It seems they want to speak now.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo spoke while looking at the Akalachia who was awkwardly swinging a piece of cloth tied to a huge log tens of meters long.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back. Take care of this place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 Huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even before anybody could say anything, Hansoo quickly disappeared.</p><br/><p>And the place where Hansoo left was then filled with awkwardness where people started to slowly speak one by one.</p><br/><p>Since they would be together for a while anyway.</p><br/><p>The mingling of the previous members and newcomers was important.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 Nice to meet you. I\u2019m called Ekidu. Welcome to the Yellow Zone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I\u2019m Karhal. I hope things go well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Karhal turned around and looked towards the location Hansoo had gone off to with a worried expression.</p><br/><p>The job he was assigned was actually much more important than just control.</p><br/><p>Though he was controlling them, their rage was slowly building up.</p><br/><p>Since the pain and struggle they had gone through for over a decade wouldn\u2019t easily go away.</p><br/><p>There was no way their rage would disappear just because the ones who had killed their friends and family and even themselves started to laugh and make strange noises.</p><br/><p>Though they were barely suppressing their rage, it wouldn\u2019t be weird for it to explode at any moment.</p><br/><p>\u2018Anyways, does he have no sense of fear? To jump into the enemy territory alone.\u2019</p><br/><p>He pondered if he should follow Hansoo but shook his head.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s nothing he\u2019d be able to do anyway even if the situation blew up.</p><br/><p>It was better to just stay here and do his job.</p><br/><p>Karhal clenched his hands at his powerlessness as he looked towards the Higher Race\u2019s camp Hansoo went towards.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fucking bird heads. Just try touching him.\u2019</p><br/><p>Then there wouldn\u2019t be any controlling or anything.</p><br/><p>He would just rile up the people behind him and attack first.</p><br/><p>This was why he needed to control them even more now.</p><br/><p>Before these people, who were roaring out in rage, caused something.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, at least it\u2019s much more easier now since these guys are helping us.\u2019</p><br/><p>Karhal shook his head and then spoke towards the woman who had introduced herself as Mihee.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt least your side is better than us right? You should\u2019ve prepared a bit before coming up.\u201d</p><br/><p>But Mihee shook her head at those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s much difference for us either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe just have hundreds of thousands of people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018And the power that suppressed them is now gone.\u2019</p><br/><p>Karhal nervously looked at the countless newcomers behind Mihee at those words.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>Hansoo flew in from afar and landed in front of the Akalachias.</p><br/><p>Kel-Durin, the acting leader of the Sages, spoke towards Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreetings. To make things easier we shall call you humans as you have told us. Are you the king of those humans?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t really have such a system.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell. After hearing your story, those things weren\u2019t something a king would do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kel-Durin, who had been busily gathering information, nodded.</p><br/><p>A king reigned from the back and stood above the others.</p><br/><p>But the man in front of his eyes was acting at the exact opposite location of where a king should be.</p><br/><p>He fought at the frontmost locations, the roughest and the lowest places.</p><br/><p>The most vicious and dangerous places.</p><br/><p>There was a reason why this man was worthy of his respect.</p><br/><p>\u2018If it were the days back when we were Sages then I would\u2019ve used him very well.\u2019</p><br/><p>Kel-Durin looked at the human in front of him with a regrettable expression.</p><br/><p>A good king was important during times of peace but during times of war, the most important things were good generals and soldiers.</p><br/><p>And the man in front of his eyes had more than enough qualifications.</p><br/><p>If he had been born as a Sage, no even if he wasn\u2019t a sage, he would\u2019ve risen to the highest point.</p><br/><p>Up to the position of the Great General who stood next to the king.</p><br/><p>Hansoo ignored the Sage\u2019s words and then spoke expressionlessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get to the main point. Let\u2019s talk about what we shall do from now on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Yes, the introductions were a bit too long. Let\u2019s get to the point indeed. The thing you want from us the Mana Pool Surgery right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded at those words.</p><br/><p>Since it was the final objective he needed to accomplish in this world.</p><br/><p>Something that allowed them to use mana non-stop like monsters all day.</p><br/><p>Mana pool.</p><br/><p>Once it was planted inside the human\u2019s bodies, then they would be able to have a much larger amount of mana and gain the upper hand.</p><br/><p>It was a bit too much to have as much mana as a Satellite Fortress but they would be able to utilize a much larger amount of mana, at least a few times more.</p><br/><p>Kel-Durin shrugged his shoulders at Hansoo\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot hard. There\u2019s actually a system to plant the Mana Pool inside the body on every Satellite Fortress. Though there\u2019s a lot of you\u2026About three of them would be able to change your entire race. It would be even faster if we don\u2019t use the Satellite Fortresses for anything else.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo made a surprised expression.</p><br/><p>Because it was faster than he had expected.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems it\u2019s quite simple.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because we invested a lot of time and resources in order to shorten the surgery time after we invented it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo then spoke the next thing on his mind while staring at Kel-Durin.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you want from now on?\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no way he would say such things with no reason.</p><br/><p>He was doing his because there was something he wanted.</p><br/><p>Kel-Durin smiled towards Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something you must do for our plan. If you do this for us then we will provide you with the Satellite Fortresses and even tell you the Mana Pool Surgery method. If you accept our offer then we would become allies, though temporary.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded and stared at Kel-Durin.</p><br/><p>Telling him to hurry and speak.</p><br/><p>But the thing that came out of Kel-Durin\u2019s mouth was not something Hansoo had to do but more information.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me say something before that. You need to hear this if you want to gain the Mana Pool. Why we tried to gain stronger bodies.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t it because you just needed stronger bodies?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kel-Durin scoffed and then pointed towards the fallen Satellite Fortresses.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith something like that? You think we\u2019d need powerful bodies?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStrength was just a byproduct, we just made it well since we were going to anyway.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded.</p><br/><p>A short thought was all he needed.</p><br/><p>A powerful body was not something necessary to them.</p><br/><p>Even more so not a reason for them to all go into cryo-sleep at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u2018It shouldn\u2019t be something like a contagious disease or anything.\u2019</p><br/><p>Kel-Durin spoke towards Hansoo.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

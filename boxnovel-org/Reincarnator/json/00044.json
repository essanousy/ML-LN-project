Congratulations on clearing a room. Heehee. It was decent enough for 10 people to clear right?\u201d.</p><br/><p>Everyone unconsciously nodded at these words.</p><br/><p>It took about a day for them to get through one room.</p><br/><p>And runes had come out too.</p><br/><p>The fairy spoke as it looked at these people.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell it\u2019s exactly at the difficulty for 10 people. But isn\u2019t the reward a bit too lacking for a day\u2019s worth of work?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everybody flinched.</p><br/><p>\u2018Looking at it again\u2026.\u2019</p><br/><p>They had ignored it because they were hunting the beasts whilst being on guard with the nearby people but it seems like the beasts they had killed had not dropped a single artifact.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is a bit troublesome.\u2019</p><br/><p>Artifacts and skills were important beyond anything else.</p><br/><p>Runes did not create a substantial gap and even if there was a gap it was still possible to catch up to it.</p><br/><p>But a good artifact or a skill was different.</p><br/><p>Chulman had an incident where he collided against somebody of similar skill level as him.</p><br/><p>A guy who tried to rape a woman.</p><br/><p>Thoughts of his daughter enraged him and made him collide against him.</p><br/><p>Of course he had calculated that the guy would realize their skill levels and then refrain from colliding against each other.</p><br/><p>But this was a misconception.</p><br/><p>They were at similar levels in terms of strength but a huge difference was made at a decisive moment due to their artifacts.</p><br/><p>He had almost died because his sword had broken apart after colliding against that guy\u2019s sword a few times.</p><br/><p>If you take into account the fact that the difficulty of the Tower would continue to increase then the level of one\u2019s artifacts could not stay stationary.</p><br/><p>The fairy smiled while looking at the people trapped in their thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome on everybody. We aren\u2019t that heartless. We\u2019ve prepared it right here! Since it has taken around one day the rewards should be around this much right?\u201d</p><br/><p>The fairy pointed towards the entrance.</p><br/><p>The people who saw this stopped for a moment.</p><br/><p>Artifacts were placed in front of the 10 doors.</p><br/><p>Artifacts that were listed under the 10 Man Room on the map.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Chulman asked the fairy:</p><br/><p>\u201cDo we just need to take one of them then?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ten people. Ten doors. 10 variety of artifacts.</p><br/><p>It was quite an obvious choice.</p><br/><p>The fairy grinned at these words.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could that be. Only one out of those 10 doors will open.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026One? Then ten people would go through one door but only one artifact will be given?\u201d</p><br/><p>The fairy smiled as it spoke again.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould you first check the standards of those artifacts?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone pulled out their maps as they started to check the options of the artifacts.</p><br/><p>And then flinched.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026 Why is there so much difference?\u2019</p><br/><p>, which was in front of the door which said was pretty good but it was something one could achieve by working just a bit harder.</p><br/><p>And 10 of them existed too.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, the single which was in front of the room with or two of in front of the room with were at a level which couldn\u2019t even be compared to something like Haul\u2019s glove.</p><br/><p>An overwhelming difference in power.</p><br/><p>The fairy laughed as it saw this.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe figure listed in front of the door isn\u2019t a number. It is something that tells you about how many could survive. The number of people leaving this room alive hangs on your decisions. Heehee.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not bad to choose the 10th door and leave together in a nice manner with Haul\u2019s Gloves. Though I wouldn\u2019t recommend it due to the structure of the tower.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just a problem of this moment.</p><br/><p>He would just be dead meat if he was to take the Haul\u2019s glove and was to face a crossroad of choice like this and meet somebody who had killed off the other nine and had gotten something like the hook.</p><br/><p>Chulman cursed out loud as he gripped the sword in his hands.</p><br/><p>The moment they started to move away from each other Suhan shouted out.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait! Come to your senses! Isn\u2019t it a safer choice to get through the next level together as ten!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone flinched at these words.</p><br/><p>Of course it was logically better to have nine comrades than a single weapon like that.</p><br/><p>And even more so if you take into account that you were the one who might die during the fight.</p><br/><p>The fairy smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Heehee. Is it okay for you guys to be at such a leisure when this is just a start? After this room\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Suhan aggressively glared at the fairy as he shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone flinched as they got away from Suhan.</p><br/><p>\u2018That guy. What are his thoughts. To go up against the fairy\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Chulman looked at Suhan with a worrying expression.</p><br/><p>He felt bad for him because though guy\u2019s personality was pretty good, he was about to get killed by the fairy.</p><br/><p>But the fairy didn\u2019t act out and instead made an amused expression as it spoke:</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat an aggressive man. Can I really not speak about it then?\u201d</p><br/><p>But then a man in the corner spoke out.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. Please continue. I must hear this out.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man looked at Suhan as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou shut up instead. Shouldn\u2019t we at least hear what is about to come. If you aren\u2019t going to take care of all our lives then don\u2019t cut off important intel. Do you want to die or something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 This bitch.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suhan glared at the man but he could not swing his sword.</p><br/><p>Because that guy was one of the three strongest along with Suhan.</p><br/><p>If they fight here then they would be helping them to choose the eighth room.</p><br/><p>The fairy continued to talk.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt might not be bad to go along with ten people but you will cross against the people of other rooms. Though the number of people you would get tangled up with depends on the room.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone became serious at these words.</p><br/><p>If they choose Haul\u2019s glove then all ten of them could survive.</p><br/><p>But going together at this moment did not guarantee them going together next round.</p><br/><p>\u2018No. It\u2019ll be good if we don\u2019t become enemies then.\u2019</p><br/><p>This was proven by previous experiences.</p><br/><p>And what if the people they meet in the next room had also been in a 10 Man Room but chose the 3rd or 4th door?</p><br/><p>What if they were from a 40 Man Room and had chosen the 10th door?</p><br/><p>If you start at similar starting points then the level of artifacts was the most important part.</p><br/><p>If they head off like this then they have to go against people who are armed with much more powerful artifacts.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s expressions turned cold.</p><br/><p>A definite decision to increase their chance of survival in this damnable structure.</p><br/><p>Keep on choosing the low-numbered door and arm themselves.</p><br/><p>It might be hard in the beginning but once they grasp the advantage the gap will continue to increase.</p><br/><p>But even though everyone had such thoughts they couldn\u2019t move thoughtlessly.</p><br/><p>Since there was no guarantee that they would be part of the winning side even if they felt greedy.</p><br/><p>Suhan spoke cautiously whilst looking at everyone:</p><br/><p>\u201cWait! If we fight here then we might receive injuries and get hurt! If we go into the next room in such a situation then it\u2019ll still be dangerous! It\u2019s just better to go as ten\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. All your injuries would get healed as soon as you go through the door. We should at least give that much as service when you fought so hard to take over. Heehee. Having a limb cut off is okay too so fight well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis damnable\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>While Suhan was flustered from the fairy\u2019s words, Youngjae looked at Suhan for a moment and then smirked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you trying so hard to survive all together. Quite a funny guy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Youngjae\u2019s words ended, a woman started to walk towards Youngjae\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>Suhan narrows his eyes.</p><br/><p>Mijee.</p><br/><p>One of the three strongest along with Youngjae.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just like the idea on this side. Let\u2019s do it simply. Those who want to be with us stick here. We can organize it roughly. Even if it isn\u2019t the 1st or 2nd room hmm\u2026 4? 5th room sounds good?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Damnit\u2026 it seemed like they were talking quite a bit on the way here\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Chulman grinded his teeth as he looked at Youngjae and Mijee.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t predict things up to this point but had shared some part of their thoughts.</p><br/><p>Suhan grinded his teeth and shouted at the scene in front of him:</p><br/><p>\u201cYou crazy bastards! Why are you doing this when we can end it without fighting\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Youngjae laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe could end it without fighting. But it seems like if we were to do so here then we would get eaten by those who had fought and won. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve had to go through.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>While Suhan grinded his teeth, Youngjae clicked his tongue inwardly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to take all day.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as his words ended, Youngjae rushed out and swung his sword around him.</p><br/><p>Kwadududk.</p><br/><p>Ududuk.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chulman, who had been off guard, had his wrist cut off.</p><br/><p>He had tried to dodge backwards because he wasn\u2019t that dull but his wrist had flown off because there was a bit too much difference from the start.</p><br/><p>Everyone who had seen this started to crazily head behind Suhan.</p><br/><p>They had all realized.</p><br/><p>That they would all die if this was to continue.</p><br/><p>That guy was a maniac.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastard!\u201d</p><br/><p>The opponent was two.</p><br/><p>But it was two of the three strongest people here.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn\u2026 and that guy was hiding his true strength.\u2019</p><br/><p>Chulman grinded his teeth as he looked at Youngjae.</p><br/><p>He had known that he was strong but for him to be this strong.</p><br/><p>One could see how much muscle they had by looking but there was no way to find out about the number of runes they had before they get into a full head on clash.</p><br/><p>If one were to hide their skills like that then there was no way to know.</p><br/><p>They would not be an opponent if they didn\u2019t group up with Suhan as the center.</p><br/><p>Youngjae smirked as he saw this.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn. It\u2019s the opposite effect. I had done it to get you guys to this side. Then there\u2019s only two people along with this lady?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a very disadvantageous situation from one point of view but Youngjae didn\u2019t show it as he charged towards Suhan.</p><br/><p>And a sword fight had occurred after the other people had also charged in.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis bitch! Die.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou fucker! Getting blinded by the artifact!\u201d</p><br/><p>Youngjae and Mijee were strong but Suhan was not a pushover either and they also had an advantage in numbers.</p><br/><p>And everyone, excluding Chulman who was rendered unable to fight, started to send off a bloodthirsty aura from all around.</p><br/><p>No. There was still another person who was not involved in the sword fight.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey Minhee\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cU\u2026uuu\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>The child who had barely held a sword up against the beasts was scared out of her wits and could not get near as the people started to clash with each other.</p><br/><p>Chulman who had been clutching onto his wrist looked at her with a sad expression.</p><br/><p>Words of her having to help out had came up to his throat.</p><br/><p>But he couldn\u2019t say so after seeing a child who was so scared.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn\u2026Youngjae this bastard\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Chulman tried to heal his wrist with all his strength but it seemed like he won\u2019t be able to for a while because the ligaments in both of his hands had been cut off.</p><br/><p>And soon after the fight had ended.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuuu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuuk\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The result was that Youngjae and Mijee had won.</p><br/><p>The skills which Youngjae had hidden was really much higher than the norm.</p><br/><p>They had both become bloody but the others could not even stand and were all rolling about the floor with painful expressions.</p><br/><p>Mijee grinned as she looked at that Youngjae.</p><br/><p>\u201cHoo\u2026 you fight well. But why didn\u2019t you try to kill any of them? Is there a reason?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone had fallen to the ground but none had died.</p><br/><p>Of course they had their wrists cut off and had suffered extreme injuries so they were unable to fight but they were still alive.</p><br/><p>Youngjae laughed as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a reason for this. Anyhow\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment Youngjae\u2019s expression froze frightfully.</p><br/><p>And then he pushed Mijee away.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>And in the spot where Mijee had fallen from, a sword had flown past it with extreme speed.</p><br/><p>And the sword continued to swing as it stabbed Youngjae.</p><br/><p>Mijee was able to dodge barely but still had a deep wound on her shoulder and Youngjae\u2019s abdomen was punctured from that.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuuuk\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Youngjae mumbled at the handle of the sword which had gone through him.</p><br/><p>A speed which was not even comparable to the fight before.</p><br/><p>Youngjae coughed out some blood as he looked at Minhee who had thrown the sword.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 your skills\u2026 why did you stand still if you were this good?\u201d</p><br/><p>Minhee laughed coldly as she answered:</p><br/><p>\u201cNo reason for me to act out when you are doing the work I was going to do for me. It\u2019s a first meeting somebody crazier than me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Minhee laughed as she sent Wongyung a message.</p><br/><p>She had been looking for a chance but it was quite burdensome because the three were quite strong.</p><br/><p>And this was why she was going to look out for chances for a while.</p><br/><p>In order to aim for their backs when an even more dangerous situation occurred.</p><br/><p>The fairy had set it up but she had clicked her tongue and given up.</p><br/><p>Because it didn\u2019t seem like a fight would happen.</p><br/><p>But then that Youngjae guy started to fight with them.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ve blown my nose without even touching it.\u2019 (*Note: Korean saying meaning \u201cSomething was done without me having to do anything\u201d)</p><br/><p>This was why greedy people were good.</p><br/><p>It was hard to go against ten people even for them.</p><br/><p>But there was a reason why they had gone in one to two at a time.</p><br/><p>Since there was no need for them to fight them all alone.</p><br/><p>Things became really easy if one or two people like him existed.</p><br/><p>While Minhee was laughing quietly, Youngjae mumbled coldly in front of Minhee.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys really have too much patience. For you guys to come out only when I do this.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had always felt it but the problem with these guys was the fact that they had too much patience.</p><br/><p>That was why they would only come out when one had set up everything.</p><br/><p>It was going to be even more dangerous from now on, it\u2019ll be troublesome if he proceeded without taking care of such things.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tsk. Though it\u2019ll heal\u2026 it hurts like hell.\u2019</p><br/><p>As soon as the room opened everybody would get healed.</p><br/><p>Of course there\u2019s nothing they could do about the ones who were dead.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even before Minhee could react, a dagger which had come out from around the thigh pierced Minhee\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s the second floor now. Let\u2019s see each other soon.\u2019</p><br/><p>He would just kill off small fry like these on the way.</p><br/><p>The real goal is the guy whom he would meet on the third floor.</p><br/><p>Hansoo laughed coldly as he thought of the that would happen in the next room.</p><br/><p>Proofreader\u2019s note</p><br/><p>The true MVP of this chapter is Suhan, not Hansoo.</p><br/><p>Also, we realized that Dark Mage Lord should be translated as Dark Mad Lord and is the same Light Monarch mentioned by Keldian in chapter 1. (Light and Mad are written the same in Korean). The chapters have been edited to reflect the change.</p><br/><p>As usual, the next regular chapter of the week is coming on Friday, and the one after that on Saturday or Sunday.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

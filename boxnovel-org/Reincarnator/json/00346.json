I guess finding a 1-Star is quite easy.\u2019</p><br/><p>Only twenty 1-Star transcendents had been found after combing the entire zone below, but here they were found with alarming ease.</p><br/><p>At least twenty in this floor alone\u2026</p><br/><p>Thankfully, every single one of these things were only at the 1-Star level, but it still wasn\u2019t a situation where they could relax.</p><br/><p>Since more of them might be made after this.</p><br/><p>And there was the issue of the environment as well.</p><br/><p>The enemy forces held the absolute advantage in this environment.</p><br/><p>They were all resistant to the flames falling down from the skies.</p><br/><p>She and Hansoo had to dodge those attacks while they fought\u2014it was not a favorable situation at all.</p><br/><p>Normally, she could\u2019ve easily crushed them, but instead she\u2019d almost died in that last battle.</p><br/><p>In addition, their foes had thousands of foot soldiers.</p><br/><p>And despite being foot soldiers, they were also protected by the repulsion coating. This meant that the soldiers could freely attack them from behind while they were focused on fighting the artificial transcendents.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is suicidal.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014 </p><br/><p>Kiriel mumbled as she watched the countless pillars of flames descending all around her.</p><br/><p>After using his trait to read her emotions, Jack asked carefully:</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it better to go up? Do we have to stay and\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Just die like that?\u2019</p><br/><p>Jack looked towards Hansoo.</p><br/><p>Why would someone charge into the factory where these monstrous robots were being made?</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just go up\u2026 Wouldn\u2019t the 6th zone be better?\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, they didn\u2019t know what the 6th zone was like.</p><br/><p>But would it be any worse than this place?</p><br/><p>They could just fill up the runes on the way up.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s not like those guys are lacking in crystals anyway.\u2019</p><br/><p>Jack mumbled to himself as he glanced at Kiriel and Hansoo.</p><br/><p>That would be perfect.</p><br/><p>But\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo didn\u2019t give Jack the answer he wanted.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn it. If he was a girl, I could have charmed him away.\u2019</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t want to deal with a male, nor did he feel like it would work.</p><br/><p>Jack looked at Hansoo, who seemed to be lost in thought after hearing his words, and continued to speak.</p><br/><p>He wanted to get out of this hell as fast as possible.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like there\u2019s anyone to help you, right? The other transcendents have already gone up\u2026 and it\u2019s not like us ordinary people could help out. Are you planning to charge into the research center with just the two of you?\u201d</p><br/><p>But Hansoo smiled at these words.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? There are people who are willing to help.\u201d</p><br/><p>The expressions on Jack and the others turned grim.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Us? F***.\u201d</p><br/><p>Why were they trying to swing at a dragon\u2019s scales with a butcher knife meant for killing chickens?</p><br/><p>Maybe they might have been able to do something if flames weren\u2019t raining down their heads, but they were barely holding onto their own lives.</p><br/><p>To charge into a whole factory swarming with these things?</p><br/><p>Insane.</p><br/><p>Hansoo chuckled.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not asking you to fight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen who?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiriel asked Hansoo as she was also curious.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t know if there was anybody else of use around.</p><br/><p>\u2018...For real, though. We\u2019re the only two around.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know someone that Melchizedek would hate even more than me.\u201d</p><br/><p>And Jack cursed at these words.</p><br/><p>\u2018F***\u2026 Who the hell is this bastard?\u2019</p><br/><p>He knew as well.</p><br/><p>There was a reason why he hadn\u2019t mentioned them.</p><br/><p>This \u2018Hansoo\u2019 guy seemed like he\u2019d charge straight into the factory as soon as his chances of winning rose by even a single percent.</p><br/><p>If he really did just come up, then he shouldn\u2019t be able to know, but\u2026</p><br/><p>Jack\u2019s expression turned grim at Hansoo\u2019s next words.</p><br/><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t the people protecting Melchizedek\u2019s masters\u2026be quite angry right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>The ones who had brought Melchizedek to Nelkipa, but had lost their power due to Melchizedek\u2019s revolt.</p><br/><p>\u2018And we have a guide to take us there as well.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo smiled as he looked at Jack, whose expression had darkened at the mention of the inhabitants from .</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you being like this?

That feels disgusting! Stop!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jack shouted in anger as he backed away.</p><br/><p>He wouldn\u2019t be able to move once she surrounded him with her ability.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn\u2026 I\u2019m going to die anyway!\u2019</p><br/><p>His opponent was indeed strong, too strong for him to argue against, but he was being backed into a corner.</p><br/><p>If they read his memories and dragged him into being a guide, he would have to crawl into that hellhole.</p><br/><p>\u2018And\u2026 who knows?\u2019</p><br/><p>Jack looked at Kiriel with hope.</p><br/><p>Previously, she\u2019d stopped using her ability when he protested from embarassment.</p><br/><p>Which meant that she wasn\u2019t unreasonable.</p><br/><p>And unlike men, women usually treated him better.</p><br/><p>Kiriel might even stop that crazy Hansoo as well.</p><br/><p>But sadly\u2026 </p><br/><p>\u2014smack!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Instead of eyes filled with pity, a slap came at him instead.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhuk\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think we\u2019re playing around here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiriel eyed him coldly as she gripped his neck.</p><br/><p>Of course, they could just go up if they wanted.</p><br/><p>But then those who would die after they left would number in the tens of millions.</p><br/><p>Whether Melchizedek won.</p><br/><p>Or Clementine won.</p><br/><p>Or even if the inhabitants of Angkara won.</p><br/><p>The only thing waiting for the ones coming up after them was destruction.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo was trying to stop that from happening with his own body.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you think just looking a little pretty is everything?\u2019</p><br/><p>She\u2019d been so shocked to see Hansoo\u2019s body melting amidst his battles.</p><br/><p>It meant that this was dangerous, even for Hansoo.</p><br/><p>But he was still willing to go.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yeah... \u2018</p><br/><p>Kiriel blushed as she glanced at Hansoo and then tightened her grip on Jack\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>\u201cUghhh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jack let out a groan of pain as his body rose up into the sky.</p><br/><p>It was a scene that defied gravity, but nobody thought it was weird.</p><br/><p>Since they realized something they\u2019d forgotten about until now.</p><br/><p>This beautiful girl in front of them.</p><br/><p>And the difference in strength between them.</p><br/><p>\u2014kiiiririring\u2014 </p><br/><p>Kiriel started to read the memories within Jack\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>And Kiriel scoffed at these scenes.</p><br/><p>\u2018He lives up to his face, alright.\u2019</p><br/><p>Girl after girl.</p><br/><p>There was not a single moment where he wasn\u2019t with a girl.</p><br/><p>A different one in the morning, in the afternoon, and at night.</p><br/><p>Sometimes even two.</p><br/><p>Sometimes even more.</p><br/><p>If this guy had spent those times fighting and hunting, he would\u2019ve long become a transcendent.</p><br/><p>\u2018Both this guy\u2026 and those girls.\u2019</p><br/><p>Kiriel decided to leave his personal life alone and began to rewind through them at a faster speed.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014poof\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u201cHa\u2026haaa.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiriel released Jack, who gasped for breath, and turned around.</p><br/><p>\u201cFound it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiriel smiled at Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014 </p><br/><p>The spikes rising up from Nelkipa\u2019s body reached high into the sky.</p><br/><p>Below the giant Nelkipa\u2019s structure that the inhabitants of Angkara had named the \u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014some sort of translucent object was squirming around.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>An attack from Angkara smashed into the space right above the squirming object.</p><br/><p>\u2014chiizzt\u2014 </p><br/><p>The squirming object disappeared with a small sound, and something appeared below it.</p><br/><p>A giant armored vehicle that was at least 200 meters large.</p><br/><p>And from inside the strange-looking vehicle\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014the voices from hundreds of people could heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cPhew\u2026 If it weren\u2019t for the repulsion coating, that photon strike would\u2019ve turned us into powder.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs the shield working well?\u201d</p><br/><p>From those words\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014chijiiiiiik\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014one of them nodded as they pointed towards the squirming translucent barrier.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no issues!

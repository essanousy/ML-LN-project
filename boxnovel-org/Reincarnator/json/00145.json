To die like this in a place such as this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The Dark Cloud race member, which spat out a string of curses with its last bit of remaining strength, got pulled out whole and then disappeared.</p><br/><p>Charurururuk!!!!!</p><br/><p>As the Crown of Thorns got pulled out, the Dragon Essence Blade implanted inside Taruhol\u2019s body started to make noises as it started to come out of the body.</p><br/><p>It couldn\u2019t stay inside since there wasn\u2019t any consciousness to sustain it any longer.</p><br/><p>Hansoo pulled out the handle of the Dragon Essence Blade that stuck out from Taruhol\u2019s stomach.</p><br/><p>An artifact of the Dragon Essence Blade\u2019s level would only harm Taruhol in his current situation anyway.</p><br/><p>Since he would have no way of dealing with the overflowing energy.</p><br/><p>Soon Elkadion\u2019s soul, Galkima\u2019s soul and the Dragon Essence Blade were pulled out.</p><br/><p>The only remaining thing was Taruhol\u2019s body which had a fragment of Hansoo\u2019s soul.</p><br/><p>\u2018First the detoxification.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo carefully poured in the cure to counteract the toxin in Taruhol\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>The toxins that were destroying Taruhol\u2019s body slowly got neutralized and soon the black liquids that were constantly taking over the silver liquids slowed their invasion.</p><br/><p>But Taruhol would die if he was left like this.</p><br/><p>Since most of the silver liquids that would heal his body has been destroyed by the toxin.</p><br/><p>That was why Hansoo needed to help him.</p><br/><p>\u2018How could I leave him to die\u2026When he trusted in me and followed me?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo started to move his soul fragment inside Taruhol\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>And then Taruhol\u2019s body started to move according to Hansoo\u2019s will.</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s skill, which was implanted within the soul fragment, started to activate.</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s signature reinforcement appeared on Taruhol\u2019s body and started to quickly heal up the body.</p><br/><p>Kururururu</p><br/><p>The Demonic Dragon\u2019s Reinforcement helped the recovery of the silvery liquid and that silvery liquid helped the healing process of the body.</p><br/><p>The two worked hand in hand as the blackened body of Taruhol started to regain its color.</p><br/><p>\u2018Good. This should be enough\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked at the Crown of Thorns he was holding in his hands.</p><br/><p>The Crown of Thorns which still had Elkadion\u2019s soul in it.</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know if I can heal her.\u2019</p><br/><p>If everything goes according to his plan then she might be able to live.</p><br/><p>But the chances were half and half.</p><br/><p>\u2018Since you trusted in me and helped me\u2026 I should do my best to help you as well.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo quickly moved towards the location where Gwanje had fallen, the place where the suppressive measure was prepared.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cUghhh\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gwanje slowly opened his eyes.</p><br/><p>And then looked over his body with an expression of disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m not dead?\u2019</p><br/><p>He had clearly beaten down the golden Akadus and then collapsed.</p><br/><p>Feeling the silver liquid burning up his entire body.</p><br/><p>But he was alive.</p><br/><p>The silver liquid which had been acting as if it would explode and was burning up his entire body was surprisingly being controlled by something and had calmed down.</p><br/><p>His body had turned into a mess but it was slowly being healed from the silver liquid\u2019s power.</p><br/><p>\u2018Who can control the silver liquid to this extent?\u2019</p><br/><p>As Gwanje was confused.</p><br/><p>A sudden voice was heard in his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gwanje frowned at the sudden voice which could be heard in his head.</p><br/><p>Since it wasn\u2019t somebody whom he had good feelings towards.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why is this Elkadion in my body\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Gwanje tried closing and opening his hands just in case he would get control of his body taken over as well.</p><br/><p>While he was moving his body he moved his hands towards his head after feeling something strange upon it.</p><br/><p>The Crown of Thorns could clearly be felt on his head.</p><br/><p>Gwanje looked at Hansoo in front of his eyes and frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you plant this on me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded at those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cElkadion\u2019s soul is preventing the silver liquid from burning up. You would probably have to live your entire life like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>It would be impossible for Gwanje to control the silver liquid by himself.</p><br/><p>But Elkadion\u2019s soul, which had invented the Body Enhancement Surgery, could do so easily.</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded as he looked at Gwanje who had woken up.</p><br/><p>\u2018It was successful huh.\u2019</p><br/><p>The chances were half and half.</p><br/><p>Since he didn\u2019t know if Gwanje could handle the Crown of Thorns as well as not knowing how much Elkadion was capable of.</p><br/><p>But since Gwanje had woken up and was in command, it seemed like everything worked out well.</p><br/><p>Gwanje, who had been frowning from the fact that Elkadion was in his head, just sighed instead.</p><br/><p>Since it really wasn\u2019t his place to curse Elkadion.</p><br/><p>And the fact that he was alive when he thought that he had died was to be grateful for as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cPhew\u2026 I have no idea how the situation is. Did you deal with that monster?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded and then handed something over to Gwanje who had woken up.</p><br/><p>Gwanje frowned as he looked at it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called a soul fragment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo then started to explain what it was.</p><br/><p>Gwanje, who controlled a large clan himself, instantly understood Hansoo\u2019s explanation.</p><br/><p>Gwanje, who had been making an uncomfortable expression, asked just in case.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there a way for me to not receive this? Can\u2019t you trust me man?\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course the fact that somebody would be able to control him and read his memories could not feel good.</p><br/><p>Hansoo shook his head at the words with had a slight amount of humor within it.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it cannot be done.\u201d</p><br/><p>He could not allow a single chance of mistake, nor a single possibility of failure.</p><br/><p>Though he approved of Gwanje\u2019s abilities, there was a fatal weakness to Gwanje.</p><br/><p>His wife.</p><br/><p>And because of this he really needed to implant the soul fragment.</p><br/><p>Since he needed to stop Gwanje from going crazy and going on a rampage.</p><br/><p>Gwanje pondered for a moment at Hansoo\u2019s firm attitude and then just nodded.</p><br/><p>Since there wasn\u2019t really another way.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take it then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018If Hansoo was thinking of doing something weird then\u2026 He would\u2019ve worn the Crown of Thorns himself.\u2019</p><br/><p>Gwanje still didn\u2019t know a lot of things about Hansoo.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo wasn\u2019t a person who explained everything kindly.</p><br/><p>But there wasn\u2019t a need to explain anymore</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ll follow the path you take from now on.\u2019</p><br/><p>And the Crown of Thorns was actually very good for him.</p><br/><p>Since there was no need for him to be afraid of the Akarons anymore and create suppressive measures for them.</p><br/><p>Gwanje suddenly thought of Elkadion after thinking to this point.</p><br/><p>\u2018Are you fine with this? With all that\u2019s going on?\u2019</p><br/><p>Elkadion replied at those words.</p><br/><p>In a depressed tone.</p><br/><p>But the knowledge that she hadn\u2019t been able to hand over yet was too precious for her to leave like this.</p><br/><p>Hansoo and Gwanje would be able to control her well.</p><br/><p>And now she was willing to stay in the darkness and help the humans to improve.</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked at the new king of the Orange Zone, Elkadion and Gwanje, as he nodded.</p><br/><p>\u2018Though it\u2019s a bit different from my original plan\u2026 Everything went according to the plan.\u2019</p><br/><p>He had pulled out the soul fragment from Taruhol and put it into Gwanje.</p><br/><p>The work here was done as well.</p><br/><p>Now only the final part was left.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome out. I\u2019ll receive that reward now.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Hansoo spoke out the space split apart as something came out.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done well. Heheh. I\u2019ve been watching from a while back and\u2026 I heard Elkadion making quite a remarkable statement.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018As I expected, they were watching.\u2019</p><br/><p>As Hansoo and Gwanje looked at the Fairy, it spoke out.</p><br/><p>\u201cTen thousand spears or one treasured sword. Will you receive the rewards together since you all worked together? Or will you eat it up all by yourself?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo frowned as he looked at the fairy.</p><br/><p>\u2018To play such a trick.\u2019</p><br/><p>It probably didn\u2019t tell the others about the reward and had only told him.</p><br/><p>Since he wouldn\u2019t even be able to choose the option of taking everything by himself if the others knew about the reward.</p><br/><p>Receiving something while not expecting it and expecting it and not receiving it were completely different.</p><br/><p>And he had made his choice already anyway.</p><br/><p>\u2018I can\u2019t let the people go empty-handed when they have come to help.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo answered the question almost instantly.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn\u2026 Did it finally end? Phew.\u201d</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin sighed in relief as she looked at the Akadus which were suddenly rolling around the ground.</p><br/><p>Since though she had destroyed 2 golden Akadus, she herself had become a mess.</p><br/><p>And as the battle ended, there were people who slowly crept towards them.</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin clicked her tongue as she saw these people.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tsk.\u2019</p><br/><p>People who hadn\u2019t participated in the final battle.</p><br/><p>But Enbi Arin didn\u2019t blame these guys as she instead just sat on the ground and focused on recovering.</p><br/><p>Since there was nothing for these guys to eat up anyway.</p><br/><p>Actually them simply not attacking Enbi Arin and the rest who were resting was enough.</p><br/><p>\u2018Something that would never happen in the past.\u2019</p><br/><p>If it was the Orange Zone of the past that Hansoo hadn\u2019t organized then a second war would\u2019ve broken out already.</p><br/><p>Against the hyenas who were aiming for the runes that would drop by killing the tired people.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow\u2026 There\u2019s really nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the adventurers who had been fumbling around the Golden Akadus made an annoyed expression.</p><br/><p>Though they hadn\u2019t participated they had seen it from afar.</p><br/><p>For there to be no reward then the battle had been so fierce.</p><br/><p>At that moment the air above split apart as something appeared in the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>The expressions of the adventurers brightened up.</p><br/><p>Usually it was an existence they disliked but it was different now.</p><br/><p>Since there was only one reason for its appearance.</p><br/><p>Reward.</p><br/><p>\u2018Woah. Will I get to gobble something up even without lifting a finger?\u2019</p><br/><p>And as per their expectations, the fairy spoke out the words they all wanted to hear.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello everyone! Congratulations for surviving until the end! You could\u2019ve all been massacred but you got quite lucky!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know why I came out right? It\u2019s for your reward.\u201d</p><br/><p>The expressions of the people were split.</p><br/><p>The ones who participated in the battle were happy but they were a bit uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>And the ones who hadn\u2019t participated just wanted to eat up anything as profit.</p><br/><p>And of course the fairy brought this up first.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe benchmarks for receiving the reward this time around was very vague.\u201d</p><br/><p>The standards for the reward was very vague since it didn\u2019t come out like runes where the one who killed it will get it.</p><br/><p>But the fairy made a very delighted smile as it spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut receiving it for free is a bit troublesome. The present I have for you is the Dark Cloud.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Dark Cloud?\u2019</p><br/><p>The moment the fairy\u2019s words ended, something rolled out from around the bodies of the adventurers.</p><br/><p>Kurururururu</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh. Fascinating.\u201d</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin looked at the black colored cloud life form that was floating around her body after spontaneously coming into existence.</p><br/><p>The same cloud that had fallen to the blue spiders after fighting with her and the others crazily.</p><br/><p>But no vicious auras could be felt unlike before.</p><br/><p>Actually it was following Enbi Arin\u2019s will quite well, almost like a pet, and was floating around her body.</p><br/><p>Around all the bodies of the ones who had participated in the final battle.</p><br/><p>But it hadn\u2019t appeared on everyone\u2019s body and their sizes weren\u2019t the same either.</p><br/><p>In Enbi Arin\u2019s case, it was a few times bigger and darker than the other people\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Some didn\u2019t even receive it at all.</p><br/><p>One adventurer complained.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this based off of? Though I only got a little I still participated in the final battle.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fairy giggled.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really fair you see. The amount given is in accordance to how much of the Dark Cloud you got rid of.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Oh.\u201d</p><br/><p>The final battle.</p><br/><p>People who had participated in the final battle against the member of the Dark Cloud race.</p><br/><p>The ones who had fought most valiantly in the frontline and had destroyed a large amount of the Dark Cloud race\u2019s doppelgangers obtained a large amount of clouds and the ones who had stayed back or stayed around in safe spots couldn\u2019t receive any.</p><br/><p>And at these words the people who hadn\u2019t participated in the final battle made extremely regretful expressions.</p><br/><p>\u2018Goddamnit\u2026 I saved my life because they said there was no reward but for them to give out such a thing.\u2019</p><br/><p>Though they owed their life to Hansoo, it wasn\u2019t really that direct and the one life they had was precious.</p><br/><p>And they hadn\u2019t participated because they said there was no reward but for such things to have been given out to the participants.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tsk. It\u2019ll be nice at least if the effects suck.\u2019</p><br/><p>If another\u2019s possessions was also something amazing then there was nothing else that could make them feel even more jealous.*</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn\u2026 I should\u2019ve taken the right choice. Anyways, where is that Hansoo guy?\u2019</p><br/><p>Since that guy had taken the leader out on his own, he should have a much larger cloud than all of them.</p><br/><p>But soon shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, he\u2019ll return soon.\u2019</p><br/><p>Where could he go even if he wanted to?</p><br/><p>He would definitely come back here since it seemed like he would need their help to go up anyway.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo was acting in a completely opposite manner to their expectations.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Gwanje looked back and forth at the portal in front of him and Hansoo and then asked once more.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026You\u2019re really going up by yourself?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo, who had a cloud which was much larger and denser than Enbi Arin\u2019s surrounding him, nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I leave this place to you for you to organize. And don\u2019t let anyone come up until I allow them to. Make sure you control the portal well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gwanje asked with a confused expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it more helpful for us to go up together? There might be friction between you and the already existing powers.\u201d</p><br/><p>Numbers were always helpful.</p><br/><p>Hansoo shook his head at those words.</p><br/><p>Since Gwanje had received his soul fragment, he knew about Hansoo\u2019s identity to some degree.</p><br/><p>There was a reason to explain.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit wasteful for you guys to just get killed like that. You guys are too inexperienced.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRaise your strength and get organized to the best of your ability right here until I call you. The above world\u2026Humans are no longer the owners of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Red Zone.</p><br/><p>Humans took over instead of the fallen race, the Elvenheims.</p><br/><p>Orange Zone.</p><br/><p>Humans pushed away the weakened Akarons and took control of the Gragos\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>Though the 5 calamities and the Gragos were supernatural existences, they weren\u2019t interested in humans at all.</p><br/><p>But the Yellow Zone was different.</p><br/><p>A land where humans were hunted and eaten as well as treated as slaves, the Hunter\u2019s Plateau.</p><br/><p>Having a lot of people up above was basically allowing them to gain more targets.</p><br/><p>\u2018So\u2026I\u2019ll go up first and prepare.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo left behind his last words with Gwanje as he stabbed the Dragon Essence Blade in his hands into his body and then jumped into the portal.</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s Note: * This was originally a korean saying that I have altered into english to make more sense because the literal translation sounded stupid heh.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

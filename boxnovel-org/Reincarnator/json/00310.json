Kill them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGroup up! Be wary of the ground and the walls, and spread out the Lantanol powder!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Kang-Kions were not simple.</p><br/><p>How great would it be if they could simply defend against them just by being prepared?</p><br/><p>The Kang-Kions had already drilled through the walls and the ground; their bodies were so tough that not even well-sharpened swords could cut through them.</p><br/><p>Soon the inner parts of the fortress were filled with screams and the sound of the clashes between the Kang-Kions and the refugees.</p><br/><p>Uaaaaak!</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhuk! Block them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh...Damn!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell is happening?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Every member next to Hansoo, including Lauren, were shocked at the scene and all started pulling out their weapons.</p><br/><p>Since the Kang-Kions wouldn\u2019t leave the four unscathed.</p><br/><p>Kyaaaak!</p><br/><p>The Kang-Kions quickly transformed into leopards, leaping out from the ground beneath and rushing towards them.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Damn!\u2019</p><br/><p>Taesang grit his teeth, quickly surrounding himself with skills.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014</p><br/><p>Hansoo lifted his foot, and then slammed it down.</p><br/><p>\u2014Boooooooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>A huge, explosive sound rang out as the ground beneath them cracked open, fissures spreading outwards, web-like, in all directions.</p><br/><p>Dust flew up alongside the huge noise and created an enormous dust cloud.</p><br/><p>The Demonic Dragon Reinforcement that had spread out from Hansoo\u2019s foot hadn\u2019t stopped shaking the surface, and continued to burrow deeper into the ground, continuously producing shockwaves.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t only affect the beasts above the ground, the Kang-Kions\u2019 true bodies underground were hit as well.</p><br/><p>Kyaaak!</p><br/><p>Roar!</p><br/><p>The Kang-Kions, which had been created from the dirt but possessed bodies stronger than steel, broke back into dirt.</p><br/><p>The true bodies of the Kang-Kions had also started to disintegrate.</p><br/><p>Every Kang-Kion within a hundred-meter sphere around Hansoo had died from a single kick.</p><br/><p>Not only on the surface, but also underground.</p><br/><p>\u2014Clank\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014Clank Clank\u2014 </p><br/><p>Countless Kang-Kions in mid-air turned into violet crystals, falling down to the ground.</p><br/><p>Kiiiik. </p><br/><p>Karrrk. </p><br/><p>The other Kang-Kions started to tremble in fear at this sight.</p><br/><p>It was that being again.</p><br/><p>A mutant born from those animals they treated as food.</p><br/><p>That thing looked just like the other things beside it, but it was on a completely different level of its own.</p><br/><p>Maybe the other beings of the Abyss\u2014those that they sometimes met in the west and the south\u2014might be able to deal with it.</p><br/><p>Their race couldn\u2019t even dare to go up against such a thing.</p><br/><p>But there was one good thing about them.</p><br/><p>Some of those mutants didn\u2019t even bother protecting their own kind, and even crossed the line by treating their own race worse than how the Kang-Kions treated them.</p><br/><p>Kirrrrk! </p><br/><p>The Kang-Kions ran away in fear, and instead headed towards the fortress full of refugees.</p><br/><p>\u201c...They\u2019re running away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...\u201d</p><br/><p>Taesang stared at Hansoo in a daze after hearing what Lauren had said after checking the surroundings.</p><br/><p>He knew that Hansoo was strong.</p><br/><p>But not to this extent.</p><br/><p>For him to be able to make them run away with a single step.</p><br/><p>In that moment, something started to burn inside his mind.</p><br/><p>A desire.</p><br/><p>No.</p><br/><p>A fervour.</p><br/><p>\u2018If only I could become like that too\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Taesang continued to stare at Hansoo in a daze.</p><br/><p>\u2018...I guess I\u2019ll need to deal with this quickly.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo mumbled, as he looked at the Kang-Kions causing chaos.</p><br/><p>Dealing with this chaos wasn\u2019t the main issue.</p><br/><p>This was nothing more than a small step in the Dark King\u2019s quest to become stronger.</p><br/><p>\u2018If he knows the method of becoming stronger through the Abyssal Crystals, then\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>A transcendent, who already had the possibility of going over the limit, would only become stronger with each crystal they collected.</p><br/><p>Though it was one of the more efficient and weaker ways of becoming a transcendent, it was one of the fastest ways to raise one\u2019s strength.</p><br/><p>Like how an adult could still beat a kid to death even if they themselves were bad at fighting.</p><br/><p>The level of strength increasing in itself meant a lot.</p><br/><p>\u2018If one devoured all the Kang-Kions here\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>If that person became a 2-star transcendent then it would be more than just annoying.</p><br/><p>No, he wouldn\u2019t be able to beat them in the first place.</p><br/><p>Since the difference between a 2-star and a 1-star transcendent was like the difference between a transcendent and a normal being.</p><br/><p>If that was actually the case then thankfully, there weren\u2019t enough Kang-Kions nearby to actually reach that level.</p><br/><p>But of course it wasn\u2019t anything to scoff at either.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t enough to go from a 1-star to a 2-star transcendent, but one could still become terrifyingly stronger.</p><br/><p>If the person was given enough time to continue with his , then sooner or later that person would become a 2-star transcendent.</p><br/><p>He needed to deal with this person before he ate up all the Kang-Kions in the area.</p><br/><p>\u2018I guess\u2026 I\u2019ll need to prepare something else.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo came to a decision and then looked at Taesang.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys said that you collected crystals to climb up, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Taesang, who was still staring at Hansoo in a daze, nodded absently at the question.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo sensed the number of people inside the fortress and nodded.</p><br/><p>Close to 8,000 people.</p><br/><p>If there were enough crystals for all these people to go up, then they must\u2019ve worked long and hard to collect them, going through countless dangers to acquire them.</p><br/><p>Precious, precious crystals.</p><br/><p>But they wouldn\u2019t be using it to climb up.</p><br/><p>\u2018...8,000 is a bit low, but these should be useful.\u2019</p><br/><p>At the same time, he commanded.</p><br/><p>\u201cFollow me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even before Taesang could figure out what was going on.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?...Ahhhhh!\u201d</p><br/><p>The four of them, including Taesang, started to float upwards.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014Swooooosh!\u2014</p><br/><p>Hansoo, who was holding onto their clothes, jumped onto the fortress.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2014Booooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014Boom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2018F***ing hell\u2026 The amount of casualties are too high!\u2019</p><br/><p>Akran, one of the four leaders of the refugees, grit his teeth as he looked around at the fortress swarmed by Kang-Kions.</p><br/><p>Quite a large number of Kang-Kions, all heading towards the Dark King\u2019s War Fortress, had started to swarm into this place after realizing that there was a large amount of food.</p><br/><p>\u2018F***...it\u2019s the Dark King!\u2019</p><br/><p>Even these beasts cared for their own kind.</p><br/><p>Calling each other to share any food available.</p><br/><p>But that bastard Dark King, he drove his own kind to the very corners of the world.</p><br/><p>Though a transcendent being had no reason to defend the other humans, they had no reason to attack them either, right?</p><br/><p>Akran, after cursing the Dark King for quite a while, stood up.</p><br/><p>Danger brought with it opportunities.</p><br/><p>Though they had collected quite a large amount of crystals so far, they hadn\u2019t the courage to go near the elevator because the Dark King had settled next to it.</p><br/><p>But if this chaos was caused by the Dark King, then there was a high chance that he wouldn\u2019t be able to keep his attention on the elevator.</p><br/><p>Since there were many more Kang-Kions than usual for some reason.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yeah\u2026 To hell with it.\u2019</p><br/><p>Akran clenched his teeth.</p><br/><p>Normally they would\u2019ve needed more time to collect enough crystals for everyone, but since this was the case, it didn\u2019t matter anymore.</p><br/><p>Since a lot of people had already died.</p><br/><p>Akran shouted out loud.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone retreat! Maintain formation and head towards the elevator!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Charge through to the elevator like this!\u2019</p><br/><p>The survivors would use the crystals to go up.</p><br/><p>As Akran shouted.</p><br/><p>The other three leaders swung their spears and slowly started to create a battle formation to valiantly retreat valiantly to the front.</p><br/><p>\u2018Good.\u2019</p><br/><p>Looking at the formation that was barely holding on, Akran clenched his teeth and ran.</p><br/><p>Since he had another job to do.</p><br/><p>\u2018Crystals...I must get the crystals.\u2019</p><br/><p>Without the crystals, there would be no exit for them even if they reached the elevator.</p><br/><p>He needed to quickly retrieve the crystals and distribute them to everyone.</p><br/><p>As long as they could reach the elevator, and even if they were seperated, the crystals would help them go up.</p><br/><p>Akran dashed madly towards the storage area holding the crystals.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014Boom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014Boom! Boom!\u2014</p><br/><p>Explosive sounds could be heard behind them, causing Akran to turn around in shock.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s him!\u2019</p><br/><p>The moment something rose high above the walls of the fortress, Akran\u2019s expression brightened up.</p><br/><p>\u2018If he could help us\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Then they would be able to lessen the number of casualties even further.</p><br/><p>And as he expected.</p><br/><p>\u2014Boom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Kyaaaak!</p><br/><p>Kurrrrr!</p><br/><p>With every step, the Kang-Kions died screaming.</p><br/><p>Though he moved over dozens of meters with every step, every Kang-Kion in a radius of a hundred meters were killed off every time his foot made contact with the ground.</p><br/><p>And thanks to this, the people who had been fighting in the nearby area were able to help their comrades in other places.</p><br/><p>A simple walk had changed the battlefield.</p><br/><p>\u2018If only we could have a person like that\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Akran made a depressed expression but soon shook his head.</p><br/><p>An uncontrollable bomb was better than nothing.</p><br/><p>If that man suddenly changed his mind, what would happen to them?</p><br/><p>He could not possibly understand the thoughts of a transcendent since he didn\u2019t have the strength to treat all other human beings as ants like they did.</p><br/><p>\u2018But...this is still good enough.\u2019</p><br/><p>But then\u2014 </p><br/><p>Akran\u2019s expression suddenly turned for the worse.</p><br/><p>He had realized where the man was heading to.</p><br/><p>\u2018No\u2026.NO!\u2019</p><br/><p>Akran roared in despair as he looked at where Hansoo was heading.</p><br/><p>\u201cNO! NO! YOU BASTARD! NO!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014Boom!\u2014</p><br/><p>Akran continued to roar as he madly dashed off in the same direction.</p><br/><p>Towards the storage area the man was currently approaching.</p><br/><p>But sadly, Hansoo\u2019s speed was much greater than that of Akran\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Extremely so.</p><br/><p>\u2014Whooosh!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo arrived at the storage area first.</p><br/><p>And by the time Akran caught up to him, the doors were already being ripped apart.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou f***ing bastard...Stop!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Wait...Could it be? No way!\u2019</p><br/><p>He\u2019d had a strange suspicion once.</p><br/><p>That maybe the Abyssal Crystals were the secrets of the transcendents.</p><br/><p>But he didn\u2019t know how to use them in the first place, plus these things were too precious to use without solid proof.</p><br/><p>But sadly it looked like his previous guess was correct.</p><br/><p>Hansoo merely shook his head at Akran.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to use it for myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>He wouldn\u2019t use the crystals to strengthen himself.</p><br/><p>Well, he could, but it would be very inefficient in the long run.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Akran replied dazedly, but Hansoo merely walked into the storage area. There was no time to explain everything to this person one-by-one.</p><br/><p>\u2014Whooosh\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo collected the violet crystals into a single area and looked towards the War Fortress in the distance.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u2014Crunch\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014Crack\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2018Good...very good.\u2019</p><br/><p>The limitations inside his body were breaking apart.</p><br/><p>The very rules that bound everyone in this world shattered apart as it changed for him and him alone.</p><br/><p>A change that allowed him to become the center of the world.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn...Is this how you felt as well?\u2019</p><br/><p>The Dark King felt the energy from the violet light being sucked into his body. He smiled as he thought of the transcendent in the past.</p><br/><p>The man who had turned him, a normal human, into a transcendent.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

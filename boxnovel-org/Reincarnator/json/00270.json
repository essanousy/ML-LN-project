What is that anyway?\u2019</p><br/><p>As the flat object in the man\u2019s hand collided against the alloy wall.</p><br/><p>The energy field surrounding the alloy wall was dispersed.</p><br/><p>This was the reason why the man had been able to smash apart the alloy wall all by himself.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn. Is there a way to\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>A small wisp of greed appeared inside the player\u2019s minds but they suppressed it.</p><br/><p>Since attacking somebody from the Empire was a crazy act in itself and there was something else that made them more curious.</p><br/><p>What would be behind the alloy wall?</p><br/><p>Kiiiiing!</p><br/><p>But right before the entrance was broken apart.</p><br/><p>The man who had been attacking the wall, Jang Oh, suddenly stopped.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, why did you stop!?\u201d</p><br/><p>While the players were questioning his actions.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jang Oh looked around at the players and then let out a wave of darkness.</p><br/><p>Nothing tremendously lethal but it was still powerful enough to severely damage them.</p><br/><p>And everybody dodged while cursing in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell man! Why!?\u201d</p><br/><p>As the players backed up.</p><br/><p>\u2018Heup.\u2019</p><br/><p>Jang Oh gathered up all the strength in his body and smashed the wall under his feet.</p><br/><p>Booooom!</p><br/><p>The alloy wall that had been badly damaged gave up as a hole appeared.</p><br/><p>Jang Oh left behind the players and jumped down.</p><br/><p>Whoosh!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell man!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you going alone!\u201d</p><br/><p>The players who had backed up all charged towards the hole.</p><br/><p>Because they were going crazy from curiosity by this point.</p><br/><p>But at that point.</p><br/><p>\u201cBack off you bastards.\u201d</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>The man let out a tremendous amount of darkness and prevented the players from coming in.</p><br/><p>And everybody freaked out at this attack and ran away again.</p><br/><p>Soon the small hole had closed up again due to the alloy wall\u2019s regeneration.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhhh! Fucking bastard!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow dare a mere NPC do this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everybody started to vent their anger by cursing off Jang Oh who had left them behind.</p><br/><p>They had been wary of going in so far but now the story had changed.</p><br/><p>An extremely mysterious space that may be the beginning of a giant quest.</p><br/><p>And the beautiful world that they saw for a moment before the hole had closed up.</p><br/><p>Bright lights, a clear lake and lush forests.</p><br/><p>This was not something that should exist hundred of meters below the ice in the northernmost tundra.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell! Why did they tell us to stay then!? Didn\u2019t they need us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd he said he was the 4th brigade! Why did he come alone!?\u201d</p><br/><p>If he was going to go in alone then why did the Empire act like this?</p><br/><p>And why did they send them a message to stay here?</p><br/><p>\u2018Fucking hell\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>As everybody was grinding their teeth in rage.</p><br/><p>One of the players shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go in everybody!\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no reason for them to not.</p><br/><p>Though they couldn\u2019t break through because they lacked numbers before, they had more than enough now.</p><br/><p>They just needed to cooperate to isolate the mana flowing through the alloy wall and penetrate through it.</p><br/><p>Everybody acquiesced at these words.</p><br/><p>\u201cSure!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah! Do you even know how many are watching this!? We need to show them what\u2019s inside!\u201d</p><br/><p>The man who had shouted smiled contently.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m going to see it with my own eyes. And\u2026 Kill those guys if we get the chance.\u2019</p><br/><p>The man smiled.</p><br/><p>Those who were monsters.</p><br/><p>People who someone like him could not even dream of handling.</p><br/><p>But seeing the situation now, they would probably fight each other inside.</p><br/><p>At least one side will get turned into a mess.</p><br/><p>Which gave them an opportunity.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is going to be a jackpot. Hehehe.\u2019</p><br/><p>The mysterious shield the man had.</p><br/><p>And the glittering artifacts the man who they had been chasing had around his body.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is basically a present box.\u2019</p><br/><p>Boooobobooooom!</p><br/><p>The players started to break apart the wall while thinking about the scenery inside and the two people who would be fighting to the death.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Rummble!</p><br/><p>As a man fell down from the hole.</p><br/><p>Whooosh!</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s body got surrounded by shadows and then appeared right before Hansoo.</p><br/><p>Crossing across hundreds of meters in an instant.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo frowned at this.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hmm.\u2019</p><br/><p>It seemed like he used a skill but because it had mixed with the shadows around Jang Oh\u2019s body, it was hard to tell.</p><br/><p>Hansoo muttered to himself as he looked at Jang Oh who had perfectly integrated his skills and the shadow together.</p><br/><p>\u2018A man with many secrets.\u2019</p><br/><p>Though they were quite close in the past, Jang Oh was extremely protective of the people in his village and did not show anybody how he worked.</p><br/><p>Since he always worked solo.</p><br/><p>And Jang Oh was frowning as he appeared before Hansoo.</p><br/><p>But it wasn\u2019t from the rage he had against Hansoo.</p><br/><p>&lt;..........&gt;</p><br/><p>Jang Oh frowned at the constant trembles of the soul fragment in his head and then shouted in his mind. . Though they, were ones with the soul fragments, were made to forcibly listen to the orders of the soul, they weren\u2019t under control from the Lord symbol from Clementine\u2019s clan.</p><br/><p>Since the powers of a clan didn\u2019t work through dimensions.</p><br/><p>They all had their own thoughts and motivations. &lt;.....&gt;</p><br/><p>Jang Oh released his frown as the fragment loosened up and smiled towards Hansoo.</p><br/><p>WIth an expression full of respect.</p><br/><p>And not only his expression.</p><br/><p>Jang Oh spoke towards Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cAmazing. You\u2019re the second person I\u2019ve seen in my life who is this amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>The first was Clementine.</p><br/><p>He himself had rampaged through the lower areas.</p><br/><p>But the moment he saw Clementine he understood that the world was large and there was a lot of monstrous people.</p><br/><p>Jang Oh decided to follow Clementine due to Clementine\u2019s endless potential in leadership and how she took extreme care of her own people.</p><br/><p>Since it felt like there would be no more dangers if he followed Clementine.</p><br/><p>\u2018I never thought there would be somebody else besides Clementine who could shock me.\u2019</p><br/><p>Jang Oh whistled.</p><br/><p>Actually, this guy was beyond Clementine.</p><br/><p>According to what he heard, this guy had saved the World Tree, dealt with the Gragos of the Orange Zone and even killed off all the God-like higher races of the Yellow Zone.</p><br/><p>In a world like this where it was hard to even keep one\u2019s own life, this man had saved an uncountable amount of people.</p><br/><p>His achievements made him look like a hero who might appear in legends.</p><br/><p>And deserving of his reputation, he had pushed out the damned players and revived the Ains even in this Green Zone.</p><br/><p>\u2018How worthy of respect. You\u2026 Are doing something that I\u2019ve wanted to do so much but could not.\u2019</p><br/><p>His other comrades were telling him to get revenge for Metiron and kill the man in front of him but his thoughts were different.</p><br/><p>Kiiiiing.</p><br/><p>Jang Oh spoke towards Hansoo in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done well so far but stop here.\u201d</p><br/><p>This guy couldn\u2019t even beat him, much less Tiamet.</p><br/><p>Jang Oh continued to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis was good enough. The thing you\u2019re doing\u2026 Is enraging Tiamet. Stop here and join us instead.\u201d</p><br/><p>This guy\u2019s skill would help him and Clementine tremendously.</p><br/><p>Even if this guy wasn\u2019t needed, he liked Hansoo a lot for a strange reason and really wished to recruit him.</p><br/><p>So he had told him about Tiamet.</p><br/><p>To make him give up on his own.</p><br/><p>And to make him join his side.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019ve seen it as well. That power.\u2019</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know what was beyond that mountain range.</p><br/><p>But one thing was clear.</p><br/><p>That the thing this guy was doing here was something Tiamet deeply cared about and wanted to prevent.</p><br/><p>If he succeeded then Tiamet would stand up from his seat with a towering rage.</p><br/><p>Forsaking everything else.</p><br/><p>\u2018Just give up. We\u2019re just\u2026 People who are passing by. But if you continue to resist\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Jang Oh thought of his comrades who were caught like hostages and then clenched his hold on the blackish shield.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWe got through!\u201d</p><br/><p>Booooom!</p><br/><p>The players shouted in glee from the hole in the wall.</p><br/><p>But this glee only lasted for a moment.</p><br/><p>People started to shout at the hole which had already started to shrink.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Not all of us can go in! We have to keep this up!\u201d</p><br/><p>A few of the people here would have to stay and keep attacking it to prevent it closing back up again.</p><br/><p>A few of the people laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s no reason for all of us to go in right?\u201d</p><br/><p>In the distance.</p><br/><p>Inside the cylindrical world.</p><br/><p>There was a very unique looking area inside this place.</p><br/><p>A factory-like structure which was surrounded by giant walls.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s see what\u2019s there first.\u2019</p><br/><p>Though normal people were afraid of mystery, they weren't.</p><br/><p>\u2018We\u2019re immortal.\u2019</p><br/><p>The mysterious only roused up their curiosity further.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha! Let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEverybody, can you see! Continue to tune in since we haven\u2019t started fighting yet!\u201d</p><br/><p>The players smiled at the giant structures from above and then started to fall one by one.</p><br/><p>Towards the ground.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

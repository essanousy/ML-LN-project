Unbelievable.\u2019</p><br/><p>There was a rumor.</p><br/><p>That one bug player had caused all this.</p><br/><p>He destroyed the Great Maze, pulled out the Ains, suppressed the \u2018Red Dragon Wielder\u2019 Arthus Krancheska, the captain of the Magic Brigade, and ate up the War Fortress.</p><br/><p>This was something that the entire Hydros Clan could not accomplish.</p><br/><p>But for him to have done this all by himself.</p><br/><p>\u2018It doesn\u2019t seem like a fake rumor\u2026 We need to see how much of this is the truth.\u2019</p><br/><p>Though intel was being gathered at a rapid pace, it hadn\u2019t been long since the event had occurred.</p><br/><p>And because there were lots of other random information from all around, there was a huge lack of time to gather the important intel.</p><br/><p>There was also a bigger issue as well.</p><br/><p>\u2018What do I do with this\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Karon touched the high quality mail in his hand and pressed down on his temples because of the headache.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Squeak.</p><br/><p>The door of the building used as the clan\u2019s office opened up as a man walked in.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh. Clan Leader. There\u2019s an interesting piece of information.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...What is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Unlike the other clans, the Hydros Clan was created through close relationships and top players joining afterwards.</p><br/><p>Most of the high ranked individuals came in with connections so they were all close to each other.</p><br/><p>Karon asked back in confusion as he heard the story from the leader of the hunting teams.</p><br/><p>\u201c...So you\u2019re telling me that the one who caused the ruckus here is in the center of the Spirit Land which takes days to go to ? And he erased an entire hunting team of our clan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Apparently they found this out after getting pissed off when they got killed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is insane. Can he teleport or something as well then?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Spirit Land didn\u2019t have warp gates.</p><br/><p>So the only method to travel was on foot.</p><br/><p>As Karon was befuddled at the fact that somebody who should be here was all the way over at the most northern lands of the Spirit Land.</p><br/><p>The guy shrugged his shoulders as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe rumor has already been spread all around. Those guys were so pissed that they went around spreading it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh\u2026 Fucking hell. The northernmost area? Ugh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As Karon tightly clenched his head like it was about to explode, the man asked in confusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t we just need to buy time? What\u2019s to gain from killing him?\u201d</p><br/><p>According to the rumors, he was an extremely powerful individual.</p><br/><p>And killing one person didn\u2019t give much profit.</p><br/><p>It was better to focus on the treasure chest in front of their eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2018If we could just get through that\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>The War Fortress which had buckled up like a turtle.</p><br/><p>But everybody knew how sweet the meat inside this thick shell would be.</p><br/><p>As the leader gulped his saliva at the War Fortress in the distance.</p><br/><p>Karon shook his head as he handed over the message in his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust read it and see what\u2019s on it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As he read the message from Karon.</p><br/><p>His expression turned grim as well.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201cSo\u2026 They were ordered to hunt me down no matter what?\u201d</p><br/><p>Crunch.</p><br/><p>As Hansoo asked the man while grabbing him by the throat, the player spat as he replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh...Then do you think we\u2019d be chasing you like this otherwise? You\u2019re dead now. Using hacks unfairly like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>If the man who he was choking was a normal civilian of this world he might\u2019ve been trembling in fear of death but sadly he was a player.</p><br/><p>The player looked at Hansoo in annoyance while grinding his teeth.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fucking hell. What a waste of time.\u2019</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t annoy him because this guy was strong.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t like they died and there was a limit to how much one could take.</p><br/><p>He just didn\u2019t like the situation itself.</p><br/><p>The Empire did promise them rewards.</p><br/><p>But it wasn\u2019t asking for a favor but rather giving them a command.</p><br/><p>How would they move around in a world like this without Warp Gates and without the support of those powers?</p><br/><p>And seeing their reaction, it seemed like they were going to forcefully send them into the Spirit Land if they didn\u2019t comply.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fucking hell. How dare a fucking NPC do this. They tried so hard to please us up until now.\u2019</p><br/><p>During the ages when the Kingdoms and the Empires fought, the NPCs tried very hard to drag the players and the 15 Great Clans.</p><br/><p>But they had all united now.</p><br/><p>The 15 clans could clearly feel that they were outsiders now.</p><br/><p>A tremendous difference in strength.</p><br/><p>They could still the visualize Cykrus smashing apart the earth with his giant greatsword.</p><br/><p>Of course they could fight against these NPCs since they didn\u2019t die.</p><br/><p>But what would be left for them?</p><br/><p>There won\u2019t be any fun in playing in a world filled with ruins if they won and losing would cause an even bigger problem.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fucking bastards. They should just do it themselves.\u2019</p><br/><p>But everyone already knew that the people from the Kingdoms and the Empires couldn\u2019t set foot in the Spirit Land.</p><br/><p>Though it was shitty, the only method they had was to kill this guy.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo thought about the situation for a bit and then started to chuckle.</p><br/><p>Crunch.</p><br/><p>Whoosh!</p><br/><p>Hansoo broke the neck and then looked around as the player started to turn into golden light.</p><br/><p>Holes and broken ice.</p><br/><p>And artifacts everywhere.</p><br/><p>Things the players dropped as they got killed while chasing him around.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s already been 3 days since they started chasing me huh.\u2019</p><br/><p>3 days.</p><br/><p>This was the time he had been looking for the traces of the blessing in the Spirit Land while smashing these things apart.</p><br/><p>Following the way the symbol in his chest was telling him to go, all the way up to right below the mountain range.</p><br/><p>He could see the raging blizzard above the mountain which rose up almost vertically.</p><br/><p>This was not something that he could withstand with just blessings.</p><br/><p>Since Mudusella wouldn\u2019t ask something impossible, he needed to find a way to go in but it was nowhere to be seen.</p><br/><p>Which meant that there was only one possibility left.</p><br/><p>\u2018Underground.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo mumbled as he looked at the hard, frozen ground below his feet.</p><br/><p>Though snow and ice were covering it, nobody really knew how deep it would go.</p><br/><p>\u2018...I\u2019ll have to use the Nine Dragons Spear.\u2019</p><br/><p>As Hansoo gripped his spear.</p><br/><p>Dragons started to slowly appear and surround his body.</p><br/><p>All the way up to seven.</p><br/><p>Hansoo tapped on the ground but there was no telling what was below this.</p><br/><p>Which meant that seven dragons might or might not work.</p><br/><p>But he only got out seven and pointed straight down.</p><br/><p>Since he might have to fight against the players even after smashing his way down in the worst case scenario.</p><br/><p>In a situation like this where people were chasing him down from all areas, using a skill like the Nine Dragons Spear which had a huge aftereffect was something risky.</p><br/><p>In some ways, it might be better to regroup back at the War Fortress and slowly go through with the Ains instead of smashing his way down.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo laughed coldly and prepared to attack below.</p><br/><p>\u2018You feel impatient huh?\u2019</p><br/><p>The Kingdoms and the Empires were trying way too hard just to recover some pride or for revenge.</p><br/><p>Which meant one thing.</p><br/><p>That the issue wasn\u2019t him, but rather the one sent him here and his current location.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo was very happy to see this.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s see what you have hidden here.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Kill that guy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFucking bastard!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo glanced between the tall vertical mountain covered in layers of snow and the players charging at him from the distance, smiled coldly as he smashed downwards with his spear.</p><br/><p>With the black orb created from seven dragons.</p><br/><p>Boooooooom!</p><br/><p>Though the Tundra was extremely hard, it couldn\u2019t withstand the Nine Dragons Spear.</p><br/><p>A tremendous noise occurred as the floor below Hansoo started to break apart.</p><br/><p>Smashing apart the ice and melting the snow.</p><br/><p>And into the darkness below.</p><br/><p>Whooosh!</p><br/><p>Hansoo, who had started to fall into the extremely deep hole slowly, used his leftover mana to attack upwards and accelerate his descent.</p><br/><p>To go down even faster.</p><br/><p>And the players accelerated further as they saw this.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis bastard! Digging his own grave! You just wait right there!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fucked!\u201d</p><br/><p>The bloodied body of 3 days of chase.</p><br/><p>The depleted mana from the big skill.</p><br/><p>Hansoo shrugged at the players charging at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys will be able to use it as well if you\u2019re lucky.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>As one of the players stopped at his words right before they jumped down into the darkness.</p><br/><p>Rummmmbleeee!</p><br/><p>All the snow that was layered on top of the mountain next to him started to fall down with a tremendous noise.</p><br/><p>Creating a gigantic avalanche in the process.</p><br/><p>\u201cHoly shit!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUaaaa! Run away!\u201d</p><br/><p>The players screamed at the sudden avalanche that had occurred.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Oooooong.</p><br/><p>\u2018...What a rat.\u2019</p><br/><p>Sounds of cracking came out from the hands of Tiamet, who was sitting eyes closed and holding the stake above the White Dragon Arena.</p><br/><p>Though the Godly Weapon couldn\u2019t break, it was more than enough to show how distressed Tiamet was.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s really annoying huh. Just like you said.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJang Oh. Spit it out if you have something to say. Don\u2019t stay silent.\u201d</p><br/><p>The dark shadowy man gazed back at Tiamet expressionlessly.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

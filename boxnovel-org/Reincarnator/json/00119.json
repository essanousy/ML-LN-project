Tiradus huh\u2026 I\u2019ve only heard about it, for such a thing to exist.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gwanje mumbled as he looked at Hansoo.</p><br/><p>He had never actually seen a Tiradus himself.</p><br/><p>The reason why he knew about the Tiradus was because of a line from a piece of literature.</p><br/><p>That one of their seniors, Kangtae, had left behind as a form of a book.</p><br/><p>\u2018Even if you say it like that\u2026 Who could actually go that deep into the Forest of Horns?\u2019</p><br/><p>Since there were a large amount of strong beasts within the Forest of Horns, it was often used as a hunting ground for high level clans.</p><br/><p>There were three immediate outposts from the Rerorerore clans near the forest and another outpost from the strongest clan, , also existed nearby.</p><br/><p>And 12 other different outposts for hunting were spread around the Forest of Horns and there were also locations where high level adventurers who weren\u2019t in clans visited often.</p><br/><p>The location where the biggest amount of human forces were concentrated.</p><br/><p>There were enormous amounts of people as well.</p><br/><p>But no one would go deep within the Forest of Horns.</p><br/><p>Since the Forest of Horns was infamous for its swarming numbers of Margoths.</p><br/><p>There were a lot of food for the Margoths since there were more veins/arteries containing body fluids around the head and if you wanted to exaggerate a little bit, there were so many Margoths here that while you\u2019re trying to catch one, another one would be running towards you.</p><br/><p>\u2018If that thing eats these Margoths then\u2026 It should be humongous right?\u2019</p><br/><p>He was told that it ate these Margoths that towered multiple kilometers in length.</p><br/><p>It was probably as large as a small mountain.</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know how we\u2019re supposed to catch such a thing.\u2019</p><br/><p>While Gwanje was clicking his tongue, Hansoo dusted himself off the ground.</p><br/><p>Which meant that the three people receiving the body modification surgery inside the tanks had fallen asleep.</p><br/><p>Gwanje asked Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do? Is it ten now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Himself, the enhanced three, Hansoo and the five pillars of the Akaron.</p><br/><p>Ten total.</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we look at a single Tiradus itself then\u2026 It\u2019s a possible feat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich means it\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gwanje frowned.</p><br/><p>If they consider only a single Tiradus then it was possible.</p><br/><p>Which meant that there was no way to deal with the Margoths they would meet on the way.</p><br/><p>Since the Tiradus resided within the deepest parts of the forest.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow are you going to deal with the other forces we have then?\u201d</p><br/><p>In Gwanje\u2019s head, they needed at least 15 to 20 more Margoth level people in order to get through the Margoths on the way.</p><br/><p>Of course it might be enough if they collected everyone in the top 6 as well as the ones that roamed around separately.</p><br/><p>But he was sure that it would still be impossible to kill the Tiradus even if they filled the numbers of 20 after catching those people.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you trying to go on a conquest or something? If you want to gather that many Margoth level people then you would at least need to unify everything under the heavens.\u201d</p><br/><p>Such a dream team wouldn\u2019t be possible unless they were to smash down every clan beneath their feet.</p><br/><p>Hansoo sighed at those words.</p><br/><p>He then spoke towards Gwanje.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2026 would probably be possible thanks to you. Sadly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou ate too many Graphites.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The captain of the shock troopers of the Rerorerore clan, Kanch, sighed and wiped his sword while he was resting in the middle of the Forest of Horns.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did all those guys from the Ursa Major go? After leaving us behind here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh. If you get caught saying something like that you will die.\u201d</p><br/><p>As his comrade next to him rebuked him, he replied in a depressing manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey might be so incredible but how could they have a skill to hear things thousands of kilometers away. Anyways, don\u2019t we have no way of dealing with the Akarons without them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kanch finished speaking and then gazed through the trees across the forest to look at the Akarons who were glaring at him and his group.</p><br/><p>Though he was at the peak of the Baladi level, those Akarons there were Margoth levels.</p><br/><p>It was too much for them.</p><br/><p>Where did Akaella and Gwanje run off to?</p><br/><p>\u2018Only after killing those guys would I be able to receive the body enhancement surgery or something and then go up. Where the hell did these guys go?\u2019</p><br/><p>While Kanch was frowning and glaring at the Akarons, a ruckus was created in the midst of the Akarons.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Run\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry and away \u2026 Gragos\u2026There\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Loud voices that could be heard all the way here.</p><br/><p>The Akarons shouted at each other and then started to quickly run away in numerous directions.</p><br/><p>Not towards this cliff, which was their location, but through a completely different path.</p><br/><p>Kanch freaked out as he saw this as he also got up.</p><br/><p>If those guys run away and hide then what would happen to everything they have done so far?</p><br/><p>\u2018Kim Gwanje this bastard. Not even finishing them off and doing your job properly as a clan leader!\u2019</p><br/><p>Kanch quickly rose up and then shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re trying to get out from the Forest of Horns! Create tracking teams, 2nd, 4th, 7th divisions block the way towards area 20 and the 1st division come with me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018I need to find out the reason why they\u2019re running away.\u2019</p><br/><p>Though Kanch grumbled a lot, he had grown quite a lot while roaming around the Otherworld for 7 years.</p><br/><p>The Rerorerore clan quickly formed tracking teams and then prepared themselves.</p><br/><p>\u2018Good. They\u2019re all ready.\u2019</p><br/><p>Kanch made a content expression as he looked at the 1st division that was completely armed from head to toe and were standing behind him.</p><br/><p>A 30-man team only made of Baladi levels.</p><br/><p>People who he had dragged under him in order to have some strength within the clan.</p><br/><p>He would even be able to kill a Margoth-level person with this much power.</p><br/><p>Though all of them were a bit insane, this was actually better.</p><br/><p>\u2018Since the crazier they are, the better they fight.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go! Just scout their trails lightly and then group with the tracking teams.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kanch then flew into the sky.</p><br/><p>He was going to scout them from high up.</p><br/><p>Though he didn\u2019t do this often since he would be exposing his location to the other clansmen but that didn\u2019t matter right now.</p><br/><p>Kanch raised his body 500m into the air and then looked at the trails of the Akarons.</p><br/><p>And then quickly shouted beneath him.</p><br/><p>\u201cRun away! Get to the 2nd outpost! 2nd outpost! The Gracios are on a stampede!\u201d</p><br/><p>Akol, the vice leader of the 1st division, frowned as he heard Kanch\u2019s shouts.</p><br/><p>The 2nd outpost was in the complete opposite direction of the direction the Akarons were running in.</p><br/><p>Which means that he had completely given up the Akarons.</p><br/><p>\u2018What the hell. Why is the Gracios coming towards us a problem?\u2019</p><br/><p>Akol made a confused expression.</p><br/><p>The Margoths Du Gracios which were the most numerous in numbers were quite big but they were slow so they didn\u2019t move that fast.</p><br/><p>And they didn\u2019t really like to chew on humans so they weren\u2019t that threatening.</p><br/><p>\u2018A joke. To kill such things and to call themselves a Margoth level.\u2019</p><br/><p>Others freaked out at Margoth levels but he was never afraid.</p><br/><p>And his actual hobby was sliding down the backs of Gracioses.</p><br/><p>The moment Akol snorted at this the ground started to rumble and shake.</p><br/><p>Akol suddenly freaked out.</p><br/><p>Since this wasn\u2019t a vibration that happened when the Margoths moved slowly.</p><br/><p>Kuoooooooo!</p><br/><p>At that moment large roars were heard in the distance.</p><br/><p>From hundreds of locations at the same time.</p><br/><p>Then the cliff the Akarons were hiding behind instantly got destroyed.</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>Akol freaked out as he started to run away.</p><br/><p>\u201cUwaaaaaa!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kuoooooo!</p><br/><p>Hundreds of beasts that towered multiple kilometers high were on a mad stampede.</p><br/><p>Akol finally realized why the others were afraid of Margoth levels.</p><br/><p>\u2018Those guys killed things like this?!?!\u2019</p><br/><p>There was a huge difference between them standing around calmly and when they were mad.</p><br/><p>Since the mountains collapsed and the ground cracked apart.</p><br/><p>The trees that got hit by the bodies of the Margoths flew out like meteors so the clansmen who were in the way of it turned into a mud of flesh.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why are they in such a hurry!\u2019</p><br/><p>Akol dodged the wooden fragments as he clenched his teeth.</p><br/><p>The hundreds of Gracioses were stealing glances behind their back as they were madly trying to get away from something.</p><br/><p>In the same manner that they were trying to get away from the Gracioses.</p><br/><p>What kind of existence did one need to be in order to make these things deathly afraid.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ve never seen such a creature before?\u2019</p><br/><p>Crack</p><br/><p>The moment Akol made a confused expression and looked behind him.</p><br/><p>Booooooong</p><br/><p>Something appeared in the air while flapping its wings.</p><br/><p>\u2018Uh?\u2019</p><br/><p>Akol squinted his eyes.</p><br/><p>Since it was extremely small.</p><br/><p>No, it wasn\u2019t that small.</p><br/><p>Since the 10m tall steel angel was much larger than humans and also looked much sturdier.</p><br/><p>But this was as far as humans went.</p><br/><p>Compared to the Gracios, they weren\u2019t even comparable to the flies that sucked blood from the cows.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is that?\u2019</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>The steel angel in the air suddenly disappeared.</p><br/><p>Akol\u2019s eyes couldn\u2019t even track it.</p><br/><p>Kuduk</p><br/><p>Kuuuunngg!</p><br/><p>At that moment the giant male Gracios that was in the very back cried out in pain.</p><br/><p>And then something smashed through the heart of the Gracios as it ran away.</p><br/><p>The steel angel that had disappeared from Akol\u2019s vision.</p><br/><p>Udududuk</p><br/><p>The Gracios that looked like the leader of them all fell down even without being able to scream.</p><br/><p>And the thing that smashed through the giant heart laughed as it started to chew down on the thing in its hands.</p><br/><p>Akol felt a chill run down his back as he ran in order to get away.</p><br/><p>Kiruruk</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>The angel frowned as it saw Akol run away.</p><br/><p>It pulled out the thing it was eating from within its mouth and then threw it like a projectile.</p><br/><p>Puguk</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Uk? Uwuhh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Akol made an expression of disbelief at the thing that had pierced through his heart.</p><br/><p>A very small bone fragment that seemed to belong to the Gracios.</p><br/><p>And in his blurring vision, he could see a beastly existence that was throwing things in all directions as if it was trying to catch everything.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce the Margoths move out the Tiradus will come out. Though it would become easier for me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo mumbled.</p><br/><p>Margoth du Tiradus.</p><br/><p>It would survive on a single Margoth for a whole year.</p><br/><p>So this predator didn\u2019t really run around much as it stayed asleep in the deepest part of the Forest.</p><br/><p>But there is indeed a time when this guy goes on a rampage.</p><br/><p>The great move of the Margoths.</p><br/><p>Once the Margoths come out to the body of the Gragos in search for food, these guys would start killing. Not for food but as a .</p><br/><p>The target of this hunt was every other Margoths other than the Tiradus.</p><br/><p>\u201cA lot will die. So we need to catch it fast. Focus and let\u2019s go. Since their treatments finished up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Gwanje looked into the sky in a daze even while listening to Hansoo\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Proofreader\u2019s note</p><br/><p>Regular chapter 1/3.</p><br/><p>Apparently, some people would appreciate it if there was a easy-to-follow summary for chapters.</p><br/><p>Summing up this chapter:</p><br/><p>\u2013 Massive charge of the Margoths out of the forest of horns because lack of body fluid, due to Gwanje\u2019s recent actions</p><br/><p>\u2013 The Tiradus likes to hunt Margoths when that happens, this saves Hansoo a lot of trouble and manpower going deep into the forest</p><br/><p>\u2013 The Tiradus is a creepy metallic angel 10m tall</p><br/><p>\u2013 The three already Margoth-level of the Rerorerore clan have finished their treatment. They\u2019re going to be *a lot* stronger and under Hansoo\u2019s control</p><br/><p>\u2013 Hansoo is going to use the dream,team of himself, Gwanje, the three Ursa Majors of Rerorerore and the five pillars of the Akaron to hunt the Tiradus</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Hahaha! This is how you do it properly!\u201d</p><br/><p>The man laughed out maniacally as he let out even more copious amounts of lightning.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014rummmble!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014rumble!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Thunder roared out as it smashed into Hansoo\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>It was more than enough energy to go through Hansoo\u2019s Thousand Soldiers Armor, past his Reinforcement, and burn his body.</p><br/><p>\u2014chiiiiiiik\u2014 </p><br/><p>The Dark King, who had been watching the fight while pondering as to which side to take, was shocked at this sight.</p><br/><p>\u201cUghh\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018...How can he be so strong?\u2019</p><br/><p>He had thought that strength was the most important thing, so he had continued to collect the crystals.</p><br/><p>And the amount he had collected was much higher compared to this man fighting Hansoo, the man called .</p><br/><p>But for some reason, Hansoo and Zeus\u2019s strength seemed to be much, much stronger than his own.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Which side do I take? Damn.\u2019</p><br/><p>And as the Dark King continued to ponder\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014boooooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014Hansoo charged through the sea of lightning and smashed his spear towards the man\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u2018How dare you\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Though the Dark King was weak because he hadn\u2019t been refining properly, he himself was different.</p><br/><p>As Zeus scoffed and was about to attack again with his dagger, \u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014shudder\u2014 </p><br/><p>Chills ran down his back as his entire bodily senses started to scream out in danger.</p><br/><p>Zeus then realized the black marble that was heading towards him.</p><br/><p>\u2018That\u2019s\u2026dangerous!\u2019</p><br/><p>If he were attacked by that black orb, together with Hangsoo\u2019s reinforcement, then even he himself wouldn\u2019t remain unscathed.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014</p><br/><p>Right as both attacks closed in, a strange powdered metal appeared around the man\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s go.\u2019</p><br/><p>Thunder King\u2019s Strike.</p><br/><p>A power that allowed one to become the king of thunder.</p><br/><p>It allowed the user to freely control metal and lightning, and even turn their body into lightning itself when fully mastered.</p><br/><p>He still had a long way to go on this path, but he could still easily control a few mere pieces of metal.</p><br/><p>\u2014cracklecrackle\u2014 </p><br/><p>Around his semi-formed lightning armor, seven circular metal orbs floated.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014tatatatatat!</p><br/><p>The orbs embedded themselves in a straight line between the spear and his armor.</p><br/><p>And soon\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014booooooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hs metal orbs and the spear collided.</p><br/><p>The black orb on the tip of the spear exploded and started to devour everything in the vicinity.</p><br/><p>\u2018Dammit! I knew this would happen!\u2019</p><br/><p>The spear and the metal orbs continued to clash against each other while emitting a tremendous amount of light into the surrounding area.</p><br/><p>Zeus grit his teeth as he continued to inject more and more energy into the metal orbs.</p><br/><p>\u2014kajajajak!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014crack!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The first three orbs were destroyed almost instantly.</p><br/><p>But starting from the fourth orb, the speed of the spear had started to slow down.</p><br/><p>And by the time the spear broke through the fifth and sixth orbs, it had already lost all its momentum.</p><br/><p>The spear smashed into the seventh and final orb, but could not go through it.</p><br/><p>And Zeus didn\u2019t miss this chance as he swung his towards Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u2014boom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Again, the spear and the dagger collided together again with a tremendous sound.</p><br/><p>\u2014pssss\u2014 </p><br/><p>Zeus made a content expression as he watched Hansoo being pushed back. The broken metal orbs turned back into powder and swirled around his body again.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Damn, that\u2019s strong. Did he just refine his attacking skill or something? These metal orbs aren\u2019t easy to make.\u2019</p><br/><p>Zeus frowned as he calculated the amount of metal left around his body.</p><br/><p>A single strike was all that was needed to go through almost half of his metal powder.</p><br/><p>Though it didn\u2019t seem like a lot, the amount of metal lost was what he\u2019d gained after three months of slaving away the adventurers who had lived near him.</p><br/><p>It was hard to get because the material for this metal belonged to the horns of the 8th-grade race, the . </p><br/><p>He wanted to beat up this new kid for a bit, but in the end he was the one who\u2019d lost out.</p><br/><p>\u2018Should I take him? We\u2019re lacking a bit of manpower these days.\u2019</p><br/><p>Though he didn\u2019t like any of his so-called \u2018allies\u2019, it was better to be friends with somebody powerful than being enemies with them.</p><br/><p>But Zeus decided not to after a while.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s just kill him. Or take him back half-dead.\u2019</p><br/><p>The fact that his group hadn\u2019t known about this person\u2019s existence up till now was a little disconcerting.</p><br/><p>And for some reason, he had an ominous feeling about this man.</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014 </p><br/><p>Zeus walked forward as he focused on the dagger in his hand.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014sssshhhss\u2014 </p><br/><p>The Roranoa powders started to align themselves onto the dagger.</p><br/><p>Soon the dagger, which was barely the length of two fingers or so, became a longsword over a meter long.</p><br/><p>\u2014kiiiiing!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014whoooosh!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Zeus swung his sword against the man who was charging towards him again.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ll\u2026smash you apart!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014zzzzzchchzzch!\u2014 </p><br/><p>From the previous collision, he figured out that he would be able to win.</p><br/><p>As long as he focused and used the Roranoa powders, he could easily defeat this man.</p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>His sword and the spear collided again as he created another loud noise.</p><br/><p>And as Zeus expected\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014c-c-crack\u2014 </p><br/><p>The silk-like reinforcement around the man started to make crackling noises as it began to crack apart.</p><br/><p>\u2018Good!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014crunch!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Zeus smirked as he continued to push the man.</p><br/><p>And he looked up to see the man\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>He wanted to see his expression of fear.</p><br/><p>\u2018How dare you lay a trap\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>But then\u2014 </p><br/><p>Zeus realized that something was terribly wrong.</p><br/><p>What he\u2019d seen was not a face stricken with fear.</p><br/><p>But rather a pair of cold, cold eyes staring back at him.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014booooooooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s spear withdrew as he pulled back his arm.</p><br/><p>\u2014boooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s left arm flashed out as it blocked Silveril\u2019s path.</p><br/><p>A small shield on his left hand had blocked it.</p><br/><p>And in that instant\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014boooom!\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2018The hell is this!?\u2019</p><br/><p>A yellow light exploded out from the man\u2019s shield and swept around their surroundings.</p><br/><p>And the power of lightning surrounding his body became noticeably weaker.</p><br/><p>pssss\u2026</p><br/><p>The Roranoa powders he\u2019d held in place with the lightning immediately dispersed as his Silveril turned back from a longsword to a dagger.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014clank!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Zeus barely managed to guard against the charging shield with Silveril, all while shouting at his back.</p><br/><p>Towards the Dark King behind him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastard!

We didn\u2019t get a chance to finish our conversation back then, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo raised his brows at the boy\u2019s sudden change in attitude.</p><br/><p>And it wasn\u2019t just his attitude alone.</p><br/><p>His posture, aura, and his eyes had all changed.</p><br/><p>Those eyes which he had previously seen on Jang Oh.</p><br/><p>Hansoo mumbled as he stared into those eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2018This boy inherited the soul fragment, huh?\u2019</p><br/><p>But even before Hansoo could finish his thoughts.</p><br/><p>Taehee, who was now in full control of the boy, smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, the situation is much more different now.\u2019</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014booooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The moment the stake swept through the air, the Seven Strands Spear which Hansoo had experienced in the past shot out instantly.</p><br/><p>\u2014boom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Though it was sent out in haste, the power behind it was not weak.</p><br/><p>The Seven Strands Spear charged towards him as it ripped the space apart.</p><br/><p>A power which could even cause the Dark King to become a pile of meat in an instant.</p><br/><p>\u2018As I suspected.\u2019</p><br/><p>There were no openings.</p><br/><p>Unlike the Dark King, who was basically playing around with random skills, or the boy, who had still been experienced, this person was dimensions apart.</p><br/><p>A skill that had been polished, over and over again.</p><br/><p>Hansoo smiled coldly as he looked at the seven-colored spear which had manifested for the sole sake of destruction.</p><br/><p>He had been hurt by this quite a lot in the past, but\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014now he had something very useful up his sleeves to counter it.</p><br/><p>Kirrrrrrik!</p><br/><p>He pumped out a few dragons from his heart, and they ran towards the tip of his spear.</p><br/><p>His heart continued to pump as it supplied every nook of his body with warm blood.</p><br/><p>He poured out waves of his mana, causing the mana jade to go into overdrive.</p><br/><p>And in the brief moment it took the Seven Strands Spear to reach Hansoo, four dragons had crawled up the spear and had condensed into a single point.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>The dark orb flew out.</p><br/><p>\u2014booooooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The seven-colored light and the dark orb collided, creating a huge shockwave.</p><br/><p>\u2014kudududuk\u2014 </p><br/><p>But soon, the black-colored orb smashed apart the seven-colored light as if it were trying to prove that it was the higher level skill, and almost instantly reached Taehee in control of the boy.</p><br/><p>\u2014swoooosh!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Though it had been weakened from the collision with the Seven Strands Spear, it was still more than enough to destroy a life.</p><br/><p>Even though anybody would freak out if they were to see such a powerful attack approach them, Taehee merely smiled.</p><br/><p>\u2014bubble bubble bubble\u2014 </p><br/><p>The area surrounding Taehee began to bubble.</p><br/><p>As if she was being covered in boiling water.</p><br/><p>The air and space itself bubbled up.</p><br/><p>Affecting Hansoo\u2019s attack as well.</p><br/><p>As Hansoo\u2019s black orb approached Taehee, it gradually started bubbling bit by bit.</p><br/><p>And as these two collided\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014booooooooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014another tremendous shockwave was let loose, shaking the entire perimeter of the place.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo frowned at the sight.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Elemental Outfit.\u201d</p><br/><p>A terrifyingly powerful skill which absorbed the surrounding elements to defend and attack.</p><br/><p>For skills at the level of Solo Numbering 1,2, and 3, there wasn\u2019t much difference of power between them and the Zero Numberings.</p><br/><p>To the point of being able to beat Zero Numberings if the Solo Numbering 1,2, and 3\u2019s masteries levels were higher.</p><br/><p>From what he could see, Taehee\u2019s mastery over this skill was miles and miles ahead of its limit.</p><br/><p>\u2018...The Witch. She was annoying in the past as well.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo shook his head as he looked at Taehee walking through the residue of the explosion.</p><br/><p>Though she had the look of a twenty-year-old boy, he could visualize the beauty who had fought so confidently in the past.</p><br/><p>A person who had terrifying potential and monstrous skills.</p><br/><p>With a personality that enjoyed battles.</p><br/><p>She would\u2019ve been a very good comrade if not for the fact that she had long been blinded by Clementine\u2019s vision, skills, and potential.</p><br/><p>To the point that she\u2019d been willing to offer up her own life.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, everyone who follows Clementine is like that\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Anyway, this would not end so quickly now.</p><br/><p>Since she wouldn\u2019t back down that easily.</p><br/><p>\u2014crackle\u2014 </p><br/><p>As Hansoo tightened his grip on Forked Lightning, Taehee walked out while wearing a colorful outfit that seemed to burn up her surroundings.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s been a while, so I didn\u2019t want to say goodbye this soon, but this is the end of our reunion it seems.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour actions and words contradict themselves, did you know that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Taehee smiled at Hansoo, who chuckled after seeing her body burn up even brighter.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not like you\u2019re going to just let me go, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo replied by gripping his spear even tighter.</p><br/><p>It was just as she\u2019d said.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know why she was trying to avoid a fight with him, which meant that this was important.</p><br/><p>And since letting them succeed in their plans wouldn\u2019t be good for him\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ll just\u2026break your legs right here!\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo smiled coldly.</p><br/><p>HIs strength was overflowing.</p><br/><p>Another step closer to his past life\u2019s original power.</p><br/><p>The four skills were roaring out from within him.</p><br/><p>Use us.</p><br/><p>Hurry and use us.</p><br/><p>Use us to crush your enemy.</p><br/><p>Prove you are superior.</p><br/><p>Taehee herself might be an issue, but he didn\u2019t plan on losing to someone being controlled by Taehee.</p><br/><p>\u2014boooooooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s spear and Rangkom\u2019s Stake collided, creating a huge shockwave.</p><br/><p>The shockwave continued to extend outwards.</p><br/><p>And soon it reached a creature that was rolling around the ground in pain.</p><br/><p>The Ark-Roa which was trying its best to suppress the Pandemic Blade.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014 </p><br/><p>The shockwave from the distance pricked its skin, but the Ark-Roa had no time to worry about such a thing.</p><br/><p>There was something much more important at stake.</p><br/><p>\u201cKrrkrrkr\u2026.Krrrk.\u201d</p><br/><p>The food it had just eaten was rotten beyond reason.</p><br/><p>The ones it had eaten were nothing more than empty husks because all their sources of mana had been devoured by these spores.</p><br/><p>It had devoured six, all of which had been filled to the brim with these spores.</p><br/><p>It hadn\u2019t gained much strength from them, and instead had just received a lot of pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh...Kuhuk.\u201d</p><br/><p>The pain hadn\u2019t reached the point of killing it, though.</p><br/><p>It was just a bit annoying.</p><br/><p>For something to give this much pain to itself\u2026 </p><br/><p>The Ark-Roa slowly suppressed the spores as its eyes filled with rage.</p><br/><p>Of course it wasn\u2019t acting according to its emotions.</p><br/><p>The shockwaves from the distance was telling it that this place wasn\u2019t safe.</p><br/><p>It needed to heal back up, it needed to evolve even more.</p><br/><p>It needed\u2026more food.</p><br/><p>Much, much more food.</p><br/><p>The Arc-Roa started to focus on its left arm.</p><br/><p>\u2014swoosh\u2014 </p><br/><p>The veins, muscles, and mana circuits started to crazily push the spores towards its body.</p><br/><p>The spores multiplied at an insane rate to devour its entire left arm, but as they moved, they soon realized that there was much more energy in the actual body.</p><br/><p>And after fully curing its left arm of the spear, the Ark-Roa used its right arm to cut its left arm off.</p><br/><p>\u2014crunch!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The Ark-Roa\u2019s left arm turned to mush as it fell down to the ground.</p><br/><p>\u2014squirm\u2014 </p><br/><p>There was no blood.</p><br/><p>Only a bit of life.</p><br/><p>Soon\u2014 </p><br/><p>Another left arm regenerated.</p><br/><p>And shockingly, the same thing was happening to its original left arm.</p><br/><p>\u2014wooosh\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014crunch\u2014 </p><br/><p>The left arm quickly grew larger and larger.</p><br/><p>It expanded into a giant, gruesome sphere, about the size of a man, but then started folding into itself.</p><br/><p>Grrrrr.</p><br/><p>A giant hunting dog came out as a result.</p><br/><p>Graaaaar!</p><br/><p>As its claws and teeth sprang out, it started to dash away with a roar.</p><br/><p>There was no point in giving it an order.</p><br/><p>The Ark-Roa was the dog, and the dog was the Ark-Roa.</p><br/><p>The Ark-Roa\u2019s true body smiled as it looked at the dog while it continued to suppress the spores.</p><br/><p>A clone of itself that was created just for the sake of devouring.</p><br/><p>Though it had only expanded a bit of strength since it needed to quickly suppress the spores, that dog would be more than enough to sweep apart the entire zone.</p><br/><p>Though the remaining beings were weak, once he devoured the millions alive, it would be of great help towards its next stage.</p><br/><p>Then he would eat them all.</p><br/><p>The ones from below who were going to come up.</p><br/><p>And the ones going up.</p><br/><p>And everything on the 7th floor as well.</p><br/><p>Then\u2026it would have the right to go back to where it had come from.</p><br/><p>But there was something it needed to do before that.</p><br/><p>Grrrr.</p><br/><p>As the Ark-Roa growled out while thinking of the weak, weak human beings who lived upon this land.</p><br/><p>\u2014boooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Something flew over and loudly landed next to it.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>A young boy\u2019s voice could be heard through the smoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 he really wasn\u2019t an easy opponent. Seriously.\u201d</p><br/><p>Taehee, who had cut through space to arrive here, smiled as she looked at her empty hand.</p><br/><p>She\u2019d been forced to throw away the stake and run away.</p><br/><p>And there wasn\u2019t much time left now, either.</p><br/><p>Since the one who had caused all of this would soon arrive.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ugh, I\u2019ll need to finish things up before then\u2026 but damn. He\u2019s really strong.\u2019</p><br/><p>Taehee shook her head as she thought of Hansoo.</p><br/><p>She had thought of herself as being quite strong, but it seemed like Hansoo was numerous levels above her.</p><br/><p>Although she would win if she brought her true body over since they were in different zones, that didn\u2019t even qualify as an excuse.</p><br/><p>Since she had come to this world twenty years prior to Hansoo.</p><br/><p>Taehee smiled bitterly and shook her head.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t like lingering on useless thoughts.</p><br/><p>She just needed to accomplish her objectives.</p><br/><p>Taehee then smiled towards the Ark-Roa in front of her.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, right? Since I sent you down here when you were an egg.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrrrrr\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Though it looked different, the aura was the same.</p><br/><p>The past.</p><br/><p>Ark-Roa grit its teeth as it saw one of the beings which had turned it to such a mess and had forced it to run away on the elevator.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

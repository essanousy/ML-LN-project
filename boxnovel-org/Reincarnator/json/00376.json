What\u2019s up? Try a bit harder!\u201d</p><br/><p>Elis Valentine laughed out loud as she charged towards Kiriel.</p><br/><p>Despite her laughter, she was bleeding from her entire body.</p><br/><p>Kiriel freaked out at the sight of Elis Valentine continuing to charge at her despite the countless wounds on her body.</p><br/><p>\u2018I knew she was crazy, but\u2026 she\u2019s just straight up mental.\u2019</p><br/><p>She realized that something was off with Elis\u2019s head when she saw her stabbing herself with that spike.</p><br/><p>But she didn\u2019t expect her to be this crazy.</p><br/><p>\u2014kiiiiiiiiiing!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Kiriel activated the Dragon God Armor to its limits as she attacked Elis Valentine again.</p><br/><p>\u2014clank!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Success.</p><br/><p>The fang in Kiriel\u2019s hand had cut enough flesh to reveal Elis Valentine\u2019s ribs.</p><br/><p>A wound that would cause people to freeze up in shock from the pain alone.</p><br/><p>But Kiriel didn\u2019t rejoice with this and instead hardened her muscles.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn it\u2026 Huup!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Elis Valentine\u2019s partially cut-off right hand smashed into Kiriel\u2019s stomach.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ugh!\u2019</p><br/><p>Kiriel breathed in deeply at the powerful force slamming her stomach, quickly regaining her balance as the blow flung her back.</p><br/><p>\u2014chiiiii\u2014 </p><br/><p>Kiriel dug her fingers into the ground, slowing herself from being flung backward.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tsk\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>And she frowned as Elis Valentine approached her again with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u2014ssss\u2014 </p><br/><p>The injuries on her body were healing at a visible pace.</p><br/><p>New skin grew, and her body reabsorbed the leaking blood.</p><br/><p>Broken bones mended and severed muscles healed.</p><br/><p>A monstrous healing ability.</p><br/><p>Even for a 3-Star Transcendent, it was abnormal.</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t at that level, not even close.</p><br/><p>Elis\u2019s spike had punctured her skin, and the wound was still bleeding.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Annoying.\u2019</p><br/><p>Kiriel frowned as she looked at the completely healed Elis.</p><br/><p>Elis made a creepy smile as if Kiriel\u2019s expression made her feel happy.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems you don\u2019t have a Trait designed for battle? So how is it? Seeing a battle-specialized Trait?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiriel shrugged.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, I\u2019m not really envious or anything. I\u2019m not insane like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rising to the 3-Star level had strengthened her Trait as well.</p><br/><p>Unlike before, where she had to focus to read memories, she could now read memories just by touching someone briefly during a fight.</p><br/><p>Elis\u2019s Trait was . </p><br/><p>She was resistant to pain.</p><br/><p>A human\u2019s natural defense mechanism to feel pain did not exist inside her.</p><br/><p>Actually, one could say it was more of a disorder than a Trait at this point.</p><br/><p>But of course, her Trait allowed her to take this to another level.</p><br/><p>She could save the pain she would otherwise feel and convert it into her own strength or even heal herself.</p><br/><p>A very useful Trait in a battle.</p><br/><p>A battle involved collective actions that put one through pain.</p><br/><p>Of course, the healing rate wasn\u2019t crazy to the point that she could heal everything.</p><br/><p>She was still losing out in the end.</p><br/><p>But since Elis was giving away a rib to cut a single piece of Kiriel\u2019s flesh, Kiriel was the one truly losing out in this battle.</p><br/><p>And another.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Damn. She wasn\u2019t poking her body around just for fun.\u2019</p><br/><p>Normally, she shouldn\u2019t be able to heal like that.</p><br/><p>Calculating the injuries Kiriel had given to Elis, there wasn\u2019t enough damage to heal her to this degree.</p><br/><p>But Elis had completely recovered.</p><br/><p>There was only one reason for this.</p><br/><p>She had saved up the pain with her Trait and waited.</p><br/><p>\u2018She\u2019s insanely efficient.\u2019</p><br/><p>She had accumulated her painful actions and used it to heal.</p><br/><p>With her natural healing abilities, the injuries from her spikes were more than enough for her to mend her wounds. </p><br/><p>And this was the result.</p><br/><p>A near immortal body.</p><br/><p>Elis giggled as she looked at Kiriel.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t misunderstand. The thing I was doing before is my hobby. I\u2019m not doing it because I need to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiriel was at a loss.</p><br/><p>\u2018This girl. She\u2019s really mental.\u2019</p><br/><p>Elis continued to speak, enjoying Kiriel\u2019s expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou see, I was in a lot of pain before I came here in the past. A lot of pain. So much pain that I\u2019d faint from it. But then it\u2019s funny because you wake up from the pain. Every day is a living nightmare.\u201d</p><br/><p>Later on, the medication stopped working as well.</p><br/><p>Struggling from pain day by day.</p><br/><p>She wanted to die, but they wouldn\u2019t let her.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut there was at least one good thing about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...What is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elis laughed as she replied:</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen I used all my effort to pretend not to be in pain, people looked at me with admiration in their eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>This had made her feel special.</p><br/><p>It was something that others couldn\u2019t do.</p><br/><p>Withstanding pain that others couldn\u2019t even imagine.</p><br/><p>Her body felt full of pain, but that one thing was good.</p><br/><p>And the Trait she had earned as she came over to this world\u2026 </p><br/><p>Pain Nullification.</p><br/><p>\u201cI really like this world. I don\u2019t hurt anymore. But unlike before, the people don\u2019t look at me the same anymore. So I started this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014stab\u2014 </p><br/><p>Kiriel watched as Elis stabbed herself again in a daze.</p><br/><p>And Elis looked at her expression and smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, that expression.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou crazy b****. These aren\u2019t the eyes of admiration but eyes that think you\u2019re f***ing insane.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elis shrugged her shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s all the same shit. They\u2019re all surprised by me, right? Anyway, come at me. You have to stop me, right? I need to finish this up and go over to my brother too. Remember, this whole place will blow up if you don\u2019t stop me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking tired, Kiriel mumbled:</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming, you crazy b****\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Her entire body was creaking with pain but thanks to their chat, she had healed to a certain degree.</p><br/><p>Kiriel stared at Elis and thought to herself:</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know what to do, Hansoo\u2026 she\u2019s more insane than I imagined.\u2019</p><br/><p>A crazy b**** could be dealt with if you beat them halfway to death, but she was also ridiculously strong.</p><br/><p>Kiriel looked at Elis with a bitter expression.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u2014boom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo frowned at the countless figures charging towards him.</p><br/><p>\u2018These aren\u2019t at a 3-Star level, but\u2026 for them to become this strong\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>The overflowing energy from the crystal.</p><br/><p>And the Dragon God Armor that used this energy.</p><br/><p>The modifications that pushed the body\u2019s efficiency to its limits.</p><br/><p>Melchizedek seemed to have taken it as a challenge to see how far one can push a 2-Star Transcendent. It had invested everything it had onto these Artificial Transcendents.</p><br/><p>And they were showing him their might.</p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s Mjolnir and the blade from the Dragon God Armor collided as a huge sound reverberated.</p><br/><p>\u2014tudududuk!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Of course, it couldn't withstand the strength of the 3-Star Transcendent Hansoo, so the blade had snapped.</p><br/><p>But the other Artificial Transcendents did not miss this chance.</p><br/><p>\u2014whoosh!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Two more attacks rushed in from the small gap created by the first Artificial Transcendent\u2019s collision with Hansoo.</p><br/><p>Including the one blocking his attacks, three Artificial Transcendents were raining attacks down on his body.</p><br/><p>Hansoo frowned at seeing these attacks closing in on him from all directions and then let down his guard.</p><br/><p>\u2014pushuk!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Three blades embedded themselves between the gaps of the blue armor.</p><br/><p>And as if they felt ecstasy from the succession of their attacks, they all smirked a little.</p><br/><p>A deep wound.</p><br/><p>No matter how strong Hansoo was, this was still fatal.</p><br/><p>One blade had even approached his heart.</p><br/><p>Any small movement could rob Hansoo of his life.</p><br/><p>But while the Artificial Transcendents were rejoicing, Hansoo voice called out:</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Melchizedek erased your emotions because they might interfere in battle.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo continued to speak as he looked at their confused expressions.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying, if you wish to rejoice then do it after everything\u2019s over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014boooooooooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014the hammer in Hansoo\u2019s hand swung through the air and smashed through their heads in quick succession.</p><br/><p>The Dragon God Armor and the overflowing energy of the crystal had tried to protect them, but it was all futile.</p><br/><p>The seven dragons that he\u2019d gathered while they stabbed him had sent all three heads flying away, one at a time.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u201cHaa...Haaa\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026ssssss\u2026</p><br/><p>Hansoo healed his injury with his Immortal Soul as he looked around.</p><br/><p>\u2018There\u2019s still a few more left?\u2019</p><br/><p>Since he was trying to finish things quickly, he\u2019d lost a significant amount of stamina.</p><br/><p>Even the Immortal Soul had a limit in healing wounds from the condensed mana\u2014it took a considerable amount of effort for it to fully heal these wounds.</p><br/><p>In a situation where he didn\u2019t know what Melchizedek was planning inside, he didn\u2019t have the leisure to be wasting his energy and stamina like this.</p><br/><p>Hansoo passed by the corpses of the ones he\u2019d killed off and quickly dashed further into the depths where he felt the crystal\u2019s aura.</p><br/><p>The aura was continuously expanding.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t look simple.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s see. Let\u2019s see what you have hidden.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014boom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo hastened towards the depths of Melchizedek\u2019s machine castle.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWho made that? That creature? Isn\u2019t it alive?\u201d</p><br/><p>N-Aroel shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way. Somebody created it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...It?\u201d</p><br/><p>Roaaaaaar! </p><br/><p>R-Koronaita Nell freaked out as he looked at the giant creature, Nelkipa, as it flew through space.</p><br/><p>\u2018That\u2026 Somebody made that?\u2019</p><br/><p>A body with defensive properties that was countless times more superior than their proud fleet of flames.</p><br/><p>Who had created that?</p><br/><p>For what reason?</p><br/><p>And as if N-Aroel had read R-Koronaita Nell\u2019s mind, he answered his thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is a warship. A warship created by a certain race.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...That\u2019s a warship?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not even active by the way. It\u2019s\u2026 just waking up?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>N-Aroel laughed at R-Koronaita Nell\u2019s dumbfounded expression and said:</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a warship. A ship designed for war. It\u2019s not supposed to float around like a jellyfish. If it started up properly\u2026 It\u2019ll be amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>N-Aroel then made an amused expression as he looked at the countless spikes on the Nelkipa\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut aren\u2019t you curious? As to how I know all this?\u201d</p><br/><p>R-Koronaita Nell\u2019s expression froze.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

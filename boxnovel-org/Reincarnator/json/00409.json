Even though we want to use it\u2026 The Miprosky-level weapons need authorization from the clans.\u201d</p><br/><p>Miprosky-level weapons were of a caliber powerful enough to render all defenses useless and cause a fatal level of destruction to their targets.</p><br/><p>Which meant that if they decided to use this on the monsters below, even the slightest mistake could cause catastrophic levels of destruction.</p><br/><p>This was why even the captains couldn\u2019t use it near the capital or any important structures.</p><br/><p>It was a weapon that couldn\u2019t be easily utilized even if one wanted to.</p><br/><p>R-Kailat Ron responded with annoyance.</p><br/><p>\u201c...I received their permission already.

Are you sure this is the right way?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!...Yes! Yes! Please just protect me!\u201d</p><br/><p>R-Zairon Nell frowned as he stared at N-Aroel struggling under his grip.</p><br/><p>\u2018Was he usually this talkative?\u2019</p><br/><p>I mean, he understood.</p><br/><p>The current situation wasn\u2019t the best one to keep oneself calm.</p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u201cAhh!\u201d</p><br/><p>N-Aroel freaked out again as a giant explosion occurred next to R-Zairon.</p><br/><p>The insectoids continued to swarm towards them from all directions.</p><br/><p>And they couldn\u2019t even see any of the 1st-level insects anymore.</p><br/><p>They were all 2nd or 3rd-level, and sometimes one or two 4th-levels came out.</p><br/><p>Basically, it was a field of insects.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhh!\u201d</p><br/><p>R-Zairon Nell ignored N-Aroel\u2019s screams, ripping apart a 3rd-level insectoid and looking around.</p><br/><p>He killed and killed and killed.</p><br/><p>But the numbers did not decrease.</p><br/><p>The speed at which the insects were filling up the place was actually faster than the soldiers\u2019 rate of killing.</p><br/><p>Monstrous breeding speed and powerful bodies.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuaa\u2026ahhhh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>R-Zairon Nell gritted his teeth as he watched his subordinates barely killing off a 4th-level insectoid.</p><br/><p>\u2018...We can barely kill one with five of us?\u2019</p><br/><p>R-Zairon Nell couldn\u2019t even imagine what would happen if these things fell onto the main planet.</p><br/><p>No matter how noisy this N-Aroel was, it was important that they needed to take him to the Quantum Transmission machine.</p><br/><p>They could just break it once they reached it, but according to what they\u2019d heard, its location was apparently the main lair for these guys.</p><br/><p>It was not someplace where they\u2019d crawl into willingly.</p><br/><p>\u2018...To walk in there by himself. A maniac.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014booom! boom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>R-Zairon Nell felt the shockwaves and explosive sounds in the distance and refocused his attention.</p><br/><p>He was thankful anyway.</p><br/><p>By charging into the insectoid\u2019s nest and attracting most of their attention, that male alien had diverted quite a large number of their forces.</p><br/><p>This was the only reason they had been able to push forward.</p><br/><p>If it weren\u2019t for that person in the distance, they would\u2019ve long since died.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it not done yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>A female\u2019s voice rang out, one that didn\u2019t quite fit the scene.</p><br/><p>But nobody could ignore her voice.</p><br/><p>\u2014crunch!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2018What the f***...\u2019</p><br/><p>One of the Dragon God Soldiers was at a loss.</p><br/><p>She\u2019d single-handedly killed a 4th-level insectoid that the five of them had barely been able to handle.</p><br/><p>With just her tiny stature.</p><br/><p>They had scoffed when they\u2019d initially talked about these aliens.</p><br/><p>Wondering how these barbarians could ever beat their advanced technology.</p><br/><p>But seeing her with their own eyes, they realized what the meaning of a \u2018monster\u2019 was.</p><br/><p>\u2018And\u2026 that girl is suspicious too.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014boom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The Dragon God Soldiers frowned at the woman hanging on the back of that woman called Kiriel.</p><br/><p>Although the aura coming from her body was very faint and was right on the verge of disappearing, they could sense it.</p><br/><p>That Kiriel and the woman on her back were the same types of creature.</p><br/><p>Meaning that as long as she could survive and heal, another monster like Kiriel would be born.</p><br/><p>Just like the one massacring the monsters before their eyes.</p><br/><p>No, like the one who had drawn the attention of the majority of these insects in the distance.</p><br/><p>\u2014smack!\u2014 </p><br/><p>R-Zairon Nell smashed away a Quirae charging at him and thought to himself:</p><br/><p>\u2018...Those things are too dangerous.\u2019</p><br/><p>Although these half-insect, half-humanoid creatures were monsters, that female who was ripping them apart with only her hands and a small dagger was no less of a monster.</p><br/><p>There was never an eternal ally or an opponent on the battlefield.</p><br/><p>Especially if the target was a barbarian like those things.</p><br/><p>\u2018I should prepare.\u2019</p><br/><p>R-Zairon Nell sent a message with his brain waves to N-Aroel.</p><br/><p>N-Aroel jolted at the sudden voice in his head but then moved his thumb as he felt the pressure of R-Zairon Nell\u2019s hand on his neck.</p><br/><p>If he didn\u2019t follow R-Zairon Nell\u2019s words, then his skull could get crushed at any moment.</p><br/><p>And with something like the Dragon God Armor, breaking his skull was no harder than crushing apart a block of tofu.</p><br/><p>\u2018Good.\u2019</p><br/><p>The moment N-Aroel responded, R-Zairon Nell started to dash and then sent another message.</p><br/><p>N-Aroel pondered for a bit at the question and then moved his second finger.</p><br/><p>\u2018Mmm\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>And R-Zairon Nell started to ponder when he saw this.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s making you so sad?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014boom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo mumbled, smashing apart a 4th-level Quirae.</p><br/><p>Their attacks had enough force to crack apart his blue armor.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo ignored the impact and swung his Mjolnir again.</p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Covered in the Nine Dragons Strike, the hammer smashed apart the Quirae\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>The Quirae\u2019s body stopped moving and fell to the ground.</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo frowned as he felt the Immortal Soul healing the damage he\u2019d received from the Quirae\u2019s attacks.</p><br/><p>\u2018Just a bit\u2026 just a bit more.\u2019</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t enough.</p><br/><p>His opponents were strong, yes.</p><br/><p>Since they were continuously causing damage to his body.</p><br/><p>The tide-like swarm of Quirae had been successful at causing damage to his body, but this wasn\u2019t enough.</p><br/><p>The declining rate of the Immortal Soul\u2019s growth proved this.</p><br/><p>The same level of stimulus and battle speed.</p><br/><p>Unlike a battle that required tension and strength, it was becoming more of a chore.</p><br/><p>As if the Immortal Soul was testing whether his stamina would run out or not.</p><br/><p>But this wasn\u2019t enough.</p><br/><p>With only this much stimulus, his stamina would actually run out before the Immortal Soul could successfully evolve.</p><br/><p>As a race that ruled over the 3rd floor of the Abyss, the insects\u2019 strength was quite substantial.</p><br/><p>But that strength was still limited.</p><br/><p>\u2018I should be thankful that they didn\u2019t eat the Abyssal beings when they grew up.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014boom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo continued to smash them apart and proceeded to his destination.</p><br/><p>Kiriel would deal with the transmission.</p><br/><p>But that was still just a part of the process as a whole.</p><br/><p>This place was a forge.</p><br/><p>A place that would temper their strength.</p><br/><p>And they had to become stronger.</p><br/><p>To solve everything above.</p><br/><p>And\u2026 there was a solution.</p><br/><p>Within the bodies of the ones charging at him, there were still traces of human genes.</p><br/><p>If they had devoured both humans and the owners of the blue armor, but still had faint auras of humans lingering within them, then that only meant one thing.</p><br/><p>That they hadn\u2019t finished their evolution.</p><br/><p>They hadn\u2019t been able to fully erase those traces of humans and thus bring the full potential of the genes from the owners of the blue armor.</p><br/><p>Since there was no need to keep behind the human\u2019s genes.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t sure before, but now he knew.</p><br/><p>The natives of the blue armor was a race that was countless times stronger than humans.</p><br/><p>So he knew.</p><br/><p>\u2018They exist.\u2019</p><br/><p>If there were this many 4th-level Quirae swarming around, he was sure that they were inside.</p><br/><p>Ones who had been successful in erasing the human genes and brought the genes of the stronger race to the limits.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know if they were currently evolving or if they just hadn\u2019t come out yet, but he was sure that they existed.</p><br/><p>And at that moment\u2014 </p><br/><p>He could hear the voice of the \u2019s original owner inside the seed in his head.</p><br/><p>Unlike the Pandemic Blade\u2019s talkative owner, this person had been silently watching him the whole time.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo didn\u2019t respond to the man\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>Since he didn\u2019t have a chance to.</p><br/><p>\u2014kachak!\u2014 </p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t because of the countless 3rd-level Quirae around him.</p><br/><p>Or the three 4th-level Quirae charging towards him.</p><br/><p>Within a short distance of 1km\u2014a mere few steps for a transcendent\u2014there was a bright, blue hole.</p><br/><p>Something was crawling out from it.</p><br/><p>With a valiant aura and a steady speed.</p><br/><p>Unlike the Quirae that were madly charging at him.</p><br/><p>That tremendous pressure pushed down onto Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cFound you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo mumbled as he looked at the being crawling out of the hole.</p><br/><p>A different form than the 4th-level Quirae, who were bulky and covered with thick armor.</p><br/><p>Although the Quirae had been the one to eat them, it had integrated so much with the owners of the blue armor that it looked just like them.</p><br/><p>The traits of the owners of the blue armor did not simply affect them internally but had even turned their outer appearance.</p><br/><p>Unlike the usual dark red shells, the gem-like blue armor on its body seemed made of beautiful crystals.</p><br/><p>And this being, instead of charging at him like the others, simply stared at him while maintaining the tense atmosphere.</p><br/><p>But of course, this didn\u2019t last long.</p><br/><p>\u2014boooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>A strange wave resonated out from Kiriel\u2019s direction.</p><br/><p>A wave that moved through the entire city.</p><br/><p>\u2018Did she arrive?\u2019</p><br/><p>And at that moment\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014as if they were having a final showdown before the arena disappeared, Hansoo and the bright blue creature collided.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

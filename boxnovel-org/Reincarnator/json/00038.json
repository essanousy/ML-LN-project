I won\u2019t take you with me but I won\u2019t stop you either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Taejin shook his head at those words.</p><br/><p>He wanted to follow him but he was not alone.</p><br/><p>They had gotten a little closer while fighting and because of this he had the opportunity to talk with him.</p><br/><p>And he could find out after talking to him for a while.</p><br/><p>There weren\u2019t many reasons why this guy was trying so hard to become strong.</p><br/><p>Just one.</p><br/><p>In order to go into more dangerous locations.</p><br/><p>His clansmen were strong too but if they were to follow him then they would die off in stroves.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t want to become strong that bad.</p><br/><p>The reason why he wanted to become strong was for the protection of the clan but that thing had different means and aim.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s a good choice.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo smiled as he looked at Taejin.</p><br/><p>Since the road which he will be traveling from now on will be even more dangerous.</p><br/><p>The things he needed to do in the Tutorial were two.</p><br/><p>Clearing the Final dungeon.</p><br/><p>And one more.</p><br/><p>\u2018A Dark Lord who is bound to be somewhere.\u2019</p><br/><p>Dark Lord.</p><br/><p>One of the guys he needed to pull out by the roots for the safety of humanity.</p><br/><p>Guys who were dangerous to no extent.</p><br/><p>No, the reason why they were so infamous was because they had the potential to be so dangerous from the start.</p><br/><p>There was one in this tutorial area too.</p><br/><p>\u2018I will clash with him properly\u2026 in the Tower.\u2019</p><br/><p>No matter where you are, you meet in the Tower.</p><br/><p>Since clashes were inevitable according to its structure.</p><br/><p>Hansoo muttered inwardly as he slowly walked inside the Demon Lord\u2019s Castle.</p><br/><p>The inner parts of the Demon Lord\u2019s Castle was empty.</p><br/><p>And a red colored crystal existed within the deep parts of the Demon Lord\u2019s Castle.</p><br/><p>\u2018It is not\u2026 working yet.\u2019</p><br/><p>The aura of the Crystal was too lacking to say it was working.</p><br/><p>And in front of that Crystal, in the large field which was enough to accommodate for the surviving thousand people, a statue which looked intimidating at a glance stood.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is that the Demon Lord?\u2019</p><br/><p>While the Clan Lords were frowning, Guktae approached from afar.</p><br/><p>Taejin frowned as he looked at him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Detestable bastard.\u2019</p><br/><p>But even so, he could only agree with his usefulness.</p><br/><p>Since his clan showed off the greatest might out of the ones here.</p><br/><p>Guktae approached the Clan Lords as he spoke:</p><br/><p>\u201cI have a suggestion. We have finally arrived at the final gateway together. It seems like the crystal would work if we break that statue apart.\u201d</p><br/><p>Guktae looked at the giant statue in the distance and then spoke to the Clan Lords.</p><br/><p>\u201cHonestly speaking all of us have seven to eight mini crystals right? This isn\u2019t a large number but it is more than enough to preserve our powers.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone nodded at those words.</p><br/><p>The amount of mini crystals differed from each other\u2019s contributions but it was a number which could at least take 40 of them up with them.</p><br/><p>If it was this much, it wasn\u2019t lacking to start anew in a new place.</p><br/><p>In a place where they could be in a very advantageous situation just by gathering up 10 people, there was nothing to even say about 40 of them.</p><br/><p>Since it was a very pressuring number to go against if they weren\u2019t Clan Lords like them.</p><br/><p>But Guktae threw out a very straightforward talk as he looked at them.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s speak really honestly. In my situation I want to kill off everyone else. It\u2019s probably the same for other friends too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Isn\u2019t that too honest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s put all in the open and speak.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone thought inwardly at those words.</p><br/><p>Even if they weren\u2019t that frank, rejoicing at the reduction of power of other clans was an obvious fact.</p><br/><p>Who would like a strong competitor in a world where the fairies were setting up tricks in order to get them to compete with each other.</p><br/><p>They might even have to kill each other as soon as they go up.</p><br/><p>And the other 11 clans were dangerous competitors and by the time they regret about fighting, it\u2019ll be too late.</p><br/><p>Everyone wanted it even if they weren\u2019t saying it as straightforward as he was.</p><br/><p>For the power of others to get reduced in the final battle.</p><br/><p>As Guktae saw the expression of a consensus from them, he added in some more words as extra.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t think we should do that. The reason why we have gotten here together despite hating each other so much was because we were on the same boat. We need each other that much. We need to combine our strengths in order to break through the gateway to ascend.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you want to say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Guktae laughed at Taejin\u2019s words as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery simple. Let us all reduce the risk and raise the chances of winning.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know that all of you have not exchanged all of your crystals into artifacts in case of emergencies. The same goes for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut think about it. How lame is this. If we just change our crystals into artifacts then the power of our Clan Unions rises by a huge amount. On the other hand, the crystals are an existence which just cut down our battle power even if we have it. Because you won\u2019t be able to fight properly as you never know when the guy next to you will attack your back and run away. If this were to happen then we could all die. A massacre.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Taejin thought inwardly.</p><br/><p>Guktae was a guy he didn\u2019t like but there was nothing wrong about what he had said.</p><br/><p>Honestly speaking, they had to convert all the crystals in their possession in order to face the giant statue, the Demon Lord, in front of them.</p><br/><p>Then the number of survivors would increase.</p><br/><p>But the reason why they held onto the crystals was because they felt uneasy.</p><br/><p>Since this crystal was a sure escape path.</p><br/><p>Gukgtae looked at them and shouted as he suggested.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo I have a suggestion. Let\u2019s all change the crystals we have into artifacts. Whichever artifact you change it to is however the user wants but let\u2019s use it all without a single one remaining.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhmm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHum\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a means to get rid of the escape path. Since we don\u2019t know what kind of crazily orders the Clan Lord will give after escaping if there\u2019s one left. Since there\u2019s probably somebody who thinks that it\u2019ll be a profit massacring the 1000 people here and surviving by himself.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. By the way, I\u2019m part of those guys. Can you trust in my clan like this and fight?\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t an impossible feat.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t know how strong that statue was but if 1000 of them had to fight with all their might, 100 people acting crazily would be extremely fatal.</p><br/><p>They could bury everyone here except the five who would escape with the mini crystal.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026too honest\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for the complement. On the other hand, if there wasn\u2019t a single crystal left in my hands then I couldn\u2019t do such a thing. Because that just means let\u2019s just all die. I don\u2019t want to die that way. If we all set our boundaries and have our clans fight in those areas with all their might then there will be no instances of being backstabbed. You just need to do your best on your defenses.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t somebody hide the crystals?\u201d</p><br/><p>Guktae shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t hide the crystals because we know the number of each other\u2019s crystals too well.</p><br/><p>Once we all agree let\u2019s buy and show each other. If we compare the number of crystals distributed and the cost of the items on the catalogue, you won\u2019t be able to hide the crystals even if you wanted to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone started to ponder at these words.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not like there were an uncountable amount of demons and because they had hunted them down employing their special forces together, the number of crystals were clear.</p><br/><p>A situation where they knew the number of crystals on each other very well because it was impossible to sneakily move around the special forces to hunt.</p><br/><p>According to those words then it was possible to know the total amount of crystals without a single one being left out.</p><br/><p>Honestly speaking, it was an obvious thing to decrease factors for anxiety and reinforce their battle strength as much as possible.</p><br/><p>Guktae added more words as he looked at these people.</p><br/><p>\u201cThink about it. Would the fairy have set the difficulty so that it wasn\u2019t possible to win? No matter how much fairy likes for us to die then they wouldn\u2019t have put in so much effort like this when they were going to kill us all. They could just simply kill us off and that\u2019ll be that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt means that that thing is possible if we all combine our strengths. Then it means a lot more can survive then you guys escaping with the mini crystals. If you all agree then I\u2019ll change first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone pondered at those words but then nodded.</p><br/><p>And they all started to buy artifacts one by one and showed each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m choosing the Thorn Wood Casket.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting the Ariadnea\u2019s Essence\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Guktae made a content expression as he checked them one by one.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019m choosing the Wilderness Lord\u2019s Cape. This costs 8 crystals. Everyone should know I received eight\u2026 Hansoo you had exactly 59, where did you use them all?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 59 of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone thought silently.</p><br/><p>If you include the Judgement of Dekrados he bought before then it totals to 119 crystals.</p><br/><p>They had known this but confirming it again made them amazed.</p><br/><p>Hansoo chuckled as he lifted and showed the dagger hanging onto his waist.</p><br/><p>\u201cI used it here. Justice of Dekrados.\u201d</p><br/><p>Guktae gazed at Hansoo dagger and then nodded with a content expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cThough four are left over\u2026 is there anything else you\u2019re going to buy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo pondered for a moment and then shook his head.</p><br/><p>Guktae chucked at that Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou probably don\u2019t have a reason to go up. Keep it well then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Well. You\u2019re probably here because you have an objective left.\u2019</p><br/><p>Guktae laughed inwardly.</p><br/><p>If he was somebody who would go up for his own safety then he would\u2019ve left already.</p><br/><p>The fact that he had stayed until now meant that he had something to do left.</p><br/><p>Anyways, if he decided to not fight and create a chaos or go up then nobody could stop him.</p><br/><p>It was better to just tell him to hold onto the escape path and fight actively.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell. There\u2019s not a single crystal left between the Clan Lords. We can finally focus on the enemy in front of us.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as Guktae\u2019s words ended, the giant statue squeaked as it raised its body.</p><br/><p>No, it was not a statue.</p><br/><p>It was like a living thing having been petrified like a statue.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s been a while huh.\u2019</p><br/><p>Demon Lord, Barbatoy.</p><br/><p>Though it was a weaker version, old memories sprung up when he saw the thing he had fought back then to death with after a long time.</p><br/><p>Though it wasn\u2019t a good memory.</p><br/><p>Just the number of humans who had died by getting ripped apart by his hands was easily over ten thousand.</p><br/><p>While Hansoo mumbled inwardly, Taejin shouted loudly at the Demon lord.</p><br/><p>\u201cNormal clansmen fall back and special forces, long range and those with healing skills\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A decision that had been laid because it could be a massacre if the normal clansmen, who couldn\u2019t even fight against the gatekeepers, got swept up in the fight against the Demon Lord.</p><br/><p>If they couldn\u2019t even fight against then they were not of help.</p><br/><p>But Taejin, who had been shouting, realized that this wasn\u2019t necessary.</p><br/><p>Since an enormous amount of undeads started to rise out of the ground in a crazy pace.</p><br/><p>\u201cGoddammit\u2026 Don\u2019t fall back and cover us instead!\u201d</p><br/><p>It looked like that they couldn\u2019t even get close to the Demon Lord without normal clansmen.</p><br/><p>And soon the undead charged ferociously and chaos was created.</p><br/><p>And at that moment the fairy appeared above their heads.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow! For one thousand people to have survived! Amazing! You just need to finish it off. First of all, the arrival point, even if you chose the same island, would be different from the mini-crystal to that of the giant crystal so you don\u2019t need to worry about getting revenged. Heehee.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It sounded like that they should attack from behind and leave without feeling any pressure since they didn\u2019t need to worry about being chased after running away with the mini crystal.</p><br/><p>But everyone snorted.</p><br/><p>Since they didn\u2019t have any mini crystals anymore.</p><br/><p>But the fairy\u2019s words did not end.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way, it isn\u2019t that the giant crystal turns on when you kill the Demon Lord!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt will turn on after 30 minutes. So you just need to survive until then right?\u201d</p><br/><p>The fairy disappeared with those words and everyone flinched.</p><br/><p>It was survival and not kill.</p><br/><p>Which meant the clan which fought the hardest would have the greatest loss.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s perfect. Really.\u2019</p><br/><p>And Guktae laughed as he looked at everyone flinching in the battlefield.</p><br/><p>Proofreader\u2019s Note</p><br/><p>Sometimes I just think that if Hansoo sacrificed just one of his slots for a not-so-good skill at the start, then everything else would be much easier.</p><br/><p>KobatoChan\u2019s Note</p><br/><p>The Reincarnator\u2019s \u201cRegular\u201d chapters are scheduled for the Wednesday, Friday, Sunday and/or Saturday.

I\u2019ll need to put some more rules down.\u2019</p><br/><p>They were doing this because they weren\u2019t in much of a hurry.</p><br/><p>Though it was chosen that the rules didn\u2019t exist, this was only within his own mind.</p><br/><p>Though the ones below would be full of discontentment.</p><br/><p>\u2018That\u2019s why you should\u2019ve done well by yourselves. Good. First of all, let\u2019s rip off the limbs of those who haven\u2019t been even able to touch the treasures\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>The moment Dakidus pondered and smiled as he was about to change the rules a bit, his ears twitched.</p><br/><p>\u2018Huh?\u2019</p><br/><p>Dakidus\u2019 eyes moved towards the Armory.</p><br/><p>A location where they stored quite a few rare toys.</p><br/><p>Then Dakidus smiled as he looked at that location.</p><br/><p>\u2018Oh this is going to get fun.\u2019</p><br/><p>Dakidus looked at the ones below with an amused expression.</p><br/><p>Nothing could escape his eyes and ears within this village.</p><br/><p>But of course his eyes would be attracted to the amusing thing.</p><br/><p>\u2018That kid went after the treasures at first but now is aiming for the Armory. Must be quite a greedy fellow.\u2019</p><br/><p>A very realistic person.</p><br/><p>He liked those types a lot.</p><br/><p>Dakidus looked at the guy named Hansoo in amusement.</p><br/><p>His nose gaped and ears twitched.</p><br/><p>\u2018Shall I get a bit closer to watch.\u2019</p><br/><p>While he could watch and hear from where he was, this wasn\u2019t really himself watching but rather him getting the intel from the Satellite Fortress.</p><br/><p>It was a bit inferior to directly hearing and seeing things.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yeah, you need to get up close for a show like this.\u2019</p><br/><p>A fight between the strongest bugs against the greedy and smart bugs.</p><br/><p>What else would he watch in this current situation?</p><br/><p>As Dakidus willed.</p><br/><p>Dakidus, who was shining with blue light, cut through the village and moved towards the air above the Armory.</p><br/><p>\u201cUhhh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hellum, who had acquired a single treasure along with a large amount of Hunters and was traveling towards the center of the village, suddenly made a confused expression as he saw Dakidus moving.</p><br/><p>Where would they take the treasure to if Dakidus moved like that?</p><br/><p>And Dakidus, with his blue crown, made an awkward expression.</p><br/><p>\u2018Oh right. I should finish up the treasure hunt now as well.\u2019</p><br/><p>He had forgotten about it since the situation over by the Armory was extremely amusing.</p><br/><p>But the solution was quite simple.</p><br/><p>Since the important part was getting the treasure to him.</p><br/><p>Dakidus shouted out loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m changing the rules.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBring the treasure to where I am. I will be at the Armory.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hellum and the other guards flinched.</p><br/><p>Since they knew what would be over there by now.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ekidu\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Hellum was a Hunter from the 5th area when Ekidu\u2019s massacre had started and had watched it all.</p><br/><p>But for them to have to go there now.</p><br/><p>Of course they were a bit reluctant to.</p><br/><p>But Hellum clenched his teeth.</p><br/><p>\u2018Since things happened as they did. Let\u2019s take it to the end.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was better to mess things up hard than to just do things half-heartedly.</p><br/><p>If everyone like him, the ones carrying the treasures, caused a ruckus then even Ekidu wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything.</p><br/><p>Since the chaos would\u2019ve been far above what Ekidu could handle.</p><br/><p>Hellum shouted towards the nearby Hunters.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go! Our goal has just changed a bit!\u201d</p><br/><p>Soon the 100 treasures and the people carrying those treasures jumped across the walls, past the buildings and started to head towards the Armory.</p><br/><p>Like a swarm of ants moving towards a giant piece of candy.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>The disappointment was as big as she had hoped.</p><br/><p>Ekidu heard the sound of Dakidus approaching her from the distance and stared at Hansoo expressionlessly.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026You know that you are the one who caused all of this right. Kang Hansoo?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was now out of control.</p><br/><p>Soon the Armory will fall into chaos.</p><br/><p>Due to the thousands of Hunters coming here with the treasures as well as the ones with Hansoo.</p><br/><p>Ekidu thought of the event in the past.</p><br/><p>When she hadn\u2019t been able to find the village and had barely arrived at the village after having lost 17 people.</p><br/><p>The village had a lot of benefits a but also a lot of problems.</p><br/><p>But it was still important.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yeah. This\u2026This is the Oasis.\u2019</p><br/><p>Even if everyone fought each other to acquire water, the Oasis was still needed.</p><br/><p>The rules of the village and the stocked items gave the humans the power to survive on.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ll protect it no matter what.\u2019</p><br/><p>That was what the village was like to her.</p><br/><p>And she needed to redevelop the village back to its beginning with a tremendous amount of strength in order to defend the village.</p><br/><p>\u2018I didn\u2019t want to use it\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Ekidu didn\u2019t use her strength often.</p><br/><p>But since it has come down to this.</p><br/><p>She needed to show it.</p><br/><p>As to what happened to those who threatened the village.</p><br/><p>Crackle.</p><br/><p>Ekidu\u2019s entire body started to get covered by a bright white flame.</p><br/><p>At the same time the iris that covered most of her eyes got smaller and smaller as if it was getting replaced by white.</p><br/><p>Deadly White Eyes.</p><br/><p>Something that happened when the whites of the eyes covered the black parts entirely.</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded as he saw this.</p><br/><p>That aura and that mana.</p><br/><p>As well as the special skill that devoured the user\u2019s consciousness.</p><br/><p>\u2018Triple Numbering.\u2019</p><br/><p>That was quite a high-ranking skill.</p><br/><p>Since Hansoo remembered it.</p><br/><p>\u2018312th rank. White River Demonic Art.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was white and pure.</p><br/><p>But this made it even more fearsome.</p><br/><p>Since that white was not a color of peace.</p><br/><p>It was a crazy demonic art that ate up all of one\u2019s emotions that would get in the way of combat once it was activated.</p><br/><p>This was why the White River Demonic Art\u2019s symbolic color was the color white.</p><br/><p>Since it turned one\u2019s mind white.</p><br/><p>They would cause destruction until they wake.</p><br/><p>Until everything they had enmity against was erased.</p><br/><p>The fight would only end if the enemy died or the user died themselves.</p><br/><p>\u2018That was why she tried to avoid fighting huh.\u2019</p><br/><p>Crack. Crackle.</p><br/><p>Karhal flinched at the sight of Ekidu, who was slowly approaching them while looking at her entire surroundings with the remaining whites of the eyes, and spoke to Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cYo\u2026Do you even have a way of dealing with that?\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>Swish.</p><br/><p>Ekidu\u2019s body suddenly disappeared in the distance.</p><br/><p>In an instant.</p><br/><p>Boooooom!</p><br/><p>Ekidu appeared right in front of Hansoo and then stretched out her legs.</p><br/><p>Swoosh</p><br/><p>The moment Ekidu\u2019s left kick cut through the air and touched Hansoo.</p><br/><p>Booooooooom!</p><br/><p>A huge explosive sound was made as it rumbled their surroundings.</p><br/><p>Crackle</p><br/><p>The Forked Lightning bent to the point of almost being folded.</p><br/><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><br/><p>Hansoo got sent back after smashing through three buildings and then slowly stood up as he watched Ekidu charging at him with a furious aura.</p><br/><p>\u2018I guess I\u2019ll die if I don\u2019t use it.\u2019</p><br/><p>Ekidu\u2019s level was above his expectations.</p><br/><p>In just an instant.</p><br/><p>Kuuududududuk</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s entire body got surrounded by scales.</p><br/><p>And his already beefy muscles ballooned up even more.</p><br/><p>Thump Thump Thump Thump</p><br/><p>The three hearts constantly pumped as they started to send the dragon\u2019s blood throughout his body.</p><br/><p>Hansoo then swung the Forked Lightning.</p><br/><p>Towards Ekidu who was flying towards him.</p><br/><p>In an instant.</p><br/><p>Booooom!</p><br/><p>Another huge explosive sound was created from Hansoo and Ekidu\u2019s collision.</p><br/><p>At the same time all the buildings nearby got smashed apart and started to crumble.</p><br/><p>Just from two clashes.</p><br/><p>Karhal swirled his tongue around as he saw this scene.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026For him to be able to fight with Ekidu.\u2019</p><br/><p>A skill he didn\u2019t use when he fought with them.</p><br/><p>For him to be able to go through a Racial Metamorphosis.</p><br/><p>He seemed confident but for him to be hiding such a thing.</p><br/><p>But Karhal realized that he wasn\u2019t really in the situation to leisure around.</p><br/><p>Since the most powerful guards in the village, the ones guarding the Armory, had started to attack him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn!\u201d</p><br/><p>Boooooom!</p><br/><p>Booom!</p><br/><p>Soon the surrounding areas around the Armory got filled up with explosive sounds.</p><br/><p>\u2018Good. Very good.\u2019</p><br/><p>Dakidus\u2019s body got more and more closer towards the ground as he saw this scene.</p><br/><p>Since being closer was better to see things more clearly.</p><br/><p>Booom! Booooom!</p><br/><p>A few pieces from the skills flung around to him but they all got disintegrated by the blue barrier surrounding him.</p><br/><p>While Dakidus was looking at the fight with an amused expression.</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>The walls blew apart as some other people entered the battlefield.</p><br/><p>Hellum and the Hunters who were participating in the Treasure Hunt.</p><br/><p>They had been able to reach the Armory first because they had started from where Hansoo was.</p><br/><p>Hellum took a glance at the chaos happening around him and then urgently shouted upwards.</p><br/><p>\u201cO Dakidus! We have come! With the treasure!\u201d</p><br/><p>Dakidus looked at Hellum and then made a bored expression.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t really like it when a guy, who hadn\u2019t even shown him what he wanted to see, came to ask for power.</p><br/><p>But a promise was a promise.</p><br/><p>Dakidus spoke out.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. What kind of wish do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Hunters behind Hellum all stopped at Dakidus\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>They had rushed over here in a hurry but hadn\u2019t really thought about what kind of wish they should ask for.</p><br/><p>\u2018Not enough intel.\u2019</p><br/><p>And they didn\u2019t know as to how far Dakidus will fulfill their wishes.</p><br/><p>But while others were pondering.</p><br/><p>Hellum did not, even for a moment.</p><br/><p>Since he had thought of something the moment he heard the goal had changed to the Armory.</p><br/><p>Hellum shouted loudly to Dakidus.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease make me invincible!\u201d</p><br/><p>Dakidus\u2019s expression changed.</p><br/><p>From a bored one to an impressed one.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, everyone behind you?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Dakidus looked at him in amusement, Hellum laughed coldly and replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, just me. And it doesn\u2019t have to be long.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hellum\u2019s expression was full of confidence.</p><br/><p>Since that Dakidus guy, who loved chaos and destruction, would definitely know what he was planning.</p><br/><p>He would definitely fulfill his wishes.</p><br/><p>And as he expected.</p><br/><p>Dakidus laughed coldly as he answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cSure. It shall be done. Except, it won\u2019t be fun if it lasts too long so\u2026The limit is 30 minutes.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the next instant.</p><br/><p>Swoooosh</p><br/><p>Hellum\u2019s entire body got covered by the blue barrier.</p><br/><p>Just like the barrier around Dakidus\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Hellum laughed coldy as he looked at the blue shields around him.</p><br/><p>\u201c30 Minutes. More than enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Hunters grinded their teeth as they saw this.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastard\u2026What are you trying to do. Are you trying to get to the end of the green road in 30 minutes or something?\u201d</p><br/><p>30 minutes.</p><br/><p>It was too short to really do anything.</p><br/><p>For him throw away such an important wish.</p><br/><p>Hellum shrugged his shoulders at the Hunter\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, at first i was going to ask for an artifact or a skill. But\u2026I don\u2019t really think I need to go that far to get those things?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hellum then looked towards the Armory.</p><br/><p>\u2018Even if I asked for an Artifact or a skill\u2026 It\u2019s Highly likely that Dakidus would just throw it away here due to his personality.\u2019</p><br/><p>A person with a good artifact getting beaten up to the death.</p><br/><p>This was the thing Dakidus wanted to see.</p><br/><p>Of course he wouldn\u2019t send people to the end of the Green Road.</p><br/><p>But this wish was different.</p><br/><p>Since he was planning to show Dakidus the exact thing he wanted to see.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018And without this I feel like I\u2019ll get killed by the crazy Ekidu.\u2019</p><br/><p>But it was now all over.</p><br/><p>He just needed to brush him off and walk out.</p><br/><p>Since nobody would have the strength to chase him down after the whole village becomes a mess.</p><br/><p>\u2018And\u2026There are plenty of Runes around here.</p><br/><p>Hellum smirked as he started to attack the Hunters who had followed him.</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>\u201cAaaaaa! This bastard, for real!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRun!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Hunters attacked a few times, realized that none of their attacks worked like how Dakidus had said, and had all separated and started to run away.</p><br/><p>The Guards were much stronger than the Hunters.</p><br/><p>And even more so now since he didn\u2019t really have to worry about retaliation from them.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahahhahaha! Where are you going!?\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Hellum was about to chase them after laughing out loudly.</p><br/><p>Boooooom!</p><br/><p>A tremendous amount of destructive force came out from the corner of the Armory.</p><br/><p>Hellum was shocked by this and looked towards the origin of this noise.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ekidu. Kang Hansoo.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hellum grinded his teeth after seeing the traces of great destruction caused by Ekidu and Hansoo in the distance.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026What the hell did these guys shove down their throats to have become that strong?\u2019</p><br/><p>Just as jealousy filled the entire mind of Hellum, his head rotated around quickly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yeah\u2026I can always get runes anywhere.\u2019</p><br/><p>But the unique items around Hansoo\u2019s body?</p><br/><p>And the White River Demonic Art that allowed Ekidu to turn into a crazy wargod?</p><br/><p>Those things would be extremely hard to find even within the Armory or from Dakidus.</p><br/><p>\u2018I must eat those.\u2019</p><br/><p>He wouldn\u2019t even dare to get between those two.</p><br/><p>But he was invincible currently.</p><br/><p>He needed to use these 30 minutes wisely.</p><br/><p>And the others participants who had found the treasures were also approaching towards this direction.</p><br/><p>They might ask for a similar wish as him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahahahaha! Let me butt in here as well!\u201d</p><br/><p>Booooom!</p><br/><p>As Hellum laughed out loudly and was about to jump towards Hansoo and Ekidu.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo, who had been looking around his surroundings calmy in the middle of the fight, suddenly nodded.</p><br/><p>\u2018If it\u2019s this much then\u2026 Everyone in the village should\u2019ve gathered.\u2019</p><br/><p>Most of the useful actors of this play had gathered</p><br/><p>And the fans for these people had gathered as well.</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked at Dakidus, who had come down to the point where he could stretch his arms and touch, and laughed coldly.</p><br/><p>He had at first thought of using a treasure to get closer.</p><br/><p>Since the might of the Sealing jade was better the closer they were.</p><br/><p>But if the opponent came closer to him on their own accord then there wasn\u2019t a need for him to go closer.</p><br/><p>\u201cInstead of just watching, you should join as well. Dakidus.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018The reinforcement has already finished a long time ago.\u2019</p><br/><p>Since he had long emptied the markets where the Guards had disappeared from on the way here.</p><br/><p>The moment Hansoo grasped the Sealing Jade in his pockets tightly.</p><br/><p>Hoooooong!</p><br/><p>A tremendous amount of vibration that couldn\u2019t even be compared to that from the darkness had swept through the village.</p><br/><p>\u201cUuuk?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hellum freaked out as he saw the blue barrier around him melt down.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

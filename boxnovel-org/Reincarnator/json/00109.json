It\u2019s good right? You\u2019ll become a nice opponent after you come out from there. Let\u2019s have a go at it after.\u201d</p><br/><p>The liquid shut out most perception from the outside.</p><br/><p>But Taruhol\u2019s shout which was filled with a crushing aura was so loud to the point where it could be heard from the inside.</p><br/><p>Hansoo smiled faintly at Taruhol\u2019s shouting as he opened and closed his mouth,</p><br/><p>\u2018Alright. But only after I do what I need to.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo felt the currents roaring up and down his body as he quietly closed his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Kurunkrung0</p><br/><p>Mirian looked at the red gem they had hidden deep within their living quarters with a complex expression but then quickly hid it as she felt someone nearing them.</p><br/><p>Mirian remembered the words they had left behind as she made herself more resolute.</p><br/><p>Soon Ailen appeared and then spoke to them.</p><br/><p>\u201cLiving. Is it okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tares made a complex expression as he replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good. Anyways, is your body alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ailen nodded as she spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you. Once you get strong. Blessing. I will make them. Debt. Must repay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tares felt like his chest was being stabbed apart but he stayed resolute.</p><br/><p>The priestess who seemed like their boss seemed to hate them extremely.</p><br/><p>No, it seemed like she despised all humans.</p><br/><p>They wouldn\u2019t be able to flip the Priestess\u2019s decision even if Ailen were to be on their side.</p><br/><p>\u2018In the end\u2026 You can\u2019t do anything without strength.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tares made a bitter expression.</p><br/><p>He wanted to go past the differences in races but this was not something that could be done by himself.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t matter since Hansoo seemed to be of importance to them but people like them were useless to the Priestess.</p><br/><p>If the priestess decided to keep their mouths shut then they will end their lives in this place without being able to leave.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yeah. The only thing we can trust\u2026 is humans.\u2019</p><br/><p>And they had said it too.</p><br/><p>That they won\u2019t kill.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026These guys will run away too.\u2019</p><br/><p>The things here were strong.</p><br/><p>Since one could see just from the five next to the Priestess.</p><br/><p>But their numbers were too small and it seemed like the people who could actually fight seemed to be limited, on the other hand the people who would be invading are people who had gotten strong over 5 to 6 years while murdering like it was their job.</p><br/><p>Just from the fact that the Akarons didn\u2019t act around in the Gragos showed which side had more strength.</p><br/><p>If they sense the difference in strength then they will run away.</p><br/><p>During this time when Tares and the others were comforting themselves.</p><br/><p>Booobooboom!</p><br/><p>A huge shockwave was heard as it shook the entire cave</p><br/><p>\u201cUhh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018They\u2019re here.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tares and the other people followed the surprised Ailen as they looked at the celing.</p><br/><p>And they could see.</p><br/><p>The scene of the ceiling, where countless gems were embedded like stars, falling down.</p><br/><p>And thousands of people started to pour down from that spot.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Plop</p><br/><p>Tares and the others attacked Ailen from behind and got her unconscious when she tried to look behind her.</p><br/><p>Since the Akarons would definitely figure out who had caused this.</p><br/><p>They needed to join up with the people up there before that.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t kill off Ailen as they left her unconscious and started to run towards them.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Oteon shouted towards the suddenly exploded ceiling.</p><br/><p>Taruhol and the four quickly checked upon the situation at those words.</p><br/><p>Their extremely honed perception started to gather up the information from all around the cave.</p><br/><p>But this current situation wasn\u2019t hard to figure out even without amazing perceptions.</p><br/><p>\u2018They\u2019re pouring in like crazy.\u2019</p><br/><p>The first pillar, Taruhol, clenched his teeth.</p><br/><p>The people he sensed were easily over 3000.</p><br/><p>The problem was that they didn\u2019t have anyone useless.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026There\u2019s at least four or more people who are at our level.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cThose bastard! To hit us from the back! I\u2019m going to rip these guys apart!\u201d</p><br/><p>The fourth pillar cried out loudly.</p><br/><p>Their cave, which hadn\u2019t been found out yet, had been found out.</p><br/><p>The moment the humans came in.</p><br/><p>The four pillar\u2019s movements of running up to the temple to rip the two humans receiving the body enhancement surgery had been blocked by Taruhol\u2019s suppression.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop. Why would they ask for the surgery if they weren\u2019t retards in such a situation?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the other ones.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamnit.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fourth pillar growled and then looked towards Oteon and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cPriestess. What are you going to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Oteon made a cold expression from those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need to escape. Please buy some time with the high and mid level warriors. I will try to get the seeds, escape this place and prepare for the movement.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026We shall.\u201d</p><br/><p>The strong had the responsibility to protect their race and the priestess in times of danger.</p><br/><p>And the priestess had the responsibility to lead their clan and sustain their survival.</p><br/><p>The moment they started to move after finishing off their strategy, the walls of the cave started to petrify.</p><br/><p>Chuujujujuk</p><br/><p>Though it was called a cave, it was still the insides of the Gragos.</p><br/><p>Oteon\u2019s expression hardened up as she saw the emergency exit he wanted to escape through the currents in it turned into rocks.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Oteon clenched her teeth as she saw the yellow metal, , that the people dropping down were throwing.</p><br/><p>One of the four substances that could influence the Gragos.</p><br/><p>The moment the flesh of the Gragos touched that metal, the flesh would instantly petrify and turn stiff.</p><br/><p>Kurururu</p><br/><p>The Defensive Stones were rushing over from all around but they couldn\u2019t come in as if it was hard to get through the petrified walls.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026They prepared well huh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Taruhol froze his expression as he saw the four people slowly walking towards them from the distance.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018Well. There\u2019s no need to rush since we trapped them in.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take care of the ones over there! You guys go get the children first!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the four Margoth-level adventurers smiled at Tares as he shouted towards the Baladi levels behind him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHooo. Thank you. It\u2019s all thanks to you. I\u2019ll make sure I keep the promise.\u201d</p><br/><p>But Tares\u2019 expression hardened as he heard the conversation.</p><br/><p>The story was different.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you\u2019ll let them run away! Why are you going this far! Isn\u2019t this too much?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tares clenched his teeth.</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t it enough to ask them with a few hostages for the body enhancement surgery?</p><br/><p>Why were they pushing them to the corner and taking all the younger ones as hostage?</p><br/><p>The man shrugged his shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry. I lied a bit since your personality wouldn\u2019t allow us to do so. It\u2019s too wasteful to kill them or let them run away.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was an Akaron warrior that they had caught before.</p><br/><p>The Akaron warrior that they had around gave them information the moment they threatened the kids.</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t find out the location of the Temple due to the limitations but they learned about their race\u2019s specialty.</p><br/><p>The greatest catch was the fact that they cherished children extremely.</p><br/><p>This was why they went for the children first.</p><br/><p>\u2018Which means we can get these guys to fight instead of us.\u2019</p><br/><p>The man, who had been frowning at the crazy people of the Rerorerore clan, smiled as he looked at the beast-like man from the other race in the distance.</p><br/><p>If they were to get these 5 in the front then they could grind apart the Rerorerore clan no matter what.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t matter even if they ignored the children and attacked them.</p><br/><p>Since the fact that they had found the location of the Body Enhancement surgery alone was amazing.</p><br/><p>As Tares made a dumbfounded expression of despair the female standing next to the man growled at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastard. Why are you acting as if you\u2019re the only kind person? You think we\u2019re doing this because we want to?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA lion might seem invincible to a fox like you but it\u2019s tiring for us too. You think you are the only one who has worries?\u201d</p><br/><p>No, the lions even have to keep their pride unlike the foxes.</p><br/><p>So it was even harder.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually we get scared every time we see it. Your gathering thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook. You get rid of the strong people whenever you get the chance. We\u2019re at least a different race. You bastards. Isn\u2019t was you\u2019re doing a racial cleansing?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was scary but there was a reason why the strong allowed the gatherings.</p><br/><p>It was a stimulant.</p><br/><p>If one gets strong and leisurely they will get lazy.</p><br/><p>This was why they allowed gatherings in order for them to constantly polish and sharpen themselves.</p><br/><p>While seeing the end of those who had lazed about below.</p><br/><p>The female, who had gotten worked up from the sensation of battle, shook her head as she spoke towards Tares.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve gotten too worked up. Sorry. Just go hide in the corner until we finish.\u201d</p><br/><p>Though she spoke like this, the battle wouldn\u2019t be easy.</p><br/><p>\u2018But we will still win\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>The female got rid of her nervousness as she shouted loudly towards the 5 Akarons in the distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are you trying to run off too? We\u2019ve prepared quite well for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then the female spun around the necklace in her hand.</p><br/><p>Taruhol\u2019s expression froze up as he saw this.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Kalum.\u201d</p><br/><p>The necklace of Kalum, a warrior who had gone missing while going out for a patrol 6 months ago.</p><br/><p>And a few of them were purposely turning around and aiming for the children.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese bastards!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment the 5 pillars took a step forward, brilliant lights of skills exploded out from the female and the other four.</p><br/><p>At the same time the countless amounts of Akarons and and clansmen started following the example of their leaders.</p><br/><p>\u201cUwaaaaa!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWipe them out!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kwaajijik</p><br/><p>Udududk</p><br/><p>A crazy scene of massacre started.</p><br/><p>The Akarons showed a tremendous battle prowess while fighting desperately in order to save their race and the humans forgot the idea of keeping them alive to use them as soldiers and instead also fought with all their strength.</p><br/><p>It might\u2019ve been different if one side was stronger but the injuries on both sides started to pile up quickly as the total strength of both sides were quite similar.</p><br/><p>But it was clear as to which side was winning.</p><br/><p>The physique of Akraons were basically like monsters but they had weak offensive powers.</p><br/><p>Like only having a close ranged tanker in a game.</p><br/><p>They were slowly getting pushed back by the humans who were assaulting them with various skills from a distance.</p><br/><p>And the Akarons also had a fatal weakness, the children.</p><br/><p>\u2018This\u2026 This isn\u2019t how it should be.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tares made an expression of his soul escaping while looking at the massacre in front of him.</p><br/><p>This was not what he had imagined.</p><br/><p>Tares, who had been staring at the battlefield in a daze, clenched his teeth and started to madly rush somewhere.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>Tares looked at the giant empty tower-like temple for a bit and then ran inside.</p><br/><p>He then looked towards the giant silver tank on the insides of the temple and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cHansoo! Please! We need you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tares had reached the point where he couldn\u2019t even understand himself.</p><br/><p>The powers of those who had come in was something not a single person could change.</p><br/><p>It would be hard to flip the tables even if Hansoo were to come out.</p><br/><p>But the moment he thought of helping the Akarons, Hansoo came into his mind.</p><br/><p>This was why he had ran here.</p><br/><p>Tares slammed his fists onto the calm silvery tank as he shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease! Please!\u201d</p><br/><p>But the tank only did what it was supposed to and stayed calm, nothing changed.</p><br/><p>Tares made an expression of despair after smashing the wall as much as he could and then crumpled onto the sot.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yeah. There\u2019s no reason why he would come out.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo could just stand on the side of the humans.</p><br/><p>Why would be become the enemy of the humans.</p><br/><p>At that moment the silver tank started to bubble as a human shape came up from it.</p><br/><p>Tares looked at the man who had come up with an expression of disbelief and then shouted out in glee.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou came out!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tares flinched the moment he saw Hansoo.</p><br/><p>Though Hansoo had been strong before his body wasn\u2019t top notch.</p><br/><p>Since one\u2019s body didn\u2019t get stronger even if one worked out in this world.</p><br/><p>Which meant that his body was that of a normal human being just like when he had come into this world.</p><br/><p>No, it was worse than a normal human\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Since he was extremely scrawny.</p><br/><p>But the Hansoo who had come out was completely different.</p><br/><p>His height reached over 2m and his body was full of muscles that seemed like they would explode.</p><br/><p>The moment Tares froze from the intense aura, Hansoo focused his perception to check the battlefield and then sighed.</p><br/><p>\u2018There aren\u2019t any calm ones left anymore\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going ahead.\u201d</p><br/><p>Booom!</p><br/><p>Hansoo, who had taken the gear which was next to the tank, started to run towards the battlefield at a speed which couldn\u2019t even be compared to before.</p><br/><p>Boom! Boom!</p><br/><p>Tares looked at the ground which seemed like it went through an earthquake in a daze and then started to run towards the battlefield as if he thought of something.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I just need to go up.\u2019</p><br/><p>This was good actually.</p><br/><p>That crazy thing would be running around while hunting for beings like himself.</p><br/><p>Rummaging through this entire world.</p><br/><p>Once it devoured all the transcendents in this world, it would then turn to the normal adventurers.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is going to become a land of the dead.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hermes decided to head towards the elevator right away.</p><br/><p>Though it was a shame to throw away his painstakingly created territory, it was better than being killed.</p><br/><p>He could always make a new land after going up anyway.</p><br/><p>But then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014parararararak\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hermes frowned as he felt something flying towards him.</p><br/><p>\u2018...This Flier is for emergency contact only\u2026 Did the others notice it as well?\u2019</p><br/><p>Then it would become troublesome.</p><br/><p>Since he would only be able to escape to the elevator if the others acted as bait for him.</p><br/><p>If everyone headed towards the elevator, then it was obvious where that monster would go to.</p><br/><p>After reading the message, Hermes sighed in relief.</p><br/><p>It seems they hadn\u2019t found out yet.</p><br/><p>But the message was still shocking.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Zeus? You\u2019re asking for help?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hermes was actually surprised.</p><br/><p>This guy would never ask for help even if he was tortured.</p><br/><p>But Hermes shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why should I?\u2019</p><br/><p>Of course they were on friendly terms.</p><br/><p>But there was no reason for him to when he was about to go up.</p><br/><p>That monster he\u2019d encountered was too terrifying for him to stay any longer than necessary.</p><br/><p>\u2018F***ing dumbass. Captured? What the hell happened to you? Just deal with it yourself.\u2019</p><br/><p>Nobody would respond to Zeus anyway.</p><br/><p>Hermes chuckled after deeming none of his comrades to be useful, and he charged towards the elevator using his .</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo checked the status of his body after moving about a hundred kilometers away from the War Fortress and into the tundra.</p><br/><p>There were no signs of life nearby.</p><br/><p>Well, there were non-humans.</p><br/><p>Kiiiing. </p><br/><p>A Dakrama charged towards the cave where Hansoo was standing.</p><br/><p>But after sensing Hansoo\u2019s horrifying aura, it immediately made a U-turn and ran away.</p><br/><p>The dark red smoke slowly drifted out of his body.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo chuckled at the sight.</p><br/><p>It had made a wise decision.</p><br/><p>There was a reason why he\u2019d headed so far away from the War Fortress.</p><br/><p>If he failed here, then everything in the nearby vicinity would be annihilated.</p><br/><p>If he failed, then his body would become a humongous living weapon.</p><br/><p>The Pandemic Blade\u2019s soul spoke to Hansoo.</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded.</p><br/><p>He was different from the other transcendents.</p><br/><p>He had to plant the Skills of Annihilation in his body one-by-one.</p><br/><p>Right from the beginning, that had been the aspect of his trait, the .</p><br/><p>A trait which allowed one to absorb the experience and knowledge of the creator of the skill, and even allow oneself to take it a step further.</p><br/><p>It only looked like a normal evolution on the surface.</p><br/><p>Though it was impossible to rise up a step by devouring some random skill, but devouring a skill of annihilation would allow him to evolve a skill to the next level.</p><br/><p>Like how he had crossed a wall when he evolved his Demonic Dragon\u2019s Reinforcement two years ago.</p><br/><p>The next skill to be evolved was already set.</p><br/><p>Pandemic Blade.</p><br/><p>Usually, this skill would evolve faster the more it was used to kill.</p><br/><p>Like how the owner of the Pandemic Blade had done in the past.</p><br/><p>The creator of this skill had melted an entire world, and from that incident, had trained the skill to its limits.</p><br/><p>And it was the obvious path to take.</p><br/><p>Though it would take longer, it was safer and more fun to do so.</p><br/><p>But there was a way to shorten the time as well.</p><br/><p>Like how the owner of the Nine Dragons Spear had done in the past.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo chuckled.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly those who need to die should die. Where\u2019s the meaning in a world if everyone dies?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Pandemic Blade\u2019s soul mumbled.</p><br/><p>&lt;...Whatever. You\u2019re the one dying, not me. At least you stopped playing around like a clown.&gt;</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014 </p><br/><p>The spores of the Pandemic Blade started to overflow inside Hansoo\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>The dark red aura that had been devouring his insides.</p><br/><p>The quickest and most efficient way to raise the mastery level of Pandemic Blade.</p><br/><p>[Forcefully make the number of spores go on a rampage and make your body get used to it]</p><br/><p>Gather the spores that are used to melt enemies and use them to melt your own body.</p><br/><p>Turn your own body into a container for the Pandemic Blade.</p><br/><p>This was the fastest and most efficient method indeed.</p><br/><p>If one discarded the dangers.</p><br/><p>\u2018Insane.\u2019</p><br/><p>The owner of the seed sighed.</p><br/><p>This guy had been doing this ever since his egg form.</p><br/><p>Though the Demonic Dragon\u2019s Reinforcement had risen to another level, the Pandemic Blade continued to reproduce to melt his nerves and intestines.</p><br/><p>Because of this, his muscles, bones, and tendons that had been enhanced by the Demonic Dragon\u2019s Reinforcement could not stand the pressure, and prevented them from working properly.</p><br/><p>He had to use a part of his mana to forcefully protect those parts of his body.</p><br/><p>He couldn't even use the Pandemic Blade as a weapon.</p><br/><p>Since the spores were focused on burning up his body.</p><br/><p>He\u2019d even got injured by things that he could crush with a finger, like that Dark King or Zeus.</p><br/><p>Someone who had fully mastered a skill and someone who\u2019d merely bulked up using crystals; the difference was like that of the heavens and earth, even within the 1st-star transcendents.</p><br/><p>Though both were made of iron, a baton and a sharp sword were vastly different.</p><br/><p>\u2018Though the mastery level of the Pandemic Blade did go up fast\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>He had done so up til now since there had been no real dangers, but now everything had changed.</p><br/><p>Hansoo had poured most of his mana into the Pandemic Blade instead of the Demonic Dragon\u2019s Reinforcement.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014roaaaarr!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s mana jade released a torrential amount of mana.</p><br/><p>Not to protect his body but to increase the number of spores.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014shhhhhhhh!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The dark red aura started to run rampant inside his body.</p><br/><p>The spores continued to reproduce, greedily devouring Hansoo\u2019s mana, melting his body down and seeping out from inside him.</p><br/><p>Dark red smoke seeped out from his seven orifices, and his skin was soon covered by a red, toxic substance.</p><br/><p>\u2014chiiiiiiiiik!\u2014 </p><br/><p>His entire body melted down as smoke rose up.</p><br/><p>And caused the Demonic Dragon\u2019s Reinforcement and Immortal Soul to retaliate furiously.</p><br/><p>A battle of time.</p><br/><p>Whether his body could withstand this and allow him to rise up to another level.</p><br/><p>Or melt down under the pressure.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ugh, why is he willing to go through all this\u2026? He just needs to melt down about half the people in this world.\u2019</p><br/><p>Who cares if the others died? Hansoo just needed to ignore that Ark-Roa, climb up and slowly train.</p><br/><p>And it would be even faster if he used the Pandemic Blade to train against those who would be dying anyway.</p><br/><p>Why was the future \u2018Demon King\u2019 acting like this?</p><br/><p>He was the owner of the being who had melted down an entire world to rise up as a transcendent, and he didn\u2019t understand this situation.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well\u2026 some already view this guy as a Demon King now.\u2019</p><br/><p>The soul then thought of Zeus, who should be running towards a specific location.</p><br/><p>The soul had heard Hansoo ordering Zeus to tell the others to gather if they didn\u2019t want to die.</p><br/><p>But couldn\u2019t they just go up?</p><br/><p>Hansoo, who was now fully covered in a dark-red shade, spoke with difficulty:</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2026doesn\u2019t\u2026ma\u2026tter\u2026Somebody\u2026else will\u2026act instead\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>&lt;...Who? Karhal? Ekidu? Those guys?&gt;</p><br/><p>Hansoo shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2014rummmmble\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014 swoooosh\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2018Good, good. I\u2019m almost there.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hermes, who had been ripping through space like a bolt of lightning, smiled as he neared the giant elevator.</p><br/><p>That Zeus guy was pretty useless, but he did give him an important piece of information.</p><br/><p>That the War Fortress was rebuilt and the adventurers were slowly gathering more Abyssal Crystals.</p><br/><p>Which meant that he could just pick up the crystals on the way.</p><br/><p>\u2018If there\u2019s some pretty girls\u2026 seven will do.\u2019</p><br/><p>He would need at least that much if he was going up to a new world.</p><br/><p>But as Hermes continued to fly with a smirk on his face\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014he suddenly stopped after seeing a familiar back.</p><br/><p>\u2018...What the? Did he notice it as well?\u2019</p><br/><p>The most silent one of them all.</p><br/><p>Though he had no skills related to the underworld, he was called Hades because he acted like a grim reaper would.</p><br/><p>And Hades was now standing on a hill, staring at the Elevator.</p><br/><p>All while hiding his aura.</p><br/><p>\u2018...I don\u2019t feel good about this.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was always best to follow suit if he had no information about what was going on.</p><br/><p>Hermes also hid his aura as he asked Hades.</p><br/><p>\u201c...What? Hades? Why are you standing here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hades nodded in greeting and only pointed towards the elevator.</p><br/><p>Towards a location near the giant elevator to be specific.</p><br/><p>And Hermes\u2019s expression turned stiff as he looked.</p><br/><p>The one who\u2019d made them.</p><br/><p>The being who stood in the deepest corners of their hearts like a heavy stone.</p><br/><p>That being had been slowly fading away from their memories because he had left without asking them for anything.</p><br/><p>But for him to appear at this time.</p><br/><p>And his objective seemed to be very clear.</p><br/><p>Kuaaaaa\u2026</p><br/><p>Their creator.</p><br/><p>And the person who was being crushed under his feet.</p><br/><p>Hermes clenched his fists as he looked at this scene.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cAahhhhh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The Dark King, who couldn\u2019t win over his fear of death and had tried to go up, had been caught and was now crying out loud.</p><br/><p>And the man who had cut off the legs of the Dark King chuckled as he looked around at the elevator.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t ask anything of them.</p><br/><p>Since no owner would ask the pigs they raised for anything.</p><br/><p>But it would be annoying if they went up.</p><br/><p>Because then the thing he had released would have less food.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s see\u2026 One or two should have been eaten already. Kang Hansoo, where are you now?\u2019</p><br/><p>No one could go up.</p><br/><p>The man who had released the Ark-Roa and had made the transcendents then laughed coldly next to the elevator.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

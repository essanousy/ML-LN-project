You should\u2019ve\u2026since I've only picked the good ones.\u2019</p><br/><p>People who didn\u2019t care about anything else in order to raise their own strength.</p><br/><p>People who wouldn\u2019t bat an eye at someone else\u2019s pain for their own advantage.</p><br/><p>He had specifically chosen those types since they would have the quickest growth.</p><br/><p>The man smiled as he thought of the \u2018seeds\u2019 he had planted.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>Amidst a field about 1,300 kilometers away from the War Fortress.</p><br/><p>In the middle of the Empire\u2019s border city of the past, two people stood atop a guard tower.</p><br/><p>Then the man looked towards the woman with sharp facial features.</p><br/><p>\u201cWoah, Demeter. You built a nice city.\u201d</p><br/><p>The woman called Demeter frowned as she spat back her reply:</p><br/><p>\u201cI said not to call me that, it makes me uncomfortable. Call me by my name. Ugh, why did Miguel suggest we do this\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man continued to smirk as he replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? I like this idea of Zeus\u2019s very much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Grow up. Please.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man shrugged as he spoke:</p><br/><p>\u201cJust ignore Zeus entirely then. He was the one who suggested we build the city as well. Look, look at how well you built the city.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man looked towards the vast city below them as he chuckled.</p><br/><p>The man was called Hermes.</p><br/><p>His hearing and sight were considered top class even among the transcendents.</p><br/><p>And in his eyes\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014he saw everything in their surroundings within a hundred-kilometers radius.</p><br/><p>\u2014boom!boom!boom!boom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The first thing that caught his attention was the thing right below them.</p><br/><p>There was something continuously making noise below the guard tower.</p><br/><p>Somewhere behind the walls, hundreds of malnourished people were slamming at something with hammers.</p><br/><p>Countless materials were being mixed together, and melted down with flames.</p><br/><p>Metals were turned into weapons, while other rare materials were turned into useful objects for the transcendents.</p><br/><p>\u2018Mmm....this is one thing I did better than Demeter.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hermes continued to look around with a content expression.</p><br/><p>Towards the vast icy plane past the castle walls.</p><br/><p>Screams of rage and pain continued to echo out.</p><br/><p>Thousands of adventurers had spread out around the icy planes to hunt.</p><br/><p>For materials to be used in alchemy.</p><br/><p>Of course, if he, a transcendent, fought with them, it would be easier for them to hunt, as well as much safer.</p><br/><p>But no that wouldn\u2019t do.</p><br/><p>How could they, who\u2019d reached the level of gods, do such a trivial task?</p><br/><p>Plus, they had something else to do anyway.</p><br/><p>\u2018Oh? Running away?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hermes whistled as he looked to Demeter.</p><br/><p>Though he didn\u2019t need to tell her, he wanted to get on her good side whenever he could.</p><br/><p>\u201cFilthy bugs.\u201d</p><br/><p>Demeter\u2019s expression turned dark.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>She slammed her foot on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u2014crunch!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014crackle!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Revealing a power that was similar to what Hansoo had displayed by using his Spirit.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014kakakakakak!\u2014 </p><br/><p>A giant metal pillar shot out from beneath the man who was trying to run away and pierced right through him.</p><br/><p>And shockingly, the man didn\u2019t die.</p><br/><p>Hermes shrugged at this scene.</p><br/><p>He knew why she hadn\u2019t killed the man.</p><br/><p>\u2018So thrifty.\u2019</p><br/><p>The man who had run would soon realize that he should have just died back then.</p><br/><p>Since he would soon be dragged to the nursery.</p><br/><p>\u2018But, anyway\u2026 where did she put it?\u2019</p><br/><p>Previously, it seemed to have been in the upper regions of the city, but now it had apparently disappeared.</p><br/><p>But after a moment of searching, the man realized where it was.</p><br/><p>It was right below them.</p><br/><p>Deep below them.</p><br/><p>Screams continued to echo out from deep underground.</p><br/><p>Screams of humans being ripped apart by abyssal beasts.</p><br/><p>\u2018She complained about it being ugly\u2026 I guess that\u2019s why she moved it underground\u2026\u2019 \u2018Demeter\u2026 how venomous, this is even bigger than mine.\u2019</p><br/><p>He thought he had a pretty large nursery, but Demeter\u2019s nursery was at least twice the size of his own.</p><br/><p>He himself filtered out pretty females to make a harem, so he had a certain order around the city, but Demeter seemed to despise all humans.</p><br/><p>To Demeter, all other normal beings on this floor were slaves that could create weapons for her, and deliver her the Abyssal Crystals.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026She\u2019ll get stronger much faster than me at this rate. I guess I\u2019ll need to go back and expand my nursery.\u2019</p><br/><p>Strength was law.</p><br/><p>Though they had formed an alliance out of fear for the being who\u2019d made them, if the balance of strength between them were to break, who knew what would happen?</p><br/><p>\u2018What\u2019s going on inside that guy\u2019s head anyway? Why were we given freedom\u2026?\u2019</p><br/><p>Well, it was a good thing anyway.</p><br/><p>Since they were given time to grow stronger.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes, we must get stronger.\u2019</p><br/><p>At this point, Hermes was speaking with a slightly annoyed voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t Hades and Zeus coming?\u201d</p><br/><p>The reason he\u2019d come was for a meeting.</p><br/><p>The topic of today\u2019s meeting was to discuss the issue of Ekidu and Karhal.</p><br/><p>And how they would erase them.</p><br/><p>Though they\u2019d merely been pressuring them up until now because they were too lazy to fully deal with them, those two bastards continued to be an annoyance.</p><br/><p>Since it had come to this, they were going to uproot them entirely.</p><br/><p>\u2018And...they seem to be getting stronger even faster than we are, despite not utilizing their territory\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Hermes had traded blows with Karhal recently, and his right hand was still throbbing from pain.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2018Hmm?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hermes frowned at the minute vibrations that rang out from deep under the ground.</p><br/><p>Hermes stole a glance at Demeter.</p><br/><p>\u2018Did she not feel it?\u2019</p><br/><p>Apparently, Demeter hadn\u2019t felt it.</p><br/><p>Well, it made sense.</p><br/><p>Even he, the one with the most heightened senses, had barely felt it due to his focus on the nursery.</p><br/><p>Very minute vibrations that had originated from very far away.</p><br/><p>\u2018What\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Hermes was about to mention it to Demeter, but then, he didn\u2019t need to.</p><br/><p>Since the vibrations were getting stronger by the second.</p><br/><p>And soon even Demeter could feel it.</p><br/><p>\u201c...What the hell\u2026is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>The vibrations were getting increasingly stronger.</p><br/><p>They thought that something had blown up beneath the earth, but soon they realized what was really going on.</p><br/><p>The vibrations weren\u2019t getting stronger, but rather the thing causing it was getting closer.</p><br/><p>At a tremendous speed.</p><br/><p>\u2014rummmble!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s coming through the mana node!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cF***! What the hell?\u201d</p><br/><p>Demeter shouted out in shock.</p><br/><p>The aura of the mysterious thing heading towards them was extremely vicious and evil.</p><br/><p>To the point where she couldn\u2019t determine what it could be.</p><br/><p>Demeter pondered for a bit and then spoke to Hermes.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s run away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRun away?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hermes clenched his teeth.</p><br/><p>\u2018Can we even get away?\u2019</p><br/><p>The mysterious thing was moving way too fast.</p><br/><p>To the point where he\u2019d barely be able to escape even at his fastest speed.</p><br/><p>Demeter nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. With your skill, you could move fast enough even if you carried me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...\u201d</p><br/><p>Demeter clenched her teeth as she looked at the silent Hermes.</p><br/><p>\u2018This bastard. He\u2019s always nagging at me to sleep with him, but\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>It seems the moment their lives were on the line, even Hermes was having second thoughts.</p><br/><p>But there was nothing else she could do.</p><br/><p>Though she was stronger in terms of strength, she was much inferior when it came to speed.</p><br/><p>Demeter shouted at Hermes:</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we get out of this, I\u2019ll grant you one wish, so\u2026 let\u2019s just try running away first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hermes pondered for a moment but then shook his head as he lifted Demeter up.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s just think of it as doing some charity work. I\u2019ll be getting a wish anyway.\u2019</p><br/><p>He had slept with countless beautiful women.</p><br/><p>What he wanted now was a strong woman.</p><br/><p>A woman even stronger than himself.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Though that Ekidu girl is who I really want, this is still good enough.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014 </p><br/><p>The wind spirits started to gather beneath Hermes.</p><br/><p>And the space beneath his feet folded onto itself.</p><br/><p>But right at the moment when Hermes and Demeter looked close to flying off\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u201cWait.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>Demeter urged Hermes on after he had stopped.</p><br/><p>That mysterious thing was charging towards this place at a tremendous speed anyway.</p><br/><p>While releasing that terrifying aura that pricked her skin.</p><br/><p>She wanted to leave as fast as possible, but why had he stopped?</p><br/><p>Hermes smiled at Demeter.</p><br/><p>\u201cDumbo. We need to clean things up before we leave, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014 </p><br/><p>Demeter extended her feet and slammed down onto the ground.</p><br/><p>\u2014rummmble!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Thousands and thousands of spikes shot up everywhere within a radius of a few kilometers around them.</p><br/><p>Right from beneath the feet of the adventurers.</p><br/><p>\u2014kwadddduk\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014kaduk\u2014 </p><br/><p>While Hermes was shocked by the noise, Demeter just lifted her feet and said:</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. It\u2019ll take a bit of time for that thing to eat all of this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hermes smirked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a smart girl.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Sexy.\u2019</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014boooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The guard tower that they\u2019d been standing on blew apart, and their bodies instantly turned into a dot in the distance.</p><br/><p>Ahhhh!</p><br/><p>Uaaahhh!</p><br/><p>The only thing left behind were the adventurers who were still screaming.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at this, Sir Kang Hansoo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo frowned at what Akran had hurriedly brought over.</p><br/><p>A dark piece of rock.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou found this in the maze?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, more specifically, near the mana node that passes through the maze.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo mumbled as he looked at the dark piece of rock that some lifeform had created.</p><br/><p>\u2018I wondered why there were no higher grade races\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>With this around, no other races could really settle down.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone seems to have the same thoughts that I did.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026The same thoughts?\u2019</p><br/><p>Zeus looked confused by Hansoo\u2019s words.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

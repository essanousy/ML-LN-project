I\u2019ve never seen that before.\u201d</p><br/><p>R-Eronia Nell, who had been looking at the alien man from her office, stared into the screen in a daze.</p><br/><p>Darkness covered the man\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>And his battle prowess suddenly skyrocketed.</p><br/><p>So strong that even the seven Dragon God Soldiers, who had received the Flame\u2019s Blessing, had been reduced to a pulp in an instant.</p><br/><p>The Technorat nearby was also watching the screen, and in confusion, N-Magaroan voiced her opinion.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a brand new form he has never shown before. If you give me enough time I can analyze\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>But even before she could finish her words\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014R-Eronia Nell slammed her fists onto the table and screamed.</p><br/><p>\u201cMore time?! He\u2019s about to breach through our defenses!\u201d</p><br/><p>The defensive line of the capital city, Neoreim.</p><br/><p>Every ship had gone out to the battlefield against Pompeion while many of the Dragon God Soldiers had been spread around the continent.</p><br/><p>The capital was very close to that man.</p><br/><p>If he got through that line of defense, he was basically at the capital already.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn! Dispatch everyone who received the Flame\u2019s Blessing into that place!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026 the side effects!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou dumb b****!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014thud!\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh!\u201d</p><br/><p>N-Magaroan collapsed onto the floor after receiving R-Eronia Nell\u2019s enraged kick.</p><br/><p>R-Eronia Nell then picked N-Magaroan up, brought her face close to her own and whispered:</p><br/><p>\u201cI order you. Make\u2026 as many blessed ones as you can and dump them there. No matter what you do\u2026 He cannot come into the capital.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fairytale stories of the prince who came to save the princess or the hero saving his comrades.</p><br/><p>If that man\u2019s goal was that valiant then it would be good for both sides, but it was clear how far his true goals were from such fantasies.</p><br/><p>The Relic.</p><br/><p>An object that they and the Pompeion Empire had each taken.</p><br/><p>The treasure of all treasures that allowed their technology to soar so much.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t a man in love or a warrior who had lost his friends.</p><br/><p>He\u2019d come here to steal their treasure.</p><br/><p>\u2018You bandit\u2026 This is as far as you go!\u2019</p><br/><p>The family leaders shouldn\u2019t bother themselves with such a job as this.</p><br/><p>Their true opponent was far away in the distance, the Emperor Pompeion.</p><br/><p>Not these bugs crawling around on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u2018Thief\u2026 I will bury you here.\u2019</p><br/><p>At this moment, R-Eronia Nell thought of the ones receiving the Flame\u2019s Blessings and smiled coldly.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014</p><br/><p>Kiriel looked at the Dragon God Soldiers continuing to fly their way and asked Hansoo:</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 Aren\u2019t we going to use that Relic?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although the power of that skill Hansoo had just used was powerful, the power of the Relic that their opponents were using was tempting as well.</p><br/><p>Even more so since they had a Relic as well.</p><br/><p>\u2018We\u2019re terribly outnumbered\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>As Kiriel made a bitter expression at the sheer number of people swarming towards them\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014Hansoo, who had rid himself of the dark light, shook his head and spoke:</p><br/><p>\u201cWe might end up luring those things.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014guoooo!\u2014</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked towards the giant monsters in the far distance.</p><br/><p>The giant moving mountains that were ignoring the countless attacks from the ships and were searching for more Great Furnaces.</p><br/><p>He knew how to use this Relic and had the physical power to withstand it as well.</p><br/><p>But the moment he used this\u2026</p><br/><p>All those mountains would converge onto him.</p><br/><p>The strength hidden inside this thing was far greater and purer than the Great Furnace.</p><br/><p>It was the origin of those giant mountain-sized monsters after all.</p><br/><p>If he used it now, then unlike the Neropa Union\u2019s current indirect method, there would be a huge shockwave that would only serve to attract their attention.</p><br/><p>Those mountains were hard to deal with even for beings who had already reached the 4th Star.</p><br/><p>Since even the warship fleets couldn\u2019t handle that thing.</p><br/><p>\u2018Too strong. And it\u2019s getting more and more annoying.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo thought, looking at the Haetara in the distance.</p><br/><p>As it passed by a city, the Haetara seemed like it needed a snack and was now eating up the Great Furnace within.</p><br/><p>\u2014crunch!\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014crackle!\u2014</p><br/><p>But strangely, the giant mountain was slowly decreasing in size as it ate the furnace.</p><br/><p>It was an extremely minute change so most people hadn't noticed it yet.</p><br/><p>But this wasn\u2019t the right time to agitate it yet.</p><br/><p>If all seven of those monsters came here then they would easily crush apart the defensive line, causing the Pompeion Empire to rush over instantly.</p><br/><p>Hansoo did not want that to happen yet.</p><br/><p>Those things and the fleets needed to stay where they were.</p><br/><p>While he dealt with the issue here.</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble!\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014whoosh!\u2014</p><br/><p>Hansoo laughed as he looked at the mass of Dragon God Soldiers coming his way.</p><br/><p>\u2018It seems they scrounged up every last bit they could.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo felt the squirming seed of the Nine Dragons Strike inside him and refocused his attention onto another seed.</p><br/><p>The skill he obtained after beating Melchizedek in the 5th Zone.</p><br/><p>Although it hadn\u2019t been long since he planted it inside him, the seed that was glowing in a natural multicolored light was letting out an aura that didn\u2019t lose out to the Nine Dragons Strike.</p><br/><p>Hansoo took a glance at the soldiers before his eyes and then probed the seed in the center of his chest.</p><br/><p>And at that moment\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble!\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014a giant shockwave rang out inside his head.</p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014</p><br/><p>His vision quickly darkened.</p><br/><p>Darkness covered the entire sky and not a single ray of light pierced through, causing the land to fall into shadow.</p><br/><p>Lightning strikes struck down from the dark clouds and his surroundings could no longer be seen.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo knew.</p><br/><p>That this was only occurring inside his mind.</p><br/><p>A phenomenon caused after he activated this skill and entered the other dimension.</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble!\u2014</p><br/><p>The land around Hansoo broke down and a giant hole appeared.</p><br/><p>\u2014thud!\u2014</p><br/><p>A giant hand rose up, grabbed Hansoo and dragged him down.</p><br/><p>A tremendous strength that no existence could resist.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo did not resist as he let it drag him down.</p><br/><p>And soon\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014Hansoo arrived at a dark space.</p><br/><p>Like an underground cave but with a spacious area.</p><br/><p>It was clear.</p><br/><p>That this wasn\u2019t Angkara\u2019s underground area.</p><br/><p>No creature like this had lived under Angkara.</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014</p><br/><p>Behind the giant hand that dragged Hansoo down.</p><br/><p>The existence belonging to that hand could be seen.</p><br/><p>An existence so large that it treated those giant Haetaras as nothing more than bugs.</p><br/><p>A spider-like body with eight arms and eight legs.</p><br/><p>The thousands of eyes on its head glowed with a red light as it watched Hansoo in the darkness.</p><br/><p>And it wasn\u2019t just one spider next to Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u2014whooosh!\u2014</p><br/><p>It was dark but because there were flames emitting a little bit of light, it told Hansoo that there were many more of them.</p><br/><p>Thirteen existences that had completely different auras.</p><br/><p>Of course, they all had different appearances as well.</p><br/><p>Some were even larger than the spider and some were only as big as Hansoo.</p><br/><p>One glowing with a white light and one had a horn embedded in its forehead.</p><br/><p>But they all had some similarities as well.</p><br/><p>One had a terrifying amount of rage surrounding its body.</p><br/><p>While another was unfathomably powerful.</p><br/><p>As Hansoo descended from the spider\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>The thirteen existences started to argue with each other.</p><br/><p>The one who started it was the spider that had dragged Hansoo down.</p><br/><p>But even before the spider finished its words\u2026</p><br/><p>Countless angry voices filled the area.</p><br/><p>Hansoo frowned at the arguments of the thirteen existences but then pointed towards one of them.</p><br/><p>Two horns and thirteen pairs of wings.</p><br/><p>Although its size was similar to Hansoo\u2019s, its aura didn\u2019t lose out to the giant creatures at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up. You. You\u2019re coming with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The existence that was covered from head to toe in darkness and was laying around in a lazy manner.</p><br/><p>It was the most useful one in this situation.</p><br/><p>The moment his words rang out\u2014</p><br/><p>&lt;...&gt;</p><br/><p>&lt;...&gt;</p><br/><p>\u2014the loud area suddenly turned deathly quiet.</p><br/><p>The one who broke it was the man who Hansoo had chosen.</p><br/><p>There were thirteen in all.</p><br/><p>All of them had the strength to rip the world apart but this kid before their eyes could not withstand such a strength.</p><br/><p>It only made sense for him to choose someone who was the most suitable for the situation outside.</p><br/><p>As Hansoo stayed silent, the man shrugged his shoulders and said:</p><br/><p>At the man\u2019s words\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014Hansoo replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know too well. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>He knew way too well.</p><br/><p>As to what these things were.</p><br/><p>How much strength they had.</p><br/><p>What kind of ability and personality as well.</p><br/><p>How could he not?</p><br/><p>These were beings he had shed countless drops of tears and blood to defeat in his previous life.</p><br/><p>\u2018Allowing me to experience my old memories, that damned fairy.\u2019</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>A skill that entrapped the most powerful thirteen demons within the Abyss.</p><br/><p>In his previous life, he had to put his life on the line multiple times to defeat these things despite being countless times stronger than he was right now.</p><br/><p>The difference between his strength and theirs was no joke.</p><br/><p>Although there were side effects\u2026</p><br/><p>That meant the strength he received was just that great.</p><br/><p>\u2014thud!\u2014</p><br/><p>The demon who grabbed Hansoo\u2019s hand, Barmamunt, quickly shot up into the sky with Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201c...What the hell is that?

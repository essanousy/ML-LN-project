Temporarily?\u201d</p><br/><p>R-Zairon Nell barely managed to reply to Kiriel\u2019s confused questioning.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, According to him, we seem to have the same goals. We can work together until then.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying the words that hurt his pride, R-Zairon Nell looked at the researcher-like man standing next to him.</p><br/><p>No, he was an actual scientist of the Technorat branch.</p><br/><p>\u2018N-Aroel.\u2019</p><br/><p>He\u2019d heard of him before.</p><br/><p>The man with the same level of ability as N-Akuon, the leader of the Technorats.</p><br/><p>Being the leader of all technical-related things on the Kalkuroun fleet was an immensely high position.</p><br/><p>If he didn\u2019t have that ability, then he would\u2019ve long lost his life from the rage of a Nell family member.</p><br/><p>And being on the same level as that N-Akuon, that was not something so simple.</p><br/><p>\u2018I heard they sent him away due to some past incidents\u2026 It seems they sent him to be the leader of the Aokan.\u2019</p><br/><p>Then it made sense.</p><br/><p>As to how he\u2019d survived without any battle prowess while at Aokan, which had become as close as possible to a living hell.</p><br/><p>For the leader of all technology in Aokan, he would know all its mechanisms and structures.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, it doesn\u2019t seem as simple as that.\u2019</p><br/><p>R-Zairon Nell was at a loss as he looked at N-Aroel, who looked like he\u2019d crawled out of a sewer.</p><br/><p>Dirty, tattered robes and an overgrown beard.</p><br/><p>Strange-colored skin as well as various machines attached to his back.</p><br/><p>In comparison to N-Akuon, who was living an almost germophobic life on the Kalkuroun fleet, he looked well-prepared.</p><br/><p>N-Aroel looked embarrassed at R-Zairon Nell\u2019s stare but soon focused on the task at hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems you also have a job to fulfill, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have come for the crystals, correct?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiriel frowned at this.</p><br/><p>\u2018Was he spying on me?\u2019</p><br/><p>But she hadn\u2019t felt anyone watching her.</p><br/><p>N-Aroel seemed to have read Kiriel\u2019s thoughts and quickly shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t spy on you or anything. We\u2019ve just studied you over a long period of time, so we kind of realized a few action patterns. All the strong members of your kind seem to be looking for crystals. And there\u2019s no other reason for you to enter this dangerous city.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Correct to a degree.</p><br/><p>N-Aroel continued to speak as he watched Kiriel.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Quantum Transmission has been activated. And\u2026 I believe there will be many more things we can do if we form an alliance. And it wouldn\u2019t be a waste of time, either. These crystals are important to you, correct? We have no use for them whatsoever.\u201d</p><br/><p>N-Aroel looked at Kiriel and said:</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can take the crystals and help us stop the transmission. It\u2019s not bad, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot bad, you guys really are trying hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>N-Aroel made a bitter expression at Kiriel\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt has been a very long time since I\u2019ve been trapped in this place, living like a rat. I have\u2026 seen a lot of things. As to what kind of beings these things are.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiriel and all the Dragon God Soldiers all made similar expressions of understanding.</p><br/><p>It was only for a short while, but that was more than enough time to know what kind of creatures those things were.</p><br/><p>N-Aroel continued to speak with a heavy expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook, imagine these things falling down onto a whole planet. To our planet. How could we not try hard?\u201d</p><br/><p>R-Zairon Nell looked at N-Aroel with a respectful gaze.</p><br/><p>\u2018I must remember this kid.\u2019</p><br/><p>N-Aroel glanced around and then continued to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2026 is a secret tunnel here. Of course, there\u2019ll be a lot of Quirae along the way, but\u2026 We\u2019ll be able to get to the center much faster. I will lead you there, and you may take all the crystals you find along the way\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re heading to the center, I didn\u2019t come here alone, you see.\u201d</p><br/><p>N-Aroel shook his head when he heard Kiriel speak about joining up with Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, we won\u2019t go that way. We\u2019ll go a different way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>Instead of Kiriel, R-Zairon Nell was the one who asked.</p><br/><p>Logically, it was better to group up with the other man and head into the depths.</p><br/><p>N-Aroel screamed.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit\u2026! We cannot go there! No matter what!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone looked questioningly at N-Aroel\u2019s reaction.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2014boooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s really not easy.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo thought to himself.</p><br/><p>He thought it\u2019d be easy to breach the center while wearing the blue armor, but it seems like he\u2019d overestimated himself.</p><br/><p>\u20184th-level. Hmm.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha\u2026 kekeke.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo frowned as he looked at the 4th-level evolution of the Quirae before his eyes.</p><br/><p>Being a 4th-level wasn\u2019t an issue.</p><br/><p>He\u2019d thought the Quirae only devoured humans.</p><br/><p>Then there wouldn\u2019t be much of an issue.</p><br/><p>Since their strength relied on what they ate.</p><br/><p>But the one that appeared before his eyes had definitely eaten something that wasn\u2019t human.</p><br/><p>The spikes protruding out from the muscles on various parts of its body.</p><br/><p>It was not a trait of the Quirae nor that of a human.</p><br/><p>Nor was it a trait of the natives of Angkara.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2026 ate the original owners of the blue armor, huh? They were in there, I see.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cKeke\u2026kehehehe\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The 4th-level Quirae screamed at Hansoo as they crawled out from a part of the city that was glowing brightly.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Boom.</p><br/><p>The Carnivorous Beast was smashing the insides of the Altar as if it was about to go crazy from hunger.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hmm. Goblin poison won\u2019t even work\u2019</p><br/><p>Poison would work since its Physical and Magic resistances were low but if you take into account of its regeneration speed than it was practically useless.</p><br/><p>It would be much better to just smear on some Land Mermaid\u2019s Paralysis poison and then just stab it into where the nerves were gathered.</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked down whilst putting a cloud snack up to this mouth after he squeezed the shampoo bottle and smeared a large amount of the paralysis poison on the needle.</p><br/><p>And then he proceeded to inhale all the smoke that came out of it into his body.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s really been a while. Though it\u2019s really strong\u2019</p><br/><p>As the smoke swirled into his body, he felt the number of runes that determined the laws on his body skyrocket.</p><br/><p>84. 85. 86\u2026</p><br/><p>And when it went over 100, a change occurred in Hansoo\u2019s body that hadn\u2019t appeared before.</p><br/><p>Crack Crack</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded as he felt the change.</p><br/><p>\u2018Good. I\u2019ve gone to the next stage\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo checked his current condition.</p><br/><p>[Kang Hansoo]</p><br/><p>Strength(Colorless): 0.01% (Maniac\u2019s Cloud Snack: +20%)</p><br/><p>Stamina(Colorless): 0.01% (Maniac\u2019s Cloud Snack: +20%)</p><br/><p>Agility: 50.5 (Maniac\u2019s Cloud Snack: +20%)</p><br/><p>Perception: 50.6 (Maniac\u2019s Cloud Snack: +20%)</p><br/><p>Mana 26.4 (Maniac\u2019s Cloud Snack: +20%)</p><br/><p>Magic resistance 15.6 (Maniac\u2019s Cloud Snack: +20%)</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s been done\u2019</p><br/><p>A new energy, that was different from what had existed before, swirled throughout his body.</p><br/><p>They show it in numbers in order to make it easy for people to understand in the beginning in the Tutorial but the runes were actually shown in a progressive way.</p><br/><p>Like experience.</p><br/><p>It said it was colorless but an aura that emitted a faint light twirled around Hansoo\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>When a color becomes integrated like that then it truly becomes the Otherworld\u2019s rune from that point on.</p><br/><p>In one sense, what they had to do was similar.</p><br/><p>Just like how one got strong when the number of runes went up, when the percentage rose they would naturally get strong.</p><br/><p>The fact that you needed to collect runes to become strong was the same.</p><br/><p>If there was a difference then it was that when you hit 100%, then your rune will change into the rune of next stage.</p><br/><p>From colorless to red, from red to orange, from orange to yellow and so on.</p><br/><p>It rose stage by stage.</p><br/><p>And every time your rune increased by a stage, you gained a large benefit.</p><br/><p>There was only a very small difference between normal rune 99.9 and colorless rune 0.01% but there is a large gap in between.</p><br/><p>Since the aura of activating the rune had grown by a stage.</p><br/><p>\u2018Good\u2019</p><br/><p>You needed at least this much in order to get through his defenses.</p><br/><p>Since at a glance you could see that it was also using an aura of an colorless rune.</p><br/><p>The strength of the monster could be felt much closer when he saw it from above.</p><br/><p>\u2018As I would expect, Kwang Goonju. He wasn\u2019t quite sane but he was still extraordinary\u2019</p><br/><p>Even if he had used his trait and skills, even if he had become half a corpse, the fact that he killed that thing was unbelievable.</p><br/><p>That thing was something you will only see around the colorless area, which will become the background for the 2nd tutorial stage, and only around the mid-late stage of it.</p><br/><p>In conclusion, it was not something that would come out in the 1st tutorial stage.</p><br/><p>And it was even more burdensome to him since he couldn\u2019t use his trait and skills.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tsk. I would\u2019ve crushed it to bits if I just learned something around a Troll\u2019s Essence\u2019</p><br/><p>But he also had a lot of expectations.</p><br/><p>Even he didn\u2019t know what would come out of the hidden piece after he clears it.</p><br/><p>Since the only person he knew who cleared this was only Kwang Goonju.</p><br/><p>Eres, Gangtae and Keldian all failed.</p><br/><p>So he didn\u2019t know what would come out but one thing was certain.</p><br/><p>That this damnable world kept pushing people around but the reward itself was quite clear.</p><br/><p>The harder and more impossible something seems the better the reward will be.</p><br/><p>And this was a hidden piece that only one person had succeeded in before.</p><br/><p>There was no way something scrubby would come out.</p><br/><p>\u2018It would be a jackpot if a Numbering Artifact or Skill would come out\u2019</p><br/><p>Double Numbering, no, even a triple Numbering would be a jackpot.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s go\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo, who had finished his preparations, inserted a Flying Cat\u2019s Marble into his cheeks and jumped down ruthlessly with a cloud snack in his mouth.</p><br/><p>The stamina depletion would start now anyways, if you take into account for the marble\u2019s regeneration speed then it would be helpful to go in biting onto it.</p><br/><p>Kuaaaaaahhh!</p><br/><p>And soon the giant beast\u2019s roar that was filled with rage blew out from the inside of the altar.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Kuahhhh!</p><br/><p>Sangjin gulped as he heard the roaring cries from afar.</p><br/><p>Because it felt like his legs would shake just from the noise.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a problem with strength but rather a problem of breed.</p><br/><p>A cry from a predator created to eat humans was shaking their souls.</p><br/><p>\u2018So he\u2019s fighting one on one against that thing\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>The feeling of wanting to become like Hansoo and jealously, and the wanting of being accepted by Hansoo mixed around and filled his head.</p><br/><p>And that acted as inertia and helped Sangjin\u2019s shaking legs to move.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yeah. If I suceed this then Hansoo wouldn\u2019t be able to ignore me anymore\u2019</p><br/><p>Then Sangjin looked behind him.</p><br/><p>And behind there were 10 people whom he was speaking to before gathered there.</p><br/><p>Suyeol, who was standing in the front, made a slightly fed up expression for a moment but then laughed as he looked at Sangjin</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good that you chose not to bring your friends right? Your friends could\u2019ve been in danger\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangjin shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I haven\u2019t thought of your words. That Hansoo could be danger right now.</p><br/><p>And then Sangjin remembered that happened before.</p><br/><p>Suyeol and Sangjin shared a lot of words.</p><br/><p>And there was a question that Suyeol asked.</p><br/><p>And when he thought of it after hearing that question, there was some logic into it.</p><br/><p>There was a similar case before.</p><br/><p>Hansoo pushed them back when he went to really dangerous places.</p><br/><p>And the fact that he wanted to go alone this time meant that it was really dangerous.</p><br/><p>And he had even asked for extra runes.</p><br/><p>Hansoo wasn\u2019t a type to lie just in order to scam some runes.</p><br/><p>Which meant it was an enemy that he needed at least that amount of runes to go up against.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yeah. Even if it\u2019s Hansoo, it doesn\u2019t make sense that he will have the upper hand against that monster\u2019</p><br/><p>Sangjin nodded as he answered.</p><br/><p>Suyeol laughed at those words as he spoke</p><br/><p>Sangjin nodded at those words.</p><br/><p>Like Hansoo said before, it was better the more numbers you had.</p><br/><p>The only time numbers would be disadvantageous is when things aren\u2019t clear and they are wandering around, the people here were the strongest of the 60.</p><br/><p>They would be of great help even if they acted like meat shields.</p><br/><p>Suyeol looked at Sangjin, who was making a confused expression, as he spoke.</p><br/><p>&lt;\u2026monopolize?&gt;</p><br/><p>And then Sangjin made a slightly dejected face as he nodded.</p><br/><p>There is definitely a possibility that that was the case.</p><br/><p>It was like that in the train station and even on the first night Hansoo hadn\u2019t shared anything he had earned himself.</p><br/><p>He was pretending to hand out trivial things such as runes, that could be gathered easily, while monopolizing all the good stuff himself.</p><br/><p>As Sangjin remembered the clip he saw earlier and made an astringent face, Suyeol beat his chest.</p><br/><p>Sangjin nodded at those words.</p><br/><p>But then Suyeol shook his head.</p><br/><p>Sangjin shook his heads at those words.</p><br/><p>If Hansoo were to fall in danger before then he would lose an important chance.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yeah, If I help this time\u2026 then Hansoo wouldn\u2019t be able to ignore me&gt;</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about? Let\u2019s follow him up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh.. yes\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangjin nodded his head and then headed towards the top of the Altar and Suyeol grinned at that Sangjin.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Monsters. Let\u2019s just leave them to fight by themselves and move around on our own.\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the players whispered in fear.</p><br/><p>If they showed the battle and the viewers asked to fight then things would change.</p><br/><p>Since they couldn\u2019t refuse the words of the people watching them.</p><br/><p>\u2018No. I don\u2019t even want to get involved in that at all. Crazy bastards\u2026 How do you even get that strong?\u2019</p><br/><p>Even if they got involved, there wasn\u2019t much they could do.</p><br/><p>Maybe they might be able to ambush them later.</p><br/><p>But right now, there was a bigger and more important objective.</p><br/><p>The players ignored the noises in the distance and carefully headed towards the giant structure in the distance.</p><br/><p>It was clearly different from the residential areas until now.</p><br/><p>As the vast area with the giant structure came into view, the chat room watching the live broadcast exploded.</p><br/><p>And as if the movements of the players got quicker as if they were responding to the chat and soon they arrived by the giant dome shaped structure.</p><br/><p>And befitting of this giant structure, a much more powerful protective energy field than the one above was flowing through it.</p><br/><p>Clang!</p><br/><p>One of the players frowned as they smacked the wall.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe did arrive but\u2026 Maybe this doesn\u2019t have an entrance as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the players nearby shook his head and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s spread out and search. Whoever finds it sends a signal.\u201d</p><br/><p>And the players nodded as they spread out.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>Rummblee.</p><br/><p>\u2018...It suddenly got quiet. But wait\u2026 Isn\u2019t it dangerous if those guys stop fighting?\u2019</p><br/><p>One player, who had been moving around the area, felt a chill run down his back as he continued to search around.</p><br/><p>But this worry only lasted a moment.</p><br/><p>\u201c...Found it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The player, , felt his heart thumping and smiled.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t big but was clearly designed for people to enter.</p><br/><p>And the player who had found the entrance first started to enter it.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well\u2026 They did tell us to send a signal but\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Karax shrugged his shoulders.</p><br/><p>Was there really a need to?</p><br/><p>\u2018I could just be checking things out first in case it\u2019s dangerous.\u2019</p><br/><p>Karax chuckled as he carefully entered.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t broadcasting this anyway since he wasn\u2019t really interested in things like that.</p><br/><p>There was only one important matter.</p><br/><p>Things of worth.</p><br/><p>If they found it together they would need to share it but if nobody knew about it then it\u2019ll all be his.</p><br/><p>But while he was walking into this place.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Woah.\u2019</p><br/><p>Karax stopped and whistled in place.</p><br/><p>From the scene that appeared in front of his eyes.</p><br/><p>Oooooooong!</p><br/><p>Thousands of marbles.</p><br/><p>Sizes ranging from that close to humans all the way up to a small house.</p><br/><p>Though these glass-like marbles were transparent, they were filled with multicolored lights.</p><br/><p>Some blue, some red and some green.</p><br/><p>And Karax realized where he had seen these lights.</p><br/><p>It was awfully similar to the things he and the others had.</p><br/><p>\u2018Spirit Stones.\u2019</p><br/><p>Of course he belonged to the top tier players who could hunt in the Spirit Land.</p><br/><p>He had his own Spirit Stone and had even seen a few S grades while hunting.</p><br/><p>And the light that radiated out from these things were similar to the light that came out from the Spirit Stones.</p><br/><p>But there was a fundamental difference.</p><br/><p>The difference of energy.</p><br/><p>The lights that flickered around as if they were alive.</p><br/><p>They really seemed to be alive.</p><br/><p>The lights inside the marbles were contantly pulsating while releasing tremendous amount of energy through the tube attached above the marble and that energy flowed to an unknown location.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Karax pondered about breaking these for a moment but soon gave up.</p><br/><p>These beautiful lights gave out an eerie feeling of some sort.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hmm...Is there nothing else?\u2019</p><br/><p>Though the marbles had caught his attention first, these shouldn\u2019t be the only things in this giant building.</p><br/><p>At that moment something came into his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2018...They seem to be heading to one specific spot.\u2019</p><br/><p>Though about half of the tubes were heading towards the colonies outside, the other half was different.</p><br/><p>Towards a deeper location.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yeah. This shouldn\u2019t be all of it.\u2019</p><br/><p>Ommmmmmmm.</p><br/><p>Karax left the marbles and proceeded to head deeper into the structure.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Kwaaadddddk!</p><br/><p>The moment Hansoo attacked the heart.</p><br/><p>\u201c..Kuhuk.\u201d</p><br/><p>The shadows surrounding Jang Oh\u2019s body trembled.</p><br/><p>An accurate attack right on the heart.</p><br/><p>The skills and the power of the spirit shattered.</p><br/><p>Jang Oh realized that Hansoo had saved a bit of strength for this chance.</p><br/><p>\u2018...I thought I knew him a bit from the fight he had with Metiron.\u2019</p><br/><p>The spirit was something that was as powerful as the Mana Jade Hansoo had.</p><br/><p>Though he lost out in terms of the quality of skills or one\u2019s physical prowess, he won in the quantity of skills and the mastery level of the skills.</p><br/><p>He had thought that he wouldn\u2019t lose out in terms of artifacts with the shield but...There was another fatal difference.</p><br/><p>\u2018For his battle skills to be better than mine\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>As Jang Oh was lost in thought at the fact that his battle skills that had been honed for 18 years had been beaten by a newcomer to this zone.</p><br/><p>Whooooosh!</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s right fist headed towards his temple to kill.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yeah...This is better\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>As Jang Oh was about to faint while watching the fist coming towards him.</p><br/><p>&lt;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&gt;</p><br/><p>The soul fragment Jang Oh denied started to violently shake.</p><br/><p>Then Jang Oh\u2019s right hand moved at lightning speed and blocked the fist with his shield.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>The Seven Strands Spear which had threatened Hansoo in the zone below started to head towards Hansoo while being surrounded in a dark aura.</p><br/><p>Though there was no mana jade to support this, Jang Oh was much stronger than Metiron and there was the power of the spirit on top of this.</p><br/><p>And the power behind it would not be small at this close of a range.</p><br/><p>Whooooosh!</p><br/><p>Hansoo frowned as he backed off.</p><br/><p>Soon.</p><br/><p>Crunch!</p><br/><p>Craack!</p><br/><p>Jang Oh regenerated the caved in chest as he spoke to Hansoo expressionlessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cJang Oh is too compassionate. How would he be able to complete the contract with Tiamet at this ra...Fuck!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jang Oh suddenly shouted in shock and raised his shield again.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s right hand smashed onto the shield again.</p><br/><p>Hansoo muttered while looking at the different eyes of Jang oh.</p><br/><p>\u2018You speak too much.\u2019</p><br/><p>Booooom!</p><br/><p>Hansoo then continued to attack.</p><br/><p>He had to finish this off quickly and go in.</p><br/><p>\u2018Those guys are getting on my nerves.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked towards the structure behind him that had started to activate with a strange noise.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

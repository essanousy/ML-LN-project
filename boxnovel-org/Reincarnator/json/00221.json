Essential items! Prepare them quick!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTwo spots left! Recruiting people urgently!\u201d</p><br/><p>Countless people were moving around and shouting within the town at corner of the dark underground structure.</p><br/><p>A town made from the hands of players.</p><br/><p>\u2018What an unkind game.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hikokomaria thought about how long this town took to build and mumbled.</p><br/><p>The Exodus did not supply the players with anything for their benefit.</p><br/><p>It was just literally another world.</p><br/><p>There weren\u2019t NPCs who sold unlimited amounts of potions and neither was there people who handed out quests with set requirements.</p><br/><p>The players, who were used to friendly game systems which were designed to attract as many people as possible, were shocked by this game at first but they slowly realized.</p><br/><p>That this kind of cockyness in this game stemmed from its confidence.</p><br/><p>\u2018As long as a game\u2019s fun, it will be popular.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hikikomaria mumbled as he looked at the countless people in the Level 1 Supply Zone.</p><br/><p>Though the game company was unfriendly, the game itself was fun.</p><br/><p>So it was up to the players to deal with things that were uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>If there wasn\u2019t a clan system then they would recruit them in real life.</p><br/><p>If there wasn\u2019t a village then they would create it with people.</p><br/><p>The Level 1 Supply Zone here was created in this manner.</p><br/><p>They had dealt with various traps and beasts on level 1 and settled upon a wide area in the maze.</p><br/><p>As safety was slowly increasing as more and more players traded and resupplied here, the NPCs who were living in the War Fortress also came in, this was how the current Level 1 Supply Zone was created.</p><br/><p>Hikikomaria spoke towards the party members.</p><br/><p>\u201cVision Enhancing Stones and other tools have been bought already with the party funds, we\u2019ll rest here for 30 minutes so prepare the things you need by yourselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were a few things that were a necessity in the Maze.</p><br/><p>The Vision Enhancing tone, which increased how far they could see, or the Alarming Stone, which alerted one from sneak attacks, there were countless magic artifacts the mages of the kingdoms in Exodus created and sold.</p><br/><p>And since such things were a necessity for the whole group, they could be bought with the limited party funds but personal requirements and preparations were all up to oneself.</p><br/><p>Since this game had a tremendous amount of freedom, there were simply countless different types of battle styles.</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded.</p><br/><p>30 minutes.</p><br/><p>30 minutes was more than enough to do what he needed.</p><br/><p>There was no need for him to prepare gears really.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, I don\u2019t really have gold either.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo smiled.</p><br/><p>He was penniless so he didn\u2019t even have the money to buy them.</p><br/><p>Since this place, Level 1 Supply Zone, was a place which only sold necessary items so their prices weren\u2019t exactly low.</p><br/><p>Well, it was closer to the price of items in tourist locations.</p><br/><p>Hansoo exclaimed out at the price of numerous price signs while moving through people as he found a grave at the center of the village and nodded.</p><br/><p>\u2018Found it.\u2019</p><br/><p>Though the Level 1 Supply Zone was created by the hands of players and NPCs, they didn\u2019t just make it anywhere.</p><br/><p>Before this place had been built into the Supply Zone, it was actually the location where the most amount of people had died at.</p><br/><p>Countless players have melted down from the poison damage of the mysterious, infected warriors who poured out from the small pyramid structure in the middle.</p><br/><p>Only after the mages of the kingdoms released cures for the poison and when the high level players got interested by the maze did the jewel deep inside that pyramid get broken.</p><br/><p>Of course the construction of this Supply Zone in the largest area within the 1st floor was way after this.</p><br/><p>As Hansoo was walking.</p><br/><p>Somebody came up to him and started to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your first time in the Great Maze right? Let\u2019s go together, I\u2019ll help you prepare.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Crap.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo shook his head as he looked at his newly acquired annoyance.</p><br/><p>The female who had taken the test with him, [Kameira], was smiling next to him.</p><br/><p>With a very amused expression.</p><br/><p>Hansoo replied expressionlessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve prepared everything I needed already. I\u2019m just planning to go to that grave over there, it seems interesting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat pyramid?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kameira looked at Hansoo flirtatiously and then spoke:</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha! There\u2019s nothing there anymore! The ones who cleared it in the beginning...Well it seems they received a large amount of rewards but nothing is there anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed Hansoo had been trying to find the remnant of a quest in there.</p><br/><p>Of course Hansoo wasn\u2019t the only person who thought this way.</p><br/><p>Since Kameira was also curious and had looked all over that pyramid.</p><br/><p>Just because the ones who cleared it first got large rewards did not mean every secret inside it had been found.</p><br/><p>But everyone had failed.</p><br/><p>Countless people have searched inside the pyramid for a long time but they had all failed.</p><br/><p>Hansoo smiled at Kameira and then mumbled.</p><br/><p>\u2018You can only find it if you know what you\u2019re looking for.\u2019</p><br/><p>One can only see as much as they know.</p><br/><p>Since an item that looked like trash in the eyes of the common people may be a heavenly treasure to experts.</p><br/><p>Though the Players have been in this game for a long time, they were still noobs when it came to this world.</p><br/><p>Since they only thought of this world as a game.</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t interested in the race and the history of this world nor did they even want to know about it.</p><br/><p>Even if they were interested, they didn\u2019t dwell too much or pry too deeply.</p><br/><p>But of course there were exceptions.</p><br/><p>There were a few players out of the countless who were intrigued by this world and solely focused on research and adventures.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well. I don\u2019t remember their ID though.\u2019</p><br/><p>A year from now.</p><br/><p>Their leveling was slow due to their focus in exploration but they barely met the level requirements for the War Fortress and made their way to this Great Maze.</p><br/><p>He will then find the traces that will start the Great Change.</p><br/><p>Unlike the other players, whose goals were just the Protection Elixirs and Quests, his objectives were much different.</p><br/><p>And there were indeed such traces inside the Pyramid.</p><br/><p>It looked run down but those traces were necessary to begin these quests.</p><br/><p>Hansoo finished his thoughts as he shrugged his shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho knows.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kameia chuckled at Hansoo and then followed after him.</p><br/><p>She was interested.</p><br/><p>She was famous for her reasoning skills where she had come from but this guy was different.</p><br/><p>Kameia decided to get closer and continued to ask questions.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow old are you anyway?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess about 21.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kameia made a dumbfounded expression.</p><br/><p>\u2018...About? With that physique?\u2019</p><br/><p>Guessing one\u2019s age was secondary but for him to be 21 with his looks.</p><br/><p>Due to his huge posture and muscles that radiated fierceness, there was no way one would look at him and think him to be 21.</p><br/><p>\u2018It doesn\u2019t seem like he customized his looks.\u2019</p><br/><p>The Exodus did not provide the option to customize one\u2019s looks so one would need to buy surgery or elixirs for them.</p><br/><p>Kameia stared at Hansoo, who didn\u2019t have any traces of such work done to him, and then smiled.</p><br/><p>Since age wasn\u2019t very important.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s drop the formalities since we\u2019re of the same age. It seems like you\u2019re from Goryu as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo flinched at the name of the unfamiliar country which he hadn\u2019t heard in a long time.</p><br/><p>\u2018Oh yeah. I heard that this nation\u2019s history is a bit different than ours.\u2019</p><br/><p>He had heard that their culture was more western than Korea.</p><br/><p>Which meant that being informal was more common in that country.</p><br/><p>Hansoo pondered as to whether he should continue being formal or informal but then spoke out.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no. I\u2019m more comfortable being formal.\u201d</p><br/><p>The formal speech was uncomfortable but she would continue to stick by if he let her in like this.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hnng. Did the fact that I\u2019m a noona* get found out? I look quite young for my age though.\u2019</p><br/><p>She had faked her age in order to get closer but she was sad that he had walled her off.</p><br/><p>Then the entrance of the Pyramid appeared in front of Hansoo\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s go in.\u2019</p><br/><p>As he was about to.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop. You must pay the fee to tour the Pyramid. 10 gold.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Was it always like this?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo frowned.</p><br/><p>Actually he had never been to the Great Maze in the past.</p><br/><p>Since the 6th Great Change had been going on when he had come up here in the past.</p><br/><p>Since the Protection Elixir\u2019s prices had dropped so much, there wasn\u2019t really a need to go into the Great Maze.</p><br/><p>He had only memorized the core parts of the Quest, he didn\u2019t care about small things like this.</p><br/><p>Hansoo frowned as he felt his empty pockets.</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t prepared any gold since he would get some while hunting in the Maze but for such a thing like this to happen.</p><br/><p>The NPC who had been working as a guard looked at this Hansoo and then frowned as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cDue to a large amount of people visiting, the Kingdoms decided to place a maintenance fee.\u201d</p><br/><p>The NPC emphasized on the word .</p><br/><p>Though 10 gold wasn\u2019t a large amount of money, there were a lot of immortals, the title given to Players by the NPCs, who were too cheap or caused a ruckus because they didn\u2019t like being told by others.</p><br/><p>The guard judged Hansoo to be one of those people and spoke out in order to prevent trouble.</p><br/><p>Since even the immortal players would have a hard time ignoring the words of the Kingdoms.</p><br/><p>At that moment Kameira smiled as she handed over the money.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere, 20 gold.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you. Have a nice tour. The time limit is 10 minutes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...\u201d</p><br/><p>Kameira smiled as she looked at Hansoo who was staring at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou told me you had no money after crossing the border. I can pay this much. Oh and since I\u2019m the noona, I\u2019ll speak comfortably.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018...How sly.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo shook his head at Kameira who had shoved her way in and caused him to be in debt.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pay you back soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe. It\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo entered the Pyramid along with Kameria.</p><br/><p>She wouldn\u2019t cause much trouble for him anyway.</p><br/><p>Since it wasn\u2019t like he was going to do something big.</p><br/><p>As Hansoo was about to move out.</p><br/><p>He heard people mumbling in the distance.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hmm?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s supernatural hearing caught the speech of the people from the village.</p><br/><p>The people\u2019s talks rang throughout the entire space.</p><br/><p>Bug players.</p><br/><p>The Protection Elixirs were important.</p><br/><p>But bug players had a value far higher.</p><br/><p>Beside the artifacts they gave, the amount of experience they gave was far higher.</p><br/><p>Killing them was basically winning the lottery.</p><br/><p>A large amount of movement had been caused by this.</p><br/><p>Because of this huge lottery which had made their way into the Pyramid.</p><br/><p>Kameira went into the Pyramid while listening to the mumbles as she clicked her tongue.</p><br/><p>\u201cHnng. What trash. For them to use bugs because they don\u2019t have skills.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bug players.</p><br/><p>They were merely trash unlike the others who constantly struggled in order to live.</p><br/><p>\u2018Sigh. Anyways...If it\u2019s ten then it\u2019s highly likely it\u2019s those guys.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo frowned as he looked at the Supply Zone which had become busy.</p><br/><p>For those who aren\u2019t familiar with Korean culture : There is an informal and formal speech. Formal speech is used in a situation where respect is needed while the informal speech is more so between close friends or when you\u2019re berating others if you aren\u2019t close. It is seen as highly disrespectful when one is using informal speech when they aren\u2019t close to each other. the And those who are older are given titles? Noona is how a younger male describes an older female.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

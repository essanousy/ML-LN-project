There\u2019s a natural enemy for everything.\u2019</p><br/><p>The Satellite Fortress wasn\u2019t an organism but such thoughts still came up inside Karhal\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>And soon.</p><br/><p>Koooooong</p><br/><p>A 2km tall humanoid creature that came out from the egg stood up above the Silver Sea.</p><br/><p>And people slowly backed away and frowned.</p><br/><p>\u2018....Who is it?\u2019</p><br/><p>Tight muscles and a crown on top.</p><br/><p>It was clear that it wasn\u2019t Metiron who had gone in.</p><br/><p>Since he wouldn\u2019t be wearing such a crown.</p><br/><p>And he was too muscular to be a Sage.</p><br/><p>They heard that the bodies of the Sages had not developed as much because the existence of mana.</p><br/><p>The organism that was standing up above the Silver Sea, the Gael-Tara, crouched down and slowly reached for the egg shell.</p><br/><p>Shwooooosh</p><br/><p>Due to its size, a tsunami was created for its every move.</p><br/><p>As soon as Gael-Tara touched the shell.</p><br/><p>Shurrrrk!</p><br/><p>The shell fragments turned into liquids and gathered into the giant man\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>Into a giant bludgeon.</p><br/><p>An extremely muscular body and a bludgeon in his hand.</p><br/><p>His look was like that of a barbarian minus the crown on his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The people started to chuckle at this sight.</p><br/><p>They knew that they shouldn\u2019t be laughing in a situation like this but this sight was too funny.</p><br/><p>To have eaten the entire Satellite Fortress and to become but a barbarian.</p><br/><p>It was quite funny.</p><br/><p>And the Satellite Fortresses which had stopped its assault due to the overheated engines helped out in releasing the tense situation with the silence that followed it.</p><br/><p>But within that small moment.</p><br/><p>The Gael-Tara roared out and then jumped up into the skies.</p><br/><p>Roooooarrr!</p><br/><p>\u201cUaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck! Group up!\u201d</p><br/><p>The earthquake from a 2km giant jumping into the skies was tremendous.</p><br/><p>Ruuumblee!</p><br/><p>Rumble!</p><br/><p>While the people the freaking out from the waves and the earthquake.</p><br/><p>Whoooosh!</p><br/><p>The Gael-Tara crossed multiple kilometers with a single leap and then jumped on top of the Satellite Fortresses after crossing over the Silver Sea and the mountains.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Whoooooooosh!</p><br/><p>The bludgeon from its hand smashed down onto the Satellite Fortresses.</p><br/><p>The tremendous strength enforced by mana and hundreds of thousands of tons of mass along with the added velocity.</p><br/><p>Boooooom!</p><br/><p>\u201cUaaaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>The defence of the Satellite Fortresses could live up to its name of a Fortress.</p><br/><p>And this Satellite Fortress got smashed apart by a single attack of the bludgeon and fell on the ground.</p><br/><p>No, it was more like it got smashed down into the ground instead of falling.</p><br/><p>Booooom!</p><br/><p>\u201cUaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>Another quake from the Satellite Fortress smashing down onto the ground like an asteroid swept past the adventurers.</p><br/><p>Nobody had died because they were all prepared for this but the situation was still extremely grim.</p><br/><p>Everyone made an expression of despair.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy god\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ekidu exclaimed out.</p><br/><p>The ones who had gathered here were the elites of the elites.</p><br/><p>Since they were handpicked by her.</p><br/><p>But such things were meaningless in front of a formidable monster.</p><br/><p>And it didn\u2019t even care to attack them.</p><br/><p>It was solely focused on destroying the Satellite Fortresses in front of it.</p><br/><p>And they had to exert all their strength to barely hold on during the shockwaves created.</p><br/><p>Ekidu couldn\u2019t even imagine what the result would be if that bludgeon was swung against them.</p><br/><p>As Ekidu was making an expression full of fear while staring at the fallen Satellite Fortress.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh...Uhhh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUhhh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kuuudududuk</p><br/><p>Uuudududuk</p><br/><p>\u201cOh no\u2026\u201d.</p><br/><p>Ekidu also exclaimed out as she saw this.</p><br/><p>Gael-Tara didn\u2019t even go for the other Satellite Fortresses after smashing down that single one.</p><br/><p>Its next actions were quite shocking.</p><br/><p>It started to eat it.</p><br/><p>Crunch</p><br/><p>Cruunnch</p><br/><p>Rip apart the outer layers and eat the inner parts.</p><br/><p>Pull out the mana engine and gulp down.</p><br/><p>Its silver skin darkened every time it took a part of the Satellite Fortress and the blue light surrounding it got deeper as well.</p><br/><p>Enkidu mumbled as she looked at the barbarian chewing up the Satellite Fortress.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt devours...an entire civilization.\u201d</p><br/><p>She finally realized why it had the look of a barbarian when it came out from the egg.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>Boooooooom!</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>While the outside was in chaos.</p><br/><p>A fight was happening inside the Satellite Fortress within the corridors that had still remained intact.</p><br/><p>Between Hansoo who was trying to go through the corridors and to the center and hundreds of Metiron\u2019s underlings.</p><br/><p>Uuudududuk!</p><br/><p>Kwajijijik!</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t really speak to each other.</p><br/><p>They were just fighting in order to beat the other side.</p><br/><p>They swung their spears and swords and shot out skills in order to kill each other.</p><br/><p>The Pandemic Blade\u2019s spores rushed in to melt the opponent's lungs and skins and skills of multiple colors smashed into Hansoo\u2019s Thousand Soldiers Armor and the Dragon Essence Blade.</p><br/><p>Actually Hansoo had long turned into a dragonoid with the Racial Metamorphosis.</p><br/><p>Since this was the only way for him to withstand the enemies\u2019s attacks.</p><br/><p>Crunch!</p><br/><p>Uuudududk!</p><br/><p>\u2018They\u2019re quite strong.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo mumbled as he cut through one enemy\u2019s neck by swinging with his Forked Lightning and threw the corpse to block the skills.</p><br/><p>Every one of them were stronger than Dakidus when he fought him in the past.</p><br/><p>They had raised the mastery of their skills to the extremes and trained their martial skills to the brim over ten years in the Otherworld.</p><br/><p>And they picked up top notch skills and artifacts from killing humans.</p><br/><p>Along with the teamwork created from being in the same clan.</p><br/><p>It would be weird if they weren\u2019t weak.</p><br/><p>But that was it.</p><br/><p>Crunch!</p><br/><p>Hansoo smashed apart another head and then strode forward.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m stronger.\u2019</p><br/><p>Erase the skills flying in from the distance with the Power Destruction and distort the perceptions of the ones closer up and then smash them apart.</p><br/><p>Block the excess skills flying in with the Thousand Soldiers Armor and fill up the falling health with the vampiric powers.*</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t even a need to use the Red Zone power of the Nurmaha\u2019s Ring, the Hemorrhage.</p><br/><p>The Forked Lightning being swung by the body which had been enhanced by the Body Enhancement Surgery, Dragon Essence Blade and Racial Metamorphosis.</p><br/><p>And the power of the Demonic Dragon\u2019s Reinforcement and the Pandemic Blade.</p><br/><p>Once the countless battle experience and instincts he had gathered over decades were added onto this, there was really no reason to delay any further with the Hemorrhage.</p><br/><p>One attack, one kill.</p><br/><p>Kwaaduk!</p><br/><p>Uuuudududuk!</p><br/><p>Hansoo received the attacks flying in with his body and then continued to stride forward while smashing them apart.</p><br/><p>Actually this was more than enough to cause them to run away really.</p><br/><p>But his enemies didn\u2019t falter as they continued to charge forward and Hansoo kept on snapping their necks without a single moment of hesitation.</p><br/><p>Since every second was precious.</p><br/><p>\u2018I need to hurry and deal with that Metiron guy.\u2019</p><br/><p>Rooooarrrr!</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>Countless shockwaves and sounds of explosions could be felt from the outside.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo could feel that the beast was getting stronger.</p><br/><p>It was just eating the Satellite Fortresses because it couldn\u2019t suppress its gluttony but once it eats them all up, its rage will be directed to other organisms.</p><br/><p>And it wouldn\u2019t even take 10 minutes to erase all the humans and Sages then.</p><br/><p>Since they had all gathered together conveniently.</p><br/><p>After a while of charging forward and smashing apart people.</p><br/><p>\u2018I can see it!\u2019</p><br/><p>The broken metal door and the bright interior behind it.</p><br/><p>There were only about 10 people left now.</p><br/><p>As Hansoo was about to attack the person in front of him with the spear.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop! Get back!\u201d</p><br/><p>A loud shout could be heard from the distance.</p><br/><p>The ten clansmen suddenly stopped and backed off.</p><br/><p>As if they were waiting for it.</p><br/><p>At the same time.</p><br/><p>Whoooooosh!</p><br/><p>A seven colored light shot through the corridor where the ten people disappeared from.</p><br/><p>A light that seemed similar to the Quintuple beam of Karhal.</p><br/><p>But as soon as Hansoo saw it.</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s expression changed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Seven Strands Spear!\u2019</p><br/><p>Solo Numbering 5.</p><br/><p>A beam of laser that was solely created for destruction.</p><br/><p>Actually its attacks even surpassed the number 3 skill, Elemental Outfit.</p><br/><p>Hansoo raised his spear and blocked it in a hurry.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Booooom!</p><br/><p>The seven colored light which had even melted down the walls as it flew past smashed into him.</p><br/><p>Tadadadadak</p><br/><p>The Demonic Dragon Reinforcement got swept apart as the dragon scales, Thousand Soldiers Armor and the Dragon Essence Blade got smashed apart and melted down.</p><br/><p>Hansoo stared at the person who had sent out the attack after withstanding the pain from the attack.</p><br/><p>For it to be this strong even if it was a high level skill.</p><br/><p>And the Seven Strands Spear was famous for draining the user\u2019s mana.</p><br/><p>Such powers couldn\u2019t be shown from just having 100% of the Yellow Zone\u2019s mana runes.</p><br/><p>Metiron smiled as he looked at Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been a bit late due to receiving the present I received. Apparently its much better than the Mana Pool.\u201d</p><br/><p>A strange symbol could be shown near the heart of Metiron.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo finally realized how Metiron could handle such a large amount of mana as he looked at the symbol.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

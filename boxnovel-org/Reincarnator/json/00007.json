A unique sour smell was not in the air and the markings are only on the ground. If it was the black snail you would see the mucus on the walls as well.</p><br/><p>It isn\u2019t Chopped Up Zombies either. Because then the markings on the ground would be half mucus and half intestines.</p><br/><p>Then only one choice remains.</p><br/><p>\u2018Land Mermaid?\u2019</p><br/><p>Land Mermaid.</p><br/><p>This is actually more like a nickname.</p><br/><p>Their upper body was a unique shaped human and their lower body was like a grub, from one angle it would look like a mermaid that had been dropped onto the land.</p><br/><p>To drag their heavy lower body across the floor with their hands, the strength of their hands was very developed and the paralyzing poison that came out of their lower body was dangerous.</p><br/><p>Their lower body was heavy and the speed of dragging themselves across the floor was only slightly faster than walking but if you aren\u2019t ready and get shot by the paralysis poison, you will witness the sight of your body getting ripped apart by these guys.</p><br/><p>Hansoo made an unsightly face after seeing the overall state.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is a tutorial area with a high difficulty\u2019</p><br/><p>If every tutorial area\u2019s monsters were different then their difficulties were different as well.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not an opponent that you cannot win against but it was indeed a problem to deal with.</p><br/><p>The Goblin and the Green Worm are similar in terms of physical ability and aren\u2019t that bad when dealing face to face but the consequences could be dire if you don\u2019t know about them.</p><br/><p>And because it\u2019s the the first day newbie adventurers not knowing was definite.</p><br/><p>When he had first come here, the tutorial stage ended before he came to the train station so he didn\u2019t know but it was set up with rather troublesome mobs.</p><br/><p>\u2018I guess I need a little more preparation.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo stopped and then returned back to the convenience store.</p><br/><p>The three who had been following mumbled quietly.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026It is that psychic power again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys come and help too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo returned, gathered all the Soju (Korean Alcoholic Beverage), flipped them upside down and started to empty them.</p><br/><p>Gluglugluglug</p><br/><p>\u2018They did say it would be here\u2026. but why is something like this here.\u2019</p><br/><p>He did heard it from the team he made the plans with but after seeing the paint thinner in the corner Hansoo smirked and laughed. (*TL: Paint Thinner is Extremely Flammable and EXPLOSIVE)</p><br/><p>After he emptied the Soju bottles, he filled them with the paint thinner.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is there no diesel around.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo just replaced it with a cheaper version and poured some of the sesame oil in the corner then plugged the top with tissue.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Where did you learn how to make a molotov cocktail?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you live in Korea you should at least know this much. We need to make as much as available.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the four made it together, it was done quickly.</p><br/><p>Hansoo got the lighters from the side of the counter, handed them one each then gathered the molotovs in two backpacks and another bag and talked to the three.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne will throw the molotov and the three will stand in the front. The Rune displacement will be less for the person on the back who is on the safer location. Anybody up for it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Taesoon, who heard that the rune displacement was low, stood without words but Sangjin and Mihee raised their hands slowly.</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked at the two and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet into a consensus, as to who will throw.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangjin knitted his brows for a moment but since he couldn\u2019t bicker with the beauty he was about to lower his hand.</p><br/><p>When Mihee was about to make a sigh of relief Hansoo threw out another word as a bonus.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs a reminder, it will become much more dangerous from now on. Instead of saying let\u2019s trade during the fight decide carefully now.\u201d</p><br/><p>At those words Sangjin, who was about to lower his hands, stopped and Mihee looked at Hansoo with a resentful face.</p><br/><p>Mihee looked at Sangjin with a desperate face but when Sangjin had no looks of backing down she just gave up.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take turns with it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Alright.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangjin thought for a moment but since he didn\u2019t want to bicker around he agreed with those terms.</p><br/><p>\u2018Should I just go up\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Sangjin pondered for a moment after hearing that it was dangerous but then shook his head.</p><br/><p>It felt like if you followed Hansoo something amazing will come out. He also wanted to be part of that.</p><br/><p>\u2018It seems like he shares it fairly so\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>If he lent a hand, would they throw him out.</p><br/><p>He did say it was dangerous but he could easily run from the molotov throwing position in case of danger.</p><br/><p>Sangjin gulped his saliva then slowly headed into the darkness.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Kuduk</p><br/><p>\u201cUaaak! Throw it! Throw it this way!\u201d</p><br/><p>Taesoon screamed as he saw the monster crawling towards him over the stones.</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s poison was very strong.</p><br/><p>Even if they were scratched they would still turn and twist around their bodies.</p><br/><p>It definitely was worth paying runes for it.</p><br/><p>But the problem sprang out somewhere else.</p><br/><p>Whilst fighting joyfully, a paralysis poison sketched by his leg.</p><br/><p>Taesoon had already been shot in one of his legs so his movements were not completely free.</p><br/><p>\u2018Goddamit! I fell for it even though I knew about it!\u2019</p><br/><p>Even though Hansoo had gone out to the front and showed how they spat it out but since the look of them crawling over the ground was funny, he was caught off guard.</p><br/><p>Thankfully the location he got shot didn\u2019t melt or anything but the mobs who spread out their long arms and approached in strides were fear itself.</p><br/><p>Them, who had looked slow before, are now almost like grim reapers.</p><br/><p>\u201cuaaaah\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangjin who had been fumbling around, barely lit the fire then threw it towards the location where the Land Mermaids were gathering.</p><br/><p>Chuuuung!</p><br/><p>As the molotov exploded, pieces of flame scattered everywhere.</p><br/><p>Keeeeeeeek!</p><br/><p>As their skin dried up, they twisted their bodies as if it was painful.</p><br/><p>Kudududuk</p><br/><p>And at that moment Hansoo ran around between the Land Mermaids and smashed the heads.</p><br/><p>Since the edge was dulled it didn\u2019t cut well but when the Podao was swingged with enhanced strength, it had no problem getting through the skin and muscle.</p><br/><p>One strike One kill.</p><br/><p>Honestly it didn\u2019t matter if they didn\u2019t die in one strike.</p><br/><p>The poison on the blade stimulated their nerves and gave them insane amounts of pain.</p><br/><p>The Land Mermaids still shot out paralysis poison and stretched out their arms but Hansoo dodged most of it and the rest he deflected with a piece of goblin leather.</p><br/><p>\u2018Does that guy have eyes on the back of his head?\u2019</p><br/><p>Taesoon spun his tongue around as he looked at Hansoo.</p><br/><p>As Hansoo finished them off and all the enemies disappeared they finally sat on the ground as if the tension was released.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuuah\u2026 Huaahhh\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRest a while then bring the runes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Taesoon walked towards Hansoo who was distributing the runes though he was tired.</p><br/><p>At first he was suspicious that he would cheat them but as he perfectly distributed them he stopped worrying.</p><br/><p>As if he was looking at the whole warfield the whole time, he knew exactly how many one killed and how much one contributed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Goddamit, it isn\u2019t much.\u2019</p><br/><p>After getting shot by the paralysis shot, he fought while dragging his foot so the amount of runes he acquired was much less in comparison to the floor above.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fuck\u2026 the physical difference between us is increasing.\u2019</p><br/><p>The one who killed takes the runes.</p><br/><p>But the combination of the kills of the three was not even a quarter of what Hansoo killed.</p><br/><p>And thanks to that the speed at which he hunted increased more and more.</p><br/><p>As Hansoo\u2019s physical stats rose, it was like he cast off iron chains and was flying around.</p><br/><p>\u201cEey, fucktard!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Taesoon felt something boiling up from this chest, he looked at Sangjin and then shouted at him in anger.</p><br/><p>Sangjin couldn\u2019t even throw a molotov properly because he got scared by a Land Mermaid that was walking towards him.</p><br/><p>Even though he was a friend since he couldn\u2019t even do that properly while they fought with their lives on the line, Taesoon\u2019s anger exploded.</p><br/><p>\u201cUuuu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As Sangjin made a sorry expression Hansoo spoke while looking at Sangjin.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome and take the runes. The recovery will be faster after you raise the stamina\u201d</p><br/><p>And after Hansoo concluded his words, he started to cut the belly of the Land Mermaids.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s see. If you open the area between their rear end and the belly button\u2026 it\u2019s here.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo took out the paralysis poison sac from between the slit of the stomach, carefully shrouded with goblin leather then started to carefully squeeze it out as if he was making medicine and poured it into an empty shampoo container he brought.</p><br/><p>Though it wasn\u2019t useful against the Land Mermaids it was definitely useful against the life forms of the third floor.</p><br/><p>Taesoon then looked at his and Sangjin\u2019s runes by Hansoo\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>\u2018If I take those runes too\u2026 I can somewhat catch up.\u2019</p><br/><p>Taesoon\u2019s eyes shone as he screamed and marched on.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would you give it to a bitch like him! It\u2019s better for me to take it and fight!\u201d</p><br/><p>A sword stopped his way when he stomped towards the runes in anger.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Are you really going to be like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe distribution must be fair. You\u2019re not supposed to touch the food line.\u201d (*TL: Food line = a way for someone to survive)</p><br/><p>At those words Sangjin, who had been trembling in the back, slowly came to the front and took the runes that were considered his.</p><br/><p>Mihee, who was sighing, asked Hansoo cautiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it annoying or anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>Though they were fighting zealously but to Hansoo it was probably frustrating to no end but he did not get angry a single time and kept on heading down steadily.</p><br/><p>Hansoo merely shrugged his shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s this much it could be considered gentlemanly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Normal College students. They didn\u2019t even go to the military.</p><br/><p>Half were female.</p><br/><p>And they were dragged here with no form of preparation.</p><br/><p>Will it make sense to fight like a special forces warrior on the first day here against monsters who want to rip them apart.</p><br/><p>To those who were living a normal life before, that was a normal reaction.</p><br/><p>If it wasn\u2019t such a dire situation like this they would have never thought of holding a sword.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well I was crazy in the past so\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Even if he knew that he could only learn 7 skills he would have still learned Dororo Lizard\u2019s Essence.</p><br/><p>Because he was not in a situation where he could afford to not learn it.</p><br/><p>The days where he ran around barely holding onto his lifeline after learning a Lizard Essence were still remembered by him.</p><br/><p>Hansoo, who had finished his thoughts, looked at the three in front of him.</p><br/><p>Hansoo didn\u2019t have any plans about saying anything about things they couldn\u2019t do.</p><br/><p>As he lived through the abyss life, he found out that the ones that latched onto your ankles in the end were not the ones who were scared or weak near the beginning.</p><br/><p>Rather it was the ones that were fearless and strong that made problems.</p><br/><p>\u2018It doesn\u2019t matter if they can\u2019t do it\u201d</p><br/><p>As long as they have a limit to what they can\u2019t do.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t abandoning us, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mihee watched Hansoo with teary eyes and at those words Sangjin and Taesoon both jerked.</p><br/><p>Because they felt it through their body.</p><br/><p>The only reason they can remain friends and talk leisurely like this was due to Hansoo.</p><br/><p>Then Hansoo smirked.</p><br/><p>\u2018It seems like they\u2019ve got the wrong idea.\u2019</p><br/><p>He never took them in so what would he be abandoning?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou three are doing well enough so don\u2019t worry. Since we\u2019ve rested somewhat let\u2019s continue forward.\u201d</p><br/><p>These were not empty words, the three were not at the level of grabbing onto ankles.</p><br/><p>Even if Hansoo fought alone the speed would\u2019ve been around the same. From another point of view he was able to move about more freely because the three took away some of the attention.</p><br/><p>If the number of monsters were limited it would be different. The only thing that they weren\u2019t short of were monsters and the important thing was how many runes you took in the limited time.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s see\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo checked his stats as he picked up his runes.</p><br/><p>[Kang Hansoo]</p><br/><p>Strength: 25.3</p><br/><p>Stamina: 24.5</p><br/><p>Agility: 14.1</p><br/><p>Perception: 15.2</p><br/><p>\u2018As I expected\u2019</p><br/><p>Though it was random you couldn\u2019t ignore the specialties of the entity.</p><br/><p>The Land Mermaids had high strength and stamina. It seemed like he had gained a lot of strength and stamina in a short amount of time.</p><br/><p>\u2018It isn\u2019t bad\u2019</p><br/><p>Rather strength and stamina were more important right now.</p><br/><p>Agility and perception runes had a good effect but he can replace them with battle skills and experience.</p><br/><p>But on the other hand the strength to get through the armor and the stamina that helped with healing and the duration of how long one swings their sword was more important during the fight.</p><br/><p>\u2018And another thing\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo moved his hands towards the last stamina rune on the ground anxiously.</p><br/><p>And that moment Hansoo\u2019s stamina rose from 24.5 to 24.8.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s above 50\u2019</p><br/><p>The moment the addition of Strength and Stamina rose above 50 the air suddenly stretched apart.</p><br/><p>And that the same time a familiar yet unsightly face came out.</p><br/><p>\u2018A mission has been given.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo smiled at the Fairy that had appeared in front of his eyes.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

What a monster. There shouldn\u2019t be any issues right?\u2019</p><br/><p>The woman who was running, Einchel, mumbled inwardly.</p><br/><p>She was extremely worried only leaving behind Hansoo and the Ain to deal with a heavenly disaster of a being.</p><br/><p>But she soon shook her head.</p><br/><p>She wouldn\u2019t be much help in dealing with such a monster of a being.</p><br/><p>She would only get in their way.</p><br/><p>And she had to focus on her own objective.</p><br/><p>There was no time to play around.</p><br/><p>This tunnel had been created while Krancheska climbed down.</p><br/><p>Of course it was connected to the center of the War fortress.</p><br/><p>\u2018If I drop my guard then...I\u2019ll die.\u2019</p><br/><p>Einchel slowed down as she got closer to the gaping hole through which sunlight shone.</p><br/><p>And carefully climbed up while using all of her stealth skills to their utmost.</p><br/><p>The further she went up and the closer she got to the hole, more and more noises poured into her ears.</p><br/><p>The shouts of the players and the residents of the War Fortress.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go out! Come on! They\u2019re giving out quests!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJackpot! They give this much even if we just participate?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYo! Tell all the clansmen to come as well! This actually seems like a jackpot!\u201d</p><br/><p>Einchel frowned as she heard these words.</p><br/><p>\u2018...They\u2019re using them well huh.\u2019</p><br/><p>Though they were weak, they were still immortal and had many in numbers.</p><br/><p>Though the high-level powerhouses of the kingdoms ignored them because they were merely bugs, even bugs would become terrifying if there was a huge number of them.</p><br/><p>And these guys had no fear of death which was an important factor in a battle.</p><br/><p>It meant that these guys were very good meat shields.</p><br/><p>The Kingdoms knew this so they were attracting the players from all around with a tremendous amount of treasures and rewards.</p><br/><p>It meant that they didn\u2019t want the Ains to reach the Spirit Land that much.</p><br/><p>Though the Ains were handling the forces of the kingdoms pretty well, the situation didn\u2019t look very good for them to celebrate just yet.</p><br/><p>Because if the players rushed towards them like waves then the Ains wouldn\u2019t be able to block them either.</p><br/><p>Einchel thought of what Hansoo had said to her before she left.</p><br/><p>Like what Hansoo had said, Einchel carefully climbed up to the War Fortress.</p><br/><p>And after coming up to the fortress, she could finally see the situation.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Jesus. I\u2019ve never seen it being so empty.\u2019</p><br/><p>The War Fortress, which had always been packed tightly, was empty.</p><br/><p>From the guards who watched over the walls to the players who looked for quests.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is why it was so easy to climb up.\u2019</p><br/><p>Einchel mumbled.</p><br/><p>Of course it wasn\u2019t entirely empty but compared to the usual War Fortress, this was the same as a deserted town.</p><br/><p>\u2018It should be a bit easier to move around now\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>There was no time to waste.</p><br/><p>Since the adventurers of the Ant Tunnels would\u2019ve spread out far and wide already.</p><br/><p>A risky choice the 800 of them had made due to the amount of work they had to do within this vast area in a short amount of time.</p><br/><p>Einchel quickly looked over the area and started to run towards the center.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>One of the players who had seen Einchel looked to her in confusion.</p><br/><p>\u2018What the hell?\u2019</p><br/><p>Everyone was running out from the War Fortress.</p><br/><p>Everybody including the ones who had been here originally and the ones who came in through the warp gates.</p><br/><p>But for somebody to run to the center of the plaza.</p><br/><p>\u2018And I feel like I saw her before.\u2019</p><br/><p>As the player, Karax, was lost in confusion.</p><br/><p>One of the party members next to Karax tapped his shoulder and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cYo, What are you doing? There\u2019s no time. We have to go out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Though the history and battle-related quests were famous for having a large amount of rewards for participating, they were even more famous for their penalties.</p><br/><p>Penalty.</p><br/><p>A system which was applied when they did not participate.</p><br/><p>Of course they didn\u2019t pick on them or kill them one by one, but the players would face an annoying situation after the quests end.</p><br/><p>Like the prices of the stores increasing or warping to certain areas being banned.</p><br/><p>Though this could buy the hatred of the players, it wasn\u2019t like they really died from the battle and since the rewards were good, most players participated anyway.</p><br/><p>Karax nodded at the party member\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>His words were right.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well. She probably has her own issues to deal with.\u2019</p><br/><p>Participating in the quest outside was of more importance.</p><br/><p>But then Karax suddenly stopped.</p><br/><p>\u201cYo. I figured out where I saw that girl before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat. Is she like your ex or something?\u201d</p><br/><p>While his party membered laughed at Karax, he replied with a serious face.</p><br/><p>\u201cBlacklist. The most recent one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>All the party members stopped.</p><br/><p>By saying recent, he was talking about the blacklist that was updated an hour ago.</p><br/><p>A huge incident where tens of thousands of players who had been trapped in the Great Maze got massacred.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t like the war had started so due to such a large amount of people dying in such a short amount of time, the clans and groups all went into emergencies and looked into the situation.</p><br/><p>And everyone made shocked expressions when they figured out who had caused all this.</p><br/><p>Bug players.</p><br/><p>The close to one thousand bug players, who had been hiding in the corners of the maze, had done all this.</p><br/><p>Some people were even suspicious that this incident was the Ant Eater clan trying to broaden their powers.</p><br/><p>The bug players were merely cockroaches inside the normal player\u2019s minds, not something which would bite them back.</p><br/><p>And for them to cause such a massacre with just a thousand in number.</p><br/><p>No matter how strong they were, they couldn\u2019t be that strong.</p><br/><p>But soon their questions were answered.</p><br/><p>The evidence from various groups had surfaced.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>And a clear reward had been set.</p><br/><p>The Kingdom\u2019s pride had been hurt so this was a decision they made to catch and massacre them all.</p><br/><p>And there were a few other benefits.</p><br/><p>Killing them was not a matter of experience and artifacts anymore.</p><br/><p>The party members standing next to Karax looked at him in delight.</p><br/><p>\u201cNice, how did you see that? Not bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeheh. I knew this bastard would achieve something one day.\u201d</p><br/><p>Karax\u2019s confidence spiked up as he spoke with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo? You\u2019re going to go out? To that battlefield?\u201d</p><br/><p>The 50 or so party members chuckled to each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell. That can wait a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Boooooom!</p><br/><p>Booom!</p><br/><p>\u201cCatch her! Hey! Catch that girl! She\u2019s a bug player!\u201d</p><br/><p>Karax shouted out loud while chasing Einchel throughout the plaza and pouring out skills.</p><br/><p>The surrounding players heard this one by one, looked at Einchel and then started to send out skills as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cWoah! It\u2019s the first time I saw\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Crunch!</p><br/><p>Einchel sent the head of a player charging towards her into a ball of golden light and grinded her teeth.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fucking bastards! They react too fast!\u2019</p><br/><p>Because the reaction of the Kingdoms and the Ant Eater clans were so quick, these players were chasing her much more actively.</p><br/><p>Her own level was at 240.</p><br/><p>And because her level had risen quite a lot compared to the past, her combat abilities rose a lot as well.</p><br/><p>She could handle the 50 or so chasing her from behind.</p><br/><p>But then?</p><br/><p>It was empty compared to the usual, it didn\u2019t mean it was completely empty.</p><br/><p>All the players remaining inside the War Fotress would charge towards her.</p><br/><p>And her objective wasn\u2019t to bicker around with these players.</p><br/><p>\u2018Thank god...That there\u2019s less of them.\u2019</p><br/><p>Einchel, who had been looking around with all of her scanning type skills, looked towards the plaza of the War Fortress and grinded her teeth.</p><br/><p>If the War Fortress was busy like the usual then she wouldn\u2019t even have been able to get this far.</p><br/><p>\u2018But...I\u2019m here!\u2019</p><br/><p>The moment Einchel stepped onto the center of the War Fortress, the plaza.</p><br/><p>Booooom!</p><br/><p>\u2018Fuck!\u2019</p><br/><p>A huge explosion occurred in front of Einchel and smashed her away.</p><br/><p>And Einchel\u2019s body rose up into the air from this.</p><br/><p>The players who were chasing Einchel look towards the person who attacked her in shock.</p><br/><p>\u2018The Ant Eater clans...They reset themselves and came here already?\u2019</p><br/><p>It costed more gold the longer the revival timer was.</p><br/><p>And the Gold and Scarlet Demons standing there was known to have been the first ones to get killed down below from the massacre.</p><br/><p>But even so, not a long time had been past which meant that those guys spent a tremendous amount of gold to get back here.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tsk. Nothing will be in it for us.\u2019</p><br/><p>As Karax clicked his tongue like looking at the Gold and Scarlet Demons who were surrounding Einchel.</p><br/><p>Sharon Stiller looked at Einchel, the person whom she had seen the moment she revived and the one of those who caused all this, and laughed in a cold manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow lucky. We see each other again. Anyways, I don\u2019t understand why you guys are spread out like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sharon Stiller had access to a large amount of information.</p><br/><p>And according to what she had heard, everybody was heading towards the plaza here.</p><br/><p>There was no reason why they would\u2019ve been split up like this if they didn\u2019t have any plans.</p><br/><p>Well, it didn't matter.</p><br/><p>If she waited here then she would be able to kill them off one by one.</p><br/><p>And as if Einchel read Sharon Stiller\u2019s minds, she chuckled and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you at least figure out why we\u2019re gathering to this place?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sharon Stiller frowned at Einchel\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u2018This bitch. Doesn\u2019t understand the situation huh. Well since you\u2019re first, you can tell us.\u2019</p><br/><p>Though her Spirit Stone hadn\u2019t recovered yet, she could easily handle this girl without it.</p><br/><p>Kiring!</p><br/><p>As Sharon Stiller pulled her sword out from the sheath and walked towards Einchel.</p><br/><p>Papapapat!</p><br/><p>Papapat!</p><br/><p>The entire plaza started to shine in golden light.</p><br/><p>Around Einchel.</p><br/><p>And around Sharon Stiller, the Gold and Scarlet Demons as well.</p><br/><p>Even around Karax and his party members.</p><br/><p>And everyone freaked out as they saw this.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe fuck! Is some clan coming over?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. This...Looks like a login?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way! How can they log in to the point of filling up the entire plaza!? How many are logging in\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As the people freaked out.</p><br/><p>Sharon Stiller clenched her teeth as she felt something ominous.</p><br/><p>The confident attitude of the girl in front of her.</p><br/><p>The girl probably knew about the current situation and was still that confident.</p><br/><p>And Sharon Stiller did not like her expression.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ll kill you before that. Try smiling after you get beheaded.\u2019</p><br/><p>Roaaarrr!</p><br/><p>Sharon Stiller\u2019s blade flew across the air along with a huge noise.</p><br/><p>Towards Einchel\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fuck!\u2019</p><br/><p>Einchel clenched her teeth and tried to back up.</p><br/><p>She wanted to buy some time while these guys were in a daze but for Sharon to just charge at her like this.</p><br/><p>She had long depleted her stamina running here.</p><br/><p>And her opponent was not some random player but a pro player whose job was killing people like her.</p><br/><p>\u2018Shit.\u2019</p><br/><p>As Einchel fell into despair while staring into the blade which smashed apart her skills and was heading towards her neck.</p><br/><p>Crunch!</p><br/><p>There was a hand which grabbed her arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sharon was startled as somebody who had grabbed her arm but soon frowned as she pushed forward.</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know who you are but...I\u2019m level 250!\u2019</p><br/><p>Uudududuk.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>She forcefully pushed through despite the arm grabbing her and then continued to slash.</p><br/><p>\u2018Try laughing you bitch.\u2019</p><br/><p>As Sharon was about to laugh for herself.</p><br/><p>Kwaduk.</p><br/><p>Kwaduduk.</p><br/><p>Over the hand which had grabbed her arm, dozens of other arms popped out and grabbed onto her.</p><br/><p>Arms from dozens of people who came out from the golden light.</p><br/><p>\u201cYo! Catch this bitch! Jesus, she\u2019s strong!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like this is the girl\u2026 Hey you, the girl over there. Are you the guide?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sharon could handle one but multiple dozens was a different story.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As sharon cursed out in a dumbfounded manner after being immobilized.</p><br/><p>The man who had grabbed onto her arm in the beginning shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! If they don\u2019t have the mark then kill them all! We\u2019re organizing this place first!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kwadududuk!</p><br/><p>\u2018Fucking seriously?...\u2019</p><br/><p>Hundreds of thousands of golden lights.</p><br/><p>Sharon Stiller fell into despair as she saw hundreds of spears flying at her.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I\u2019ve prepared quit a lot of\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Hansoo could even finish his words.</p><br/><p>Boooooom!</p><br/><p>A tremendously evil aura started to get radiated out from the Arklateori.</p><br/><p>Kuuuuuuuuu</p><br/><p>A dark aura that nothing up until now could come close to.</p><br/><p>Gwanje felt a chill run down his entire body.</p><br/><p>A dark aura that radiated throughout the entire battlefield.</p><br/><p>Gwanje clenched his teeth and muttered with an expression of disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why was he dealing with us using the Akadus\u2026When he was this strong?\u2019</p><br/><p>If he himself could wield such a tremendous amount of strength then he wouldn\u2019t have played around with the Akadus in the first place.</p><br/><p>He would just come out and kill them all off at once.</p><br/><p>And the aura he was feeling right now was that powerful.</p><br/><p>The adventurers throughout the battlefield also felt an aura and all made fearful expressions because they didn\u2019t know how to deal with this.</p><br/><p>The simple aura that had exploded out had driven out the thought of battle from their heads and instead replaced it with fear.</p><br/><p>During that short moment they had flinched at the aura.</p><br/><p>The movements of the surroundings Akadus changed</p><br/><p>\u201cUhh! What\u2019s going on with these things!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are they only attacking us suddenly!\u201d</p><br/><p>The target of the Akadus changed completely.</p><br/><p>Their main targets had been the Akarons who had taken the Berserk Emperor\u2019s Fluids and were charging towards them.</p><br/><p>But after the vicious aura exploded out from the inside of the factory.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t even take a glance at the Akarons as they only attacked the humans.</p><br/><p>Gwanje clenched his teeth at the sudden change of events.</p><br/><p>Hansoo analyzed these events that had suddenly occurred.</p><br/><p>\u2018She lost the body.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo spoke towards Gwanje.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake care of this place. Make sure nobody can come in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo then flew into the tunnel.</p><br/><p>Gwanje clenched his teeth as he saw this scene play out.</p><br/><p>\u2018Control this situation?\u2019</p><br/><p>Everyone was stealing glances and were caught in a chaotic situation due to the sudden explosive aura.</p><br/><p>How could they not.</p><br/><p>Even Gwanje himself had wanted to run away.</p><br/><p>At that moment a carrier pigeon flew into him.</p><br/><p>Pudududuk</p><br/><p>Gwanje turned solemn as he read the message.</p><br/><p>And then muttered with a very heavy expression.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hansoo you told me that you were fighting because you also had someone precious and dear to you.\u2019</p><br/><p>Then him choosing to defend his precious person was the right choice.</p><br/><p>The current chaotic situation was the best moment to escape.</p><br/><p>Gwanje clenched his teeth and carefully disappeared from the battlefield discreetly so others wouldn\u2019t realize.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Kugugugugugu</p><br/><p>Hansoo quietly muttered as he sensed the aura that was radiating from the distance while charging through the tunnel.</p><br/><p>\u2018He\u2019s doing it on purpose.\u2019</p><br/><p>He needed to ruthlessly charge forward.</p><br/><p>After a bit a familiar scene unfolded in front of his eyes.</p><br/><p>Soul Telautograph.</p><br/><p>Elkadion who was standing next to it and the collapsed body of the human.</p><br/><p>Galkima, who had taken Elkadion\u2019s body, looked at Hansoo and laughed out loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahahaha! I can figure it out to a degree now. As to how this one and you knew about me!\u201d</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t read her memories since it hadn\u2019t been long since he took over the body.</p><br/><p>But reading the most recent and vibrant memory that she had wasn\u2019t that hard.</p><br/><p>\u2018To return from the future after killing the Dragon race.\u2019</p><br/><p>This was why he was able to stay calm despite the difference in strength.</p><br/><p>Why would he fear someone like him if he had killed those of the Dragon race?</p><br/><p>\u2018But you are just but an insect at this moment. Let\u2019s see if you can remain calm after hearing this story.\u2019</p><br/><p>Galkima finished thinking and spoke with a leisurely expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems there was somebody with a very interesting memory out of the ones who had been running towards the portal. Do you know as well? That one of your underlings was creating a suppressive measure?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo frowned at these words.</p><br/><p>Suppressive measures.</p><br/><p>Of course he knew.</p><br/><p>But why did this come up right now.</p><br/><p>And he had already told Gwanje to demolish the plan before he had come here.</p><br/><p>Galkima made an amused expression as he looked at Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou see, I kind of found it first. Someone like you or me could probably survive even if this beast rolled. But I wonder how many of your race can survive.\u201d</p><br/><p>It had already been quite a while since he had sent away a Golden Akadus along with numerous other silver ones.</p><br/><p>He could make this giant beast roll whenever he wanted</p><br/><p>Using the Suppressive method the humans had prepared.</p><br/><p>\u2018If I knew that I\u2019d find something like this then there wasn\u2019t even a need to steal this guy\u2019s body. Keeping the promise would be a bit tedious.\u2019</p><br/><p>Well, he could just take all the Akarons up into the sky with the Akadus.</p><br/><p>Galkima\u2019s expression, which had been smiling proudly, turned extremely cold quickly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou insect. I shall salute you for pushing me this far into a corner. But this is far as you go. Surrender now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Actually with his current strength controlling everyone outside even without making the Gragos roll would be a piece of cake.</p><br/><p>Since the endlessly produced Akadus along with his powers was enough.</p><br/><p>But the man in front of him made him feel uneasy.</p><br/><p>If that guy had run away after feeling his strength then there would be nothing to fear.</p><br/><p>So he had let loose his aura on purpose.</p><br/><p>In order to test him.</p><br/><p>But he hadn\u2019t run away despite feeling the difference in strength, appeared in front of him and even continued to remain vigilant the whole time.</p><br/><p>\u2018So, you killed the Dragon race huh?\u2019</p><br/><p>Dragon race.</p><br/><p>A terrifying top tier ruling race of the Abyss whose name in itself struck fear into others.</p><br/><p>Though he was playing king in a place like this, if he were to get in the way of a Dragon race member then he would merely get used to wipe their toes.</p><br/><p>For him to kill such existences and to come back.</p><br/><p>If he didn\u2019t fear the Dragon race then what in the world did he fear?</p><br/><p>\u201cSurender. And cut off one of your arms and both your legs. Otherwise your entire race wouldn\u2019t be able to prevent getting destroyed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Actually him killing everyone wouldn\u2019t profit him in any way</p><br/><p>Since the ones he needed to control would get turned into corpses instead.</p><br/><p>But the man in front of him made him feel too uneasy.</p><br/><p>To the point where he had to threaten him.</p><br/><p>At that moment</p><br/><p>Pudududk</p><br/><p>A carrier pigeon flew towards Hansoo.</p><br/><p>A carrier pigeon from Gwanje.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis dumbass\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo frowned as he read the message.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>Gwanje, who had been crazily heading towards somewhere, made a depressed expression as he saw something on the way.</p><br/><p>People whom he had sent to destroy the Suppressive method.</p><br/><p>But their bodies had long turned cold from the ambush.</p><br/><p>Gwanje clenched his teeth and headed towards the location where the Suppressive method was after seeing the corpse of the man who had died right after sending in the message.</p><br/><p>And then cursed out after seeing the scene of the place.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damnit\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>He could see the Silver Akadus that were crazily pouring in the Graphites in the distance.</p><br/><p>And a blackened Akadus that was standing in front of them.</p><br/><p>The golden Akadus, no, Galkima who had been controlling the Akadus made a surprised face.</p><br/><p>Since he had never expected that somebody would come all the way here.</p><br/><p>But the golden Akadus realized who had come here and then laughed as it spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re quite brave aren\u2019t you. Aren\u2019t you the one who shook after getting hit once from before?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was making fun of him and laughing at him despite being a machine.</p><br/><p>Gwanje grinded his teeth at the words of the golden Akadus.</p><br/><p>\u2018Was there another one.\u2019</p><br/><p>There had been 10 in the battlefield.</p><br/><p>But originally there had been 12.</p><br/><p>It seems that it had succeeded in fixing one of the two broken ones.</p><br/><p>And that guy had come here after figuring this location out.</p><br/><p>The Akadus continued to speak as he looked at Gwanje.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did your underlings go, why did you come alone? I can still see the image of you struggling around and looking for your underlings.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Akadus was full of leisure.</p><br/><p>Since the one in front of him could not beat it no matter what it did.</p><br/><p>Gwanje replied expressionlessly at those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey have to guard the entrance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gwanje wanted to take all the forces he could and come here as well.</p><br/><p>But he could not.</p><br/><p>Since then he would get caught in the eye.</p><br/><p>He was barely able to escape the battlefield using his Margoth-level skills.</p><br/><p>But for a clan leader to take all his members and try to run away?</p><br/><p>No matter what excuse he would give, it wouldn\u2019t look like anything other than them escaping.</p><br/><p>Then the already nervous group of adventurers formations would break down in an instant and a huge chaos would be caused.</p><br/><p>Then it was obvious where the remaining Akadus would head into.</p><br/><p>\u2018Enbi Arin. I hope you lead them well.\u2019</p><br/><p>At this point the Golden Akadus\u2019 expression turned from ridicule to regret.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich means that you\u2019re alone. How are you going to do this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gwanje clenched his teeth and breathed in and out.</p><br/><p>If he couldn\u2019t block that guy here then they would all die.</p><br/><p>Due to the Suppressive method that he had prepared.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ahh\u2026I should not have prepared something like this.\u2019</p><br/><p>Gwanje was filled to the brim with regret.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t because everyone was going to die because of his mistake.</p><br/><p>Since he wasn\u2019t going to let such things happen.</p><br/><p>Gwanje, who had been pondering with a heavy expression, gulped down something that was in his hands.</p><br/><p>Gulp</p><br/><p>The moment he swallowed it.</p><br/><p>His blood in his entire body started to boil.</p><br/><p>The silver liquid inside the blood to be precise.</p><br/><p>A power level that was merely at the Margoth level started increase explosively.</p><br/><p>And then an irreversible change started to surround his entire body.</p><br/><p>Kururururu</p><br/><p>Gwanje made a sad and depressed expression as he saw his flaming body.</p><br/><p>\u2018Am I really going without even being able to see my daughter\u2019s face.\u2019</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t in the position to make Elkadion hold responsibility.</p><br/><p>Since the mistake he made was much bigger than the one she had made.</p><br/><p>And this was why he was going to take responsibility for it.</p><br/><p>Kiiiiiing</p><br/><p>The golden Akadus was shocked at Gwanje who had started to shine with silvery light.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou. Did you really?\u201d</p><br/><p>It knew that medicine well.</p><br/><p>Since it had seen the Akarons take it in order to deal with it.</p><br/><p>Berserk Emperor\u2019s Fluid.</p><br/><p>A secret measure of the Akadus that burned up one\u2019s life and allowed them to have the might of a crazy emperor for a short moment.</p><br/><p>Gwanje looked towards somewhere in the distance with a bitter expression.</p><br/><p>Dying wasn\u2019t that bad.</p><br/><p>Since he would\u2019ve died already at the hands of the Great Priest if it hadn\u2019t been for Hansoo.</p><br/><p>He was just extremely sad.</p><br/><p>That he wouldn\u2019t be able to see his wife\u2019s face anymore because of a single mistake he had made.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hansoo, I believe you can make this place truly peaceful.\u2019</p><br/><p>Then his wife and his daughter inside his wife\u2019s stomach would be able to live in happiness at least.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you are going out with me here you fucking bastard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gwanje, who had started to shine with a smokey silvery light, felt his heart burning up and muttered out.</p><br/><p>TL note : Is it his physical heart burning or his emotional heart? Or both\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

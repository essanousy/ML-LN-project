(3)</p><br/><p>The Hunter, Keron, looked at the brat in front of his eyes and was smirking at him but he was quite impressed with two things.</p><br/><p>The fact that he had gained information about the Hunter in this short amount of time despite landing in a whole new world.</p><br/><p>And the fact that he had decided to become a hunter with that information as the basis.</p><br/><p>Whether it was luck or his own skill, the decisions up to this point were quite amazing.</p><br/><p>Since living as a farmer here was not a very good way to live.</p><br/><p>\u2018But\u2026 You should think about the outcome as well.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hellum chuckled at Keron who was smiling evilly and explained the rules briefly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell. It\u2019s simple. You don\u2019t really have to win. You just need to show us that you are qualified to be a Hunter. Simple right?\u201d</p><br/><p>He just needed to show some skills.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, that side doesn\u2019t seem like he has any thoughts of losing anyway.\u2019</p><br/><p>As moment Hansoo poured strength into Forked Lightning in his hands while looking at Keron who was smashing the gauntlets against each other, everyone turned to look towards one direction.</p><br/><p>And Hellum, who was about to ready the fight, clicked his tongue.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk, Ekidu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Ekidu?\u2019</p><br/><p>When Altair was frowning at the unfamiliar new name.</p><br/><p>\u201cCease!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tatatatak</p><br/><p>A person jumped out from between the buildings, landed right in between Keron, Hellum and Hansoo as she shouted out loudly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Wow, what a beauty.\u2019</p><br/><p>While Altair was admiring her beauty.</p><br/><p>Ekidu, the woman who had jumped down, looked around at her surroundings and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, it seems someone on our side has made a mistake.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hellum slightly frowned and shouted out.</p><br/><p>\u201cEkidu, I didn\u2019t make a mistake. That guy asked for a promotion first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ekidu\u2019s beautiful expression turned into a slight frown at those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lie. How would a newbie know of such a \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>But Ekidu realized that it was the truth after seeing the expressions on Hellum, Hansoo and Altair.</p><br/><p>Hellum replied out confidently as he saw Ekidu getting flustered.</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you, I\u2019m not doing anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018They\u2019re going to leave soon anyway.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still a bit too much. Why is Keron going out? Keron\u2019s been here for over 11 months.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hellum couldn\u2019t reply as he didn\u2019t have anything to say to this either.</p><br/><p>Hansoo merely shook his head as he watched this scene.</p><br/><p>\u2018I can\u2019t watch this any longer.\u2019</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t have any time to bicker around here.</p><br/><p>\u2018It might be different if the time left for the offerings was more than 7 days but\u2026 If it\u2019s lower than that then just preparing for it is going to be hard enough.\u2019</p><br/><p>As Hansoo prepared himself.</p><br/><p>Kududududuk</p><br/><p>A tremendous aura exploded out from Hansoo\u2019s entire body.</p><br/><p>Kwarururu</p><br/><p>His body had puffed up the point where it was about to explode from the silver liquids inserted into his body from the Body Enhancement Surgery.</p><br/><p>The Dragon Essence Blade within his body reinforced his bones and the essence that was inside the blade stormed throughout his entire body.</p><br/><p>The Demonic Dragon\u2019s Reinforcement covered over the Thousand Soliders Armor as Pandemic Blade\u2019s spores started to slowly seep out from above that.</p><br/><p>Kuruuururnnng</p><br/><p>Silver, gold, black and yellow lights constantly swirled around Hansoo\u2019s body and the surrounding ground trembled as it blew apart.</p><br/><p>And Hellum made an expression of disbelief as he saw this.</p><br/><p>\u2018What the fuck\u2026No way. He\u2019s just a newcomer, how the hell.\u2019</p><br/><p>The reason why adventurers couldn\u2019t determine the other\u2019s strength with physical looks was very simple.</p><br/><p>Since the runes were a mystery of nature that the five senses could not sense.</p><br/><p>They would not be able to figure out how strong one was unless that person went full out.</p><br/><p>On the other hand it meant that if the user wanted others to see then they\u2019ll show it however much they wanted.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo\u2019s artifacts didn\u2019t look simple either.</p><br/><p>A shiny armor set and a spear that seemed like it could pierce through anything with just its aura.</p><br/><p>\u2018It seems his ring has something as well\u2026 It hasn\u2019t been long since he came up, he gained such items in the beginning areas of the Yellow zone?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hellum, who had been searching for an answer at the strange scene in front of him, suddenly reached a conclusion.</p><br/><p>\u2018Oh god, is everything on this kid\u2019s body a growing artifact? Unique ones as well?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hellum rubbed his eyes.</p><br/><p>Unique.</p><br/><p>Every skill and item had different values for their worth.</p><br/><p>They called the especially valuable skills and items due to them being very special.</p><br/><p>Some people said that if they found all of these uniques then they would be able to number them from 1 to 1000 according to their might but this was a story for another time.</p><br/><p>The one thing that was clear that the unique skills and artifacts had mights that were monstrous in comparison to those that could be gained from normal beasts.</p><br/><p>And their worths would be much more if they were growing artifacts as well.</p><br/><p>Hansoo, who had shrouded his entire body with light, spoke towards Keron.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck\u2026I feel like a beggar, damn.\u201d</p><br/><p>Keron raised the strength in his body to the brim from the sudden words of Hansoo and focused his senses.</p><br/><p>At the same time he put away his gauntlets and pulled out his precious weapon, .</p><br/><p>He thought it\u2019d be a walk in the park but for it to suddenly become a heavy duty job.</p><br/><p>No, no, the harshness of the job wasn\u2019t the important part.</p><br/><p>\u2018Wait, will I perhaps lose to this newbie?\u2019</p><br/><p>But Keron erased the anxiousness that was slowly crawling into his head.</p><br/><p>\u2018No way, no. It hasn\u2019t been long since he came here. Even if he has unique artifacts he shouldn\u2019t have been able to grow them that much.\u2019</p><br/><p>In conclusion, the unique artifacts would only grow properly if they ate yellow runes.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo and his artifact\u2019s growth should be around the bottom.</p><br/><p>His rune growth was almost 40%.</p><br/><p>With this much, even if Hansoo had reached 1% from 0, there was still a difference of heaven and earth between their strength.</p><br/><p>And the artifacts he had were special ones only supplied to the hunters of the village.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yeah, no need to be scared. God dammit, let\u2019s have a go at it.\u2019</p><br/><p>If he got pushed down here then there wouldn\u2019t be a greater humiliation then this.</p><br/><p>And Keron, who had finished his preparation, took a very slight glance at Ekidu.</p><br/><p>With a small hope of Ekidu stopping this fight.</p><br/><p>But Keron just spat out curses inwardly.</p><br/><p>Since the expression of Ekidu was bright and filled with joy.</p><br/><p>\u2018You damned bitch. Does me losing make you feel that good?\u2019</p><br/><p>But unlike Keron\u2019s thoughts, Ekidu wasn\u2019t feeling like this because of how Keron will get destroyed by Hansoo.</p><br/><p>No, her reason was much more different.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ve found him. Someone who is worthy of this village\u2019s leadership position\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>But she couldn\u2019t figure it out completely by just looking at him like this.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hurry and show me, please.\u2019</p><br/><p>Ekidu felt her beating heart as he looked at Hansoo with an expression full of expectation.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Keron! Hahahaha! I heard all about it! That you lost to a newbie!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahahahaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>As Minchul*, the team leader of the team that covered the 11th area, laughed the surrounding 11th area Hunters all laughed at Keron with him.</p><br/><p>They could only.</p><br/><p>To get beaten by a newbie.</p><br/><p>What kind of humiliation was this.</p><br/><p>It was such a funny story that Keron\u2019s defeat spread out throughout the entire village in an instant.</p><br/><p>\u201cKeron, hahahahaha! Was the newbie that strong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hellum, Ekidu and even the other newbies had all been quiet about what happened in the fight.</p><br/><p>Just the simple story of a newcomer being promoted to a Hunter had spread.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tsk. I\u2019m curious as to how he got destroyed but there\u2019s no way to figure it out since everyone who witnessed it is being quiet about it.\u2019</p><br/><p>Keron looked at Minchul making fun of him and then replied with a heavy expression.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026You try fighting him as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would we? Hahahaha! He\u2019s a Hunter like all of us now, so why? Heheheheh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd why the hell would we touch someone who\u2019s going to killed in a week? Hahahaha! We have no intentions of becoming like you!\u201d</p><br/><p>It might be different if that guy shook the entire village and was going to clash against them.</p><br/><p>Then it might\u2019ve be better to crush him right now.</p><br/><p>But that guy was going to be an offering with a 99.99% certainty.</p><br/><p>Why would they risk getting humiliated for no reason?</p><br/><p>The Keron over there will probably become the source of jokes after the new contracting period starts, in a month, and for about an entire year after that.</p><br/><p>\u2018He shouldn\u2019t apply for an extension. Not after this kind of humiliation.\u2019</p><br/><p>Once a Hunter became a 1st year in the yellow zone, they will be placed in front of another crossroad where they have to make a choice.</p><br/><p>Either get promoted.</p><br/><p>Or get kicked out.</p><br/><p>But most left.</p><br/><p>Since most people who were 1st years could go explore the , which led them to their next destination, and unlike being a Hunter the rank above it wasn\u2019t really that great.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, shall we stop making fun of him?\u2019</p><br/><p>Minchul slowly started to stop the sneering.</p><br/><p>Since the eyes of Keron shaking back and forth told them that provoking him further wasn\u2019t a good idea.</p><br/><p>The fact that he, who usually walked around cursing off everything around him, was standing quietly proved this.</p><br/><p>That he was just about to blow up.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tsk, he was quite proud of his power\u2026 He\u2019s probably quite pissed right now.\u2019</p><br/><p>Unlike them, who were in charge of the 11th area, Keron hunted in the 1st area.</p><br/><p>1st Area.</p><br/><p>The most dangerous area around the village and the place the strongest people were in charge of.</p><br/><p>Of course Keron was a powerhouse who was fitting to fight there.</p><br/><p>And as he lived in the 1st Area, his character turned more vicious and aggressive.</p><br/><p>Minchul decided to throw some final words and finish it off.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell. I heard that you at least got the reward. You can vent off your anger there then. You know, those girls who you like usually. Were they called Emily and Kachraki?\u201d</p><br/><p>Since he had completed the task given to him, he was still awarded.</p><br/><p>Keron looked at the two small medallions in his hands at Minchul\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Though they looked simple, these 2 medallions were created by skills so they couldn\u2019t be counterfeited.</p><br/><p>3 days of second level free pass against 2 farmers.</p><br/><p>Though originally it was 2 days but Hellum gave him 3 instead.</p><br/><p>And this made Keron even angrier.</p><br/><p>Since he knew the reason why Hellum gave him another.</p><br/><p>Kudududuk</p><br/><p>Keron clenched onto the medallion on his hands as if he wanted to break it.</p><br/><p>Emily and Kachraki.</p><br/><p>Two girls who he would\u2019ve ran off right away to if he gained the medallion.</p><br/><p>But the current him wasn\u2019t in a situation where he would do that.</p><br/><p>Since another sensation was driving away all his sexual desires out.</p><br/><p>Crunch</p><br/><p>Keron grinded his teeth, pocketed the medallions and then proceeded to walk towards where Ekidu lived which was halfway from the center of the village and where the Hunters lived.</p><br/><p>The office of the village leader.</p><br/><p>Before the sensation of a place with gravitas where they had to pay respect was quite strong but this feeling disappeared after Ekidus became the village leader.</p><br/><p>\u2018Muddle-headed bitch. She doesn\u2019t even have any desires over power. Is it because she\u2019s a girl or something?\u2019</p><br/><p>But she was still the village leader.</p><br/><p>She still had a large amount of authority.</p><br/><p>\u201cEkidu. I have something to say.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ekidu\u2019s residence was quite high up but her office was below it.</p><br/><p>Keron reached the office in an instant and spoke out very directly after smashing open the window.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat newcomer from before. Dispatch him to the 1st Area.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmmm\u2026Well you see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Keron got angrier as he looked at Ekidu who was making a perplexed expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you hesitating? You know the village\u2019s rules.\u201d</p><br/><p>The strong are assigned to dangerous places.</p><br/><p>And the weaker ones paid.</p><br/><p>This was the rule of the village.</p><br/><p>\u2018If nothing had gone wrong\u2026She probably wanted to dispatch him to some random place that isn\u2019t that dangerous.\u2019</p><br/><p>Ekidu probably wanted to let this bastard live happily for a week since he was an offering but he could not let that happen.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fuck, I didn\u2019t lose yet.\u2019</p><br/><p>This guy needed to be dispatched to the 1st Area no matter what.</p><br/><p>Keron grinded his teeth at the thought of the battle from before and asked Ekidus.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not saying that it can\u2019t happen right? Even if it\u2019s you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>But Ekidus shrugged her shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, even if you didn\u2019t say that\u2026 He said that he would go to the 1st Area with his own mouth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be with you starting tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Kururururururnnngg</p><br/><p>Hansoo stood above the wooden barricades on the outermost parts of the village and looked towards the especially dark 1st Area.</p><br/><p>1st Area.</p><br/><p>A place so dangerous that even the villagers carefully pried through the past 19 years.</p><br/><p>And a place that had been left as a mystery because of this.</p><br/><p>\u2018Just wait.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo glanced between the residence of the Hunters and the jungle of the 1st Area multiple times, left behind those words that seemed to be directed at someone and then jumped down from the barricades.</p><br/><p>TLN : *Minchul is probably the same one mentioned before in chapter 6. http://reincarnator.wikia.com/wiki/Minchul is the wikia page.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Crunch.</p><br/><p>As it finished devouring another person, the Ark-Roa\u2019s color and shape became more and more defined. </p><br/><p>Limbs sprouted out, and its body shrunk down in size.</p><br/><p>Though it was now smaller, it had become stronger overall and even its intelligence had risen.</p><br/><p>And slowly, the memories of the humans it had eaten started to appear inside its head.</p><br/><p>Well, it had the memories after consuming them actually.</p><br/><p>It just didn\u2019t have the intelligence to decipher the meanings behind them up until now.</p><br/><p>It had solely been focused on instinctively hunting and finding nutrition.</p><br/><p>But not anymore.</p><br/><p>There were about thirteen nutritious ones left.</p><br/><p>Ten of which were comrades of the two it had eaten.</p><br/><p>Two were enemies with the ten.</p><br/><p>One was feared by all.</p><br/><p>Kirrrik.</p><br/><p>Ark-Roa pondered with its newfound intellect.</p><br/><p>It was not a match for the being that everyone feared.</p><br/><p>But it wasn\u2019t hard to reach that level.</p><br/><p>It would just need to eat about four more to get to the next stage.</p><br/><p>Then everything would be over.</p><br/><p>It could then devour the world.</p><br/><p>Ark-Roa continued to think.</p><br/><p>It was time to choose.</p><br/><p>Either to eat the two who were separated from the others, and then head for the ten.</p><br/><p>Or head towards the ten.</p><br/><p>Of course, it didn\u2019t have to think very long.</p><br/><p>Its hunger had continued to call out to it.</p><br/><p>And it was even worse because it had absorbed the greed of the humans it had eaten.</p><br/><p>Greed for power.</p><br/><p>Greed to crush everything beneath its feet.</p><br/><p>Though it wasn\u2019t within the memories of the humans it had eaten, it had a feeling that it needed to get stronger as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>This newly enhanced greed and gluttony drove the Ark-Roa past the great tundra.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u2018F***...F***. F***. What do I do?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hermes was at a loss.</p><br/><p>He knew instinctively that the monster standing below the tower was a level above them.</p><br/><p>But then\u2014 </p><br/><p>A familiar voice could be heard behind him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastard, you just tried to run away, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hermes shrugged his shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fuss over it that much, you would\u2019ve done the same thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...Ugh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeus gave up.</p><br/><p>They were all like this.</p><br/><p>Since that man had deliberately picked people like this in the first place.</p><br/><p>\u2018What a shitshow.\u2019</p><br/><p>One after another, their allies started to gather.</p><br/><p>\u2014ssssss\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up? Why did you call us to meet up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF***\u2026Did you call us over to deal with him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018One\u2026Two.Three.\u2019</p><br/><p>Zeus frowned as he counted.</p><br/><p>Other than Hades, Hermes, and himself, there should be nine left.</p><br/><p>But only five had come.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Demeter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeus asked in confusion.</p><br/><p>He never knew what that b**** Athena was ever up to, and the other two were arrogant so it made sense that they wouldn\u2019t come.</p><br/><p>\u2018Athena is really hard to meet. I\u2019ve seen her maybe\u2026once? Twice?\u2019</p><br/><p>But this Hermes kid always followed Demeter around while wagging his tail.</p><br/><p>For someone whose territories were so close to not come together\u2026</p><br/><p>Hermes inwardly jolted at the question.</p><br/><p>\u2018Should I answer?\u2019</p><br/><p>But the answer came from someone else.</p><br/><p>Kyle, also known as Hades, raised his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe was eaten.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Don\u2019t joke around\u2026What could even eat us?\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the girls who had arrived after Zeus scoffed, but Zeus cursed out since he knew the identity of the Ark-Roa.</p><br/><p>\u201cF***\u2026it\u2019s that fast already. Why did you just leave if you knew she was being eaten? Why didn\u2019t you help?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Apparently, you haven\u2019t seen it yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hades replied with a heavy expression.</p><br/><p>They wouldn\u2019t really help each other if they were dying anyway.</p><br/><p>Even if their own children were being eaten, they wouldn\u2019t actually go and help them.</p><br/><p>Hades really didn\u2019t want to approach the creepy creature that devoured Demeter. Afterwards it had gone through some sort of metamorphosis, making strange noises all the while.</p><br/><p>The other trancendents noticed the strange tension between Zeus and Hades, and grew uneasy as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s up? What really happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did Demeter die?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everybody was making confused expressions.</p><br/><p>And Hermes realized the gist of the situation.</p><br/><p>\u2018That bastard\u2026 I know why he made us now.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hermes clenched his teeth.</p><br/><p>He realized why that man had made them and left them alone to roam freely.</p><br/><p>And why that man had reappeared the moment that black monster appeared.</p><br/><p>Why that powerful man was now just guarding the exit to go up.</p><br/><p>He realized it all.</p><br/><p>\u2018We\u2026we were raised as livestock\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>The only exit had been blocked and that horrifying monster now roamed this world.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>A thought appeared in Hermes\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey Zeus, you said you got caught by someone, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeus frowned. </p><br/><p>Hermes ignored Zeus\u2019s expression and continued to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said that he has a bad relationship with that man over there right? It looks like that man was the one who released the monster that ate Demeter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeus nodded.</p><br/><p>Hermes\u2019s guesses were mostly on point.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026how did you know that Demeter died?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hermes cut Zeus off as he continued to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not important. Anyway, that guy who caught you hasn\u2019t run away yet since he\u2019s confident, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hermes chuckled.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat else can we do? Let\u2019s go help him. That\u2019s the only path we can take at this point.\u201d</p><br/><p>Help the mysterious man who they had no information about.</p><br/><p>But, then again, their choices were very, very limited.</p><br/><p>At this rate they would only become food for that monster.</p><br/><p>But seeing that the guy had called them over, it looked like he had something up his sleeve.</p><br/><p>Which meant that right now, no matter what, they had to help that man who had captured Zeus.</p><br/><p>Whether to stab him in the back or run away without fighting him, that would only matter if they survived from this fight.</p><br/><p>There was nothing for them to gain from just loitering around here anyway.</p><br/><p>Zeus frowned at Hermes\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Dumbasses. You\u2019ll all probably be his slaves if you go to Hansoo\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t gathered them here to listen to Hansoo\u2019s instructions.</p><br/><p>But rather to ask for help.</p><br/><p>To suppress Hansoo, and just leave him at the point of death.</p><br/><p>Once they pressed him down with their weapons, they could just leave him with a breath of life remaining, and keep him in a safe place. And then he would be free.</p><br/><p>But it looked like that wouldn\u2019t work anymore.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>As Zeus frowned.</p><br/><p>A voice rang out.</p><br/><p>\u201cRetards. You go do that. I\u2019m betting my luck on something with higher chances.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? What are you planning to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hermes frowned at the curvaceous woman who had stepped out.</p><br/><p>The woman looked over her body, and then gulped.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s also a man\u2026something will happen, one way or another.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome on, Hera\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou f***er, call me by my name. Grow up, did I say I was going to be his wife?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hera\u2014real name, Allison\u2014cursed at Zeus.</p><br/><p>No matter what angle they looked at it from, the man who had created them held the absolute advantage.</p><br/><p>Shouldn\u2019t they stick to the winning side? At least she was going to.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yeah\u2026 If you\u2019re also a man, then\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>She was useful, strong and beautiful.</p><br/><p>Usually, she would pull out the eyes of anyone who had such thoughts towards her, but with their current situation, she had to utilize everything she had at her disposal.</p><br/><p>Allison quickly headed towards the man standing below the tower.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014 </p><br/><p>The Dark King violently trembled.</p><br/><p>When this man had attacked, he felt as if the world had collapsed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Was there this much difference\u2026?\u2019</p><br/><p>If he knew the differences were this large than he wouldn\u2019t have even tried to climb up.</p><br/><p>The Dark King trembled in fear as he stared at the man stepping on him.</p><br/><p>\u201cUghhh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The man raised his eyebrows.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy does this dumbass just keep screaming\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man put his hand on the Dark King\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014swoooosh!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The dark red aura started to get sucked out from the Dark King\u2019s brain and his heart.</p><br/><p>Into the hands of the man.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhh\u2026haa\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The Dark King even forgot the pain of his cut-off legs as he made a joyous expression.</p><br/><p>Since the pain of his severed leg was nothing compared to what Hansoo had given him.</p><br/><p>The man ignored the Dark King and focused solely on the dark red cloud in his hand, poking it with his finger.</p><br/><p>\u2014chiiiiik\u2014 </p><br/><p>The dark red aura tried to savagely burn his finger, but it couldn\u2019t withstand the aura surrounding the man\u2019s body and it soon dispersed into the air.</p><br/><p>And the man smirked.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Was he only this strong?\u2019</p><br/><p>The man sighed in relief.</p><br/><p>He had been uneasy the whole time he\u2019d planned this.</p><br/><p>He had vowed for revenge, but he didn\u2019t know how strong Hansoo had become in the past two years.</p><br/><p>This was why he had released the Ark-Roa, which even he was wary of.</p><br/><p>He felt like his own strength wouldn\u2019t be enough.</p><br/><p>But it looked like there was no need for him to release the Ark-Roa.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, let\u2019s go beat up Hansoo first\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>But the man soon shook his head.</p><br/><p>Since a girl had come to bother him.</p><br/><p>Unlike the other twelve, including the Dark King.</p><br/><p>The one who had escaped his watch as soon as she was made.</p><br/><p>\u2018If only everyone was this easy to read.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man smiled coldly as he looked at the woman who was approaching him with a charming smile of her own.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>800 kilometers west of the War Fortress.</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u201cHaa...Haa\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Taesang was gasping for air after having run for so long.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026F***. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m doing the right thing.\u2019</p><br/><p>He had been running like a crazed person to find that man\u2019s friends, who all apparently lived in the west.</p><br/><p>But he was scared out of his wits because of that Ark-Roa thing that was roaming the lands.</p><br/><p>\u2018No, it shouldn\u2019t be interested in weaklings like me. He said it wasn\u2019t interested in ants\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Though he was more of a dog than an ant.</p><br/><p>Of course, that wasn\u2019t really reassuring.</p><br/><p>The fact that he had some strength was the reason why he\u2019d been entrusted with this job anyway.</p><br/><p>Though he wasn\u2019t the main target of the Ark-Roa, he was able to pass through the tundra which the others would have a hard time crossing.</p><br/><p>\u2014boooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Kyaak!</p><br/><p>Taesang continued to run after turning four Kang-Kions into powder.</p><br/><p>Well, until something blocked his path.</p><br/><p>\u2014OOooong\u2014 </p><br/><p>The space in front of him had split apart.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are you going?

But his blades, which could chop apart abyssal monsters with ease, were caught by the woman\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>\u2018What the hell\u2026!?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014toong!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Taesang cursed, and backed off.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The woman figured out where Taesang was heading off to, and then smiled as if she realized something.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need to go?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt should be done by now.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

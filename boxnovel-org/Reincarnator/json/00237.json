He\u2019s probably bored. Or just curious.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo thought of the owner of the voice and mumbled.</p><br/><p>Gwanje.</p><br/><p>The person who was in charge of the Orange Zone with the Crown of Thorns and the artificial soldiers.</p><br/><p>And the one who was in charge over the body of Elkadion, the previous leader of the Akarons and the one who knew he came from the future.</p><br/><p>So Gwanje knew as well.</p><br/><p>That he came from the future.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well. One\u2019s okay.\u2019</p><br/><p>It might be different if he tried to use this information to influence others directly but one person knowing about it wouldn\u2019t make much difference.</p><br/><p>Hansoo rang the soul fragment and replied.</p><br/><p>Well it was just a matter of time, getting chased in a world like this where there are players everywhere was bound to happen.</p><br/><p>Though it happened a bit faster, he could still handle it.</p><br/><p>Gwanje sighed in relief from Hansoo\u2019s answer and then continued to speak.</p><br/><p>Of course these guys weren\u2019t entirely at fault.</p><br/><p>As the adventurers were just bug players in their eyes.</p><br/><p>But that didn\u2019t erase the fact that there were casualties.</p><br/><p>Gwanje mumbled in discontent as he thought of the ones who died and then asked Hansoo as if he suddenly got curious.</p><br/><p>A place where the game created by a God took root in.</p><br/><p>The reason for the creation of this game wasn\u2019t to please the people who would go through the Green Zone..</p><br/><p>Well, it was the opposite.</p><br/><p>If somebody told Gwanje that this game was created just to give pain to adventurers then he would easily believe it.</p><br/><p>Of course that was a bit too much but with the ability of the God, he could easily do this and from the way the fairies acted, a joke at this level would be normal.</p><br/><p>\u2018No. It doesn\u2019t seem like he contented himself with just making the game.\u2019</p><br/><p>Gwanje mumbled quietly.</p><br/><p>The creator probably did a few more things in order to kill off more adventurers.</p><br/><p>For example, make it so that players won\u2019t feel guilty about killing the adventurers or just make it so they could not see the adventurers as humans.</p><br/><p>Hansoo thought for a moment and then shook his head.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>The Abyss was actually very large.</p><br/><p>And there were still many places where Hansoo hadn\u2019t been to despite living in the Abyss for 50 years.</p><br/><p>Not meeting somebody in a place where tens of thousands of people from different races mingled together was quite normal.</p><br/><p>And he wasn\u2019t that interested either.</p><br/><p>Gwanje\u2019s curiosity didn\u2019t get resolved from Hansoo\u2019s half-hearted answer and complained.</p><br/><p>As Gwanje asked with a curious expression, Hansoo shook his head and answered.</p><br/><p>Gwanje groaned.</p><br/><p>Thinking about it, even if Hansoo came back from the future, he wasn\u2019t omnipotent.</p><br/><p>No, even if he could rule with strength over the entire battlefield, if he could do everything with power then he would be closer to a god than a savior.</p><br/><p>Gwanje suddenly stopped after thinking about a few things.</p><br/><p>He then asked Hansoo with a confused expression.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Rummmble.</p><br/><p>Rumble.</p><br/><p>Hurry! Hurry up!</p><br/><p>As Kamiyou ordered the adventurers up ahead, he swung his blade sideways.</p><br/><p>Cruunnchh!</p><br/><p>Crunch!</p><br/><p>\u201cWaaa! What the fuck! If you guys PK so brazenly then\u2026\u201d\u201cYou retard! What the hell are you saying? Can\u2019t you tell? Those bastards are bug players!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? How can there be so many bu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Crunch!</p><br/><p>Even before the man could finish his words.</p><br/><p>The players got split in two at the hands of the adventurers and then disappeared into golden light.</p><br/><p>They tried to resist but they couldn\u2019t deal with the adventurers whose strengths were far above their own on average.</p><br/><p>Even more so since they were the minority.</p><br/><p>The players, who created parties in groups of 30 to 50 people, had no way of beating the hundreds of people who were with Kamiyou and Christopher.</p><br/><p>But Kamiyou\u2019s expression was very gloomy.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fuck. I didn\u2019t want to smash through people like this\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Even if they were searching for their objective, there was no need to smash through the players.</p><br/><p>Though hundreds of people moving together might get them caught, 20 groups of 40 pretending to be player parties could easily get to their objective without too much resistance.</p><br/><p>It would take longer, but they would all get there safely and with few issues.</p><br/><p>But if they charged through like this, even though it would take much less time, the other players would flock to them like swarms of ants.</p><br/><p>But Kamiyou didn\u2019t really have much of a choice. </p><br/><p>Since he didn\u2019t have any leisure.</p><br/><p>Craack!</p><br/><p>A cold aura chased the adventurers from behind.</p><br/><p>While freezing the walls of the maze they ran through.</p><br/><p>Whoooosh!</p><br/><p>Kamiyou withdrew his foot from the chill that was trying to tie him down and then gritted his teeth as he looked behind him.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Fucking hell! \u2019</p><br/><p>The blaze-type S-level Spirit Stone, Scarlet Flower.</p><br/><p>And the freeze-type S-level Spirit Stone, Azure Land.</p><br/><p>From the darkness of the maze which Kamiyou was staring into.</p><br/><p>Kang! Kang!</p><br/><p>Sounds of two blue gauntlets clashing could be heard.</p><br/><p>Though he couldn\u2019t see the faces, he knew who was making these sounds at once.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Olsen.\u2019</p><br/><p>The infamy of the Scarlet Demons was widespread between the bug players.</p><br/><p>Since the bug players who got onto the blacklist had been ended by these guy\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>And the most famous of them were this duo.</p><br/><p>The captain who wielded the scarlet flower, Sharon Stiller.</p><br/><p>And the vice captain who controlled a wide field of blue ice, Olsen.</p><br/><p>Even amongst the Scarlet Demons who had received all the support they could, only these two had the S-level Spirit Stone.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t an issue of money, just that there weren\u2019t many of them in the first place.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fuck. This one\u2019s hard to deal with.\u2019</p><br/><p>Kamiyou felt a chill run down his back as he saw the blue waves that chased him from behind.</p><br/><p>Though it was weaker than the Scarlet Flower, the range was much larger.</p><br/><p>Since he could spread ice from places that he didn\u2019t even see.</p><br/><p>And at this moment, it was actually more threatening than the Scarlet Flower.</p><br/><p>The most annoying thing about the Azure Land was its effect of lowering movement speed.</p><br/><p>Though the adventurers were indeed superior to the players due to their control but their physical bodies or skills didn\u2019t have much difference with theirs.</p><br/><p>Which meant that there wasn\u2019t much of a difference in running speed between the players and them.</p><br/><p>If they got caught by that chill then they would get killed.</p><br/><p>By the hands of the Gold Demons behind Olsen.</p><br/><p>Kamiyou gulped.</p><br/><p>\u2018...There\u2019s still a lot of way to go!\u2019</p><br/><p>Oooooong!</p><br/><p>Kamiyou clenched his teeth as he touched the skull in his possession.</p><br/><p>The vibration of the skull was getting more and more intense.</p><br/><p>Which meant that the magic formation that resonated with the skull got closer.</p><br/><p>Soon he would arrive there.</p><br/><p>But Kamiyou sighed out in despair.</p><br/><p>\u2018...What could I do even after I get there?\u2019</p><br/><p>They needed to fight with the Gold and Scarlet Demons in front of them.</p><br/><p>And the rest of the players on the 4th floor would swarm to this location.</p><br/><p>Since the rumor would\u2019ve long spread.</p><br/><p>Kamiyou clenched his teeth as he thought up to this point.</p><br/><p>He had promised go to the seal with Hansoo.</p><br/><p>But at this rate, they would all get caught.</p><br/><p>\u2018And\u2026 We don\u2019t know what the hell will be at the Great Seal. How can we bring these guys in there?\u2019</p><br/><p>If there was something dangerous inside then they would get surrounded and all die.</p><br/><p>Kamiyou thought for a moment then smiled as he clenched the skull in his hand.</p><br/><p>\u2018I need to\u2026 Make a decision.\u2019</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>Kamiyou sent out a signal to all the people running with him.</p><br/><p>And Einchel was shocked out as she saw the signal.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Spread out and meet at the objective?\u2019</p><br/><p>For him to try to buy time.</p><br/><p>Einchel freaked out as she looked at Kamiyou.</p><br/><p>Then shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you trying to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kamiyou.</p><br/><p>The leader she had met in this place, the Ant Tunnel.</p><br/><p>They had only known each other for about 1 year.</p><br/><p>So she didn\u2019t know everything about Kamiyou but one thing was clear to her.</p><br/><p>That he could not block the ones chasing them by himself no matter what.</p><br/><p>Kamiyou clenched his teeth and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I heard something extra from the Prophet of the Ains in the past. Oh yeah. Take this.\u201d.</p><br/><p>\u201c...\u201d.</p><br/><p>Einchel clenched her teeth and nodded as she looked at Kamiyou who handed over a skull to her.</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on but...I can only trust him.\u2019</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t know about the prophecy of the Ains but nothing else mattered as long as Kamiyou wouldn\u2019t die a meaningless death.</p><br/><p>Einchel clenched the skull in his hand and then spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 Have to come back alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kamiyou smiled as he replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019ve survived in this damned world for 7 years already. That would be easy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kamiyou stopped his movements with those words and Einchel continued to run ahead with the skull.</p><br/><p>Towards their objective, the location of the Great Seal.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at these bastards.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even if he couldn\u2019t see it, his skills told him the movements of his enemy.</p><br/><p>Olsen smirked at the people scattering in front him him and then shouted out.</p><br/><p>\u201cSplit into four groups! Like how we practiced norm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Olsen stopped as he looked at the man standing in the middle of the frozen maze.</p><br/><p>A man missing a leg.</p><br/><p>One of the Gold Demon members smiled as he tried to swing his sword.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is min\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Gold Demon made a confused expression as he looked at Olsen who was blocking him.</p><br/><p>Since this had never happened before.</p><br/><p>Olsen smiled as he looked at Kamiyou in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are important to our Ant Eaters, we should treat you properly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kamiyou\u2019s expression froze up at Olsen\u2019s words.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Why is your face like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Olsen made a confused expression towards the Scarlet Demons who were charging at him with pissed off expressions.</p><br/><p>They had chased after Hansoo with confident expressions.</p><br/><p>Olsen was actually jealous of the 10 who had chased him.</p><br/><p>Since it was likely that those guys would get his artifacts once they killed him.</p><br/><p>But for their expressions to be that gloomy.</p><br/><p>\u2018What the hell happened within that short time...Was there a hole to escape through?\u2019</p><br/><p>If he had escaped through a path which they didn\u2019t know about then their expressions could be understood.</p><br/><p>As Olsen looked at the ten including Sharon Stiller with a strange expression.</p><br/><p>Sharon Stiller grinded her teeth and spoke out through them.</p><br/><p>\u201c...Stone of Immortality. How many do you guys have?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Stone of Immortality? Why do you need that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Stone of immortality.</p><br/><p>A peculiar artifact that allowed one to revive on spot without any penalties.</p><br/><p>Though no more than two could be used in a day, it was extremely practical to use so the demand for it was high, causing it to have a high price.</p><br/><p>But that was only for normal players.</p><br/><p>To the Scarlet Demons who had the direct support of the Ant Eater clan, the Stone of Immortality was part of the standard equipment.</p><br/><p>\u2018They should have one each\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Though they can use up to two a day and Olsen had received some before coming here, they didn\u2019t carry two at the time.</p><br/><p>Since there weren\u2019t many cases of them dying twice in a row.</p><br/><p>\u2018We need to have some backup measures. Wait. Wait a moment\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Olsen looked at Sharon Stiller with a dumbfounded expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe hell? You got killed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...\u201d</p><br/><p>Sharon Stiller\u2019s expression became incensed at Olsen\u2019s words which seemed like he was smirking at her.</p><br/><p>But Olsen wasn\u2019t joking.</p><br/><p>\u2018...She underestimated him?\u2019</p><br/><p>That was impossible.</p><br/><p>The reason why Sharon Stiller was the captain was not only because she had skills but because she had a good eye for people.</p><br/><p>Both for work and for personal affairs.</p><br/><p>She was good at estimating their opponent\u2019s power and distributed forces efficiently.</p><br/><p>Not everyone could become the captain of the hunting group of a large clan.</p><br/><p>There was no way that this Sharon Stiller failed to estimate someone\u2019s abilities.</p><br/><p>If Sharon Stiller had ten people go then it was because the ten of them were enough to deal with the opponent.</p><br/><p>Sharon Stiller gritted her teeth and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis bastard. He was hiding his skills.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Crunch.</p><br/><p>\u2018For them to all have Stones of Immortality.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo shrugged as he thought of the battle from just then.</p><br/><p>He wanted to remove them by waiting for the revive timer and killing them one more time but he held back and reunited with the adventurers here.</p><br/><p>They could at most use two a day.</p><br/><p>The remaining time he had to reunite with the ones who left for the location of the seal was a bit awkward and it would take too long for him to deal with them if they all had two Stones of Immortality each.</p><br/><p>\u2018I cannot forget about my objective.\u2019</p><br/><p>Whooosh.</p><br/><p>Hansoo held the Nurmaha\u2019s Ring and then looked towards the location of the seal with thousands of crosses.</p><br/><p>\u2018Things are going well.\u2019</p><br/><p>He had done well smashing apart those chasing him and had succeeded in reuniting with these guys.</p><br/><p>And there was another catch.</p><br/><p>He had been able to confirm the skills of the Scarlet Demons.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s not bad.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo smiled.</p><br/><p>In the Green Zone during his previous life, due to a certain incident there hadn\u2019t been many chances to deal with players so he had been able to safely grow his strength and climb up to the next Zone.</p><br/><p>So he wasn\u2019t quite sure before.</p><br/><p>How strong the master-tier players of the Green Zone were.</p><br/><p>Or how powerful the Spirit Stone was.</p><br/><p>But while fighting them, he realized he was mistaken about something.</p><br/><p>\u2018I see\u2026 Just the Spirit Stone is not enough to have such strength huh.\u2019</p><br/><p>When he had been living in the War Fortress in the past.</p><br/><p>He had seen a man who had a tremendous amount of strength.</p><br/><p>A power which he couldn\u2019t even imagine back then.</p><br/><p>He was sure that it was the strength of the Spirit Stone.</p><br/><p>This is why he had thought that everyone with S grade Spirit Stones had that much strength.</p><br/><p>He had hid his strength, judged that it was too dangerous to deal with those with S grade Spirit Stones and split them up.</p><br/><p>So he could kill them off one by one.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t underestimate them because of the man he had met in the past.</p><br/><p>But it seemed that wasn\u2019t the case.</p><br/><p>\u2018Jiang Oh.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo thought of the man\u2019s shouts, shook his head and then looked towards the crosses in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Anyways...This place is really impossible to find without the skull.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo swirled his tongue around while looking at the mana formation that filled the entire space within the crosses.</p><br/><p>Blurred vision, space distortion and mana disruption.</p><br/><p>With these many formations, it would be impossible to find this place even if it was in the middle of the War Fortress.</p><br/><p>Since even he had a hard time finding this place with the tracks.</p><br/><p>\u2018...That guy who caused the Sixth Great Change really is amazing huh.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo chuckled as he thought of the player who caused the 6th Great Change in the past.</p><br/><p>Even if he knew about it, for him to find this thing in the middle of nowhere.</p><br/><p>\u2018Sorry but...I\u2019m going to use it first.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked towards the crosses in front of him.</p><br/><p>Since he had found it, he just needed to finish things.</p><br/><p>The Great Seal.</p><br/><p>Remove the seal and drag out the Ains.</p><br/><p>Then the adventurers would also get the opportunity.</p><br/><p>The chance to use that tremendous strength.</p><br/><p>Hansoo finished his thoughts and beckoned Einchel with his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201c...\u201d</p><br/><p>Einchel, who was frowning, handed over the skull to him.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Whooosh.</p><br/><p>Black smoke came out from Hansoo\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Dark Cloud.</p><br/><p>The Dark Cloud came out from his body and seeped into the skull in his hand and the crosses next to him.</p><br/><p>The Dark Cloud tainted the skull and the crosses as it drained the information of the mana seal within.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo was shocked as he saw the information.</p><br/><p>\u2018...So complex.\u2019</p><br/><p>As if it was proving to have been set up by the forces of the kingdoms and empires, there were very complex formations within the skull and the crosses.</p><br/><p>Formations to suppress the entire maze, the space where the Ains lived.</p><br/><p>Hansoo pondered for a moment and then shrugged...</p><br/><p>\u2018Ugh\u2026 I can\u2019t handle it the traditional way.\u2019</p><br/><p>This is something that even the magic brigade will barely be able to solve in a week.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo, who didn\u2019t have much information in this field, couldn\u2019t solve it by himself.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t like he had a lot of time.</p><br/><p>And breaking it apart would be a bad choice.</p><br/><p>Since the entire maze might break down if the mana that was flowing here blew apart.</p><br/><p>The intricate system of mana that allowed a tremendous amount of strength could easily blow apart with a careless touch.</p><br/><p>So he needed to use the third method.</p><br/><p>Whooosh.</p><br/><p>Hansoo followed the flow of the mana and then headed toward one side.</p><br/><p>Toward a place where the complex mana formations all gathered to.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>\u2018Here.\u2019</p><br/><p>Crunch.</p><br/><p>Hansoo stood above an ordinary looking boulder of black granite after following the mana flow which resembled a spider\u2019s web.</p><br/><p>Einchel, Kamiyou and Christopher all made confused expressions while watching him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>It was a location looking completely ordinary compared to the thousands of crosses around them.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Cruunnchh.</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s foot dug into the granite below.</p><br/><p>Crraccck.</p><br/><p>The granite floor only seemed normal on the exterior but it was extremely hard.</p><br/><p>The granite floor broke apart like tofu under Hansoo\u2019s feet and started to show what was inside it.</p><br/><p>Crunch. Crack.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why is he digging the ground\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Clang.</p><br/><p>Sounds of chains clanking could be heard about a meter down.</p><br/><p>Hansoo smiled as he looked at the red chains in the ground.</p><br/><p>\u2018Found it. God\u2019s Flail..\u2019</p><br/><p>Well, the thing he found was just a single line of chain.</p><br/><p>A red chain that had the width of about four human fists.</p><br/><p>The tens of thousands of chains that originally existed couldn\u2019t be found anywhere as only a single one could be seen.</p><br/><p>Hansoo jumped into the ground and grabbed the chain.</p><br/><p>The rest of the chains were hidden deep within the ground.</p><br/><p>Tightly tied around the seal.</p><br/><p>These chains were the 3rd godly treasure of an Empire but something they had given up to seal the Ains.</p><br/><p>The Keil Kingdom gave up the space where a main mana node was located, the Korin and other Kingdoms poured in 66666 people as sacrifices for this seal.</p><br/><p>This is how this seal was created.</p><br/><p>By using the tremendous mana of the mana node, the despair and curse of the 66666 people and the Empire\u2019s godly treasure, God\u2019s Flail..</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t get rid of a mana node.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t get rid of the curse laid down upon the entire maze either.</p><br/><p>But the seal was created with these three things working together.</p><br/><p>And getting rid of one was enough.</p><br/><p>Ting. Tingtingting.</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s body started to change as he pulled the chain apart a few times.</p><br/><p>Rooaaarrrr.</p><br/><p>His muscles swelled multiple times over and scales covered his entire body.</p><br/><p>Two extra hearts grew next to the original one.</p><br/><p>Hansoo felt the tremendous amount of power running through his body and then pulled apart the chain again.</p><br/><p>Craacck!</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>A bit more of the chain got pulled out from the ground.</p><br/><p>About Hansoo\u2019s height.</p><br/><p>At the same time.</p><br/><p>Rrrumblee.</p><br/><p>The thousands of crosses made rumbling noises as the entire area shook.</p><br/><p>As the seal broke apart, the mana and the curse loosened up and in turn, the crosses started to cry out.</p><br/><p>Hansoo frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201c...\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018This is going to take forever.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo shouted behind him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHelp me a bit.\u201d\u201c...\u201d</p><br/><p>A few other people who had been staring at Hansoo around him ran to him and started to pull at the chain.</p><br/><p>Clang.</p><br/><p>Christopher, who stood behind Hansoo, asked carefully.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo we...Just need to pull this out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust pull this out.\u201d\u201c...\u201d</p><br/><p>It felt like the entire bloodthirsty aura of the maze was flowing into them.</p><br/><p>And Christopher realized what Hansoo meant as he poured more strength into his arms.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>Booom!</p><br/><p>The intense lightning strike from the A level Spirit Stone, , smashed the ground in front of the member of the Scarlet Demons, Kangmin.</p><br/><p>Chiiiiik!</p><br/><p>The infected soldiers of the 1st floor couldn\u2019t even resist as they melted down.</p><br/><p>Kangmin frowned at the tremendous amount of infected soldiers who continued to charge at him despite so many of them having already been killed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fuck. This is annoying. We should\u2019ve just done this on the way if it was on the first floor, why did we ignore it?\u2019</p><br/><p>Well, since he had received payment he had to do his job.</p><br/><p>Boom! Boooom!</p><br/><p>Kangmin swung his weapon, headed towards the Jewel of the Dead and chuckled while thinking of Sharon Stiller.</p><br/><p>They wouldn\u2019t fail.</p><br/><p>Even if the bug players were very strong.</p><br/><p>They had another method other than the Scarlet and Gold Demon\u2019s strengths.</p><br/><p>\u2018I just need to focus on my work. With this...The Seal will get strengthened?\u2019</p><br/><p>The deal they had made with Arthus Krancheska on the way in here.</p><br/><p>Kangmin mumbled as he looked at the blue pouch he received from Sharon Stiller.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

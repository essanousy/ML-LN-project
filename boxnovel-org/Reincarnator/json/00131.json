Fight!\u201d</p><br/><p>Oteon shouted out loudly and squeezed out the remaining power of the forbidden technique as they charged towards the Akadus.</p><br/><p>Crack!</p><br/><p>It hadn\u2019t even been an hour since they started to fight with the Akadus who were protecting the Factory.</p><br/><p>Though they had been able to get near the factory, almost half of the Akarons had died off.</p><br/><p>And the living ones weren\u2019t in that good of a shape either.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuuuu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>Akarons who had been turned into a mess were making painful expressions and were rolling around the ground.</p><br/><p>The moment the forbidden technique got released, a tremendous amount of pain rushed over them.</p><br/><p>But even during this suffering, the eyes of the Akarons were fixated on the Crown of Thorns in the distance.</p><br/><p>Taruhol suppressed the pain that was jumping around within his body.</p><br/><p>\u2018The side effects will die down eventually.\u2019</p><br/><p>The important thing was activating that crown and stopping the Akadus.</p><br/><p>Taruhol smashed his fist onto the chest of the Akadus.</p><br/><p>Booooom!</p><br/><p>The Akadus, which still moved despite receiving damage to its head, stopped working as the core got smashed apart.</p><br/><p>Kiiiiing</p><br/><p>Taruhol clenched his teeth in order to suppress the pain and then shouted towards Hansoo who had been fighting next to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI need to wear that crown?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. The Akaron with the strongest physique must take it on!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Crown of Thorns wasn\u2019t something created for humans.</p><br/><p>When he sees Taruhol acquiring the Crown of Thorns and see him using it properly, he will implant a soul fragment onto him.</p><br/><p>And then create an alliance between humans and the Akarons.</p><br/><p>Since the humans wouldn\u2019t be able to easily do much to the Akarons if they have the Akadus along with the Crown of Thorns to control them with.</p><br/><p>\u2018And I\u2026Will obtain Mekido\u2019s holy weapon, Dragon Essence Blade.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was written in the memory crystal that the Dragon Essence Blade would come out when they acquired the Crown of Thorns.</p><br/><p>As Taruhol heard Hansoo\u2019s words, he made stomping noises as he crazily headed towards the Soul Telautograph.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuard him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHelp the first pillar so he can arrive there intact!\u201d</p><br/><p>The numerous Akarons who had been crying out in agony pulled out the remaining bits of their strengths and slowed down the Akadus.</p><br/><p>And Taruhol ran even more urgently after seeing this.</p><br/><p>The amount of casualties will rise tremendously at this rate.</p><br/><p>He would need to acquire the Crown of Thorns as quick as possible before casualties rose too much.</p><br/><p>Booooom!</p><br/><p>While they were constantly moving up.</p><br/><p>Hansoo suddenly stopped fighting and backed off.</p><br/><p>Oteon, who had been fighting near the tunnel along with hundreds of other Akarons, shouted towards Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are you going!\u201d</p><br/><p>The formation would break down and the casualties would rise even more if Hansoo left.</p><br/><p>Hansoo shouted towards Oteon.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait for me. There\u2019s something I need to deal with.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo then felt the humans, who had gotten quite close, as he rushed towards them.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go in quickly! We don\u2019t know what they would do!\u201d</p><br/><p>Rong Wian found the remnants of those guys, befitting of his position and role, as he shouted.</p><br/><p>A tunnel which did not look simple even from a single glance.</p><br/><p>And the traces of Akarons existed all throughout the tunnel.</p><br/><p>Rong Wian felt urgent after realizing that it had been quite a while since they went in.</p><br/><p>\u2018It would be a disaster if they escape through the portal!\u2019</p><br/><p>The people who had escaped along with Rong Wian started to run madly.</p><br/><p>And they looked at the surrounding tunnel as they ran.</p><br/><p>A strange tunnel that was artificial even from a simple glance.</p><br/><p>And a small amount of excitement started to fill up the minds of the adventurers.</p><br/><p>It seemed like a relic site of the Akarons, another reward might be prepared in a place like this.</p><br/><p>But their expressions turned grim after a bit of running.</p><br/><p>Powerful shockwaves and sounds of clashes came through the tunnel and rushed over their head.</p><br/><p>Despite them being quite a distance away from the battlefield.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t know what was inside but this told them that it was dangerous.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Do we have to continue?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do Rong Wian. It doesn\u2019t seem easy over there either, are we going back?\u201d</p><br/><p>Rong Wian pondered for a moment at the words of Matel, another captain of the scout team who had the same idea as him.</p><br/><p>It would be dangerous if they continued.</p><br/><p>But then both the battlefield they came from and the one they were heading to were dangerous.</p><br/><p>\u2018Shall I have a look.\u2019</p><br/><p>Rong Wian, after checking the battle with his skill , laid down a decision.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just wait here, we don\u2019t need to fall in danger by going in. And it seems like they would win anyway.\u201d</p><br/><p>If one side lost then they would all die.</p><br/><p>They would return if that was the case but there wasn\u2019t really a need for them to if they weren\u2019t going to lose.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019ll be better if there\u2019s more casualties.\u2019</p><br/><p>Rong Wian laughed.</p><br/><p>An escapee\u2019s sins were hard to forgive no matter when.</p><br/><p>It would be hard for them to dodge the aggression they would receive after the battle ending.</p><br/><p>Which meant that the more casualties both sides had, the better it would be for them.</p><br/><p>At that moment a strange existence came into his view.</p><br/><p>A bright golden light.</p><br/><p>\u2018What is it?\u2019</p><br/><p>Rong Wian freaked out as he looked at the person who had arrived before him.</p><br/><p>An entirely golden existence that was closer to a dragon than a human.</p><br/><p>\u2018This guy\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>It was the guy who had risen to fame recently in just a few days.</p><br/><p>Rong Wian breathed in and out deeply and then turned around.</p><br/><p>The one who always had the upper hand was not the desperate side but the leisurely side.</p><br/><p>And they, the ones resting and charging up their power, had much more leisure than the ones who were fighting.</p><br/><p>\u2018That side is urgent too, he shouldn\u2019t be trying to make us into enemies at this point.\u2019</p><br/><p>His mind was set ease as he looked at the hundreds of adventurers who had been gathered here.</p><br/><p>Rong Wian shrugged his shoulders as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems you\u2019re busy, why did you come here?\u201d</p><br/><p>That idea was solidified even more as he saw Hansoo who was covered in blood from head to toe.</p><br/><p>His voice sounded tired and that location seemed way too vicious to follow this guy\u2019s word and fight.</p><br/><p>Hansoo just spat out a short sentence.</p><br/><p>\u201cChoose quickly, as to what you will do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSadly for you\u2026 You only have two choices. Come with me, or remain here.\u201d</p><br/><p>One person smirked as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you a bit too cold? We can just fight the silver Tiradus if we go back right? We aren\u2019t that unfriendly you know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys lost that chance already.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo spoke out coldy.</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t brought the Akarons here.</p><br/><p>The Akarons had risked their lives and came here of their own accord.</p><br/><p>To this place which was much more vicious that the silver battlefield back there.</p><br/><p>It was too late for these guys to go back.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying\u2026 I guess we\u2019ll just stay here then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rong Wian felt uneasy from the threatening words but he made a smile as he denied the offer.</p><br/><p>Hansoo heard these words as he looked around.</p><br/><p>It seemed like everyone agreed.</p><br/><p>No, they had escaped the silver battlefield since they agreed with this guy anyway.</p><br/><p>Why wouldn\u2019t the others escape, they had the ability to as well.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is the end for you then.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo quietly mumbled as he poured his power into his spear.</p><br/><p>Rong Wian raised his weapons with a nervous expression from that.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to have a go at it?\u201d</p><br/><p>That moment.</p><br/><p>Hansoo used a tremendous amount of strength and swung the spear.</p><br/><p>Booooooooooom!</p><br/><p>Rong Wian freaked out but he laughed as he looked behind him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bit of a coward huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo hadn\u2019t thrown the spear at them.</p><br/><p>Actually he had thrown it towards where he had come out from.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust say you\u2019re scared if you are\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>A tremendously large sound was heard from the battlefield in the distance where Hansoo had thrown the spear to.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cGoddamit\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Boooooom!</p><br/><p>Taruhol grinded his teeth and smashed the wall in front of him after getting to the Soul Telautograph.</p><br/><p>An extremely powerful energy barrier was surrounding the Soul Telautograph.</p><br/><p>But Taruhol didn\u2019t give up as he continued to smash it.</p><br/><p>Since it wasn\u2019t impregnable despite its strength.</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>Taruhol was surprised as he looked up.</p><br/><p>Kiiiiiiing</p><br/><p>The moment he smashed the wall with his energy, the ceiling located right beneath the holy land made strange noises as it opened up.</p><br/><p>Along with a sound of something activating.</p><br/><p>Kiiiingg</p><br/><p>Taruhol unconsciously cursed out loud after seeing this.</p><br/><p>\u201cGod fucking dammit\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know what was coming down within the energy barrier and the white steam.</p><br/><p>But he knew just from its aura.</p><br/><p>The thing that was coming down was extremely dangerous.</p><br/><p>It wouldn\u2019t be much of a problem if they fought it but they would get massacred since they were being pushed back by the Akadus already.</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>A single line of lightning smashed into the thing that was descending from the sky.</p><br/><p>Booooooom!</p><br/><p>\u201cUhhk?\u201d</p><br/><p>Taruhol looked towards where the lightning had come from.</p><br/><p>It hadn\u2019t come from within the Akarons but from the tunnels that they came in from.</p><br/><p>The spear which flew in through the tunnel cut through the skies and smashed into the thing within the steam.</p><br/><p>Kiruk?</p><br/><p>At the same time 12 golden beams exploded out from the steam.</p><br/><p>Towards where the spear came from.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Kiiiiiiiing!</p><br/><p>A sound of something approaching them at a tremendous speed could be heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell have you just\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As Rong Wian made a nervous expression at the thing approaching them, Hansoo laughed quietly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to do your part then I will make you do it forcibly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Rong Wian was about to reply to those words.</p><br/><p>Kwaaajijijik!</p><br/><p>Something flew in from the tunnels as it turned six people into minced meat.</p><br/><p>The people who had been charging towards it freaked out as they stopped in place.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat! Fucking hell! What the hell is this!\u201d</p><br/><p>The bright golden existence which had flown from across the tunnel started to turn everyone into minced meat.</p><br/><p>Kwajijik</p><br/><p>Kwajik</p><br/><p>\u201cUaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAahhhhh!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was so fast that they couldn\u2019t even see it.</p><br/><p>But as their eyes got used to it, they could see what it was.</p><br/><p>A similar look as the one of the silver Tiradus from the outside.</p><br/><p>But its color and size was different.</p><br/><p>12 golden Akadus that towered 5m tall.</p><br/><p>Ooooonggg</p><br/><p>\u201cGod fucking damnit!\u201d</p><br/><p>The adventurers started to madly attack the Akadus flying towards them but it was useless.</p><br/><p>They were getting hunted down one by one.</p><br/><p>Rong Wian shouted out in fury from this scene.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou crazy bastard! Why did you bring this thing here? Are you still human! Everyone here is going to die because of you!\u201d</p><br/><p>If he had left it then it would\u2019ve attacked the Akarons.</p><br/><p>But he had purposely brought it here.</p><br/><p>In order to make them fight it instead.</p><br/><p>Hansoo coldy mumbled.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a better choice than a failure.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo thought of the past.</p><br/><p>They had thought of a lot of things and voiced their opinions to each other.</p><br/><p>Eres, Kangtae, Keldian and his opinions were all different.</p><br/><p>Eres always wanted to save people as long as they weren\u2019t completely insane.</p><br/><p>Since humans could change.</p><br/><p>Keldian wanted to kill everyone who even had a possibility of coming in his way.</p><br/><p>Quite similar to how Eres thought, since Keldian also thought that humans could change at any moment.</p><br/><p>Kangtae would cut off their necks if they got in his way but would usually leave them be and not care about them.</p><br/><p>Hansoo was in between Keldian and Kangtae but respected Eres\u2019 opinion since his goal was saving the human race.</p><br/><p>And he was also seeing the positive sides of the humans.</p><br/><p>Hansoo thought of the report of the young Tekilon, who was ruling over the Red Zone.</p><br/><p>But this was really the limit.</p><br/><p>\u2018Eres, it seems like you were a bit wrong. This place\u2026 doesn\u2019t have that much leisure.\u2019</p><br/><p>What if they were to fail because of this? All of them might die just because he tried to save a thousand lives.</p><br/><p>No, for success he was willing to sacrifice tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of people.</p><br/><p>His thoughts, which were usually in line with with Eres\u2019 ideals, jumped across Kangtae and reached Keldian\u2019s level.</p><br/><p>\u2018Change the benchmark. The ones who would go up and fight along with us in the Abyss\u2026 Will only be those who deserve to live.\u2019</p><br/><p>If these guys had fought with him then they would\u2019ve been able to decrease the amount of casualties and acquire the Crown of Thorns together.</p><br/><p>But since these guys refused, this was the only option to acquire the Crown of thorns.</p><br/><p>By distracting the final guardian of the Crown of Thorns, the 12 golden guards.</p><br/><p>\u201cUaaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo heard the screams that were ringing from all around him as he threw them away as bait and discreetly flew back towards the Crown of Thorns.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201cDamnit! It became even harder because of those bastards!\u201d</p><br/><p>Gwanje clenched onto his teeth as he looked at the Akadus that were charging from all directions.</p><br/><p>They emptiness of those who had ran away could not feel any heavier than this.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damnit\u2026 I want to run away too.\u2019</p><br/><p>He wanted to get away from this damned place along with his wife.</p><br/><p>Most humans would die from the silver Akadus but people at his level would survive.</p><br/><p>No, most of the Margoth levels were probably thinking this.</p><br/><p>If they are able to escape her and hide then they would be able to find the portal by eating the corpses of the dead humans.</p><br/><p>They could definitely survive with their power levels.</p><br/><p>But what about after that?</p><br/><p>Gwanje thought of his wife.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fuck\u2026I cannot let my wife live such a life.\u2019</p><br/><p>Living like a scumbag was enough for himself.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hansoo you fucking bastard. Hurry the hell up.\u2019</p><br/><p>That guy would only survive if he and the others held on here.</p><br/><p>Gwanje thought of the bigger picture that Hansoo was drawing as he clenched his teeth and smashed the Akadus that was charging towards him.</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>Kidududududu</p><br/><p>A sudden sound rang throughout the battlefield as all of the Akadus suddenly stopped moving.</p><br/><p>\u2018They succeeded\u2026!!\u2019</p><br/><p>Gwanje made a joyful expression as he crumpled onto the ground in a sitting position.</p><br/><p>\u201cHoooh\u2026God damn. That was hard as hell.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gwanje muttered as he looked at the silver Akadus that had fallen in front of him.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

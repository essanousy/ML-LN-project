We would have come here right away.\u2019</p><br/><p>R-Koronaita Nell frowned.</p><br/><p>Because they had been led astray by some useless place, they had lost nine suits of Dragon God Armor.</p><br/><p>At this point, he was now thinking that Aokan had been a trap.</p><br/><p>A trap to lead his focus somewhere else while the enemy accomplished their original goals.</p><br/><p>Of course, if that insect race had successfully warped to Angkara, it would have been a catastrophe.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t regret his decision to go to Aokan because of this, but the end result was still an issue.</p><br/><p>They had lost nine Dragon God Soldiers.</p><br/><p>And those nine Dragon God Soldiers hadn\u2019t even stopped the Quantum Transmission either.</p><br/><p>The two aliens had done it all.</p><br/><p>Losing nine Dragon God Soldiers was something that would cause a bit of trouble even to him.</p><br/><p>He was sure that this incident would cause a few of the families to charge at him and chew him apart.</p><br/><p>They would say that an incompetent fleet master like him should receive retribution.</p><br/><p>\u2018And try to fill up their own stomachs in one go.\u2019</p><br/><p>R-Koronaita Nell frowned.</p><br/><p>He could not let that happen.</p><br/><p>\u2018I need to deal with N-Aroel first.\u2019</p><br/><p>If someone who had witnessed everything with his own eyes were to tell the truth, then his situation would become much worse.</p><br/><p>If he could push the story that he\u2019d sacrificed the Dragon God Soldiers to stop the Quantum Transmission and twist some facts, he could deal with the flames for now.</p><br/><p>\u2018Killing him would be too eye-catching\u2026 I\u2019ll just have to handle his words.\u2019</p><br/><p>If he knew that this would happen, then he would have dealt with N-Aroel the moment he came up here, but it was too late.</p><br/><p>If somebody who had safely returned were to suddenly die, then the hyenas would jump on him for that as well.</p><br/><p>R-Koronaita Nell spoke to his lieutenant commander.</p><br/><p>\u201cCall N-Aroel to the captain\u2019s room.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood. But what of the situation below?\u201d</p><br/><p>R-Koronaita Nell frowned at these words.</p><br/><p>\u2018Mmm\u2026 What to do?\u2019</p><br/><p>He wanted to throw everything they had at that structure.</p><br/><p>Those bombs didn\u2019t make him feel at ease at all.</p><br/><p>He wanted to sweep the three locations with a huge burst of firepower.</p><br/><p>But his instincts, hardened by decades of experience, made it clear.</p><br/><p>That it wouldn\u2019t be that simple.</p><br/><p>A strange incident on top of a strange creature.</p><br/><p>\u2018Wait\u2026 I can just handle this together.\u2019</p><br/><p>According to what he\u2019d heard, N-Aroel was an amazing scientist.</p><br/><p>He would know some things about the situation below since he had survived there for quite a long time as well.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know how much N-Aroel knew, but it would be of great help if he could pry that information out from him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll decide after I speak to N-Aroel. Continue watching over Nelkipa until then and if a situation that could threaten the fleet arises\u2026 attack without holding back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018I should hurry.\u2019</p><br/><p>The situation really was dire.</p><br/><p>R-Koronaita Nell quickly walked towards the captain\u2019s room as he thought to himself.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou called for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Sit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Look at him.\u2019</p><br/><p>R-Koronaita Nell looked at N-Aroel and frowned. The man had on a calm expression.</p><br/><p>He continued to stare at N-Aroel with a frown and then shook his head as he said:</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get to the main point. Do you know anything about the situation below?\u201d</p><br/><p>R-Koronaita Nell asked with a hardened expression.</p><br/><p>He really didn\u2019t like N-Aroel\u2019s attitude.</p><br/><p>An N-level shouldn\u2019t be this calm in front of an R-level.</p><br/><p>They should be wary and careful of every action and every word.</p><br/><p>Since the R-levels had the strength to change their entire lives.</p><br/><p>That was the difference between their ranks.</p><br/><p>Even more so to an apex R-level like him.</p><br/><p>\u2018If his responses aren\u2019t satisfactory\u2026 I\u2019ll just clean him up.\u2019</p><br/><p>N-Aroel wouldn\u2019t like that, of course.</p><br/><p>Unlike before, his current mood wasn\u2019t quite the best.</p><br/><p>He was actually looking forward to seeing N-Aroel stutter out his words.</p><br/><p>He could handle him with much more ease if that happened.</p><br/><p>But unlike R-Koronaita Nell\u2019s expectations, N-Aroel spoke with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. I know very well about the matters below.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...You know well?\u201d</p><br/><p>R-Koronaita Nell frowned.</p><br/><p>An unexpected answer had come out.</p><br/><p>\u2018He knows well?\u2019</p><br/><p>On his way over here, R-Koronaita Nell had lowered his expectations towards N-Aroel\u2019s answers.</p><br/><p>Because\u2026 he wouldn\u2019t have been reduced to such a state if he\u2019d known a lot.</p><br/><p>Melchizedek had ambushed them to drive out the forces of Angkara and then focused on his objectives from that point on.</p><br/><p>If N-Aroel and others knew a lot about Nelkipa and Melchizedek, then they wouldn\u2019t have been pushed back this badly.</p><br/><p>But how could N-Aroel, who\u2019d hidden around Aokan like a rat, know anything?</p><br/><p>\u2018That\u2019s what I thought at least, but\u2026 he knows a few things, huh?\u2019</p><br/><p>R-Koronaita Nell was shocked but soon spoke with a serious tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeak. What\u2019s going on below? What is that high energy reaction?\u201d</p><br/><p>N-Aroel laughed as he said:</p><br/><p>\u201cSimple. Those three locations are the core locations to control Nelkipa, and by the looks of things\u2026 someone is trying to make them self-destruct.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Self-destruct?\u201d</p><br/><p>R-Koronaita Nell made a confused expression.</p><br/><p>Why were they trying it blow it up?</p><br/><p>\u2018Melchizedek\u2026 Didn\u2019t he want to take over Nelkipa?\u2019</p><br/><p>At R-Koronaita Nell\u2019s words, N-Aroel suddenly looked as if he remembered something.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. Sorry about that, there was a misunderstanding. The ones trying to cause the self-destruction is not Melchizedek, but the aliens. Melchizedek is using the crystal for a different reason.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe aliens?\u201d</p><br/><p>N-Aroel nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. Those aliens\u2026 don\u2019t really like each other. One side hates another, and another side hates them both. This is why they\u2019re trying to destroy Nelkipa, so they won\u2019t even have a place to come to anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...Dumb creatures. Truly barbarians.\u201d</p><br/><p>R-Koronaita Nell was at a loss.</p><br/><p>For them to go to such lengths to destroy each other.</p><br/><p>They were apes.</p><br/><p>At that moment\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014N-Aroel suddenly broke into laughter.</p><br/><p>And R-Koronaita Nell was enraged at this sight.</p><br/><p>\u2018This filthy\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>For an N-level to act like this in front of him.</p><br/><p>There was nobody who had acted like this in the past.</p><br/><p>But of course, R-Koronaita Nell couldn\u2019t decide what to do with N-Aroel.</p><br/><p>He\u2019d never dealt with a situation like this before, so he didn\u2019t know how to handle it.</p><br/><p>He wanted to call the guards and torture N-Aroel, but he didn\u2019t live his life like that.</p><br/><p>He always thought through his actions, calculated how his actions would change things, and did not act on his emotions.</p><br/><p>R-Koronaita Nell decided to take a step back and spoke to N-Aroel.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t do anything, but he didn\u2019t hide his contempt.</p><br/><p>N-Aroel shook his hands and said:</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026 I apologize. I just found it funny that you called the aliens barbarians because of their actions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor the fleet captain of the war planet, Angkara, to say something like that. Isn\u2019t it funny for someone who\u2019s lived his entire life killing his own kind to call something like this an act of barbarians?\u201d</p><br/><p>R-Koronaita Nell\u2019s expression turned gruesome.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Is this guy crazy?\u2019</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t even angry anymore, but just simply at a loss for words.</p><br/><p>What did he have backing him up for him to act so confidently?</p><br/><p>He had heard that some people lost their sense of fear after spending a long time stranded by themselves.</p><br/><p>R-Koronaita Nell looked at N-Aroel with a strange expression and then spoke with a severe tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cWatch your words. I am holding back a great deal right now, and you\u2019ve done more than cross the line..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight\u2026 Understood. If I hurt you with my words, then I apologize. Anyway, where was I\u2026 Ah! The crystal, right? Two of the reactions below will cause the crystals to self-destruct, and the other is Melchizedek\u2019s. They\u2019re using them for different purposes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...\u201d</p><br/><p>R-Koronaita Nell decided to hold back on what to do with N-Aroel and refocused on his original objective.</p><br/><p>To understand the situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, what is Melchizedek planning?\u201d</p><br/><p>N-Aroel had said so just now.</p><br/><p>That Melchizedek had a different goal from the aliens.</p><br/><p>And in his opinion, that was the most important point at this moment.</p><br/><p>N-Aroel chuckled.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. That\u2019s the most important part.\u201d</p><br/><p>N-Aroel breathed in and out and then asked R-Koronaita Nell.</p><br/><p>\u201cCaptain. The Nelkipa over there. Do you know who created it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u201cPhew.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ve entered at last.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014chiiiiiik\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo looked around as he cooled down his heated body.</p><br/><p>He\u2019d had to smash apart everything before entering because of their persistence, but in the end, he had managed to enter the castle.</p><br/><p>But it seems like that was only the beginning.</p><br/><p>\u2018What a greeting.\u2019</p><br/><p>A castle of machines, covered in machines.</p><br/><p>Bright armor walking out from the darkness.</p><br/><p>\u201cDragon God Armor\u2026 The crystal\u2019s energy. Artificial Transcendents\u2026 He really spent a lot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Are you saying I must at least get through all this to meet you?</p><br/><p>Hansoo muttered at the air.</p><br/><p>Actually, it was quite loud.</p><br/><p>More than enough for Melchizedek to hear.</p><br/><p>And Melchizedek, who loved to talk, could have easily created a hologram before his eyes to reply.</p><br/><p>But there was no response.</p><br/><p>Which meant that there were two possibilities.</p><br/><p>\u2018Either he thinks I\u2019m not worth talking to, or\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>He was so focused on something that he didn\u2019t even have time to talk.</p><br/><p>\u2018What are you up to, Melchizedek?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked into the dark depths of the machine castle and thought to himself.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

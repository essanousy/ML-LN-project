As I expected, since there\u2019s nothing to gain here\u2026 Let\u2019s leave\u2019</p><br/><p>He had thoughts of waiting till it recovered but soon shook his head.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know how long it would take.</p><br/><p>And there was something else that was bothering him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tiamet.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tiamet, who had tried so hard to prevent him from coming here, wouldn\u2019t sit still.</p><br/><p>He would do everything he could to suppress him.</p><br/><p>He needed to prepare himself.</p><br/><p>And more than anything else.</p><br/><p>The scene he had seen through the system's panel momentarily bothered him.</p><br/><p>\u2018I need to check this all out.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo dashed out from the engine room.</p><br/><p>Whoosh.</p><br/><p>And after coming out from the structure, he could see that the situation was even worse then he had thought.</p><br/><p>There was a giant hole on the side of the ship that had plummeted into the ground.</p><br/><p>The ice storm rushed in through the giant hole and thanks to this the entire colony inside had been frozen.</p><br/><p>The lake, trees as well as the giant structure where the spirits were at.</p><br/><p>Ooooong!</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, at least the outer wall seems to be recovering a bit.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo gazed at the outer wall for a bit and then quickly rushed out.</p><br/><p>Whooosh!</p><br/><p>The moment he came outside, the storm became even harsher.</p><br/><p>As if it was telling him to stay hidden inside the ship.</p><br/><p>But the spirit\u2019s light coming out from Hansoo\u2019s body did a perfect job of protecting him.</p><br/><p>Though he had been freed from the threat of the storm, Hansoo\u2019s expression turned even darker.</p><br/><p>\u2018...As I thought. This is coming from a single location.\u2019</p><br/><p>He had been able to check the storm out much more clearly.</p><br/><p>Though it seemed like it was raging from all around, he could clearly feel it.</p><br/><p>That this giant ice storm was originating from a single location.</p><br/><p>Which meant one thing.</p><br/><p>That something was creating this storm.</p><br/><p>If it was natural, it wouldn\u2019t come out from a single point.</p><br/><p>And soon Hansoo\u2019s eyes moved towards a location.</p><br/><p>Towards the location the storm was coming from.</p><br/><p>Then something came into his view.</p><br/><p>A tower.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t large.</p><br/><p>But tall.</p><br/><p>Too tall.</p><br/><p>It was so tall that even he, who was extremely far away, could still see it.</p><br/><p>Hansoo knew.</p><br/><p>That if that mountain range, which was over 20km tall, didn\u2019t exist then everybody would know about this tower.</p><br/><p>It was that tall while also shining as well as being something that shocked the people who looked at it.</p><br/><p>A mysterious tower over a dozen kilometers tall.</p><br/><p>As he focused his eyesight, he could see the outer wall that was made of steel and various alloys.</p><br/><p>Though it was covered in ice and frost, they couldn\u2019t cover up the traces of civilizations.</p><br/><p>Hansoo then looked to the lower parts of the tower.</p><br/><p>Since what he was looking at wasn\u2019t the tower.</p><br/><p>But much below it.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo realized what he had seen through the panel was not a dream.</p><br/><p>\u201cA city\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A forest of buildings spread out below the giant tower all the way up to the base of the mountain range.</p><br/><p>There was no way to hide a giant forest of trees that were over a kilometer high despite the raging ice storm.</p><br/><p>Hansoo watched the metal forest and thought to himself.</p><br/><p>He had assumed three things before.</p><br/><p>They left.</p><br/><p>Were watching.</p><br/><p>Or had perished.</p><br/><p>Of course the only thing he was clear of was the frozen city and those three possibilities still existed.</p><br/><p>But as soon as he saw the city, he had a strong feeling about something.</p><br/><p>About what happened to them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey perished huh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo mumbled as he watched the frozen city.</p><br/><p>Hansoo gazed at the city that had completely been frozen.</p><br/><p>He also realized what the strange sensation he had been feeling up until now was.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Similar.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was strange.</p><br/><p>But not quite alien.</p><br/><p>The scene in front of him was still within his understanding.</p><br/><p>It would be like this in about a century back on earth.</p><br/><p>Hansoo decided his destination as he stared at the forest of buildings.</p><br/><p>\u2018To the tower.\u2019</p><br/><p>The spirit, who seemed to know something, had no thoughts of cooperating and he needed to figure out a way to deal with Tiamet but he didn\u2019t know where Mudusella was so he would need to figure everything out on his own.</p><br/><p>Hansoo quickly moved towards the giant tower in the center of the giant city.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

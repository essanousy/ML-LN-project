class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>Everyone made a confused expression.</p><br/><p>\u2018What is going on\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>But Chulman just sighed.</p><br/><p>What was the point of thinking such things.</p><br/><p>They were going to die soon anyway.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t matter whether he died from Minhee\u2019s hands or Youngjae\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>At that instant, something flew over at a very fast speed as it smashed his head.</p><br/><p>Puuk!</p><br/><p>\u2018Dammit\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Chulman fell unconscious as he felt his senses fade away.</p><br/><p>Youngjae, who had gotten the 8 others unconscious by throwing the daggers, walked up and chose the 9th room.</p><br/><p>Suuuururk.</p><br/><p>As he chose the in front of the 9th room, the door opened and the injuries of the people inside the room disappeared.</p><br/><p>Hansoo chuckled at the people laid around on the ground with all their injuries healed and then started to loosen up his body.</p><br/><p>\u2018Though they\u2019re a bit strong\u2026 one is easy enough\u2019.</p><br/><p>The underlings of the Dark Mad Lord are strong.</p><br/><p>Since they had not only monopolized the runes of others, but skills and artifacts as well.</p><br/><p>But that differed from person to person.</p><br/><p>And one person could be taken care of simply by releasing the hidden strength.</p><br/><p>If it doesn\u2019t work out then he could just take a blade, kill them off and just heal afterwards.</p><br/><p>Since that was his battle style anyway.</p><br/><p>\u2018Which means\u2026 this girl\u2019s artifacts are mine.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo chuckled.</p><br/><p>There was no need to run around from place to place in order to gather artifacts in the Tower.</p><br/><p>Since the underlings of the Dark Mad Lord will make their way to him by themselves.</p><br/><p>Simple.</p><br/><p>They will set some things up and bring artifacts up with them.</p><br/><p>And he just needed to cut off their heads and take those.</p><br/><p>Hansoo took the runes and artifacts that came out from her body and then showed a conspicuous color as he saw an item.</p><br/><p>\u2018Seven Stripe Cape\u2026 to wear something like this.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo made a slightly astonished expression.</p><br/><p>If she had activated this and fought then it would really have been annoying.</p><br/><p>An amazing cape that increased the defense against seven different kinds of weapons.</p><br/><p>\u2018It was hard enough fighting without the powerful artifacts but this is great.\u2019</p><br/><p>This was a huge help in his situation where his stats had decreased and where he could not use the Dekrados set.</p><br/><p>And even more so if you take into account of the fact that he would fight against other humans more often.</p><br/><p>The underlings of Dark Mad Lord will suspect him with it but they won\u2019t be able to confirm.</p><br/><p>Since it isn\u2019t the only one of its kind despite it being hard to obtain.</p><br/><p>Hansoo who had prepared some things started to ponder about his future plans.</p><br/><p>\u2018There\u2019s two stages left.\u2019</p><br/><p>If he goes through two more things then all the preparations for entering the Final Dungeon will be done.</p><br/><p>The first one of those.</p><br/><p>All the artifacts that are currently equipped on him are colorless ones.</p><br/><p>Including the Seven Stripe Cape and the Dekrados Set.</p><br/><p>But his runes will become red during the Final Dungeon.</p><br/><p>And of course he could only fight the enemy if he prepares red gear.</p><br/><p>\u2018But that\u2019s impossible.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was quite obvious actually.</p><br/><p>How would he gain red gear in the colorless stage?</p><br/><p>To do that he needed to gain a growing artifact like Nurmaha\u2019s ring and then feed it with a lot of runes to make it red.</p><br/><p>It would impossible to cover his body with such artifacts.</p><br/><p>But the thing that made it possible was the weaker version of the Philosopher\u2019s Stone.</p><br/><p>If you turn it into powder and then apply it, the quality of the energy a weapon could absorb increases by one level.</p><br/><p>Though it\u2019s not like a new skill is unlocked like with the growing artifacts, the simple fact of it being able to absorb the red energy and not the colorless energy was still a huge improvement.</p><br/><p>\u2018Though there\u2019s a time limit\u2026 it\u2019s good enough.\u2019</p><br/><p>If you take into account of the size of that Philosopher\u2019s stone then he could probably turn all his gear into red artifacts while he is inside the Final Dungeon.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m going to the room of the Treasure Hunt.\u2019</p><br/><p>This was a hidden piece which could be obtained in the 50 Man Room of the 2nd floor, at the .</p><br/><p>If you go to the 2nd floor from the 1st then another circular plaza appears and one would get into a group there again.</p><br/><p>As Hansoo moved, his whole body made crunching sounds as it changed again.</p><br/><p>Soon Youngjae had disappeared and a completely different Hansoo had appeared.</p><br/><p>He had knocked the others unconscious because of this.</p><br/><p>\u2018I can\u2019t get found out yet.\u2019</p><br/><p>Minhee had died in a single strike.</p><br/><p>Even if the messaging system existed, it was impossible to send the message about something happening suddenly.</p><br/><p>But unexpected events still happen.</p><br/><p>In order to accomplish the final level properly he couldn\u2019t get found out by the clansmen of the Dark Mad Lord yet.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s see\u2026 What should my name be this time?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo pondered for a moment and then made a simple decision.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s do Chungjae.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo chuckled as he started to walk into the darkness quickly.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Kududududu</p><br/><p>The giant room which was filled by 50 people started to move with a small noise.</p><br/><p>These were all people who had accomplished the room on the 1st floor.</p><br/><p>It had taken a whole extra day to collect 50 people.</p><br/><p>These people were mostly not part of any clans.</p><br/><p>It was actually quite reasonable since most clans had gone up to the 2nd floor right away from the start.</p><br/><p>Since most people here were people who had come up after clearing the mission on the 1st floor.</p><br/><p>\u2018Those guys have come too.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo laughed inwardly as he looked at Suhan and the others who were looking around the room.</p><br/><p>They were confused because the person who had come up before had disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well. They would probably think that I went into a different room.\u2019</p><br/><p>There were other rooms than this one on the 2nd floor.</p><br/><p>They would probably think that he had gone into one of those while they were unconscious.</p><br/><p>While they were thinking about this and that, the fairy\u2019s voice resonated throughout the room clearly:</p><br/><p>\u201cThe thing you guys will do this time is the Treasure Hunt!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe rule is very simple. You just need to search through all of the limited space here and find the treasure!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone frowned as they looked at the map and the view they could see outside of the room.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026 It\u2019s too wide.\u2019</p><br/><p>Though it was of limited space, the size of the Treasure Hunting area was almost half the size of Yeouido. (Yeouido is about 3 km\u00b2)</p><br/><p>A bit too big for 50 people to roam around in.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou just need to find this.\u201d</p><br/><p>While they were having numerous thoughts, a small spherical marble appeared in front of their eyes.</p><br/><p>A pretty normal marble, though it did shine.</p><br/><p>As everyone made strange expressions the fairy laughed as it spoke:</p><br/><p>\u201cThe treasure itself isn\u2019t an artifact but rather an exchange ticket. If you bring this to the center then I\u2019ll exchange it for you. Since there\u2019s a lot of different articles it\u2019ll be fun pondering over it too. I\u2019ll show it to you in advance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Artifacts were shown row by rows in front of their eyes.</p><br/><p>It seemed like they varied from number 1 to 50.</p><br/><p>1 artifact on number 1.</p><br/><p>And 50 of the same artifact on the 50th number.</p><br/><p>It was an obvious thought but it seemed like that the lesser the number the more precious it was.</p><br/><p>Everyone looked at the 50th one.</p><br/><p>The artifact which you could gain 50 of was just a bit better than the weapons they were holding.</p><br/><p>A useful artifcat but not really at the level of being eye-catching.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs you see it the 50th one is\u2026 well, still useful. Though it\u2019s not as good as the 1st one. Which artifact you would exchange for is up to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s gaze had already been focused on the 1st item even without the words of the Fairy.</p><br/><p>An item which boosted Charisma, Charm, Luck by 15 and the 8 base stats by 5% too.</p><br/><p>The other options were amazing too.</p><br/><p>If you take into account that runes would be very hard to gain from now on, the price of this item was not even comparable to the other ones.</p><br/><p>Even if it wasn\u2019t the 1st item, items up to number 10 were pretty amazing and items up to 30 were items that were a bit hard to gain by hunting.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly when you bring the Treasure and exchange for the price in the center the door to the next room will open. No one can leave before that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Not being able to leave was something they had already heard.</p><br/><p>They had come in here after taking that into account.</p><br/><p>The situation wouldn\u2019t be different in other rooms as well so it was just better to start as soon as possible when 50 people had gathered.</p><br/><p>And who knows?</p><br/><p>They might find the treasure if they\u2019re lucky.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s start! Heehee.\u201d</p><br/><p>With those final words the room clunked and stopped.</p><br/><p>And a giant jungle had appeared in front of them.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hmm\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>The people glanced at each other and then separated into the giant jungle.</p><br/><p>Being in a team was not always the best option in such a place.</p><br/><p>Actually it might be harder to find if you are grouped.</p><br/><p>But just before everyone was apart to separate, the fairy\u2019s voice resonated throughout the air.</p><br/><p>And then the images of the protectors appeared in air.</p><br/><p>All 128 of them.</p><br/><p>Everyone saw this and then frowned their faces.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fuck. It\u2019s not something I can kill alone\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>They realized instantly.</p><br/><p>Though they had gotten quite a bit of skills and runes, it was not something they could solve with just that much.</p><br/><p>It was at the level where they at least needed about 5 people to hunt it down safely.</p><br/><p>The people who were dispersing flinched.</p><br/><p>Since they did not have any confidence in fighting those things alone.</p><br/><p>But there was no need for all 50 of them to group up.</p><br/><p>One person shouted loudly in the center.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there anybody who would go with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone started to size each other up as they started to group up in tens or so.</p><br/><p>The good thing about this treasure hunt was that multiple people could share the result.</p><br/><p>Since they couldn\u2019t do anything alone, it was better to group up and act together.</p><br/><p>There were actually a few people who weren\u2019t interested in the treasure among the crowd.</p><br/><p>Since it seemed like it was better to hunt for runes in the time where they would fight to earn some crappy thing.</p><br/><p>\u2018And as I heard the explanation earlier, it seems like normal beasts gave artifacts too.\u2019</p><br/><p>It seemed like that the beasts were pretty good in giving out runes and artifacts in this place.</p><br/><p>Which means the artifacts around the level of those in 40 to 50th spot were faster to earn through hunting.</p><br/><p>At that moment a voice was heard in the air.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It meant that no matter how strong they were they would all get massacred if one crazy guy exchanged the treasure for only one artifact and left this place.</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s expressions turned hard.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>Wongyung nodded at the clansman\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026 we should start too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUuuuaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wongyung laughed in joy whilst looking at the room which was already in chaos as he moved his steps.</p><br/><p>Proofreader\u2019s note</p><br/><p>A glossary has been made listing major information/characters. This is in answer to some comments that Korean names are too hard to remember.</p><br/><p>Some clarifications: Hansoo assumed the name Youngjae in last chapter, and now being in the new group he gets a new appearance and a new name: Chungjae. There\u2019s a single treasure (shining marble) to find in the room, then it can be exchanged at the altar for 1 to 50 prizes. Only people holding one of those prizes can leave the room, the others will die. The treasure is guarded by one of the 128 Protectors, but it\u2019s unknown which one.</p><br/><p>Last regular chapter of the week will most likely come on Sunday.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

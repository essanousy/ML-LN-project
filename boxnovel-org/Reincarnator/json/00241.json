What the hell?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this? Is it a quest?\u201d</p><br/><p>Rummble.</p><br/><p>The players felt the entire maze shake and made confused expressions.</p><br/><p>Since the entire giant maze was shaking in a strange way.</p><br/><p>For most of them who didn\u2019t know what was below, this didn\u2019t mean anything so they were just confused about it.</p><br/><p>But for a few others, it was different.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck! We need more Ram Manon Eyes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSuppress it! The Seal is going to break at this rate!\u201d</p><br/><p>All the magic brigade members above were thrown into a hectic state.</p><br/><p>People whose average level was 290, those who didn\u2019t even consider players as bugs were all in a frenzy.</p><br/><p>From their dimensional pouches, countless magic ingredients flew out into the giant rune-shaped formation around the maze.</p><br/><p>The one kilometer-wide giant magic formation that surrounded the area around the maze shone with numerous colors and started to bind the entire maze.</p><br/><p>As if it was trying to suppress something that could not be let out.</p><br/><p>And Arthus Krancheska, who was managing the whole thing, grinded his teeth.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fucking hell! What the fuck are these immortal bastards doing inside!\u2019</p><br/><p>He could understand the seal having shaken a bit from the work of the bastards from the Korin Kingdom.</p><br/><p>But for the entire seal itself to be shaking.</p><br/><p>This only meant one thing.</p><br/><p>That some bastard had gone into the core area of the seal, where the God\u2019s Flail lay, and was ripping apart the actual seal itself.</p><br/><p>The surrounding air around Arthus Krancheska started to burn up and caused the temperature to rise.</p><br/><p>This was a sign of his rage.</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know which bastard is doing this\u2026 But if I catch you, I\u2019m going to rip you apart.\u2019</p><br/><p>Arthus Krancheska continued to grind his teeth.</p><br/><p>He had heard hundreds of times about the dangers of the Ains.</p><br/><p>That this seal was the artifact that kept the humans safe.</p><br/><p>This was the symbol which signified the winner between the humans and Ains from the that happened a thousand years ago.</p><br/><p>But some bastard was breaking this apart.</p><br/><p>With brute force too.</p><br/><p>\u2018Scarlet Demons...You bastards. Hurry and restore the minor seal! Suppress the curse!\u201d</p><br/><p>He wanted to go in himself but he couldn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>The curse of the Ains was too powerful.</p><br/><p>His own life was important as well.</p><br/><p>As long as the minor seal wasn\u2019t in place on the 1st floor, going in would be dangerous.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn...If the commander came himself, we could\u2019ve just gone in.\u2019</p><br/><p>Arthus Krancheska frowned.</p><br/><p>The commander.</p><br/><p>The commander of the magic brigade who was as powerful as a Great General, someone of his level could deal with the situation even if the curse of the Ains tied him down.</p><br/><p>Even if he was weakened, his power level was different to begin with.</p><br/><p>But he himself was not at that level yet.</p><br/><p>If he got weakened from the curse, even those bugs could be a threat to him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn. I can\u2019t help it, there\u2019s no time. Ugh, no one here is likable.\u2019</p><br/><p>As Arthus Krancheska frowned at the thought of the Korin Kingdom.</p><br/><p>Oooooong.</p><br/><p>Arthus Krancheska, who was watching over the seal, felt a strange mana shockwave.</p><br/><p>Arthus Krancheska\u2019s expression brightened up at the mana shockwave.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes. Those immortal scrubs are doing their job properly.\u2019</p><br/><p>This shockwave meant that the seal was being restructured around the Jewel of the Dead.</p><br/><p>In the blue pouch he gave them, there were materials to reform the minor seal.</p><br/><p>If one destroyed the Jewel of the Dead and spread the powder inside the pouch, the minor seal would start to form again and the curse would disappear.</p><br/><p>Arthus Krancheska opened and closed his fists as he felt the minor seal being fixed at a slow pace.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hurry\u2026 And get fixed.\u2019</p><br/><p>The moment it would get fixed.</p><br/><p>He would charge into the 4th floor and smash down everyone.</p><br/><p>The ones who were breaking the seal.</p><br/><p>However, he was actually relieved.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yeah...No matter what they do, they can\u2019t break the seal apart entirely.\u2019</p><br/><p>The seal which their ancestors had placed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fall into despair\u2026 And just wait.\u2019</p><br/><p>Arthus Krancheska stared vehemently towards the depths of the maze with.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>The adventurer\u2019s expressions froze as they heard the sound.</p><br/><p>\u2018They\u2019re here.\u2019</p><br/><p>A trap which was set to react once enough players were within the area.</p><br/><p>The activation of that thing symbolized something.</p><br/><p>That the Scarlet Demons had chased them all the way to here.</p><br/><p>Whooosh!</p><br/><p>A scorching heat started to charge in from the distance.</p><br/><p>Which meant that Sharon Stiller was already here.</p><br/><p>Kamiyou looked at Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cMister Hansoo! Let\u2019s fight!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018We can win!\u2019</p><br/><p>Despair fell the moment hope was just within their grasp.</p><br/><p>Right before the seal broke, the ones chasing them had caught up.</p><br/><p>But then it wasn\u2019t necessarily that bad.</p><br/><p>At least they could now understand what it felt to see hope within this damned world.</p><br/><p>\u2018Once we get rid of them\u2026 And break the seal!\u2019</p><br/><p>Though there would be a lot of casualties, they could see something.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t know what would happen but they could still feel something.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo\u2019s expression was grim.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t fight them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat...Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was unsure up until now but it was now clear.</p><br/><p>A powerful aura existed around powerful people.</p><br/><p>And the current Hansoo who had the look of a dragon was more than enough to smash down all those guys charging towards them.</p><br/><p>Someone who could deal with the Scarlet Demons.</p><br/><p>If they fought by themselves, they would almost surely get annihilated.</p><br/><p>Since having and not having someone to deal with the Scarlet Demons was a huge difference.</p><br/><p>Hansoo spoke as he placed his hand on the seal.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe minor seal is being fixed.\u2019</p><br/><p>He could sense it from the flow of mana.</p><br/><p>Somebody was fixing the minor seal from above.</p><br/><p>And once it was fixed?</p><br/><p>\u2018...Somebody would definitely come down charging.\u2019</p><br/><p>The magic brigade of the kingdoms wouldn\u2019t just sit and watch as the seal got fixed.</p><br/><p>The commander of the magic brigade.</p><br/><p>Or the captain.</p><br/><p>One of the two would definitely come down here.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well. I guess the one who would come down here is the captain.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo mumbled.</p><br/><p>Thinking about the situation with the surrounded countries and the fact that they hadn\u2019t charged down yet, it was clear that the captain was in charge.</p><br/><p>Well that didn\u2019t really matter.</p><br/><p>If Arthus Krancheska came down here after the seal was fixed, they would all die.</p><br/><p>He wouldn\u2019t be able to deal with a monster at level 330.</p><br/><p>He needed to break the Great Seal before the minor seal was fixed no matter what.</p><br/><p>Kamiyou\u2019s expression turned dark as he heard Hansoo\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy god...Then..!\u201d</p><br/><p>He finally understood the situation.</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t fight.</p><br/><p>For them to have a limited amount of time.</p><br/><p>They had to split into two teams where one blocked the ones charging at them and the other continued breaking the seal.</p><br/><p>Until the seal finally broke.</p><br/><p>Kamiyou spoke towards his surrounding.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeople who are relatively higher-leveled fight. The others will pull the chain.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone clenched their teeth and nodded.</p><br/><p>Of course pulling the chain was safer than fighting.</p><br/><p>But in terms of efficiency, this was much better.</p><br/><p>Though there wasn\u2019t much different of physical strength between a level 200 and 250, the battle strength which came from their masteries and artifacts was very different.</p><br/><p>A high-level adventurer pulling chains was a waste in a lot of ways.</p><br/><p>Einchel smacked Christopher and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cWeaklings go over there and play tug of war. This sister will be fighting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...Fucking hell.\u201d</p><br/><p>Christopher made an embarrassed expression but did not retort.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t the time to step out.</p><br/><p>The task be was entrusted with was just as important.</p><br/><p>If he couldn\u2019t pull out the chain while they were fighting, they would all die.</p><br/><p>\u2018...We just need to pull this out?\u2019</p><br/><p>Christopher walked up to the chain and stood in front of it.</p><br/><p>Well, in front of the bloody red object the chain was attached to.</p><br/><p>A giant metal object was protruding out from the ground on the end of the chain.</p><br/><p>And Christopher finally realized why this was called a flail.</p><br/><p>A human-head-sized metal object that resembled a bell, or an anvil.</p><br/><p>The flail was actually covered by hundreds of veins that resembled the veins within a human\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>The hundreds of the bloody mana currents that were tying down the flail had been dragged out along with the flail.</p><br/><p>Blood didn\u2019t flow through these veins but the energy from the mana node did.</p><br/><p>This actually made those veins look even redder than actual veins.</p><br/><p>Christopher decided to call these things veins and realized what they were connected to.</p><br/><p>\u2018...They come out from below those crosses huh.\u2019</p><br/><p>Christopher made a terrified expression at the strange veins but still grabbed onto the chain.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yeah. It wouldn\u2019t take long.\u2019</p><br/><p>It seems he would just need to rip out the flail from the veins.</p><br/><p>How hard would it be to cut apart something that already came out onto the ground.</p><br/><p>Crrrrrk.</p><br/><p>As Christopher pulled onto the chain.</p><br/><p>Chiiiiiik!</p><br/><p>Strange red lights exploded out from the veins along with an intense wave of heat.</p><br/><p>At the same time.</p><br/><p>Tttdddk!</p><br/><p>The chains that had stayed linked despite hundreds of people with monstrous strengths pulling on it melted in an instant.</p><br/><p>And Christopher made a dumbfounded expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the fuck\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The veins which gave off a wave of powerful energy and intense hatred freaked out Christopher.</p><br/><p>The more surprising thing was the flail.</p><br/><p>Despite being surrounded by hundreds of veins that had melted the chain in an instant, it stood intact.</p><br/><p>Christopher grinded his teeth as he watched the hunk of metal become red hot.</p><br/><p>\u2018...We have to pull that thing out?\u2019</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Christopher\u2019s right hand, Elenoia, slashed down with her dagger and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can just break these!\u201d</p><br/><p>The seal would break the moment they rip apart the veins from the flail.</p><br/><p>And they could just cut the veins off instead of pulling the veins out.</p><br/><p>\u2018There\u2019s no time!\u2019</p><br/><p>They needed to deal with the seal as quickly as possible.</p><br/><p>As Elenoia was about to slash down with her dagger.</p><br/><p>Grab.</p><br/><p>Hansoo grabbed Elenoia\u2019s wrist and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to die, don\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As Elenoia made a shocked expression.</p><br/><p>Hansoo spoke towards the flail.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t break this thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>As long as the mana node existed, the veins would reform and the seal would stay intact.</p><br/><p>If one struck it, they would just get killed from the heat.</p><br/><p>There were no traps or beasts that defended the seal.</p><br/><p>There was no need for such a thing.</p><br/><p>The flail was surrounded by a tremendous amount of these veins that existed as its guard.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, more like a test.\u2019</p><br/><p>The higher the numbering, the harder something was to obtain.</p><br/><p>The God\u2019s Flail was no exception.</p><br/><p>The final trial that one needed to go through in order to obtain it.</p><br/><p>They needed to get its approval.</p><br/><p>\u201cHoo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s go.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo watched the heated up flail as he breathed in and out.</p><br/><p>Chiiiiiik.</p><br/><p>He then grabbed the flail.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

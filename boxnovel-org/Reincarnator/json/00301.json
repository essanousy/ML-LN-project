Don\u2019t slow down!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKeep using the scans and don\u2019t stop looking around!\u201d</p><br/><p>Though the might of their skills showed how strong they were, none of them looked the slightest proud.</p><br/><p>Their expressions only showed hurry.</p><br/><p>Rumble.</p><br/><p>After a bit of running, a red light exploded out from one of the 2 pairs of males and females.</p><br/><p>Kiiiiing!</p><br/><p>As the girl felt nothing being caught in the red light that swept around their surroundings, she shouted at her comrades in relief.</p><br/><p>\u201cPhew! Slow down! They aren\u2019t following us anymore!\u201d</p><br/><p>The three people cursed out loud as the stopped.</p><br/><p>\u201cFucking\u2026 Haaa. Are they really gone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFucking Dakramas.\u201d</p><br/><p>The 4 sat down on the spot while cursing out at the Abyssal race, the Dakramas.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fuck. We\u2019ve come too far. Really far. Damn\u2026 For us to become like this the moment we come up from the 3rd zone to the 4th.\u2019</p><br/><p>Taesang, the temporary leader of this small group, frowned as he checked his surroundings.</p><br/><p>A mountain range covered in snow and blizzard.</p><br/><p>Though parts of the mountain range had been destroyed, the 2 years of blizzard did a very good job of hiding a lot of the damage.</p><br/><p>Apparently a huge explosion had occurred here 2 years ago.</p><br/><p>The Green Zone of the past.</p><br/><p>A huge explosion which shook this entire place, which was now called for the 4th zone.</p><br/><p>And the change that came afterwards.</p><br/><p>That day was named the .</p><br/><p>The day when the steel pillars smashed through the ceilings of the 7 zones and landed.</p><br/><p>The Seven Zones had changed a lot.</p><br/><p>To some, it was a very welcome change.</p><br/><p>And to some, to newcomers like them, a very unfortunate change.</p><br/><p>\u2018For this huge chaos\u2026 To have been caused by one person.\u2019</p><br/><p>Kang Hansoo.</p><br/><p>Taesang looked around as he thought of the legendary name that evoked both good and bad meanings.</p><br/><p>A girl standing next to Taesang spoke in dejection.</p><br/><p>\u201c...I want to eat pork belly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDumb bitch. Get used to it. We\u2019ve been in this bloody world for over a year already.\u201d</p><br/><p>Taesang looked at the girl, Misun, and scolded her.</p><br/><p>Though it wasn\u2019t a long time to adapt, there was nothing else they could do.</p><br/><p>They needed to adapt in order to survive.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn. We were the best back in the 3rd zone.\u2019</p><br/><p>From the 1st zone to the 3rd which were respectively called Red, Orange and Yellow Zones in the past.</p><br/><p>They had charged through with their friends.</p><br/><p>But the 4th zone.</p><br/><p>The Green Zone.</p><br/><p>This world, created by the man called Kang Hansoo, was the materialization of hell.</p><br/><p>\u2018Kang Hansoo\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>While Taesang was thinking about this name.</p><br/><p>One of the females, the one who had sent out the red light just before, called out to him and the others.</p><br/><p>\u201cYo guys\u2026 Do you guys know what this is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The adventurers approached her and looked at the thing she was pointing at.</p><br/><p>\u201c...What the fuck?\u201d</p><br/><p>Past the horizon.</p><br/><p>There was a huge hole in the middle of the broken down mountain range.</p><br/><p>As if it had been hit by a meteor.</p><br/><p>And within this huge hole.</p><br/><p>There was a round, silvery object.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Egg? What the hell?\u2019</p><br/><p>They frowned as they looked at the silvery egg in the center of this hole.</p><br/><p>And there was another thing.</p><br/><p>There was a small box next to this egg.</p><br/><p>A small box the size of a pencil case.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hmm...Weird.\u2019</p><br/><p>These two things should not be in the middle of nowhere like this.</p><br/><p>This place wasn\u2019t within the territory of the humans.</p><br/><p>Taesang turned his gaze away from the strange egg and the box and spoke to Lauren.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you feel anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>The scout, Lauren, shook her head.</p><br/><p>They could only barely find the location of the egg with the skill, they had no way of finding out what was within it.</p><br/><p>The mysterious egg was doing a great job of separating what was inside it from the outside world, including shielding the powers of the skills.</p><br/><p>\u2018It was lucky to find it as well.\u2019</p><br/><p>Lauren mumbled as she looked at the egg in the center of the huge remnant of an explosion.</p><br/><p>Actually she was feeling uneasy standing here.</p><br/><p>\u2018I can feel traces of a tremendously powerful being.\u2019</p><br/><p>Though most of the traces had been covered by the snow, she could still feel it.</p><br/><p>The power that swept through the surroundings.</p><br/><p>And if some power hadn\u2019t destroyed the mountains, people like them wouldn\u2019t even have been able to approach this egg.</p><br/><p>\u2018Apparently nobody has come all the way to this place yet.\u2019</p><br/><p>Though they had come all the way to this location by coincidence, it was still within the territory of the Dakramas.</p><br/><p>A stay-away zone for them.</p><br/><p>\u2018Perhaps\u2026 He\u2019s a transcendent?\u2019</p><br/><p>A completely different existence from them.</p><br/><p>A small amount of monstrous beings who had been born after the Abyss descended.</p><br/><p>\u2018No way.\u2019</p><br/><p>As Lauren made a expression full of disbelief, Taesang continued to frown.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>If this originated from the Abyss then the first steps in handling it would be extremely important.</p><br/><p>Since the 2nd floor of the 4th zone, which had ignored the mysterious object from the Abyss at first, had now become a land of death. (TN: I guess there\u2019s 2 floors of each zones now? Not enough information on this to clarify.)</p><br/><p>Since that specific mysterious object was the infected host of the Abyssal Race, the Aroels.</p><br/><p>\u2018Should we take it back?\u2019</p><br/><p>The moment Taesang put his hand on the egg.</p><br/><p>Paaaajaaajajaak!</p><br/><p>\u201cUaaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>Taesang freaked out.</p><br/><p>His energy was furiously being sucked into the egg.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fuck...I can\u2019t take my hand off!\u2019</p><br/><p>As he was freaking out.</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>Misun figured something was wrong and kicked him far into the corner and away from the egg.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhuk!....Fucking bitch! Kick more softly!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you saying? I just saved you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Misun turned back to the egg in fear.</p><br/><p>She had also been in danger for a short moment her own energy got sucked into the egg the moment she kicked Taesang.</p><br/><p>Though she didn\u2019t know what was inside that egg, it was clear that it was extremely dangerous.</p><br/><p>Even if they used skills on it, it would probably absorb the skills\u2019 energy.</p><br/><p>Misun spoke to Taesang who was walking back while complaining quietly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYo, let\u2019s just go. Ignore this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust go?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, we have no time to mess around like this either. It\u2019s not like we completely escaped them anyway.\u201d</p><br/><p>Taesang pondered for a moment but then nodded.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yeah\u2026 We have no time to waste.\u2019</p><br/><p>The egg didn\u2019t feel safe and they didn\u2019t have any time to play around here.</p><br/><p>But they couldn\u2019t just leave.</p><br/><p>\u2018If the egg\u2019s a no go then at least that box\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Taesang put his hand on the box.</p><br/><p>Thankfully, it didn\u2019t suck in his energy or anything.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s try opening it.\u2019</p><br/><p>Taesang picked up the box and tried to open it.</p><br/><p>But it was useless, despite his strength which could even pry apart a car.</p><br/><p>\u2018...It\u2019s not opening?\u2019</p><br/><p>Kuududuuk.</p><br/><p>The small box seemed to not care about Taesang\u2019s strength at all as it remained unmoved.</p><br/><p>He even used the reinforcement given to him by a high ranker in the 1st zone, the but the box remained the same.</p><br/><p>\u2018...I guess I\u2019ll just have to take it.\u2019</p><br/><p>Though it was hard for them here, someone stronger than them existed back in the base.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, at least we got something.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since they memorized the coordinates, they could return at any time.</p><br/><p>It was time to leave.</p><br/><p>Lauren nodded and the 4 people quickly disappeared into the snow.</p><br/><p>And near the spot where the box was, only the mysterious egg remained behind and slowly disappeared under the snow.</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>Kwadddduduk!</p><br/><p>A hang broke through the egg.</p><br/><p>Crack.</p><br/><p>Craaaacck.</p><br/><p>As the egg broke apart.</p><br/><p>The silvery egg turned into liquid as it started to get sucked back into the man.</p><br/><p>And soon.</p><br/><p>A man walked out.</p><br/><p>A thin but lean body.</p><br/><p>Crunch.</p><br/><p>Crackle.</p><br/><p>\u2018...I\u2019ve come out a bit earlier than expected huh.\u2019</p><br/><p>The man, Kang Hansoo, examined his body which seemed to have shrunk a bit as he mumbled.</p><br/><p>He thought that he would have to absorb the energy for about another week but thanks to a small burst of excess energy, he had been able to come out faster.</p><br/><p>\u2018Anyways\u2026 Who was it?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo frowned as he looked around.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t talking about the people who had just been here.</p><br/><p>A bit before that.</p><br/><p>Hansoo thought back to the words he had heard while being inside the egg.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s not here.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked at the ground.</p><br/><p>\u2018Look at these brats.\u2019</p><br/><p>He could still see the footprints of the four people.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

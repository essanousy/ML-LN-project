For a guard to do such a thing like this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Keron and a few others coming down for some dirty work was understandable.</p><br/><p>Since those guys were the ones who shoved them down here.</p><br/><p>But for a guard, who should be keeping the rules of the village in check, to come down to do the same thing.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn bastards. Wasn\u2019t playing around with us like that enough!?\u2019</p><br/><p>But Hansoo shook his head at the girl\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am not a guard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo finished his words and then looked into the distance.</p><br/><p>Countless people, from the depths of the darkness, were running towards this location after hearing the commotion.</p><br/><p>At least 200.</p><br/><p>It was not a coincidental number.</p><br/><p>\u2018Oh yeah, I\u2019ve heard about this.\u2019</p><br/><p>Even Hansoo hadn\u2019t inspected and adventured through every nook and cranny of the yellow zone.</p><br/><p>Since there were countless villages in many ceasefire zones throughout the entire zone.</p><br/><p>Though all these villages operated in a similar manner due to all of them having been created by Clementine, there were still differences.</p><br/><p>And he had heard about a special village out of those.</p><br/><p>That there were people who shoved others into a secret location and operated a human farm.</p><br/><p>\u2018These guys must be them.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The 200 people who had run over here looked at Hansoo with confusion, worry and fear.</p><br/><p>And their leader, Mackill, looked at Hansoo with a heavy expression.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hansoo huh. What are his motives?.\u2019</p><br/><p>There were about 200 people who had been thrown here.</p><br/><p>But these guys were the weakest out of the weakest.</p><br/><p>People who were farming in the village and were kidnapped by the Hunters of the 1st area.</p><br/><p>Basically, they were the rabbits of the jungle.</p><br/><p>Of course the others targeted them.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fucking bastards\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Karhal should be damned as well.</p><br/><p>But Keron and the others, who had thrown them in here in the first place, and came down periodically to play with them were the worst.</p><br/><p>The reason for them being thrown in here was simple.</p><br/><p>Since there weren\u2019t that many Farmers who they could play with as they pleased.</p><br/><p>They judged that it would be better to keep them trapped in here and to play with them.</p><br/><p>And their choices weren\u2019t wrong.</p><br/><p>Since the carrier pigeons could not fly in this depths of darkness.</p><br/><p>And it was so high that them, Farmers, did not have the ability to go up.</p><br/><p>No, there was still a problem after getting up there.</p><br/><p>Since the moment Keron and the others, who scout the Okun Tree daily, find them then they would just get dropped back down again.</p><br/><p>They were many who tried to escape at first but as these events repeated themselves the 200 people stopped resisting.</p><br/><p>Since it was better to stay alive then to die.</p><br/><p>Even if they were slaves.</p><br/><p>But the man in front of them was different.</p><br/><p>\u2018He doesn\u2019t have any looks of crazed greed in his eyes either\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>It looked like he actually knew of their existence in the first place.</p><br/><p>Mackill emptied her mind and sighed as she asked Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith what motives have you come down here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo replied simply.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe place where you got the items you are holding onto. I have something to do there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026You know about that?\u201d</p><br/><p>As the people asked with a confused expression, Hansoo merely nodded.</p><br/><p>There were a few things he needed to take from the research labs.</p><br/><p>Mackill lifted the glove and necklace she had on her person and then asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe took most of the useful stuff\u2026 Are you talking about these?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo shook his head.</p><br/><p>Those were just simple items.</p><br/><p>Actually he wouldn\u2019t be able to use that item any better than these people.</p><br/><p>Though the Body Enhancement Surgery and Dragon Essence Blade gifted a powerful body, it did not gift one a large quantity of mana.</p><br/><p>The amount of mana he had was actually lower than theirs.</p><br/><p>Their mana rune progress was around 5% but his was even lower.</p><br/><p>Those items weren\u2019t his goal in the first place.</p><br/><p>\u2018From what I know\u2026the Sealing Jade is in the deepest parts of the lab.\u2019</p><br/><p>The invention the Sages had invented without the knowledge of the higher races, .</p><br/><p>It hadn\u2019t been destroyed because its existence wasn\u2019t known but it was located in the deepest part of the research lab.</p><br/><p>Hansoo spoke out.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease guide me to that location.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mackill, the leader of the farmers, replied to Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell. It seems like something beneficial to you but\u2026What do we get?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo answered simply.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to go out?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone started to mumble between each other.</p><br/><p>To be able to go out.</p><br/><p>There was nothing better than that.</p><br/><p>Though they were living because it was still better than death, a life of a slave wasn\u2019t quite what they hoped for.</p><br/><p>No, they weren\u2019t even slaves.</p><br/><p>They were being treated as livestock.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bastards.\u2019</p><br/><p>Mackill grinded her teeth from Keron\u2019s words in the past.</p><br/><p>But she shook his head soon afterwards.</p><br/><p>\u2018That is not possible.\u2019</p><br/><p>Trapping them and treating them as slaves was the worst type of felony possible.</p><br/><p>Karhal, Keron and the other hunters of the 1st Area would receive a harsher punishment than death if the Farmers here were to escape and reach the village.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think those guys will leave us alive? There\u2019s a reason why those guys scout around the Okun Tree every day!\u201d</p><br/><p>They were indeed scouting around the Okun Tree in case of something comes out from the darkness.</p><br/><p>But they weren\u2019t doing it because something dangerous might come out.</p><br/><p>It was the opposite of that actually.</p><br/><p>They were doing so in order to keep the slaves in there.</p><br/><p>Mackill laughed as she looked at Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand that you are strong. But I can figure out how strong you are after fighting with you. You are definitely not strong enough to fight 40 of the 1st Area Hunters by yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone around Mackill nodded.</p><br/><p>Though they had extremely screwed up personalities, they were still very strong.</p><br/><p>There was a reason why around ten of them came down here in the first place.</p><br/><p>Since the 10 of them had the confidence to fight 200 of them.</p><br/><p>40 of them was a whole another story.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd what are you going to do? Though not all the 1st Area Hunters participated in this human farm but it\u2019s not like they are innocent. Which means even the ones who don\u2019t know anything will be punished by the village. You think those guys will side with us?\u2019</p><br/><p>Mackill was angry.</p><br/><p>In conclusion, the 40 Hunters of the 1st Area will combine all their strength to erase their existence.</p><br/><p>Since it wouldn\u2019t be a sin if they don\u2019t get caught.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t have the abilities then instead of giving us false hope just fuck off. You damned bastard. We will at least be able to live without you.\u201d</p><br/><p>As long as Hansoo wasn\u2019t here it would be okay.</p><br/><p>Then the Hunters wouldn\u2019t have a reason to massacre the Farmers trapped in here.</p><br/><p>The Hunters just needed to wait until the 1 year contract they had with the village ended and leave.</p><br/><p>\u2018And\u2026 We will remain as slaves.\u2019</p><br/><p>They had attacked in glee after only detecting one when usually ten people came down at once.</p><br/><p>Since one could be dealt with.</p><br/><p>They were going to take one hostage and go onto the next level.</p><br/><p>But the full force coming down here was a different story.</p><br/><p>\u2018Nothing can be done. It\u2019s better to live than to die.\u2019</p><br/><p>Mackill clenched her teeth.</p><br/><p>If they attempted to escape with this guy then they would all get massacred.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you aren\u2019t going to tell me anything? Even the location of the research lab?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mackill nodded at Hansoo\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. If we get caught by the Hunters after helping you then it\u2019ll only hurt us. We will\u2026 Remain the way we are right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those guys were vicious enough already.</p><br/><p>If they get caught then they couldn\u2019t even imagine what would happen to them.</p><br/><p>Since they were merely slaves to fulfill the Hunter\u2019s desires and greed.</p><br/><p>Hansoo decided to end the conversation after seeing Mackill say those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are quite amusing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mackill made a nervous expression while looking at Hansoo\u2019s expressionless gaze.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe guys above can kill all of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut so can I. Aren\u2019t I not frightening to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tremble.</p><br/><p>A chill ran along Mackill\u2019s entire body.</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s calm eyes were inspecting every of them.</p><br/><p>\u2018Of course I don\u2019t have any thoughts of killing them\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>It would only work if he at least did this much.</p><br/><p>And it would only benefit them the faster he found the Sealing Jade.</p><br/><p>Hansoo spoke towards Mackill.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuide me. To the research lab.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Damn.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mackill grinded her teeth.</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>One of the lookout who was staring at the entrance up above shouted out urgently.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn! Mackill! This is bad!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFucking hell. What could be worse than this current\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As Mackill spat out those words, the lookout shouted back loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck! All of them are coming down man! All of them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? How many?\u201d</p><br/><p>The lookout replied with a heavy expression.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Forty. All of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way. Why so suddenly\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Mackill made an expression of disbelief.</p><br/><p>The existence of the human farm wasn\u2019t known to all the 1st Area Hunters.</p><br/><p>All 40 of them could not have come down just to play with them.</p><br/><p>But Mackill figured it out almost instantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cKang Hansoo! You fucki\u2026What did you do up above!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mackill spat out in misery.</p><br/><p>She wanted to curse out but the eyes Hansoo had shown her before were simply too terrifying.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>A loud shout was heard from up above.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha! Have you been well?! Our precious female piggy Mackill!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Keron, this bastard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mackill grinded her teeth in anger.</p><br/><p>The entire farm looked towards Mackill with sympathy even during the tension but then soon made bitter expressions instead.</p><br/><p>Since their situations weren\u2019t that much different.</p><br/><p>Keron, who was still hanging high above on the entrance, looked around his livestock in contentment.</p><br/><p>Gazes filled with fear.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yeah. This is it.\u2019</p><br/><p>Keron was but a cog in the village.</p><br/><p>But it was different here.</p><br/><p>It was like being a god.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn\u2026I didn\u2019t want to show this to Karhal.\u2019</p><br/><p>Keron made an amused expression at first but then frowned as he looked at Karhal.</p><br/><p>He was the king of this place.</p><br/><p>Of course somebody being above him would not feel good.</p><br/><p>This was why he only told a few weaker ones and enjoyed this place together.</p><br/><p>And since Karhal now had knowledge of this place, he wasn\u2019t the absolute authority here anymore.</p><br/><p>Keron looked towards Hansoo, the reason for all of this, and grinded his teeth.</p><br/><p>Hansoo even had a laid back expression.</p><br/><p>His expression contradicting with the expressions of the ones standing next to him pissed Keron even more.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s see if your expression will be the same after this.\u2019</p><br/><p>Keron suddenly thought of something fun as he looked at Hansoo who was standing in the middle of the farmers.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hmm. Wait a minute\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Keron looked towards the farm below and shouted loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cOrdering you livestocks! Attack that trash over there and kill him! Hahaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Karhal made an amused expression, Keron felt a little depressed.</p><br/><p>Since he could sense Karhal standing above him.</p><br/><p>Keron grinded his teeth quietly and then gave an even better offer to relieve that stress.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo the ones who do the best I will give more food! We will watch from up here! The ones who don\u2019t fight\u2026You know right? Start!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFucking hell\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Whether they fight or not, they would all get killed anyway.</p><br/><p>Mackill made a dumbfounded expression at Keron\u2019s shouts.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It had the ability to provide a comfortable haven for all of mankind and had the firepower to destroy approaching foreign enemies, not to mention the countless information that was contained within the ark itself.</p><br/><p>Although the barrier between the Abyss and the Otherworld had not completely collapsed, this ark would be a great aid to humanity if the wall that stood against the Abyss were to fall in the future.</p><br/><p>In other words, it wasn't strange if Hansoo coveted the ark.</p><br/><p>Yet, that was precisely why they couldn't give up this ark.</p><br/><p>What was the purpose of the development of this ark?</p><br/><p>It was because they did not want to fight directly in battle.</p><br/><p>No matter how strong they were, no one would be willing to enter a fight with bare fists without a gun. </p><br/><p>Their strong power, mana and soul were more adept to deal with enemies with the power and knowledge of their civilization. </p><br/><p>However, if they didn't possess the ark?</p><br/><p>Even if their species were to survive, they must wander around the Abyss with their bare bodies. </p><br/><p>He really hated that.</p><br/><p>If they were to leave traces of their power, civilization and the Blue Sunlight Jade, even he was aware of how long it would take to rebuild their civilization again.</p><br/><p>For all those years, they would have to wallow in the Abyss like primitive men.</p><br/><p>That would be too shallow.</p><br/><p>'That kind of treatment\u2026 would be enough for the wild animals in front of them.'</p><br/><p>They didn't want to go that far, which was why he decided to ask for more.</p><br/><p>Seeing Hansoo staying silent, Noah opened his mouth once again.</p><br/><p>\\\"Anyway\u2026 We have no choice. We have no future without this ark. If you refuse\u2026 I'll just bury everyone here including you.\\\"</p><br/><p>In a way, this was a bluff.</p><br/><p>It wasn't like they would all die without the ark.</p><br/><p>However, he must make him think that he would not step down any further. Only then would he accept his threats.</p><br/><p>Hansoo, who was contemplating momentarily, nodded.</p><br/><p>\\\"Alright. Prepare.\\\"</p><br/><p>Noah's expression was brightened by Hansoo's words.</p><br/><p>----------------------------------------------------</p><br/><p>Rumble!</p><br/><p>Watching Noah working on the process of stabilizing the large Red Jades, Hansoo flew toward a presence that he was familiar with.</p><br/><p>'I can't do that anyway.'</p><br/><p>Whether he was bluffing or not, it was undeniable that only he could stabilize those Red Jades.</p><br/><p>On the surface, the Red Jades seemed crude, but they were delicate crystals of technological prowess.</p><br/><p>It was not something that could be controlled simply by force.</p><br/><p>It was proof seeing how the 7-Star man was doing all he could to suppress the Red Jades.</p><br/><p>He could never do that.</p><br/><p>If he were to kill him, the trembling Red Jades would have burst in place and have swept over the entire place.</p><br/><p>'It's ridiculous to have such events occur when it's so close in front of you.'</p><br/><p>Hansoo, chuckling, quickly traveled through the holes of the ships.</p><br/><p>Soon, a pair of a man and a woman was seen around a blue jade.</p><br/><p>Sadly, neither looked well.</p><br/><p>\\\"Uhk\u2026 Kuhuk.\\\"</p><br/><p>Taehee was throwing up blood and Sangjin was barely holding onto his soul.</p><br/><p>Looking at the fragments of two souls embedded in Sangjin's body, and the blue jade that Sangjin had his hand on, Hansoo could roughly calculate how the situation was going.</p><br/><p>'This\u2026 saved my soul.'</p><br/><p>Inside his body, it was Nurmaha's soul shard, which had become the seed of his soul, was pounding whenever the blue jade beat.</p><br/><p>Although it was getting weaker little by little, his shard and the blue jade was clearly connected.</p><br/><p>\\\"... You've worked hard,\\\" Hansoo, who had been silent for some time while watching the bloody two, muttered to the surrounding Neropa.</p><br/><p>\\\"Retreat. I won't attack since I've already reached an agreement.\\\"</p><br/><p>\\\"...\\\"</p><br/><p>From Hansoo's words, Belphegor and the others slowly stepped back, holding their breaths with cold sweat all over their bodies.</p><br/><p>\\\"... I really thought I was going to die,\\\" Belphegor muttered with a frightened look.</p><br/><p>When the Savior was defeated, despite having a sense that they should leave now, Belphegor could not believe it.</p><br/><p>Their Savior was the Star of Transcendence.</p><br/><p>His strength was beyond description.</p><br/><p>If they were to fight with the aid and support of the Ark...</p><br/><p>His mouth ached to repeat.</p><br/><p>In the first place, he didn't even hear a crash, so Belphegor thought he was still a doll.</p><br/><p>But, if this guy came back to life\u2026 There was no way that they didn't fight.</p><br/><p>But, he knew the moment he saw him that the Savior had given up fighting the moment he saw this.</p><br/><p>Belphegor would never dare to call their Savior a coward.</p><br/><p>He was sure anyone would have done this.</p><br/><p>The ominous aura encircling his whole body. He was a literal artificial weapon designed for slaughter with that level of bloodlust and ferocious energy.</p><br/><p>While looking at the man in a trance, he felt his whole body being torn apart from the increased bloodlust on the opposite side.</p><br/><p>'Damn\u2026 For us to leave such a guy alone and depart...'</p><br/><p>Although he didn't want to fight at all, it was quite burdensome having such a complicated, bad relationship with him.</p><br/><p>However, what was most important was to vacate.</p><br/><p>Belphegor quickly moved and headed into the direction of the Savior.</p><br/><p>The moment everyone disappeared\u2026</p><br/><p>Flop!</p><br/><p>Taehee, who was barely holding on, fell onto the floor, and Hansoo knelt down in front of her.</p><br/><p>Wooooooooooong.</p><br/><p>The energy that stretched out from the inside of Hansoo gently enveloped Taehee and Sangjin's body.</p><br/><p>Their mana, which had reached the bottom, were slowly springing up as their body began to steadily regenerate.</p><br/><p>Unlike Taehee who was slowly beginning to breathe with his energy, Sangjin remained in the same position as he was sitting on the floor.</p><br/><p>Hansoo, who raised his hand and straightened Sangjin, asked Taehee, \\\"... Is recovery impossible?\\\"</p><br/><p>Seeing Hansoo with a troubled look, Taehee briefly spoke out, \\\"Why do you ask? You can see he's a complete wreck.\\\"</p><br/><p>\\\"...\\\"</p><br/><p>From Taehee's words, Hansoo looked silently at Sangjin.</p><br/><p>To be exact, he stared into Sangjin's soul located inside. </p><br/><p>After accepting the soul of Neropa as a human, he used the fragments of Taehee's soul to invoke the Jade in an expedient manner.</p><br/><p>Blue Jade.</p><br/><p>As if to prove that it was an object, he paid the right price for the user that invoked it in an unjustifiable way.</p><br/><p>A cracked soul.</p><br/><p>'... If I ask Noah, could he bring him back?\\\"</p><br/><p>If the blue jade had the power to make a soul whole, he might be able to revive the soul of Sangjin.</p><br/><p>However, Hansoo who looked at it for a while, clenched his fist.</p><br/><p>Impossible.</p><br/><p>He knew the moment he saw that the Blue Jade ensured that the soul of the arrogant man who dared treat it in such a rude way would never have his soul undone.</p><br/><p>There was no way to fix the cracks of that soul.</p><br/><p>Taehee, who looked at Hansoo and Sangjin alternatively, replied again.</p><br/><p>\\\"I could wake him up for a minute, so say your final words.</p><br/><p>As soon as Taehee finished talking, she focused on her mind.</p><br/><p>Woooooooooooooooooong.</p><br/><p>Taehee's soul, which was located in the middle of Sangjin's body, was tying up the cracks in Sangjin's soul.</p><br/><p>At the same time\u2026</p><br/><p>\\\"I told you that you would see me again, right?\\\"</p><br/><p>Sangjin opened his eyes, smiling at Hansoo with a quiet chuckle.</p><br/><p>\\\"Why did you\u2026\\\"</p><br/><p>Sangjin smiled from his remark.</p><br/><p>\\\"I'm not sure. I didn't know that I would go this far.\\\"</p><br/><p>The beginning was quite vague.</p><br/><p>He didn't understand where the end was or what it would potentially look like.</p><br/><p>He just silently followed Hansoo without any knowledge or notion of what he should do or could do.</p><br/><p>The picture became clearer as he moved on, but he still didn't know how big the picture was.</p><br/><p>Then, he missed Hansoo that was walking in front of him.</p><br/><p>It was the first time that embarrassment and despair had struck him.</p><br/><p>However, the situation did not wait for Hansoo, and he was forced to take a step forward to make the way for the one who led him. </p><br/><p>'It was then that he saw.'</p><br/><p>Surprisingly, as Hansoo emerged from behind and stood forward, a big picture was slowly being drawn.</p><br/><p>Things that he could not see when he had followed silently from behind.</p><br/><p>The things that he could do, and the things that he needed to do\u2026 and what would happen if he didn't.</p><br/><p>\\\"We won\u2026 right? Did we win?\\\"</p><br/><p>He asked Hansoo in a voice that was gradually decreasing in tone and volume.</p><br/><p>\\\"Without me\u2026 You wouldn't have won, right?\\\"</p><br/><p>\\\"... Yes.\\\"</p><br/><p>Sangjin spoke with a grin at Hansoo's words.</p><br/><p>\\\"Look. That's how it's supposed to be\u2026 right?\\\"</p><br/><p>In a fate that would not have been strange if he had died on the first day of the Tutorial, they had reached this far.</p><br/><p>\\\"With this much\u2026 I was quite okay.\\\"</p><br/><p>With those final words, Sangjin closed his eyes quietly with a smile.</p><br/><p>Hansoo, who quietly put Sangjin down, slowly rose from his seat.</p><br/><p>'If you do this\u2026 It's too much of a loss.'</p><br/><p>Crack!</p><br/><p>The ground beneath Hansoo's feet began to rumble and crumble.</p><br/><p>---------------------------------------</p><br/><p>\\\"Preparing for a dimension leap. All in place.\\\"</p><br/><p>\\\"I'm glad that I was able to talk through him,\\\" Noah muttered as he watched his kind busily move.</p><br/><p>It was then\u2026</p><br/><p>Booooooooooooooom!</p><br/><p>\\\"...!\\\"</p><br/><p>Noah paused at the eerie momentum that resonated from the side of the Blue Sunlight Jade.</p><br/><p>Then, from within Noah\u2026</p><br/><p>Clementine, whose soul was now vanishing, squeezed all of his strength and belittled him.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

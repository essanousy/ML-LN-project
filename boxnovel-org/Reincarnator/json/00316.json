Either way, the injuries of those who\u2019d been held hostage in the War Fortress were too severe.</p><br/><p>These people had been wounded from the collision between the mysterious man and the Dark King.</p><br/><p>Even now, there were people still being rescued from the rubble and debris within the War Fortress.</p><br/><p>Thankfully, there were quite a lot of survivors due to their individual fortitude.</p><br/><p>Though their conditions weren\u2019t the best, they would heal quickly after a brief respite.</p><br/><p>\u2018...those two can\u2019t even be considered human anymore.\u2019</p><br/><p>Akran frowned as he looked at this scene.</p><br/><p>A brief collision had caused all this.</p><br/><p>Though there was a reason to hate the man who had caused this, Akran did not.</p><br/><p>Since the Dark King\u2019s tyranny would\u2019ve continued without that man.</p><br/><p>In the end, the mysterious man hadn\u2019t been at fault.</p><br/><p>It was all because of the Dark King; he\u2019s the one that should be cursed.</p><br/><p>\u2018...wait. Maybe he really did get cursed?\u2019</p><br/><p>UAAAAAAHH!</p><br/><p>Akran shuddered as he heard the screams of the Dark King in the distance.</p><br/><p>In all honesty, the reason why everyone had been able to take a breather and heal up their injuries so soon was because of the Dark King.</p><br/><p>They would\u2019ve had to set up a defensive perimeter and keep watch in case of more attacks, but the Dark King had been dealing with all of that for now.</p><br/><p>For some reason, the Dark King was going around massacring every abyssal beast in the nearby area.</p><br/><p>Not even taking the crystals that dropped from the beasts.</p><br/><p>\u2018Crystals\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>With a grim expression, Akran looked to the group of three sitting by a fire in the distance.</p><br/><p>Taesang, Misun, and Lauren Bell.</p><br/><p>The mysterious man had turned the Dark King like that, and had just simply left.</p><br/><p>Which meant that there was nobody here that could handle Taesang.</p><br/><p>But what the man had said to Taesang before he left was weighing on Akran\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>\u2018What did they talk about at the end\u2026?\u2019</p><br/><p>Akran stared at Taesang with a heavy expression.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>Taesang and his comrades were sitting by a fire.</p><br/><p>Though they wouldn\u2019t feel the cold with their current grade of strength, this was the easiest way to get rid of the disgusting darkness.</p><br/><p>Darkness inspired fear in everyone; even the very strong feared the darkness.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, this brings back memories.\u2019</p><br/><p>As she looked at Taesang, Misun thought back to her days back on earth when she\u2019d gone camping with her friends. He was busy chewing on a piece of monster meat that they\u2019d roasted over the fire.</p><br/><p>He seemed to be having a lot of different thoughts.</p><br/><p>Chewing on a piece of meat, Misun carefully asked Taesang:</p><br/><p>\u201cSo...did that man just leave? He didn\u2019t want anything from us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Taesang had been the only one who had talked to the man before he left.</p><br/><p>Since the man just disappeared after making the Dark King act like that.</p><br/><p>Taesang looked at Misun, and then quietly nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, he just left.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...Does he really not want anything from us? We should still be quite useful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Though becoming an underling wasn\u2019t great in any sense, the fact that such a powerful being had left them behind...</p><br/><p>Taesang smiled bitterly as he replied:</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you really think that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...\u201d</p><br/><p>Misun was at a loss for words.</p><br/><p>In all honesty, she didn\u2019t really want to ask about Hansoo.</p><br/><p>What could they do for him in a fight between transcendents?</p><br/><p>Misun then looked at Taesang again.</p><br/><p>\u2018...What\u2019s going to happen with you now, Taesang?\u2019</p><br/><p>Taesang\u2019s eyes had been glued to the crystals on the ground for a while now.</p><br/><p>The countless crystals that the Dark King had left behind.</p><br/><p>Misun frowned at this.</p><br/><p>Seeing Taesang devouring all those crystals kept bothering her.</p><br/><p>As well as his strength that was now vastly superior than average.</p><br/><p>Maybe\u2026</p><br/><p>Maybe this was the last chance for him to become a transcendent.</p><br/><p>A monster who was about to take flight.</p><br/><p>But unlike Misun\u2019s worries, Taesang was having different thoughts.</p><br/><p>Thoughts about the conversation he had with the man about the crystals.</p><br/><p>\u2018...A stupid question, really.\u2019</p><br/><p>Taesang smiled bitterly.</p><br/><p>He was still embarrassed about what he\u2019d asked.</p><br/><p>Taesang had stared at Hansoo with anticipation.</p><br/><p>If he followed what the Dark King did, then he would obviously end up like him.</p><br/><p>But what if he ate the crystals and used his power righteously?</p><br/><p>He was embarrassed because this question had shown the man the greed that was burning inside him, yet he was still curious.</p><br/><p>But the man looked towards the west and only said one thing.</p><br/><p>Then the man disappeared towards the west.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ugh\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Taesang laughed at himself as he thought back to that moment.</p><br/><p>His expression had been extremely hopeful back then.</p><br/><p>He felt like he had been accepted by the man.</p><br/><p>He thought that he had received the rights to all the crystals.</p><br/><p>Since devouring the crystals was the better option for him instead of letting everyone use it to climb up.</p><br/><p>But after thinking for a while, he came to a different conclusion.</p><br/><p>Taesang finished his thoughts and got up.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><br/><p>Taesang smiled as he pointed towards the crystals.</p><br/><p>\u201cGotta pick those up, right? Can\u2019t leave them rolling around like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Though Taesang had said it cheerfully, the expression of the others froze.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026what are you going to do with them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Taesang smiled bitterly at Lauren\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>\u2018Everyone fears me already\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t what he wanted.</p><br/><p>He wanted to become strong.</p><br/><p>But he didn\u2019t want to be distanced from those who loved him, and whom he loved in return.</p><br/><p>But he\u2019d come to a realization.</p><br/><p>That if you didn\u2019t look around yourself in your charge towards the top, there would be no one left once you looked down from the peak.</p><br/><p>\u2018Maybe that\u2019s why all the transcendents act alone.\u2019</p><br/><p>Even if they wanted to be with other people, or wish to protect their loved ones, all their relationships would eventually end up so twisted.</p><br/><p>And he didn\u2019t want to become like that.</p><br/><p>Thankfully, there was still a chance for him.</p><br/><p>Taesang looked at the three, and spoke carefully.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019ll need to talk to everyone about that. After we replenish the amount of crystals I ate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Whether they decided that he should eat them to protect them, or to use them to go up, he would agree to the wants of the others.</p><br/><p>Maybe they might try to raise another transcendent.</p><br/><p>No matter what, they still needed a lot of crystals.</p><br/><p>It would take a long time, but it wouldn\u2019t matter.</p><br/><p>\u2018...This is the right path, right?\u2019</p><br/><p>Taesang mumbled, thinking of the man who had left.</p><br/><p>Though he might become greedy, since he was a human as well.</p><br/><p>UAAAAAAAHH!</p><br/><p>The Dark King in the distance would help steel his mind from straying to that path.</p><br/><p>Since that man could return at any moment.</p><br/><p>Maybe even stronger than before.</p><br/><p>Taesang then looked towards the west.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014</p><br/><p>Surprisingly, Hansoo hadn\u2019t gone far.</p><br/><p>He had something he needed to do.</p><br/><p>\u2018...They took the flail, huh?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo thought to himself, after visiting the center of the War Fortress before he left for the west.</p><br/><p>He searched around a bit in case the Dark King had hidden it, but couldn\u2019t find it in the end.</p><br/><p>It was probably now in someone else\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>Though a normal person would be burnt to a crisp once they touched the flail that was located on the mana node, there were existences that could safely grasp it.</p><br/><p>Since he had made it possible.</p><br/><p>\u2018It was probably one of the transcendents.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo decided to forget about the flail for now.</p><br/><p>Since there was no reason to find it nor was there a method for him to track it down.</p><br/><p>There was something else he had to deal with at this moment.</p><br/><p>\u2018We\u2019ve arrived.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014</p><br/><p>Hansoo stopped to look at the castle in front of him.</p><br/><p>It was the Keil Kingdom\u2019s refugee fortress, where Taesang, Misun, and the other refugees had previously lived.</p><br/><p>The attack of the Kang-Kions had turned it into ruins, but he had a reason for his return.</p><br/><p>\u2018...It\u2019s getting on my mind.\u2019</p><br/><p>As to why the abyssal beasts, who went everywhere the humans could be found, had not tried to approach this area.</p><br/><p>Even before the Kang-Kions attacked, a lot of them had hesitated.</p><br/><p>Which meant that there was something deterring them in this place.</p><br/><p>If that wasn\u2019t the case, then even more Kang-Kions would\u2019ve attacked, which would have resulted in even more casualties.</p><br/><p>\u2018I must check.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014boom!\u2014</p><br/><p>Hansoo rose high up into the sky and headed towards the center of the fortress.</p><br/><p>\u2014chijijijik!\u2014</p><br/><p>He gathered a tremendous amount of energy around his spear.</p><br/><p>The Nine Dragons Spear.</p><br/><p>\u2014sssss\u2014</p><br/><p>Six dragons converged almost instantly and crept to the tip of his spear.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014BOOOOOM!\u2014</p><br/><p>The dark orb that Hansoo created smashed into the ground of the fortress and made a huge noise.</p><br/><p>\u2014rummmblee\u2014</p><br/><p>A single strike was all that needed to break down the fortress that had barely held on after the attack of the Kang-Kions.</p><br/><p>But its collapse wasn\u2019t entirely due to Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u2018Cave?\u2019</p><br/><p>There was a giant cave right beneath the fortress.</p><br/><p>Kyaaaaak!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, something that had been sitting below popped out, rising into the air.</p><br/><p>A snake-like creature that seemed to have been created from a convergence of darkness.</p><br/><p>\u2018An Evil Suction Beast.\u2019</p><br/><p>They were a solitary-type race.</p><br/><p>If one didn\u2019t know how to deal with them, then it was a grade 6.</p><br/><p>If one knew how to, then it would only be at grade 4.</p><br/><p>A race that sucked energy out of beings to empower themselves and to reproduce.</p><br/><p>The reason why the cave could not be sensed was because the bodies of these things had been filling up the entirety of the cave, leaving no gaps.</p><br/><p>\u2018...For them to be living right on top of these guys and still survive....they were really lucky.\u2019</p><br/><p>But soon Hansoo realized that it hadn\u2019t been entirely due to luck.</p><br/><p>These things had been sitting underground without coming up because they hadn\u2019t finished eating.</p><br/><p>As the dark snakes moved out, he could see what they had been eating.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Jang Oh?

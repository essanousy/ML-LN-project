We gave the Juicers to Yohan\u2019s guys earlier and gave them basic explanations as well. They\u2019ll be fine from now on.\u201d</p><br/><p>The most busy time for them, the clans, was now.</p><br/><p>When the people of the tutorial come in, they had to give them basic notices and then spread out again.</p><br/><p>And they needed to gather the basic information of every newcomer every year and organize it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow are the standards for the guys this time around?\u201d</p><br/><p>His comrade, who had been standing next to him, shrugged his shoulders at those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know how it is. That it increases a bit every year.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThem fairies. They\u2019re only thorough in things like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man clicked his tongue.</p><br/><p>The fairies set up the tutorial so that the people would survive even if they were dropped in the End Root here.</p><br/><p>And because of that the standards of those who go through the Tutorial increase every year.</p><br/><p>The reason was very simple.</p><br/><p>Since the environment of the End Root gets harsher as time goes on.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tsk. The number of survivors would increase greatly if the Calamity Fish didn\u2019t exist.\u2019</p><br/><p>The location of where the newcomers drop is becoming closer towards the center of the World Tree since those guys keep gnawing down the tree roots.</p><br/><p>If you take into account the fact that the level of the beasts increases the closer one gets to the giant World Tree it means that the difficulty of where newcomers land after the tutorial increases every year.</p><br/><p>And since they needed to set the standards of the newcomers to fit that, the difficulty of the tutorial increased and the survival rate decreased.</p><br/><p>\u2018You need to stay on the boat longer as well.\u2019</p><br/><p>If that thing disappeared then an amazing number of people out of those who are dragged here would be saved.</p><br/><p>Since the roots will grow back and the difficulty of the tutorial will get lowered to fit that.</p><br/><p>It is said that the survival rate of the 1st tutorial was 55%, which was much higher than now, when there were a lot of tree roots left.</p><br/><p>\u201814% of the people had survived last year but it\u2019s only about 11% this year\u2026 about 3 billion more would come over but for the survival rate to be like this\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>The amount that had crossed over the past 20 years was about 3.5 billion.</p><br/><p>But the speed at which they were coming was increasing at a very rapid rate.</p><br/><p>As if something was pulling their world.</p><br/><p>Though the immediate survival rate had decreased the number of newcomers had increased.</p><br/><p>But at this rate, in about 5 to 6 years from now all of humanity would be dragged here and then all get massacred in the tutorial.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damnit.\u2019</p><br/><p>The helper clansman made a bitter expression.</p><br/><p>Since the chances of his family being part of those who would get massacred was very high.</p><br/><p>If the difficulty of the tutorial gets reset because the Calamity Fish disappeared and the Roots grow back then the number of people will increase greatly but sadly the Calamity Fish was not something humans could deal with.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well it seems like some strange guys are popping out due to the increased difficulty though.\u2019</p><br/><p>And the man stared at the guy standing in front of Camille Rowe in the distance.</p><br/><p>A guy who had fought back and forth against Camille Rowe despite being a newcomer.</p><br/><p>No, he didn\u2019t even fight back and forth.</p><br/><p>Since the newcomer seemed to be much more calm even to his eyes.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t have any skills or artifacts.</p><br/><p>But he was still at that level.</p><br/><p>The rumors of this guy will get spread very fast.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hmm. A scout might even come.\u2019</p><br/><p>The man who was standing atop of the cross mumbled inwardly as he looked at the guy walking towards him.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Camille laughed absentmindedly at Hansoo\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it, whatever. It wouldn\u2019t be bad to fail for the 14th time anyways.\u201d</p><br/><p>She was going to make the attempt anyway.</p><br/><p>What difference would it make to take this ambitious guy along with her.</p><br/><p>Hansoo opened his eyes wide at Camille Rowe\u2019s words and then looked at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you saying. About failing. There\u2019s no time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are definitely succeeding. If you failed about 13 times then it\u2019s about time to succeed once. You prepared to escape from it as well. Perfect.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. There\u2019s no time. There\u2019s 13 days and 18 hours left.\u201d</p><br/><p>If you take into account that thing\u2019s movement speed then it\u2019ll arrive around then.</p><br/><p>But that was basically the time limit.</p><br/><p>It was better to prepare as soon as possible and kill it off in the distant sea.</p><br/><p>Since the amount of casualties will explode upwards once that thing goes insane at the last moment.</p><br/><p>Hansoo got up from his seat as he finished his words.</p><br/><p>\u2018He\u2019s really confident to the point of damnation. He really makes one fall for him goddamnit.\u2019</p><br/><p>Camille clicked her tongue and asked as she looked at Hansoo\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do first?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo shrugged his shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to the Helper Clan first. I should at least visit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Since I need to receive the Juicer.\u2019</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t have any intel but the Juicer was a necessity in order to not starve to death.</p><br/><p>Camille remembered what she had forgotten about at those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Oh yeah, he was a beginner.\u2019</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t even think about that because his actions were so off.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well okay. I have some things to do as well.\u2019</p><br/><p>Camille got up from her seat and then walked towards the Helper Clansmen who were guarding the Cross.</p><br/><p>\u2018I really wish\u2026 I really wish my sibling hasn\u2019t come yet.\u2019</p><br/><p>But sadly, the chances increased as time went on.</p><br/><p>Since the number of people who had been coming here over the Tutorial had been increasing.</p><br/><p>At this pace then all of the remaining people on earth will transfer over to the Otherworld in about 5 to 6 years.</p><br/><p>That was the reason why the Seven Departed Souls and many others who had the qualifications to go up stayed at the Red zone to search around.</p><br/><p>In order to find their family or precious people who could come at any time.</p><br/><p>The reason why that Helper Clan was able to be maintained was very simple as well.</p><br/><p>It was something born from the combined minds of those who wanted to stop the random deaths of their family or close people.</p><br/><p>The Helper Clan was the place that the minds of those who didn\u2019t have the leisure to search for their family because of the harsh environment they\u2019re faced with but wanted to stop such things as death from happening supported.</p><br/><p>Since they might be able to meet each other as long they are alive.</p><br/><p>\u2018That person called Eres is amazing. How did she think of such a thing 20 years ago?\u2019</p><br/><p>Eres had gone up already but her clan had remained behind to keep accepting newcomers and were taking care of the newcomers constantly with the support of those in other Red Zones.</p><br/><p>Of course in the most basic ways only.</p><br/><p>Since nobody could take care of anything further than that.</p><br/><p>They helped with the most basic survival tactics and preparations but surviving after fighting against a beast or other people was all up to themselves.</p><br/><p>Camille greeted one of the Helper clansman after she arrived.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while. Can I check the catalogue? And take care of this newcomer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a VIP, of course. Let\u2019s see\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Then the clansman started to check the catalogue.</p><br/><p>Usually they would only give basic warnings and the Juicer.</p><br/><p>But for those who supported them a lot, there will be some more special services.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>If you give basic appearances or a name then the newcomers of the Helper Clansman spread about in thousands of End Roots will search the person asked by a VIP.</p><br/><p>A personed searched by a VVIP with a stronger backing will be checked to see if he was at the tutorial or not. (* PR Note: VVIP = Very Very Important Person?)</p><br/><p>The Helper Clansman who had been searching around the catalogue shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like they\u2019re here on this side of the Roots. Though we can\u2019t check up the tutorial with the amount you supported. I don\u2019t know about the other Roots but all the intel will be gathered within two days so come find us then.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man completed those words and then went upwards.</p><br/><p>With a few people behind him.</p><br/><p>And Camille knew the identities of those people.</p><br/><p>Those were the people who the VIP or the VVIP asked to find.</p><br/><p>\u201cHoooh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She had confirmed that they weren\u2019t here but this was vexing in itself.</p><br/><p>Since there was no way to know if they hadn\u2019t been dragged into the Otherworld or had died at the Tutorial.</p><br/><p>But Camille shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u2018Focus on the Calamity Fish.\u2019</p><br/><p>Finding her sibling was not something she could do anyway.</p><br/><p>Camille spoke to Hansoo who had gathered the Juicer and a few other things.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. Let\u2019s hear your plan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo spoke with a very serious expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery simple. You will guide me and take me inside there. Then I will shove the hidden card I have prepared into a fatal location within its body.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Shall I beat him up?\u2019</p><br/><p>Camille sighed, shook her head and then spoke.</p><br/><p>Well that was basically the basic summary of it.</p><br/><p>Since you couldn\u2019t kill it from the outside.</p><br/><p>Though the problem was that he extremely simplified the process.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell. Okay. There\u2019s a lot of things to be prepared. I\u2019ve prepared the boat already, though it\u2019s a 30 man boat.\u201d</p><br/><p>If that thing arrived at land and started to eat then there wouldn\u2019t even be time to get inside it.</p><br/><p>Since the heavens will be falling apart.</p><br/><p>You needed to quietly approach it while it was swimming quietly and then go inside its body.</p><br/><p>Well of course, quiet is relative to what it would be.</p><br/><p>Since huge tornadoes will be rushing around its body.</p><br/><p>Hansoo shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do with a 30 man boat. Let\u2019s go with mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve prepared a 500 man boat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! You crazy bastard\u2026 did you just leave that behind?\u201d</p><br/><p>Camille shouted in shock.</p><br/><p>Why would he have done such a thing when there are so many people who desired boats.</p><br/><p>Hansoo chuckled at those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ve hidden it well. Let\u2019s go to the next subject.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>While Camille was shaking her head, Hansoo checked the things Camille had prepared.</p><br/><p>The only reason why he had come to find Camille.</p><br/><p>Since she had already prepared the things which you could only gather at the Base Root or the Trunk.</p><br/><p>There were a lot of things needed to be prepared before going into its body but a lot of time could be saved with just this much.</p><br/><p>Camille smirked at that.</p><br/><p>\u2018What would you know even if you saw it.\u2019</p><br/><p>Those things were things which you couldn\u2019t even see during the tutorial stage.</p><br/><p>At that moment Hansoo looked at Camille and asked:</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you prepare Apon\u2019s Body Fluid? We need that.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was needed to create the which 127 Alchemists had researched and finally created with the information received from the Elvenheim he had met at the Abyss as the basis.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026.You know about that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026.Is he really a beginner?\u2019</p><br/><p>Being strong was being strong, it was a completely different problem from intel.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have a psychic power. Let\u2019s ignore trifling things. There\u2019s no time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo answered simply and then started to go over the material thoroughly again.</p><br/><p>Camille looked at that Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026Does he have a trait like a Library?\u2019</p><br/><p>Trait. .</p><br/><p>It supplied information about the things one didn\u2019t know and once the level increases it will give basic information regarding what to do.</p><br/><p>\u2018I thought he would have a battle-related trait\u2026 but for it to be the Library.\u2019</p><br/><p>She had thought that it was a battle-related trait because he was such a strong guy but the Library was a bit out of expectation.</p><br/><p>\u2018Perhaps he has two traits?\u2019</p><br/><p>That might be possible since he hides so many things.</p><br/><p>While Camille was thinking of this and that while looking at Hansoo, Hansoo, who had finished checking Camille\u2019s preparations, laid down a decision.</p><br/><p>\u2018We should spread out and search in order to save time.\u2019</p><br/><p>Camille had prepared quite well but this was not enough.</p><br/><p>\u2018The first thing we need to make is the .</p><br/><p>A liquid which the alchemists had researched in order to give a fatal wound after getting inside the Calamity Fish.</p><br/><p>Other things might not be needed but this was a necessity.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s separate and move. Since there are a lot of things we need to get.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo spoke out the things needed to Camille.</p><br/><p>Materials which Hansoo didn\u2019t know where they were but Camille Rowe, who had roamed around the Roots for 3 years, would definitely know.</p><br/><p>Camille would definitely get them in time.</p><br/><p>For the things which would be hard with Camille\u2019s level to get, he had to go.</p><br/><p>While Hansoo was making plans for the future, Camille nodded after checking the list that Hansoo had told her.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s clear this is a guy that has got something.\u2019 (*PR: he\u2019s not just saying nonsense)</p><br/><p>The 17 things he had told her were things she didn\u2019t prepare because she wasn\u2019t sure but were things that she had thought that might work at one point.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ll trust him once.\u2019</p><br/><p>Camille, who had finished her thoughts, quickly separated from Hansoo and started to head towards a different direction from him.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u2018Though it\u2019s a bit tight\u2026 I can get them all if there are no problems along the way.\u2019</p><br/><p>The only problem was the distance she had to travel and the many types of materials she had to collect. She knew the location of all 17 materials and it wasn\u2019t hard for a 3rd year as herself because most of them were from beasts at the End Root.</p><br/><p>While Camille was jumping with light movements a loud voice was heard from some place.</p><br/><p>\u201cEyy. Camille. Your body is still amazing. It\u2019ll really burst at that rate. There\u2019s really a huge difference between westerners and easterners.\u201d</p><br/><p>She then turned her head towards the direction of the voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cKang Gyesoo\u2026 you bastard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWoah woah. Don\u2019t glare at me like that. We have a rather unique relationship between us. We\u2019ve gone in and come out from within the Calamity Fish together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I shouldn\u2019t have taken in a bastard like you on the second attempt.\u201d</p><br/><p>For someone who had barely held onto his life and come out from within the Calamity fish to become a Quadratus.</p><br/><p>Camille grinded her teeth.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m still using the relic I got from within the stomach very well. Kuhuu. I thank you. Since it\u2019s all thanks to you. I\u2019ve reached quite a high place thanks to that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gyesoo then proceeded to swing around the sword on his hand.</p><br/><p>A weird skill was applied onto the sword where the air which the sword had passed through shook.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Are you going to disturb me again?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Camille grinded her teeth Gyesoo laughed loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cUwahahahaha! What kind of misunderstanding do you have. If we really disturbed you seriously then you think you can even attempt at the Calamity Fish? If we did it properly then you would\u2019ve died already. We just kept you alive because of old friendship.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Camille was flustered Gyesoo giggled as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cDisturbing you is more like\u2026 well we are followers so we just touched you a few times because we couldn\u2019t leave somebody who tried to kill our god alone. But shouldn\u2019t it be time for you to accept it? That is basically an agent of god. You\u2019ve seen it too. The insides of the Calamity Fish.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOthers don\u2019t know but you and I know about it. I don\u2019t understand why somebody who had seen something like that wouldn\u2019t come into our Quadratus.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026So are you here to ask me to join your Quadratus again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gyesoo shook his head at those words</p><br/><p>\u201cNope. We aren\u2019t really interested anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it a bit shameless to ask for attention after 13 failures? It\u2019s not even fun anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m here because I have some business with that newcomer. Was he called Kang Hansoo?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Camille\u2019s expressions froze, Gyesoo shook his hands as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cWoah. Don\u2019t glare at me like that. It\u2019s not a bad proposition on his terms either. You see, a scout has come in from above.\u201d</p><br/><p>Camille looked at Gyesoo with a slight frown at those words.</p><br/><p>Proofreader\u2019s note</p><br/><p>This is regular chapter 2/3. Regular chapters are on Wednesday, Friday and Sunday. Tomorrow is probably going to be Ekdud\u2019s rest day of the week.</p><br/><p>To clarify about the skill Reinforcement: There are various different Reinforcement skills. Each reinforces in its own way, and it\u2019s more or less efficient. Each also amplifies the user\u2019s stats with its own rate. And finally each has a special skill that can be triggered.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

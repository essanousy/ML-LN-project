Well, shall we call what we have a contract, like how you guys call it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jang Oh made a bitter expression at the condescending words of Tiamet.</p><br/><p>\u2018I know. That\u2019s why you treat us this way.\u2019</p><br/><p>Horrible living conditions.</p><br/><p>This special area that was created near the extravagant capital always told them.</p><br/><p>That they should be thankful to at least be treated this way before going up.</p><br/><p>His friend, Clementine, tried very hard for their survival.</p><br/><p>But was the life given to them satisfactory? That was a different story.</p><br/><p>Reality was harsh.</p><br/><p>Especially in this damned world created by \u2018God\u2019.</p><br/><p>Tiamet spoke towards Jang Oh.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been nice to you so far. We\u2019ve protected you from the players and kept you alive but\u2026 I don\u2019t like to keep things that are undeeded.\u201d</p><br/><p>He and the natives of the Kingdoms and the Empire had a hard time going into the Spirit Land.</p><br/><p>Since for them the Ain\u2019s Blessing was an impossibility and the Protection Elixirs were not working.</p><br/><p>This is why he had kept these guys alive.</p><br/><p>These parasites that passed by his world momentarily.</p><br/><p>But if they didn\u2019t do their job, there was no need to keep them.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll solve this problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tiamet laughed towards Jang Oh who surrounded himself in bits of shadows as if he was about to move out.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake them all. Everybody who\u2019s just sitting around and eating.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jang Oh\u2019s expression froze.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you trust me? I\u2019m more than enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>These weren\u2019t empty words.</p><br/><p>He had been doing well by himself.</p><br/><p>And though he heard that the new guy was strong, he had confidence in winning.</p><br/><p>Since he had seen the other\u2019s skills over the hole.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Whoooosh!</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhuk\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jang Oh groaned at the powerful hand grabbing onto his throat.</p><br/><p>And Tiamet, the owner of this hand, slowly tightened his grip as he spoke with a cold expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you to do it properly you fucking scrub. Don\u2019t you understand? It seems you don\u2019t want to take them because it\u2019s dangerous but\u2026 Know this. If you fail then you guys don\u2019t have any value left. If you still have a brain then you should know what is better, all of you dying versus just a few.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop him no matter what. From going over the mountain range. Don\u2019t let a single person cross it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Smash!</p><br/><p>\u2018Mudusella. Things won\u2019t go the way you want.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tiamet mumbled after he threw Jang Oh on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>Rummmmble.</p><br/><p>Hansoo continued to drop as he got hit by the avalanche that fell from above.</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>He heard something from below.</p><br/><p>The sound of the black marble created from the Nine Dragons Spear smashing against something.</p><br/><p>It had succeeded in melting the snow but something was blocking the energy.</p><br/><p>Hansoo focused his sight as he fell.</p><br/><p>Soon.</p><br/><p>Through the mist that had been created from the ice and snow melting, he could see some blackish things.</p><br/><p>A steel wall that had been half destroyed by the Nine Dragons Spear.</p><br/><p>No, it shouldn\u2019t be steel.</p><br/><p>Steel wouldn\u2019t be able to withstand the Nine Dragons Spear.</p><br/><p>Some sort of alloy.</p><br/><p>Despite it being half smashed apart, he could still see faint traces of light running through it.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo could somewhat guess what this was.</p><br/><p>\u2018This looks similar to the things from the Golden Dragon Formation...Why is this here. Hmm\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>The wall of the Azure Dragon\u2019s Seat that was surrounded from the mana node\u2019s energy.</p><br/><p>The feeling of the metal and the energy that was emitted from it were similar to it.</p><br/><p>\u2018Jang Oh told me he went through the entrance. Hmm.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo thought of the words of Jang Oh from the past but merely shook his head and then raised his spear.</p><br/><p>And used his falling momentum to smash into the wall.</p><br/><p>Boooooooooooom!</p><br/><p>\u2018Not bad?\u2019</p><br/><p>Despite it being half destroyed already, the wall did a good job of withstanding Hansoo\u2019s attack.</p><br/><p>The issue wasn\u2019t the material but rather the energy flowing through it.</p><br/><p>The wall that was about a meter thick started to heal itself with the energy flowing through it.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhhh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastard! This isn\u2019t anywhere close enough to kill us!\u201d</p><br/><p>The voices of the players from above could be heard.</p><br/><p>This was within expectations.</p><br/><p>Though they got pushed away from the avalanche, this wasn\u2019t enough to kill them.</p><br/><p>It was just to push them away and buy some time.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hmph. It\u2019ll be annoying if you chase.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked at the hole that was too small for him to go through and nodded.</p><br/><p>Then his mana was sucked into the Nurmaha\u2019s ring.</p><br/><p>Kiiiing!</p><br/><p>Hansoo saw the shining ring on his finger and then smashed the ring into the alloy wall.</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>The wall still stood but there was a difference this time.</p><br/><p>Whooosh!</p><br/><p>The Power Nullification of the ring erased about a two-meters-radius\u2019s worth of energy from the wall.</p><br/><p>This wouldn\u2019t last long since the wave of energy was flowing back into this area.</p><br/><p>But this was enough.</p><br/><p>Hansoo smashed his spear down onto the wall again.</p><br/><p>Crunch!</p><br/><p>Without the protection of the mysterious energy, the wall could not withstand Hansoo\u2019s attack from just the toughness of the alloy.</p><br/><p>A hole about Hansoo\u2019s size was created and Hansoo jumped through the wall.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Hey you bastard! You\u2019re running?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHold him down!\u201d</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>Booom!</p><br/><p>The players ran towards the hole Hansoo disappeared through.</p><br/><p>But it was too late.</p><br/><p>Shhhshshshh!</p><br/><p>\u201cUh!? What the. This thing is shrinking!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Power Nullification had long worn out because of the waves of energy that rushed back in.</p><br/><p>The hole in the alloy wall that was barely enough for Hansoo to get through was already getting smaller.</p><br/><p>\u201cFucking hell!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn!\u201d</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>The players attacked the shrinking hole in panic but it was useless.</p><br/><p>The energy flowing through the wall was too powerful for them to break through.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat in the\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell is hidden here? Jesus\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Some people sat down and gave up but some still held on.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet back up and try looking around! There might be an entrance somewhere! Even a castle has doors!\u201d</p><br/><p>Some of the players heard this and nodded.</p><br/><p>And then started to slowly use their skills to search around.</p><br/><p>Chiiiiiiiiiik.</p><br/><p>Despite the tremendous amount of ice, which had accumulated and condensed over tens of thousands of years, it could not withstand the combined heat from the skills of thouasnds of players.</p><br/><p>And as they started their search, a question surfaced into their heads.</p><br/><p>\u2018What is this?\u2019</p><br/><p>The players made confused expressions.</p><br/><p>The game, Exodus, was set in medieval times.</p><br/><p>Building up walls with stones and the royalty fighting with swords and spears.</p><br/><p>Though these stones and weapons were far beyond normal ones because of magic but the level of science was indeed very low.</p><br/><p>An alloy like this, which should only exist in some Sci-Fi movies, should not be present here.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is this for some major update...Or something?\u2019</p><br/><p>The players came up with the most befitting answer.</p><br/><p>Why else would something like this exist below layers of ice thousands of kilometers away from civilization?</p><br/><p>At this moment the eyes of the players changed.</p><br/><p>Curiosity started to replace the rage inside them.</p><br/><p>And the speed of them melting the ice sped up from this.</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh?\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the players exclaimed out loud while he was melting the ice and proceeding in a twisted path.</p><br/><p>Though it was very muted, it could not stay undetected from the focused perceptions of the other players.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you find something?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEntrance? Did you find the entrance?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everybody started to rush towards where the voice came from.</p><br/><p>But then the one who made the noise shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo...It\u2019s not the entrance but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The eyes of the players naturally looked towards where the man was looking at.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t an entrance there but a strange letter.</p><br/><p>[A\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u2018What the hell is this now\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>It was so large that despite the player having melted a 30m radius, only a single letter could be seen.</p><br/><p>And the players who had gotten curious decided what to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cShall we\u2026 Try digging it out carefully?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSome should provide support with skills so things don\u2019t fall on our heads and the others should melt it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone nodded as they spread out.</p><br/><p>Chiiiiiiik.</p><br/><p>Chiik.</p><br/><p>They dug around it like an ant\u2019s nest in fear of things collapsing but in order to excavate everything, they would need to clear an area several times larger than a football field.</p><br/><p>So everyone carefully enlarged the area while making sure things didn\u2019t fall.</p><br/><p>They were still master level players and were the most powerful out of those.</p><br/><p>The ice melted away very quickly and soon an underground cave was created.</p><br/><p>Of a size that could allow thousands of people to live.</p><br/><p>And then they read what the letters said.</p><br/><p>[ASTRO-17]</p><br/><p>\u2018...What is this.\u2019</p><br/><p>An english word that symbolized space.</p><br/><p>Though they knew what it meant, it didn't belong here.</p><br/><p>The game\u2019s main concept was unveiling the unknown while traveling through the lands, something like this didn\u2019t fit the game at all.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Whoooosh!</p><br/><p>The moment Hansoo penetrated through the wall.</p><br/><p>He thought that a tunnel or a small space would appear after going through the 1m thick wall.</p><br/><p>But things were completely out of his expectations.</p><br/><p>\u201c...Amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Whoosh!</p><br/><p>Hansoo mumbled as he fell towards the ground far below.</p><br/><p>A cylindrical space that was several kilometers wide and tall.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo was shocked as he saw the giant world that spread out below his feet inside this space.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

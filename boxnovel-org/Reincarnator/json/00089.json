You got rotten after 20 years of peace.\u2019</p><br/><p>He never expected that this guy would act like such a coward.</p><br/><p>A person who had been acting like a King of the Red Zone for 20 years.</p><br/><p>And the skills to match that.</p><br/><p>He had thought that Miyamoto would show a look befitting that, and in fact didn\u2019t gain much harm from fighting the Ouroboros, but for him to go this far.</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s expression turned cold.</p><br/><p>\u2018Clean it up.\u2019</p><br/><p>At this rate it was more of a disturbance than help.</p><br/><p>But he had to save Sof\u00eda first.</p><br/><p>Hansoo stepped off the marbles at an extreme speed and then caught Sof\u00eda.</p><br/><p>He then hugged her and then raised his mana reinforcement to the limit.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s too late to dodge!\u2019</p><br/><p>And the giant body of the Ouroboros smashed into them like a whip.</p><br/><p>Booom!</p><br/><p>\u2018Kuhuk!\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo clenched his teeth at the force which made his whole body feel like it was getting smashed.</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s body, which had been hit like a baseball being hit by a bat, started to rush towards the ground at an extreme speed.</p><br/><p>Hoooong</p><br/><p>Ekidrang\u2019s marble rushed towards Hansoo very quickly.</p><br/><p>Kigigigik</p><br/><p>Hansoo used those marbles to reduce his speed in air and tried to catch his balance in air.</p><br/><p>Since he will receive even more damage if he were to crash onto the ground like this.</p><br/><p>At that moment the unconscious Sof\u00eda opened her eyes in Hansoo\u2019s embrace.</p><br/><p>And then laughed while looking at Hansoo hugging him.</p><br/><p>With a completely different eye than before.</p><br/><p>Kiiiing</p><br/><p>Sof\u00eda started up the again under Miyamoto\u2019s orders.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gullible bastard.\u2019</p><br/><p>It might be different from afar but if she were to attack from this distance then it\u2019ll end just like that.</p><br/><p>And even more so if he had been hit by the Ouroboros.</p><br/><p>But the moment Miyamoto tried to laugh with Sof\u00eda\u2019s face, a hand grasped Sof\u00eda\u2019s wrist.</p><br/><p>Kiiing</p><br/><p>And because of this the jade-colored marble that was being made inside Sof\u00eda\u2019s hand disappeared before it could even activate.</p><br/><p>Miyamoto, who was controlling Sof\u00eda from the distance, spat out a sound at unconsciously at the sudden unexpected event.</p><br/><p>\u201cUk?\u201d</p><br/><p>Miyamoto quickly tried to look at Hansoo but the sight of Sof\u00eda he was controlling started to quickly fade away.</p><br/><p>\u2018What\u2026 What just happened\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Miyamoto made a flustered face after being disconnected.</p><br/><p>At the same time a chill ran down his back.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026No way.\u2019</p><br/><p>The reason why he had acted so drastically was in large part because he wasn\u2019t worried about getting caught.</p><br/><p>Since he just could just blame it on Sof\u00eda.</p><br/><p>How would Hansoo know that it was his doing?</p><br/><p>But the danger he felt run down his back told him.</p><br/><p>There was no way that a threatening feeling from the Ouroboros would come at this time.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ve been caught.\u2019</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know how he found out or what the evidence was.</p><br/><p>But the important fact was that Hansoo was now targeting him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damnit. What do I do. What do I do\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>It felt like Hansoo would come rushing up from below at any moment.</p><br/><p>He thought of controlling the other five Departed Souls and having a go at it but then he would need to get in danger.</p><br/><p>Miyamoto made his decision in a short moment.</p><br/><p>\u2018Run away. Then look for a chance from the distance.\u2019</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no way that this crazy guy will slash down the sinless six Departed Souls.</p><br/><p>He just needed to hide deep within the World Tree and then wait until everything finishes.</p><br/><p>If he were to hide in this vast World Tree Mountain Range then how would that guy find him?</p><br/><p>If that guy was planning to kill the Wasp Legion then he would be able to look for another chance with the Departed Souls.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damnit. This is miserable.\u2019</p><br/><p>But Miyamoto\u2019s theory was the same as always.</p><br/><p>The one surviving is the stronger one.</p><br/><p>Miyamoto pulled out his final card, the feather.</p><br/><p>Not a fragment but a whole leaf.</p><br/><p>He would be able to go anywhere with this.</p><br/><p>Crumple</p><br/><p>Soon Miyamoto\u2019s body got covered with a bright light and started to disappear.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u2018Huh.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo swirled his tongue around at the guy who used the feather when he merely just broke the trait with Nurmaha\u2019s Ring.</p><br/><p>Maybe it was because he valued safety over anything but his ability to sense danger was beyond everyone else.</p><br/><p>He was going to ignore it and look for a chance to clean up so he didn\u2019t show anything but that guy had decided to run as soon as things didn\u2019t work out according to his plan.</p><br/><p>\u2018You didn\u2019t spend 20 years in vain huh.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo applauded Miyamoto as he ran away.</p><br/><p>The way he ran was amazing as well.</p><br/><p>An unstable World Tree leaf, , had a short teleportation range and the location was random also.</p><br/><p>But from the light surrounding his body, it seemed like he had quite an intact leaf.</p><br/><p>With that then he could probably run away to anywhere in the World Tree Mountain Range.</p><br/><p>It seems like he was going to wait until the Dimensional Door opened in a safe place.</p><br/><p>But there was something that guy didn\u2019t know.</p><br/><p>That when you become the Administrator of the World Tree, it wasn\u2019t hard to find someone who had Miyamoto\u2019s level of power.</p><br/><p>Which meant if he wanted to hide then he had to get to a place that even Hansoo had trouble getting to.</p><br/><p>\u2018I shall help you a bit. So your feather wouldn\u2019t go to waste.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo lightly laughed and then started to raise up the relic\u2019s mana code.</p><br/><p>Soon the cross on his forehead started to shine.</p><br/><p>At those words the World Tree, which was the reason of the teleportation power, started to change the coordinates of the teleportation.</p><br/><p>And soon Miyamoto\u2019s body disappeared within the light.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>Hoooong</p><br/><p>Miyamoto looked at his surroundings after coming out from the light.</p><br/><p>The place he had chosen to run away was the sanctuary he had created in the end of the World Tree just in case of an unexpected event.</p><br/><p>But Miyamoto realized that something was wrong.</p><br/><p>A cold wind blew past his face.</p><br/><p>Only white clouds could be seen around him instead of the underground sanctuary.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is\u2026 Branch?\u2019</p><br/><p>Miyamoto spat out a puzzled sound after checking beneath his feet.</p><br/><p>An extremely thick branch of the World Tree that felt like the ground.</p><br/><p>But the problem wasn\u2019t that.</p><br/><p>Bzzzzzzzzzz</p><br/><p>Rapid beatings of wings.</p><br/><p>And they weren\u2019t just coming from one location.</p><br/><p>A loud noise was coming out from all around the clouds around him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Goddamnit\u2026 The Wasp Legion!\u2019</p><br/><p>A place where not even a Red Zone adventurer who came to the Branches for artifacts set their foot into.</p><br/><p>Miyamoto\u2019s expression got covered in fear.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuaaaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>And soon the huge wing-beating sounds started to resonate from around Miyamoto.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ll come to take the things you have later.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo coldly looked into the location in the sky and then jumped back into the Ouroboros.</p><br/><p>Since there weren\u2019t any more disturbances, he just needed to smash one more Nerve.</p><br/><p>\u2018Anyways\u2026 Why is the clone controlling it like this?\u2019</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no way that this guy would stay quiet like this.</p><br/><p>Hansoo stopped rushing in and gazed at the Skull of the Ouroboros where the clone would be.</p><br/><p>Proofreader\u2019s note</p><br/><p>Regular chapter 2/3.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

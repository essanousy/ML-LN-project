Fuck.\u2019</p><br/><p>The debris created from the Birdcage falling apart was dyed in blood.</p><br/><p>Of course not his but blood of others.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuaaaaa\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Crunch Crunch</p><br/><p>Makeronia chomped a leg of a human in order to relieve a bit of stress as he started to stomp his way towards the humans in the center of the lake.</p><br/><p>\u201cUaaaa\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe. Why? Do we look that easy since we don\u2019t have mana anymore?\u201d</p><br/><p>Makeronia laughed as he looked at the human screaming out in pain.</p><br/><p>It was truth that the Rebeloongs were much more inferior to the Akalachias and Rebeloongs physically.</p><br/><p>But that only applied to 1st and 2nd generation members, the 3rd generation members like him weren\u2019t that much weaker than the Arukons due to their larger number.</p><br/><p>But killing a few bugs wasn\u2019t enough to relieve his stress entirely.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn. I can\u2019t contact the Satellite Fortress because there\u2019s no mana\u2026 So this is the Destruction jade I\u2019ve been hearing about huh.\u2019</p><br/><p>Being affected by it felt horrible.</p><br/><p>The barrier of the Satellite Fortress that protected him had disappeared and the Destruction Beam that could set the grounds aflame did not come out either.</p><br/><p>For him, somebody who received great treatment even out of the Rebeloongs, to become like this.</p><br/><p>\u2018I need to figure out the situation first.\u2019</p><br/><p>Makeronia finished his thoughts and then started to walk towards the humans who fell into the lake in the distance.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Karhal got up from the waters and then asked a question while looking at the rat face approaching him from the distance.</p><br/><p>He was curious the whole time he fell down.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do now? We have no way of finding that small item called the Destruction Jade?\u201d</p><br/><p>Karhal asked with a confused expression.</p><br/><p>If the Destruction Jade was that small then the other side could hide it anywhere in this place.</p><br/><p>Karhal thought that there wasn\u2019t anyone below here because Hansoo had came in with such confidence.</p><br/><p>Or that they were all trapped or immobile.</p><br/><p>But Karhal could not understand how Hansoo was going to find a tiny object within a space where tens of thousands of people are running around in chaos.</p><br/><p>\u2018And it\u2019s not like we have a lot of time either.\u2019</p><br/><p>The inside was a chaos and there was a limit to how long Junghwan could hold on outside.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be hard with just the Destruction Jade alone anyway\u201d</p><br/><p>Even Eres couldn\u2019t cover the entire zone with the Destruction Jade in the past.</p><br/><p>Like how the Sealing Jade needed a enhancement, the Destruction Jade needed one as well.</p><br/><p>Hansoo mumbled while looking at the already chaotic Birdcage.</p><br/><p>The Destruction Jade was powerful but it was not enough.</p><br/><p>It might\u2019ve been different if the Destruction Jade was powerful enough to stop the entire zone but it was not.</p><br/><p>Since even Eres had run away after using the Destruction Jade in the past.</p><br/><p>\u2018I need to find a complementary object for this.\u2019</p><br/><p>Below here.</p><br/><p>There was something below this location, which was originally designed as a research facility, that would complement the Destruction Jade.</p><br/><p>Something created as a pair to the Destruction Jade.</p><br/><p>\u2018Since the two resonate\u2026I\u2019ll be able to find the Destruction Jade if I find that.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo finished his thoughts and started to walk away.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll now go underground from here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Where?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo pointed towards the giant rat that was holding onto seven different humans as it walked over to them from the question.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find out if we ask.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wouldn\u2019t the original visitors of the Birdcage know that the best?</p><br/><p>Crunch Crunch.</p><br/><p>\u2018What kind of rat\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Karhal frowned.</p><br/><p>A 4m large rat.</p><br/><p>A mouse was a cute animal within Karhal\u2019s memories since he used to raise a pet hamster but when it grew to 4m in size, it was a completely different story.</p><br/><p>And even more so if it held humans with broken necks in its hands.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t just look like a rat standing up but rather much similar to a human due to the abnormally developed upper body muscles.</p><br/><p>Actually, if Hansoo\u2019s body was stretched to twice his size and put on a giant rat mask then he would look just like that.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s a fucking crazy Mickey Mouse. It is doing an amazing job destroying my childhood.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo spoke towards Karhal.</p><br/><p>\u201cSupport. I taught you the sign language right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmhm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Karhal nodded.</p><br/><p>He was quite tense but he had no confidence to do anything alone in this place.</p><br/><p>What the hell would he do in a place like this by himself.</p><br/><p>\u2018Follow him for now.\u2019</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Booooom!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Makeronia made a dumbfounded expression at the human who had started charging towards him.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t abnormal to see a human charging at him.</p><br/><p>Since the fearless ones trapped in the Birdcage charged at him the moment mana sustaining the barriers disappeared.</p><br/><p>But nobody had charged at him by themselves like this before.</p><br/><p>They charged in numbers of hundreds at the least.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Makeronia threw away the humans in his hand and was about to smash Hansoo with his lifted right hand.</p><br/><p>Twitch</p><br/><p>Hansoo, who was inspecting the Rebeloong closely while charging, sent a signal with his empty left hand which did not hold the spear.</p><br/><p>Karhal gulped at the strange movements of the hand as he sent an attack with the .</p><br/><p>Booooom!</p><br/><p>The bowstring rang as the arrow flew across and charged towards the giant mouse violently.</p><br/><p>To be exact it was heading towards the right side of the heart Hansoo had signed him to shoot towards.</p><br/><p>Chwaaaa!</p><br/><p>Makeronia scoffed as he looked at the arrow flying towards him.</p><br/><p>Not bad.</p><br/><p>A bug who had this much strength was within the strongest of the bugs.</p><br/><p>But their races were still different.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t have the sixth sense or the tenacity of the Arukons but he still had muscles, senses and a body that was dimensions apart in quality.</p><br/><p>The target of the arrow could clearly be seen by him.</p><br/><p>And he could easily dodge it.</p><br/><p>\u2018I guess I\u2019ll have to try a bit.\u2019</p><br/><p>Crunch</p><br/><p>The moment Makeronia scoffed and was about to focus onto the arrow flying towards him.</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s eyes shone.</p><br/><p>At the same time.</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s speed rose by multiple times in an instant.</p><br/><p>The Dragon Essence Blade lined up within his body as it enhanced his body and the liquid metal of the Body Enhancement Surgery further enhanced the previous result.</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s body, which was still at a human\u2019s level, evolved even beyond the Rebeloong.</p><br/><p>The body that could fight against Dakidus when his runes were crawling upon the very bottom had now received the blessings of 100% maximized runes as his body\u2019s strength easily rose over the limit of destroying a Rebeloong.</p><br/><p>Makeronia, who was focused entirely on the arrow, turned around at the sudden change in noise and then freaked out at the human who was charging towards him with a speed that was unbelievably faster than what it had been before.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou..You fucking rat!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFunny.\u201d</p><br/><p>Whoosh</p><br/><p>A painful mistake.</p><br/><p>The human had gotten up to his face in an instant and was slashing its spear at his head.</p><br/><p>Makeronia fell in despair as he stared at the golden spear that was flying in to penetrate his head and tried to call for his comrades.</p><br/><p>He was acting solo because of the pride as a 3rd Generation member but as he fell into a dangerous situation, the swarm instincts within his blood had boiled up.</p><br/><p>He was different than the Akalachias or the Arukons who lived in small communities.</p><br/><p>They were a race who used their massive numbers of their swarm to suppress the enemy.</p><br/><p>The instincts that were sleeping within his blood since it wasn\u2019t needed due to him not having met any powerful opponents suddenly exploded out.</p><br/><p>\u201cKiii\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>But it was too late.</p><br/><p>Crunch</p><br/><p>The spear that was heading for his head made a strange twist as it penetrated his vocal chord near his neck.</p><br/><p>\u201c!!\u201d</p><br/><p>And as the vocal chords got cut and the spear blocked his throat, the scream that was coming up got stopped.</p><br/><p>Makeronia freaked out as he tried to retaliate.</p><br/><p>Since he could continue to move as long as his head remained intact.</p><br/><p>But sadly the spear that cut through his vocal chords did not stop there as it continued to penetrate its way through.</p><br/><p>Kwaduduk.</p><br/><p>The spear that cut through his vocal chords dug in even deeper, smashed through his skull and stopped right in front of the brain and numerous other nerves.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026.gurgle.\u201d</p><br/><p>The entire body of Makeronia that was about to retaliate stopped moving.</p><br/><p>The muscles loosened up as the lower body that was supporting him started to give away.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Makeronia couldn\u2019t stand up any longer after the nerves that reached down to his body got severed as he slowly fell down backwards.</p><br/><p>Everyone freaked out as they saw Hansoo who had turned a Higher Race half dead in an instant.</p><br/><p>For somebody to turn that monstrous being into a retard in an instant.</p><br/><p>And the amazement was the same to Karhal as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cWoah\u2026Can\u2019t you just handle all of this once your mana comes back?\u201d</p><br/><p>Karhal joked around as he spoke.</p><br/><p>For him to smash apart something that even hundreds of people had a hard time killing in an instant.</p><br/><p>The sensation that he hadn\u2019t been in this world that long when he fought Dakidus could clearly be felt now.</p><br/><p>Hansoo shook his head at Karhal\u2019s joke of a question.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like this because there\u2019s no mana.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t have a lot of skills and their mastery weren\u2019t high anyway.</p><br/><p>Since every skill were high quality they had a much stronger might than other people but that wasn\u2019t his strong point.</p><br/><p>The human\u2019s strongest point was the firepower coming from numerous chain activations of skills.</p><br/><p>If a manaless Hansoo was like having his hands and legs tied, a normal adventurer without mana was like an armless and legless person.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well. It wouldn\u2019t be as much as these guys though.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo mumbled as he looked at the Rebeloong twitching on the ground with its head almost cut off.</p><br/><p>These guys were probably beyond being armless and legless and instead probably felt like a fish out of water.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s nice I got him before he screamed.\u2019</p><br/><p>This guy was the weakest of the three race in terms of one on one battle but their numbers were the problem.</p><br/><p>He had profited since he had ambushed while it had been distracted but if his comrades came running after it screamed out then things would\u2019ve turned much more tiresome.</p><br/><p>Gurgle.</p><br/><p>Hansoo approached the Rebeloong who was watching him in fear on the ground and then sat upon its chest.</p><br/><p>He then asked with his fingers raised.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat generation?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGurgle\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you answer well then I\u2019ll end you quick and painlessly. If not then I\u2019ll just leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>At those words the fear in Makeronia\u2019s eyes deepened.</p><br/><p>It was better to die cleanly here.</p><br/><p>Since the ones who he had thrown away were glaring at him in rage and hate after realizing the situation.</p><br/><p>\u2018Even\u2026Even the shit I have done to these guys alone in this place is enough\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>The moment Hansoo\u2019s fingers, which were rotating around 1, 2 and 3, landed on 3.</p><br/><p>Makeronia used his eyelids which were still moving and hurriedly blinked numerous times.</p><br/><p>\u201cA third generation\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait! Don\u2019t kill him!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment the rage filled voices were heard by Hansoo.</p><br/><p>Crunch.</p><br/><p>Hansoo smashed apart the head of the Rebeloong and stood up as if he was done here.</p><br/><p>Karhal made a confused expression from those actions.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you need these guys?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo shook his head at those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need these things. I need the ones who lived here originally.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe ones who lived here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded.</p><br/><p>1st Generation.</p><br/><p>He needed the ancient beasts that used to live here hundreds of years ago and still continued to live here.</p><br/><p>This place.</p><br/><p>The beginnings of the Higher Race who had gained their strength from the Sage\u2019s research lab, the</p><br/><p>\u2018Parrot, rat, dog and monkey\u2026Quite a lot huh.\u2019</p><br/><p>Ones who had become a new race after being enhanced so they can create the , which was the base of the Sage\u2019s power, within their own body.</p><br/><p>\u2018If I can attain that then\u2026The humans would also be able to attain a sea of mana that they can use.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo thought of his final goal.</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s Note : Oh shit. Dat foreshadow</p><br/><p>Red Zone : Breeding Grounds.</p><br/><p>Orange Zone : Steroids Factory.</p><br/><p>Yellow Zone : Hogwarts?</p><br/><p>We shall see.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

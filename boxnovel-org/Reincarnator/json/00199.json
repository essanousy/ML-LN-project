There weren\u2019t any traces of such things on the survivors back then.\u2019</p><br/><p>Pektoril made a confused expression while walking through the giant room where hundreds of thousands of people were asleep as if they were dead.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t the only thing he was curious about.</p><br/><p>Since he needed to figure out what Metiron had done after he entered this place.</p><br/><p>He might\u2019ve escaped with something incredibly precious.</p><br/><p>At that moment something was caught in Pektoril\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>A gem that was shining bright red.</p><br/><p>At the end of the collider where hundreds of thousands of containers were laid on, a bright gem was embedded on the wall.</p><br/><p>\u2018What is that?\u2019</p><br/><p>The size of the gem was small but the size of the machine that the gem was embedded in was actually very big.</p><br/><p>As if it was devouring the light coming out from the bright gem, the complex circuits that extended away from the gem as the center were sending the bright light towards the hundreds of thousands of containers where the Sages were hibernating in.</p><br/><p>Like an energy of life that was supporting the ones who had fallen into slumber.</p><br/><p>The moment Pektoril started to head towards the gem with a curious expression.</p><br/><p>Booooom!</p><br/><p>A loud sound was heard behind him.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026.?\u2019</p><br/><p>Pektoril turned around to see if his comrades had followed him but a smirk appeared on his face instead.</p><br/><p>Pektoril spoke towards the human who has jumped down.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow resilient. For what do you struggle this much for?\u201d</p><br/><p>This guy was dead anyway.</p><br/><p>The story might\u2019ve been different if the Destruction Jade was still activated but as long as the jade was in his hands and it stopped working, this puny human wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything to him who had the protection of the Satellite Fortress.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, maybe not\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Pektoril frowned as he looked at the tremendous amount of mana flowing through the guy in the distance.</p><br/><p>Something with that much battle strength, that much mana and that much power to generate such a force was not something that could be ignored.</p><br/><p>It might\u2019ve been different for others but for the Akalachias, who often hunted the humans in order to keep their battle instincts sharp, knew.</p><br/><p>That the thing making that guy being hard to deal with was not his physical abilities but a trick with a skill.</p><br/><p>And since someone of his caliber wouldn\u2019t have some random skill, it would actually be quite threatening.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well. I\u2019ll still win anyway.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was good.</p><br/><p>Since it would\u2019ve become much more tiring if that guy ran away with the Red Jade.</p><br/><p>\u2018I shall kill you here.\u2019</p><br/><p>The moment Pektoril made up this decision.</p><br/><p>Booooom!</p><br/><p>Hansoo flew across the distance and closed in on Pektoril.</p><br/><p>Whoooosh!</p><br/><p>A giant spear that was over 10m long and shining brightly flew towards Hansoo.</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>The golden spear in Hansoo\u2019s hand, the Forked Lightning, and Pektoril\u2019s spear clashed with each other as the room they were in trembled from the aftershock.</p><br/><p>But the result was clear.</p><br/><p>Booooom!</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s body couldn\u2019t withstand the tremendous amount of force behind the giant spear and was flung into the air.</p><br/><p>Even before the force of the two sides, this was actually a difference in mass.</p><br/><p>Even the tip of Pektoril\u2019s spearhead was heavier than Hansoo.</p><br/><p>Pektoril, who had smashed away Hansoo with a mass hundreds of times heavier, frowned as he felt the tingling sensation on the tip of his fingers.</p><br/><p>Hansoo being flung away was quite normal but the amount of force he felt in his fingers was too underwhelming.</p><br/><p>This was too weak for Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u2018Did he fling his body backwards or something.\u2019</p><br/><p>Chwaaaak!</p><br/><p>Hansoo, who had been flung into the air, looked at his cracked armor, the Thousand Soldiers Armor.</p><br/><p>Despite having eaten the spear of a dead Akalachia on the way and having been protected by Hansoo\u2019s Demonic Dragon\u2019s Reinforcement it still received quite a large amount of damage.</p><br/><p>It was a destructive force that came from strength and mass combined.</p><br/><p>Booooom!</p><br/><p>Pektoril\u2019s attacks, which didn\u2019t seem like it wanted to give any break to Hansoo, had a qualitative differences from the Rebeloongs or other Akalachias who focused on brute strength.</p><br/><p>Hansoo judged that the golden spear would be hard to dodge from its trajectory as he chucked the Forked Lighting as the same time he took on Pektoril\u2019s spear with his body.</p><br/><p>Kwadududuk!</p><br/><p>The pillar-like spear that was surrounded by the mana barrier from the Satellite Fortress cut through Hansoo\u2019s Demonic Dragon\u2019s Reinforcement as it smashed onto Hansoo\u2019s Thousand Soldeirs Armor and Dragon Essence Blade.</p><br/><p>At the same time.</p><br/><p>Crunch!</p><br/><p>The Forked Lightning that shot out from Hansoo\u2019s hand assaulted the area near Pektoril\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Kudududuk</p><br/><p>The Forked Lightning, which had the mana nullification applied on it, penetrated through the mana barrier around Pektoril and dug into his golden feathers.</p><br/><p>As it had penetrated through the Judge\u2019s armor in the past.</p><br/><p>Sway.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hmm.\u2019</p><br/><p>Pektoril frowned as he felt the strange mana digging into his body and disrupting his five senses.</p><br/><p>But if he was going to get dealt with with just this much then it would\u2019ve been better for him to just commit suicide.</p><br/><p>\u2018And\u2026I\u2019ve gone through things like this plenty of times when I was being experimented on by the Sages in the past!\u2019</p><br/><p>Booooom!</p><br/><p>Pektoril spun his foot around, stomped down onto the ground with it and then swung his spear in a wide arc.</p><br/><p>Whoooosh!</p><br/><p>The 5m large Judge and Pektoril in front of Hansoo\u2019s eyes were vastly different in size.</p><br/><p>The 10m spear being swung was more than enough to prevent him from getting near Pektoril.</p><br/><p>Crunch! Crunch! Clang!</p><br/><p>Tens of the glass containers got destroyed by the swing of the spear.</p><br/><p>The bodies of the Sages that had been protected by the blue light had been swept by the afters wing and had been turned into meat pastes.</p><br/><p>A very tragic death after having been carefully protected for hundreds of years.</p><br/><p>Hansoo, who had been charging in, suddenly backed off as he mumbled.</p><br/><p>\u2018So, he lived for hundreds of years huh.\u2019</p><br/><p>Pektoril had only swung his spear once, quickly adapted to the sudden changes of his senses and recovered himself.</p><br/><p>He was different from the others from before.</p><br/><p>Someone who had lived in the jungle and had constantly polished and sharpened themselves after their fight with the Sages.</p><br/><p>Pektoril laughed out loud towards Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha! Don\u2019t you feel sad? Aren\u2019t these the ones who have given you the power?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was understanding that guy\u2019s identity bit by bit.</p><br/><p>He knew too much for a bug.</p><br/><p>That guy had definitely received some legacy or inheritance from the Sages who had ran away.</p><br/><p>Pektoril\u2019s feathers rang as he looked at the Red Jade in his hands.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2026 Don\u2019t have the rights to use that. Only us, the Higher Races, have the right to.\u2019</p><br/><p>Pektoril then looked around his surroundings with his somewhat adapted vision.</p><br/><p>Corpses which had been smashed apart into meat pastes.</p><br/><p>\u2018Keheh. Kehehehehehe.\u2019</p><br/><p>This stimulated the sadistic nature deep within Pektoril\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>The fact that the Sages had disappeared without reason had always pressured him.</p><br/><p>But look at this!</p><br/><p>For them to have been here all along living the life of frozen foods.</p><br/><p>Tens of Sages, whom could threaten his entire race with only 500 of them, had been killed by his single swing.</p><br/><p>\u2018Isn\u2019t this a bit too sad for someone who wielded such a tremendous amount of power?! Haha!\u2019</p><br/><p>Pektoril smiled.</p><br/><p>Even if one had a tremendous amount of mana and technology, there was a limit to the weak bodies.</p><br/><p>Just like the Akion.</p><br/><p>A vastly different amount of strength was shown because they were using it and not the Sages.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is just the beginning.\u2019</p><br/><p>Pektoril mumbled in happiness from his vision of the future.</p><br/><p>If this world got united under his feet then there wouldn\u2019t be useless fights and struggles anymore.</p><br/><p>The Higher Races who had powerful bodies would be able to use the Sage\u2019s technologies more efficiently.</p><br/><p>They wouldn\u2019t be using the leftover technology of the Sages but improve it and create a new civilization for themselves.</p><br/><p>Pektoril smiled as he looked at the ring in his hand and then put it back on his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou probably want this but\u2026Keke. It seems you don\u2019t have the powers to take it from me. It seems like a set pair anyway, how about giving it to me now? I\u2019ll let you live at elast.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pektoril\u2019s words weren\u2019t empty words actually.</p><br/><p>He was willing to let the bug live since today was a historically celebratory date.</p><br/><p>Though he would have to live as his personal pet inside the Birdcage for all eternity.</p><br/><p>\u2018And\u2026I will slowly figure out why the Sages have decided to go into cryo-sleep in his location.\u2019</p><br/><p>He wanted to ask the bug but it seemed like he didn\u2019t know either.</p><br/><p>Which meant that there was nothing else he was curious about.</p><br/><p>\u201cSure\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pektoril flinched at the unexpected answer.</p><br/><p>Though he had thrown the words at him, he had never expected Hansoo to agree so he was actually preparing to smash him apart.</p><br/><p>But for such a reply to come back.</p><br/><p>The moment Pektoril flinched.</p><br/><p>Kuurururuk</p><br/><p>Something started to intensely grow out from where the Forked Lightning had penetrated into.</p><br/><p>Crunch</p><br/><p>Kwadduk.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Pektoril was shocked at the strange things growing all over his body and tying him down as he tried to snap them with brute force.</p><br/><p>\u2018Just this?!\u2019</p><br/><p>With his strength, this amount of sludge could easily be broken apart.</p><br/><p>But unlike Pektoril\u2019s expectations, his body hadn\u2019t fully calibrated yet.</p><br/><p>In the short moment where Pektoril stopped due to his muscles and nerves acting separately from each other, the Pandemic Blade which had eaten up Hansoo\u2019s entire mana pool grew and covered Pektoril\u2019s entire body.</p><br/><p>The moment Pektoril\u2019s movements stopped completely from these two things.</p><br/><p>\u201cCatch it. Well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Whooosh!</p><br/><p>Hansoo chucked the Red Jade in his hand.</p><br/><p>Towards the black jade in his hand, the Destruction jade.</p><br/><p>\u201cArrrgh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Pektoril sensed something amiss and tried to move his hand away but the speed of the Red Jade Hansoo threw was like a beam of light.</p><br/><p>The moment Pektoril tried to move, the Red Jade had already moved up to the Destruction jade.</p><br/><p>Then</p><br/><p>Clang!</p><br/><p>Powerful tools which showed their true prowess when together but had to be split in two because of their tremendous power.</p><br/><p>The Red Jade and the Destruction Jade smashed with each other with a clang and started to swirl and combine with each other.</p><br/><p>While making a extremely ominous dark and bloody yin yang symbol.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. Has it started.\u201d</p><br/><p>Metiron, who had been running away, suddenly smiled.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

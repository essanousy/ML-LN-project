Sir Tiamet! Please! We\u2019re allies!\u201d</p><br/><p>Countless mages died while screaming around the field.</p><br/><p>But the finger floating in the air didn\u2019t care as it continued to flick around and turned the surrounding area into blazing hell.</p><br/><p>Boooooom!</p><br/><p>The Barrier got destroyed and the War Fortress slowly broke apart.</p><br/><p>And because Hansoo couldn\u2019t focus on the flail, the energy that had flown into the flail just dispersed into the air.</p><br/><p>The Stake, which was no longer obstructed, was continuously increasing the size of the hole.</p><br/><p>Everybody felt shivers run down their back as they saw Tiamet\u2019s eyes gazing towards them from across the hole which was now the size of a fist.</p><br/><p>Though Timaet was smiling, it actually made him look scarier.</p><br/><p>Eyes that didn\u2019t look at humans like they were humans.</p><br/><p>Those eyes were blazing with his greed and desire.</p><br/><p>And the mages knew.</p><br/><p>How scary things got when a person who didn\u2019t consider other humans as his own kind gained a tremendous amount of strength.</p><br/><p>Just a finger was this strong, what would happen if his entire body came through?</p><br/><p>Of course there wasn\u2019t much time for them to think about this.</p><br/><p>Boooooom!</p><br/><p>Since another beam swept by and erased them from this world.</p><br/><p>\u201cUaaaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>Arthus Krancheska, who has been laid flat on the ground, grinded his teeth while watching this scene.</p><br/><p>\u201cFucking bastard...Kuaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>They were indeed arrogant but they were still his underlings.</p><br/><p>People who he had grown and trained himself.</p><br/><p>They were not people who should be dying like this.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fucking bastard...You\u2019re smiling?\u2019</p><br/><p>For him to have taken that monster as a role model at one point.</p><br/><p>At this rate everyone would die.</p><br/><p>From that finger that was cutting across the air for fun.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fuck...Fuck! If only I could use mana! If only!\u2019</p><br/><p>Even without the prison, his level still remained.</p><br/><p>But without any mana, he was merely a powerless human being.</p><br/><p>As Arthus Krancheska watched the entire scene in despair.</p><br/><p>Tutututuk</p><br/><p>He felt a hand touching his back.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>The suppression that had blocked his mana was released.</p><br/><p>Arthus Krancheska turned around as he felt the mana releasing out from his heart and regenerating his body.</p><br/><p>To see who had released the suppression on his body.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well. It would be that person.\u2019</p><br/><p>The Ain.</p><br/><p>It should be her.</p><br/><p>Since only the one who had placed the suppression could break it down this easily.</p><br/><p>But he was filled with confusion as he turned around.</p><br/><p>\u201c...Who are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Arthus Krancheska muttered as he saw the one standing behind him.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t a difference in appearance.</p><br/><p>The Ain who had been fighting with him who was over level 300.</p><br/><p>The one inside that body was an entirely different being.</p><br/><p>He could tell from just one look.</p><br/><p>It was not the eyes filled with fear and rage that had fought with him.</p><br/><p>The eyes now looked calm and empty but were filled with a dim light.</p><br/><p>Like a well with the moon shining down upon it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As Krancheska made a confused expression.</p><br/><p>The Ain spoke towards him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems you aren\u2019t gonna move. Do you have that much free time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...Fuck.\u201d</p><br/><p>Arthus quickly regenerated his body with his superhuman amount of mana and glanced at the existence in from of him while opening and closing his hands.</p><br/><p>Though he didn\u2019t have the prison, he had more than enough strength to deal with weaklings.</p><br/><p>It was more than enough beat down his thing in front of him.</p><br/><p>As well as the one dodging the attacks madly in the distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh. Fucking hell.\u201d</p><br/><p>Krancheska spat on the ground and headed towards the formation.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t like the eyes that seemed to know everything but there was no time to waste.</p><br/><p>Krancheska reached the formation and then stomped on the ground a few times.</p><br/><p>A mana wave spread out from where he had stomped and through Eloa and the few dozens of mages who were still alive.</p><br/><p>And this simple movement was very effective.</p><br/><p>Whoooosh!</p><br/><p>The mages felt their mana circuits recovering as well as their bodies.</p><br/><p>Krancheska stomped again as he saw this.</p><br/><p>Toong!</p><br/><p>If the previous wave was for regenerating their mana, this one was for communication.</p><br/><p>A special and intricate mana code told them one thing as it swept by them.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>The mages gritted their teeth and nodded as they stood up.</p><br/><p>Nobody would allow a tiger to escape its cage even if they didn\u2019t have a hostile relationship.</p><br/><p>Though that bastard didn\u2019t have any bad blood with them, there was no telling what this man would do if he got across.</p><br/><p>The mages carefully started to position around the formation.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Booooom!</p><br/><p>Tiamet looked around at the scene in leisure through the hole which was now the size of a fist.</p><br/><p>The outside world which he hadn\u2019t seen in a very long time.</p><br/><p>\u2018Soon I\u2019ll be able to send out two fingers.\u2019</p><br/><p>Boooooom!</p><br/><p>Tiamet swept the surroundings once more and smirked at Hansoo who had distanced himself away from his attacks.</p><br/><p>He had heard what this guy was doing here.</p><br/><p>But the goal Hansoo was trying to achieve wouldn\u2019t be fulfilled.</p><br/><p>Since he was confident in himself.</p><br/><p>What could that golden army do?</p><br/><p>\u2018But...It\u2019s annoying when he\u2019s this good at dodging.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tiamet had actually been quite annoyed for a while.</p><br/><p>Though it had started as a joke, that guy was dodging him way too easily.</p><br/><p>He had started attacking with the intention of sending a leg flying but that weakling was amazing at dodging.</p><br/><p>As if that guy was very experienced with fighting those who were strong.</p><br/><p>Of course if his actual body was over there this would mean nothing but in a situation where he could only use a finger, he was feeling quite annoyed.</p><br/><p>Tiamet frowned as he spoke towards the man glaring at him from the distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t resist meaninglessly like this. You guys...Cannot become the owners of this place. Be thankful that you\u2019re living by us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo frowned.</p><br/><p>He knew what these words meant.</p><br/><p>From the things he had experienced.</p><br/><p>\u2018But still\u2026 It\u2019s more than I expected.\u2019</p><br/><p>At this rate that guy will really come over to this side.</p><br/><p>And there was no way for him to block this from happening.</p><br/><p>\u2018Nothing I can do.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo clenched his teeth.</p><br/><p>His original goal was to take the formation, use the flail as a medium and devour everything with that energy.</p><br/><p>Then the War Fortress would become something that nobody would be able to break through.</p><br/><p>He would help the Ains with that strength to let them into the Spirit land, use this place as a base of operations and from there start his next plans.</p><br/><p>But since things had become like this, there was nothing he could do.</p><br/><p>He had to use the final method.</p><br/><p>\u2018Blow it apart.\u2019</p><br/><p>Booooooooom!</p><br/><p>Hansoo mumbled as he dodged another beam which barely missed the formation.</p><br/><p>Blow apart the energy from the formation.</p><br/><p>And destroy everything in the vicinity.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s a waste but\u2026 Nothing else can be done.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo deeply breathed in and out.</p><br/><p>Though destroying the formation would be a waste and he and his golden army would take a considerable amount of damage, this was still much better than that guy coming over to this side and using the formation.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>A ray of voice made its way to Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201c...?\u201d</p><br/><p>A voice that came into his head.</p><br/><p>\u2018They had this sort of ability?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo made a shocked expression as he heard the voice of the Ain, though slightly different, in his head.</p><br/><p>\u2018...No way.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s head quickly deduced the situation.</p><br/><p>To figure out the identity of the speaker.</p><br/><p>Who had this kind of ability?</p><br/><p>\u2018Ah\u2026 For it to have come personally\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded and then started to charge towards the flail.</p><br/><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><br/><p>\u201c...This crazy bastard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tiamet made a confused expression at Hansoo who had started running while shaking the ground.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is he trying to die?\u2019</p><br/><p>Tiamet flicked his finger.</p><br/><p>To end the man having his final struggle.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Whooooosh!</p><br/><p>A flaming cloud surrounded Hansoo\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>As if it was trying to use Hansoo as a shield.</p><br/><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><br/><p>Tiamet stopped at the sudden appearance of the Ain but then smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cMudusella. It seems the difference between us has grown too far now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tiamet shook his head at the giant man charging and the Ain stuck behind him.</p><br/><p>For her to have become like this where she didn\u2019t even have the confidence to appear before him without some weakling defending her like this.</p><br/><p>\u2018I won\u2019t kill you at least.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tiamet decided to deal with the man in front of him and pointed towards the guy.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>A beam extended out from his finger and headed towards the man.</p><br/><p>But right before he was about to be hit.</p><br/><p>Kududududuuk!</p><br/><p>Something broke up from the ground and blocked in front of him.</p><br/><p>A giant blue bronze object.</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>The blue bronze wall couldn\u2019t block the beam completely and allowed it to puncture a hole through it, it was still successful in allowing Hansoo to barely dodge.</p><br/><p>And Tiamet was dumbfounded by this scene.</p><br/><p>\u2018Aren\u2019t they fearless. They could\u2019ve lived if they were lucky\u2026 They dare act against me?\u2019</p><br/><p>He had seen them moving around in the back but he had thought that they would strike Hansoo instead of going against him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Maybe I\u2019m trusting these guys too much.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tiamet decided to kill off these guys once he got through as he flicked his finger to kill off Hansoo once again.</p><br/><p>Kiiiiiiing!</p><br/><p>\u2018Let me end you.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was too close to dodge now.</p><br/><p>As he finished preparing to shoot the man who had come all the way to the formation.</p><br/><p>\u2018Wait, where did she go?\u2019</p><br/><p>Tiamet frowned as he saw that Mudusella had disappeared from behind the man who had come out from the blue bronze barrier.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Whooosh!</p><br/><p>Tiamet frowned as he saw Mudusella flying towards the flail after dispersing like a cloud.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is she\u2026?\u2019</p><br/><p>He finally remembered her role in the past.</p><br/><p>Mudusella was an administrator.</p><br/><p>She knew many more things about divine power than him.</p><br/><p>If she were to connect with the divine power\u2026</p><br/><p>Tiamet made a grim expression.</p><br/><p>\u2018That\u2019s not good.\u2019</p><br/><p>Though it started as a favor, he had taken action and it was his responsibility to end the situation.</p><br/><p>What if there was a possibility of failure?</p><br/><p>Nothing had ever gone against the way he wanted and this time shouldn\u2019t be any different.</p><br/><p>\u2018I was going to let you live\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Kiiiiiing!</p><br/><p>As Mudusella was starting to condense into one form and the finger was about to attack her.</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you trying to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo, who had arrived all the way up to him, smashed his finger.</p><br/><p>Whooosh!</p><br/><p>An attack backed with the full strength of someone and the flick of a finger.</p><br/><p>Even so, thinking about the difference in their strength, it would be normal for Hansoo to be flung away.</p><br/><p>But the result was different.</p><br/><p>\u2018...What the?\u2019</p><br/><p>Tiamet was shocked.</p><br/><p>For some reason he felt his body resistance that hardened his body get nullified and his finger was pushed back.</p><br/><p>And thanks to this his attack had missed.</p><br/><p>Boooooom!</p><br/><p>\u201c...You\u2019re really pissing me off.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once rage surpassed a certain point, it would stop showing.</p><br/><p>Tiamet\u2019s eyes calmed down and lost their fire but it was too late.</p><br/><p>Whooosh!</p><br/><p>Mudusella, who had been able to dodge the beam thanks to Hansoo, raised her hands towards Rangkom\u2019s stake and the God\u2019s Flail.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Whoooosh.</p><br/><p>A strange energy exploded out from Mudusella.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Mmm.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s five senses disappeared and his body stiffened.</p><br/><p>Hansoo pondered deeply to himself at the sensation of the world having stopped.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

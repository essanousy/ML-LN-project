It\u2019s cooked well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo stabbed at the meat with the kitchen knife that was almost completely dull and tasted it while chewing on it.</p><br/><p>Meat from which the toxins were perfectly removed by being boiled with blood and having been mixed with the Green Worm\u2019s pancreas.</p><br/><p>\u2018There\u2019s a lot of juices coming out too.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo spoke whilst eating leisurely:</p><br/><p>\u201cMost of the toxins within the goblin meat disappear if you boil it in goblin blood. Just don\u2019t eat the intestines or the liver.\u201d</p><br/><p>But the weren\u2019t in a situation where they could focus on that.</p><br/><p>The moonlight was accurately showing the mob of people charging at them.</p><br/><p>Mihee gulped as she saw the people running at them from afar.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you perhaps going to protect us when a fight breaks out between us and them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm. Perhaps if we\u2019re friends?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangjin\u2019s expression became bright at those words.</p><br/><p>Who else would be his friends other than them in this place?</p><br/><p>He and Mihee had abandoned Taesoon and picked Hansoo!</p><br/><p>But Mihee clenched her teeth at those words and spoke:</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026How do we become that friend?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo laughed at those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like a driver\u2019s exam, why would there be a condition to become a friend. You might have become a friend suddenly at one point.\u201d</p><br/><p>You don\u2019t become a friend who can trust each other and protect each other by fulfilling objectives.</p><br/><p>You become a friend by protecting and trusting each other in every situation</p><br/><p>\u2018Just like those guys.\u2019</p><br/><p>Sangjin then realized his misconception from Hansoo\u2019s words and then spoke as his face reddened:</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026But then how do we deal with those guys?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo shook his heads at those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should take care of yourself at least.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangjin was enraged by Hansoo\u2019s careless words.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamnit! Then why are we hanging around with you!\u201d</p><br/><p>But Hansoo only shrugged his shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should figure that answer out by yourself. The fact is that being with me is more dangerous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangjin clenched his teeth at those words.</p><br/><p>That was actually a fact.</p><br/><p>They followed after Hansoo and fought down the dangerous train station.</p><br/><p>If they didn\u2019t go with Hansoo and instead hung around the bigger crowd it would\u2019ve been safer.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo didn\u2019t have any notion of keeping them safe.</p><br/><p>Sangjin watched the people running towards them from afar as he clenched his teeth.</p><br/><p>Then he breathed in and out and started to walk over.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought that we could go to the end together but you\u2019re just too much. I thought that you were my friend but you do not care for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangjin started to walk towards a direction after ending his speech.</p><br/><p>And thought inwardly at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u2018But\u2026 I didn\u2019t do anything bad like that bitch Taesoon so if I come back after removing myself for a while he would probably take me back in.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo laughed at Sangjin who was taking shelter in order to first dodge the terrifying storm.</p><br/><p>\u2018Seriously huh.\u2019</p><br/><p>Once they tie them together in school for a few years, the word friend seems to have gotten much more common.</p><br/><p>Hansoo talked to Mihee as he looked at Sangjin who was leaving.</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going too? That\u2019s the best solution if you want to be safe.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mihee shook her head at those words.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026You won\u2019t take me back in if I leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018She\u2019s really quick to catch on.\u2019</p><br/><p>Mihee clenched her teeth while Hansoo laughed inwardly.</p><br/><p>\u2018This isn\u2019t the situation to look for an umbrella to escape the rain.\u2019</p><br/><p>The other friend hadn\u2019t realized the essential truth yet.</p><br/><p>They are instinctively looking for a safe place because of the dangerous situation.</p><br/><p>And since Hansoo seemed safe they had stayed there.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo didn\u2019t have the idea to protect them and they shouldn\u2019t be doing that anyways.</p><br/><p>They should not be looking for safety here. They needed to grow.</p><br/><p>They needed to rush their growth.</p><br/><p>To deal with the strong predators that will flood them.</p><br/><p>And it wasn\u2019t only beasts.</p><br/><p>If you did not want to get eaten up by humans you needed to become stronger at a faster pace than others.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo was talking very plainly.</p><br/><p>He said he wouldn\u2019t protect them but did not speak of not learning from him.</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t he say it before?</p><br/><p>He won\u2019t take them with him but he wouldn\u2019t mind them following.</p><br/><p>\u2018If they rely on something here\u2026 they will really die.\u2019</p><br/><p>Mihee came next to Hansoo, who was thinking, and started to cook the goblin meat after boiling the goblin blood.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is a gamble.\u2019</p><br/><p>She had too many things to learn.</p><br/><p>And to do that she needed to follow and learn from Hansoo, who had psychic powers, and hunt along with him.</p><br/><p>If she could survive today next to him then she had another day\u2019s worth of things she could learn.</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know when an unexpected variable like that moon come out.\u2019</p><br/><p>Mihee, who had strengthened her resolve, started to sharpen the knife to deal with the ones coming towards them.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHuff. Puff.\u201d</p><br/><p>The four who had ran zealously finally ended near Hansoo.</p><br/><p>Sunmi made a ridiculing expression as she saw the view in front of her.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026 Did he come to camp? And why is he using the pot separately.\u2019</p><br/><p>Sangjin was nowhere to be seen and only Mihee and Sangjin were left.</p><br/><p>The two were boiling something in the pot and were chewing on that.</p><br/><p>Sunmi clenched her teeth at this.</p><br/><p>\u2018These despicable guys. These two knew a way of preserving the food.\u2019</p><br/><p>It\u2019s no wonder they had left in such a leisure.</p><br/><p>These guys probably knew that all the food had burnt down to nothing.</p><br/><p>Sunmi, who had been grinding her teeth, breathed in and out and then shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u2018No. This is better actually\u2019</p><br/><p>If he knows the method he only needed to share it.</p><br/><p>\u2018And we didn\u2019t do anything wrong like Taesoon right?\u2019</p><br/><p>Actually Taesoon being taken by them was a benefit.</p><br/><p>That senseless guy was holding up his confidence even in a place like this.</p><br/><p>If she was Hansoo she would not let someone who acted like Taesoon alone.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yeah. If you want to go through this harsh world you need a trustworthy friend.\u2019</p><br/><p>Her mind was much more at ease after deciding.</p><br/><p>And once her mind was at ease, hunger was rising up.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn. I just realized that I couldn\u2019t get to eat anything.\u2019</p><br/><p>She was in a situation of tension for the whole day along with the intense exercise that she didn\u2019t usually perform made her energy usage much more severe.</p><br/><p>And it seemed like that the surrounding friends were in the same situation from their mouths watering from seeing the meat over there.</p><br/><p>Sunmi spoke out after setting her mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuff. You were here. Could we eat together?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo smirked and rose from his seat.</p><br/><p>And held the needle as he drew a circle around the area 3m away from him.</p><br/><p>Shiik. Shik.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Are you seriously going be that petty?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sunmi spoke out from utter disbelief.</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t grade schoolers or something, to draw a circle because they bickered a little.</p><br/><p>And they were simply bystanders.</p><br/><p>And the main culprit wasn\u2019t even here.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo didn\u2019t reply as he went back to his seat and started to chew as he continued his meal.</p><br/><p>Sunmi spoke out after staring at Hansoo for a while:</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I enter, what are you going to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo replied softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh I don\u2019t know. But from my psychic powers it seems that it won\u2019t be that good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 That bloody psychic powers shows such a thing too huh.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Sunmi grinded her teeth, Hansoo just shrugged his shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know other things too. Like if you stay here it would be dangerous for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as Hansoo spoke the four quickly looked behind them.</p><br/><p>They had forgotten momentarily from the security and distraction from the food in front of their eyes.</p><br/><p>That they were being chased.</p><br/><p>The mob was screaming in rage as they were running towards them.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at those bitches! They are cooking by themselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know this would happen! Those bitches are the ones that went into the convenience store first!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou dare to trick us?\u201d</p><br/><p>And in front of the mob, there was a half beaten up Taesoon.</p><br/><p>Jisun shouted in glee.</p><br/><p>\u201cTaesoon! You were saf\u2012\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up! You despicable bitch! You dare to leave me behind like that!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sunmi, Jisun and the others were startled at the enraged shouts that was resonating through the air.</p><br/><p>They were indeed in a hurry but they did indeed leave a friend behind.</p><br/><p>But Jisun rebutted in a hurry.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo it isn\u2019t like that! Listen to me! We were going to come to Hansoo and ask for help!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis crazy bitch! You dare say that!\u201d</p><br/><p>Taesoon shouted as he grinded his teeth.</p><br/><p>By that point he would have been badly beaten up.</p><br/><p>If he didn\u2019t beg, and didn\u2019t say he would go under them then it wouldn\u2019t have ended this easily and he would\u2019ve become minced meat.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fuck\u2026 to guys who are weaker than me\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no strong against a number.</p><br/><p>And that was the reason why he could not forgive them even more.</p><br/><p>\u2018These bitches. I wanted to be together.\u2019</p><br/><p>He could not forgive Hansoo, the four bitches and even Mihee who had betrayed him.</p><br/><p>And for that he was willing to go through a little bit of humiliation.</p><br/><p>Whilst Taesoon was looking over in rage, the shouts of the people were getting louder as well.</p><br/><p>But at that point Giltae came out as he shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cWoah. Woah. Calm down first everybody. The new guy should calm down too.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was the words of one person but they were rather intimidated.</p><br/><p>\u2018He has controlled the mob rather well.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded at the guy who had spoke to him when he first left.</p><br/><p>Since he came with a bunch of scruffy guys who treated him as the boss so controlling a mob wasn\u2019t that hard.</p><br/><p>Since he didn\u2019t seem like a normal person.</p><br/><p>Giltae smiled as he looked at Hansoo:</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you again. A young person has such abilities. Where did you get the meat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo bobbed his chin at those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you looking for meat from me when there\u2019s meat everywhere\u201d</p><br/><p>Giltae looked around the corpses that had been stacked around him.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026He ate that?\u2019</p><br/><p>Giltae hadn\u2019t already tried that out.</p><br/><p>Since he ordered a few to try it out.</p><br/><p>But that food was not something you could eat.</p><br/><p>The toxicity was so strong that the ones who had eaten are still having diarrhea and were suffering from dehydration.</p><br/><p>They will probably die. Since dehydration in a situation like this meant death.</p><br/><p>But he was eating that in ignorance.</p><br/><p>Giltae organized his thoughts and spoke:</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems that the younger brother knows the method of eating it.\u201d</p><br/><p>At those words Hansoo nodded as he spoke so everyone could hear:</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you boil it in goblin blood you can eat it. Go and try it.\u201d</p><br/><p>A simple intel such as this wouldn\u2019t hasten the process of the invasion of the Abyss.</p><br/><p>Giltae pondered inwardly as he looked at Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u2018Did they say this bitch had psychic powers\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>As they approached here, that Taesoon guy had babbled everything out.</p><br/><p>That the guy called Hansoo seemed to have psychic powers.</p><br/><p>And thanks to that they had all gotten stronger faster and attained the food from the store.</p><br/><p>\u2018And he obtained something valuable in there right?\u2019</p><br/><p>Giltae made his decisions quickly.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know what would happen the next day when the distance between them is spread apart further.</p><br/><p>And even though he had established a large group but most of them were normal people so they were hard to utilize in a fight.</p><br/><p>\u2018If we\u2019re going to fight then today\u2019s the day.\u2019</p><br/><p>He had no intention to kill.</p><br/><p>Why would he kill somebody with psychic powers.</p><br/><p>And no matter if he flew about he was only a normal person around twenty years of age.</p><br/><p>If he receives some beating and some knife cuts he will be in trauma and become submissive.</p><br/><p>And then he can suck out his bone marrow.</p><br/><p>\u2018The fact that he\u2019s in such a leisure is a bit troubling but\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>But he could figure that out and that would be that.</p><br/><p>Giltae, who had made his decision, gave a wink.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe new guy should go over and take a bite. Talk a little too. I heard you guys were friend. If you are friends that he should at least give you a bit of meat right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Taesoon,who was grinding his teeth, started to walk over proudly.</p><br/><p>\u2018If you indeed have some hidden motives then you shouldn\u2019t be able to act recklessly in front of this crowd.\u2019</p><br/><p>Taesoon took large steps as he headed towards Hansoo\u2019s pot.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo, who was watching this, chuckled.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry that I couldn\u2019t keep it even for a day, this seems like the end of it Eres.\u2019</p><br/><p>From the way these guys were acting, it seemed like Eres\u2019 will would be hard to keep.</p><br/><p>Since he was closer to Keldian anyway.</p><br/><p>There was a reason why he was closer to him.</p><br/><p>Mihee, who was watching Taesoon walk over towards the circle Hansoo had drawn, suddenly felt a chill spike up from behind her.</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s expression was changing at a rapid rate.</p><br/><p>Well, to be more accurate he was still smiling but the expression was turning scarier as his eyes were changing.</p><br/><p>Deeper and at the same time, colder.</p><br/><p>And Mihee knew instinctively when she saw this.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t angry.</p><br/><p>This was his true nature.</p><br/><p>He had simply been holding down on it until now for some reason.</p><br/><p>She then realized that no matter how selfish Taesoon and the others acted in front of Hansoo they had never blocked his way or disturbed him in any way.</p><br/><p>And Mihee, who had thought up to that point, urgently responded.</p><br/><p>\u201cNO! Don\u2019t come in! Don\u2019t cross that line!\u201d</p><br/><p>But then Taesoon grinded his teeth as he shouted:</p><br/><p>\u201cYou just wait right there.\u201d</p><br/><p>And then Taesoon recklessly crossed the line.</p><br/><p>Translator : Ekdud</p><br/><p>TL Check : KobatoChanDaiSuki</p><br/>\n</div>"}

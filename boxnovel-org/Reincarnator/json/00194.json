A human has some skill. Hahaha! Shall I give 100? No 100 is a bit too little. 500! It should at least be 500! Hahahaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the Akalachias who was watching this peculiar scene started to laugh out loudly.</p><br/><p>Some of the Akalachias laughed along with him from those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha! 500! Isn\u2019t 500 too much?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c500 for just a rat? Then doesn\u2019t it mean that rat was worth 500 humans? You think those rats can handle 500 of these humans?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut since it\u2019s a first 500 seems right. Let\u2019s do 400 from here. No, 400 is too much! Let\u2019s make it 300!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>All the golden birdmen who were fighting in the vicinity started to laugh.</p><br/><p>As if they had forgotten the situation they were in.</p><br/><p>It was obvious.</p><br/><p>Look at the expressions of those rats.</p><br/><p>They had become like this because the neck of one of them had been cut off by a human and it had now become a scene for everyone to see high above.</p><br/><p>\u2018Even if he aimed for an open chance with luck, it\u2019s still nice.\u2019</p><br/><p>Would a Rebeloong only kill 300 humans and die.</p><br/><p>This made it even better.</p><br/><p>The Akalachia\u2019s leader, Pektoril, looked at the human with a content smile.</p><br/><p>If they, the Akalachias, became like that?</p><br/><p>Then it was better to suicide before their necks got cut off from the human\u2019s spear.</p><br/><p>\u2018Haha. That wouldn\u2019t happen.\u2019</p><br/><p>Pektoril decided not to think about useless things as he watched the human in the distance with a content expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood job human! What wish shall I grant you? Runes? No, you wouldn\u2019t need runes. Artifacts? Or women? Shall I give all the humans here to you? Just say it. We\u2019ll grant it to you after we crush those rats. Hahaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>The golden spears hit each other all over Pektoril\u2019s body as the sound rang throughout.</p><br/><p>A scene which happened when he was extremely happy.</p><br/><p>This noise resonated throughout the entire area and entered the people\u2019s ears.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo chuckled from those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere was something I wanted from you actually.\u201d</p><br/><p>And Karhal flinched from those words.</p><br/><p>He knew what it was.</p><br/><p>The tunnel to the underground.</p><br/><p>The tunnel only the High Race who used to live here knew.</p><br/><p>It was clear that this was what Hansoo was going to ask of the Akalachia.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is he\u2026Going to just leave after hearing that?\u2019</p><br/><p>Karhal flinched.</p><br/><p>It wouldn\u2019t be strange from the attitude he had until now.</p><br/><p>Since the amount of those who would die would be astronomical if he failed here.</p><br/><p>People who had been captured and brought here over numerous decades from the villages and the Green Road.</p><br/><p>And there were at least few hundreds of thousands of them here.</p><br/><p>It was still this much after the deaths, injuries and dying after being played around by the Higher Race.</p><br/><p>It was not a low number.</p><br/><p>Actually it was an astronomical number.</p><br/><p>But if he failed here then at least millions of people from the villages and the Green Road would die.</p><br/><p>And then?</p><br/><p>The people coming up from below would continue to get captured and killed.</p><br/><p>Which means the number of casualties would go up to tens of millions.</p><br/><p>That was what Hansoo was trying to accomplish here.</p><br/><p>\u2018Holy god. What kind of burden have you shouldered all by yourself\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Karhal was shocked while counting the numbers.</p><br/><p>Tens of millions.</p><br/><p>Karhal lived in the United States and he had never even touched money at that scale.</p><br/><p>Dollars on the scale of tens of millions.</p><br/><p>Karhal was an ordinary civilian and he had never even touched such an amount.</p><br/><p>No, he hadn\u2019t even touched a hundredth of it which would amount to ten million cents.</p><br/><p>Could the worth of a human only be a single cent.</p><br/><p>He then realized the number of casualties from the failure of this mission.</p><br/><p>Even if hundreds of thousands die here, if he succeeded here then it would be a profit for him.</p><br/><p>A great success.</p><br/><p>Hansoo spoke towards Pektoril.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere was something I wanted to hear from you originally but my thoughts changed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>The clings and clangs coming out from Pektoril\u2019s body stopped from the confusing words.</p><br/><p>Which meant that he had started to feel annoyed.</p><br/><p>Hansoo left behind a single sentence towards Pektoril.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be able to find it if I just kill you all and search the bodies of all these people.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked around the surroundings.</p><br/><p>\u2018Eres. I\u2019ve been next to you too long. If it was Keldian then he would\u2019ve left everyone to die and dealt with the Destruction Jade first.\u2019</p><br/><p>Actually more than anything, he himself was a bit pissed.</p><br/><p>Kuududuk.</p><br/><p>Pektoril mumbled dumbfoundedly as he watched Hansoo grasp the spear.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha. Look at this insolent bastard. You were a rat as well huh.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Pektoril finished speaking.</p><br/><p>Kwaaaaaaaang!</p><br/><p>A giant golden spear slashed the surrounding.</p><br/><p>Slash!</p><br/><p>Kwaduduk!</p><br/><p>The bodies of the humans got split up and broke apart.</p><br/><p>\u201cUaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuuuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>The people around started to freak out from the sudden massacre as they started to back off.</p><br/><p>The Akalachias who were ignoring them up until now had started to attack them, of course they were shocked.</p><br/><p>The Rebeloong\u2019s leader, Kalipso, started to laugh after watching the sudden change in the Akalachia\u2019s actions.</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaaha! Hahaha! Yes! This is right! Damn bugs!\u201d</p><br/><p>His original plan was to decrease the numbers of the humans before they fought.</p><br/><p>Since the humans might attack them after they become a mess from fighting the Akalachias.</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t ignore the numbers of humans.</p><br/><p>But he had feeling a bit uneasy because those proud and brainless bastards were acting stupidly but for them to do the job for him.</p><br/><p>Kalipso stopped laughing, put Pektoril behind him and started to crush the humans.</p><br/><p>Crunch!</p><br/><p>Uuududuk!</p><br/><p>\u201cUaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhuuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Akalachias and Rebeloongs who were fighting each other started to attack the humans near them.</p><br/><p>They only had one thing in their mind.</p><br/><p>To make the insolent bastard regret it.</p><br/><p>In just a moment hundreds of people died out.</p><br/><p>Kalipso looked at this scene contently and shouted towards Hansoo who had yet to put down the spear.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey you bug! How is it? If it wasn\u2019t for you then these guys wouldn\u2019t have died like this right? A single death of our race is heavier than hundreds of thousands of yours! Hahaha! This is all because of you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kalipso\u2019s shout rang throughout the Birdcage.</p><br/><p>The moment people, who were running away from the Rebeloongs and Akalachias, heard that sound and looked at Hansoo.</p><br/><p>Hansoo replied to Kalipso with a cold laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201cTry it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShow me your backs you rat bastards.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>Booom!</p><br/><p>Hansoo flung the head onto the air and then charged onto the nearby Rebeloongs.</p><br/><p>He then smashed the Forked Lightning onto the Rebeloong who was stomping onto other humans.</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>Rebeloong, Galkipos, twisted its body to defend from the sudden assault and used his front teeth to block the attack.</p><br/><p>The extremely hard Rebeloong\u2019s front teeth.</p><br/><p>But the moment it blocked Hansoo\u2019s attack.</p><br/><p>Crack!</p><br/><p>The teeth cracked as it trembled as if it would break apart.</p><br/><p>\u2018How the hell is this bug so fucking strong!\u2019</p><br/><p>Galkipos freaked out after stomping a human.</p><br/><p>This small bug was stronger than an Akalachia.</p><br/><p>The moment Galkipos flinched from the sudden sensation he had never felt up until now.</p><br/><p>Whooosh!</p><br/><p>Hansoo left behind the spear, charged onto the body of Galkipos and then slashed his fingernails ionto Galkipos\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>Crunch!</p><br/><p>\u201cKerekk\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s brute strength, which could even smash apart the walls of the maze, penetrated through the neck and pulled out the spine.</p><br/><p>Hansoo threw down the Rebeloong, whom had died in just an instant, grabbed the Forked Lightning and the Front Teeth from mid air and started to charge towards the next Rebeloong.</p><br/><p>Towards the one who had frozen in place after turning around after hearing the scream from his behind while he was ripping apart a human.</p><br/><p>Kwaaajajajak!</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo soon started to run around from place to place after the Rebeloongs.</p><br/><p>He smashed down with his spear and crushed them with his hands the moment he got close to them.</p><br/><p>Hansoo continued to smash the skulls and pull out the spines while roaring.</p><br/><p>Kwaaduduk!</p><br/><p>Uduk!</p><br/><p>\u201cFucking bastards who play around all the time! You have no mana right now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ududuk.</p><br/><p>Crunch.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you show your back?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKyuaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>Padddduduk.</p><br/><p>\u201cKeep doing it then!\u201d</p><br/><p>He was careful at start but he knew now.</p><br/><p>Since his physical capabilities had caught up.</p><br/><p>There was nothing for him to fear.</p><br/><p>The only thing remaining was battle skill.</p><br/><p>PeopleOnes who trusted in the Satellite Fortress and played games with humans showing their backs to him?</p><br/><p>To him who had fought with opponents who couldn\u2019t even be compared to these things for decades?</p><br/><p>\u2018Fucking pets. I shall show you the true jungle.\u2019</p><br/><p>Uuududuk!</p><br/><p>Hansoo pulled off the head of a Rebeloong, threw it onto the air and laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow many points now? If you calculate 300 points from after the first then 3500 now right? How many points are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo asked while watching the Akalachias and Rebeloongs who had even forgotten about massacring the humans and were backing away.</p><br/><p>Strength was flowing through his entire body.</p><br/><p>Stamina was overflowing.</p><br/><p>His aura exploded out as all his senses woke up to their fullest.</p><br/><p>\u2018Finally I feel as if this whole thing is worth it.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo thought of the conversation he had with his friends in the past.</p><br/><p>\u2018Kill them all? I was going to anyway.\u2019</p><br/><p>The most primitive and overwhelming strength could easily push down every luck, plans and even the masses.</p><br/><p>The Otherworld was such a world.</p><br/><p>A place where a single person could get stronger without limit.</p><br/><p>\u201cKeep chasing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Booom!</p><br/><p>Hansoo roared out loudly as he jumped towards the next Rebeloongs and Akalachias.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Metiron put his ears onto the ceiling and exclaimed out.</p><br/><p>He could tell without seeing it.</p><br/><p>He could feel it.</p><br/><p>Metiron whispered towards the fragment of seven souls within his mind.</p><br/><p>And as if it was replying to Metiron\u2019s words, the fragment of seven souls started to tremble.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

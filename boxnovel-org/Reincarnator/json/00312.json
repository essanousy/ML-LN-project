Try catching this!\u201d</p><br/><p>A bright orb appeared in the hands of the Dark King.</p><br/><p>[Triple Demonic Bullets]</p><br/><p>A regular skill which could be acquired with ease, even in the old Red Zone.</p><br/><p>It had a speedy reload time and was easy to fire, but it could only fire in a straight line and didn\u2019t do much damage.</p><br/><p>It was good enough to use as a probe, but not to deal fatal damage to a person.</p><br/><p>Usually, at least.</p><br/><p>If a normal person used it, that is.</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Thunder and lightning exploded out from the orb.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The orb shot out from the Dark King\u2019s hands, the ruins of the fortress were lifted into the air, and the space around them trembled.</p><br/><p>Dust flew apart in all directions as if a bomb had exploded.</p><br/><p>And through the dust\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014boom! boom! boom! boom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The bright orb smashed apart everything in its path as it continued to rush towards Hansoo.</p><br/><p>It created gales in its wake and turned the stone below it into a river of lava.</p><br/><p>And as the orb made contact with Hansoo\u2019s spear\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>A blinding light exploded outwards.</p><br/><p>The surrounding ruins of the War Fortress turned into dust from the shock wave, and the ground nearby began to sizzle.</p><br/><p>And the Dark King laughed coldly at this scene.</p><br/><p>\u2018Mmm. That spear definitely suits me.\u2019</p><br/><p>He could clearly see it during the explosion.</p><br/><p>The golden spear that was trying its best to disperse the energy.</p><br/><p>Although it had met the wrong owner\u2014in his opinion, anyway\u2014the fact that it could withstand his overflowing energy was something to compliment.</p><br/><p>The Dark King stared at the golden spear in Hansoo\u2019s hands and then looked at the imitation in his own hands with a dissatisfied expression.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014crunch\u2014 </p><br/><p>He split the spear into two.</p><br/><p>Though it was a good spear, it was a spear that could be found anywhere and then merely covered in gold.</p><br/><p>It was too weak to withstand the strength of a transcendent like himself.</p><br/><p>Though he had broken his own weapon during battle, his expression was still bright.</p><br/><p>Since a spear like that wouldn\u2019t help him much in a fight anyway.</p><br/><p>And soon he would be able to gain the real thing.</p><br/><p>\u2018Strength really is the best.\u2019</p><br/><p>In the past.</p><br/><p>He had revered Hansoo.</p><br/><p>The man who had succeeded in terraforming the previous zones into a livable space.</p><br/><p>Though he hadn\u2019t seen Hansoo\u2019s actions in person, he was part of the group that followed right behind Hansoo and Mihee.</p><br/><p>Though he hadn\u2019t seen them personally, Hansoo\u2019s footprints could be felt all over his body as he climbed his way up.</p><br/><p>He felt the might of the World Tree Hansoo had revived in the Red Zone.</p><br/><p>The giant Gragos that Hansoo had succeeded in taming in the Orange Zone.</p><br/><p>Countless Satellite Fortresses that covered the skies in the Yellow Zone.</p><br/><p>And in the Green Zone, he had fought to help Hansoo during the Battle of the War Fortress.</p><br/><p>He had personally seen the hole appear in the sky as the elevators descended and the world transformed.</p><br/><p>He reveled in the footprints of this giant and respected them.</p><br/><p>Respect towards the being that had done things he could not.</p><br/><p>He remembered the stories of those who had seen Hansoo up close, and remembered them during the hard times to keep himself going.</p><br/><p>He\u2019d kept going until the day he could meet the man in his dreams.</p><br/><p>But now.</p><br/><p>With his strength.</p><br/><p>His thoughts had changed.</p><br/><p>\u2018If I had strength, I could\u2019ve done that as well.\u2019</p><br/><p>Kang Hansoo.</p><br/><p>He was stronger than anyone else and had succeeded against any enemy.</p><br/><p>There were some who\u2019d helped him, and those beside him were also quite strong, but in the end, his individual strength had played the biggest role.</p><br/><p>If Hansoo had done it. </p><br/><p>Couldn\u2019t he, who was now even stronger than Hansoo, do it as well?</p><br/><p>\u2018Just wait. I will be the one to lead you guys now.\u2019</p><br/><p>There was a reason why he had spared a group of people, despite having been able to turn them into crystals as well.</p><br/><p>How could a king be a king by himself?</p><br/><p>He needed subjects.</p><br/><p>And the people at his side would now serve the strongest king in history.</p><br/><p>Even stronger than this living legend.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Dark King laughed maniacally and jumped down.</p><br/><p>He could only win.</p><br/><p>There was a clear difference in power.</p><br/><p>The energy absorbed from the sacrifice of tens of thousands of Kang-Kions transformed into skills.</p><br/><p>A skill useful in dealing with small fry, but not really those of similar levels\u2014an immolation type of skill\u2014exploded out from his body.</p><br/><p>[Dark Sun].</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014 </p><br/><p>A dark sun which set everything nearby ablaze rose up from the Dark King\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u201cF***!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRun!\u201d</p><br/><p>The screams of countless adventurers were heard by the Dark King, but he merely ignored them.</p><br/><p>Since those who ran away didn\u2019t have the qualifications anyway.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo, surrounded by golden light, walked out from the dust clouds.</p><br/><p>Though he was covered in dust and minor injuries, he was mostly fine.</p><br/><p>And the Dark King\u2019s expression darkened at this unexpected turn.</p><br/><p>\u2018Though it was just a probe\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>As the Dark King frowned.</p><br/><p>Hansoo also frowned as he spat out\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve waited two years, you guys can\u2019t only be at this level right?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Dark King almost cried at Hansoo\u2019s look of contempt, as if he was not worthy.</p><br/><p>It was similar to those eyes he had seen in the past.</p><br/><p>The eyes of the being that had given him this strength.</p><br/><p>Hansoo was showing him the exact same expression.</p><br/><p>But even before the tears could come out from the Dark King\u2019s eyes\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo moved first.</p><br/><p>He needed to teach a lesson to the Dark King who had fearlessly approached him.</p><br/><p>\u2018You should\u2019ve kept your distance\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014boom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The sound of a huge explosion blasted out from Hansoo\u2019s position as the entire area around him crashed down.</p><br/><p>Using the tremendous earthquake-like shockwaves as momentum, Hansoo\u2019s body shot out like lightning.</p><br/><p>And now dark-gold energy surrounded Hansoo\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>The Reinforcement skill covering Hansoo\u2019s body was no longer translucent.</p><br/><p>It had been compressed to the point of resembling silk.</p><br/><p>Hansoo, covered in the Demonic Dragon Reinforcement, dashed towards the Dark King.</p><br/><p>\u2018...I can block it!\u2019</p><br/><p>The Dark King was shocked for a moment, but then relaxed.</p><br/><p>Since he could clearly see his movements.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t at a level where he couldn\u2019t catch up.</p><br/><p>Not at a level he couldn\u2019t react to.</p><br/><p>Actually, he could even move faster.</p><br/><p>\u2018I shall show you my strength.\u2019</p><br/><p>He wanted to show off.</p><br/><p>The strength he had gained.</p><br/><p>He wanted to smash his opponent apart.</p><br/><p>The Dark King started to burn the Dark Sun around his body with even more fervour.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014whoosh\u2014 </p><br/><p>The Dark King swung his fist with all his might\u2014 </p><br/><p>Towards the tip of Hansoo\u2019s spear.</p><br/><p>\u2018I will show you the difference in our strength!\u2019</p><br/><p>And as his fist swung out\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014booooooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>A fist covered in black flames, and a spear covered in dark-gold silk collided.</p><br/><p>And the Dark King smiled at this scene.</p><br/><p>\u2018I...I can win!\u2019</p><br/><p>His Dark Sun was burning the silk-like reinforcement on the spear.</p><br/><p>Though his opponent\u2019s reinforcement was more compressed than his own, his endless flames still managed to burn through it.</p><br/><p>But as the Dark King\u2019s smile broadened at the sight of the spear bending more and more.</p><br/><p>A change occurred.</p><br/><p>\u2014swoosh!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The silk covering Hansoo\u2019s entire body started to sway and move about.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014whoosh!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The Demonic Dragon Reinforcement covering Hansoo\u2019s entire body started to condense into a single point.</p><br/><p>Towards the the tip of his spear.</p><br/><p>And as the thin silk-like reinforcement focused onto a single point\u2014 </p><br/><p>The Reinforcement started to let out a blinding light in all directions.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u201cUwaaaa!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Dark King freaked out at the scene of his Dark Sun being instantly shredded apart, and quickly retreated.</p><br/><p>Blood gushed out from the fist that had collided with the spear.</p><br/><p>\u2018No...NO! NO WAY\u2019</p><br/><p>The Dark King was extremely confused.</p><br/><p>His opponent was merely a relic of the past.</p><br/><p>He had clearly been lazing around.</p><br/><p>Since the man should\u2019ve been far above in the upper zones.</p><br/><p>With the amount of work he himself had gone through, he couldn\u2019t lose like this.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014boom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>A tremendous amount of energy exploded out from the Dark King\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>He had a dream.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t fall here.</p><br/><p>Though it was a person he\u2019d revered, he could not allow Hansoo to block his path.</p><br/><p>\u2018I...WILL...NOT...LOSE!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014 </p><br/><p>The still-burning remains of the Dark Sun disappeared. </p><br/><p>As well as every other skill in his body.</p><br/><p>Every ounce of power in his body turned into a single skill.</p><br/><p>A skill that the man who had given him this strength had left behind.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>Ten thousand mediocre skills could not defeat a single mastered skill.</p><br/><p>That was why the transcended needed to know how to focus on a single skill.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

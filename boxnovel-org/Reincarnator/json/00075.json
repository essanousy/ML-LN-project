It purposely loosened the Mana Wall.\u2019</p><br/><p>It had gotten rid of the Mana Wall so it would be cut more easily and then tried to hit Hansoo with the speed.</p><br/><p>And as soon as that guy failed it was looking for another chance.</p><br/><p>The marble that had been cut in two had long regenerated.</p><br/><p>Ekidrang looked for another chance as he aggressively pushed in.</p><br/><p>\u2018If you do that then the story changes.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo carefully looked at the marble that was flying towards him.</p><br/><p>And the moment the marble almost reached him, he put away his sword.</p><br/><p>At the same time he stepped on the marble flying towards him and poured in a large amount of strength.</p><br/><p>Boom~</p><br/><p>\u2018Kuhuk.\u2019</p><br/><p>The pain felt like his leg bones were breaking.</p><br/><p>Which meant that it wasn\u2019t quite enough to break his legs.</p><br/><p>If it was covered with mana then they would\u2019ve been smashed apart but that thing had disabled the Mana Wall.</p><br/><p>Hansoo poured more strength into his thigh while stepping on the marble.</p><br/><p>Tududuk.</p><br/><p>At the same time Hansoo\u2019s body quickly rushed towards the Heart.</p><br/><p>Booom!</p><br/><p>The marbles constantly chased Hansoo the flying Hansoo and tried to assault his body but Hansoo barely dodged those attacks as he reached out with Galadriang\u2019s Relic.</p><br/><p>Kwadudududuk.</p><br/><p>A sensation that he had felt like dissecting the cocoon inside the heart of the Calamity Fish could be felt on the edge of the sword.</p><br/><p>Such a hard and large amount of Muscles, Mucus and Ligaments were covering the Central heart.</p><br/><p>A situation where he had to dissect a building that was similar to a bomb shelter.</p><br/><p>But the relic that was in Hansoo\u2019s hand and the relic that was reborn from borrowing the energy from the Divine Stone Fragment was completely different in terms of strength.</p><br/><p>The heart instantly split apart from the golden blade while making ripping noises.</p><br/><p>&lt;!!!!!!!&gt;</p><br/><p>At the same time the heart that was pumping at a regular rate started to pump madly as it was agitated.</p><br/><p>The problem was that it wasn\u2019t the only thing that was agitated.</p><br/><p>The surrounding Elvenheim army also started to change according to the heartbeat.</p><br/><p>Tudududuk.</p><br/><p>Muscles swelled up and the eye, that was out of focused, focused in.</p><br/><p>The ear that was hanging down but had been slightly raised due to the battle now rose up as if it was trying to pierce the heavens.</p><br/><p>And the two Great Tiger Generals who had been leading the Elvenheims were the same.</p><br/><p>Fabien\u2019s body, which was already massive, covered his whole body which had been enlarged a step further with Mana Walls as he charged towards Hansoo.</p><br/><p>Hansoo, who had been fervently slicing apart the heart, felt Fabien\u2019s fist cutting through the air behind him but he did not dodge it.</p><br/><p>Actually he just allowed the attack after tensing up all the muscles on his body.</p><br/><p>Kudududuk.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hu-up!\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo felt his conscious shaking from the fist that felt like it was trying to drive into his body.</p><br/><p>The relic Fabien had was focused on defense unlike Galadriang\u2019s Sword but once the powerful armor combined with his great physical ability, his body basically became a weapon in itself.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo received Fabien\u2019s attack and then straightened his senses.</p><br/><p>He did not die.</p><br/><p>Though his side had been ripped off, that guy had gotten very close.</p><br/><p>\u2018I can\u2019t dissect the Heart with this guy alive!\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo then started to concentrate all of the golden light on the blade.</p><br/><p>The mana that was spreading in all directions from the Relic and the Divine Stone Fragment started to gather onto his blade.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? The mana reinforcement got weaker?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that Hansoo guy okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>The people who had been fighting momentarily flinched when the mana wave suddenly turned weak.</p><br/><p>At that time Hansoo, who had gathered as much mana which was spreading through the Mana Resonance Wave as much as he could, slashed down the golden blade towards Fabien.</p><br/><p>Since it felt like his body was going to explode if he gathered more.</p><br/><p>Chuwaaaaa!</p><br/><p>&lt;!!!!&gt;</p><br/><p>The mana blade that Hansoo had swung cut towards the charging Fabien\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>Kagagagak.</p><br/><p>Though the armor surrounding Fabien\u2019s neck was strong, it was not as strong as the attack Hansoo risked his life for.</p><br/><p>Crack.</p><br/><p>A red line appeared on Fabien\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo frowned.</p><br/><p>\u2018It regenerated that too?\u2019</p><br/><p>Most Elvenheims stopped their movements when you cut off their necks.</p><br/><p>But Fabien\u2019s neck was healing while the armor held the necks in place despite him having cut off his neck.</p><br/><p>\u2018It turns a lifeform into a monster.\u2019</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>As Hansoo was about to move his body in order to end Fabien completely, seven marbles charged at him from the distance at an incredible speed.</p><br/><p>Ekidrang had sent out all the marbles, including the ones protecting his body, after getting nervous from seeing Fabien becoming immobile.</p><br/><p>Hansoo clicked his tongue and then jumped into the heart he was slashing apart.</p><br/><p>Then he madly started to slash his sword in all directions.</p><br/><p>Chaaaaak!</p><br/><p>Ekidrang\u2019s Relic followed Hansoo into the heart and tried to rip Hansoo apart but it could not move like before</p><br/><p>Since the delicate structures might also get destroyed in the process of smashing Hansoo.</p><br/><p>The heart was as big as a small building but it was not big enough for Ekidrang\u2019s marbles, which flew like comets, to act freely.</p><br/><p>Hansoo madly dodged and got hit by the marbles as he started to dig out the insides of the heart.</p><br/><p>&lt;!!!!!&gt;</p><br/><p>The heart filled with more rage as it tried to control more of the Elvenheims to come towards the heart but it was not enough.</p><br/><p>The hole Hansoo had made on the hole was not really big.</p><br/><p>Though he was grinding things up inside, it was not big enough for countless Elvenheims to come in.</p><br/><p>&lt;!!!!\u2026.&gt;</p><br/><p>The heart slowly lost its strength as it got destroyed step by step from the inside.</p><br/><p>Then a change occurred.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese guys became incredibly slow! Create some distance!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t heal anymore! We don\u2019t need to fight them head on! Just assault them from afar!\u201d</p><br/><p>As the energy supply from the heart stopped, the regeneration speed slowed down as well as their movement speeds.</p><br/><p>Hansoo finished off the heart and then quickly ran outside.</p><br/><p>Then he dashed towards Fabien who had almost finished regenerating.</p><br/><p>Chwaaak!</p><br/><p>Fabien tried to resist but he couldn\u2019t move since he needed a greater amount of energy than the others.</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s sword cut off his wrist.</p><br/><p>At the same time the relic that was on his wrist fell off as well.</p><br/><p>The wrist had stronger protection from the armor than the other parts but it couldn\u2019t be sustained after the energy supply had been cut off.</p><br/><p>Hansoo quickly changed the form of the sword as he brought the bracelet that was on the wrist to himself.</p><br/><p>Then he quickly put it on.</p><br/><p>Hoooong!</p><br/><p>The mana that was blazing inside Hansoo as if it wanted to explode quickly calmed down.</p><br/><p>His control over the Divine Stone Fragment had increased much more as the relics increased to two.</p><br/><p>Like insisting that the control didn\u2019t merely multiply by two by having two relics, the powerful mana storm quickly calmed down under Hansoo\u2019s control.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hooh.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo sighed in relief as he saw his mana veins quickly calming down.</p><br/><p>The amount of mana that would be used up would be twice the amount if he were to control both.</p><br/><p>He would be able to supply more mana since having two relics allowed him to control the Divine Stone Fragment with much more ease.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s amazing.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo mumbled inwardly as he saw the mana blade that blew up to the point where it was about to explode.</p><br/><p>It was like his when he had only gathered two.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t even imagine what he would be able to do if he were to collect all 5 relics and attain the complete \u2019s powers.</p><br/><p>Hansoo, who had been looking at the mana that had been pouring all over his body, looked at Ekidrang in the distance having a hard time controlling the 7 beads and then quickly charged towards him.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHoo-ok\u2026 Hoook.\u201d</p><br/><p>Michael looked at the surrounding clansmen as he breathed in and out harshly.</p><br/><p>Though they were all gasping for air from the battle, the battle ended very quickly despite them struggling until now.</p><br/><p>Since the Elvenheim had all lost their strength and fallen down the moment the heart was crushed.</p><br/><p>And one more thing.</p><br/><p>Michael looked at his sword that was shining much brighter than before.</p><br/><p>\u2018A lot more mana is being supplied than before.\u2019</p><br/><p>Michael then looked towards the origin of the cause.</p><br/><p>Seven marbles floating around him, a new bracelet and the sword he previously had.</p><br/><p>He, who had obtained many new things, was a lot different from before.</p><br/><p>The sensation of him pushing his limits could not be felt as the energy that was being sent their way was greatly amplified.</p><br/><p>And around his body, larger fragment pieces than the ones before were floating around his body.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026He reminds be of a Pylon.\u2019</p><br/><p>Memories of a game he used to play a long time ago, Starcraft, came back to him.</p><br/><p>Michael looked at Hansoo and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo laughed as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been to dungeons many time. It\u2019s the same.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Plant has shut down.</p><br/><p>Though a few remaining beasts would still be around and the difficulty of them would still be high but it really wouldn\u2019t be that burdensome since he would be able to control the Divine Stone Fragment with the three relics.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s working out better than I expected.\u2019</p><br/><p>At that time the captain of the shock troopers who was standing next to Michael approached him and whispered something in his ears.</p><br/><p>It seems like he had seen something with a skill.</p><br/><p>Michael\u2019s expression turned grim as he heard this.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that the beasts won\u2019t come out anymore?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Hansoo made a confused expression, Michael spoke with a frozen expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cI checked with the skill because we had gotten closer but\u2026 There\u2019s no need for words. Just see it for yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Michael then transferred the image from the skill of the captain of the search team, , to Hansoo.</p><br/><p>The image of the view the captain of the search him had seen could be seen on the mirror that he was holding.</p><br/><p>A building that had remnants of an explosion but still had a decent look.</p><br/><p>And the beasts that were slowly being recreated inside it.</p><br/><p>Though all the Cultivation Containers weren\u2019t working as if it wasn\u2019t fully healed but from one look one could tell that strong things were being produced.</p><br/><p>And the speed was getting faster as well.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damnit\u2026 Those are things that appear at the end of the dungeon of the Base Root.\u2019</p><br/><p>Michael muttered inwardly.</p><br/><p>Though the Five Calamities were strong, they were plenty of other monstrous things other than them.</p><br/><p>And such things were slowly being produced from the Plant.</p><br/><p>While Michael was making a grim expression, Hansoo also frowned slightly.</p><br/><p>\u2018The Fairy shouldn\u2019t have intervened.\u2019</p><br/><p>It shouldn\u2019t have known that he had come to the past.</p><br/><p>And if it was going to intervene then it would\u2019ve done so in the beginning.</p><br/><p>Since he wouldn\u2019t even have been able to come back to the past if they had intervened at the Crystal in his past life.</p><br/><p>\u2018Did the main body sense and learn the Mana Wave?\u2019</p><br/><p>That was highly likely.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t we need to escape?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo shook his head at Michael\u2019s words</p><br/><p>Though it was a giant beast that looked like it didn\u2019t have much in its brains, it was not stupid.</p><br/><p>It would constantly watch and learn.</p><br/><p>You would not be able to make it fall into the same trap twice.</p><br/><p>He would need to prepare for the Plant even more next time and there would be no way to penetrate through the beasts if the Plant wasn\u2019t shut down.</p><br/><p>\u2018But\u2026 There\u2019s no need to face them all.\u2019</p><br/><p>There was no actual need to fight.</p><br/><p>He needed to buy time since he had obtained the Relic.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you hold onto your breath for a bit?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Michael replied Hansoo pushed the power of the Relic in his hand to the limit.</p><br/><p>Then he slashed at the root around them.</p><br/><p>Booom!</p><br/><p>The line of light that had been strengthened from the Divine Stone Fragment made a hole in the tunnel surrounding them just like that.</p><br/><p>Then toxic waters started to pour out from those locations.</p><br/><p>The Outer Tunnel that sucked in the toxic waters.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we ride this then we\u2019ll get there in an instant.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Michael looked at the tube full of the toxic water that was headed towards an unknown location and made a bitter expression.</p><br/><p>Then he thought to himself.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do we need to take such risks to help that guy?\u2019</p><br/><p>But Michael just shook his head.</p><br/><p>They wouldn\u2019t be able to get out from here only by relying on their own strength, without the relics that guy was holding.</p><br/><p>And that guy didn\u2019t have any thoughts of leaving before he ended this so they had to see the end no matter what happened to them.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damnit. I\u2019ve been caught badly.\u2019</p><br/><p>It had been a long time since he felt the pain of seeing blood once you provoked a dangerous fellow to the bones.</p><br/><p>Michael clenched his teeth and started moving.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The main body was lost in thoughts as it was learning the mana wave that it had sensed inside the Root.</p><br/><p>A power that a strange guy had shown.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t enough to deal with that guy with the beasts it had now.</p><br/><p>&lt;\u2026..&gt;</p><br/><p>It needed a different method.</p><br/><p>Though it was creating beasts for defense but the power it held now was equal to their creator who had created test subjects like them.</p><br/><p>It knew instinctively.</p><br/><p>Why the guy at the sea had gotten quiet.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t know what would happen once that guy were to charge in like this.</p><br/><p>The main body stopped the regeneration of the plant momentarily as it started to focus the energy into a different location.</p><br/><p>To create the clone, , that it hadn\u2019t created up until now because it felt scruples to do so.</p><br/><p>Proofreader\u2019s note</p><br/><p>Regular chapter 1/3.</p><br/><p>Hansoo killed the heart of the Root acting as the Devil\u2019s mouth \u2013 not the heart of the main body.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

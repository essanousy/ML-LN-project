It\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo made a shocked expression as he looked at the man Mudusella greeted.</p><br/><p>\u2018..Tiamet. Was he an Ain?\u2019</p><br/><p>The Tiamet in front of him had the same form as Tiamet a thousand years from now on.</p><br/><p>But the aura of a spirit could clearly be felt.</p><br/><p>The man called TMT-17 that clearly had the trait of an Ain spoke to Mudusella.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you not put that damn number in the back? I just call you Mudusella as well. We\u2019re going to be on the same ship, let\u2019s drop some formalities at least.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to call me by the system\u2019s name just because I manage the system.\u201d</p><br/><p>TMT-17 just shrugged his shoulders.</p><br/><p>TMT series.</p><br/><p>The series with the codename Tiamet was one of the top two series along with the MSL series.</p><br/><p>Of course their objectives were different.</p><br/><p>Though they both used spirits to control the energy, their reason for their creation was clearly different.</p><br/><p>If the Mudusellas were created to manage the Mudusella system that provided humans with the good environment.</p><br/><p>Then the Tiamets were created to get rid the various variables and dangers that may come in the way of humans.</p><br/><p>So their name was Tiamet.</p><br/><p>Those who would protect the humans in the unknown planet Tiamet which was filled with dangers.</p><br/><p>TMT-17 looked at the countless glass tubes below and smirked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m playing guard here but doing the same thing in that damn ship. I\u2019ve got a lot of work to do. I even have to look after those beanheads.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...That\u2019s our job.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s your job. My work is to kill and smash things apart.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...\u201d</p><br/><p>Whilst Mudusella made a disgusted expression.</p><br/><p>Oooooong.</p><br/><p>With a strange noise, an announcement was made in the entire area of the Mudusella was in charge of.</p><br/><p>[In 15 seconds, 3rd grade citizens shall be released into the area of MSL-17]</p><br/><p>[Underground residence\u2026 Beginning energy supply.]</p><br/><p>[To conserve energy, it will only be open from 11:00 to 13:00 today.]</p><br/><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><br/><p>The millions of tubes below Mudusella started to move around.</p><br/><p>Down.</p><br/><p>At the same time.</p><br/><p>Lights came on below the giant tower.</p><br/><p>Tiamet shrugged as he looked at this scene.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll become busy now. I\u2019ll move away for now then. Have fun.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...I won\u2019t be able to see you off.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Really annoying.\u2019</p><br/><p>The spirit spoke towards Mudusella within the silence excitedly.</p><br/><p>But Mudusella shook her head.</p><br/><p>Like Tiamet said, it would only get busier.</p><br/><p>Then, an order came through the chipset.</p><br/><p>From the Akamel she had seen before.</p><br/><p>The orders of Akamel had a hint of maliciousness as well as a bit of expectation.</p><br/><p>The Mudusella System didn\u2019t go on break when the humans did.</p><br/><p>It was the opposite.</p><br/><p>When the 3rd grade citizens are released was the time the Mudusella system performed its most important task.</p><br/><p>As Mudusella breathed in and out.</p><br/><p>Booooom!</p><br/><p>A giant sphere above Mudusella\u2019s head started to spin whilst letting out bright red lights in all directions.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>Underground residence.</p><br/><p>Kiiiiiing!</p><br/><p>With the enhanced race\u2019s energy control, the frozen residences started to come back to live.</p><br/><p>Light filled up the wide area as the flowers, trees and lakes beside the apartments started to brim with life.</p><br/><p>And from the 500m wide tower in the center.</p><br/><p>Chiiiiiiiik!</p><br/><p>The glass tube started to open in order to descend.</p><br/><p>And white gas came out from these tubes.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh! So stiff!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sure this keeps us in top condition?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWoah! 5 days have gone past already!\u201d</p><br/><p>People started to appear one after another.</p><br/><p>And they started to chatter loudly as they started to check on their bodies and their surroundings.</p><br/><p>And soon sounds of complaints could be heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn. Can\u2019t we just live back there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck! We were just about to kill the Red Lava Lizard!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh...Walking after having flown for so long, I really can\u2019t get used to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>And there was an existence who was smirking at these people.</p><br/><p>\u2018Useless.\u2019</p><br/><p>From the highest point of the residential areas.</p><br/><p>Tiamet smirked as he looked down.</p><br/><p>People who had run away from reality.</p><br/><p>People who agreed that it didn\u2019t need to be reality as long as they were satisfied.</p><br/><p>There were no better than livestock.</p><br/><p>A virtual world that was created for those who had decided to give up on changing reality and had ran away.</p><br/><p>\u2018Was it called\u2026 Exodus? What a nice name. Anyways, that Nepallem guy is amazing. He even found a use for these useless things.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tiamet thought up of the virtual world created from the Mudusella system and then smirked.</p><br/><p>But then, a girl came out from between the people.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Astania.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tiamet mumbled the name of the female in the distance in a daze.</p><br/><p>At that moment</p><br/><p>Splat!</p><br/><p>\u201cHow dare you come here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just an obedient dog.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018...Damned bastards.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tiamet frowned inwardly at the citizens who had thrown eggs by his feet.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm...This is making this complicated.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? What do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>Akamel asked in confusion as the man who he had been talking to suddenly mumbled.</p><br/><p>There weren\u2019t many who can ignore Akamel.</p><br/><p>But the man in front of him was an exception.</p><br/><p>This man was special even out of special people.</p><br/><p>The man whom Akamel had been talking to, Nepallem, started to frown.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell. One TMT is looking for a fight in the underground residential areas.\u201d</p><br/><p>Akamel made a shocked expression.</p><br/><p>\u2018This bastard...Why is he over there\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>It would know what would happen once it walked in the crowds of people, why did it go there.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn. This is why it\u2019s always better to get rid of their rights and just use them like dogs. Why did he give them free movement\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>He liked neither the enhanced race nor the 3rd grade citizens.</p><br/><p>\u2018Or maybe we should just treat them like the 2nd grade citizens\u2026.\u2019</p><br/><p>As Akamel mumbled with a cold expression.</p><br/><p>Nepallem got up and started to head somewhere.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go have a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>And this shocked Akamel.</p><br/><p>Though he knew that Nepallem was a hero and a famous being, why would he still go there.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust leave them, we\u2019ll deal with them. Just focus on the plan this time around please.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a reason why Akamel was annoyed.</p><br/><p>There was so many things Nepallem had to do, why did he have to bother with such a menial task?</p><br/><p>\u2018And...It\u2019s tomorrow.\u2019</p><br/><p>In a situation where not a single mistake is allowed, for him to go see one man.</p><br/><p>Nepallem chuckled as he shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a reason why I\u2019m going. He\u2019s\u2026 Really special.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018He\u2019s different from the other TMT series?\u2019</p><br/><p>Akamel looked at Nepallem in confusion but Nepallem just headed down.</p><br/><p>And Akamel clenched his teeth at this scene.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fuck. I don\u2019t like any of these bastards.\u2019</p><br/><p>Akamel thought for a moment then just shook his head.</p><br/><p>Their plan was basically complete anyway.</p><br/><p>It would succeed without Nepallem anyway.</p><br/><p>Akamel started to send messages with a stern expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cBegin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Soon.</p><br/><p>The topmost floor of the Obelisk started to get busy.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

They probably didn\u2019t clean this place up that well.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was just as he said.</p><br/><p>If the area where the humans lived and the area where the Abyssal monsters appeared were in the same place\u2026 </p><br/><p>And there weren\u2019t enough humans to clean them all up\u2026 </p><br/><p>It wouldn\u2019t be weird to find Abyssal monsters in a place where humans didn\u2019t exist.</p><br/><p>\u2018Or the opposite.\u2019</p><br/><p>But then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014R-Korun Nell gave the answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit\u2026 Who would want to live in a place swarming with these things? Those pieces of trash\u2026 For them to let these things roam around here\u2026 The Neropa Union would never let this happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded at R-Korun Nell.</p><br/><p>Those words were correct as well.</p><br/><p>They probably hadn\u2019t expanded their powers up to this point because of all these monsters.</p><br/><p>But Kiriel shrugged her shoulders as she looked to the distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyway\u2026 what shall we do about them? I\u2019m not really into being stalked.\u201d</p><br/><p>R-Korun Nell frowned at her question.</p><br/><p>\u201c... Is someone watching us? Since when?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm. Ever since we arrived? They\u2019re pretending to run away but keep watching us from a distance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>R-Korun Nell was confused.</p><br/><p>Why were these two ignoring those spies?</p><br/><p>Intel was the most important thing in a battle.</p><br/><p>No matter how large your force.</p><br/><p>No matter how many talents you had.</p><br/><p>If they didn\u2019t know what they were going against, but the enemy knew about them?</p><br/><p>Their lives would be in danger.</p><br/><p>That is the battlefield.</p><br/><p>But these two were just leaving those spies alone.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you dealing with them?! You can easily kill them!\u201d</p><br/><p>R-Korun Nell asked.</p><br/><p>He knew that this woman in front of him was a monster.</p><br/><p>She could easily snipe those scouts that were dozens of kilometers away.</p><br/><p>But Kiriel ignored R-Korun Nell and asked Hansoo:</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat shall we do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo shrugged his shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave them alone. They\u2019re probably having a huge headache trying to figure out what to do with us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018We\u2019ll see\u2026 what they really do.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014kacha!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Kyaaaak!</p><br/><p>Hansoo stomped on an Abyssal monster that popped out from beneath the ground and thought.</p><br/><p>These monsters weren\u2019t strong at all.</p><br/><p>But this was more than enough to massacre the people of Reyunion who couldn\u2019t wield the Flame.</p><br/><p>Which meant that there was a Transcendent who was fighting the Abyssal race alongside the people of Reyunion.</p><br/><p>But if so, that brought up another question.</p><br/><p>If the Transcendents existed, and they were in an alliance with the people of Reyunion, why were these monsters still roaming around freely?</p><br/><p>The Transcendents could easily resolve this.</p><br/><p>Which meant one thing.</p><br/><p>\u2018They aren\u2019t really on the friendliest terms. Let\u2019s see what happens.\u2019</p><br/><p>He just needed to do his own job.</p><br/><p>\u2014crunch!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo smashed away another monster charging towards him and continued on his way, all while ignoring the scouts in the distance.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201c...More aliens?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Erunheim frowned.</p><br/><p>There were seven people with the same uniform standing by Erunheim.</p><br/><p>Same uniforms, but each gave out a different impression.</p><br/><p>The seven people, who despite wearing identical outfits, each radiated an aura that was vastly different from the rest.</p><br/><p>But they still had some similarities between them.</p><br/><p>First, they were all leaders of a family, a nation, a union, or a tribe.</p><br/><p>Second, their forces had all been defeated, and they had been forced to escape to this place.</p><br/><p>A man in the corner spoke out.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t they say that no more aliens would come up? Are you sure you checked properly?\u201d</p><br/><p>The scout nodded as he replied:</p><br/><p>\u201cThey could easily smash apart the C-types with just their bare hands. Very, very easily.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...Hmm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone fell silent.</p><br/><p>\u2018They lied\u2026 They told us that no more aliens would come up.\u2019</p><br/><p>Gacherat, the patriarch of the Hun family, thought to himself.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t know the exact details concerning the aliens\u2019 situation.</p><br/><p>They had no way of finding out detailed information about beings that could jump between dimensions.</p><br/><p>But the aliens who held a certain power within their Reyunion territory had often shouted with confidence:</p><br/><p>\u2018Damned bastards\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Gacherat gritted his teeth as he thought of their cocky attitudes.</p><br/><p>Although his situation was grim at this moment, he was once a ruler of a vast territory.</p><br/><p>His family also had fleets that could cut across the skies just as well as the Dragon God Soldiers.</p><br/><p>The family had maintained their survival throughout the thousand-year war\u2014they were not a family that could be made light of by some aliens with meager strength.</p><br/><p>But all of that did not matter in this place.</p><br/><p>Since they couldn\u2019t use the Flame in here.</p><br/><p>But ironically, they were able to keep their lives staying here while escaping from the eyes of the Neropa Union.</p><br/><p>Instead, they placed their lives in the hands of those aliens, receiving their protection.</p><br/><p>Without them, they had no way of dealing with the strange monsters crawling around this place.</p><br/><p>They would be killed off in a month without the aliens.</p><br/><p>But this made them feel more and more uneasy.</p><br/><p>A relationship like this always ended with the destruction of one side.</p><br/><p>Even more so if one side was as cocky and proud as those guys.</p><br/><p>A few days ago, the aliens had almost dragged off a few of his family members into their beds.</p><br/><p>If his daughter hadn\u2019t been a part of that group and he hadn\u2019t stepped up to beg for them, the aliens would have definitely taken them away.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Taking the crystal is one thing, but why must they do this? We have to deal with those guys.\u2019</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t have a method until this point, but a new variable had just appeared. </p><br/><p>And it was clear that Gacherat wasn\u2019t the only one with these thoughts as the other leaders within Reyunion nodded at each other. </p><br/><p>Erunheim also seemed to have sensed this as she said:</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s approach them carefully. Do you all agree?\u201d</p><br/><p>Most of the other aliens were just killing off the monsters while enjoying alcohol and women in a specific location.</p><br/><p>Which meant that if they blocked the eyes of the aliens, they would have no way of realizing that more aliens had appeared.</p><br/><p>That would give them more than enough time to have a discussion.</p><br/><p>\u2018We don\u2019t know how strong the newcomers are, but\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Even if they were weaker than the ones already in Reyunion, it didn\u2019t matter.</p><br/><p>As long as they figured out a weak point or their relationships with other forces, it would give the people of Reyunion a huge advantage.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh\u2026 things were better before those guys left.\u201d</p><br/><p>One person thought back to the day when the aliens had split up and left.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, we didn\u2019t have a shred of hope back then\u2026 But at least we have something now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone nodded.</p><br/><p>A tiger could not be dealt with.</p><br/><p>But a fox pretending to be a king after the tiger has left could be dealt with.</p><br/><p>Soon\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014the leaders of Reyunion all split up and started sending messages to their families and people.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, nothing is happening?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm\u2026 Well. Good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Erunheim got annoyed at the man\u2019s casual attitude and said:</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? I told them to deal with it, but I guess they didn\u2019t. Alright. I\u2019ll go over and deal with them properly today.&gt;</p><br/><p>&lt;...&gt;</p><br/><p>Erunheim was at a loss at his response, and she clenched her teeth and turned off the screen.</p><br/><p>The man scoffed as he looked to the person next to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re treating us like idiots, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man standing by the side nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamned bastards.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man scoffed.</p><br/><p>Even monkeys knew about the importance of intel in a battle.</p><br/><p>Why would they leave every eye and ear to those guys?</p><br/><p>There was a reason why he didn\u2019t personally gather intel.</p><br/><p>There was no need to.</p><br/><p>\u2014pazzzzk\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A body destroyed from torture.</p><br/><p>The machinery parts inside his body had long been destroyed as well.</p><br/><p>The man looked at the woman beneath him and chuckled.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really is a nice place. Nobody notices when a person disappears.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reason they left some monsters alone wasn\u2019t because they were lazy.</p><br/><p>But rather, it was convenient for them to exist.</p><br/><p>\u2018Even if a person disappears, we can just say the monsters killed them.\u2019</p><br/><p>Why would there be a reason for him to gather intel?</p><br/><p>When he could just kidnap someone who already collected the intel?</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see\u2026 Turn it on. You have something you saved up, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The woman hurriedly moved her hands and activated the machine before her eyes.</p><br/><p>Although it had a secure lock and the aliens couldn\u2019t even figure out how to use it.</p><br/><p>Although she had received countless training for various tortures and had hardened her mind.</p><br/><p>These guys were different.</p><br/><p>\u2018Beasts\u2026 Monsters\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>The scout, Kamel, hurriedly turned on the machine as she stared at the man who seemed to have crawled through hell.</p><br/><p>Soon\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014chiiijijiik\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014the machine crackled as it played a video.</p><br/><p>Displaying the clear faces of two men and a woman.</p><br/><p>And the man\u2019s expression quickly changed at this sight.</p><br/><p>Confusion at first.</p><br/><p>To disbelief.</p><br/><p>And then joy.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha! Nice! Kang Hansoo! You didn\u2019t go up? Hahahaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Sangjin, the man you spent so long searching for\u2026 he\u2019s right here!\u2019</p><br/><p>Although his body was different, how could one not know about Hansoo?</p><br/><p>That blinding being.</p><br/><p>The man laughed as he spoke to his underling.</p><br/><p>\u201cFocus on gathering the crystal! I need to go somewhere!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Flames shrouded the man\u2019s body, and he disappeared.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

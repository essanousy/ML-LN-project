Just stop. You\u2019ve worked hard enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>It remembered the things it had heard about Hansoo from its old ally, Clementine.</p><br/><p>Kang Hansoo.</p><br/><p>The savior of humankind.</p><br/><p>In a world divided into seven zones, he had flipped that very world upside down and restructured them as he climbed up.</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s actions weren\u2019t so different from what he had done in the past.</p><br/><p>\u2018It seems he and I cannot co-exist.\u2019</p><br/><p>Melchizedek chuckled.</p><br/><p>Hansoo had to bring peace to this place, and it had to take this place to war.</p><br/><p>Their goals were different, so they had to fight.</p><br/><p>But the situation now was a bit different.</p><br/><p>That had only been the case if Hansoo had the ability to change reality.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yeah, not anymore.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014booooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Melchizedek thought as it looked at Hansoo who was continuing to struggle even as he listened to it.</p><br/><p>Break this reality, and dream of the infinite possibilities beyond.</p><br/><p>Anyone trapped in a reality they didn\u2019t like had all dreamt of such a thing before.</p><br/><p>Especially if it was a reality that was cruel and unfair.</p><br/><p>Wanting to change it was a normal course of thought.</p><br/><p>Except Hansoo had a clearer vision than others and had the abilities to actually make it happen.</p><br/><p>But not anymore.</p><br/><p>It was finally time for him to face the cruel reality, the cold wall that stood in front of everyone.</p><br/><p>The giant wall that caused countless people to fall into despair, something that caused such people to give up on their current dreams and find a more suitable path for themselves.</p><br/><p>The fact that he had done very well up until this point made him stand out from the others, but it was time for him to make a different choice as well.</p><br/><p>He had met a wall called Melchizedek.</p><br/><p>So then\u2026 </p><br/><p>Once he realizes that he won\u2019t be able to meet his vision anymore, wouldn\u2019t he then act like everyone else?</p><br/><p>Like everyone else who decided to live with this reality.</p><br/><p>Melchizedek thought up to this point and continued to speak:</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it time for you to rest now? Work under me. If you stand next to me, then I promise I\u2019ll support you with everything I can. And once we\u2019ve conquered everything, I\u2019ll allow you to sit upon a higher position over there and give you the rights to control everyone. Isn\u2019t that enough?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Pompeion Empire.</p><br/><p>Neropa Union.</p><br/><p>All the power and control they currently possessed.</p><br/><p>He would be able to grasp a power that no human could even dream about; power that would allow him to fulfill any desires he had.</p><br/><p>A proposition that anybody would accept.</p><br/><p>And Melchizedek\u2019s expression turned into that of anticipation.</p><br/><p>\u2018Accept it.\u2019</p><br/><p>It had felt regret that someone like Kang Hansoo had been killed off in the past, but now there was something else added on top of it now.</p><br/><p>It wanted to see Hansoo accept this offer.</p><br/><p>It wanted to see Hansoo bend.</p><br/><p>It wanted to see Hansoo, whose determination was so unyielding it was blinding, accept this reality and become a normal human being.</p><br/><p>And this was the most important point.</p><br/><p>The thing that was causing him to be so blinding was not his strength.</p><br/><p>No matter how strong or beautiful a blade was, it was nothing more than a piece of metal once it hung on a wall.</p><br/><p>A blade\u2019s fame did not originate from that.</p><br/><p>It originated not from its materials but from what it had cut.</p><br/><p>And it was the same for Hansoo.</p><br/><p>The thing that made him shine so much was not his strength but his goal and conviction.</p><br/><p>No matter how strong he was, if his faith were to break then that light would also disappear.</p><br/><p>If his faith, that which had driven all his actions up until now, were to break then he would become something it wanted him to become.</p><br/><p>So Melchizedek felt anticipation.</p><br/><p>It wanted to see him break down.</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014 </p><br/><p>Nelkipa didn\u2019t even attack him anymore as if it was giving him time to make a choice.</p><br/><p>It would allow him to rest and heal up, but Melchizedek was more than happy enough to give him this brief moment.</p><br/><p>Hansoo chuckled and spoke as he stood on top of the calm surface of Nelkipa.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat an evil taste.\u201d</p><br/><p>Melchizedek flinched.</p><br/><p>It felt like its inner thoughts had leaked out.</p><br/><p>But it was too late to back down.</p><br/><p>Melchizedek continued to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad offer for you, right? If you can keep your friends alive, then\u2026 isn\u2019t that good? Your friends are probably in a bad situation as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Angkara would turn into a sea of flames.</p><br/><p>He and his two comrades would be able to live good lives.</p><br/><p>And that wasn\u2019t all.</p><br/><p>Although the countless humans coming afterward would die, but Transcendents like him would be able to survive.</p><br/><p>And they would all gather under Hansoo\u2019s command.</p><br/><p>\u2018And Clementine is already doing that.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo thought to himself as he listened to Melchizedek's words.</p><br/><p>\u2018Giving up now\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>That was the easier choice for him.</p><br/><p>As their leader\u2026 </p><br/><p>If he kept his life and climbed up with strong people who listened to him well.</p><br/><p>Leaving behind all the weaklings and only taking the useful ones.</p><br/><p>It would be great for him too.</p><br/><p>But he couldn\u2019t do it.</p><br/><p>\u2018My life is not my own.\u2019</p><br/><p>He thought of the past.</p><br/><p>The past.</p><br/><p>Numbers and strength.</p><br/><p>Nothing was enough.</p><br/><p>Countless people had been killed off like bugs in the battlefield called the Abyss.</p><br/><p>What of their sacrifices then?</p><br/><p>Their sacrifices just to send him back in time.</p><br/><p>The remaining ten thousand humans had given up their lives for this.</p><br/><p>And their sacrifice was not so he could stay happy all by himself.</p><br/><p>It was so that the people precious to them would have another chance at life.</p><br/><p>Everyone had similar thoughts as they sacrificed themselves.</p><br/><p>This was why his life wasn\u2019t his own.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou speak too much. I\u2019ve been able to rest thanks to you, so I\u2019ll go easy on you when I beat you up later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Melchizedek\u2019s expression turned icy cold as he stared at Hansoo grasping his hammer tightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems\u2026 this is it.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Melchizedek muttered\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014kaduk!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014the calm surface of Nelkipa started moving chaotically again as it charged towards Hansoo.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014kuooooong!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014the spikes that rose dozens of kilometers into the air started emitting sounds as thousands of tiny blue bubbles appeared on top of those spikes.</p><br/><p>A tremendous amount of energy.</p><br/><p>\u2014kiiiiiing\u2014 </p><br/><p>Nelkipa\u2019s cannons, which were now filled to the brim with the energy from the blue sun inside Nelkipa, aimed towards Angkara in the distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you don\u2019t like it\u2026 you won\u2019t be able to escape the war.\u201d</p><br/><p>Melchizedek looked between Hansoo and the Nelkipa\u2019s cannons and mumbled expressionlessly.</p><br/><p>The moment those cannons fired\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014the existences on Angkara that weren\u2019t attacking Nelkipa seriously because of their internal strife would then realize\u2026 </p><br/><p>How dangerous Nelkipa is.</p><br/><p>And from that point on, they won\u2019t even have time to care about each other.</p><br/><p>The Pompeion Empire and the Neropa Union would stop at nothing to break Nelkipa apart.</p><br/><p>They would use everything to attack and stop it.</p><br/><p>Of course, Melchizedek was still confident that it would win even if that happened.</p><br/><p>It was more than confident enough to withstand all those attacks and smash them apart with this Nelkipa.</p><br/><p>But what of the humans that would come up afterward?</p><br/><p>Would they be able to withstand the flames?</p><br/><p>The flames hidden inside Angkara, the flames bestowed onto their powerful army?</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ll let you know what regret is, Kang Hansoo. How dare you reject my offer?\u2019</p><br/><p>Melchizedek thought without expression.</p><br/><p>It had thought it wouldn\u2019t feel bad even if Hansoo denied its offer, but it had felt more anger than it expected.</p><br/><p>So its plan changed.</p><br/><p>It would have killed him off cleanly, but its thoughts changed.</p><br/><p>To give him as much mental pain as possible, it would keep him alive.</p><br/><p>And while keeping him alive, it would show him everything that would happen from this point.</p><br/><p>The deaths of countless humans that it would kill off like tiny insects.</p><br/><p>\u2018And\u2026 let\u2019s see if you can stay sane while you watch them all die.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll first show you the pain your friends will have to suffer! It seems you treat your life as worthless, but\u2026 would your friends think the same? It\u2019s your two friends right after you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>But as Melchizedek shouted at Hansoo, a change occurred.</p><br/><p>\u2014oooooong!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The cannons that were gathering energy in the distance had started to turn off one by one.</p><br/><p>And at the same time, the Nelkipa started to lose its momentum in attacking Hansoo.</p><br/><p>Like a weapon being turned off.</p><br/><p>\u2018What the hell?!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014sssss\u2014 </p><br/><p>Even his throne had disappeared.</p><br/><p>Melchizedek stood up and clenched its teeth.</p><br/><p>All of Nelkipa\u2019s weapons that it had turned on were turning off.</p><br/><p>But as Melchizedek was about to look into why that was happening\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014tonkonkonk!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014Hansoo hammered away a few of the now-weakened spears and looked towards the distance as if he had somewhat guessed what had happened.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Kiriel. Enbi Arin.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked towards their directions with an expression that hid a hint of sadness, but then replied to Melchizedek:</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all risking our lives here. You\u2026 you should also do the same.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014booooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s body quickly charged towards Melchizedek in the distance.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The giant crystal that Ares Valentine was trying to blow up.</p><br/><p>A woman stood before the sub-crystal that controlled the weapon system.</p><br/><p>Of course, her situation wasn\u2019t quite the best.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaa\u2026 haaa..\u201d</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin, who was completely covered from head to toe in blood, touched her crystal and was focusing.</p><br/><p>The posture was similar to what Ares Valentine had done when he was trying to blow up the crystal, but her actions were vastly different.</p><br/><p>If the energy had grown chaotic when Ares Valentine poured in energy, the energy right now was slowly calming down.</p><br/><p>And she heard a weak voice coming from behind her. </p><br/><p>\u201cYou crazy girl\u2026 You\u2019ll die at this rate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ares Valentine walked over weakly and spoke in a tired voice.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t look any better than Enbi Arin.</p><br/><p>His armor had long been broken apart, and the longsword had been cut in half.</p><br/><p>Ares Valentine looked at Enbi Arin while doing his best not to fall to the ground in a dumbfounded manner.</p><br/><p>\u2018...To try to control that.\u2019</p><br/><p>Of course, that was the reason why he was still alive.</p><br/><p>If Enbi Arin hadn\u2019t run off to stop the crystal then he would\u2019ve been killed.</p><br/><p>But that\u2019s not something a human can control.</p><br/><p>If that was something that was so easily controllable, then he would have chosen to do that as well.</p><br/><p>Although she was suppressing it now\u2026 sooner or later she would lose her life.</p><br/><p>From the reaction of the crystal resisting her suppression.</p><br/><p>The energy inside her body would go haywire.</p><br/><p>And from Ares Valentine\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wish\u2026 my dreams hadn\u2019t ended as dreams.\u201d</p><br/><p>If she gave up now, then those scenes would eternally remain inside her head.</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin clenched her teeth as she focused on the crystal.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

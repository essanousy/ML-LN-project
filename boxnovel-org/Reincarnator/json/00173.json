Will you be okay without any?\u201d</p><br/><p>Karhal made a depressed face while thinking of the Artifacts and runes whom they had sent away along with those who left.</p><br/><p>Runes and gears which came out after they killed the traitors.</p><br/><p>And the weapons that were hidden inside the Armory of the village.</p><br/><p>Why did Hansoo evenly distribute all of these things?</p><br/><p>Of course Hansoo, Ekidu and Karhal had received the runes and artifacts as well.</p><br/><p>The problem was it was fair.</p><br/><p>According to how much they had contributed.</p><br/><p>Of course Hansoo received the most amount of runes because he did most of the work but it was still a small amount.</p><br/><p>There weren\u2019t that many runes that dropped from killing people anyway and there was a lot more who had fought with them instead.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hmm\u2026 Would he be around 50% now?\u2019</p><br/><p>The runes of Hansoo, which should\u2019ve been around 10%, would now be around 50%</p><br/><p>But Karhal was depressed from this.</p><br/><p>Since people who would go with him being stronger was always the best.</p><br/><p>\u2018It would\u2019ve been a lot of help if he took everything.\u2019</p><br/><p>Karhal made a sulky expression and complained.</p><br/><p>Even if Hansoo had said he would take everything, there wasn\u2019t anyone who would have said otherwise.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo shook his heads.</p><br/><p>\u201cStrength is a necessity for those who have left.\u201d</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t treat Refugees well anyway.</p><br/><p>And if they were people who came from other villages, they would be extremely pressured.</p><br/><p>If they were weak in such a situation as well then what would they be able to do?</p><br/><p>They would be busy even saving their own lives.</p><br/><p>The runes were secondary but there was a need for them to be armed well with the powerful artifacts.</p><br/><p>And in reality, the Artifacts of the guards, the Hunters and the Farmers had been risen by an average of two to three levels.</p><br/><p>Since as strong as the traitors were, their artifacts were amazing as well.</p><br/><p>Not much to say for the weapons stored in the Armory as well.</p><br/><p>And with the runes, they wouldn\u2019t have much of a problem acting around in the villages.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh. If you take away 50% of your runes and spread it among thousands of people, would it even make a difference for them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded at Karhal\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>The second attack was always the most important one.</p><br/><p>\u2018I cannot leave behind any embers of trouble.\u2019</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a problem at the percentage of distribution but rather the importance of priority.</p><br/><p>Hansoo filling up his runes to 100% and then distributing it.</p><br/><p>Or distributing it fairy from the very beginning.</p><br/><p>There was a huge difference between the two.</p><br/><p>There was a reason why the leaders of a animal pack ate last.</p><br/><p>\u2018Such an issue will grow inside their minds and become cancerous.\u2019</p><br/><p>The reason for the dams falling wasn\u2019t because of a giant boulder or the flow of the river.</p><br/><p>Just a small crack that appeared on the dam.</p><br/><p>It was all because of this crack.</p><br/><p>As this crack got bigger the dam fell.</p><br/><p>Once the people left, they would constantly remember while enduring the harsh environments of the village.</p><br/><p>The unfair treatment they had received before they had left.</p><br/><p>Depending on how well they were able to fool the traitors by hiding the villagers in the other villages, the people living in over a hundred villages may become allies or enemies when they start fighting against the Higher Race.</p><br/><p>Since the traitors had a large amount of power in those villages.</p><br/><p>Look at Karim, nobody suspected him being the manager of the village.</p><br/><p>If those villagers who had left were agitated like this then the humans, who should\u2019ve become allies, would become enemies instead during the war against the Higher Race.</p><br/><p>This was why he had to treat those people who had left well.</p><br/><p>Hansoo didn\u2019t want to risk such a thing for just 50% of his runes.</p><br/><p>\u2018I can always earn more runes later.\u2019</p><br/><p>There were plenty of chances on the path towards the Green Road.</p><br/><p>But Karhal continued to make a sulky expression, as if something was on his mind, as he spoke out:</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026One important thing hasn\u2019t been solved yet. What are you going to do with the Satellite Fortress?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ekidu nodded at Karhal\u2019s words</p><br/><p>Since it was a clear problem that was extremely important and one that needed to be dealt with.</p><br/><p>And they didn\u2019t know where the Destruction Jade was hidden anyway.</p><br/><p>They would need to go through all the forces of Clementine and search for the hints.</p><br/><p>But as a clash was inevitable, it would definitely get caught in the eye.</p><br/><p>They might\u2019ve been able to do something if it was a human being but the Satellite Fortress was a bit too much.</p><br/><p>Once the assault of light approaches from above, everything would end.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t thinking that it wouldn\u2019t take that long right.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was a reckless plan no matter how they saw it.</p><br/><p>How did they even think that they wouldn\u2019t get caught in the territory of their enemies?</p><br/><p>Hansoo shook his head at Karhal\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll make it so they won\u2019t even care about us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo pointed towards the Satellite Fortress floating up above, the Atillan.</p><br/><p>Karhal made an uneasy expression while watching Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey\u2026 You aren\u2019t thinking of playing a 1945 arcade game while riding that thing right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fighting against tens of Satellite Fortresses with just a single Satellite Fortress?</p><br/><p>No matter how amazing Hansoo was, it was pushing it a bit too far.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what game it is but it isnt that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo hadn\u2019t taken over the Atillan in order to do something with it anyway.</p><br/><p>But would he have gotten it for no reason?</p><br/><p>It was now time to use it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to the mana crystal refinery depository.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What?\u201d</p><br/><p>Karhal and Ekidu surprisingly knew what the mana crystal depository was.</p><br/><p>Since it was very clearly marked on Dakidus\u2019 map.</p><br/><p>Marked as a special military facility.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the\u2026 Are you just going to commit suicide ?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo shook his heads at Karhal\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u2018I need to deal with the Examiners no matter what happens.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Rumble</p><br/><p>At one side of the giant jungle.</p><br/><p>A giant power-plant-looking building which towered over a kilometer was standing in this location.</p><br/><p>It was located in a rather rural location far from the cities where the Arukons lived in but it wasn\u2019t placed in this isolated location because its importance was low.</p><br/><p>Mana crystal refinery and storage.</p><br/><p>Probably one of the top three most important structures/locations that were needed to sustain the race.</p><br/><p>A tremendous amount of fuel, mana crystals, were needed in order to activate the Atillan.</p><br/><p>And the mana crystals were a very important material for the three races as well.</p><br/><p>Since the reason for them fighting each other was to try to gain just a bit more of this mana crystal out of the limited amount that existed so they could continue their civilization.</p><br/><p>The mana crystals came out from the spring which existed in each of the three race\u2019s capital, , and got supplied all over the battlefield.</p><br/><p>The capital was obvious but the four mana crystal refinery depository were also being protected tightly.</p><br/><p>And the tens of Satellite Fortresses that patrolled their boundaries got supplied with the mana crystals from these refinery depositories as they were constantly on guard against the other races.</p><br/><p>And this refinery depository was even more important out of all four.</p><br/><p>It was a very important structure which supplied the Satellite Fortresses which were in charge of the area which bordered both Akalachias and Rebeloongs.</p><br/><p>Of course the Defenders who were in charge of this place needed to stay alert all the time as well.</p><br/><p>And one of these Defenders, Ortanion, looked at the Satellite Fortresses in the distance as he started to frown.</p><br/><p>\u2018For the damn bird and rat bastards to come.\u2019</p><br/><p>The Satellite Fortresses he could see were not those of the Arukons.</p><br/><p>It was the opposite.</p><br/><p>They were the Satellite Fortresses of those who constantly longed after their resources, the Rebeloongs and Akalanchias.</p><br/><p>Though four Satellite Fortresses were protecting them, there was no time for a break.</p><br/><p>No, the fact that four Satellite Fortresses had been sent over to this location out of the vast border simply described how important and dangerous this place was.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn\u2026 It\u2019 would\u2019ve been better to get chosen as a Harvester. Or even an Inspector.\u2019\u2019</p><br/><p>Captain of the Satellite Fortress, the Atillan.</p><br/><p>Out of the tens of thousands of Arukons, it was an honorable position that only a few tens could reach.</p><br/><p>Not everyone could own these positions and being able to hold these positions signified tremendous honor and power.</p><br/><p>A rank that every Arukon wanted.</p><br/><p>But of course there was a difference wherever one went and not every captain of the Atillan was the same.</p><br/><p>The position which was sought after the most was the Harvester.</p><br/><p>It was good.</p><br/><p>It was too good.</p><br/><p>Since they don\u2019t do anything.</p><br/><p>They just needed to rotate around the livestock, eat up some snacks as they pleased and even watch the amusing games that occur in those farms.</p><br/><p>A position of their dreams that every Arukon wanted.</p><br/><p>And this position had been taken over by Dakidus.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damned bastard.\u2019</p><br/><p>He suddenly felt annoyed as he thought of Dakidus laughing as if he had gained everything in the world after being nominated as a Harvester.</p><br/><p>\u2018I hope he becomes a cripple.\u2019</p><br/><p>Of course he knew that wouldn\u2019t happen.</p><br/><p>To get hurt by livestock.</p><br/><p>A captain of the Satellite Fortress?</p><br/><p>If one went through such humiliation then they would get ignored even among their own race.</p><br/><p>The next best one was being an Inspector.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t as good as the Harvester but it was still good.</p><br/><p>Since the only thing they did was inspect the Green Road.</p><br/><p>Finding the Destruction Jade also a part of their tasks but they had long given up on that.</p><br/><p>Since the humans might use it the moment they detect suspicious movements from the Higher races.</p><br/><p>At least the Green Road was their land.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t easy to do anything they wanted in that part where quite powerful livestock existed.</p><br/><p>And that actually made it more favorable.</p><br/><p>Since there wasn\u2019t much to do.</p><br/><p>It was a bit annoying from the fact that they had to deal with Clementine\u2019s underlings and their captain, Metion, but it was still very comfortable.</p><br/><p>And Merutt had been nominated for this.</p><br/><p>That guy was probably roaming around the Green Road in the distance as well.</p><br/><p>Since it wasn\u2019t that far from here.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn. The Harvester and the Inspector\u2026 they need to get abolished.</p><br/><p>Sadly there were only one spot for each of those positions.</p><br/><p>So naturally everyone else would become Defenders.</p><br/><p>He had been nominated to do the least favorable Defender position at the furthest border away from the capital.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t a single time to rest either.</p><br/><p>The Satellite Fortresses had to even take turns in order to resupply their mana crystals.</p><br/><p>Since they didn\u2019t know what the enemy would do the moment a gap was created.</p><br/><p>Though there wasn\u2019t a single Arukon Warrior in the Satellite Fortress of the Harvester or that of the Inspector, there were anywhere from a few tens to hundreds of Arukons in a Satellite Fortress operated by a Defender.</p><br/><p>In case something happened.</p><br/><p>And it was the same for their enemies.</p><br/><p>Which meant that the situation here was that tense.</p><br/><p>\u2018Rumblee\u2019</p><br/><p>Booooooom</p><br/><p>Ortanion frowned as he heard the loud noise coming from below.</p><br/><p>Which meant that the recharging of the mana crystal for the Satellite Fortress from the mana crystal refinery depository had almost finished.</p><br/><p>It was now time to return to the battlefield.</p><br/><p>\u2018Merutt, shall I go have a look at what he\u2019s doing?\u2019</p><br/><p>It would be quite boring until he would comeback.</p><br/><p>But there was a good thing about being in an area of constant clash.</p><br/><p>Because there were a lot of Satellite Fortresses gathered, he could see what was going on with the others in other Satellite Fortresses.</p><br/><p>Chaararararak</p><br/><p>As the detection system of the Satellite Fortress got amplified, he started to zoom in to the Satellite Fortress of the Inspector, Merutt.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hoh? So is that the soccer those humans play?\u2019</p><br/><p>Booom!</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>That Merutt was kicking something into a goal in a part of the Fortress.</p><br/><p>But if people saw this, they would think that the Arukons were hugely mistaken.</p><br/><p>Since it was completely different from the normal soccer.</p><br/><p>Soccer was not something someone played alone and it wasn\u2019t just about kicking the ball into the goal.</p><br/><p>And they did not, under no circumstances no matter what, used a person instead of a ball.</p><br/><p>A person whose limbs had been cut off.</p><br/><p>Booooom!</p><br/><p>Screams and shouts came out from the mouths of the livestock whose limbs had been cut off and only their body and head had been left.</p><br/><p>These people, who were being kicked by the powerful Arukon, were smashing into the walls of the Satellite Fortress which was covered in a blue light and were getting smashed apart.</p><br/><p>Crushed and blown apart.</p><br/><p>There were over 50 that had blown apart under Merutt\u2019s feet already.</p><br/><p>Ortanion was envious as he looked at this scene.</p><br/><p>\u2018This envy is going to be the death of me.\u2019</p><br/><p>Since Merutt always pulled up toys from the Green Road, the number of Offerings was quite high.</p><br/><p>The same with the Harvester, Dakidus.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t really have enough to play around like that since they were only supplied a small amount as snacks.</p><br/><p>But while Ortanion was watching this scene in jealousy.</p><br/><p>Whoooosh</p><br/><p>\u2018Huh? Why has he come already\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Dakidus\u2019s Satellite Fortress.</p><br/><p>Why did his Satellite Fortress come here already when he should be going around the farms right now?</p><br/><p>There still should be a few more days worth of mana crystals.</p><br/><p>\u2018Suspicious.\u2019</p><br/><p>Ortanion made a confused expression at the single Satellite Fortress approaching slowly from the distance as he started up the communications network.</p><br/><p>So they could begin an exchange.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

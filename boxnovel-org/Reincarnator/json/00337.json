It\u2019ll be trouble if it collapses!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStrengthen the formations as well! We need to block the Kang-Kion\u2019s attacks!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKeep the boundaries clear between each living area! It becomes difficult to check if they get mixed!\u201d</p><br/><p>Countless adventurers had gathered near the elevator and were re-building the city.</p><br/><p>They raised walls, set up living areas, and treated the wounded.</p><br/><p>Though everybody was moving around non-stop due to the sheer amount of work that had to be done, there was a hint of vigor in each other\u2019s expressions.</p><br/><p>This was because most of these people had been slaving under those twelve people who\u2019d called themselves \u2018Gods\u2019.</p><br/><p>But now, that horrible life had ended.</p><br/><p>They had gained their freedom.</p><br/><p>But their joy was tinged with sadness and regret.</p><br/><p>Their present safety only reminded them of their dead comrades and family.</p><br/><p>Ekidu and Karhal both looked somber as they watched these people.</p><br/><p>\u2018...If we hurried just a bit more, we would\u2019ve been able to save much more.\u2019</p><br/><p>But they soon brushed those thoughts aside.</p><br/><p>It was good that everything had settled down.</p><br/><p>All they needed to do was set up the 4th zone, just like the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd zones below.</p><br/><p>There was still an issue, though.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do about the transcendents?\u201d</p><br/><p>Karhal asked.</p><br/><p>According to what he knew, the 1st ,2nd, and 3rd zones below were holding back from creating new transcendents.</p><br/><p>It was because the beasts in the lower zones gave a lower amount of crystals, so transcendents would take as many crystals as it would take to send hundreds of thousands of people up.</p><br/><p>Plus, they had no way to control those transcendents as well.</p><br/><p>It was better to keep on sending them up the moment the crystals were acquired.</p><br/><p>But in this zone, the story was a bit different.</p><br/><p>The Green Zone was a good place to create transcendents, plus they knew the higher zones were currently in bad situations.</p><br/><p>\u2018We\u2019ll need their strength, but\u2026 they might all turn into power-hungry maniacs.\u2019</p><br/><p>Karhal frowned after he spoke.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo chuckled.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s check out the zone above first. You\u2019ve all seen it already, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiriel, Ekidu, and Karhal nodded.</p><br/><p>Yes, Hansoo had guessed it right.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026 But back then, we were forced to go down.\u2019</p><br/><p>Karhal breathed in and out, thinking back to the past when they\u2019d run back down.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2014boooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u201cCrazy bastards!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang Han, the man who had been residing on the 3rd floor of the 4th zone, screamed as he blocked the attacks flying at him.</p><br/><p>At first he was full of glee when he had seen the four men and two females who\u2019d come up.</p><br/><p>Since four of them had looked familiar.</p><br/><p>Two were kids who had tried to devour the 2nd floor below, and the other two had been beaten down by him before.</p><br/><p>He remembered the two who he\u2019d beaten.</p><br/><p>Karhal and Ekidu.</p><br/><p>Two people who he\u2019d fought with and had sent back down.</p><br/><p>Though it had been a close victory, he had still won.</p><br/><p>The upper floor had more powerful beasts that gave more crystals, and the efficiency of the nursery was better here.</p><br/><p>The lazy kids of the lower floors were people he should be able to beat with ease.</p><br/><p>Or at least, he thought he would.</p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Kang Han clenched his teeth at the tremendous impact of Karhal\u2019s attack.</p><br/><p>\u2018What the\u2026 this makes no sense! I should be stronger!\u2019</p><br/><p>There were six of them as well, but the other five weren\u2019t even doing anything.</p><br/><p>He\u2019d won against the two back then, but now, even fighting against one was hard.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn, I cannot lose!\u2019</p><br/><p>How could he beat six when he couldn\u2019t even beat one?</p><br/><p>But he couldn\u2019t get captured like this.</p><br/><p>He realized it the moment he saw the two people who controlled the 2nd floor, both covered in some red aura.</p><br/><p>That he would become like them the second he was caught.</p><br/><p>And even worse.</p><br/><p>The eyes of the man at the very back.</p><br/><p>The eyes of the man who was surrounded by a strange red energy, and had a hammer in his hand.</p><br/><p>Those eyes that looked down on him.</p><br/><p>Those eyes terrified him.</p><br/><p>He could guess what his life would be like once he was completely under that man\u2019s control.</p><br/><p>But he also realized that the man\u2019s eyes became slightly softer when he looked at Karhal in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Take him hostage!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014boom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Kang Han realized that Karhal was the only hope he had, so he started to frenziedly push Karhal back.</p><br/><p>\u2014crunch!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Karhal clenched his teeth when he saw Kang Han giving up his own left arm to strike at his heart.</p><br/><p>And Kiriel shouted towards Karhal from the back.</p><br/><p>\u201cShall I help?\u201d</p><br/><p>But Karhal smashed Kang Han away as he shouted in reply.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t interrupt! I\u2019ll handle it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2018You bastard, I won\u2019t lose to you a second time!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Karhal thought back to when he\u2019d come up to the 3rd floor in the past.</p><br/><p>Though one couldn\u2019t go to and from between zones.</p><br/><p>If they had enough crystals, they could still move around the floors within the same zone.</p><br/><p>Karhal and Ekidu had come up in the past to search for traces of Hansoo back then.</p><br/><p>But it had been too late.</p><br/><p>While they were searching for Hansoo, the people above had already become transcendents, and were stronger than them.</p><br/><p>Though they were all 1 star transcendents, they had still lost.</p><br/><p>If they hadn\u2019t had any spare crystals back then they might\u2019ve died on the spot.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bastards!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Kang Han gave up his left arm, while Karhal received the attack with his left shoulder.</p><br/><p>Kiriel frowned at the crazed battle that was occuring.</p><br/><p>They were basically killing themselves.</p><br/><p>If she or Hansoo stepped in, they wouldn\u2019t even need to waste their time like this.</p><br/><p>It would just end in a single strike.</p><br/><p>\u2026tsss\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018Thankfully, there\u2019s only that one guy on the 3rd floor.\u2019</p><br/><p>Kiriel looked at the traces around the elevator and then asked Hansoo:</p><br/><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you step in?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave him be, this zone needs a King, anyway.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo silently watched Karhal, who was bleeding all over from his body, but still managed to push back the enemy.</p><br/><p>He knew the decision Karhal had made.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019ve chosen to remain here.\u2019</p><br/><p>Karhal was now fighting to gain that approval.</p><br/><p>Power that was gained through another\u2019s hand would only become a source of ridicule.</p><br/><p>Only those who fought and won the throne with their own power were fit to be kings.</p><br/><p>So Hansoo didn\u2019t help.</p><br/><p>\u2018It doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019ll need my help, anyway.\u2019</p><br/><p>He\u2019d been worried at first.</p><br/><p>Worried that he might not be able to accomplish everything he needed to do because he had to help his old comrades.</p><br/><p>So he had reminded himself.</p><br/><p>To not underestimate his comrades.</p><br/><p>\u201cDie, you bastard!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014boooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u201cAhhh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Good.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo smiled as he watched Karhal smash Kang Han onto the ground, his body still bleeding all over.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u2014smack! smack!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u201cBastards! Line up properly!\u201d</p><br/><p>Karhal shouted as he smacked the heads of the guys from the 4th zone, all of whom he\u2019d defeated after going through continued cycles of healing and fighting.</p><br/><p>From the 2nd floor to the 7th.</p><br/><p>There were a total of nine transcendents.</p><br/><p>And Ekidu was a bit shocked at this number.</p><br/><p>\u201c...Much lower than I expected.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even if it was the same 4th zone, everything became more efficient as one went up.</p><br/><p>Whether it was fighting or creating a nursery.</p><br/><p>Since the amount of crystals that came out were different.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019d normally want to climb up to the next zone once you become a 2 star.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm? Isn\u2019t it better to remain here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ekidu asked in shock.</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t it better to be a king within the 4th zone, rather than continuing to participate in the bloody massacre in the upper zones?</p><br/><p>It was why some transcendents set up the nursery.</p><br/><p>A safe pick in comparison to risking their lives above.</p><br/><p>It would be more fitting if such guys wanted to remain below.</p><br/><p>But Kiriel realized what Hansoo was saying.</p><br/><p>Since she was at a 2nd star already.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment she rose up to the 2nd star, her entire body started to throb and she was filled with anxiety.</p><br/><p>As if her body was telling her that she didn\u2019t belong here.</p><br/><p>It was such an intense feeling that if it weren\u2019t for Hansoo, she would\u2019ve long headed up already.</p><br/><p>It was too uncomfortable to just ignore.</p><br/><p>So much to the point that she felt like she wouldn\u2019t be happy, no matter what happened.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026So it wasn\u2019t just me.\u2019</p><br/><p>Other than Hansoo and the Ark-Roa, the only other 2 star she knew was that man called Kael. And she\u2019d never even talked to him properly, so she\u2019d known nothing about this.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo thought of the fairy as he looked at Kiriel\u2019s expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt just means we should be where we belong.\u201d</p><br/><p>So he would climb.</p><br/><p>Hansoo spoke to Karhal.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will stay. I\u2019m sick of it. I\u2019m sick of being beaten down over and over again. Somebody has to stay behind, anyway.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ekidu and Hansoo both nodded.</p><br/><p>Someone had to remain in the 4th zone to control those who came up.</p><br/><p>Like how they\u2019d done in the 1st ,2nd, and 3rd zones.</p><br/><p>And Karhal wanted to remain.</p><br/><p>\u2018...I really wanted to follow you.\u2019</p><br/><p>Karhal mumbled to himself as he looked at Hansoo.</p><br/><p>Why wouldn\u2019t he want to?</p><br/><p>He wanted to become strong.</p><br/><p>He wanted to stand by Hansoo.</p><br/><p>That was why he\u2019d searched for him.</p><br/><p>But during his search for Hansoo, he saw countless other adventurers being tortured by the transcendents.</p><br/><p>And realized.</p><br/><p>That somebody had to take care of them.</p><br/><p>\u2018This really doesn\u2019t suit me. Damn. Have I hung out with Ekidu for too long?\u2019</p><br/><p>At first, he had decided to remain because Ekidu had asked him for help.</p><br/><p>But now, it was his choice and his choice alone.</p><br/><p>Karhal spoke to Hansoo after finishing his thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry and put it in. I shall be responsible for your power and wreck havoc in this place, hehe. Once you leave, then I\u2019ll be the king of this place.\u201d</p><br/><p>If he borrowed the strength of Hansoo\u2019s soul fragment, then he\u2019d even be able to use the Pandemic Blade to a degree.</p><br/><p>Alongside the control of the other transcendents who were filled to the brim with the Pandemic Blade\u2019s spores.</p><br/><p>\u2018You are now my slaves, forever.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo smiled with a content expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine. You are now\u2026 the king of this world.\u201d</p><br/><p>The king with the right to control every transcendent in the 4th zone.</p><br/><p>\u2014kiiiiing\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo pulled out a soul fragment and placed his hand on Karhal\u2019s chest.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

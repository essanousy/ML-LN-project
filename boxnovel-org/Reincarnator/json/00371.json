I didn\u2019t expect that thing to keep something like this hidden beneath the Aokan.\u201d</p><br/><p>She hadn\u2019t even dreamt of something like this when she was saving the people.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn\u2026 I didn\u2019t even know what the enemy had up their sleeves. Why did I even try to defeat them?\u2019</p><br/><p>Thinking back to it, she was embarrassed beyond reason.</p><br/><p>They had taken her hostage, used her, made her attack Hansoo, and some mysterious armor had almost killed her.</p><br/><p>\u2018Wait\u2026 This does feel familiar.\u2019</p><br/><p>But according to her own memories, she had never been here.</p><br/><p>As Enbi Arin looked around curiously, Kiriel also roamed around and inspected the surrounding area.</p><br/><p>There were three distinct things about this place.</p><br/><p>The giant crystal that was supplying a tremendous amount of energy upwards.</p><br/><p>The devoured corpses of a strange race that were barely maintaining their shape.</p><br/><p>And the dried-up blue armor that race had apparently worn.</p><br/><p>As Kiriel looked at the dried-up armor, she also came to the same question Hansoo had before.</p><br/><p>\u2018What the\u2026 Then where did Hansoo\u2019s armor come from?\u2019</p><br/><p>It looked like Melchizedek had been the one to find it.</p><br/><p>And it had planned to use the corpses and the energy here to raise the Quirae and send them away.</p><br/><p>It should have acquired the blue armor here as well.</p><br/><p>But if every other armor had dried up, why was Hansoo\u2019s still functioning?</p><br/><p>\u2018Do the dried-up ones still function?\u2019</p><br/><p>Kiriel, who had the Dragon God Armor, reached out with her hands towards the blue armor in anticipation.</p><br/><p>Although the Dragon God Armor she had on was strong, it was still a bit weaker in comparison to the blue armor Hansoo wore.</p><br/><p>Although Enbi Arin could not control the blue armor and had almost died from it, that was a story of the past.</p><br/><p>They, who had risen up to the level of a 3-Star, could easily support the blue armor with their mana.</p><br/><p>But Kiriel was left disappointed after touching the blue armor.</p><br/><p>\u2026sssssss...</p><br/><p>The blue armor disintegrated to dust the moment she touched it.</p><br/><p>She had wondered, but indeed, these were all useless.</p><br/><p>Completely dried up.</p><br/><p>She grew even more curious about Hansoo\u2019s armor and started to use her Psychometry.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s see\u2026 Something should come up if I search this room.\u2019</p><br/><p>And soon\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014ooooooong\u2014 </p><br/><p>Her upgraded Psychometry started to sweep through the room.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>As Kiriel and Enbi Arin searched the area below\u2014 </p><br/><p>Kyaaaak!</p><br/><p>\u2014a battle was raging on above.</p><br/><p>Well, it was more like a massacre than a battle.</p><br/><p>Kyaaak!</p><br/><p>Countless Quirae were melting down from the red clouds.</p><br/><p>Hansoo smiled bitterly as he looked below at the hard exoskeletons and the human appearances all melting down into nothingness.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am sorry that I couldn\u2019t rescue you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKrrrrk\u2026 ugh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo mumbled as he looked at the women who were giving birth to more Quirae.</p><br/><p>There was nothing he could do after the Quirae had infected them.</p><br/><p>Nothing except to send them off peacefully.</p><br/><p>So he had to clean this place up thoroughly.</p><br/><p>If he didn\u2019t, then the others coming up after them might end up as sacrifices as well.</p><br/><p>The Quirae\u2019s reproduction speed was infamous, even within the Abyss.</p><br/><p>Like the Ark-Roa, they were a top priority target for any force once found.</p><br/><p>The third floor of the Abyss, which had ignored this, had become the Quirae\u2019s lair.</p><br/><p>\u2018It was insane.\u2019</p><br/><p>Evolving through humans was just the beginning.</p><br/><p>The stronger the thing eaten, the longer its digestion, and it would go through more levels of evolution.</p><br/><p>Humans bred 3rd-level Quirae, and the strange race here bred 5th-level Quirae.</p><br/><p>Hansoo thought back to scenes created by the ones who had evolved past 20 levels and focused back on cleaning again.</p><br/><p>He wanted to make this place, the Aokan, clean at least.</p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The red clouds that had been drifting around him started vigorously acting up and expanded at a crazy rate.</p><br/><p>Kyaaak!</p><br/><p>Aaaahh!</p><br/><p>Hansoo went around Aokan while listening to the screams and soon reached the area where Kiriel had fought before.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tsk. They all died.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo shook his head as he looked at traces of the nine\u2014not even their corpses had remained.</p><br/><p>Since Kiriel wouldn\u2019t attack them first, there was only one reason this had happened.</p><br/><p>\u2018There are always those who look to attack from the back.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014clank\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014clank\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo looked around at the nine sets of Dragon God Armor on the ground and then picked up three.</p><br/><p>The others had been damaged too much to be of use, but these three still looked functional.</p><br/><p>If he gave one to Enbi Arin, then she would use it well.</p><br/><p>Hansoo stood up after taking the three sets of armor and then looked at the control center at the back.</p><br/><p>\u2018Not bad. She does have some ability.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo thought as he looked at the control center cut cleanly in two.</p><br/><p>Even if the Kiriel\u2019s fang was a gift from the fairy.</p><br/><p>Even if she had become a 3-Star.</p><br/><p>Cutting something like that in two in such a clean manner was not easy.</p><br/><p>But she had done it.</p><br/><p>As soon as she climbed to the level of a 3-Star.</p><br/><p>Hansoo whistled at the sight but then frowned.</p><br/><p>\u2018...?\u2019</p><br/><p>The nine Dragon God Soldiers were dead.</p><br/><p>But there were traces of teleportation.</p><br/><p>Traces of minimal troubleshooting on the control tower, enough to reactivate it.</p><br/><p>Hansoo frowned and thought back to Kriel\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u2018N-Aroel\u2026 Was that his name?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014sssss!\u2014 </p><br/><p>As Hansoo melted away the rest of the control center\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u201cHansoo!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014Enbi Arin and Kiriel shouted from a distance as they quickly dashed towards him.</p><br/><p>Hansoo chuckled as he looked at the two arriving before him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou finished it quickly. Here\u2019s a present, Arin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014clank\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo handed Enbi Arin the Dragon God Armor still in the best condition of the three.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you. I\u2019ll use it well.\u201d</p><br/><p>There would be countless battles ahead of them.</p><br/><p>The better their equipment, the better their situation would be.</p><br/><p>\u2014clakakakak!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The moment Enbi Arin touched the Dragon God Armor, the armor quickly detached into countless pieces and surrounded her body.</p><br/><p>Hansoo listened to the sounds of friction between the metal pieces and spoke to Kiriel.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder if you had fun looking at the museum. Did you enjoy watching the mummies and the ancient artifacts?\u201d</p><br/><p>The corpses and armor that looked at least hundreds of years old.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a stretch to call it a museum at that point.</p><br/><p>Kiriel shrugged her shoulders and replied:</p><br/><p>\u201cSure, I didn\u2019t even need an audio guide.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo chuckled.</p><br/><p>\u2018If I had an ability like that, I would have loved going to places like the museum.\u2019</p><br/><p>An ability to read the past would be fun to use in a place like a museum.</p><br/><p>Hansoo cleaned up his useless thoughts and asked:</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, did you find out what happened to the armor?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiriel\u2019s expression turned serious and replied:</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>As to how only one armor could stay preserved.</p><br/><p>She figured some things out as she read the past.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026 something wore it until recently.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was worn?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiriel nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo realized what had happened from this short conversation.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo\u2026 There are still surviving owners of this blue armor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiriel nodded with a dark expression.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u2014kuuuuuooooo\u2014 </p><br/><p>N-Akuon wore an excited expression as he listened to N-Aroel\u2019s second story.</p><br/><p>\u201c...So, other than those aliens and that new race, there\u2019s another race still alive?\u201d</p><br/><p>N-Aroel nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I like that you\u2019re quick to understand. After going into that hole, everything else was a corpse, but one was still alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026 how? You said it was wearing that strange armor?\u201d</p><br/><p>N-Akuon made a confused expression.</p><br/><p>He knew how the armor could\u2019ve stayed functional and not dried up.</p><br/><p>If it were equipped onto somebody still alive, it could absorb the energy from the host and maintain itself.</p><br/><p>But according to what he\u2019d heard, that armor was evil beyond reason.</p><br/><p>The host should\u2019ve long been dead from having that much energy absorbed.</p><br/><p>But N-Aroel chuckled.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I mention that crystal before?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>N-Akuon nodded.</p><br/><p>The crystal that supplied a tremendous amount of energy.</p><br/><p>If one supplied themselves with energy from that crystal, it could explain how the owner of that blue armor had survived.</p><br/><p>Since that ridiculous amount of energy could easily supply the blue armor.</p><br/><p>N-Aroel continued to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe\u2026 the host had been able to survive thanks to the armor. A symbiotic relationship of a sort?\u201d</p><br/><p>The blue armor sucked energy from its owner and in return used its life support functions to keep the host alive.</p><br/><p>The host supplied the armor with energy and barely managed to survive.</p><br/><p>And as he heard up to this point\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014a question appeared inside N-Akuon\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026 where did the host go? The owner of the blue armor.\u201d</p><br/><p>N-Aroel laughed as he said:</p><br/><p>\u201cI love how well you understand these things. Right. That\u2019s the third story I\u2019m about to tell you.\u201d</p><br/><p>N-Aroel pointed towards the head of the Nelkipa, the final destination of the aliens, and spoke.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

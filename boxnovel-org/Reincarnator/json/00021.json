class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>Hansoo, who was smoking on the cloud snack, opened his mouth while he looked at Sangjin.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you seek for?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo could vaguely guess.</p><br/><p>That this guy had killed those guys for him instead.</p><br/><p>If he had the thoughts of getting rid of him then he could\u2019ve just pushed them in while he was busy fighting the beast.</p><br/><p>But Sangjin had helped in a way that he could survive.</p><br/><p>By warning him with a shout from above and acting after the beast\u2019s movements had slowed down.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hoo\u2019</p><br/><p>Sangjin breathed in and out as he looked at Hansoo.</p><br/><p>He had been thinking Hansoo only until now.</p><br/><p>\u2018I want to follow Hansoo\u2019</p><br/><p>This was clear.</p><br/><p>This had sprung up from three things: Longing, envy and a pursuit for safety.</p><br/><p>But he didn\u2019t know what exactly would happen from now.</p><br/><p>But he thought he couldn\u2019t be with Hansoo because he was weak and because of this he thought that he just needed to become stronger.</p><br/><p>But whilst he was pondering over this, Suyeol had approached him.</p><br/><p>When Sangjin saw Suyeol and his friends approach him he thought of something.</p><br/><p>That this was a trap in order to bring harm to Hansoo.</p><br/><p>But he followed just to see hear their story.</p><br/><p>If they crossed the line he was going to beat them down.</p><br/><p>It was clear that he was the strongest after Hansoo and he had created a large gap between him and the others.</p><br/><p>And so he had thought that he could become like Hansoo.</p><br/><p>Maybe not as much as Hansoo but he thought that he could at least beat around 10 people.</p><br/><p>But this was a very big misunderstanding.</p><br/><p>There only a single number between him and Hansoo in ranking but there was a gap between them that could not be caught up and smashing down a large group was something only Hansoo could do.</p><br/><p>He understood the moment he got surrounded by the ten people.</p><br/><p>That he could not beat them.</p><br/><p>But he could not deject them here.</p><br/><p>Then they will definitely kill him in a manner so that Hansoo wouldn\u2019t notice.</p><br/><p>From the way they were talking it seemed like that they were going to go hit Hansoo from the back no matter what happened.</p><br/><p>Kill him or take him alive then kill Hansoo with him there.</p><br/><p>There were only two options.</p><br/><p>So he followed.</p><br/><p>Since he couldn\u2019t die on that spot.</p><br/><p>They had told him to try going to his friends but if he had turned around in that situation then he probably would\u2019ve been stabbed from behind at that spot.</p><br/><p>Sangjin thought of countless things whilst he walked.</p><br/><p>How he would get out of this situation.</p><br/><p>The anxiousness of possibly dying had calmed down as he walked with the ten.</p><br/><p>The thought of him having become a lot stronger had been replaced with the thoughts of his lack of strength.</p><br/><p>These guys were scared of Hansoo so they couldn\u2019t act out in the front and had stayed behind him.</p><br/><p>While they were throwing empty threats at them straightforwardly.</p><br/><p>He had to look good in Hansoo\u2019s eyes but if he couldn\u2019t even take care of these ten guys what could he do.</p><br/><p>His head started spinning at a crazy rate while in was in danger.</p><br/><p>And at the same time he, who had seemed very big, started to look smaller and something became clear to him.</p><br/><p>Very very clear.</p><br/><p>\u2018There is no way that I can be with Hansoo by becoming strong independently.\u2019</p><br/><p>The thought of being approved after becoming strong and then following him was arrogant in itself.</p><br/><p>And the thought of being approved after leading a large group was the same.</p><br/><p>He realized after calming down and judging himself objectively.</p><br/><p>That no matter how hard he struggled alone or even with a bunch of scrubs, the gap between Hansoo would only become wider.</p><br/><p>No, it was likely that he will become even weaker by being near weaker people.</p><br/><p>And at the same time longing, envy and admiration had disappeared and a different mindset had risen up.</p><br/><p>That jealousy or longing was something that he should have only when he had the leisure to.</p><br/><p>The current him was in no state to do so.</p><br/><p>If he acted arrogantly just because he got a little bit stronger and get attacked by a mob then he would just get killed.</p><br/><p>He had to set somebody faster than him in front of him as the goal and chase them zealously.</p><br/><p>When his thoughts had cleared up, one thing became clear.</p><br/><p>That he wasn\u2019t in the situation to question a lot of things.</p><br/><p>He just had to catch up while he was still within his eyesight.</p><br/><p>He will approve of me if I become strong\u2026 he had been looking at this situation in a very laid back manner.</p><br/><p>\u2018But how?\u2019</p><br/><p>He had already lost his chance.</p><br/><p>He had to prove his worthiness in order to catch up to him.</p><br/><p>And at that moment he saw Suyeol and the others who were walking next to him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Aha. This is it.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s existence was fear in itself but at the same time he was a very temping existence which dropped numerous artifacts and ruins along with his death.</p><br/><p>Like a tiger which was scary to no extent but drops a very tempting skin upon death.</p><br/><p>People who would want to send Hansoo into traps like these would probably keep coming up.</p><br/><p>If they don\u2019t die then they will bother him without giving up.</p><br/><p>So he realized.</p><br/><p>How he could get approved by Hansoo.</p><br/><p>How he could help Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cHansoo. Use me\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo showed a conspicuous color as he gazed at Sangjin.</p><br/><p>And then Sangjin bit down on his teeth inwardly.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ve had the wrong thoughts until now\u2019</p><br/><p>Since he had Hansoo were running towards the same goal, he thought that they could become acquaintances.</p><br/><p>Because he was misled by useless thoughts and emotions he didn\u2019t realize the main point and thought that he just needed to become strong.</p><br/><p>But he was wrong.</p><br/><p>He and Hansoo had different goals from the start.</p><br/><p>While he was looking out to survive day by day, Hansoo was running while looking at something in.</p><br/><p>the distance without stopping.</p><br/><p>While they were struggling in order to survive and become stronger, he was acting with his personal rules.</p><br/><p>From dividing runes perfectly from the start to every little detail.</p><br/><p>He had to keep moving but he didn\u2019t hurry and always followed the things he had to.</p><br/><p>The moment he realized this was when he didn\u2019t kill Taesoon and his friends and just left them alive.</p><br/><p>There was no such thing as being disabled here.</p><br/><p>If you don\u2019t cut off their lifeline then they could come back even higher health but even so he had left them alive and created future troubles.</p><br/><p>Even though it would\u2019ve been more convenient to take their runes after killing them.</p><br/><p>And it was like that on the altar too.</p><br/><p>Though it would\u2019ve been a piece of cake for Hansoo to just take the runes from them, he had given them the options.</p><br/><p>Sangjin, who had pondered his actions for a while, realized it finally.</p><br/><p>That Hansoo was ignoring the acts which would bring him instantaneous rewards because he was looking at something in the distance.</p><br/><p>Though it would be of benefit to becoming stronger in the moment, he knew that it would bring harm to what he wanted to accomplish.</p><br/><p>Sangjin didn\u2019t know if this was because of his psychic powers or because he was smart.</p><br/><p>But once he figured this out, one thing became clear.</p><br/><p>The way he could become useful to Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you don\u2019t kill people. But as I see it, it isn\u2019t that you don\u2019t kill them because you don\u2019t want to kill them right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even monkeys would realize it.</p><br/><p>If he could do that much then killing was a piece of cake.</p><br/><p>Which meant there was another reason why Hansoo didn\u2019t kill.</p><br/><p>And by leaving them behind, it seemed like that he just needed to not dirty his hands.</p><br/><p>Sangjin spoke as he looked at Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cUse me. I will dirty my hands instead of you. But then take me with you. No, allow me to follow you\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo always acted with a clear goal.</p><br/><p>But because he looked at things on the long term, it was likely that he needed to endure things that grabbed onto his ankles momentarily.</p><br/><p>And in that moment, he could do things instead of Hansoo.</p><br/><p>Like a cleans who cleans after Hansoo so he could focus on his own goals.</p><br/><p>Since he had already threw away his first chances, this was the only chance for him to be accepted by him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI could only use a method that put you in danger as well because I was weak but I can make sure that there won\u2019t be a time where I even get close to your line\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo was special.</p><br/><p>There will definitely be guys who will be jealous of and envy Hansoo and block his path.</p><br/><p>And out of those people, there will be guys which Hansoo would leave alone because of this personal rules and his goals.</p><br/><p>He was willing to thoroughly erase those guys.</p><br/><p>So Hansoo can focus on his own goals.</p><br/><p>And for that he will become strong by following Hansoo around.</p><br/><p>Since he, who had followed him for a few days, had become the strongest after Hansoo.</p><br/><p>By helping Hansoo to run faster, he, who is also following Hansoo, would also become faster.</p><br/><p>And if he had another small wish he wanted to find out what Hansoo\u2019s goals were.</p><br/><p>But this would be completed naturally if he stuck by Hansoo and helped him.</p><br/><p>Hansoo, who had been listening to his story, chuckled.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if I say yes, what would you if it\u2019s a situation where you cannot follow? For example getting pushed off forcefully\u201d</p><br/><p>Then Sangjin\u2019s expression froze.</p><br/><p>He thought that he was being abandoned.</p><br/><p>But his thoughts changed after seeing Hansoo who was smiling in amusement.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026there must be something in the 2nd tutorial\u2019</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know what but he head seen it with his psychic powers.</p><br/><p>That they would forcibly be separated in the 2nd tutorial area.</p><br/><p>Sangjin clenched his teeth.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026 I will become stronger and come find you. Let\u2019s at least go back to our old relationship.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo laughed as he responded.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo down\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Dammit, is it not possible?\u2019</p><br/><p>Sangjin bit his teeth for a moment and then shouted loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cKang Hansoo! Can\u2019t a person can make a mistake once in awhile! I had to make a choose something I didn\u2019t have a choice against because I was weak but I\u2019m just starting! Fuck just try using me! And if I\u2019m still useless then you can leave me behind!\u201d</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t worthy enough.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t enough until now and he wasn\u2019t still enough.</p><br/><p>But he gained another chance he had the confidence to do better.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fuck. Just once! Please!\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo threw down the cloud snack which he had finished smoking and then spoke whilst looking at Sangjin.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t misunderstand things. Come here tomorrow around one. I would have killed that thing below by then\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd then take all the runes that are below. You killed those 10 so you should take them. Well. Let\u2019s see each other later with smiles on our faces\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangjin\u2019s expression became bright at those words.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo mumbled inwardly as he looked at that Sangjin.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hmm.. though it\u2019s a little awkward\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo thought of what he and Eres talked about in the past.</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded at those words.</p><br/><p>Since that was always Eres\u2019 problem.</p><br/><p>And because of Eres, there existed cleaners.</p><br/><p>No, it was a necessity that every sovereign had even if they weren\u2019t Eres.</p><br/><p>People who would dirty their hands instead of the sovereign.</p><br/><p>And people who would help their owner head towards their goal.</p><br/><p>And Eres looked at Hansoo as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u2018I was actually going to Enbi Arin but\u2026 I will see first\u2019</p><br/><p>He would need to use the cloud snack again in order to kill the Carnivorous beast.</p><br/><p>But it didn\u2019t seem like much of a loss.</p><br/><p>Since it seems that a lot of things changed in a small moment.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s very cheap if it\u2019s just some runes and cloud snacks\u2019</p><br/><p>The cloud snack was just something that worked on the normal runes anyway.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t work on the colorless runes so he couldn\u2019t use it for that long.</p><br/><p>Of course he didn\u2019t know how far he could trust Sangjin.</p><br/><p>When the second tutorial begins than everyone here would be forcibly separated around the second tutorial area and they would not know when they would meet again.</p><br/><p>His mind might have changed by the time they meet again.</p><br/><p>But investments were always something like this.</p><br/><p>An investment of a few runes and eight cloud snacks in order to attain a chance of getting a decent Punisher was a very good investment.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well. If it fails then there\u2019s nothing I can do about that\u2019</p><br/><p>If that happened he could just follow his original plans.</p><br/><p>Hansoo, after looking at Sangjin who was going down, started to regenerate his health.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Kudududk</p><br/><p>Hansoo cut off the Carnivorous beast\u2019s life as he ruthlessly stabbed the needle into its heart.</p><br/><p>Kuuuhhhh\u2026</p><br/><p>It let out a last cry as it fell down.</p><br/><p>He had went hunting and had already experience him so he only needed to smoke six of them to kill it.</p><br/><p>The carnivorous beast didn\u2019t drop any runes as if it wasn\u2019t designed to be killed.</p><br/><p>The floor was littered with the runes of the guys who had died yesterday but Hansoo didn\u2019t even take a glance at them as he started to walk towards a corner of the Altar.</p><br/><p>The requirements of the Hidden piece was simple in some ways.</p><br/><p>To kill the monster before it destroyed the Altar and jumped out.</p><br/><p>For it to come out it needed to destroy the Altar but in that instant the chance of attaining the hidden piece disappears.</p><br/><p>Which meant that if you wanted to kill him you needed to kill it inside the Altar where his fears got amplified.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s seriously not something that was designed for somebody to kill\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo went into the room in the corner of the Altar that Kwang Goonju had told him jokingly in the past.</p><br/><p>And in the middle of the room there was a single artifact.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s not a skill but\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t that disappointed, if he were to compare an artifact and a skill of the same quality then the artifact was more useful despite his trait.</p><br/><p>If it was useful to a point.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s see what they give\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo had a bit of anticipation as he walked to the middle of the pedestal.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo\u2019s face, which did not get shocked easily, started to tremble at a minute level.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Ring of the Vampire King Nurmaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Solo ranking </p><br/><p>The strongest artifact which represented Kwang Goonju.</p><br/><p>\u2018Kwang Goonju this guy. I wondered where he had obtained this\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo sighed as he saw this.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

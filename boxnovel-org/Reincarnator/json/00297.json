So the Abyss will fall upon us before you guys can get stronger.

Of course even if I tell you this it won\u2019t be easy. But you need to use this information as the basis to continually get stronger.

Good, good.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fairy felt the vibrations in the air as it smiled.</p><br/><p>Though normal humans couldn\u2019t sense this, it could as it was an overseer.</p><br/><p>The scene of the information regarding the Abyss spreading out to hundreds of millions of people in an instant.</p><br/><p>And as the information densities between the Abyss and this location were equalizing, the giant wall that stood between the two worlds started to break down.</p><br/><p>The wall that the god had erected and that they were watching over.</p><br/><p>Rummblee.</p><br/><p>The fairy smiled as it spoke to Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cWill you be okay though? They will hate you a lot.\u201d</p><br/><p>People will find a target to direct their anger and fear when they found out about bad news.</p><br/><p>And even more so if they couldn\u2019t do anything about those news.</p><br/><p>Moreover the person who gave those news was extremely calm, as if the approaching calamity wouldn\u2019t affect him at all.</p><br/><p>If Hansoo continued to spread information out like this and these were all true, it\u2019s clear who the people will think of when they start suffering.</p><br/><p>The fairy chuckled.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe prophet will always be treated badly right? Why don\u2019t you try making excuses? You can lie to them or something.\u201d</p><br/><p>The prophets who gave bad prophecies never had a good ending.</p><br/><p>Look at the past chinese dynasties.</p><br/><p>History clearly showed what happened to those who spoke ill of the future.</p><br/><p>There were only two cases in which the prophet received a good treatment.</p><br/><p>Either they would say things that people liked.</p><br/><p>Or they would lead people towards the correct path and navigate them through a bad future.</p><br/><p>Of course Mudusella belonged to the latter, this was how she was able to receive the respect of her whole race.</p><br/><p>Hansoo cut off the fairy.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no time to explain.\u201d</p><br/><p>Each time more information was released hastened the descent of the Abyss.</p><br/><p>And he couldn\u2019t release all the information at once either.</p><br/><p>He needed to stay on the edge.</p><br/><p>So people would be able to survive.</p><br/><p>And because of this, there was a limit to how much information he could tell them.</p><br/><p>He needed to tell them the most important information first.</p><br/><p>Since there was a limit to how much he could tell them, every word he said was precious.</p><br/><p>Hansoo finished his words and spoke towards the screen again.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe most dangerous beings that will appear in the Green Zone are the Dakramas. These guys usually use supersonic waves to communicate and\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone thought that Hansoo was telling the same thing in all the zones but that was not correct.</p><br/><p>While Hansoo was telling the people of the Green Zone the relevant information, he was using the soul fragments to tell different things to the people in the different zones.</p><br/><p>Just the necessary information for each floor.</p><br/><p>Soon the Great Collapse will happen and the information he was telling them was the most crucial for them to survive.</p><br/><p>Knowing or not knowing made a huge difference, especially if one\u2019s life was on the line.</p><br/><p>And every floor had different things they needed to know.</p><br/><p>The things he were telling them would be of great help when the change came.</p><br/><p>\u2018Though it\u2019s far from everything\u2026 It should be much better since they have information and strength unlike in the past.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo mumbled as he absorbed the information the owners of the soul fragments had about the different zones.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo\u2019s efforts weren\u2019t in vain.</p><br/><p>The strength of the humans were countless levels higher than when the Abyss fell upon them in the past.</p><br/><p>First, there were many more people and each individual\u2019s strength was much higher than that of the past.</p><br/><p>Internal strife had been reduced as much as possible and though there wasn\u2019t a lot of camaraderie, some friendship still existed between adventurers.</p><br/><p>Even if the Abyss opened, they would fare much better than in the past.</p><br/><p>\u2018Survive well\u2026 And become strong.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cThe greatest weakness of the Dakramas is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As Hansoo started to talk to the people of the Green Zone.</p><br/><p>A tremendous tremor could be felt through his skin.</p><br/><p>Although logically nobody should be able to sense this, he, who had the right to break through the roof, could feel it.</p><br/><p>This familiar sensation.</p><br/><p>The ceiling was collapsing.</p><br/><p>The tremor that broke the wall between the two dimensions.</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahahaha! Good job mister Hansoo!\u201d</p><br/><p>The fairy laughed out loud as it snapped its fingers.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Rummble.</p><br/><p>A tremendous tremor that everybody could feel rang throughout the entire world.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Rumble.</p><br/><p>\u201c...What the?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone started to freak out.</p><br/><p>A great change was occurring.</p><br/><p>The sky was breaking apart.</p><br/><p>The clouds split apart as a crack appeared.</p><br/><p>The grounds broke apart.</p><br/><p>Mountain ranges broke down as fissures appeared.</p><br/><p>Craaaaaack.</p><br/><p>Holes appeared in the skies and on earth and continued to enlarge.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Uddduuudk.</p><br/><p>The holes stopped growing as they stabilized.</p><br/><p>But the tremor continued to become stronger and stronger.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck, it was all real huh\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Karhal cursed out.</p><br/><p>He wished that this was all a lie.</p><br/><p>He really hoped that this was all an elaborate joke.</p><br/><p>Even if they were scared to their wits, he hoped it ended there.</p><br/><p>But sadly that wasn\u2019t the case.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Fuck. It would\u2019ve been better if his personality had changed to that of a liar.\u2019</p><br/><p>He wished that the new personality of Hansoo was full of lies and flat air.</p><br/><p>But unluckily, his new personality seemed to be similar to the one they knew.</p><br/><p>In that he was always serious.</p><br/><p>Rummmblee.</p><br/><p>And the tremors were continuously becoming stronger and stronger.</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>From between the cracks and fissures.</p><br/><p>Boooooooom!</p><br/><p>Huge pillars landed upon them.</p><br/><p>They descended from the endless skies.</p><br/><p>Huge metal pillars that seemed like they could penetrate right through the planet.</p><br/><p>And soon a familiar voice was heard.</p><br/><p>A vicious and maniacal laugh of an existence who brought disasters wherever it went.</p><br/><p>The voice of the fairy could be heard throughout the ears of everyone.</p><br/><p>Not just Karhal but everyone from the Red Zone and all the way to the Violet Zone.</p><br/><p>Throughout the ears of every adventurer in the Seven Colored Zones.</p><br/><p>&lt;...We will begin the gustation phase.

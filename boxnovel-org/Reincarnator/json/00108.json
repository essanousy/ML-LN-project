You can\u2019t possibly believe his words right?\u201d</p><br/><p>At those words the first pillar, one of the Garde-barongs, shook his head as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that but\u2026 Our job is to protect you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The priestess was too important for their race.</p><br/><p>The job of protecting the priestess had higher priority over everything.</p><br/><p>Oteon made a dumbfounded expression at those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>What did that matter in this current situation?</p><br/><p>The first pillar alone could crush all of those guys.</p><br/><p>Why would she get in danger?</p><br/><p>The first pillar looked at the expression on Oteon\u2019s face as he pointed towards the one whom he had smashed earlier with his eyes.</p><br/><p>And Oteon felt a chill run down her back as she looked at that direction.</p><br/><p>A man who held a spear towards their direction with extremely calm eyes.</p><br/><p>Something was clustered upon the tip of the Golden Spear that could not be identified.</p><br/><p>And the tip of the spear was pointing right at her.</p><br/><p>Only 1 thing came up in her head as she saw the spear.</p><br/><p>Margos Du Tiradus.</p><br/><p>A top tier predator which ate apart the Margoths and had a strong venom.</p><br/><p>Surprisingly, that aura and the sensation of those sharp teeth were radiating out from the tiny spear in the human\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>The first pillar shrugged his shoulder as he saw Oteon shrug her shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou see it right? Though blocking that spear isn\u2019t hard\u2026 The moment that thing at the tip of the spear explodes out, half of the people here who are weak will die along with you.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Damnit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Their saplings were too important in a situation where they had a very low amount of individuals in their population.</p><br/><p>A sweet carrot along with a deadly whip.</p><br/><p>Oteon realized that she had been caught in a trap.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt might\u2019ve been different if you had not been let in here in the first place but\u2026 Since you\u2019re here let\u2019s hear your story. Anyway you saved Ailen as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed like the first pillar quite liked this person.</p><br/><p>Oteon looked at the people in front of her with a disgusting frown on her face.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, I thank you for saving Ailen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn. Hearing a single thanks is damned hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tares complained quietly from the side.</p><br/><p>This was reasonable.</p><br/><p>How could he feel good if he had almost become a grinded up fish cake when they had brought a person which they had saved?</p><br/><p>Oteon decided to ignore Tares, who was still mumbling, after giving him a cold look and then started to focus on the man in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did you hear about the Crown of Thorns?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo laughed as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s not the important thing right now. We should solve the Gragos problem first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s something that you humans should be worried about. We just need to leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>And their preparations were actually going well.</p><br/><p>Hansoo shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u2018No way.\u2019</p><br/><p>A move would only have a high success chance when they prepared from the red warning.</p><br/><p>It wouldn\u2019t be weird for the Gragos to roll whenever when it was in the black.</p><br/><p>But for them to start the move in such a situation.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well. They probably don\u2019t have another way.\u2019</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t know the reason and since it was hard to scout outside the temple due to the humans, the solution not being simple was obvious.</p><br/><p>Hansoo straightforwardly told them his situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll speak truthfully. I have received the memory crystal of Elkadion in the Red Zone below.\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course he had obtained it in the Abyss but there was no need to reveal this.</p><br/><p>\u2018With this much\u2026 The invasion of the Abyss wouldn\u2019t get affected that much.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was good to at least tell the origin of the intel if they wanted to have a good conversation.</p><br/><p>Oteon made a helpless expression as she heard the few pieces of information which came out from Hansoo\u2019s mouth and could only verify them to be true.</p><br/><p>These things were things one couldn\u2019t know unless they were Elkadion herself.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why did the relic the first seed left behind get to him?\u2019</p><br/><p>Oteon looked at Hansoo with an expression of resentment but then spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you hand over that memory crystal then I\u2019ll think about our alliance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry to tell you but I memorized it all you see.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Oteon sighed.</p><br/><p>Though she had expected it, not even a single gesture went through.</p><br/><p>Hansoo then looked at that Oteon as he continued to explain this plan.</p><br/><p>The cure for the other Gragos.</p><br/><p>And even the plan after that.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026O Elkadion.\u2019</p><br/><p>Oteon made a regrettable expression after saluting to Elkadion\u2019s compassion which had found help for her race despite her death as she spoke towards Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we do things according to what you say then there\u2019s nothing bad for us, it\u2019s actually rather good. But there is a problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCredibility.\u201d</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t know how much was the truth and how much were lies.</p><br/><p>The thing he had brought was sweet beyond reason.</p><br/><p>Which means they had to be even more careful.</p><br/><p>Since if that sweet thing was a fatal poison and they swallowed it, they will have to suffer the</p><br/><p>consequences.</p><br/><p>Hansoo shrugged his shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>Oteon spoke as if she was waiting for this moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis problem was probably caused by the humans again. Since it\u2019s only normal for there to be some room according to calculations. So solve this problem and fix the black warning. Then we will help you. We won\u2019t butt in on this current incident.\u201d</p><br/><p>The problems created by humans had to be ended by the humans.</p><br/><p>Only then would they get the basic rights to an alliance.</p><br/><p>The Akaron had no thoughts of joining and bleeding because of the problem the humans had created.</p><br/><p>\u2018And\u2026 Watch over this guy during that time.\u2019</p><br/><p>Words were light and the only thing that can actually determine a human being are their actions.</p><br/><p>An idea would be grasped as they see how he deals with this.</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded.</p><br/><p>\u2018I should at least do this much.\u2019</p><br/><p>Actually it will be quite a bit troublesome for him as well if the Gragos decided to roll.</p><br/><p>Since he needed to get to the White Tiger Gragos, , and meet the great patriarch.</p><br/><p>Hansoo thought of a moment about Sangjin and then spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s receive something ahead before we start.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oteon pondered for a moment while looking at Hansoo and then nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. You and two people will receive the body enhancement surgery. The girl behind you. Mr. Tekilon. You should receive it as well. Though it would only take a bit if you were a part of our race\u2026 Since your bodies are of a different race it will take about 2 days. You cannot come out during the surgery.\u201d</p><br/><p>The 3 males and 3 females, including Tares, frowned at those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tekilon spoke instead of Ailen.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not something anyone can receive. This is only possible if you have a physical basis that can support it. If you undergo it with the current level of your physique then your bodies will blow up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The expressions of Tares and the others instantly got filled with dejection.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t seem like a lie from the sorry expression of Ailen.</p><br/><p>Since there was no need to lie just to fool a few of them.</p><br/><p>They just needed to say they didn\u2019t want to if they didn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>Since they couldn\u2019t do anything to them anyways.</p><br/><p>Tares made a dejected expression as he dragged himself towards the place they would stay at following Ailen\u2019s guidance.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>The 3 males and 3 females looked at each other in the cave and whispered quietly at each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamnit. Is it the end like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Takuya, one of the 2 males other than Tares mumbled with a depressed expression.</p><br/><p>For them to only receive a good sight after coming in here through hardships.</p><br/><p>Of course the Temple was not something anybody could see but their expectations had become too big because of this.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026How did it turn like this?\u2019</p><br/><p>Tares sighed.</p><br/><p>Helping Ailen in the beginning was actually very innocent.</p><br/><p>He had no form of greed.</p><br/><p>But the idea of a reward started to come up the harder it got to help out Ailen.</p><br/><p>From then the reward became a focus.</p><br/><p>They hadn\u2019t stayed by Ailen to help her but more so because the amount of help they had given her was too regretful to leave behind.</p><br/><p>The reason why they had stuck around despite Ailen telling them that it\u2019ll get dangerous and that she\u2019ll go alone was because of this.</p><br/><p>While they were lost in silence, the female in the corner, Mirian, clenched onto the teeth and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo are we done like this? Without being able to get anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTares. I keep saying this. You\u2019re too soft. It\u2019s not weird for us to die at any moment if we continue like this!\u201d</p><br/><p>The fact that they were soft had gotten the six of them together.</p><br/><p>But then it won\u2019t be weird for the six of them to die at any time if they continued to give free volunteer work.</p><br/><p>Tares sighed at Mirian\u2019s words as she spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mirian pondered for a moment, cut her pants and then showed her thighs.</p><br/><p>And then she dug around her flesh for a bit and then pulled something wrapped in leather.</p><br/><p>Tares flinched after seeing this.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026 We denied that deal before.\u201d</p><br/><p>A secret deal that they had gotten ahold of while following around AIlen.</p><br/><p>Tares cut them off on the spot.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know their objectives but why would they keep it so secretive if it was something that could be told to the world.</p><br/><p>He had thought that he denied them completely but it seems Mirian met them separately.</p><br/><p>Mirian clenched her teeth and then spoke towards Tares.</p><br/><p>\u201cTares. Decide. I understand you want to be kind to everyone but we can\u2019t do that. We need to grab ahold of this deal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Why would such a big chance like this come to them who were ordinary 5th years?</p><br/><p>They will really receive a big reward if they take this deal at this moment.</p><br/><p>Enough to get ahead in this Otherworld quite a bit.</p><br/><p>\u201cChoose. Is it us? Or is it Ailen?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tares made a complicated expression at the leather pouch which had red light shining off from it.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Kiiiing</p><br/><p>A man laughed coldy as he looked at the gem that was suddenly shining red.</p><br/><p>\u201cI won right? I told you they\u2019ll contact me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The girl next to the man frowned at this.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamnit. That Tares. I thought he was a good guy but he was just this much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a limit to being good. You can\u2019t ignore the opinions of others around you. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man who had won received something from the woman in glee as he looked towards the location the gem was pointing at and slashed beneath his feet happily.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go quickly. We need to go with all our strength since they won\u2019t be pushovers.\u201d</p><br/><p>Though there was worry in the details there wasn\u2019t any uneasiness in the voice.</p><br/><p>Kuuuuuunngg!</p><br/><p>Chuguk</p><br/><p>The man who had split the giant neck of the Margoth beneath his feet in two started to send carrier pigeons towards his clan in the distance.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

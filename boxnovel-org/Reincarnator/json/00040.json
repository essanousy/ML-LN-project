It\u2019d have been better if we were to fight now though.\u2019</p><br/><p>But it\u2019ll be a huge loss if he didn\u2019t get the thing he was going for while following that guy around.</p><br/><p>He might\u2019ve skinned him off slowly, like peeling an apple, and destroyed him if it wasn\u2019t for the structure of the islands but this was not possible since there were set islands which he had to go to.</p><br/><p>He had to differentiate clearly between the main mission and sub-missions.</p><br/><p>And his path wasn\u2019t clear anyway since there were almost no survivors.</p><br/><p>Since everyone who had met with his clan had died.</p><br/><p>So he had focused on the dungeon first.</p><br/><p>But there was one place where his objectives of the Final Dungeon and that guy\u2019s path would cross for sure.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>A place where the biggest amount of Lords had gathered.</p><br/><p>And a place where you could massacre a large amount of Lords if you use a Fraud Lord.</p><br/><p>If he had some form of logic then he would\u2019ve taken the Lords as hostage and would have used their forces but this guy would kill them all since he hated them to no end.</p><br/><p>Hansoo had never stopped being on guard against the Tower even when he was hunting.</p><br/><p>He had set them up so they grouped and guarded against each other and had always hunted near the dungeon so he could rush back because he didn\u2019t know which one of the twelve was the Fraud Lord.</p><br/><p>Since the hardness of Crystal was not something somebody normal could smash, it was only because it was him that he was able to smash it apart.</p><br/><p>\u2018I had thought that he didn\u2019t exist because he didn\u2019t come out\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>It seemed like he had been looking for the final chance like Keldian had said.</p><br/><p>And because of this Hansoo had never created a dangerous situation.</p><br/><p>Since it wasn\u2019t possible for him to act when there was no danger.</p><br/><p>\u2018But it\u2019s a little too much to do that while fighting Demon Lord.\u2019</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t sure because the decision of using up all their mini-crystals was a very reasonable method but Guktae was the Fraud Lord.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s see. How do I deal with this.\u2019</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t stay away from the Demon Lord for a long time.</p><br/><p>If this guy gets released then all the Special Forces would get shredded.</p><br/><p>And if he were to dash up there then they just needed to do one thing.</p><br/><p>They would make the other clansmen attack him by threatening the Lords held hostage.</p><br/><p>\u2018It would be troublesome if that happens. First\u2026 I will open a path for you to live.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo smiled as he shouted loudly while continuing to fight the Demon Lord.</p><br/><p>\u201cWoah. Don\u2019t get too excited. Calm down for a second.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Guktae, who was about to order the Special Forces to cut off the Lord\u2019s heads, flinched at these words.</p><br/><p>\u2018What else could he do in such a situation?\u2019</p><br/><p>Guktae had unconsciously gotten curious because Hansoo was such a unique guy.</p><br/><p>And the next answer was something which exceeded his calculations.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s trade. You wouldn\u2019t want to die either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Guktae flinched at these words.</p><br/><p>Who in the world wanted to die.</p><br/><p>He was acting like this because he couldn\u2019t go against his Lord\u2019s orders.</p><br/><p>Hansoo spoke as he looked at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are crystals on me. I will give them to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Is he crazy?\u2019</p><br/><p>What kind of nonsense was this?</p><br/><p>Hansoo spoke again.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who your Lord is but wouldn\u2019t it be better to take those Lords and use them instead of killing them all?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone nodded at these words.</p><br/><p>If they take the Lords as hostage then all their forces become part of Guktae\u2019s Lord.</p><br/><p>Since there wasn\u2019t anyone who wouldn\u2019t comply if there was a blade up against their necks.</p><br/><p>Hansoo spoke as he looked at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe terms are very simple. First, you take the Lords up with the crystals. Then you threaten the Lords up there and order the special forces to kill the Demon Lord with me. Simple right? Then every force here can go through the crystal and survive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen your Lord is basically gaining nine Lord\u2019s worth of forces. And I get to hunt the Demon Lord.</p><br/><p>The remaining people could survive. It\u2019s a win-win. Even you can live. It was tiring anyway because the others were pulling their forces back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Guktae clicked his tongue inwardly.</p><br/><p>His words were wrong.</p><br/><p>Since his Lord had hated Lords to the point where it was weird.</p><br/><p>If these guys go up then they would all die.</p><br/><p>But the temptation of crystals were too strong.</p><br/><p>And something else which was even more alluring.</p><br/><p>\u2018If I go up, hunt the Demon Lords with the clansmen of these guys and kill him by attacking his back at the last moment?\u2019</p><br/><p>Would they be able to resist if he orders them with blades against their throats.</p><br/><p>Take the forces of the Nine Lords up, use them for a while, kill them off, collect their artifacts and runes and give them to Wongyung and kill the Lords too.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s perfect.\u2019</p><br/><p>But the one who had moved first was Taejin who had been fighting with him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHansoo man. How can you trust him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Guktae shrugged at Taejin\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>It seemed like they have seen through his thoughts already so it was time for him to push strongly.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t trust me then. If you don\u2019t want to then we\u2019ll just kill the nine according to the plans and I can also just die like that. And the remaining 1000 here would all die. Maybe it\u2019s not even 1000 anymore. I\u2019m not sure if you guys can hold out, it seems like there\u2019s still 20 minutes left.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 This son of a bitch.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn retards\u2026 getting caught as hostages.\u2019</p><br/><p>Their actions weren\u2019t to Taejin\u2019s liking from the start but he didn\u2019t fail to disappoint until the end.</p><br/><p>Hansoo chuckled at Guktae.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take it that you agree then. Take them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Guktae, who had received the crystals which Hansoo had thrown carefully using the special forces, hurriedly used the crystals and the 10 special forces, 9 Lords and Guktae started to get covered in light.</p><br/><p>\u2018Goodness\u2026 for it to play out so easily.\u2019</p><br/><p>Guktae cheered inwardly as he selected the destination point.</p><br/><p>\u2018Destination is\u2026 Island of the Tower!\u2019</p><br/><p>The light which came out from the mini-crystals soon covered the 20 of them and soon afterwards they coudln\u2019t be seen within the Demon Castle anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Dammit. I don\u2019t care anymore then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry too much. He looked pretty naive. He will keep his promise.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo, who had shrugged his shoulders, looked up at the Island of the Tower and then shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s done. It seemed like he wanted to live. He would have realized that some things were fishy if he had thought about it for a moment.\u2019</p><br/><p>But he had cleared it.</p><br/><p>\u2018It seems like I can focus a little bit now. If he is that guy\u2019s subordinate then\u2026 he would go to the Island of the Tower.\u2019</p><br/><p>And it didn\u2019t matter because he had already worked on that separately.</p><br/><p>Hansoo finished his thoughts and turned around.</p><br/><p>Then he started to slash apart the Demon Lord seriously</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Hoooouug</p><br/><p>The disappeared Lords, Special forces and Guktae had appeared within a dark space while bathing in light.</p><br/><p>A location where they moved to if the mini-crystals were activated.</p><br/><p>\u2018Perfect.\u2019</p><br/><p>Two Lords had survived but it wouldn\u2019t be easy for them to survive either.</p><br/><p>Since he would give the orders now.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like you would need to comply for now. Hurry and give the order. First attack the Demon Lord and once you kill it, attack Hansoo.\u201d</p><br/><p>The special forces pushed the blades against the Lords\u2019 necks.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Lords nodded despite clicking their tongue.</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t do anything else because they were held hostage but it seemed like he wouldn\u2019t kill them.</p><br/><p>They could always look out for chances as long as they were alive.</p><br/><p>\u2018Dumbasses.\u2019</p><br/><p>And this was why his Lord was trying to get rid of them whenever he had the chance.</p><br/><p>He could already hear their eyeballs rolling about. (*TL: Korean Saying for planning things out)</p><br/><p>While Guktae was smiling, a man\u2019s voice was heard behind them, who were on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh. Look at these guys.\u201d</p><br/><p>When they turned around quickly, a person with a weird mask was approaching them.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man smiled as he was about to speak out his name but then stopped.</p><br/><p>Then there would be no point of putting the mask on.</p><br/><p>He had disguised himself in order to not show the relationship between him and Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u2018But they really did come? He had told me that they would come if I waited here.\u2019</p><br/><p>The man spoke out after mumbling inwardly for a while.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not like the psychic power is being marvelous only once or twice.</p><br/><p>He just needed to do what he needed to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm\u2026 no need for names. We won\u2019t be seeing each other for long anyway.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018I just need to cut off their necks and take the things that come out right?\u2019</p><br/><p>Kudududk.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis crazy bastard!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangjin, who had cut off a Lord\u2019s neck with one swing of his sword, laughed coldly at Guktae who was screaming.</p><br/><p>KobatoChan\u2019s Note</p><br/><p>The Reincarnator\u2019s \u201cRegular\u201d chapters are scheduled for the Wednesday, Friday, Sunday and/or Saturday.

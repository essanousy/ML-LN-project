There\u2019s a few guys copying me.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo shook his head towards the few clansmen who he could see in the distance.</p><br/><p>It\u2019ll all be in vain.</p><br/><p>Once all the surface around here gets crushed and the Demon Mouth completely fills this place up, those guys will be given two choices.</p><br/><p>To either drown by going into the Outer Mouth where the toxic waters were going into.</p><br/><p>Or to go into the Inner Mouth before the entrance closes and fight with the beasts.</p><br/><p>Once these things close their mouths then they\u2019ll all get swallowed even if they\u2019re bouncing atop the teeth.</p><br/><p>\u2018A moment is more than enough.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo, who jumped in place a single time, pulled something out from his pouch.</p><br/><p>A small Divine Stone Fragment which was the size of a rice grain.</p><br/><p>Hansoo took a glance at the Divine Stone Fragment and then scooped up a bit of the baby\u2019s heart from his pouch.</p><br/><p>\u2018I need to use it a bit at a time.\u2019</p><br/><p>He needed to use the heart as the poison to catch the third guy of the Pillar.</p><br/><p>Hansoo, who had scooped up a small amount of the heart, tied the Divine Stone Fragment and the baby\u2019s heart piece together and then threw it into the mouth where the toxic waters were getting sucked into.</p><br/><p>Plop.</p><br/><p>Soon the fragment swept down the waters as it disappeared into the outer tunnel.</p><br/><p>Kugugugugugugu.</p><br/><p>Once it had almost drank up all of the waters in the Kukulja lake, it started to slowly close its mouth.</p><br/><p>Though it would rise back up because it was connected to the sea but those things had drunk so viciously that it had almost dried up.</p><br/><p>Though it was wide, it wasn\u2019t very deep so it could not quench their thirst.</p><br/><p>Kuuuuuuuu</p><br/><p>Hansoo landed on the inner tunnel as he saw the mouth close.</p><br/><p>Kyaaa!</p><br/><p>A large amount of beasts had already set up camp there.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well. This is just the starting point.\u2019</p><br/><p>Maybe because they were located in the outermost Root but the difficulty of the beasts were not high.</p><br/><p>Of course they will continue to gather up to him if he were to continue to fight back and forth here.</p><br/><p>\u2018Get through them quickly.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo extended the blade of his sword and then swung it in all directions.</p><br/><p>Chhguguguguk.</p><br/><p>Kyaaaaaa!</p><br/><p>The Gertas dropped artifacts and runes in all directions as they got cut in halves.</p><br/><p>Kyaaaa!</p><br/><p>Hansoo endlessly picked up the things that were dropped as he continued forward.</p><br/><p>This guy\u2019s Root was quite similar to the World Tree.</p><br/><p>As you went further and further up, the smaller roots would combine into each other as they become bigger.</p><br/><p>And of course stronger beasts appeared the higher you went.</p><br/><p>Hansoo held onto the Galadriang\u2019s Relic, , and quickly headed upwards.</p><br/><p>At that moment a sound of things getting slashed apart could be heard approaching him.</p><br/><p>Kudududuk.</p><br/><p>Ududuk.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s about time we meet.\u2019</p><br/><p>They had separated into different mouths.</p><br/><p>Of course they would meet as they head upwards while killing the beasts since the roots combined.</p><br/><p>A person who was walking while swinging a giant sword and slashing the beasts apart could be seen in the distance.</p><br/><p>\u2018A bit below Kalz Morenn? Is he the new captain of the shock troopers?\u2019</p><br/><p>And he could see somebody walking next to him with a cold expression in protection.</p><br/><p>\u2018He\u2019s the captain of Lighthouse huh. Is that guy Michael?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo suddenly thought of Keldian\u2019s show off.</p><br/><p>Seeing that he hadn\u2019t died and was collecting the forces proved that his skills were quite good.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well. I\u2019ll try. Keldian.\u2019</p><br/><p>It would\u2019ve been different if they hadn\u2019t crossed roads in the first place but since it has become like this, it was better to have a good relationship.</p><br/><p>Since they\u2019re now on the same boat.</p><br/><p>It was some extra people who weren\u2019t part of his plan but it wouldn\u2019t hurt since they wanted to help.</p><br/><p>\u2018Anyways this is unexpected. I thought the Clan Lord would have escaped.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo greeted the captain of the shock troopers who had an expression that wanted to send over a skill at any moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it much better seeing me in a place like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What are you thinking?\u201d</p><br/><p>Michael answered Hansoo\u2019s question instead of the captain of the shock troopers.</p><br/><p>Since he could not figure out what Hansoo was thinking of.</p><br/><p>\u2018No. I can\u2019t even tell if he\u2019s a newcomer or not.\u2019</p><br/><p>At first he was befuddled, then he was enraged and then he was curious.</p><br/><p>The reason why he had rated this Hansoo guy in front of him highly was partially because of his battle prowess but mainly due to his unknown intelligence.</p><br/><p>Since he had heard that this Hansoo guy had prepared everything perfectly in order to kill the Calamity Fish.</p><br/><p>And had successfully done so.</p><br/><p>But coming in here without any preparations was not part of his plan.</p><br/><p>He might\u2019ve understood it if that guy had actually tackled through them, escaped this place with some unknown method and left them behind to fight while buying some time.</p><br/><p>But for him to come into the mouth with them?</p><br/><p>\u2018Does he have the confidence to escape this at any time?\u2019</p><br/><p>Michael shook his head.</p><br/><p>The first thing they had done earlier was pouring attacks at it trying to penetrate through this thing\u2019s skin.</p><br/><p>But it was for naught.</p><br/><p>The skin was so hard that the attacks didn\u2019t even work properly and when they made a decent sized hole, the toxic waters that this thing had drunk rushed in at a rapid pace.</p><br/><p>Even if they did go through it, they\u2019ll just get swept by.</p><br/><p>They thought of escaping while this guy opened its mouth to drink the toxic waters but gave that idea up once they heard the outside clansmen\u2019s message.</p><br/><p>Since the people who had been sucked inside the Root were doing the same thing.</p><br/><p>And the message said that no one had come out.</p><br/><p>If the whole clan was to use up all their forces, a few people including himself would be able to get out but he didn\u2019t want to get out this way.</p><br/><p>And that was why he had come to find this guy.</p><br/><p>With hopes of him having some plans.</p><br/><p>Hansoo laughed as he saw that Michael.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you wanted to kill this thing? I\u2019ve done this to fulfill your wish.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026With just these numbers? We\u2019ll get trampled on the way there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Michael made a helpless expression.</p><br/><p>They only had about 150 people including all of the Search Teams and the Shock Troopers.</p><br/><p>Of course these guys were the elites of the elites in the Red Zone.</p><br/><p>But if it could be solved with just this then why would it be called a Calamity.</p><br/><p>They will all get crushed apart by the ones coming down on the way up.</p><br/><p>Hansoo shook his head at Michael\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be easier to do it now.\u201d</p><br/><p>With those words, a very faint vibration could be felt from far away.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>An extremely large underground cavity.</p><br/><p>A large factory shaped building was located near below the World Tree.</p><br/><p>Something that seemed like a relic of a highly intelligent race, a building that seemed like the product of modern technology was now covered with unknown mucus and suspicious looking roots.</p><br/><p>Like symbolizing the Elvenheim who had lost and gone extinct.</p><br/><p>But surprisingly, the which was a core part of the Elvenheim was still maintaining its function despite being covered in numerous strange things.</p><br/><p>Kiiiiiiiiiiiiik.</p><br/><p>And in the hundreds of millions of Cultivating Containers within the Plant, things were constantly getting produced.</p><br/><p>Though they weren\u2019t being used properly under what the Elvenheims wanted.</p><br/><p>&lt;!!!!!!&gt;</p><br/><p>The main body of the who had spread his Devil\u2019s Mouth in all direction with the plant under his full control made a joyous sound.</p><br/><p>Since he could feel his mouths penetrating through the earth and having reached the sea.</p><br/><p>Sucking the toxic waters of the World Tree was quite a lot but sucking it directly from the sea was completely different in terms of quantity.</p><br/><p>The toxic water that had multiplied a few times in quantity was constantly getting transferred to it.</p><br/><p>The Main body then got those toxic waters and then focused on his main job.</p><br/><p>&lt;!!!!!!&gt;</p><br/><p>It took a part of it and used it to fill its stomach.</p><br/><p>Then it poured the remaining toxic waters into the which he had infected.</p><br/><p>Soon the Divine Stone Fragment which was embedded within the core of the made a blinding light as it started to pour out an amazing amount of energy.</p><br/><p>Kurururururuk.</p><br/><p>A huge amount of energy and toxic waters were being supplied to the Plant.</p><br/><p>&lt;!!!!&gt;</p><br/><p>The Plant, which was able to send out beasts all around the World Tree Mountain Range despite having a lack of energy and toxic waters, shined brightly in red with the plentiful amount of toxic waters and energy as if it could now work to its fullest and started up.</p><br/><p>Chiiiiik.</p><br/><p>The Plant, which was the result of Elvenheim\u2019s alchemistry, started to create a huge amount of beasts according to the saved DNA information.</p><br/><p>In numbered many many times larger than usual.</p><br/><p>Kurururuk.</p><br/><p>The main body happily stimulated the fragment more as it sucked in the toxic waters more fervently.</p><br/><p>Kiiiiik.</p><br/><p>The beasts who woke up from the Cultivating Containers inside the Plant made confused expressions but then made vicious roars as they spread out through the Root\u2019s tunnels.</p><br/><p>So they could fulfill their objectives.</p><br/><p>Kwarururu.</p><br/><p>Inside that Plant, millions of Ghweche seeds were endlessly pouring in while sucking in the nearby toxic waters.</p><br/><p>By the time the arrived balloons gathered around a certain location inside, the divine stone fragment that Hansoo mad mixed in and sent up was almost about to explode.</p><br/><p>Since though it was dead, the baby heart piece had constantly stimulated the fragment to give off energy.</p><br/><p>Soon the fragment which had reached its limit started to pour out a huge amount of energy in all directions.</p><br/><p>Chiiiiiik.</p><br/><p>The moment the extremely bright light, which had the ability to scorch Hansoo through his Reinforcement before, touched the surrounding toxic waters, the waters turned into vapor instantly.</p><br/><p>And the toxic vapor that had remained after caught on fire.</p><br/><p>Then an explosive chain reaction happened.</p><br/><p>Booboobooom!</p><br/><p>The gas lit on fire and the explosion from the gas blew up the nearby balloons.</p><br/><p>The toxic waters evaporated from the explosion and then more gasses came out.</p><br/><p>&lt;!!!!!!!!!!!!!&gt;</p><br/><p>The main body which was fully immersed in controlling the Devil\u2019s mouth in order to suck in the Toxic Waters looked at the Plant which had turned into a sea of flames and roared out in rage.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>Crunch.</p><br/><p>The people flinched as they saw the tunnel of the Root shrink suddenly.</p><br/><p>Since it felt like the Root had been enraged.</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded as he saw this.</p><br/><p>\u2018It blew up properly.\u2019</p><br/><p>Of course killing the main body with such an explosion was just in his dreams.</p><br/><p>Since the main body was not weak like that.</p><br/><p>But that plant would\u2019ve been destroyed to the point where it would not be able to function temporarily.</p><br/><p>According to the information he had received from the Elvenheim he had met in the Abyss, the durability of the Plant was not that high.</p><br/><p>Since their race didn\u2019t have any enemies during the time they ruled this world.</p><br/><p>\u2018We have to move while the Plant is stopped.\u2019</p><br/><p>The Plant which was condensed from the technology of the Elvenheim was sadly made too well.</p><br/><p>It would recover after a while and then completely focus on creating beasts.</p><br/><p>They had to tackle through during the time when the new supply of beasts had been cut off and get to the Main Body.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Michael looked at Hansoo with an expression full of suspicion.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026What did he do? Does he know what\u2019s at the end of this Root?\u2019</p><br/><p>From the way he was speaking it seemed like his plans had succeeded.</p><br/><p>Michael did not understand this.</p><br/><p>No one knew what the main body of the Devil\u2019s Mouth was or what would come out at the end of this tunnel.</p><br/><p>But how did Hansoo know of it to set up such a plan?</p><br/><p>Many thoughts flashed by Michael\u2019s head but the conclusion came out rather quickly.</p><br/><p>\u2018I just need to focus on getting out of this place.\u2019</p><br/><p>As long as that guy was not suicidal he would\u2019ve prepared a method of surviving.</p><br/><p>If not, then they\u2019ll blame him for that when the time comes .</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. Prepare your formations. Shock Troopers stand in the front.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since Hansoo was doing his part, he needed to do his own part.</p><br/><p>If he were to fight with that guy because of his pride and make Hansoo lead them onto a strange path then they\u2019ll only receive damage.</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded while looking at Michael who started to control his clan.</p><br/><p>\u2018You made a wise decision.\u2019</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t want to fight a bloodbath with these guys here either.</p><br/><p>Every grain of battle power was precious.</p><br/><p>Hansoo quickly stored the small Divine Stone Fragment that he had made for emergencies as he quickly moved his footsteps.</p><br/><p>\u2018Collect two Relics that are here on the way there.\u2019</p><br/><p>The Relics of two of the Five Great TIger Generals who had died after coming in here in order to retrieve the Plant.</p><br/><p>With those he would have three in total including the Galadriang\u2019s Relic he had.</p><br/><p>If that were to happen then he wouldn\u2019t need to think much anymore.</p><br/><p>Since he would be able to use the Relics properly then.</p><br/><p>Hansoo started to proceed head on.</p><br/><p>Proofreader\u2019s note</p><br/><p>This is a bonus chapter (and this is NOT a prank this time).</p><br/><p>In this chapter we see that the Calamity Fish\u2019s death would create an overwhelming army of monsters invading the World Tree \u2013 why Hansoo had to act quickly. I don\u2019t get why the Root couldn\u2019t just suck toxic waters from the sea far away from the Calamity Fish, but maybe it doesn\u2019t have any way of noticing the fish closing in if it did\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It didn\u2019t actually stop.\u2019</p><br/><p>The world hadn\u2019t actually stopped.</p><br/><p>His conscious had accelerated to such a degree that it felt like the surroundings had stopped.</p><br/><p>And he knew who had done this.</p><br/><p>In the center of the stopped world.</p><br/><p>Somebody walked towards Hansoo who was frozen.</p><br/><p>A very beautiful female with golden hair.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a first huh? Seeing me like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>&lt;...Is this your original appearance?&gt;</p><br/><p>Because Hansoo couldn\u2019t move his lips, he thought of the words he wanted to say instead.</p><br/><p>It was the first time seeing her but he knew who she was.</p><br/><p>The Ain who had her hand on the stake and the flail in the distance.</p><br/><p>Hansoo mumbled as he stared at the female walking towards him with a completely different form unlike her original evanescent body.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, having more divine powers increases the things I can do. Creating a form for the sake of conversation is a piece of cake\u2026 Do you want one as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Whoooosh.</p><br/><p>Another Hansoo appeared next to the frozen Hansoo.</p><br/><p>Hansoo moved with his new body as he spoke with the Ain.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are the Seer right?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Ain nodded as it spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me introduce myself. My name is Mudusella.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow brave. For you to come out personally.\u201d</p><br/><p>Acting alone increased the chance of her death vastly.</p><br/><p>And Mudusella had experienced two different near death cases.</p><br/><p>One during the fight against Arthus Krancheska.</p><br/><p>And just now.</p><br/><p>Mudusella shrugged at Hansoo\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too much for the other Ains to handle.\u201d</p><br/><p>If a normal Ain had come instead of her, everything would\u2019ve been finished here and now.</p><br/><p>So she had come personally.</p><br/><p>To twist the future and turn in into the direction she wanted.</p><br/><p>\u201c You should've just come out from the beginning.\u201d:</p><br/><p>If Mudusella had helped from the beginning, he could\u2019ve thought up of many more plans.</p><br/><p>Mudusella chuckled.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think being a Seer is an easy job? If I\u2019m always in my original persona then I would\u2019ve long become insane.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was why she had to use a fake persona.</p><br/><p>To protect herself from the countless sights of the future.</p><br/><p>If not then she wouldn\u2019t be able to handle such a long period of a thousand years.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t complain so much. This is the best I can do. And the other persona is better for fighting anyway. I don\u2019t like fighting that much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her body remained the same even when her personas switched.</p><br/><p>Since the level remained.</p><br/><p>Which meant the other persona, which was filled with a decent amount of rage and fear, was much more suited for it.</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded at Mudusella\u2019s reply.</p><br/><p>\u2018Anyhow...The seer huh\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>He had never seen the Seer, he had only heard about the rumors.</p><br/><p>And for her to use divine powers to do things like this.</p><br/><p>\u2018Anyways, I can catch a breather I guess.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you close the dimensional gate?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mudusella nodded at Hansoo and Hansoo sighed in relief.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ok then.\u2019</p><br/><p>Though everybody had stopped, the time was still flowing.</p><br/><p>It was very slow but Tiamet\u2019s finger was pointing towards him and was preparing to send out a beam of destruction.</p><br/><p>But if they could forcibly close the dimensional gate then the initial problems would be solved.</p><br/><p>\u2018Anyway...This is a tremendous strength.\u2019</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Mudusella spoke to Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have a lot to ask you. And things I\u2019m curious about as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiiiiiiiiiiing.</p><br/><p>The formation started to shine with a strange noise.</p><br/><p>Amidst the stopped world.</p><br/><p>The stunningly beautiful Mudusella looked at Hansoo expressionlessly above the glowing formation and spoke to Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t have the qualifications to intrude in this world yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded at those words.</p><br/><p>He had realized from the previous encounter.</p><br/><p>Tiamet.</p><br/><p>And Mudusella in front of him.</p><br/><p>As well as the other powerhouses of the Kingdoms and the Empire.</p><br/><p>He and the others didn\u2019t have the qualifications yet.</p><br/><p>As Mudusella saw Hansoo\u2019s stern expression, she smiled and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo have a good trip.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Hansoo frowned at Mudusella\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Booooom!</p><br/><p>The energy of the mana node.</p><br/><p>The powers of the stake and the flail swirled around together.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s body started to glow with a golden light.</p><br/><p>And he knew what this phenomenon was.</p><br/><p>\u201c...Teleportation?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Hansoo frowned.</p><br/><p>Mudusella laughed and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou see, I was the one who set up all the Warp Gates.\u201d</p><br/><p>As her words ended.</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s body started to disappear.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you\u2019d just die if you go like this...I\u2019ll give you a gift.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mudusella touched the chest of the frozen Hansoo next to the avatar created for conversation.</p><br/><p>Ooooooong.</p><br/><p>A shining symbol appeared atin the center of his chest.</p><br/><p>\u201c...Ain\u2019s blessing.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Hansoo mumbled.</p><br/><p>Mudusella smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave a safe trip. Don\u2019t forget to hurry. I\u2019ll try to handle this place but...There isn\u2019t much time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shaaaaaaaak!</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s avatar disappeared and his spirit moved back into his real body.</p><br/><p>And Mudusella caressed Hansoo\u2019s cheeks while mumbling.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd\u2026 I thank you for helping our race. We\u2019ll take care of your race until you come back.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Mudusella\u2019s hands moved away.</p><br/><p>Chchchchchchchhhhh.</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s body disappeared completely and not even a trace remained.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Boooooooom!</p><br/><p>The frozen consciouses were released and time continued to flow again.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Boooooom!</p><br/><p>Tiamet frowned as he watched the gate closing.</p><br/><p>He could still see through it since it had yet to close completely but it was too difficult to interfere anymore.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tsk. Is this as far as I can do.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tiamet smirked at Mudusella who was now staring at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cMudusella. You\u2019re still a coward huh. Are you still hiding behind the fake persona?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...\u201d</p><br/><p>The Ain slowly closed her eyes as she spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat man will lead us. You and I...A thousand years is a long time to live.\u201d</p><br/><p>Maybe it was because she had used too much strength. Her persona was slowly sinking down.</p><br/><p>\u2018...I have to deal with this as quick as possible.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tiamet chuckled at Mudusella\u2019s words while she was closing the gate with her remaining strength.</p><br/><p>He got his mouth right up to the closing gate and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did you send him?\u201d</p><br/><p>But Mudusella didn\u2019t reply.</p><br/><p>Since it was becoming hard to maintain her persona.</p><br/><p>She merely mumbled inside her head.</p><br/><p>\u2018To our origin.\u2019</p><br/><p>The spirit lands.</p><br/><p>Beyond the northern lands.</p><br/><p>The land that hadn\u2019t been touched for the past thousand years.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Please.\u2019</p><br/><p>Mudusella looked towards the direction Hansoo was teleported to and closed her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>A land where a blizzard was raging.</p><br/><p>Above the vast frozen land.</p><br/><p>Kiiiiiing.</p><br/><p>A strange golden light started to appear.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Zooooooooongg!</p><br/><p>A man appeared from thin air.</p><br/><p>And the moment he appeared.</p><br/><p>Crash.</p><br/><p>\u201cCough..Ugh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo coughed up blood as he laid flat on the floor.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Damn.\u2019</p><br/><p>As he dropped his guard, the fatigue of the battle swept through his body.</p><br/><p>Though the mastery level of the Nine Dragons Spear had risen, it still turned his body into a wreck.</p><br/><p>And he had to handle Tiamet with such a body.</p><br/><p>Though it was just a finger, that sole finger was more than enough to erase an entire clan.</p><br/><p>\u2018Where did she send\u2026 No, I can guess to a degree.\u2019</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know where exactly he was.</p><br/><p>But there was only one place which had a natural environment like this.</p><br/><p>Spirit Land.</p><br/><p>A place where hundreds of different extreme natural environments existed.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just as simple as being cold or hot.</p><br/><p>This environment was powerful enough to even erase a master tier player if they didn\u2019t have the Protection Elixir with them.</p><br/><p>No matter how strong Hansoo was, it would be impossible for him to even last a minute in his current situation.</p><br/><p>Ooooong.</p><br/><p>\u2018Blessing.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo smiled as he looked at the strange symbol embedded in the center of his chest.</p><br/><p>This symbol was blocking off the storm swirling around him.</p><br/><p>No, it wasn\u2019t really blocking it off but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s like persuading it.\u2019</p><br/><p>It felt like the symbol was calming down the raging blizzard.</p><br/><p>Saying that this man was not its enemy.</p><br/><p>And thanks to this, Hansoo\u2019s body was able to not receive further damages.</p><br/><p>But that was it.</p><br/><p>He was still in a dangerous situation.</p><br/><p>\u2018...It\u2019ll take a bit to recover.\u2019</p><br/><p>Udududuk</p><br/><p>The Mana Jade that had overheated to the point of almost melting down was slowly coming back and the broken bones and ripped muscles were slowly regenerating.</p><br/><p>As Hansoo raised his body up.</p><br/><p>Roaaaaaarrrrr!</p><br/><p>A tremendous roar was heard from the distant tundra.</p><br/><p>And the moment Hansoo heard this.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Azure Ice Tiger.\u2019</p><br/><p>Azure Ice Tiger.</p><br/><p>A demonic beast which ate up the spirit stones located all over the Spirit Land and succeeded in absorbing the vast amount of ice energy which allowed it to fully adapt to these harsh conditions.</p><br/><p>All demonic beasts that lived here were like this.</p><br/><p>Things that decided to eat the Spirit Stones in order to survive in this place.</p><br/><p>Of course every one of them were powerful.</p><br/><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><br/><p>The level of the Azure Ice Tiger that was charging towards this location was about 270.</p><br/><p>It wouldn\u2019t be an issue if he was in perfect condition but not now.</p><br/><p>No, even then he would only be able to handle one and not the countless others that would smell the blood and charge over.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fuck\u2026 I don\u2019t know why the hell she sent me here!\u2019</p><br/><p>Though he was worried about the situation of the Kingdom, and the fight between the Ains and the Empire, surviving in this place was the highest priority.</p><br/><p>As Hansoo looked around urgently.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Light!\u2019</p><br/><p>From the distance.</p><br/><p>He could see a blinking light in the center of the tundra.</p><br/><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><br/><p>Hansoo quickly started to dash through the raging blizzard and towards the flickering light.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

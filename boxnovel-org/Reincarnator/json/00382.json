I will kill you as painfully as possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014kaduk\u2014 </p><br/><p>Elis tightly clenched the spike in her hand that had been modified to inflict as much pain upon oneself as possible.</p><br/><p>It was a spike made to use her Trait in the most efficient manner.</p><br/><p>Various sharp objects like saw teeth and fish hooks were attached to it.</p><br/><p>The spike had been a great help in her use of her Trait up until this point.</p><br/><p>But unlike herself, who cannot feel pain, it would be a horrifying experience for Kiriel.</p><br/><p>\u2014oooooong!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2018Right, I have to blow it up as well.\u2019</p><br/><p>Kiriel looked at Elis who had stood up and was now on guard.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn\u2026 I was wondering why she wasn\u2019t using it.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo had told them\u2026 </p><br/><p>To be careful of something that the siblings had called a soul fragment.</p><br/><p>Kiriel had assumed Elis hadn\u2019t received one since she hadn\u2019t used it up until this point, but it seems that wasn\u2019t the case.</p><br/><p>\u2018My situation isn\u2019t that great, either.\u2019</p><br/><p>Kiriel looked at the various parts of her body currently flowing with blood and frowned.</p><br/><p>The Dragon God Armor had countless holes and broken parts.</p><br/><p>And that spike that pierced through her armor was made in such a way that it took away a huge part of her flesh everytime it stabbed her.</p><br/><p>Although she had the more advantageous situation, if Elis used her soul fragment then Kiriel would get killed no matter what.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn\u2026 Do I need to run away?\u2019</p><br/><p>Kiriel clenched her teeth.</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t do that.</p><br/><p>Elis wondered why the attacks from Nelkipa\u2019s skin had stopped, but Kiriel knew.</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin.</p><br/><p>She was suppressing the crystal.</p><br/><p>The crystal that was radiating a terrifying amount of energy.</p><br/><p>If that girl\u2019s brother was at a similar level as her, then Enbi Arin would be in a bad state as well.</p><br/><p>No, she might even be in a worse state.</p><br/><p>And she was suppressing the crystal in such a state.</p><br/><p>By herself.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn\u2026 Her body is going to overload.\u2019</p><br/><p>She could not let Enbi Arin take on that burden by herself.</p><br/><p>Winning wasn\u2019t the main priority.</p><br/><p>If she ran away and Elis started to blow up that crystal, then the burden on Enbi Arin will become twofold of what it is now.</p><br/><p>She had to drag it out as long as possible.</p><br/><p>Kiriel clenched her teeth and tightly gripped the fang in her hand.</p><br/><p>And Elis laughed at this sight.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha! You want to fight?\u201d</p><br/><p>The soul fragment inside her was growing inside.</p><br/><p>Proof that Taehee had received her signal.</p><br/><p>And the next steps would be simple.</p><br/><p>Taehee would give her strength.</p><br/><p>And she would crush that damned b****.</p><br/><p>Very simple.</p><br/><p>There were some hurdles along the way, but this was it.</p><br/><p>She just needed to go up afterward.</p><br/><p>\u2018Taehee\u2026 Did she become even stronger? Well, it\u2019s good for me.\u2019</p><br/><p>She was envious of Taehee who had climbed up to a level she couldn\u2019t catch up to, especially when they had been at a similar level in the past. But she was happy about it at this moment.</p><br/><p>Since she would soon attain that strength, allowing her to solve the situation.</p><br/><p>But as Elis was smiling at the vibrating soul fragment inside her.</p><br/><p>A change occurred.</p><br/><p>\u2014oooooong!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?...Uhhhh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elis exclaimed in surprise.</p><br/><p>The tremors inside her were calming down.</p><br/><p>This only meant one thing.</p><br/><p>Denial.</p><br/><p>Taehee had denied giving her strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026 Why?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Her disappointment was as great as her anticipation.</p><br/><p>Elis was at a loss.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn\u2026 Did something happen?\u2019</p><br/><p>No matter how she and Taehee disliked each other, not lending her strength in a situation like this didn\u2019t make sense.</p><br/><p>That meant there was only one answer.</p><br/><p>Taehee was in a situation where she could not lend her strength.</p><br/><p>There was no other reason for Taehee to deny giving her strength otherwise.</p><br/><p>But soon\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014Elis realized that there was an even worse issue.</p><br/><p>\u2018F***.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my. It seems that things aren\u2019t going according to your plan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elis looked at Kiriel who was walking towards her with a cold smile.</p><br/><p>And she realized.</p><br/><p>That this was her grave.</p><br/><p>Her body was broken beyond the point of return, and she had lost her final ray of hope.</p><br/><p>And her killer was raging with bloodthirst.</p><br/><p>There was no way for her to survive.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026Did you make me struggle this hard just to get killed off in a place like this? Clementine, this goes against our promise\u2019.</p><br/><p>&gt;.</p><br/><p>Noah.</p><br/><p>The boat of their dreams that would take them to their land of dreams that Clementine had promised her.</p><br/><p>But after losing all hope for the future, the reality she faced was crueler beyond anything else.</p><br/><p>\u2018Shit\u2026 I hope you find a way up at least, Ares.\u2019</p><br/><p>Elis looked around at the vast empty plane around her, and then her eyes locked onto Kiriel.</p><br/><p>Her expression was full of endless despair.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2014booooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo charged at Melchizedek, which smashed him away and laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha! I told you, you won\u2019t be able to win!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014kachak!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The area of the blue armor that Melchizedek had attacked cracked apart and made a strange noise.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo ignored the force of the impact as he swung his hammer at Melchizedek.</p><br/><p>But shockingly\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014despite the hammer flying towards it like a meteor.</p><br/><p>Melchizedek had no thoughts of resisting as it continued to smile and only focused on attacking Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u2014booooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The Mjolnir smashed into Melchizedek\u2019s body and made a huge noise.</p><br/><p>The bright blue armor blew apart, revealing the flesh inside.</p><br/><p>It shredded the Nerpa\u2019s body as bones broke and muscles exploded.</p><br/><p>A force strong enough to crush his organs and his heart.</p><br/><p>Nobody would be able to laugh at a giant hole in their body, but Melchizedek did.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha! How many times is it now? Are you even counting?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014ssssss\u2014 </p><br/><p>The hole on Melchizedek\u2019s body was regenerating at an insane rate.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t even absorbing the bits of flesh and blood around the body to heal.</p><br/><p>It looked like the body was creating something out of nothing.</p><br/><p>Flesh grew back, veins reconnected, and bones regenerated.</p><br/><p>Like an immortal.</p><br/><p>And Melchizedek looked at this scene with satisfaction.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why do you think I gave up my previous immortality for this body?\u2019</p><br/><p>Although this body was needed, if the body itself was extremely weak and would become a factor that tied Melchizedek down in the upcoming war, then it never would\u2019ve come here.</p><br/><p>But it did.</p><br/><p>For one reason.</p><br/><p>This body provided an even better form of immortality.</p><br/><p>\u2018Amazing.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014 </p><br/><p>Melchizedek smiled as it looked at the Nelkipa\u2019s vast energy flowing towards itself.</p><br/><p>Melchizedek\u2019s previous body was a mechanical lifeform, but if all the systems and structures on top of Nelkipa were to be swept away, it was as good as dead.</p><br/><p>But this body was different.</p><br/><p>It continuously received all energy and matter from Nelkipa and regenerated itself.</p><br/><p>As long as it was on top of Nelkipa and the Nelkipa was still alive, it could not die.</p><br/><p>The battle against Hansoo proved this all.</p><br/><p>No matter how similar their physical aspects are.</p><br/><p>There was no way that Melchizedek, which had no battle experience before this, could beat Hansoo who had tempered himself through countless battles.</p><br/><p>But not here.</p><br/><p>Above the Nelkipa.</p><br/><p>It was a god.</p><br/><p>\u2014oooooong\u2014 </p><br/><p>Nelkipa\u2019s skin started moving up and down again.</p><br/><p>And the cannons in the distance started to light up again.</p><br/><p>Melchizedek laughed at this scene.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha! It seems your friends at the crystals are finished!... What shall you do?\u201d</p><br/><p>If, in this already advantageous situation, they took back Nelkipa\u2019s controls?</p><br/><p>There was nothing else to talk about.</p><br/><p>Melchizedek smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to hate yourself so much. Even someone like you wouldn\u2019t have been able to predict a situation like this. This is probably the first time anyone has seen an existence like me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Watch what I do\u2026 with this power.\u2019</p><br/><p>It would be a great scene once he put Hansoo inside a test tube and placed him on the highest point on Nelkipa.</p><br/><p>An even better viewpoint for Hansoo.</p><br/><p>Of course, it\u2019ll only be his eyes that could move.</p><br/><p>But at that moment\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014Hansoo chuckled as he said:</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can it be a first?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo smirked and spat out.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen countless beings regenerate like a cockroach. Just like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the Abyss, there were beings that were even more like cockroaches than Melchizedek.</p><br/><p>Beings who truly deserved the name \u2018Immortal\u2019.</p><br/><p>But the one who had stood up tall in the end.</p><br/><p>The one who smashed them apart one by one and descended the Abyss.</p><br/><p>Was him.</p><br/><p>And as he finished his words\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014the thing he had been saving up until this point.</p><br/><p>The thing he\u2019d saved up by twisting all the muscles and mana inside his body started to squirm violently inside him.</p><br/><p>The final seed inside Hansoo.</p><br/><p>The consciousness stored within the Nine Dragons Strike shouted out in joy.</p><br/><p>And with that shout\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014booooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014the thing he had been continuously spinning and charging around inside him quickly started to spread throughout his body.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

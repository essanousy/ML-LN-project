Use all of the defensive structures and functions of the fortress!\u201d</p><br/><p>Khan screamed out.</p><br/><p>Booom!</p><br/><p>Countless sounds of collisions and explosions were heard.</p><br/><p>The beams the fortresses were shooting towards their inner parts and the attacks of the beings from the Abyss.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Ruummblee.</p><br/><p>Everyone in the green zone was at a loss.</p><br/><p>From the countless spaceships that rose up above the northern tundras.</p><br/><p>[ASTRO-11]</p><br/><p>[ASTRO-71]</p><br/><p>[ASTRO-98]</p><br/><p>[ASTRO-...]</p><br/><p>The spaceships broke apart into nine or so sections and got stuck onto the pillars that came down from the sky.</p><br/><p>But there was an exception.</p><br/><p>[ASTRO-11]</p><br/><p>Unlike the ships that stuck onto the pillars, this single spaceship remained flying above the northern tundra.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem. You\u2019re even going to do our job for us!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo spoke towards the fairy as he stared at the screen he had turned off.</p><br/><p>\u2018That\u2019s enough information.\u2019</p><br/><p>If he let out more then beings even stronger would come down.</p><br/><p>\u201cPhew\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo sighed and then adjusted his posture.</p><br/><p>It was just the beginning.</p><br/><p>The fairy smiled as it spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cShall I then stay away for a bit? Talk between yourselves. We can discuss your reward after.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fairy disappeared with those words and TMT-1, who had been frozen when the fairy had appeared, started to move again.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Two people appeared.</p><br/><p>The two whom he had called earlier.</p><br/><p>The leader of the 2nd grade citizens, Great General Cykrus.</p><br/><p>The leader of the enhanced race, or the Ains, Mudusella.</p><br/><p>And their expressions were filled with fear from what they had seen outside.</p><br/><p>Though they had gone through countless things in their lives, the scene outside was completely unfamiliar to they.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo spoke towards them.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time for us to go our separate ways.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOur separate ways?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. The plan you guys tried to accomplish in the past. Oh wait, I guess only one side knows.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mudusella fell silent.</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s words were true.</p><br/><p>The plan she had made.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>Moving out from this planet and heading towards a new planet where only the enhanced race could live.</p><br/><p>It was impossible in the past.</p><br/><p>Since Tiamet and his Destruction Cannon prevented the spaceships from rising up.</p><br/><p>So she decided to use Hansoo\u2019s hand to deal with the two and then head towards the new planet Tiamet.</p><br/><p>\u2018But...These guys weren\u2019t part of the plan.\u2019</p><br/><p>As Mudusella glanced at Cykrus.</p><br/><p>Hansoo spoke out expressionlessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo with them. You don\u2019t know what would happen on the planet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo wanted to get rid of these guys who could become variables.</p><br/><p>And it wasn\u2019t very hard to do that.</p><br/><p>He just needed to let them proceed with the plan.</p><br/><p>The enhanced race had the spirits and the power to control vast amounts of energy.</p><br/><p>The 2nd citizens, the Kingdoms and the Empire, had a huge amount of manpower and strong elite forces.</p><br/><p>Since they need each other and had similar strength, they wouldn\u2019t be able to deal with each other easily.</p><br/><p>Well, one side wouldn\u2019t just sit idle if the other wanted to leave anyway.</p><br/><p>The people of the Kingdoms and the Empire would not sit still if the Ains wanted to leave.</p><br/><p>It was the same for the 2nd grade citizens.</p><br/><p>Without the enhanced race, they would not be able to maintain the ship all the way to the Tiamet planet far in the distance.</p><br/><p>Mudusella was silent for a moment but then nodded.</p><br/><p>She wanted to leave anyway.</p><br/><p>Though leaving was the original plan, they could\u2019ve come up with a better plan with some time.</p><br/><p>But Mudusella didn\u2019t want to stay on this planet any longer than she had to.</p><br/><p>The aura that the metal pillars were radiating were triggering all of her senses of danger.</p><br/><p>Mudusella spoke towards Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cA few of us who cannot fly decided to stay here. Some can\u2019t survive the long journey...Some don\u2019t want to leave their homeland. They will give you the Ain\u2019s blessings. Though you guys would need to gain the spirits\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Mudusella ended her words and then looked towards the ships that had become part of the elevators.</p><br/><p>The adventurers who had come up and who would come up from now on would probably have a harder time gaining the strength of the spirits.</p><br/><p>Since they would only be able to receive the powers of the spirits after they deal with the strange organisms constantly expanding their territory.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo nodded as if it was not a big deal.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot much reason to do all this if we can\u2019t even manage that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Mudusella became curious.</p><br/><p>What would Hansoo do in this new world?</p><br/><p>\u201c...What will you do now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince my role as the prophet has ended\u2026 I\u2019m planning to go on a vacation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018...Vacation.\u2019</p><br/><p>TMT-1 was dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s words were so shocking, to the point of breaking his calm countenance.</p><br/><p>A vacation amidst all of this?</p><br/><p>\u2018What the hell is he thinking?...\u2019</p><br/><p>TMT-1 frowned as he looked at the adventurers screaming outside the ship.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

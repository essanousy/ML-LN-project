Since they opened a path for us to get strong.\u2019</p><br/><p>But Bart Rien quickly receded his thoughts.</p><br/><p>To thank those bastards who had thrown them into this damnable land.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn\u2026 I\u2019m getting pissed off. I should finish this up quickly.\u2019</p><br/><p>Bart Rien then looked at the Akaron in the distance.</p><br/><p>Though she had thrown away everything that would tell that she was a high ranker, a strange aura was coming off from her.</p><br/><p>It was seen that she was a special person with just a simple glance.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is that the priestess? I guess it\u2019s all over once we catch her.\u2019</p><br/><p>Bart Rien raised his reinforcement and cut off the arm of one of the Akaron warriors in front of him.</p><br/><p>Ssk</p><br/><p>\u201cUaaaaa!\u201d</p><br/><p>Though that guy was strong he was far from dealing with himself, a Baladi level.</p><br/><p>Bart Rien was just about to charge at the priestess after freezing up the warrior\u2019s whole body and kicking him away.</p><br/><p>\u201c!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment he felt all of the hairs on his back stand up.</p><br/><p>Something was approaching from behind him.</p><br/><p>Without even hiding its aura a single bit.</p><br/><p>Everyone who had felt this stopped charging and instinctively wrapped themselves in skills as they escaped outwards.</p><br/><p>Since it was that vicious.</p><br/><p>\u2018These retards!\u2019</p><br/><p>Bart Rien swallowed down the curses that came up to his throat.</p><br/><p>Since he understood.</p><br/><p>He was barely holding on since he was a Baladi level, if he was at their level then he would\u2019ve ran away instantly too.</p><br/><p>Bart Rien rolled his head at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s too late to run.\u2019</p><br/><p>The ones who came here who had enmity against them were only Akarons.</p><br/><p>It was too late to run anyway.</p><br/><p>He needed a hostage.</p><br/><p>Someone important.</p><br/><p>\u2018That one.\u2019</p><br/><p>Bart Rien started to madly rush towards the Priestess in between the childrens in the distance.</p><br/><p>Though the aura was vicious, there was quite a distance between the unknown Akaron and the holder of the aura.</p><br/><p>It would be his win if he caught the Priestess as a hostage before that.</p><br/><p>\u2018I won!\u2019</p><br/><p>Bart Rien\u2019s thoughts ended right there as he arrived in front of the Priestess.</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>Something flew in from the distance, punctured through Bart Rien\u2019s stomach and this caused Bart to lose consciousness and slam into a corner in the distance.</p><br/><p>At that time a green spore that came with the spear exploded out as it spread all around.</p><br/><p>The Crown clansmen who had smelled the spore couldn\u2019t handle the smell as they swirled around a bit and then fell down.</p><br/><p>\u2018The sleep spores work well too.\u2019</p><br/><p>Though it wasn\u2019t easy to get them down, this result was possible because the strong ones had already run away and the weaker ones had already been exhausted from the resistance of the Akaron.</p><br/><p>Hansoo, after seeing the effects of the green spore that he had used in the jail to free Ailen, landed on the ground.</p><br/><p>Booom!</p><br/><p>The Priestess looked at the suddenly appeared Hansoo with an expression of disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cTwo days haven\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk about it, it feels like I\u2019m about to die.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oteon looked at Hansoo, who was cracking various parts of his body, with a surprised expression and then spoke out after a moment of thinking.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you from the bottom of my heart first of all. It seems like we will be able to have a good relationship from now on.\u201d</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t figure out Hansoo\u2019s real intentions just from this.</p><br/><p>But this was the perfect chance to use them or take them.</p><br/><p>There was no reason to help them.</p><br/><p>\u2018I would need to repay this debt no matter what.\u2019</p><br/><p>But the situation wasn\u2019t going to change just because Hansoo appeared.</p><br/><p>Since their warriors were being sacrificed all around them even if this place was solved.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you solve this problem completely?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo pondered for a moment and then shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a bit too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Margoth levels weren\u2019t invincible.</p><br/><p>Though it seemed like the problem here had been solved easily, the other side would have found out about him and act accordingly.</p><br/><p>Their side had more power overall.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well there\u2019s a reason why I came to save these guys at least.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo focused his Demonic Dragon\u2019s Reinforcement and then smashed the petrified flesh of the Gragos that was blocking the emergency exit.</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>A huge hole opened up as the path to the emergency exit the Akarons had prepared opened up.</p><br/><p>Hansoo pointed to the hole as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cRun. I will try to solve as much as I can here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Priestess had to live no matter what.</p><br/><p>He would be able to fight at ease if this Akaron were to go away.</p><br/><p>But the Priestess didn\u2019t leave as she looked at the people laying around in the distance and then spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about this. Help us a bit more. On the other hand\u2026 I will create soldiers for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>While Hansoo was frowning at the unexpected outcome, the Priestess started to pour something into the unconscious people\u2019s mouths.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>\u201cWow!\u201d</p><br/><p>The four Margoth-level people the Crown clan had dispatched for this mission.</p><br/><p>One of them, Bali Roper, shouted out from the attack the Akaron smashed at him.</p><br/><p>Since the force could be felt through his bones despite the high quality defensive artifacts one could only obtain at the and various other defensive skills.</p><br/><p>\u2018They\u2019re really strong.\u2019</p><br/><p>Roper swirled his tongue around.</p><br/><p>A super strong body.</p><br/><p>They were strong even without skills and artifacts.</p><br/><p>If Baladi level guys had gone up against them then their bodies would have been ripped apart.</p><br/><p>This made it more joyous for him.</p><br/><p>\u2018We can now get that strength.\u2019</p><br/><p>Actually victory was slowly being wrestled towards them.</p><br/><p>Though the other side had one more person, those guys were just strong tankers compared to themselves who combined various kinds of skills.</p><br/><p>And one more thing.</p><br/><p>They just needed to sustain this.</p><br/><p>The ones who were restless were the ones in front of them.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hurry and catch them.\u2019</p><br/><p>Once the people they had sent catched the young ones then their victory would be guaranteed.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know about the guys in front of his eyes but there will definitely be ones who give up.</p><br/><p>But Roper felt something weird after a long while of clashing against the five pillars and buying time.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s taking too long.\u2019</p><br/><p>And there wasn\u2019t any communication from the ones whom he had sent.</p><br/><p>Though he thought it was because they were in a dire situation but it took too much time for that.</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>A huge warning rang through Bali Roper\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>A feeling similar to the past when he had gone into the Margoth\u2019s Forest without knowing anything and almost had his body bit apart in two.</p><br/><p>Bali Roper instantly used the skill he had the most pride in, .</p><br/><p>Chujujuuk</p><br/><p>A small black marble appeared in front of Bali Roper and started to suck in everything around him.</p><br/><p>A skill which was related to the dimensional skill he had obtained, a small black hole formed using gravitational waves.</p><br/><p>Of course it was a bit inferior in comparison to a real black hole but its might was not to be trifled with.</p><br/><p>Chuuuuuaaaap</p><br/><p>\u201cKuaaaahh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDumbass! Roper! What are you doing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everything around them was getting sucked towards the Gravitational Orb.</p><br/><p>Even their Crown clansmen and the skills that were flying towards the Akaron.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damnit. Did those guys not figure it out yet?!\u2019</p><br/><p>There was a reason why he didn\u2019t use this skill.</p><br/><p>This skill destroyed teamplay too much and didn\u2019t work well against the Akaron in front of him who were heavy and large.</p><br/><p>And the Akarons were actually standing firm with their legs down in the earth.</p><br/><p>A huge area of effect skill.</p><br/><p>But this wasn\u2019t the time to worry about such things.</p><br/><p>Since the warnings inside his head were too strong for that.</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>Clash</p><br/><p>A golden line flew in from the distance and curved as it smashed onto the Gravitational Orb.</p><br/><p>The black marble had successfully blocked the golden line but gained cracks as a consequence and blew away all the energy it had been absorbing.</p><br/><p>Booom!</p><br/><p>\u201cGoddamit!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bali Roper\u2019s expression froze up as he barely escaped the range of the explosion.</p><br/><p>\u2018There was still a guy like this left?\u2019</p><br/><p>There was no way.</p><br/><p>Why would they have saved such a guy until now?</p><br/><p>At that moment the owner of the golden spear ran up to them and landed.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026A human?\u201d</p><br/><p>Roper made a helpless expression.</p><br/><p>He knew about every Margoth-level adventurers.</p><br/><p>Though the Orange Zone was large, there were barely 20 Margoth-level fighters.</p><br/><p>But he had never even seen or heard of a guy like that.</p><br/><p>At that time somebody ambushed the Crown clansmen who were setting up the formation below.</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis crazy bastards! Why are you attacking us!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Bart Rien! I\u2019m Cole, it\u2019s me Cole! Are you crazy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Roper saw the third force that was charging into their lines and then frowned.</p><br/><p>\u2018Those guys are our clansmen?\u2019</p><br/><p>The ones whom he had sent had gone crazy and were attacking them instead.</p><br/><p>And were integrated in the lines of the Akarons.</p><br/><p>Their movements didn\u2019t look normal either.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026What did they do?\u2019</p><br/><p>While countless unexplainable things were going on one after another, the one who had flown in suddenly spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s end this. Since there\u2019s a lot of things we need to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo thought of the final words of the Priestess, Oteon.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>He wondered what it was since it wasn\u2019t in Elkadion\u2019s memory crystal but it seemed like it had been created after Elkadion left.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t sound that wicked and didn\u2019t seem like it\u2019ll ruin his image.</p><br/><p>Though there were a lot of limits, it seemed very useful for the moment.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo shook his head at the added words of the Priestess.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>Hansoo didn\u2019t really have anything against Tares.</p><br/><p>Since they probably acted in order to survive.</p><br/><p>But it would be different in the Akaron\u2019s perspectives.</p><br/><p>Since all of this damage was due to them.</p><br/><p>\u2018Even if it was an act of survival without any evil intentions\u2026 If that action brought resentment into the world then one needs to prepare to shoulder the consequences.\u2019</p><br/><p>If it was the flaming altar then there was only one solution for them to survive.</p><br/><p>They had to solve it on their own.</p><br/><p>Hansoo finished his thoughts and then looked at the four in front of them.</p><br/><p>\u2018Organize this place\u2026 And then solve the Gragos problem.\u2019</p><br/><p>Bali Roper grinded his teeth as he looked at Hansoo.</p><br/><p>The situation will change completely because of this.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis damned bastard\u2026 A human sticks with the Akaron?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo shrugged his shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen were us humans that close to each other? Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll get close to each other pretty soon enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you saying!\u201d</p><br/><p>The four started to throw skills at Hansoo after hearing the strange words while Hansoo just shrugged his shoulders, retreated behind the five pillars and placed himself in a safe spot.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s really comfortable when there are tankers.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo gathered up all the mana in his body, including the portion he used for defense, as he started to pour it into the Pandemic Blade, latched it onto the Forked Lightning and threw it out.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

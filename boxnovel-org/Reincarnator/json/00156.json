There\u2019s an uproar happening.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the direction where Karhal and the other Hunters had chased Hansoo who had run away.</p><br/><p>Every bit of sound that was ringing out from that location wasn\u2019t simple.</p><br/><p>A noise that wasn\u2019t from a chase but rather a noise that occurred during a clash.</p><br/><p>Which meant that Hansoo had been caught.</p><br/><p>\u2018Which means the result is clear already. Though it\u2019s a pity that I wouldn\u2019t be able to kill him with my own hands\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Well, it didn\u2019t matter much since he was looking at something else that was amusing.</p><br/><p>Chwaaaak</p><br/><p>Keron looked at the 9 Farmers who had been turned into a mess and were lying around him.</p><br/><p>They could still move but they all had something in common.</p><br/><p>That they couldn\u2019t run away no matter what because either their legs or their ankles were broken.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well. Catching 9 is more than enough for myself.\u2019</p><br/><p>Keron looked at Mackill who was still trying to resist and brought up the skill in his hand, .</p><br/><p>A skill that wasn\u2019t as powerful as the Quintuple Beam of the team leader but had a short cast time and couldn\u2019t be dodged so was useful in slowing down their opponents.</p><br/><p>Though the power was a bit weak, it was more than enough against Farmers.</p><br/><p>Kiiiiiiing</p><br/><p>Soon a snake shaped smoke rose up from his hand.</p><br/><p>The moment the smoke rose up.</p><br/><p>Chaajajajak</p><br/><p>\u201cKuuuk\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The purple snake rose up from the ground-like smoke and rose up into the air as it tied around Mackill.</p><br/><p>It seemed like it was swept by, the difference in between the user and the target was always the most important aspect.</p><br/><p>Mackill, whose runes were much lower than Keron, had her skills smashed apart.</p><br/><p>At the same time the artifacts on her body got destroyed and her clothes got ripped.</p><br/><p>Keron laughed happily as he looked at this scene.</p><br/><p>\u201cLivestock doesn\u2019t need clothes. What a nice scene.\u201d</p><br/><p>Keron laughed coldly.</p><br/><p>Since the time has come for his purpose of giving up on Hansoo and coming here was about to get started.</p><br/><p>He needed to punish the leader pig who tried to run away along with the other livestock.</p><br/><p>In front of everyone else.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuu\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mackill saw Keron approaching herself and grasped tightly onto the sword in her hands.</p><br/><p>Of course she knew herself.</p><br/><p>That this was nowhere close to enough.</p><br/><p>Mackill mutted as she thought of Hansoo who had run towards the research lab in the depths of the darkness.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn. When\u2019s it going to be. He didn\u2019t fail right\u2026?\u2019</p><br/><p>This was something she had done while trusting Hansoo.</p><br/><p>Only when Hansoo attained that Sealing Jade would they have some hope.</p><br/><p>But the constant sounds of explosions from the distance weighed down Mackill\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>Since such a large collision shouldn\u2019t occur if everything went according to plan.</p><br/><p>Kuuuugugugugung.</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>Keron, who was approaching Mackill who was staring at him with eyes full of venom, suddenly shrugged his shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you guys resisting anyway? It\u2019s not that bad right? Your lives are safe. And you would\u2019ve become toys of multiple people in the village anyway. Isn\u2019t me being nice to you enough? You don\u2019t want to become like your friend right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Paduk</p><br/><p>Mackill\u2019\u2019s expression froze as she had her body rolled up rightly.</p><br/><p>\u2018This bastard. You dare say those words?\u2019</p><br/><p>Since the reason for her friend\u2019s death was this guy.</p><br/><p>When they had been caught by this guy the moment they got here and was being humiliated.</p><br/><p>Her friend made up her mind to escape.</p><br/><p>She needed to follow her friend.</p><br/><p>Or stop her with her own life on the line.</p><br/><p>Then she wouldn\u2019t have seen her friend\u2019s corpse which had been split into three sections by Keron.</p><br/><p>Mackill\u2019s expression turned extremely cold extremely quickly.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026At least, you cannot.\u2019</p><br/><p>Since things had blown up to this point.</p><br/><p>If Hansoo had failed then there was a high chance that these guys wouldn\u2019t let them go.</p><br/><p>As Mackill made up her mind.</p><br/><p>A skill which she had been saving for a long time started up.</p><br/><p>A skill which burnt up her life force to activate, .</p><br/><p>Kuuururururu</p><br/><p>A tremendous amount of strength that wasn\u2019t available to her usually started to flow through her body.</p><br/><p>Booooom!</p><br/><p>At the same time Mackill, who had been lying on the floor as a mess, jumped back up.</p><br/><p>The moment Mackill focused all her strength onto the sword in her hands and was about to change into Keron.</p><br/><p>Rumble.</p><br/><p>A powerful earthquake rang throughout from somewhere.</p><br/><p>From beneath where they were standing.</p><br/><p>At that same time.</p><br/><p>Hooooooooook</p><br/><p>Formless shockwaves resonated out from the ground and swept Keron and Mackill.</p><br/><p>\u2018Huh?\u2019</p><br/><p>An abnormal looking scene.</p><br/><p>Keron flinched momentarily at the shockwave that rang throughout the entire darkness and then refocused onto Mackill after shaking the thoughts off.</p><br/><p>Since that wasn\u2019t the important part right now.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know what she had done but her aura was not simple.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t threatening but not weak enough where he could let down his guard, a powerful attack.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn. Did she use a sacrificial type skill or something. What a waste.\u2019</p><br/><p>Keron clicked his tongue.</p><br/><p>The sacrificial type skills allowed one to show off a powerful might but took their lives as the price.</p><br/><p>But soon Keron\u2019s expression brightened up.</p><br/><p>\u2018As I expected. She\u2019s scared.\u2019</p><br/><p>The explosive aura that surrounded her body disappeared and only the decisive expression of Mackill could be seen.</p><br/><p>Keron laughed wickedly as he saw this.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yeah, a life is precious.\u2019</p><br/><p>It seemed she had canceled her last skill.</p><br/><p>Keron looked at Mackill leisurely and was about to use his reinforcement.</p><br/><p>It might\u2019ve been different if she had used a skill but this much could easily be blocked with just a reinforcement.</p><br/><p>No, it wouldn\u2019t even be able to get past the defensive skill around his body.</p><br/><p>But at that moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh? Uuuuh! What!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Keron freaked out.</p><br/><p>But Mackill didn\u2019t seem like she wanted to go easy on that Keron as she sharpened her aura even more and flew in.</p><br/><p>And soon.</p><br/><p>Stab.</p><br/><p>Keron freaked out too much as he couldn\u2019t prepare for Mackill charging into him and had let her stab his stomach.</p><br/><p>A very sad result if one thought of the difference in their power levels.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell is this. Kuu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A situation that he had never even thought of being possible.</p><br/><p>Keron grinded his teeth while looking at the longsword stabbed deep into his stomach and then woke up as he smashed Mackill with his hands.</p><br/><p>Since this bitch was applying force onto the sword and was trying to twist it.</p><br/><p>His innards would all snap at this rate.</p><br/><p>Smack!</p><br/><p>\u201cKuuhuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mackill, who poured all her strength onto that attack, screamed out from that single fist of Keron and flew back.</p><br/><p>Since the difference in their runes were tremendous from the beginning.</p><br/><p>But it was clear who gained from that short encounter.</p><br/><p>Keron held down onto the sword embedded in his stomach, grinded his teeth and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou fucking bitch! What have you done! Mana..Why isn\u2019t my mana moving!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Karhal and the other Hunters all freaked out.</p><br/><p>The moment a shout was heard from the dark hole.</p><br/><p>A tremendous shockwave rang throughout and swept past them.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe mana..Why isn\u2019t it working suddenly!\u201d</p><br/><p>They tried to use skills again but then shouted out in confusion.</p><br/><p>The mana that they had plenty of inside their bodies weren\u2019t moving a bit at all.</p><br/><p>Mana.</p><br/><p>A force that was the origin of the adventurer\u2019s power, something which allowed them to use skills.</p><br/><p>The origin of the strength which split the strong and the weak was not moving at all.</p><br/><p>And because of this all their skills and even the reinforcement surrounding their body had been disintegrated.</p><br/><p>Along with the supportive skills on their Artifacts.</p><br/><p>Karhal\u2019s expression froze.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026It seems the girl who went below has done something.\u2019</p><br/><p>Their mana wasn\u2019t activating.</p><br/><p>Their entire bodies were heavy.</p><br/><p>And the skills that had enhanced their senses by numerous times had disappeared.</p><br/><p>The defensive skills that surrounded them had disappeared and made them felt naked and the reinforcement that enhanced their body was nowhere to be seen.</p><br/><p>They all felt like naked children.</p><br/><p>The extremely strange and fearsome sensation caused Karhal to clench his fists tightly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t sure if this effect was temporary or permanent.</p><br/><p>But one thing was clear.</p><br/><p>One, Hansoo standing over there had done something.</p><br/><p>Two, He knew how to solve this since he was the one who had caused this.</p><br/><p>Karhal spoke with a heavy expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cCatch him. You cannot kill him no matter what.\u201d</p><br/><p>If this situation was permanent and only he knew the solution?</p><br/><p>It would become extremely troublesome.</p><br/><p>Humans who couldn\u2019t use skills would fall to the bottom of the food chain.</p><br/><p>Though they had the runes, most of a human\u2019s power came from the skills.</p><br/><p>A human who only had runes wasn\u2019t even strong as a beast with a powerful body.</p><br/><p>At Karhal\u2019s words, Etianon warmed up his body as he walked out.</p><br/><p>\u201cPresumptuous bastard. It seems you\u2019re quite confident in hand to hand combat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Karhal and the other Hunters followed Etianon and stepped out.</p><br/><p>There was a reason why they were approaching Hansoo in confidence.</p><br/><p>\u2018Dumbass. If you\u2019re going to use such a tactic, at least make it so you don\u2019t get hit by it as well.\u2019</p><br/><p>The golden reinforcement that was threatening and oppressive and that had surrounded his body had completely disappeared.</p><br/><p>Which meant that he was also affected by the shockwave from before.</p><br/><p>What did they have to fear then?</p><br/><p>Their runes were at a much higher level.</p><br/><p>And they had many more people.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuccess\u2026Waaa!\u201d</p><br/><p>Akilen, who had climbed out from the hole produly with the small black marble in the hands, freaked out as she saw the people slowly approaching her.</p><br/><p>Since even if the Sealing Jade in her hands was activated, it didn\u2019t make them unable to move.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is bad!\u2019</p><br/><p>When Akilen was about to hurriedly climb out from the hole.</p><br/><p>Hansoo chuckled as he saw her.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust stay in there. Continue to activate that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Push.</p><br/><p>\u201cWaaaaa!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo pushed Akilen back by hitting her hands which was holding onto the wall and then checked the status of his body.</p><br/><p>Kurururk. Kuruk.</p><br/><p>Etianon came all the way up to Hansoo and spoke as he laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? You don\u2019t need any help?\u201d</p><br/><p>Karhal looked at that Etianon with a trusting expression.</p><br/><p>Since Etianon was the best in hand to hand combat despite having weaker skills.</p><br/><p>Of course he would be confident in a situation like this.</p><br/><p>Hansoo laughed at those words and swung his spear.</p><br/><p>Hooooooong!</p><br/><p>The golden spear cut through the air and made loud noises.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026Huh?\u2019</p><br/><p>Etianon, who was about to leisreuly recieve the attack, suddenly froze.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018What the fuck!\u2019</p><br/><p>The moment Etianon raised the dagger in his hands to block it.</p><br/><p>Booooooom!</p><br/><p>The spear smashed onto the blade and made a huge noise.</p><br/><p>Kuududududk</p><br/><p>\u201cUaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>The blade, which had withstood too large of a force, got pushed back onto Etianon.</p><br/><p>A tremendous strength that couldn\u2019t be explained with just runes.</p><br/><p>And because of this, Etianon\u2019s arm which held the dagger got smashed apart as he got sent flying backwards while screaming.</p><br/><p>Karhal and the other Hunter\u2019s expressions froze as they watched this scene.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell have you done\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Karhal mumbled with an expression of disbelief.</p><br/><p>That tremendous amount of strength.</p><br/><p>That was not something that could come out without any skills or reinforcements.</p><br/><p>Hansoo laughed as he looked at them.</p><br/><p>Kudududududk</p><br/><p>The silver liquid constantly flowed inside his body and enhanced his body.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t matter even if there was no mana.</p><br/><p>Since the Dragon Essence Blade and the Body Enhancement Surgery were not a result of mana.</p><br/><p>It was the result of Genetic Engineering that the Akarons, who couldn\u2019t use mana, had created.</p><br/><p>Even if they took the runes into account, the difference between the physical body of him who had been enhanced by the Dragon Essence Blade and the Body Enhancement Surgery and them was more than the difference between a bear and a human.</p><br/><p>\u2018Sealing Jade. Wonderful. Sages, I\u2019ll avenge you guys.\u2019</p><br/><p>He would now ride the rapid currents again.</p><br/><p>Hansoo thought that it was a relief since there wasn\u2019t much time until the Higher Races would come and then stomped on the ground as he jumped up.</p><br/><p>Since he needed to finish this place up first.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s end this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGod fucking damnit\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Maybe this is how it felt when people found out their guns had been broken when they came to hunt a bear.</p><br/><p>No, meeting a bear bare handed would feel better than this.</p><br/><p>Kuduk</p><br/><p>Kudududuk</p><br/><p>The Hunter\u2019s expressions all turned dark as they saw Hansoo who was approaching them while smashing the floor with every step.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Kuuurururururung</p><br/><p>\u2018Hmm?\u2019</p><br/><p>An area that was hundreds of kilometers away from the ceasefire village.</p><br/><p>A wolfman who had been enjoying snacks in the Satellite Fortress of the Arukons,, had his ears perked up.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026I felt a strange aura.\u2019</p><br/><p>Their race\u2019s specialty had developed their sixth sense into supernatural levels.</p><br/><p>And something was touching that exact sixth sense.</p><br/><p>But this much wasn\u2019t enough.</p><br/><p>The 4m tall wolfman and Arukon\u2019s gatherer, Dakidus, shook off his head and then continued to chew the snack he was eating.</p><br/><p>Since it was the most delicious while it was alive.</p><br/><p>\u201cKkuuu\u2026.Aaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>And soon the momentarily quiet rest area in the Attilan got filled up with screams again.</p><br/><p>To be precise, from the screams of the humans who had been prepared as snacks.</p><br/><p>\u201cAaaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>They were all quite powerful adventurers, but they couldn\u2019t even dream of resisting.</p><br/><p>Dakidus ignored the screams and continued to enjoy the snacks, licked the piece of flesh by his mouth and then mumbled.</p><br/><p>\u2018I should find out about this when I go to pick up the harvests this time around.\u2019</p><br/><p>Uuudududk. Kuudududk.</p><br/><p>The giant mouth split open and then swallowed up the remaining bit of the human.</p><br/><p>Dakidus, who had finished the remaining snack, looked towards the ceasefire village which was the location where he would gather the harvest this time around.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

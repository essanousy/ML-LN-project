They\u2019ve already arrived.\u2019</p><br/><p>She hadn\u2019t noticed them because it was so far away, plus the giant city in front of her had taken up her full attention.</p><br/><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we dodge?\u201d</p><br/><p>The concentration of energy from above was not something they could ignore.</p><br/><p>The direction of its attack was headed right for their location.</p><br/><p>Well, it was aiming for the city, but the strength of such sheer firepower could easily sweep them away too.</p><br/><p>Hansoo shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it could get easily swept away from that, it would have long fallen by now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo said leisurely, glancing between Aokan and the fleet above.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>In the distance.</p><br/><p>A massive amount of energy gathered in front of the flagship of the Kalkuroun Fleet.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>&lt; - - - - &gt;</p><br/><p>\u2014a laser beam cut across space and slammed down onto the planet below.</p><br/><p>Although it didn\u2019t release a sound, its speed and aura allowed one to estimate the power behind the attack.</p><br/><p>The meteor-like strike of that beam was slower than the Photon Strike, but there was a vicious technology implemented onto this attack.</p><br/><p>R-Particle Reactive Artillery.</p><br/><p>A weapon filled with the R-Particle that reacted with all surrounding matter to quickly fold space.</p><br/><p>A tactical weapon used to blow apart giant fortresses or the cores of small moons.</p><br/><p>This weapon, which basically created a miniature black hole, turned everything within a 10 km radius into a singularity the moment it exploded.</p><br/><p>But the moment the artillery shell entered the white fog surrounding Aokan, something strange happened.</p><br/><p>\u2026chiiiii\u2026</p><br/><p>The artillery shell quickly lost its momentum.</p><br/><p>The attack, which should\u2019ve turned everything within 10 km of the city into a tiny dot the moment it blew up, quickly fell to the ground.</p><br/><p>R-Koronaita Nell mumbled as he looked at the artillery shell, which had cost as much as the yearly income of a large city, turned into a piece of metal.</p><br/><p>\u201c...It\u2019s well-built. Whoever built it, they did a very good job.\u201d</p><br/><p>The ultimate weapon of electronics\u2014it reacted to anything electronics-related and controlled it.</p><br/><p>Neropa Union\u2019s creation, .</p><br/><p>Resembling a white fog, it covered a range of several dozen kilometers around Aokan and was made up entirely of nanomachines.</p><br/><p>Unauthorized artificial weapons or systems would quickly lose their power and ability to function when they entered the fog.</p><br/><p>\u2018...It really prepared well. Damned brat. What\u2019s really hidden underneath?\u2019</p><br/><p>R-Koronaita Nell gritted his teeth as he looked at the giant city, now completely obscured as the fog thickened.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201c...\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiriel frowned as she noticed that the giant fleet was unable to do anything.</p><br/><p>It felt good to thwart the ones above, but she realized that the city before their eyes was not a simple one at all.</p><br/><p>Kiriel asked Hansoo:</p><br/><p>\u201cAre we going to charge straight in?\u201d</p><br/><p>The giant metal walls of the city made it resemble a massive Pandora\u2019s box.</p><br/><p>A box that hid countless sorrows, but still attracted many with hope.</p><br/><p>To gather crystals, they needed to deal with the Abyssal race inside the walls.</p><br/><p>As well as Melchizedek\u2019s forces.</p><br/><p>Melchizedek knew their strengths.</p><br/><p>And it would have definitely prepared for their arrival.</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiriel nodded at Hansoo\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>In order to attain the power to fight on the upper floors, they needed to raise their level in this place anyway.</p><br/><p>If they could survive this, both she and Hansoo would at least become a step stronger.</p><br/><p>\u2018Enbi Arin\u2026 If she could survive, then it would be a huge help.\u2019</p><br/><p>Kiriel clenched her teeth as she felt her mind calming down at the thought of saving a life.</p><br/><p>She realized what she was truly feeling.</p><br/><p>\u2018...It\u2019s hard.\u2019</p><br/><p>There was no one who could help them.</p><br/><p>The world was large, and there were so many enemies.</p><br/><p>And there were only two of them.</p><br/><p>She\u2019d never truly experienced hardship throughout the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd zones.</p><br/><p>Her abilities were quite good, and the rulers of each of those zones were human.</p><br/><p>The 4th zone was alright as well.</p><br/><p>Although there were many others stronger than herself, she had used her abilities to quickly rise up into a transcendent.</p><br/><p>She had no long-term enemies as well.</p><br/><p>But the moment she met Hansoo, everything changed.</p><br/><p>Of course, she had enemies.</p><br/><p>Except her enemies were spread around, preparing to flip the world upside down.</p><br/><p>She just didn\u2019t know who they were.</p><br/><p>Hansoo and his comrades had been fighting them since a long time ago.</p><br/><p>And they probably still were.</p><br/><p>Melchizedek.</p><br/><p>Clementine.</p><br/><p>Beings that had the thoughts and the abilities to flip the world many times over.</p><br/><p>And as she thought up to this point, Kiriel unconsciously blurted something out.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we keep fighting like this, will there ever come a day when we can smile with true happiness?\u201d</p><br/><p>It sounded like a complaint, but she felt like she needed to hear how Hansoo would answer.</p><br/><p>If there was no light at the end of this tunnel filled with battles.</p><br/><p>This whole fight might lose all meaning.</p><br/><p>\u2018No\u2026 Does the tunnel even end?\u2019</p><br/><p>Enemies after enemies after enemies.</p><br/><p>Go up, enemies.</p><br/><p>Look around, enemies.</p><br/><p>At this rate, she felt like her mind would end up exhausted even before her physical body could.</p><br/><p>Hansoo smiled at Kiriel and asked:</p><br/><p>\u201cHow were the lower floors?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiriel replied instantly:</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, they were much bett\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014Kiriel came to a realization, and Hansoo continued:</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we win, this place will become like that. I hope you liked how they were.\u201d</p><br/><p>And as she heard this\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014Kiriel felt a spring of emotions burst out from inside her chest.</p><br/><p>\u2018...So that\u2019s what they meant. When they told us that it was like hell.\u2019</p><br/><p>She\u2019d deluded herself.</p><br/><p>Things hadn\u2019t gotten hard just because she went up.</p><br/><p>The 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th zones were originally all like this.</p><br/><p>It was only that Hansoo and his old comrades had changed it.</p><br/><p>Hansoo chuckled at Kiriel, mumbling as he thought of his old comrades who\u2019d had to shoulder these kinds of jobs because of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you make bad friends, you will suffer. It\u2019s not too late. There\u2019s nothing really good\u2026 about having a friend like me, you see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked at Enbi Arin with a bitter expression and then gazed upwards.</p><br/><p>\u2018I wonder\u2026 What are you guys doing now? Just wait a bit longer. There are a few things I need to smash apart before I get there.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s bitter expression soon turned ice-cold as he stared at Melchizedek\u2019s metal box.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

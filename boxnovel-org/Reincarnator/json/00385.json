The kids are quickly becoming Transcendents as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because they had no way to efficiently control the Transcendents in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd zones they didn\u2019t make any, but the 4th Zone where Karhal and Ekidu resided was different.</p><br/><p>Even if 1-Star Transcendents appeared, the 2-Star Transcendent Karhal could easily handle them.</p><br/><p>Since he could control them, they just let them loose as well.</p><br/><p>\u2018And\u2026 it doesn\u2019t seem like we have the leisure to hold back from making them.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014 </p><br/><p>Ekidu looked at the lightning surrounding the elevator.</p><br/><p>The space between the zones divided by the elevator twisted from time to time.</p><br/><p>And due to this, it was causing countless bolts of lightning to crash around it.</p><br/><p>A very unstable-looking scene.</p><br/><p>Ekidu asked Hansoo:</p><br/><p>\u201c...How long do we have?\u2019</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t very specific, but it was clear what she was talking about.</p><br/><p>Time until the Abyss collapsed around them.</p><br/><p>Hansoo replied in a heavy voice:</p><br/><p>\u201cNot much. Really.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo looked at the elevator.</p><br/><p>There really wasn\u2019t much time.</p><br/><p>Five months at most.</p><br/><p>Maybe even less.</p><br/><p>He had to unify and organize the seven zones before that.</p><br/><p>Using that as the basis, creating as many Transcendents and preparing for battle.</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked at Ekidu.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want you to take care of this place.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meaning he wanted her to receive the soul fragment and remain here.</p><br/><p>Somebody needed to remain here to enforce the rules and lead the ones coming up after them.</p><br/><p>Ekidu made a helpless expression and replied:</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh. Fine, I guess I\u2019ll be bored for a while. There\u2019s really nobody else here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ekidu shrugged as she looked at the bare plains.</p><br/><p>A colossal creature.</p><br/><p>If Hansoo and Kiriel left, she would be left alone.</p><br/><p>\u2018I want to follow, but\u2026 it seems like that won\u2019t be possible.\u2019</p><br/><p>They had both been 2-Stars up until recently.</p><br/><p>But somehow Kiriel and Hansoo had crossed the wall in that short period of time and had become a step stronger.</p><br/><p>The limits of 3-Star Transcendents.</p><br/><p>If they had both remained below, then they would not have been able to become this strong.</p><br/><p>They became stronger to meet the dangers they came across.</p><br/><p>Ekidu thought of this basic rule of the world and shrugged her shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, I guess I\u2019ll just be lonely and not bored.\u2019</p><br/><p>Ekidu thought as she looked at Hansoo.</p><br/><p>There was a lot to do.</p><br/><p>Even if she received the soul fragment, she needed to rise to the level of a 3-Star Transcendent in order to control and raise the ones coming up from below in an efficient manner.</p><br/><p>Which meant she had to hunt the remaining Abyssal beasts and become stronger.</p><br/><p>And unite the scattered humans in the 5th Zone.</p><br/><p>\u2018What to do about this giant thing\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Guooooooo!</p><br/><p>Ekidu looked at the Nelkipa which had lost its owner, had its crystal broken and was now just aimlessly floating round space. She asked:</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2026 can we not use this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked at the crystal for a moment and shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s\u2026 quite damaged..\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo thought of the streak of light that had destroyed the crystal.</p><br/><p>The Fleet of Flames.</p><br/><p>Their goal seemed to be the same as his.</p><br/><p>Destroying Melchizedek.</p><br/><p>That was probably why they\u2019d helped him.</p><br/><p>But if they really wanted to help, then they could\u2019ve attacked Melchizedek directly.</p><br/><p>Since that would\u2019ve been more efficient and a more sure-fire method than attacking the crystal.</p><br/><p>But there was a reason why they attacked the crystal.</p><br/><p>They had destroyed the main crystal and gotten rid of any possible control of Nelkipa.</p><br/><p>\u2018If not for that\u2026 I would\u2019ve kept Melchizedek alive and tried to use it.\u2019</p><br/><p>Melchizedek probably knew that as well and self-destructed.</p><br/><p>If it could control the Nelkipa, its worth would\u2019ve been much higher.</p><br/><p>But since it could not control the Nelkipa anymore, its existence was basically worthless.</p><br/><p>\u2018There\u2019s still something suspicious.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo thought as he looked at the melted-down crystal.</p><br/><p>That power was not something the Fleet of Flames could make.</p><br/><p>For the crystal that even he, a 3-Star Transcendent, couldn\u2019t destroy with ease.</p><br/><p>They had completely melted that crystal down.</p><br/><p>If that much strength could\u2019ve been gathered in the first place, then melting down Aokan as a whole was possible.</p><br/><p>Or just destroy Melchizedek\u2019s metal castle before it moved to another body.</p><br/><p>But the Fleet of Flames had done so\u2014they had melted the crystal.</p><br/><p>Which meant one thing.</p><br/><p>An outside force had come into play.</p><br/><p>At that moment\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014Hansoo thought of Melchizedek\u2019s enraged roar right before the Nine Dragons Strike had attacked it for the last time.</p><br/><p>Nerpa.</p><br/><p>The owner of the body that Melchizedek ate.</p><br/><p>\u2018...So they interfered, huh?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked towards the direction that the Fleet of Flames had disappeared to and shook his head.</p><br/><p>They would meet soon.</p><br/><p>Since they had to go up now too.</p><br/><p>\u2014kadak\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo gripped onto the marble that the fairy had given him as a present and looked towards Angkara.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh\u2026 Land. It\u2019s really been a long time.\u201d</p><br/><p>As N-Aroel was admiring the giant planet before his eyes, he heard an enraged voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 do you think you\u2019ll be able to live after doing all this?\u201d</p><br/><p>The captain, R-Koronaita Nell, gritted his teeth at N-Aroel.</p><br/><p>There was a limit to how many crazy actions he could tolerate.</p><br/><p>For him to take over the entire fleet\u2026 </p><br/><p>And R-Koronaita Nell had an inkling as well.</p><br/><p>That only their outer appearances were the same and there was something else inside that body.</p><br/><p>Something unlike them.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being confident now, but as soon as we arrive, your body will burn up from the power of the flame.\u201d</p><br/><p>And at those words of R-Koronaita Nell\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u201cKehehehehehe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014N-Aroel smirked as he listened.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou ungrateful vermin. You want to burn your owner with the gift we gave you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>N-Aroel chuckled as he said:</p><br/><p>\u201cJust as I said. The flame you wield\u2026 was originally ours.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014boooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The giant planet of flames, Angkara.</p><br/><p>N-Aroel looked at the red light shooting up from the cracks between the continents in reminiscence.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

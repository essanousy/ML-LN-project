Crunch! Smash!</p><br/><p>Junghwan surprisingly took on the attacks head on and flew towards the three.</p><br/><p>Darlton\u2019s comrades freaked out as they saw this.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t like the guy was abnormally strong.</p><br/><p>The problem was with them.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh!? What the hell! The mana\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The Blue Jades, which were constantly supplying them with mana, weren\u2019t working properly.</p><br/><p>Well, they were being pushed back by the red piece of jade in the man\u2019s hands and couldn\u2019t work.</p><br/><p>The mana which had the power of tens of skills disappeared as the powerful skills heading towards Ekidu turned weak to the point where it looked like a small boy\u2019s fist.</p><br/><p>Well, it wasn\u2019t that the skill itself got weaker.</p><br/><p>It was just that it had returned to its original power after losing the strength of the Blue Jade.</p><br/><p>But as they lost their powerful strength during this important moment, they felt like they had become naked children.</p><br/><p>They panicked and shouted into the necklace.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn! Arukon! Help us please!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cArukon! If you sent us to a place like this then you should take responsibility at least you bitch!\u201d</p><br/><p>They were in such a panic that they even cursed.</p><br/><p>But despite their despair and panic, the Blue Jade merely flickered faintly after being suppressed by the Red Jade.</p><br/><p>Junghwan\u2019s attacks ruthlessly flew towards their necks after they had been caught in place by the numerous suppressive skills.</p><br/><p>And then.</p><br/><p>Crunch!</p><br/><p>\u201cUwaaaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuuhuk\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The bloodied armor Junghwan was wearing turned even bloodier.</p><br/><p>From the blood of Darlton\u2019s three comrades.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026I wondered whose blood it was.\u2019</p><br/><p>Everyone frowned while looking at this man who had appeared so suddenly.</p><br/><p>The light of the Red Jade in the man\u2019s hands pushed back the light of the powerless Blue Jades and filled up the tunnel.</p><br/><p>At the same time everything within the tunnel came into Junghwan\u2019s view.</p><br/><p>The first thing he found was the Harvester\u2019s Crown.</p><br/><p>His expression brightened up as he saw this.</p><br/><p>Since that made the entire search worthwhile.</p><br/><p>\u2018It was real!\u2019</p><br/><p>It was not something that would randomly roll around in a place like this.</p><br/><p>A clear evidence that Dakidus had been killed by someone.</p><br/><p>\u2018Good. Good. Good. Very good. Very very. Good. Good.\u2019</p><br/><p>Junghwan made a content smile as he swept his eyes around.</p><br/><p>The next thing that came into his view were the Hunters standing around in the distance.</p><br/><p>The Dakidus\u2019s Crown was dropped in the middle of them but he knew that those guys weren\u2019t the culprits.</p><br/><p>\u2018What lame fellows.\u2019</p><br/><p>People who solely focused on surviving and filling up their desires.</p><br/><p>They were the same as beasts who searched for their daily foods in Junghwan\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>As he turned his head, the people in front of him came into his view.</p><br/><p>A iron-tower-like man and an extremely beautiful woman who were walking towards him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Those two aren\u2019t bad.\u2019</p><br/><p>But it was clear who had killed Dakidus.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. Good. It seems you were the one who did it. I\u2019m called Kim Junghwan. Nice you meet you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo spat out at Junghwan who was talking to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking? The Arukons won\u2019t stay idle if they find out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Junghwan stopped at Hansoo\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u2018He knows who I am?\u2019</p><br/><p>Those words wouldn\u2019t come out unless he knew that he was allied with the Arukons.</p><br/><p>But Junghwan nodded his head.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well. If he killed Dakidus then there\u2019s a high chance of him finding out a lot of the information. It\u2019s good that I won\u2019t need to explain as much then.\u2019</p><br/><p>Junghwan nodded at the situation that he was liking more and more.</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s words weren\u2019t wrong.</p><br/><p>He had killed the Arukon\u2019s Hunting Dogs.</p><br/><p>It was the same as offending the Arukons themselves.</p><br/><p>But Junghwan just smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is our area. What can that bastard find out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Junghwan hadn\u2019t caused these things without thinking them through first.</p><br/><p>Red Jade.</p><br/><p>The Blue Jade was powerful and had a lot of uses but the Red Jade that could be found within this place had the ability to greatly reduce the strength of that Blue Jade.</p><br/><p>As if it was created to oppose those who used the Blue Jade.</p><br/><p>Of course a few functions of the Blue Jade would get shut off as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine as long as I don\u2019t get found out right? What\u2019s so strange about a few of them dying while facing somebody strong enough to kill Dakidus? Anyways, if you know who we are then I\u2019ll keep things simple. Join us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Junghwan was truly curious.</p><br/><p>\u2018How did he kill Dakidus who was on the Satellite Fortress?\u2019</p><br/><p>For an individual to do a thing that even they couldn\u2019t dream of without the Destruction Jade.</p><br/><p>Junghwan couldn\u2019t even guess as to what method Hansoo had used.</p><br/><p>Though they were keeping the alliance with the Destruction jade, it was clear who had the real power.</p><br/><p>If they go crazy and blow the Destruction Jade then they would be able to kill one of the races easily.</p><br/><p>Since the other two races wouldn\u2019t stay idle.</p><br/><p>But those two races would wipe them out with that chance as well.</p><br/><p>\u2018We need another method in addition to the Destruction Jade.\u2019</p><br/><p>They were basically trapped within the Green Road.</p><br/><p>The three Satellite Fortresses that flew around the skies discreetly kind of helped them as well but they were more focused on watching over them.</p><br/><p>So they wouldn\u2019t run away somewhere and cause trouble.</p><br/><p>But if they had a method of falling the Satellite Fortress without even using the Destruction Jade?</p><br/><p>Junghwan laughed towards Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems you have enmity towards the Arukon\u2026There\u2019s no need to be alone right? Let\u2019s do it together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo had the method and he had strength which he had been gathering for a long time.</p><br/><p>A proposition which would help them both.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t even consider being denied so it wouldn\u2019t really matter if Hansoo said no.</p><br/><p>Since what he needed was Hansoo\u2019s method and not Hansoo himself.</p><br/><p>If Hansoo didn\u2019t reply with a then there would be no reason to stay still.</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>The Hunters who were listening to this all turned white from fear.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is bad.\u2019</p><br/><p>The conversation they heard was short but they could figure out a few things from what they heard</p><br/><p>First. They couldn\u2019t believe it but the strange man who had suddenly appeared was allied with the Arukons.</p><br/><p>Second. A guy like that had suddenly appeared and gave a proposition to Hansoo in order to kill the Arukons together.</p><br/><p>Three. He had killed all the ones with the dog collars of the Arukon.</p><br/><p>The one who had just appeared had basically killed all the witnesses.</p><br/><p>People who had seen and heard this information which couldn\u2019t be found out by the Arukons.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fuck\u2026Run away!\u2019</p><br/><p>Escaping the Maze wasn\u2019t the important part.</p><br/><p>The moment the quicker ones were about to run away.</p><br/><p>The Maze\u2019s wall came down as it blocked the tunnel they came from.</p><br/><p>The Hunters shouted towards the sudden wall which had come down.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Boom! Boom! Boobooom!</p><br/><p>They tried using numerous different skills but none of them worked.</p><br/><p>Though it did dent a little bit as if it was weaker than the door guarding the Triple Fusion Beasts, they wouldn\u2019t be able to break through it easily.</p><br/><p>Since it was thick and hard.</p><br/><p>The Hunters cried out in despair.</p><br/><p>\u201cFucking hell\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Junghwan, who had been staring at the Hunters from the distance, laughed towards them.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are you planning to go?\u2019</p><br/><p>As long as he had the Red Jade, the authority of the Maze would be within his hands.</p><br/><p>Junghwan made an expression of contempt.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damned insects.\u2019</p><br/><p>Despite surviving thanks to the man in front of their eyes, they were trying to run away the moment their lives were in danger again.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t need people like them at all.</p><br/><p>\u2018But wait\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>As Junghwan made a confused expression while looking at a woman within the Hunters.</p><br/><p>Hansoo saw Junghwan bring down the Maze walls and decided.</p><br/><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Junghwan made a confused expression.</p><br/><p>Hansoo laughed as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho said I only wanted to kill the Arukons?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis damned bastard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even before Junghwan could curse out, Hansoo rang along the ground and headed towards Junghan.</p><br/><p>Whoooosh!</p><br/><p>Within the tunnel with 5m in diameter, the 2m-tall Hansoo was pretty small.</p><br/><p>But Junghwan felt like something giant was charging towards him.</p><br/><p>It was beyond his imaginations.</p><br/><p>\u2018For it to be this much\u2026!\u2019</p><br/><p>The reason why Junghwan was confident was because he was sure that he would win if they fought.</p><br/><p>Since he would still be a newcomer from a village no matter what kind of abilities he had.</p><br/><p>And that was why he had anticipated it so much.</p><br/><p>That was why he had hope.</p><br/><p>If it was something that allowed such a weak person to kill Dakidus then it would be much more beneficial to them.</p><br/><p>But Junghwan soon realized his previous thoughts were wrong.</p><br/><p>\u2018What the fuck\u2026.So much! Dakidus should\u2019ve just gotten beaten to death from that!\u2019</p><br/><p>Junghwan hurriedly held onto the Red Jade.</p><br/><p>In an instant.</p><br/><p>Booom! Booom!</p><br/><p>Two walls closed in between Hansoo and Junghwan and separated them.</p><br/><p>The wall that tens of Hunters attacked and hadn\u2019t budged, two of them were here.</p><br/><p>Boooom\u2026..</p><br/><p>Junghwan, who had calmed down after the walls had fallen and he could not see Hansoo anymore, was about to turn around and then made an annoyed expression.</p><br/><p>For him to run away like a scared dog.</p><br/><p>Junghwan was angered by his sorry state and then shouted towards the wall.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou dumb bastard! You fail!\u201d</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t a need for him to act personally.</p><br/><p>Since he would die the moment Akitrus moved in.</p><br/><p>\u2018Stay trapped in there you damned bastard.\u2019</p><br/><p>If the Akion was released then the walls and people will all melt down together.</p><br/><p>The moment Junghwan laughed in a cold manner and was about to leave.</p><br/><p>Boooooom!</p><br/><p>The wall in front of him suddenly made a huge noise and trembled.</p><br/><p>As if something struck it.</p><br/><p>\u2018No way\u2026Did the first wall\u2026?\u2019</p><br/><p>The moment Junghwan flinched.</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>A hand smashed through the wall.</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn!\u2019</p><br/><p>The moment Junghwan hurriedly backed off.</p><br/><p>Grab!</p><br/><p>The hand reached out and took hold of Junghwan\u2019s right arm.</p><br/><p>\u2018No!\u2019</p><br/><p>Junghwan freaked out.</p><br/><p>Only his hand had been caught but alarms of danger rang throughout his entire body and cold beads of sweat rolled down his back.</p><br/><p>His heart was beating intensely as it was warning him of a tremendous danger.</p><br/><p>Junghwan\u2019s skill, , explosively supplied him with mana reinforcements.</p><br/><p>And in an instant a rainbow barrier grew around him and pushed away the hand that was trying to crush his own hand.</p><br/><p>The hand that was holding onto him suddenly blazed up in seven different colors.</p><br/><p>The mana reinforcement around the hand that was holding onto his wrist wasn\u2019t normal and was pushing his back but was not such a weak skill.</p><br/><p>Soon the guy\u2019s hand started to burn from Junghwan\u2019s mana reinforcement.</p><br/><p>But Junghwan soon cursed out.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026This crazy bastard!\u201d</p><br/><p>That hand was rightly grasping onto his hand, as if it was trying to break it, despite being burned.</p><br/><p>Despite a tremendous amount of damage was being caused onto his arm, Hansoo still squeezed his fist in order to smash the wrist.</p><br/><p>No, he was actually pulling him.</p><br/><p>Towards the wall.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuuuuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>Crunch</p><br/><p>He tried his best to stay back but the floor beneath him got dug up as he started to move closer and closer to the wall.</p><br/><p>And Junghwan freaked out as he saw the terrifying eyes that were staring at him through the gap.</p><br/><p>It was clear what would happen if he got dragged back like this.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fuck!\u2019</p><br/><p>Junghwan looked at his right arm while clenching his teeth and then pulled out his dagger with this left hand.</p><br/><p>And then slashed it towards his right hand.</p><br/><p>Chwaaak!</p><br/><p>\u201cUhhhk\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>His right wrist was cut off in that instant and from the rebound force, Junghwan\u2019s body got flung back.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fuck\u2026Fuck!\u2019</p><br/><p>Junghwan flinched again after looking at the hole which had stolen his right arm with blazing eyes of hatred.</p><br/><p>From the eyes full of regret.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn!\u201d</p><br/><p>Junghwan made a terrified expression as he quickly backed off.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damned bastards. I\u2019ll kill you all.\u2019</p><br/><p>Soon Junghwan\u2019s body disappeared into the void.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you broke one door then isn\u2019t it easy to break two?\u201d</p><br/><p>While Karhal was looking at Junghwan who was disappearing into the distance through the hole</p><br/><p>Hansoo shook his head with a slightly tired expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to suddenly blow up all that mana in one go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Skills that allowed one to blow up their mana and achieve a strength numerous times greater than their own.</p><br/><p>This was called berserk mode.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo didn\u2019t really like them because the mana pathways in the entire body got destroyed from these skills.</p><br/><p>He smashed apart the first door and made a hole in the second but breaking through the two entirely was a bit too much.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what will you do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ekidu made a worried expression.</p><br/><p>They would get trapped at this rate.</p><br/><p>Hansoo smiled at those words and then raised his hand.</p><br/><p>The Red Marble that was in Junghwan\u2019s right arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ok. I\u2019ve gotten the thing I needed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Like how Junghwan was targeting his information rather than himself.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t need them either.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019ll be a direct path from here on.\u2019</p><br/><p>This was not something created to just close and open some doors.</p><br/><p>Whoooosh!</p><br/><p>The Dark Cloud came out from Hansoo\u2019s hand and started to eat up the Red Marble.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Rumble</p><br/><p>While Junghwan was running.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>Junghwan was shocked at the wall that had suddenly appeared and stopped.</p><br/><p>\u2018What the hell\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>The tunnels turned and new paths were being created.</p><br/><p>It had never happened before.</p><br/><p>Junghwan looked at the giant structure of the Maze which had started to change with panic.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I\u2019ve guided you here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, he wasn\u2019t just going to leave.</p><br/><p>Since he would die amidst the flaming attacks falling down from the sky.</p><br/><p>Kiriel smiled as she said:</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you saying? Hold your position.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018I knew this would happen. This is why I wanted to hide my trait\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>While Jack cursed in his mind\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014kiiiing\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014the brewing storm amassed and a giant shockwave rang out.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014boooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>A tremendous amount of energy that could bend even space itself started gathering into a sphere.</p><br/><p>A sphere that enveloped Hansoo and Kiriel.</p><br/><p>Zzzzzzzttt!</p><br/><p>The sphere was around 10 meters in width when it first surrounded Hansoo and Kiriel and then it rapidly started to shrink. shrink.</p><br/><p>\u2014swooosh!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Everything within the sphere, even Nelkipa\u2019s skin, started to get sucked into its center.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhhh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Though they had aimed it at the two, its range was so large that it even impacted Jack.</p><br/><p>And while Jack screamed as the force pulled him into the sphere\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014Hansoo frowned for a moment, and then grasped the center of the sphere with both hands.</p><br/><p>\u2014scrrrrrttt!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The gray sphere, which had been devouring everything in its range, let out a huge noise as it froze.</p><br/><p>\u2014kkkkkkkttttt!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The gray sphere tried to devour the two hands holding onto it, but the hands remained unaffected.</p><br/><p>Hansoo pushed around the sphere as he looked at Kiriel.</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed, we won\u2019t need a weapon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShall we smash it apart then?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, let\u2019s just stop it for now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fang in Kiriel\u2019s hands cut across the air, slicing the gray sphere into two.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo threw the hammer in his right hand towards the armored car that had been preparing to run away.</p><br/><p>\u2014zzzztztzzzt!!!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Tendrils of lightning branched out from the point of impact and quickly covered the entire armored car.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t glare at me like that. I\u2019m here to talk.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...Sure. Of course, you are.\u201d</p><br/><p>N-Maria sarcastically replied, glaring at the three people who invaded their armored vehicle.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn, we can\u2019t even run anymore.\u2019</p><br/><p>The opponent was way stronger than expected.</p><br/><p>Even though the weapon on this vehicle was meant for defensive purposes, it didn\u2019t even put a scratch on them.</p><br/><p>\u2018...\u2019</p><br/><p>N-Maria sighed as she looked at the soldier, N-Martin, who was looking down at the ground in embarrassment.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, let\u2019s talk. What do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>Alhough the man had stopped them from leaving, he had controlled his strength from overly damage their vehicle.</p><br/><p>The barrier was still active, which meant that they were still hidden.</p><br/><p>Of course, there weren\u2019t any casualties as well.</p><br/><p>Which meant that this man wasn\u2019t planning on harming them.</p><br/><p>Not yet, at least.</p><br/><p>So a conversation with them wouldn\u2019t be that bad, it was what they had come for anyway.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Still. What a mongrel.\u2019</p><br/><p>While N-Maria frowned at Jack\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014Hansoo shrugged his shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cSimple, I came to ask for help.\u201d</p><br/><p>N-Maria continued to frown and shook her head.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t seem like they\u2019d be very helpful when he was already this strong.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is not an armory. We have no weapons powerful enough to be of use to you. The weapon you just went against? That\u2019s the strongest one we have.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want a weapon. I want a shield.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...Shield?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, please apply the repulsion coating on us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiriel\u2019s expression brightened up.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes, with that\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>The biggest reason they couldn't fight freely was because of those flaming pillars raining down from above.</p><br/><p>A moment\u2019s hesitation or one wrong move could turn her and Hansoo into fried chicken.</p><br/><p>But if they could get the repulsion coating that those cyborgs had, the story would change.</p><br/><p>They would be able to fight freely.</p><br/><p>N-Maria started to think.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Should I?\u2019</p><br/><p>If they did apply it to them, these people would become invulnerable to the Photon Strikes.</p><br/><p>The coating didn\u2019t come off easily either.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t know where this man stood between Angkara and Melchizedek, but they would be gaining extremely powerful shields.</p><br/><p>But she didn\u2019t think about it for too long.</p><br/><p>Maria fell into silence as she stared at Hansoo\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2018...We need to at least survive.\u2019</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t know what his objectives were.</p><br/><p>But she had a hunch.</p><br/><p>That he didn\u2019t have the time or leisure to care about her people\u2019s situation.</p><br/><p>It would be better to apply the coating quickly and then shoo them away.</p><br/><p>Even if she were reprimanded under the laws of the union for giving aid to an alien race, it would be worth it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do it, but you\u2019ll have to wait. It takes a bit of time to prepare the coating.\u201d</p><br/><p>They could prepare it faster if they were at the Main Research Center or the Armory. There was a limit to what they could achieve in an armored vehicle that was built for research purposes.</p><br/><p>After the A-levels started to prep the coating, N-Maria bit her lip as she said:</p><br/><p>\u201cI have one condition.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease do not cause harm to my race while you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t planning to anyway.</p><br/><p>There was no real benefit in fighting them.</p><br/><p>N-Maria\u2019s confidence rose after seeing Hansoo\u2019s reaction, and she added another condition.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, please leave after this.\u201d</p><br/><p>But Hansoo shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo can do.\u201d</p><br/><p>N-Maria started to frown and Hansoo continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust listen, it won\u2019t be that bad for you guys.\u201d</p><br/><p>While N-Maria\u2019s expression turned to one of confusion\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014boooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2018What the\u2026?\u2019</p><br/><p>N-Maria frowned as the entire vehicle shook from the impact.</p><br/><p>One of the B-levels operating the sensors shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve tracked us down!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>N-Maria frowned at the screen.</p><br/><p>Countless robotic foot soldiers.</p><br/><p>\u2018Melchizedek, that lunatic. What the hell are you planning\u2026?\u2019</p><br/><p>N-Maria gritted her teeth as she looked at the half-robot, half-human being standing behind the foot soldiers.</p><br/><p>N-Maria clenched her hands into a fist as she stared at the countless robots who were charging through the flames as if they\u2019d all been applied with the repulsion coating.</p><br/><p>Having once talked to the kind and friendly Melchizedek in the past, she would\u2019ve never expected it to do something like this.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, if he was violent from the beginning then the alliance and betrayal would have never occurred.\u2019</p><br/><p>N-Maria mumbled to herself as she looked at the charging robots shown on the screen.</p><br/><p>Apparently they\u2019d detected their vehicle in the short moment their barrier had collapsed from the previous attack.</p><br/><p>N-Maria glared at the two intruders and gritted her teeth.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve managed to track us down thanks to you guys. At least fight for u\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Even before Maria could complete her sentence, a huge shockwave caused the entire vehicle to shake.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe outer shield has been damaged! They\u2019re rushing us!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit! Defend! Don\u2019t let it break! N-Martin! Activate the weapon!\u201d</p><br/><p>They would be destroyed at this rate.</p><br/><p>N-Maria quickly issued orders as she stared at Melchizedek\u2019s forces.</p><br/><p>But, the Catastrophe wasn\u2019t being activated.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, N-Martin! Activate it immediately!\u201d</p><br/><p>At N-Maria\u2019s shouts, N-Martin, who had been in a daze, woke up from his stupor and began to let out his M-waves.</p><br/><p>All while continuing to steal glances.</p><br/><p>\u2018...\u2019</p><br/><p>N-Martin glared at the two intruders.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

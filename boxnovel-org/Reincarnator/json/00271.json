Stop all this and just follow me. And\u2026 Make everyone under you surrender. Then they\u2019ll at least be able to keep their lives.\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t too late to stop yet.</p><br/><p>Though Tiamet treated the adventurers like crap, he didn\u2019t try to pull them out by their roots.</p><br/><p>He merely kept them below him and controlled them.</p><br/><p>Hansoo replied expressionlessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about the Ains?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jang Oh shrugged at Hansoo\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201c...Nothing we can do about them.\u201d</p><br/><p>The adventurers would just leave this place.</p><br/><p>But the Ains and Mudusella wouldn\u2019t stop trying to get across that mountain range.</p><br/><p>And this was something Tiamet was dreadfully afraid of.</p><br/><p>The Empire and the Kingdoms wouldn\u2019t sit by and watch.</p><br/><p>And even now, there were preparations going on in the Empire.</p><br/><p>\u2018Destruction Cannon.\u2019</p><br/><p>Jang Oh muttered to himself as he thought of the hidden weapon underground back in the Empire\u2019s capital.</p><br/><p>It had been 800 years since the Ains had been trapped.</p><br/><p>They, who had sealed the Ains in fear, always thought of the worst case scenario.</p><br/><p>What would happen when the Ain\u2019s seals were released?</p><br/><p>What would they try to do once they got released?</p><br/><p>And what would happen to the Empire and the Kingdoms because of the Ains.</p><br/><p>The natives had constantly worried and prepared about this for the past 800 years and they had even prepared for a situation where the Ains got to the Spirit Land, a place themselves couldn\u2019t enter with ease.</p><br/><p>The Ains would try to cross the mountain range but would eventually all get killed before they got there.</p><br/><p>Since there was a huge difference between those who had been preparing for 800 years and those who had been in stasis.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust join us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo chuckled at Jang Oh\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>If he took this offer, he would be safe temporarily.</p><br/><p>He would also be able to reduce the deaths by a large amount.</p><br/><p>But that meant that their lives will always be under the control of these guys.</p><br/><p>The reason why the Empire and the Kingdoms could not move out with ease wasn\u2019t because of the War Fortress.</p><br/><p>It was because of the Ains who were slowly gaining back their strength.</p><br/><p>And for Hansoo to betray the Ains, who will become his strongest allies, and kill them all?</p><br/><p>At that point the balance of power will be broken and there would be nothing they could do when Tiamet decides to kill them all off.</p><br/><p>And even so, it was not something he could accept when he needed to receive the Spirit\u2019s powers.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, at least I got to confirm two things.\u2019</p><br/><p>First, Tiamet was very wary of the Ains and the adventurers who could become variables.</p><br/><p>Second, that the variable was across that mountain.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s see what's above it then.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked at Jang Oh after organizing his thoughts.</p><br/><p>Since their opinions and situations varied, they could not avoid a collision.</p><br/><p>And he wasn\u2019t looking to avoid it anyway.</p><br/><p>It was probably the same for Jang Oh as well.</p><br/><p>\u2018Because of our past\u2026 I\u2019ll give you an offer as well.\u2019</p><br/><p>As Jang Oh gave him a final offer because he pitied Hansoo and the others, this was the final thing Hansoo could do for Jang Oh.</p><br/><p>Hansoo steeled himself in order to not show his emotions and then spoke towards Jang Oh in a resolute voice.</p><br/><p>Wanting him to accept.</p><br/><p>Though he wouldn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>\u201cShall I make a better offer?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...What is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo clenched his spear and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuietly hide until this all ends. Don\u2019t interfere. Then after everything ends we will treat you guys well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Keldian had told Hansoo to kill everybody who interferes.</p><br/><p>Along with the Dark Lord of this zone, Jang Oh.</p><br/><p>But there was something Keldian didn\u2019t know.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know how the people below Jang Oh were living their lives.</p><br/><p>\u2018They haven\u2019t done any wrong.\u2019</p><br/><p>Jang Oh had decided to shoulder all their sins.</p><br/><p>But the moment Jang Oh heard Hansoo\u2019s words, his expression froze.</p><br/><p>He could not do such a thing.</p><br/><p>This other guy was probably saying this because he thought that he would win in the end.</p><br/><p>But his thoughts were different after a long period of watching Tiamet\u2019s strength.</p><br/><p>Tiamet would win and this guy would lose.</p><br/><p>So before this guy took all of humanity into oblivion, he needed to kill him.</p><br/><p>\u2018You should\u2019ve stopped here.\u2019</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Boooooooooom!</p><br/><p>Shadows exploded out from Jang Oh\u2019s body and surrounded him.</p><br/><p>Not the cloud-like shadows like the ones he had used so far but rather thick and dark shadows.</p><br/><p>And soon a black knight appeared before Hansoo\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Whooooosh!</p><br/><p>Jang Oh swung across the air with the shield in his right hand.</p><br/><p>Towards Hansoo who seemed to have expected all this and had started to thrust with his spear.</p><br/><p>Boooooooooom!</p><br/><p>The moment the Forked Lightning in Hansoo\u2019s hand collided with the shield, a tremendous explosive sound occurred as a shockwave spread out in all directions.</p><br/><p>Veins popped out from Hansoo\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>An attack which carried all his strength behind it.</p><br/><p>But the shield had successfully blocked his attack.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tsk. I knew this would happen.\u2019</p><br/><p>He was superior in terms of the physical capabilities of his body and in mana.</p><br/><p>But his opponent had many cards to play as well.</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s spear twisted around like a snake then cut across the air towards the black knight.</p><br/><p>The attack which could even smash apart a master player arrived in front of the knight but that\u2019s as far as it went.</p><br/><p>Jang Oh deflected the attack away with his shield then dispersed his body into fragments of shadows.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Whooooosh!</p><br/><p>A dangerous aura from below his feet.</p><br/><p>Hansoo lifted up his feet and dodged away from the shadows that were charging towards him.</p><br/><p>The shadow blades that rose out from the shadows below his feet.</p><br/><p>Boooooooooom!</p><br/><p>Jang Oh, who had been focusing on defense previously, suddenly threw the shield towards Hansoo and Hansoo quickly lifted his spear up in order to block mid-air.</p><br/><p>Though he had lost his balance, he was still superior in terms of strength and mana.</p><br/><p>But then.</p><br/><p>Oooooong!</p><br/><p>Jang Oh\u2019s shield made a strange humming noise as it started to let out yellow light.</p><br/><p>The moment that yellow light passed by Hansoo.</p><br/><p>Shwoooosh!</p><br/><p>The Demonic Dragon\u2019s Reinforcement that surrounded Hansoo\u2019s body and his artifacts got shattered apart and the shield smashed towards Hansoo\u2019s bare body.</p><br/><p>Booom!</p><br/><p>Veins popped out in Hansoo\u2019s arms as he blocked the shield with his spear.</p><br/><p>And as Hansoo jumped back after pushing away the shield.</p><br/><p>Whooosh!</p><br/><p>Hansoo frowned at the chain-like shadows that exploded out from beneath his feet.</p><br/><p>\u2018Dark Spirit. Annoying. That shield too\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Crunch!</p><br/><p>He had ripped apart the chains with brute strength but the shield had succeeded in dodging the spear and smashing into Hansoo\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>Booooooom!</p><br/><p>A tremendous amount of force smashed into Hansoo\u2019s chest and Jang Oh didn\u2019t let a single momemt go to waste as he continued to push Hansoo back.</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>The surrounding flora all got snapped and broken from the shockwaves as the nearby lake melted due to the collision of mana.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo was taking all of these attacks with his bare body.</p><br/><p>Booooom!</p><br/><p>Every time he got hit, cracks appeared on the Thousand Soldiers Armor and the spear got bent to the point of breaking.</p><br/><p>Hansoo smashed the shield which dispersed his mana with the yellow light every time it hit him and jumped back more.</p><br/><p>But Jang Oh didn\u2019t let Hansoo do as he pleased as a storm of shadows rushed in towards Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u2018So this is how it\u2019s like to fight against him.\u2019</p><br/><p>He could not tell where the body, skills and weapons were.</p><br/><p>It was just all darkness.</p><br/><p>He surrounded the entire body with darkness and stormed through.</p><br/><p>Cut the enemy\u2019s vision and attack from the shadows.</p><br/><p>Endlessly.</p><br/><p>Even if he gained the Spirit\u2019s power, he could not do such a thing right now.</p><br/><p>This was the accumulation of endless effort.</p><br/><p>Jang Oh, who had succeeded in integrating his entire body, all of his skills and his artifacts with the shadow was nothing but a mass of darkness.</p><br/><p>A form which did not resemble a human at all.</p><br/><p>\u2018But\u2026 He\u2019s still human.\u2019</p><br/><p>Boooooooom!</p><br/><p>As the yellow light dispersed his mana again and the shadows were about to smash into his body again.</p><br/><p>Hansoo spoke.</p><br/><p>In a cold manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cMichael Dawson. How does it feel to sell out your comrades?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Jang Oh stopped in place.</p><br/><p>Michael Dawson.</p><br/><p>One of the two clan leaders of the Ant Eater clan.</p><br/><p>The name that made Jang Oh regret for all of eternity.</p><br/><p>&lt;If there is a hell\u2026 I\u2019ll be the first one to go there.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Jang Oh\u2026 Your mentality is way too weak.\u2019</p><br/><p>The moment the shadows around Jang Oh\u2019s body trembled.</p><br/><p>Crunch!</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s spear flew towards Jang Oh\u2019s body.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

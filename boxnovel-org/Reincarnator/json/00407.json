He had been looking at the valley and at the light that shone out from its depths.</p><br/><p>Although he didn\u2019t believe in God and all, he still liked to come here from time to time and enjoy the view.</p><br/><p>This was the only place on this planet where a person could witness the deeply hidden Flame in detail.</p><br/><p>That giant sphere that was still visible despite being thousands of kilometers below the surface.</p><br/><p>An agglomeration of a vastly advanced technology that even they, who were already quite advanced, wouldn\u2019t even dare to approach.</p><br/><p>The existence of that Flame was the very reason why he loved this place.</p><br/><p>This Great Valley was one of the few locations that could fuel his greed.</p><br/><p>A location that told him that despite reaching such heights, there were still areas he had yet to conquer.</p><br/><p>\u2018Two in fact.\u2019</p><br/><p>K-Merrow Nell looked towards the far distance.</p><br/><p>Two things he hadn\u2019t conquered.</p><br/><p>One was the Flame under the planet.</p><br/><p>The second was the land of that Pompeion bastard.</p><br/><p>K-Merrow Nell gritted his teeth.</p><br/><p>\u2018In such an important moment\u2026 Why did such a nuisance have to appear out of nowhere?\u2019</p><br/><p>K-Merrow Nell frowned at R-Eronia Nell\u2019s report which told him that he had to deal with this himself.</p><br/><p>But there was nothing he could do.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t have the leisure to care about a fly like that.</p><br/><p>\u2018Pompeion\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>He was strong but so was his opponent.</p><br/><p>Against an opponent like this, he didn\u2019t have the room for leisure.</p><br/><p>He needed to work fast and efficiently while using every card he had.</p><br/><p>Always be prepared for the worst.</p><br/><p>And he had done so up until now.</p><br/><p>Although he might look like a tyrant who\u2019d devoured over half of this continent.</p><br/><p>Although he owned so much to the point of not knowing what to do with anything.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t have a single second to rest.</p><br/><p>While maintaining a good relationship with the other two families, he had to push back Pompeion\u2019s forces.</p><br/><p>This meant that despite having a fly buzzing around back home, he couldn\u2019t do anything about it.</p><br/><p>Since the blade in his hand wasn\u2019t meant for the fly but for something else.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn these annoying aliens\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>But he had to trust in these aliens now.</p><br/><p>K-Merrow Nell frowned as he looked behind him.</p><br/><p>Towards the couple who were sitting down in the interior of the ship.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said you could handle him, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Family matters should be dealt from within the family.\u2019</p><br/><p>K-Merrow Nell looked at the couple.</p><br/><p>In fact, the Dragon God Soldiers he had created were based on these two people.</p><br/><p>Monstrous beings that could rip apart fleets by themselves.</p><br/><p>Even amongst the aliens, these two were part of the elite few.</p><br/><p>\u2018Did they say they were 4-Stars?\u2019</p><br/><p>The woman nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll deal with it. Since your goal is important to us too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...I\u2019ll trust you. Please finish it quickly. But if you can\u2019t even handle this\u2026 I may need to rethink our alliance.\u201d</p><br/><p>K-Merrow Nell spoke these words as he irritably walked off.</p><br/><p>He then added a few more words as he headed towards the terrace outside the ship.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you when the Quantum Transmission is ready. Just enjoy the view from the terrace until then, this isn\u2019t something that just anybody gets to see.\u201d</p><br/><p>And with those words, K-Merrow Nell left the room.</p><br/><p>The couple, who had been left by themselves in the room, watched the videos they received for a while.</p><br/><p>The scene of one man massacring the Dragon God Soldiers while being covered in darkness.</p><br/><p>The man spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly one of us should go, the other should stay and focus on finishing up the plan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...Yes, you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><br/><p>The woman agreed to his words.</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t both go.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t have the leisure to do so.</p><br/><p>\u2018The Great Plan\u2026This is it.\u2019</p><br/><p>The plan which they and the Neropa Union had prepared for.</p><br/><p>Their goal was right before their noses and at least one of them needed to stay here for that.</p><br/><p>The man shrugged his shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u2018One is more than enough.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better if I go, right? Stay here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although they both knew Hansoo\u2026</p><br/><p>But unlike him, the woman had a deeper relationship with Hansoo.</p><br/><p>It would be better for him to go.</p><br/><p>But the woman shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I will go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...Will you be okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>The woman, Mihee, nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019ll deal with it quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mihee looked sadly at the screen.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hansoo\u2026 Why did you come so late\u2026?\u2019</p><br/><p>Too many things had changed.</p><br/><p>Too many things had been trampled on.</p><br/><p>There were too many things on her shoulders now.</p><br/><p>To go back to the days of the Tutorial.</p><br/><p>The days of her, Sangjin, and Hansoo exploring the new world together.</p><br/><p>The man felt worried as he looked at her.</p><br/><p>\u2018Becoming all emotional at such an important stage\u2026 Ugh\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>The man spoke out while looking at her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWha\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStay.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018We might\u2026 not be able to finish this with just words.\u2019</p><br/><p>The man looked at the berserk Hansoo with cold eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble!\u2014</p><br/><p>Dozens of Transcendents had rejoined Hansoo as he ran.</p><br/><p>This included John Stone and the countless others who had spread out to divert the attention of the Dragon God Soldiers.</p><br/><p>But it had been quite a while since they had last met up.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t much point for a diversion since Hansoo\u2019s position had been exposed already.</p><br/><p>And they may get killed off by the Dragon God Soldiers while being away from Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u2014tatatatak!\u2014</p><br/><p>John Stone, who had been running while healing his body, looked confused.</p><br/><p>\u201c...Why aren\u2019t they doing anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo replied:</p><br/><p>\u201cThey realized that they needed a single, powerful strike.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cF***\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As John Stone frowned\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014boom!\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014giant metal spikes abruptly shot up from the ground and into the sky, right in front of him and Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u2014boom!\u2014</p><br/><p>Thousands of metal spikes rose into the air like a giant metal wave.</p><br/><p>Each spike seemed to contain a vicious aura.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit! Dodge it!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a skill that could easily shred apart 3-Star Transcendents.</p><br/><p>Everyone stopped running.</p><br/><p>It looked like the enemy didn\u2019t seem to have any enmity with them since they\u2019d stopped attacking them.</p><br/><p>But John Stone flinched.</p><br/><p>\u2018This skill\u2026.\u2019</p><br/><p>Then\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cI apologize for being a bit blunt, but I\u2019m feeling a bit impatient, you see.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014a man walked out from between the spikes.</p><br/><p>Seeing the man, John Stone spat out one word:</p><br/><p>\u201c...Samuel.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 You\u2019re here as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>John Stone gulped.</p><br/><p>He knew Samuel had departed the Flameless Lands, but for him to have joined the Neropa Union so quickly\u2026</p><br/><p>Samuel made an awkward expression as he looked at the familiar faces among the Transcendents.</p><br/><p>He had never expected to see his old underlings in a place like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must\u2019ve had a greeaaat time after leaving us all alone there, right? You\u2019ve been sticking by their side?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Samuel was about to reply to John Stone\u2019s angry words, but in the end he closed his mouth and turned his head away.</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t come here for this.</p><br/><p>In order to achieve his goals, he had thrown away John Stone and left.</p><br/><p>He had no time to waste right now.</p><br/><p>Especially talking about the old times.</p><br/><p>\u201cKang Hansoo. This is far as you go. Please stop.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo frowned.</p><br/><p>This person had come out of nowhere and had started saying a bunch of nonsense.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease stop going after the Relic. That\u2019s\u2026 something very dear to us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo made an amused expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems that I\u2019ve lost my memories already, I don\u2019t remember us being this friendly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Memory?\u2019</p><br/><p>Samuel paused at hearing Hansoo\u2019s strange words, but then spoke with a heavy expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying, but\u2026 you may not know me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo had always looked forwards.</p><br/><p>And he had chased after him from behind.</p><br/><p>But not anymore.</p><br/><p>While Hansoo was being lazy, he\u2019d run past him and had taken the lead.</p><br/><p>And their plans were about to succeed.</p><br/><p>Samuel breathed in deeply and looked at Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to use the Relic and create a land for ourselves in the 6th Zone.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were so close.</p><br/><p>Their plan of finishing the they were creating with the Neropa Union at the Great Valley.</p><br/><p>And if they succeeded.</p><br/><p>They wouldn\u2019t need to fight anymore.</p><br/><p>They would be able to escape the cycle of fighting and live a peaceful life.</p><br/><p>John Stone roared at Samuel\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastard! You\u2019re basically saying you refuse to climb up! You\u2019re throwing us away!\u201d</p><br/><p>Samuel\u2019s expression turned sad at hearing his shouts.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

You seem to know a bit about me? What are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>His real body was not this physical self but the black clouds floating upon the ground.</p><br/><p>The body would quickly regenerate no matter how much it was attacked as long as no damage was given to the black cloud.</p><br/><p>But she clearly seemed to know about this as she was crazily slashing at the black cloud above the body\u2019s head .</p><br/><p>\u2018Well. Even if she knows it doesn\u2019t matter much anyways.\u2019</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>Just because it was meaningless for his body to be attacked did not mean he could just ignore it.</p><br/><p>The human body which had been enhanced by the Dark Cloud\u2019s real body attacked Elkadion.</p><br/><p>Crack</p><br/><p>Crackle</p><br/><p>The Dragon Essence Blade surrounding Elkadion\u2019s entire body got smashed apart and her ribs also broke.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuuuuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>The 5m tall Taruhol\u2019s body which Elkadion was controlling flung out into the distance after getting hit by the fist of a human who wasn\u2019t even 2m tall.</p><br/><p>The man looked at Elkadion who had been implanted deep into the walls in the corner of the Factory.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you holding on so resolutely? You should know that continuing to resist is futile if you know about me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elkadion spat out and then muttered out loudly after hearing those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up. Someone who\u2019s much more formidable has left. Somebody who can crush the likes of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh, I already saw him fight with you to a standstill.\u201d</p><br/><p>How could somebody who was on similar levels with the one in front of him beat him?</p><br/><p>The choice the man who had ran away made was a wise one.</p><br/><p>Since he would\u2019ve just gotten ripped apart along with this person in front of him if he had stayed.</p><br/><p>The man smirked at Elkadion.</p><br/><p>\u2018But still\u2026 This is a bit troublesome.\u2019</p><br/><p>His strength was continuously decreasing as if the air here wasn\u2019t quite fit for him.</p><br/><p>But he could just fill it back up.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s see\u2026 There\u2019s a lot of food here according to this human\u2019s memories.\u2019</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t a need for his original body to go at all.</p><br/><p>Something popped out from the Dark Cloud\u2019s main body.</p><br/><p>It then went through the ceiling and continued upwards.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well. That should be enough for above. Time to play with this thing in front of me.\u2019</p><br/><p>Somebody who knew about himself who lived in the Abyss.</p><br/><p>Of course it would be fun to play with her.</p><br/><p>The man, who had sent numerous small clouds upwards, controlled the body he took over and started to attack Elkadion.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>Gwanje looked at the in the distance and made a satisfied expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe preparations are going well\u2026 Anyways, finding the portal is really a great boost of morale.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gwanje nodded.</p><br/><p>Since his mind was much more at ease after finding the portal.</p><br/><p>Though he had no thoughts of going up, quite a lot of people were distressed from having no exit path.</p><br/><p>Since the Akadus and the Akarons could attack them at any moment.</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t all stupid.</p><br/><p>They all knew that the current alliance was a very unstable one.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is why\u2026 We need to complete the Suppressive Measure as soon as possible.\u2019</p><br/><p>Actually the Suppressive Measure wasn\u2019t much.</p><br/><p>It was something he had done in the past.</p><br/><p>A large amount of Graphite.</p><br/><p>Them, the Humans, could leave through the portal but the Akarons couldn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>Which meant that this would be used as a threat.</p><br/><p>Though they hadn\u2019t collected that much, it hadn\u2019t been long since the Lazar woke up.</p><br/><p>It would be very effective since it wouldn\u2019t have enough body fluids.</p><br/><p>\u2018Though it\u2019d be better if we didn\u2019t have to use it\u2026. We must take into consideration unexpected circumstances.\u2019</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>Booooom!</p><br/><p>A large explosion was heard in the distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? What happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Are they attacking already?\u2019</p><br/><p>Gwanje freaked out and looked outside.</p><br/><p>Like a child who had been caught in the midst of a mischievous act.</p><br/><p>Gwanje\u2019s expression turned grim after coming out from the simple headquaters and having looked at the territory of the Unity clan.</p><br/><p>Booooom!</p><br/><p>\u201cUaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you crazy? Why the hell are you doing this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Numerous shouts and explosions were heard from all around.</p><br/><p>\u2018Those damned Akarons\u2026Did they strike first?\u2019</p><br/><p>Gwanje ground his teeth as he looked at the Akadus that were assaulting the humans.</p><br/><p>\u2018Oh god. What the hell is this\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Gwanje was flustered as he was shocked again.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026The Akaron\u2019s holy land is also getting attacked.\u2019</p><br/><p>Such a thing wouldn\u2019t happen if the Akarons had betrayed them.</p><br/><p>And looking at it closely, the Akadus didn\u2019t look that normal.</p><br/><p>Gwanje instinctively knew that something was wrong after seeing the Akaron\u2019s territory that was set ablaze.</p><br/><p>At that moment a carrier pigeon flew into Gwanje.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hansoo?\u2019</p><br/><p>He would be able to find something out about this situation if he found Hansoo.</p><br/><p>Gwanje clenched his teeth and then quickly moved towards the location the carrier pigeon came from.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn. What the hell happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gwanje panted as he looked at Hansoo in front of him.</p><br/><p>He had run here in that much of a hurry.</p><br/><p>Leaders of the previously existing clans such as Enbi Arin and Ariel, Oteon and the four Pillars had gathered in front of him.</p><br/><p>One could say that all the representatives of the humans and the Akarons had gathered with this much.</p><br/><p>Hansoo started to explain as people gathered.</p><br/><p>What just happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone from the Dark Cloud race has come here through the Soul Telautograph.\u201d</p><br/><p>A member of the Dark Cloud race.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t care if the target was formless or had form, it would just infect it with the black cloud and control it.</p><br/><p>It would then suck up the energy from the things it had infected and gain strength.</p><br/><p>The Dark Cloud race was a satanic race that even the powerful races of the Abyss avoided.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn\u2026That\u2019s why the Akadus are like that huh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gwanje cursed out as he saw the blackened Akadus on the way over here.</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin was quietly listening to this but suddenly spoke out:</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about humans? Can it not infect humans?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t go for living things since they have a powerful defensive instinct. It hasn\u2019t been long since it came here.\u201d</p><br/><p>But that possibility wasn\u2019t that far off.</p><br/><p>Though it was too weak currently to eat up life forms but once it gains more strength by eating the Akadus at this rate then sooner or later the Akarons and the Humans would get infected by it as well.</p><br/><p>Then it would all end.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need to deal with the main body before that happens.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Are you saying that we need to get through that thing over there?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gwanje looked at the Arklateori that was swarming with the Akadus.</p><br/><p>It was slowly infecting the Akadus one by one without a bit of hurry and was gathering them around the Arklateori.</p><br/><p>Thankfully the collision between the Humans, Akarons and the Akadus had subsided but everybody already knew.</p><br/><p>That if this was to continue then the situation was only going to worsen.</p><br/><p>Arklateori was within its hands already and it would only get stronger by the minute by infecting and draining the energy from the Akadus that came out from it.</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin sighed as she mumbled.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Damn. Why did this happen so suddenly? Where the hell did that thing\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Oten suddenly spoke out with a cold expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is our mistake.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oteon then retold the story.</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin spat out with a dumbfounded expression after hearing the story.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the fuck\u2026 Isn\u2019t Elkadion your leader?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes she is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd we have to clean after the shit she made? With our lives on the line?\u201d</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin spat out curses</p><br/><p>Oteon couldn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>Since the current events were extremely stupid the way she saw it as well.</p><br/><p>Gwanje made a grim expression and then asked Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cHansoo, are you perhaps going to go through that thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded.</p><br/><p>Gwanje\u2019s grim expression turned even worse.</p><br/><p>\u2018If we hadn\u2019t found the portal\u2026 and hadn\u2019t prepared the suppressive method.\u2019</p><br/><p>Gwanje sighed and spoke out.</p><br/><p>About the portal and the suppressive method he had created.</p><br/><p>And added something after the story.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe humans can just run outside the portal. And the final person could just make the Gragos roll with the suppressive measure we prepared.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my, not bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ailen made an impressed expression while hearing it.</p><br/><p>When did he prepare such things?</p><br/><p>Gwanje looked at that Ailen pathetically and then continued to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich means, there won\u2019t be any damage done to the humans even if we don\u2019t partake in this fight. There\u2019s no reason for the ones who come after to die either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded.</p><br/><p>Since those words were very correct.</p><br/><p>But he could not give up like this.</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t come back to run away like this. He had come back to save the people and save the world.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Akarons would all die then, the Body Enhancement Surgery will disappear as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t come here to maintain his condition and be safe.</p><br/><p>He could not give up the legacy of the Orange Zone no matter what.</p><br/><p>Gwanje looked at Hansoo with a much more grim expression.</p><br/><p>And then asked just in case.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do we gain from helping out in this situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really damned.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gwanje sighed out in despair.</p><br/><p>There was no reason to help even if they wanted to.</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t gods, they were merely the old clan leaders.</p><br/><p>How could they lead the people and shove them into that factory over there which was swarming with the Akadus.</p><br/><p>Oteon spoke out with a grim expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. We didn\u2019t call you over here for that. We just called you so we can tell you about all this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will solve it so\u2026 You just watch and escape from here if something goes wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? How are you going to do this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo then took something out from his pockets and held it up.</p><br/><p>One of the greatest techniques that he had taken from the Historan on the way out.</p><br/><p>Oteon looked at that item with a heavy expression.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>A liquid that allowed one to gain the power of a crazy emperor.</p><br/><p>The scent that activated Berserk mode in the past allowed one to gain a huge amount of strength with a harsh side effect.</p><br/><p>This was way beyond that.</p><br/><p>All the silver liquids in the body will start to boil and explode the moment it was used.</p><br/><p>Death could not be avoided.</p><br/><p>A liquid that only the Great Priests could use and no one else.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course this would give a tremendous amount of strength. We\u2019re planning to use this.\u201d</p><br/><p>They would go ahead and break through the Akadus.</p><br/><p>Then Hansoo, who had made numerous preparations to attack the weakness of the Dark Cloud race, would go inside and deal with the real body.</p><br/><p>This was the current plan.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026You\u2019re going this far? You\u2019ll all die.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oteon laughed at Gwanje\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs you said before, this is all the responsibility of leader Elkadion. Something that she cannot shoulder herself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Many had lost their lives already.</p><br/><p>How could Elkadion shoulder all of this by herself.</p><br/><p>Oteon continued to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut it was something our leader did for us. How do we have no responsibility in this matter? We are planning to share her burdens and shoulder them for her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Okay, they\u2019re going for that reason but why the hell are you going?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo chuckled at Ariel\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not working for free. You see Elkadion told me that she\u2019d give me the Dragon Essence Blade but didn\u2019t. I\u2019m going over there to get it back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat crazy nonsense\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As Ariel looked at Hansoo spewing out random words, she made a dumbfounded expression.</p><br/><p>Someone of his level could gain tons of artifacts around that level up above.</p><br/><p>But he was going in there just to keep the Body Enhancement Surgery.</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin and the other clan leaders stared at Hansoo and the Akarons who had turned around after finishing their preparations.</p><br/><p>Well, they were looking at Hansoo\u2019s back to be precise.</p><br/><p>What the hell is inside this guy\u2019s head?</p><br/><p>At first they thought that he was crazy for battles and then they thought that he was hiding something. But they knew now. No, they could feel it now. Every action Hansoo made was for them, the human race. He had his life on the line for them. A tremendous amount of emotions sprang up from inside them.</p><br/><p>\u2018Godamnit!\u2019</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin and the other clan leaders clenched their teeth.</p><br/><p>What the hell were these feelings that were springing up from the depths of their chests while looking at the back of somebody else.</p><br/><p>Why did that guy\u2019s back seem so broad. Why were every single cells they had shaking?</p><br/><p>\u2018No seriously, what the hell are you?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Are you really like the human race\u2019s savior or something?\u2019</p><br/><p>They all muttered the same words.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm. Nothing\u2026 to give us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin stared at Hansoo and the Akarons who were dashing towards the factory in the distance.</p><br/><p>Since he was saying those words that confidently, he would definitely succeed.</p><br/><p>Since they said that they were going to use the Berserk Emperor\u2019s Fluid.</p><br/><p>\u2018They\u2019ll all die for sure. Would only that guy survive then? This just doesn\u2019t quite feel right.\u2019</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t feel this way because of the Akarons.</p><br/><p>It was because of Hansoo.</p><br/><p>That strange guy worked even when there was nothing going for him. He didn\u2019t expect any rewards or compensations either. She didn\u2019t believe this at first but she did now. Since he was showing it clearly.</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin.</p><br/><p>Someone who couldn\u2019t live with debts to repay.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s see. That guy saved my life\u2026Once? Was it twice?\u2019</p><br/><p>Once before she almost got killed by the Tiradus.</p><br/><p>Another one when he had stopped the battle between the Gragos.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, he didn\u2019t just save me.\u2019</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin decided to stop counting.</p><br/><p>Since she wouldn\u2019t be remaining in this current world without Hansoo anyways. As her thoughts got organized she realized that she couldn\u2019t just stand still. She felt like she couldn\u2019t just stand doing nothing.</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin looked at Gwanje and spat out.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you send all the Carrier pigeons?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gwanje nodded.</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin asked Gwanje.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re just going?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gwanje chuckled.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t really feel like I owe my life to him. To be honest he did something he needed to do, he didn\u2019t do those things to save me you see.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin looked at that Gwanje with a confused expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you get armed if you aren\u2019t going to go?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gwanje laughed at those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou see, my wife owes hers to him. That\u2019s the problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gwanje then sent out the final carrier pigeons into the sky.</p><br/><p>They hadn\u2019t realized.</p><br/><p>That Hansoo had slowly started to turn into a pillar supporting them within their minds.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The member of the Dark Cloud race laughed in satisfaction.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s going well.\u2019</p><br/><p>He had read the current situation through the man\u2019s memories.</p><br/><p>The relationship between the Humans and the Akarons wasn\u2019t great and instead they were afraid of each other.</p><br/><p>\u2018Quite lame fellows.\u2019</p><br/><p>How could they win like that when combining their strengths wouldn\u2019t even be enough?</p><br/><p>And it would be even better if the humans tried to run away.</p><br/><p>\u2018I already found the location of the Portal.\u2019</p><br/><p>Dealing with the enemies one by one.</p><br/><p>It was his favorite method.</p><br/><p>If they run away while he\u2019s raising his strength then he could just cut them off in the middle and eat up everyone left behind.</p><br/><p>He could then follow them up and eat the rest of them up.</p><br/><p>The man finished his thoughts and then looked at Elkadion who had turned into rags as he laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you run away? Weren\u2019t your strengths quite similar? It wouldn\u2019t have mattered much if either of you ran away.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man didn\u2019t catch the one running away on purpose.</p><br/><p>Though he could.</p><br/><p>Because he wanted to see the one in front of him fall into despair after realizing that her sacrifice was for nought.</p><br/><p>Since the most amusing thing in the world was crushing the final remaining bit of hope.</p><br/><p>Elkadion laughed and replied to the man\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I have debts to replay\u2026 And Hansoo is the exact opposite. The difference between us is very clear.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>Something was caught within the sights of the Akadus that he was controlling.</p><br/><p>The man confirmed what it was and then frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cGod fucking damnit\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Elkadion muttered inwardly as she looked at that man.</p><br/><p>\u2018You should\u2019ve caught Hansoo no matter what even if you had to ignore me.\u2019</p><br/><p>Since power wasn\u2019t everything.</p><br/><p>The important thing was the magnitude of one\u2019s influence.</p><br/><p>\u2018It seems he really worked hard.\u2019</p><br/><p>Elkadion mumbled as she looked at the flustered man and the huge army that was charging towards them in the distance.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

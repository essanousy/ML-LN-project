He overestimated his own worth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...Couldn't you have taken them all?\u2019</p><br/><p>Not just Tiamet but the 3rd grade citizens as well.</p><br/><p>\u2018Impudent.\u2019</p><br/><p>Akamel frowned at her words.</p><br/><p>He also wanted to show her who was in charge but he could not.</p><br/><p>Unlike Tiamet, MSL-17 was a vital part of the flight.</p><br/><p>\u2018I guess I\u2019ll make another when I arrive\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Akamel was enraged and had almost spurted out his inner thoughts.</p><br/><p>Thoughts that were a bit extreme for the others to hear but were completely fine to utter to these \u2018products\u2019 of theirs.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way. Our worth is much higher than those wasteful bastards. Those things that only know how to waste resources are a plague in a situation where we have limited resources. Maybe you don\u2019t know because you\u2019ve only been alive for a short time, etch that into your memory.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...\u201d</p><br/><p>As Mudusella frowned at Akamel.</p><br/><p>Whooosh.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Akamel held Mudusella\u2019s chin as he coldly whispered.</p><br/><p>\u201cKnow your limits, even if we need you it\u2019ll be a bit hard on us if you cross the line.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, learn to avoid my gaze like that. Now, go ahead and finish your job. Move all the 2nd grade citizens in cryosleep onto the ship.\u201d</p><br/><p>The 2nd grade citizens weren\u2019t used by the Mudusella system unlike the 3rd grades.</p><br/><p>But they couldn\u2019t just throw them away.</p><br/><p>Since they needed them as servants in the new planet.</p><br/><p>So they had frozen close to 10 million of them.</p><br/><p>And they will be moved to the new planet in that state.</p><br/><p>Until the 1st grade citizens finish the preparations.</p><br/><p>The beautiful colony built inside the spaceship was only for the 1st grade citizens.</p><br/><p>\u2018Perfect. I shall give you this planet as a whole\u2026 Farewell then.\u2019</p><br/><p>Akamel looked towards the city in the distance and then smiled as he thought of Tiamet.</p><br/><p>But then.</p><br/><p>[Warning. Warning. The surrounding environment is changing drastically. All citizens move to the designated emergency positions.]</p><br/><p>A sudden warning rang throughout the spaceship.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Akamel freaked out.</p><br/><p>\u201cCheck the outside situation immediately!\u201d</p><br/><p>Akamel hurriedly gave orders to the Mudusella system.</p><br/><p>And soon, Akamel was at a loss at the scene in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo...way\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A humongous tornado was spinning around the Obelisk in the distance.</p><br/><p>As the shield that was protecting the tower broke, a giant tornado had formed inside it.</p><br/><p>Akamel grinded his teeth as he looked at what was happening in the distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the fuck\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Countless ashy clouds that had originally surrounded the entire planet were being sucked into the tower.</p><br/><p>And the mountain range that was barely holding onto its shape was being covered with snow and clouds.</p><br/><p>All the land around the city was freezing and breaking apart.</p><br/><p>Crunch</p><br/><p>Craack.</p><br/><p>And of course the spaceship which was preparing for its flight could not escape this calamity.</p><br/><p>[Calculating\u2026 Flight determined to be impossible.]</p><br/><p>[ASTRO-17\u2026 Shifting to dormant mode.]</p><br/><p>The warning resounded throughout the spaceship as the 1st grade citizens freaked out.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell! What is this! We didn\u2019t foresee this with the Mudusella System!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on!?\u201d</p><br/><p>And the spirit was shocked as well.</p><br/><p>The spirit, which was acting as a generator for the ship inside the flask, made a confused expression as it looked.</p><br/><p>The sky was falling with the tower as the center.</p><br/><p>The Obelisk, which had become the pillar that held up the humanity\u2019s survival was turning everything around it into a land of death.</p><br/><p>As if it was trying to suck in every calamity of the world.</p><br/><p>A similar scene was probably playing out in the other Obelisks as well.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo was also shocked at this scene.</p><br/><p>\u2018..Was this why the ship was resting beyond the range? There\u2019s still too much that doesn\u2019t fit.\u2019</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>Boooooooom!</p><br/><p>Sounds of explosions against the surface of the ship could be heard.</p><br/><p>Even the people inside the engine room could hear it.</p><br/><p>\u201cUwaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop that bastard!\u201d</p><br/><p>Boom.</p><br/><p>Clang.</p><br/><p>Sounds of clashes and explosions were heard.</p><br/><p>Though the spirit\u2019s perception had weakened after it had entered the flask but it could clearly hear those screams.</p><br/><p>And Akamel freaked out with a horrified yelp.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastard...How!\u201d</p><br/><p>It also heard the familiar voice that was responding to Akamel.</p><br/><p>\u201cI sold my soul to the devil.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>As Akamel screamed.</p><br/><p>Hansoo quickly started thinking.</p><br/><p>\u2018He sold his soul to the devil?\u2019</p><br/><p>This current Tiamet was much stronger than before.</p><br/><p>If Akamel had known that Tiamet could make that tower go insane.</p><br/><p>And that he would kill off the other enhanced race to get to him.</p><br/><p>He would\u2019ve never left Tiamet behind.</p><br/><p>And as Hansoo tried to suck in more of the spirit\u2019s memories.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>The spirit\u2019s exhausted voice came into his ears as he started to get sucked out of the flask towards an unknown location.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>When Hansoo\u2019s consciousness came back, it was where he had been before.</p><br/><p>Inside his own consciousness where the spirit had sucked him in.</p><br/><p>And something very faint was barely holding onto its form in front of him.</p><br/><p>Something that had lost its previous seven-colored luster.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat guy?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Hansoo frowned at the spirit\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>The spirit chuckled as he left behind its final words.</p><br/><p>At that moment he realized he needed to hear something.</p><br/><p>\u2018This bastard saw something from my broken memories.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo held onto the spirit as he asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeak, what did you see.\u201d</p><br/><p>As a consequence the spirit became even more transparent.</p><br/><p>As if it was about to flicker off.</p><br/><p>Usually a threat like this would\u2019ve worked.</p><br/><p>Since the spirit\u2019s mentality wasn\u2019t that strong.</p><br/><p>But the situation was different now, it was already done for.</p><br/><p>Whooosh!</p><br/><p>The spirit broke apart and disappeared before it could finish its own words.</p><br/><p>And the seven colored fragments of the spirit\u2019s body entered Hansoo\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>A new ability started to appear in his body.</p><br/><p>Like he was becoming a new entity.</p><br/><p>A change that was occurring as he consumed the spirit\u2019s fragments.</p><br/><p>It was something he wouldn\u2019t resist usually but he was looking around frantically.</p><br/><p>\u2018My memories...Just a bit more.\u2019</p><br/><p>But then.</p><br/><p>Whoooosh!</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s consciousness started to get sucked out.</p><br/><p>Towards the body outside.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Tiamet frowned at Hansoo who had flinched for a bit before moving but then he just gathered more white light in his hands and prepared to attack again.</p><br/><p>It was not something his light spirit had in the past but something he had gained after hearing that he had to devour everything to become a transcendent.</p><br/><p>Boooooom!</p><br/><p>A giant beam exploded out from Rangkom\u2019s Stake as it flew towards Hansoo.</p><br/><p>It was not a might which Hansoo could withstand.</p><br/><p>No matter how close the gap between them had gotten, this beam was more than enough to smash him into bits.</p><br/><p>Booooooom!</p><br/><p>A giant storm of mist appeared around Hansoo.</p><br/><p>Tiamet grinded his teeth as he saw this.</p><br/><p>\u201c...Did you fuse?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chiiiiiiik</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it was like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo replied nonchalantly from inside the mist.</p><br/><p>And the snowstorm was gathering and creating a wall of ice around him.</p><br/><p>As Hansoo lifted his hands to activate this newfound power again.</p><br/><p>Whoooooosh!</p><br/><p>The snowstorm started to gather at a single point.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhuuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>Towards Tiamet who was preparing to attack again.</p><br/><p>And in an instant the snowstorm that had been created from the crazed tower that gnawed away at Tiamet\u2019s power pushed down onto him but numerous times stronger than before.</p><br/><p>The power of the light spirit he had was solely focused on destruction.</p><br/><p>The dark spirit in Jang Oh\u2019s hands was focused on manipulating the darkness efficiently.</p><br/><p>But the ability of the spirit which Mudusella, the manager, had was different.</p><br/><p>Control.</p><br/><p>Control over the power a spirit had.</p><br/><p>An ability needed for her to managel the giant Mudusella system as well as the entire Obelisk.</p><br/><p>Tiamet\u2019s light spirit was more efficient when turning energy into destructive force but not when there was a huge energy storm all around them targeted at him.</p><br/><p>Crunch.</p><br/><p>Crack.</p><br/><p>\u201cFucking\u2026 Hell!\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just any mana storm.</p><br/><p>The mana storm that had previously surrounded the entire planet and had now been compressed by the tower was rushing around Tiamet.</p><br/><p>And as Tiamet grinded his teeth at the tremendous pressure.</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>Hansoo dashed through the snowstorm as he smashed down into Tiamet with the Forked Lightning.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>As Tiamet was flung back and was about to smash onto the ground.</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>Hansoo, who had dashed over and got on top of Tiamet asked as he beat him.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me what happened in the past\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...What?\u201d</p><br/><p>Smack. Smack.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo whispered as he grabbed ahold of TIamet.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you finish them off a thousand years ago?\u201d</p><br/><p>He needed to hear this.</p><br/><p>As to what that \u2018Devil\u2019s\u2019 deal was.</p><br/><p>And if that contract was still in effect.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastard\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Booom!</p><br/><p>\u201cArgh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Crunch.</p><br/><p>\u2018Since the spirit isn\u2019t responding anymore...I\u2019ll need to hear from this side.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo dodged the stake that flew towards him and smashed Tiamet in the face again.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

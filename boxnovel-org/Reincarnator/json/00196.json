There\u2019s no need to be swept up by this as well.\u2019</p><br/><p>The humans were so vicious right now, even they will get tried and fall over if they fight against them.</p><br/><p>But there wasn\u2019t a need to fight.</p><br/><p>They just needed to hold on until the mana came back to this place.</p><br/><p>And Pektoril knew a place that could get him out of this situation and buy him time.</p><br/><p>Since he knew how this place was structured.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is that guy over there as well?\u2019</p><br/><p>Pektoril frowned as he thought of the Arukon\u2019s king, Dakemeia.</p><br/><p>Since he wasn\u2019t showing his face in this chaos, it was likely that he was there already.</p><br/><p>Which means he himself needed to save his forces even more.</p><br/><p>Since he didn\u2019t know what would happen once he got there.</p><br/><p>\u2018Get out.\u2019</p><br/><p>The moment he decided to move.</p><br/><p>Whoooosh!</p><br/><p>Pektoril shook the golden spear he was holding and swung it around.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuuuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though they were both high races, the Akalachias were dimensions apart from the Rebeloongs.</p><br/><p>The humans who were in the trajectory of the golden spear got swept away.</p><br/><p>At the same time the golden feathers on Pektoril\u2019s body trembled.</p><br/><p>Chrrrrrrng!</p><br/><p>As Pektoril\u2019s feathers rang out and the Akalachias who were fighting nearby with their golden spears heard this, they all flinched.</p><br/><p>The special communication method of Akalachias.</p><br/><p>And the meaning behind it was clear.</p><br/><p>Retreat.</p><br/><p>The expressions of the Akalachias stiffened up but a sound of confirmation rang throughout.</p><br/><p>Soon.</p><br/><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><br/><p>Pektoril judged that everyone understood his intentions as he covered his entire body tightly with the feathers and started to run towards a certain location within the Birdcage.</p><br/><p>And countless Akalachias started to charge through the humans and followed behind Pektoril.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck! Stop them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow the hell do we do that?! Ugh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>Crunch!</p><br/><p>A few of them tried to stop the Akalachias but the 10m tall beasts were much larger than the 4m tall Rebeloongs.</p><br/><p>Like foxes being kicked away by an elephant, the Akalachias kicked away the humans and started to follow Pektoril towards an unknown destination.</p><br/><p>And the humans pondered for a moment and then started to focus on the remaining Rebeloongs.</p><br/><p>Since there was no need to increase the amount of their opponents when dealing with the Rebeloongs was hard enough.</p><br/><p>Well, instead of the Akalachias who weren\u2019t really concerned with playing around with them usually, the Rebeloongs who enjoyed killing and playing with them made their rage boiled much more.</p><br/><p>\u201cDie! Fucking bastards!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUaaaaa\u201d</p><br/><p>The humans charged towards the Rebeloongs like swarms of ants.</p><br/><p>The Rebeloongs tried to retaliate but they had already lost their leader and their momentum had been smashed apart already.</p><br/><p>The manaless Rebeloongs who had been injured from the fight against the Akalachias started to get buried under the humans one by one and died off.</p><br/><p>And Kallum shouted out in despair and rage after watching this scene.</p><br/><p>\u201cPektooorrrriiiill! Akalachia! You damned bastard!\u201d</p><br/><p>He was not someone who should be dying here.</p><br/><p>There were hundreds of thousands of his comrades on the outside.</p><br/><p>And he belonged in the top echelon of his entire race.</p><br/><p>Kallum\u2019s rage filled shout rang towards the Akalachias and Pektoril.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou will guys will also\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>But Kallum couldn\u2019t finish his words.</p><br/><p>Paaagagagak</p><br/><p>Since Hansoo\u2019s right hand charged in and crunched Kallum\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>\u201cUaaghh\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Kallum slowly died.</p><br/><p>Paaduududuk.</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked towards Pektoril who had started running away.</p><br/><p>\u2018He\u2019s leaving huh.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked around.</p><br/><p>The people were fighting well.</p><br/><p>Like an ember falling in a gunpowder storage.</p><br/><p>Even if he disappeared these guys would able to win against the Rebeloongs easily.</p><br/><p>Since he had already killed everyone who had the power to lead them anyway.</p><br/><p>The one whom he had just killed was the last.</p><br/><p>The Rebeloongs couldn\u2019t group up after losing their leaders as they were being swept away all over the battlefield.</p><br/><p>Since this place had almost ended, it was now time for him to do his job.</p><br/><p>Whooosh</p><br/><p>Hansoo jumped up into the skies and followed Pektoril who was running away in the distance.</p><br/><p>Towards his guide.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Booooom!</p><br/><p>Pektoril stood in front of a giant structure after arriving at the corner of the Birdcage.</p><br/><p>And the Akalachias looked at Pektoril with confused expressions.</p><br/><p>\u201cO Pektoril. Why have we come here\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Though they had followed his lead, the place they had arrived was too weird.</p><br/><p>This place was where they put their trash.</p><br/><p>An awful odor radiated from the giant structure in front of their eyes and there were mountains of rubbish and garbage piled up around.</p><br/><p>This was a place where they threw away the trash and the corpses of the bugs that were created from the Birdcage.</p><br/><p>Even the bugs hated coming to this place so the ones who had the worst achievements in the Birdcage were specifically sent to this place.</p><br/><p>Of course the Higher Races hated coming near this place as well.</p><br/><p>It was obvious.</p><br/><p>Since it was disgusting.</p><br/><p>So much that the punishment for scoring the least in the war game was patrolling this place for a week.</p><br/><p>As the Akalachias frowned with the location that everyone in the Birdcage hated visiting in front of their eyes.</p><br/><p>Booom! Boom!</p><br/><p>Pektoril ignored the trash dirtying his spear and golden feathers as he started to dig towards the center of this giant place.</p><br/><p>And the Akalachias freaked out as they saw this.</p><br/><p>\u201cO Pektoril! What are\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOur feathers and spears are getting dirty!\u201d</p><br/><p>Maybe it was because they were birds originally but they cared extremely about keeping their feathers clean.</p><br/><p>Since their beautiful golden feathers were like their pride.</p><br/><p>Of course they cared deeply for their feathers and kept their weapons and armors clean as well.</p><br/><p>And this was why they hated to kill humans.</p><br/><p>Since they didn\u2019t like their blood and flesh dirtying them.</p><br/><p>But Pektoril, who usually reminded them to keep their majesticness, was digging into the trashfield.</p><br/><p>And Pektoril shouted towards them as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys hurry up and clean as well! We don\u2019t have much time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone frowned at these words.</p><br/><p>But these were the words of their leader Pektoril.</p><br/><p>The Akalachias swung their spears and swords as they started to dig apart the mountain of trash in front of them.</p><br/><p>Booom! Booooom!</p><br/><p>The mountain of trash was giant but the ones moving the mountain away were 10m tall giants as well.</p><br/><p>Everytime the spears and swords swung part the garbage blew apart like bombs in all directions.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhuk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course they got dirty in the process.</p><br/><p>The Akalachias freaked out as they saw their spears and feathers having dirtied by the garbage and other waste.</p><br/><p>Pektoril shook his head as he watched these guys who were making extremely discontent expressions.</p><br/><p>\u2018They\u2019re still brats.\u2019</p><br/><p>They were big but their attitudes were screwed up.</p><br/><p>For them to only chased around shiny and beautiful things.</p><br/><p>Being majestic was important but in order to win in a fight one needed to become more evil and dirtier than your opponents.</p><br/><p>This was the reason why they, the Akalachias, could not beat the other two races despite being the strongest.</p><br/><p>Disliking being dirty like the Rebeloongs or vicious like the Arukons was enough to stop them for a moment in the battlefield and this alone could determine death.</p><br/><p>But Pektoril only frowned and didn\u2019t speak out.</p><br/><p>\u2018Whatever. There isn\u2019t a battlefield like that\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Booom!</p><br/><p>Booooooom!</p><br/><p>Pektoril sighed as he started to dig out the entrance.</p><br/><p>A short moment later.</p><br/><p>Tonggg!</p><br/><p>Pektoril\u2019s spear made a tong sound as it bounced off.</p><br/><p>And the Akalachias were shocked as they saw this.</p><br/><p>There was an object in this mountain of trash that could make the spear of Pektoril bounce off?</p><br/><p>An object that strong wouldn\u2019t even be sent here in the first place.</p><br/><p>They would just recycle it.</p><br/><p>As the Akalachias made a confused expression.</p><br/><p>\u2018Found it.\u2019</p><br/><p>Kuuudududuk</p><br/><p>Kududuk</p><br/><p>Pektoril used his body and spear to clean around the area.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fuck. I\u2019m starting to get annoyed.\u2019</p><br/><p>Pektoril suddenly vibrated his feathers as he shouted out.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you guys going to stand still?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026Understood!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Akalachias hurriedly ran over and started to clean away the trash.</p><br/><p>While frowning.</p><br/><p>And soon.</p><br/><p>Kooouuuung</p><br/><p>A giant tombstone appeared before their eyes.</p><br/><p>Pektoril stared at the 10m tall tombstone which was made of an unknown metal and then started to push it.</p><br/><p>Rumble</p><br/><p>It was so heavy that Pektoril\u2019s might, which could even smash apart the barrier of the Satellite Fortress with just a swing of his spear, could barely make it move.</p><br/><p>The Akalachias watching from the side joined in and then the tombstone finally started to move a bit faster.</p><br/><p>Rumble</p><br/><p>And then.</p><br/><p>The tombstone was moved and a giant circular tunnel appeared below.</p><br/><p>The Akalachias made confused expressions while looking at the dark tunnel.</p><br/><p>\u201cO Pektoril. This\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>They had heard many stories but they had never heard about this.</p><br/><p>Pektoril frowned from those words but then willed himself as he spoke out.</p><br/><p>He was going to just sit around here until the mana came back but since this had all happened, telling these guys wouldn\u2019t hurt.</p><br/><p>About the history that him and the other 1st Generation members had decided to hide.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing bad about you guys hearing this. Come in first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pektoril finished speaking and he jumped down.</p><br/><p>Whoooosh.</p><br/><p>The Akalachias thought for a moment but then followed him as they jumped down.</p><br/><p>Whoosh!</p><br/><p>Whooooosh!</p><br/><p>After the dark tunnel swallowed up tens of Akalachias.</p><br/><p>Rumble</p><br/><p>As if the giant tombstone was rewinding itself, it started to move back to its original position.</p><br/><p>And as the tombstone was about to block the tunnel completely.</p><br/><p>Whooooosh</p><br/><p>A 2m tall black humanoid shaped thing jumped into the tunnel with a golden spear.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>A tremendous vibration rang out as the giant tombstone blocked the entrance again and the trash mountains started to tremble from the vibration.</p><br/><p>Rumble!</p><br/><p>Soon.</p><br/><p>The tombstone was buried under the avalanche of trash and garbage again and only the filth remained behind as if nothing had happened here.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>Rumble.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my\u2026 It seems somebody is coming in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Metiron frowned as he sensed the secret area rumbling.</p><br/><p>He had expected it but it was too early.</p><br/><p>He needed to finish the job here before they got here.</p><br/><p>\u2018Anyways\u2026 How did Clementine even find out about this place?\u2019</p><br/><p>A circular door with a diameter of 500m.</p><br/><p>Metiron entered the secret area of the secret area and then exclaimed out as he saw hundreds of thousands of glass containers in front of him.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

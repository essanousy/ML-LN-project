Let\u2019s first hear the story.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tekilon froze his expression and moved his body towards the Flower where he had been denied access before.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>Charururuk</p><br/><p>The Flower, which didn\u2019t seem like it would let anyone through, melted down.</p><br/><p>As the giant energy walls disappeared, a beautiful palace came into view.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>The palace of the Elvenheims.</p><br/><p>The palace which didn\u2019t emit a single noise was extremely clean due to the petals that didn\u2019t even let a speck of dust through but it was still very barren to Tekilon who knew the palace of the olden days when it was filled with flowers and music.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well that\u2019s not the important part.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tekilon went past the corridor and the giant pillars and then approached the throne where the other version of him was.</p><br/><p>A giant chair which had a giant spear leaned against it.</p><br/><p>Tekilon frowned as he looked at the existence that looked exactly the same as him sitting on the Throne.</p><br/><p>An existence that was looking at him with an extremely tired expression.</p><br/><p>The original body spoke towards the clone.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026It seems like the Devouring and Vomiting Root was extremely anxious.\u201d</p><br/><p>The original body had long understood the situation.</p><br/><p>Calamity Fish, Devouring and Vomiting Root and even the Ouroboros.</p><br/><p>\u2018And\u2026 That child has died too.\u2019</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know who but it seemed amazing people had come into this world.</p><br/><p>Tekilon looked at the original body as if that guy was a traitor and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you stop the plan mid way? Did you fail at connecting the dimensional portal?\u201d</p><br/><p>No, their plan was simple.</p><br/><p>First, get the World Tree which protected the Elvenheims into a mess.</p><br/><p>Then kill off or exile all the Elvenheims to monopolize the power of the World Tree.</p><br/><p>Borrow the yet-to-die World Tree\u2019s power and create a dimensional portal towards their world.</p><br/><p>Call their dying race from the fallen world, get rid of the Calamities while the World Tree was still dying, revive the World Tree and then make their race bloom again.</p><br/><p>It seemed like the Elvenheims were dead or exiled and the World Tree was dying but looked like it was still working.</p><br/><p>But then where did their race go and why were randoms roaming around the World Tree?</p><br/><p>The original body made a depressed expression at those words.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I opened the dimensional Portal. You\u2019ve seen it too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tekilon freaked out.</p><br/><p>He did indeed see it.</p><br/><p>Since he was able to feel it while he was controlling the Ouroboros.</p><br/><p>Through it stopped working now but there indeed was a dimensional portal way below the World Tree.</p><br/><p>Was that connected to their world?</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The original body looked at Tekilon with a tired expression.</p><br/><p>That was another him.</p><br/><p>Him of the past when he had thoughts full of saving his race and was full of vigor.</p><br/><p>That was why that guy didn\u2019t know yet.</p><br/><p>Why he had failed.</p><br/><p>And to why he had given up everything and decided to sleep inside the Flower instead.</p><br/><p>The answer was extremely simple.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur race cannot come over here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>The goal he had achieved by killing countless Elvenheims who believed and followed him had failed.</p><br/><p>SInce that dimensional door could only send people towards that location and not bring them to this side.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Why not!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tekilon muttered with a blank expression.</p><br/><p>Wouldn\u2019t he have looked into it?</p><br/><p>Logically, the Dimensional Door was capable of bidirectional travel.</p><br/><p>But why was it only one way?</p><br/><p>The original body mumbled while looking at himself of the past.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe density of the energy changed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Originally, their world and this world should have the same energy density.</p><br/><p>But as to whatever happened, when he opened the Dimensional Door the energy of their world that was on the other side had been raised a level.</p><br/><p>As if somebody had changed it to set the world up like a staircase.</p><br/><p>So those from this world could go over to that side.</p><br/><p>But the ones on the other side could not come over here.</p><br/><p>Even if they do, they\u2019ll die very quickly.</p><br/><p>Like a fish dying once it comes out of the water.</p><br/><p>Tekilon made a devastated expression after hearing the whole story.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what happened\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He had feelings too.</p><br/><p>He had met countless Elvenheims while he lived with them, he made friends and even family.</p><br/><p>He had thought of giving up countless times while creating the Calamities in secret and continuing with the plan.</p><br/><p>And because of this he had taken almost a year after he had created all four Calamities and finished his preparations in order to think and find a different method.</p><br/><p>To find out if there was a way for the two race to live in harmony.</p><br/><p>Despite knowing that his dying clan was suffering in the world across.</p><br/><p>While he was pondering and pondering, the child he had gained over at this side had died.</p><br/><p>At that moment the King, Tekilon, felt something snapping inside his head.</p><br/><p>He had tried madly in order to save his son.</p><br/><p>But something had gone wrong and the attempt of saving his son had instead just created a seed for another Calamity.</p><br/><p>Tekilon then realized that it was time for him make a decision.</p><br/><p>Either have all his plans exposed and return to nothing because of the existence that used to once be his son that was going crazy.</p><br/><p>Or to rush his plan that he had been pushing back in order to accomplish his goals.</p><br/><p>As if something was pushing him, the moment of choice had come to him.</p><br/><p>And after a long period of thought, he chose the second option.</p><br/><p>Since the moment his son died, he thought of the other son which he had left behind in the other world.</p><br/><p>\u201cGoddammit\u2026 Godammit\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a plan which he had executed in such a desperate time.</p><br/><p>While wiping off the race he had spent hundreds of years with.</p><br/><p>Though it wasn\u2019t a complete extinction because there were many of them who had escaped out of this Dimension but it was basically the same as destroying an entire race.</p><br/><p>But to not have succeeded after that.</p><br/><p>The devastated Tekilon suddenly made a cold expression.</p><br/><p>He knew after hearing the words of the old Tekilon.</p><br/><p>The energy of the dimension changed as if somebody played around with it.</p><br/><p>And while the old Tekilon gave up and was sleeping a strange race had taken residence below.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is there really no connection between these two?\u2019</p><br/><p>The young Tekilon glanced below the World Tree and then muttered.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to clean up everything below. You help me. You should understand me since you are me. I will try to open the Dimensional Portal again after sweeping up the guys below.\u201d</p><br/><p>He could do it.</p><br/><p>There was nothing on his mind that could stop him.</p><br/><p>Which meant that there was no reason to.</p><br/><p>Since he had nothing to lose even if his decision was wrong.</p><br/><p>No, he had to do this even if there was a 1% chance of his decision being correct.</p><br/><p>The Old Tekilon made a bitter smile while looking at the young Tekilon.</p><br/><p>There was too much of a time difference even if they were the same person.</p><br/><p>He was exhausted.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t have the strength or the will to cause such a mass murder.</p><br/><p>And he had a feeling.</p><br/><p>That it wouldn\u2019t work even if they did that.</p><br/><p>The race below had no connection to this problem.</p><br/><p>\u2018But\u2026 He wouldn\u2019t listen.\u2019</p><br/><p>My young self.</p><br/><p>He was different from the his old self who was exhausted and was about to die from loneliness.</p><br/><p>He was full of vigor, his love for his race was stronger and he was also being affected from the loss of his son more.</p><br/><p>And because of this he could create a mass murder without any hesitation even with just a slight possibility of saving his race.</p><br/><p>The past Tekilon knew how the Old Tekilon felt because they were the same.</p><br/><p>He knew that there was no point of trying to stop him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to help you. But I will respect your choice.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then the old Tekilon lifted up the giant spear next to the throne.</p><br/><p>King\u2019s two treasures.</p><br/><p>The two treasures that were required to keep the kingship.</p><br/><p>One was the armor that protected the King, Thousand Soldiers Armor.</p><br/><p>And another one.</p><br/><p>A spear of punishment that allowed the King to kill anybody who has gone against the king whoever they were.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kudududk</p><br/><p>The young Tekilon, who had received the King\u2019s Spear , looked down the World Tree with a renewed resolution.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>The World Tree was squirming as it was moving them upwards.</p><br/><p>As if it was rapidly teleporting them over short distances.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo, who had been heading up, thought of the Flower and the Wasp Legion at the end of the path.</p><br/><p>\u2018I can almost see the end.\u2019</p><br/><p>Kill the Calamity Fish, revive the Roots and create land to live on.</p><br/><p>Kill the Devouring and Vomiting Root, take the Plant and then take back the Toxic Waters that will go into the World Tree.</p><br/><p>Kill the Ouroboros to retake the Pillar, which worked as the purifying pump.</p><br/><p>Kill the Wasp Legion in order to revive the World Tree\u2019s branches and leaves that these things constantly gnawed upon.</p><br/><p>Kill the Calamities that were eating up the World Tree and create some room for the World Tree to revive.</p><br/><p>At this stage take all the Relics and Divine Stone Fragments to the Core within the Flower above the World Tree\u2019s Pillar, Branches, and leaves to return the Divine Stone Fragments to their original location.</p><br/><p>Once he created some space for the World Tree to revive and supply it with the Divine Stone then the World Tree will come back to life.</p><br/><p>Then he will be able to save most of the 3 billion people who would come after.</p><br/><p>No, he would be able to use the fruits of the World Tree in order to multiply those numbers at an extreme speed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Create a new Earth in this place.\u2019</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t lack any food, could teleport anywhere and were supplied with plenty of energy.</p><br/><p>The population would be able to multiply at an astronomical pace.</p><br/><p>But that wasn\u2019t enough.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t come here in order to create a peaceful world.</p><br/><p>Use the relics to create a new .</p><br/><p>The new king of the Red zone.</p><br/><p>An almighty authority that would have the power to control everyone within their hands with the Relics and all of the World Tree\u2019s Power with their basis no matter if the people who would come after reach the numbers of a billion, two or even three billion.</p><br/><p>An existence that would be able to force those people into the battlefield and create them into soldiers without their consent.</p><br/><p>Then his first plan, , will be completed.</p><br/><p>The first stage which was to create an end result of billions of soldiers.</p><br/><p>He will then be able to go up after leaving everything onto the King with ease.</p><br/><p>\u2018Who should I make the King?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo mumbled as he looked at the people next to him.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t bring Sangjin.</p><br/><p>Since the Punisher needed to look like they had no relations to him.</p><br/><p>The people he had brought were four of the six.</p><br/><p>Baek Jongsang.</p><br/><p>Arc Mariangt.</p><br/><p>Kyle Cooper.</p><br/><p>The three who had stayed here the longest after Miyamoto and were the strongest out of the Seven Departed Souls because of that.</p><br/><p>And Sof\u00eda Vergara.</p><br/><p>Sof\u00eda was the weakest since she was the youngest but her trait, , was extremely formidable.</p><br/><p>\u2018And it\u2019s actually very helpful.\u2019</p><br/><p>Sof\u00eda was endlessly pointing left and right while shouting out.</p><br/><p>\u201cThree from the left! Two from the Right!\u201d</p><br/><p>The mutated Wasps were popping out in the Vassal\u2019s Tunnel endlessly while they were heading up.</p><br/><p>\u201cGoddamit! These guys are really strong!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jongsang shouted while grinding his teeth.</p><br/><p>They were so sneaky that they weren\u2019t even getting caught in their senses properly.</p><br/><p>If they didn\u2019t have Sof\u00eda\u2019s trait then they would\u2019ve gotten hurt from a sneak attack already.</p><br/><p>\u2018But\u2026 We can go up if it\u2019s just this much.\u2019</p><br/><p>While they were making slightly comfortable expressions, Sof\u00eda\u2019s expression quickly turned solemn.</p><br/><p>Something was heading towards them from very far away.</p><br/><p>While pouring out a fierce aura in all directions as if it didn\u2019t have any thoughts of hiding it.</p><br/><p>\u2018Oh my god. What is this.\u2019</p><br/><p>Boom! Booboom! Bobobooom!</p><br/><p>An extremely thick and hard thing that was approaching them at extreme speed while breaking through the Pillar of the World Tree that had withstood the thrashing of the Ouroboros.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo was standing at the end of that path.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamnit! Dodge\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>Even before she could finish her words, a giant golden spear, which came through into the Vassal\u2019s Tunnel, accurately smashed into Hansoo.</p><br/><p>Hansoo tried to dodge it but the golden spear showed a turn which was impossible for its speed as it smashed into Hansoo\u2019s chest like a homing missile.</p><br/><p>Kududuk</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo, who had barely stopped the spear that tried to penetrate his chest, couldn\u2019t handle the force as he broke through the Vassal\u2019s Tunnel and flew outside along with the spear.</p><br/><p>Proofreader\u2019s note</p><br/><p>This is a sponsored chapter.</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s master plan is revealed!</p><br/><p>It seems Akuma was the dead child of the elf king\u2019s, that he tried to save but that went extremely wrong. Then he was going to get exposed because of Akuma, so he had to proceed with his plans immediately or give them up completely and lose his kingship anyway.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

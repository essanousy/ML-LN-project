Your strength seems to be increasing? Why are you so angry?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Tainted Emotion increased the strength and dexterity of her attacks, but Ares continued laughing leisurely as he blocked her attacks with his dual blades.</p><br/><p>\u2014toong!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014tonk!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Attacks that arced strangely to block her own blows and even drew close to a fatal strike.</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin bit her lip\u2014his attacks were aiming for her vital points.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn\u2026 it seems that I looked down on him way too much. Maybe I\u2019ve rested a bit too long.\u2019</p><br/><p>Their levels of strength had been similar in the past.</p><br/><p>But while she had been captured and was asleep because of Melchizedek, Ares had continuously improved himself with every day.</p><br/><p>The fact that he was trying to capture her alive revealed the difference between their strengths.</p><br/><p>No matter how much he liked her, if there weren\u2019t this big of a gap, then he would have never thought of doing such a thing.</p><br/><p>\u2014boooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u201cWoah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ares leaned back to dodge her fist, an attack that was further enhanced by the Dragon God Armor, and then he backed off with a surprised expression.</p><br/><p>While keeping his distance with the long sword on his right arm, and defending attacks flying towards him with the short sword on his left, Ares slowly backed off and smiled.</p><br/><p>\u2018I love it.\u2019</p><br/><p>With this much difference in strength and knowing that he liked her, she could easily use his emotions to her advantage.</p><br/><p>Like ignoring her own life and defenses and only focusing on attacks.</p><br/><p>Ares would\u2019ve been in a difficult position if that happened.</p><br/><p>If the girl he liked acted in that way, then it would hurt him quite a bit.</p><br/><p>Ares Valentine didn\u2019t hold back from saying his thoughts out loud:</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you putting your life on the line? You might be able to give me a harder time if you did that. How can I attack such a pretty lady?\u201d</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin scoffed as she replied:</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re funny. A snake like you, would you really be able to do that?\u201d</p><br/><p>The smile on Ares Valentine\u2019s face deepened as he heard Enbi Arin\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ah\u2026 I love it. Enbi Arin. I really, really do like you.\u2019</p><br/><p>The reason why he liked Enbi Arin wasn\u2019t because he had a certain degree of pride that refused to accept defeat.</p><br/><p>It was because she knew the answer.</p><br/><p>She was smart.</p><br/><p>\u2018If you really believed that my love was true, it would\u2019ve been easier for both of us. But you never trusted me. Not even once.\u2019</p><br/><p>Ares Valentine thought to himself while maintaining his smile.</p><br/><p>He\u2019d fought with Enbi Arin for a long time and had shown her his affection for a long time as well.</p><br/><p>She should have trusted him at least once by now.</p><br/><p>But Enbi Arin had always suspected him.</p><br/><p>And that was the answer.</p><br/><p>If Enbi Arin really did believe in him, even for a single moment.</p><br/><p>If she used his emotions against him to disregard her defense when they fought.</p><br/><p>He would\u2019ve killed her.</p><br/><p>\u2018Too bad. Really, it\u2019s too bad.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014whooosh!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Ares Valentine smiled regretfully.</p><br/><p>Love was one thing, and work was another.</p><br/><p>The emotion of love is best maintained at a convenient level.</p><br/><p>He had a job given to him by Clementine.</p><br/><p>And that came at a much higher priority than his own emotions.</p><br/><p>Emotions were to be enjoyed, not something to risk his life over.</p><br/><p>And Enbi Arin had neither believed in his affection nor had she ever used it against him.</p><br/><p>Even in a situation like this where she was at a disadvantage.</p><br/><p>\u2018If only you\u2019d trusted me once\u2026 I would\u2019ve allowed you to be at peace.\u2019</p><br/><p>The warm smile on Ares Valentine\u2019s face suddenly turned evil.[a]</p><br/><p>The reason why their battle seemed prolonged was because Enbi Arin was playing in a very safe style, blocking his moves one by one.</p><br/><p>Blocking away the short sword and staying wary of the incoming long sword.</p><br/><p>\u2018I guess I\u2019ll have to take the more annoying route.\u2019</p><br/><p>Ares Valentine smacked his lips and grasped onto the two swords tightly.</p><br/><p>Because he\u2019d dropped his guard, he half-expected her to charge in wildly, but it\u2019s apparently hard to change a person\u2019s personality.</p><br/><p>And if petty tricks like these didn\u2019t work, then there was only one method.</p><br/><p>\u201cToo bad. If I had nothing to do, then\u2026 I could\u2019ve played with you for a bit more.\u201d</p><br/><p>His affection for Enbi Arin hadn\u2019t all been a lie.</p><br/><p>But the situation wasn\u2019t quite the best to be all lovey-dovey.</p><br/><p>He had to finish this and climb up.</p><br/><p>\u2018Too bad. It\u2019s hard to find a woman like her.\u2019</p><br/><p>But now was the time to end it all.</p><br/><p>And then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014kiiiiiing\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014the short and long swords on Ares Valentine\u2019s hands started to get covered in a yellow reinforcement.</p><br/><p>Ares swung the now longer swords as he walked towards Enbi Arin, smiling as he said:</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll carry you well. You might lose a few parts, but\u2026 I\u2019ll just fix you up when I get there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014swooosh!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Ares Valentine\u2019s swords started to swing through the air and towards Enbi Arin.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014 </p><br/><p>Lightning crashed down all around, radiating a tremendous amount of energy.</p><br/><p>Melchizedek\u2019s giant castle was overflowing with energy from the giant crystal.</p><br/><p>\u2014kyaooooo!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2018It seems to be quite happy.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo thought as he looked at his blue armor that was making cheerful sounds.</p><br/><p>Well, it made sense.</p><br/><p>The blue armor was something that a certain race had used. That race had also created this giant Nelkipa and the crystal that controlled the Nelkipa.</p><br/><p>It made a lot of sense that the blue armor was gleefully receiving the energy of the crystal.</p><br/><p>And the deeper he went in, the more concentrated the energy radiating outwards.</p><br/><p>\u2018Too bad the energy\u2019s not being used to raise its battle power.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo thought to himself as he continued deeper.</p><br/><p>He wished that the blue armor could use the energy like the Dragon God Armor, but it didn\u2019t seem like that was the case.</p><br/><p>Hansoo gave up trying to use the overflowing energy and hastened his speed further inside.</p><br/><p>\u2014tatatatak\u2014 </p><br/><p>But as Hansoo ran\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014something fired at him from a distance.</p><br/><p>A much more powerful beam than before.</p><br/><p>\u2018Heeeup!\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo swung the hammer in his hand and deflected the strike away.</p><br/><p>But this was just the beginning, as countless beams started to converge onto his location from the depths of the castle.</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014zoooooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Even though the heat from the beams could easily melt any metal nearby, the controls were so meticulous that the giant castle remained unscratched.</p><br/><p>Hansoo frowned as he received these concentrated attacks and then poured some of his strength into the hammer.</p><br/><p>And then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014whooosh!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014Hansoo threw the hammer in his hand with all his strength.</p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>And as the hammer flew off like a meteor, slamming into the depths\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014a huge sound reverberated as it destroyed all the cannons set up deep inside.</p><br/><p>\u2014chiiijijik!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo glanced at the cannons that had stopped firing and continued heading inside.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Annoying.\u2019</p><br/><p>These attacks kept repeating since the beginning.</p><br/><p>Melchizedek was using up all the energy inside the defensive cannons to fire single shots at him.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t to the point of killing him but more than enough to hold him down momentarily.</p><br/><p>And this giant castle was filled with these defensive structures.</p><br/><p>Thanks to that, it had taken him longer to scout out the castle as well.</p><br/><p>\u2018If that was your goal, then good job. Melchizedek, you\u2019ve hidden yourself very well.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo looked around as he continued inwards.</p><br/><p>He\u2019d initially thought that he just needed to follow the flow of energy.</p><br/><p>But it wasn\u2019t that simple.</p><br/><p>The concentration of energy inside was so high that it was difficult to find its point of origin.</p><br/><p>And being dazed from the cannons interfered with his search as well.</p><br/><p>At this rate, he might have to explore the entire city.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s larger than a whole city.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo thought to himself.</p><br/><p>Although it looked considerably large from the outside, there was a part of it hidden underground which made it even bigger.</p><br/><p>At this rate, he didn\u2019t know how long it would take to reach his goal.</p><br/><p>As Hansoo frowned\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014oooooong\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014a loud sound echoed throughout the castle.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014whoooosh!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014the overflowing energy within the castle started to flow into a specific location within the city.</p><br/><p>Just like a storm.</p><br/><p>\u2014whooooosh!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014kiiiiing\u2014 </p><br/><p>And with a sudden noise, all the surrounding cannons that were firing at him abruptly lost their energy.</p><br/><p>\u2018Was it there?\u2019</p><br/><p>There was no way he couldn\u2019t know.</p><br/><p>Hansoo felt the tremendous change within the castle and started running deeper inside.</p><br/><p>Towards the center where all the energy was quickly flowing to.</p><br/><p>But at that moment\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014chiiijijik\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014something appeared in the air.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo scoffed at this scene.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor you to appear yourself. It seems you got a bit impatient.\u201d</p><br/><p>Melchizedek spat out in reply.</p><br/><p>Well, Melchizedek\u2019s hologram to be exact.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease. You won\u2019t be able to stop the cause of this change in energy flow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Melchizedek chuckled coldly and asked:</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know why you\u2019re trying so hard. Did you see your friend? You could\u2019ve slept like her as well. It\u2019s not too late you know. If you give up now, then I\u2019ll treat you to that as well. It\u2019s not a bad deal right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014boom! boom! boom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo ignored it and focused on running, causing Melchizedek to shrug at his actions.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems that friend you woke up is in a precarious situation. If she stayed in the dream I made for her then she wouldn\u2019t have to suffer like this in reality. She\u2019ll definitely die at this rate, so is it fine to leave her like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo replied to Melchizedek\u2019s mumbles:</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll handle it well. I heard your dream was really trashy, but\u2026 there was something positive about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>Melchizedek was confused by Hansoo\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh. Damn\u2026 How\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ares Valentine mumbled in confusion.</p><br/><p>While staring at Enbi Arin\u2019s fist currently embedded in his stomach.</p><br/><p>He was finding it difficult to breathe.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn\u2026 There shouldn\u2019t be any gaps in my defenses?\u2019</p><br/><p>How hard had he worked to improve his swordsmanship?</p><br/><p>The swordsmanship created from the simultaneous swings of his short and long swords was something that even Clementine had praised him for.</p><br/><p>But what was this?</p><br/><p>Ares was at a loss at the fist that had penetrated through his defenses and had punched through his stomach.</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin, who was a single breath away, whispered to him:</p><br/><p>\u201cLook here, you bastard. You and I\u2026 we lived together for fifteen years.\u201d</p><br/><p>They had spent fifteen years in a dream.</p><br/><p>Of course, a husband and wife would know each other very well.</p><br/><p>\u2014tududuk\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2018Melchizedek\u2026 thanks for this, you bastard. For allowing me to experience such a realistic dream.\u2019</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin thought as she twisted her fist into Ares Valentine\u2019s stomach.</p><br/><p>[a]https://puu.sh/AqCu9/d3a2c7d8b6.png</p><br/>\n</div>"}

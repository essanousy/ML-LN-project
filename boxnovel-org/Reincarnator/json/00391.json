This was before the Abyss fell\u2026 Are those guys Clementine\u2019s allies?\u2019</p><br/><p>Kiriel froze as she looked at the memory.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t seem like Clementine\u2019s forces.</p><br/><p>A few people shone within the memories of Erunheim.</p><br/><p>The handsome man called Keldian who was voicing his opinions.</p><br/><p>The man who agreed with Keldian called Kangtae.</p><br/><p>And a beautiful woman listening to their words with a serious expression.</p><br/><p>\u2018Her name is\u2026 Eres? What a beauty.\u2019</p><br/><p>But there was someone who shone even more brightly than these people.</p><br/><p>A man who was smiling from the back.</p><br/><p>\u2018...I can\u2019t see him clearly.\u2019</p><br/><p>The appearance of that man was very blurry for some reason.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t seem like Erunheim had focused much attention on him.</p><br/><p>Since this memory was showing that Keldian and the others wanted to leave. </p><br/><p>The expressions of Erunheim and the leaders of Reyunion were grim.</p><br/><p>They were in a very grim situation.</p><br/><p>The Neropa Union terrorized them outside the Flameless Land.</p><br/><p>But staying inside, they could not defeat the monsters without these people.</p><br/><p>The expressions of Keldian and a few others froze at the naggings of these people, while Eres and a few others couldn\u2019t seem to ignore their pleas.</p><br/><p>Of course.</p><br/><p>The difficulty continued to rise as they went up.</p><br/><p>And the issue of internal conflict existed.</p><br/><p>Reyunion\u2019s main forces comprised of Eres\u2019s people\u2014 the others wanted to either kill off the people of Reyunion or turn them into slaves.</p><br/><p>They just stayed silent because Eres was too powerful.</p><br/><p>But if they all left, the people of Reyunion would all be reduced to become slaves.</p><br/><p>And not only that.</p><br/><p>If they blocked this place off, then those coming up after them would be in danger.</p><br/><p>But to go up after leaving behind a few forces here, the situation above would be too grim.</p><br/><p>But at that moment\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014someone spoke.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>A few others spoke out to remain.</p><br/><p>And Eres and the others decided to go up after leaving the rest to these people.</p><br/><p>Erunheim\u2019s uneasiness was clearly palpable.</p><br/><p>At the remaining forces who didn\u2019t seem powerful enough to deal with the monsters.</p><br/><p>But fighting against their choices would only lead to their deaths.</p><br/><p>So Erunheim and the other leaders stayed silent.</p><br/><p>But the moment Eres and the others left, the situation changed.</p><br/><p>Towards a completely different direction.</p><br/><p>And all the forces gathered under the two people who remained to protect them.</p><br/><p>But of course, the peace didn\u2019t last long.</p><br/><p>Everyone turned grim at the events that happened afterward.</p><br/><p>And with those words, all the other aliens pretending to be in opposing forces all gathered to the center.</p><br/><p>Of course, Reyunion\u2019s territory had turned into a mess.</p><br/><p>After all, rather than hunting the monsters all around them, the aliens had gathered in that place instead. There was nobody else to block the monsters.</p><br/><p>Although they were able to hold on to some degree with their mechanical weapons, it did not solve the core issue.</p><br/><p>After the deaths of tens of millions of people in Reyunion, Erunheim and the others suppressed their fears and went to the aliens.</p><br/><p>But then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014their cold expressions were still very clear within Erunheim\u2019s memories.</p><br/><p>&lt;...&gt;</p><br/><p>Erunheim clenched her teeth and backed off.</p><br/><p>Their words were right.</p><br/><p>Erunheim decided to be thankful that it hadn\u2019t ended in a massacre as she gathered up the other leaders of Reyunion, quickly forming a defensive line to push back the monsters.</p><br/><p>Thankfully, the forces of monsters had diminished quite a bit after the aliens hunted them down to increase their own strength.</p><br/><p>Because they had struggled so hard to protect their territory, they had formed a decent line of defense.</p><br/><p>Of course, it didn\u2019t last long.</p><br/><p>Three months.</p><br/><p>It only took three months for their world to be flipped upside down.</p><br/><p>A strange elevator slammed down from the sky and onto the center of their territory.</p><br/><p>And even more powerful monsters started to crawl out from that elevator.</p><br/><p>If they could fight the previous monsters with mechanical weapons.</p><br/><p>Then only the power of the Flame could deal with these new monsters.</p><br/><p>If the aliens hadn\u2019t been shocked at the sudden appearance of these monsters and hadn\u2019t immediately hunted them down, then all the remaining people in Reyunion would\u2019ve been killed off within a month.</p><br/><p>And everything continued to be chaotic after that.</p><br/><p>New aliens continued to rise up.</p><br/><p>And they had survived in the small gap created between the battles of the original aliens and the new aliens.</p><br/><p>The past two years was chaos in itself.</p><br/><p>But there was a force that shone even brighter than the others within those years.</p><br/><p>The man who rose up quickly while Clementine\u2019s forces had been distracted.</p><br/><p>The man who had become strong enough to push back Clementine\u2019s forces.</p><br/><p>Kiriel exclaimed out loud after she finished with the memories of what Erunheim had gone through.</p><br/><p>\u201cWoah\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Amazing.

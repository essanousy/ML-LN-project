Isn\u2019t it time for me to work solo for a bit?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...Hmm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mudusella and Cykrus both shook their heads.</p><br/><p>One clearly showing disappointment.</p><br/><p>Another didn\u2019t show it but still had a similar expression.</p><br/><p>\u2018Can a person change this much? Such a waste.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cykrus, the one who had clearly shown a disappointed expression, thought to himself.</p><br/><p>He personally liked people who strived for the well-being of many people or for the greater good.</p><br/><p>Since he himself had become a general because of this.</p><br/><p>Though he had met him as an enemy in the beginning, he had felt a lot of sympathy for Hansoo who was working himself to death for the humankind.</p><br/><p>Putting one\u2019s life on the line for someone else was not an easy feat.</p><br/><p>He had thought that it was part of Hansoo\u2019s nature to help others but it seemed like it was due to the restraints he had.</p><br/><p>He had heard something akin to it from Mudusella on the way but he still kept his hopes up just in case a similar personality remained.</p><br/><p>But it was for naught.</p><br/><p>\u2018Too bad I guess\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Cykrus stopped paying attention to Hansoo and turned around.</p><br/><p>Mudusella smiled awkwardly between the two and spoke to Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo\u2026 What will you do now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo understood the meaning behind her words as he chuckled.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust drop me off anywhere suitable. Hmm...Yeah. Behind the mountain range should be good. There\u2019s something I must do hidden away from the people\u2019s eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mudusella was embarrassed because Hansoo had understood her meaning of her wanting to leave this place quickly as she nodded.</p><br/><p>The more time she dragged on the more variables would come into play.</p><br/><p>TMT-1 received Mudusella\u2019s orders and quickly drove the ship towards the other side of the mountain range.</p><br/><p>But at that moment, Cykrus couldn\u2019t hold back his anger and spat his words out.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really are a scoundrel. Do you not see the chaos outside? Don\u2019t you feel any responsibility?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cykrus pointed towards the outside scenery the screen on the wall was showing.</p><br/><p>A corner of the Spirit Land.</p><br/><p>A scene of chaos.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey probably realize it by now. That you abandoned them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Samuel Kinar, a Ten Thousand Men General, mumbled as he stared at the giant elevator in the distance.</p><br/><p>\u2018...This feels incredibly ill-boding.\u2019</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t just talking about the feeling he was getting.</p><br/><p>Kyaaaaak!</p><br/><p>From the tower.</p><br/><p>Tremendous screams and roars could be heard.</p><br/><p>Sounds of things breaking and smashing apart.</p><br/><p>Crash!</p><br/><p>Booom!</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>He could hear complaints next to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn\u2026 Leader, do you know anything about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Samuel shook his head at the words of the Thousand Men Captain.</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t known anything about this.</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>John Stone, the Thousand Men Captain who had complained, asked back cautiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this linked to Kang Hansoo?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...Him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Samuel Kinar started to think.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Yeah. Something is off.\u2019</p><br/><p>They could slowly figure out if it was true but if it was really linked to Hansoo, the information they received from him was priceless.</p><br/><p>A piece of knowledge could determine life and death in a bad situation.</p><br/><p>Pushing aside the fact that he publicized this knowledge, the origin of all this information was suspicious.</p><br/><p>Where could he have gotten all of this information?</p><br/><p>And if he knew about it, why did he say it right as this huge change was about to fall upon them?</p><br/><p>\u2018...There\u2019s too much we don\u2019t know about. He just told us how to deal with the monsters from the elevators and nothing else.\u2019</p><br/><p>He grew even more curious as Hansoo only spoke the most important and crucial information as if he was running out of time.</p><br/><p>John Stone spoke to Samuel again.</p><br/><p>\u201cThink about it. Isn\u2019t something strange? The moment he spoke, these things happened. And didn\u2019t the fairy say it? That this opportunity has come because of Hansoo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...\u201d</p><br/><p>Kinar frowned at the word opportunity.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t like this opportunity that the fairy spoke about.</p><br/><p>To a normal person, an opportunity was something that had a small amount of risk in comparison to the large reward.</p><br/><p>But the fairy never spoke lies.</p><br/><p>Which meant that this was a high risk and extremely high rewarding case.</p><br/><p>The fairy, which didn\u2019t even appear during normal times, actually appeared and told everyone that the elevators were a huge opportunity.</p><br/><p>Which meant that those elevators were extremely dangerous.</p><br/><p>Way more than anything they had gone through in the hell-like Yellow and Green Zones.</p><br/><p>And according to the fairy\u2019s words, Kang Hansoo had brought all of this upon them.</p><br/><p>John Stone got excited as Samuel frowned more and more.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook. This is all caused by that bastard. Why isn\u2019t he appearing now? He really dislikes internal strife, he should be all over us right now trying to quiet us down.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...\u201d</p><br/><p>Samuel agreed.</p><br/><p>Hansoo did not like internal strife.</p><br/><p>Every time it happened, he would rush over and either suppress all of them or make a deal with them.</p><br/><p>Like he was obsessed.</p><br/><p>And the Red, Orange and Yellow Zones were controlled under an absolute rule.</p><br/><p>The reason why they were able to complain like this was because there was no method of controlling them in the Green Zone.</p><br/><p>People were complaining with rage-filled eyes due to the lack of control and the huge change that suddenly struck them.</p><br/><p>\u201c...Fuck! Explain this!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is going on!\u201d</p><br/><p>Though they were complaining, there was a reason why they couldn\u2019t revolt or cause a ruckus.</p><br/><p>In the distance.</p><br/><p>The Ains that stayed behind and surrounded them.</p><br/><p>Because of their existence.</p><br/><p>The current Ains were much stronger than them.</p><br/><p>Much stronger.</p><br/><p>What if the Ains were the method of control Hansoo left behind for them?</p><br/><p>\u2018...At this rate, we might need to go to the frontlines if we\u2019re unlucky.\u2019</p><br/><p>He was feeling uneasy about the action of going into the giant elevator.</p><br/><p>If they need to use meat shields, who would they use?</p><br/><p>Those who listened or those who didn\u2019t?</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn...This is too real.\u2019</p><br/><p>Samuel Kinar mumbled.</p><br/><p>It was hard to think that someone who paid so much attention to controlling them in the Red, Orange and Yellow Zones wouldn\u2019t care about it in the Green Zone.</p><br/><p>And he didn\u2019t even bring them up to the Yellow Zone before the Satellite Fortresses were ready.</p><br/><p>Despite it being easier to fight together with them.</p><br/><p>People who were at such a high rank were trying very hard to calm down the people below.</p><br/><p>\u2018Amazing.\u2019</p><br/><p>Samuel Kinar was at a loss for words.</p><br/><p>That man wasn\u2019t even here.</p><br/><p>But every one of them were contemplating every single one of his past actions.</p><br/><p>Samuel was terrified at the tremendous amount of influence the man had.</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>Rummble.</p><br/><p>In the distance.</p><br/><p>A single ship that hadn\u2019t fused with the elevators started to fly towards them.</p><br/><p>Maybe because it was designed to fly into space, the speed at which it flew allowed it to arrive by them almost instantly.</p><br/><p>Rummmblee!</p><br/><p>Samuel almost got blown away by the winds created by the giant ship and frowned as he stood in place.</p><br/><p>\u2018I knew it. He\u2019s already had everything prepared.\u2019</p><br/><p>Every person who had been complaining or making a ruckus fell silent as the ship arrived above them.</p><br/><p>\u2018Since he returned\u2026 I guess we can at least hear what\u2019s going on.\u2019</p><br/><p>They would at least be able to hear explanations since the ship came back.</p><br/><p>But as Samuel sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone on board! It is time for us to leave!\u201d</p><br/><p>The voice of a woman was heard instead.</p><br/><p>\u2018...It\u2019s not Hansoo?\u2019</p><br/><p>Mudusella was speaking towards the Ains.</p><br/><p>\u2018What the\u2026 Kang Hansoo? Where did you go?\u2019</p><br/><p>As Kinar frowned in confusion.</p><br/><p>Something unbelievable happened.</p><br/><p>The Ains, whom he thought were watching over them, started to fly into the ship.</p><br/><p>\u2018What the hell\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>But as Samuel was about to speak.</p><br/><p>Somebody was faster than him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! What the hell man! Where the hell are you guys going?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018...Fucking John Stone. Why are you asking with so much hostility?\u2019</p><br/><p>The same words would sound different if spoken differently.</p><br/><p>Samuel was about to speak to cover the hostile words of John but Mudusella answered calmly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will leave this planet. We do not want to live here anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Samuel looked towards the Ains in shock.</p><br/><p>Most of the thousands of Ains were flying onto the ship.</p><br/><p>They wouldn\u2019t be able to control them with the few remaining behind.</p><br/><p>\u2018They weren\u2019t here to control us?\u2019</p><br/><p>But while Samuel and the other Ten Thousand Men Generals were shocked.</p><br/><p>John Stone asked back as if he knew this would all happen.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know where he went then?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mudusella kept her smile as she replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe left our ship previously. He said that there was something he would need to do by himself.\u201d</p><br/><p>John Stone shouted proudly the moment he heard this.</p><br/><p>\u201cI knew this would happen! See? This is all caused by that bastard! He caused this and just ran away by himself!\u201d</p><br/><p>As his words were heard.</p><br/><p>Mumble mumble.</p><br/><p>The the fear of the one who could control this suddenly disappeared and they felt freedom as a result.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck\u2026 Really?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn\u2026 What do we do then!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shouts were heard all around them.</p><br/><p>And Samuel frowned seeing this.</p><br/><p>\u2018What are you planning John?\u2019</p><br/><p>John Stone was vicious but was still a Thousand Men captain.</p><br/><p>He wouldn\u2019t act like this without any plans.</p><br/><p>He should know that making people uneasy clearly wouldn\u2019t be good but for him to do such a thing.</p><br/><p>Samuel glared at John.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Below the mountain range.</p><br/><p>Two shadows laid on the ground in the depths of the harsh snowstorm.</p><br/><p>A shadow who was lying down with an exhausted expression unbefitting of the vacation he spoke of.</p><br/><p>And the shadow of a small creature flying around in glee in the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha! A smart person indeed acts quickly! I should\u2019ve watched the scenery a bit more before I came to give you your reward. Anyways, how\u2019s your body?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think? It\u2019s a mess.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018But still...It\u2019s progressing well.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

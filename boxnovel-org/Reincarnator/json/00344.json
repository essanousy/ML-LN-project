</p><br/><p>Countless pillars of flames fell down from the sky and smashed into the ground.</p><br/><p>\u2014boom!\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014booooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The few pieces of scrap and rubble left behind immediately evaporated into gas.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t even liquify and instead had immediately turned into gas.</p><br/><p>\u2018Oh my god.\u2019</p><br/><p>Jack was in a daze as he stared at the super dense materials disappearing into nothing.</p><br/><p>The materials didn\u2019t even get hit directly yet.</p><br/><p>\u2014bobooboom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Tens of thousands of attacks were flying towards them, but the Nelkipa was so huge that those attacks had quite a distance between them before they struck down.</p><br/><p>But the issue lay somewhere else.</p><br/><p>\u201cWon\u2019t we all die at this rate?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014roaaarr!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Jack shouted, listening to the giant roars of Nelkipa.</p><br/><p>Even if they didn\u2019t get hit by those attacks, would it matter?</p><br/><p>If this giant lifeform they were all standing on melted down, they would follow suit.</p><br/><p>Since they\u2019d end up lost in space.</p><br/><p>And looking at the tens of thousands of attacks that were striking at them, that was actually a possibility.</p><br/><p>Even if the lifeform was the size of a moon, the attacks striking at them seemed to have the power to do so.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo just pointed towards the ground below.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook below.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...?\u201d</p><br/><p>And as Jack looked down, he couldn\u2019t believe his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2018No way\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014ssssss\u2014 </p><br/><p>Beneath the melting and evaporating city.</p><br/><p>A bright land appeared.</p><br/><p>Well, the bright skin of the lifeform they were on\u2014the Nelkipa\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014boom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Although countless pillars of flames were striking down at the ground, the Nelkipa\u2019s skin seemed to be fine.</p><br/><p>\u2018Wha\u2026what?\u2019</p><br/><p>Kiriel was at a loss.</p><br/><p>Nelkipa\u2019s skin should not be able to withstand such a powerful attack.</p><br/><p>He knew this because the excavation center he had been living in was tasked with the job of digging into Nelkipa\u2019s skin.</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t known it was the skin back then, but because it consisted of metals and ores, he knew that even ordinary people like him could melt it down.</p><br/><p>Although the skin had grown increasingly harder the deeper they dug, they had managed to dig through the surface so it should\u2019ve melted down at least.</p><br/><p>Jack focused his eyes on this strange sight, and then soon realized why the Nelkipa\u2019s bright skin could resist the attacks.</p><br/><p>\u2018That\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>The bright blue layers, which they had believed to be veins of ore, were transforming.</p><br/><p>Resembling crystals or diamonds.</p><br/><p>\u2014boom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>As another attack smashed into the surface of Nelkipa, the several hundred meters of skin started to turn bright and shiny.</p><br/><p>It then dispersed, absorbed, and deflected almost every bit of the remaining fire.</p><br/><p>Like a drop of rain hitting an umbrella and sliding down, the countless pillars of flame could not penetrate into Nelkipa\u2019s skin and instead spread back into space.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is why Melchizedek wanted it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014boom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014boooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo replied expressionlessly beside them as they watched the attacks raining down from above.</p><br/><p>Melchizedek wasn\u2019t stupid.</p><br/><p>It wouldn\u2019t start a war that it had no chances of winning against.</p><br/><p>Just Angkara\u2019s attacks alone weren\u2019t enough to stop Nelkipa.</p><br/><p>Kiriel looked confused as she asked Hansoo:</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2026 made this?\u201d</p><br/><p>She\u2019d initially thought that this might be a natural born creature, but her thoughts had now changed.</p><br/><p>Looking at everything from the cannons and the marks on the skin, it was clear that somebody had built this artificially.</p><br/><p>Hansoo shrugged his shoulders at her words.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow would I know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014rummmble\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014 </p><br/><p>If they\u2019d made this at the main planet, Angkara, they would have never set up an excavation center in the first place.</p><br/><p>Since there would\u2019ve been no reason for the colony to investigate something they had made themselves.</p><br/><p>Of course, that wasn\u2019t the important thing in the current situation.</p><br/><p>\u2014boom! boom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo looked at the raining attacks as he said:</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...Where?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jack replied with a heavy voice amidst the thundering booms.</p><br/><p>Where could they go in this current situation?</p><br/><p>Hansoo replied:</p><br/><p>\u201cTo the research center. As per our original plan.\u201d</p><br/><p>This giant creature, Nelkipa, was headed for the main planet .</p><br/><p>Under Melchizedek\u2019s control.</p><br/><p>If they left it alone, then it would definitely reach the and land on the planet.</p><br/><p>Then the true war would begin.</p><br/><p>Between the slowly accumulated forces of Melchizedek on the Nelkipa\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014and the race of Angkara who\u2019d been tempered by countless battles and wars.</p><br/><p>\u2018I cannot let that happen.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo thought to himself.</p><br/><p>He could not.</p><br/><p>The 5th zone would become a true sea of flames at that point.</p><br/><p>Something much worse than this.</p><br/><p>This was just the beginning.</p><br/><p>This was not the most powerful attack that Angkara could send out.</p><br/><p>It was just the fastest and easiest method of attack, which is why they\u2019d activated it the moment Nelkipa started to move.</p><br/><p>He needed to act before the war became more serious and more powerful weapons came into play.</p><br/><p>He needed to take control of this giant monster.</p><br/><p>And the easiest method was\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018Catching Melchizedek.\u2019</p><br/><p>Melchizedek\u2019s underlings were the ones that actually fought.</p><br/><p>Which meant Melchizedek should be at the topmost or the bottommost floor.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hostages have traditionally been proven to be useful.\u2019</p><br/><p>Since he didn\u2019t have the strength to go to the actual control center yet, this was the next best option.</p><br/><p>But there were clearly a few people who did not agree with him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Are you crazy? You don\u2019t even know if there\u2019s anything still there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn! Shouldn\u2019t we be heading to the elevator instead?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jack and the others who had followed Hansoo shouted in objection.</p><br/><p>How would they know if anything remained of the research center?</p><br/><p>It should\u2019ve been turned into a pile of dust by now.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo only chuckled at them.</p><br/><p>\u201cI never told to you follow me, right? And the research center should be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Before they could continue\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving. Let\u2019s go Kiriel.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014Hansoo loosened his hand and fell down to the ground a few kilometers beneath them.</p><br/><p>\u2014boom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u201cCrazy bas\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As Jack was at a loss watching Hansoo and Kiriel falling down\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014one of the people who\u2019d followed Jack asked from behind:</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat shall we do now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Whether they went to the elevator or followed them, going down was the first priority.</p><br/><p>Of course, he still had questions.</p><br/><p>\u2018The research center should be fine? What did he mean by that?\u2019</p><br/><p>But Jack soon pushed away that thought as he focused on getting back down to the ground.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u2014boooooooooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014boooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u201cUgh\u2026 Everyone focus on using ice-type skills and movement-type skills!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jack shouted out.</p><br/><p>The moment they returned to the ground, a blazing degree of heat smacked them right on their bodies.</p><br/><p>The metallic steam threatened to scorch their lungs, and the heat deflected from Nelkipa\u2019s bright skin threatened to cook the soles of their shoes.</p><br/><p>Of course, the attacks hadn\u2019t stopped either.</p><br/><p>\u2014rummble\u2014 </p><br/><p>Jack watched the line of fire, calculated its trajectory and then shouted:</p><br/><p>\u201cDodge!\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as he shouted out, everyone activated their movement skills to the max and started to run away from their current positions.</p><br/><p>And as they escaped\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014booooooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014the area surrounding their previous location had turned into a sea of fire several hundred meters wide.</p><br/><p>From the giant pillar of fire that had come down from the sky.</p><br/><p>\u2026chiiiii\u2026</p><br/><p>Despite dodging the fire, another wave of heat blasted down on their faces, so strong that it had almost destroyed their defensive skills.</p><br/><p>Jack started to frown.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn. Thank god it moves in a straight line.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was an extremely fast attack, but due to the sheer distance of its origin, one could easily predict where it would land.</p><br/><p>If they couldn\u2019t, then they would be roasted whole by now.</p><br/><p>\u2018This\u2026 this would even destroy the robots as well. Should we just run to the elevator?\u2019</p><br/><p>Jack mumbled as he measured the heat on the ground.</p><br/><p>They wouldn't melt down from this heat, but these attacks were not something those robots could withstand.</p><br/><p>Which meant that even their tiny group would be able to get past the robots and reach the elevator.</p><br/><p>\u2018But\u2026 what do we do after we go up?\u2019</p><br/><p>This giant Nelkipa was the entire 5th zone.</p><br/><p>Even if they went up a floor, it was still above the Nelkipa.</p><br/><p>They wouldn\u2019t be able to dodge the flames anyway.</p><br/><p>And more than anything else, he could not give up on Kiriel.</p><br/><p>\u2018Where did they even go?\u2019</p><br/><p>Jack, completely bewitched by Kiriel, looked around to try and guess which direction she had gone.</p><br/><p>\u2014boooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014clang!\u2014 </p><br/><p>At that moment, they could hear the sounds of clashes in the distance.</p><br/><p>\u2018There!\u2019</p><br/><p>As Jack subconsciously followed the sound\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? You followed us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014a voice could be heard through the metallic steam clouds.</p><br/><p>\u2018Woah.\u2019</p><br/><p>Jack was shocked because he was still some distance away from the location of the sound.</p><br/><p>He had thought that they\u2019d be fighting together.</p><br/><p>He saw that Kiriel was staring into the distance as if enchanted.</p><br/><p>\u2018What is she looking at?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014boooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014boom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Something was fighting against something else and causing a huge ruckus.</p><br/><p>\u2018Who is he fighting with?\u2019</p><br/><p>The metallic steam and the powerful shock waves had turned the surrounding air hazy.</p><br/><p>It was clear that the silhouette swinging the hammer around was Hansoo, but he could not identify the other being that Hansoo was fighting against.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014booooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2018F***...!\u2019</p><br/><p>Jack freaked out at the pillar of flame that was aiming straight at them.</p><br/><p>And shockingly, three of those pillars combined with one another, and their range had increased to the entire surroundings in its area.</p><br/><p>At this rate, that attack would hit everyone here.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn, we have to dodge.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Mr. Hansoo! Dodge it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014boom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>He shouted at Hansoo, who was still fighting within the metallic steam, but Hansoo didn\u2019t seem to hear as he continued to focus on attacking his opponent.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>He had shouted to help, but there was no way for him to drag Hansoo out forcibly.</p><br/><p>Of course, he didn\u2019t want to do it either.</p><br/><p>He then grabbed Kiriel\u2019s wrist and pulled her back.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease! We have to move!\u201d</p><br/><p>And as if she understood his words, she moved back and out of range as well.</p><br/><p>Jack\u2019s expression brightened up.</p><br/><p>To him, it seemed like she had given Hansoo up.</p><br/><p>\u2018Good.\u2019</p><br/><p>And as they all escaped the range of the attack\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014boooooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014a giant pillar of flame crashed down from the sky, followed by blazing waves of heat that swept over them.</p><br/><p>Jack inwardly sighed in relief as he looked at the scene since Hansoo should\u2019ve been hit directly by it.</p><br/><p>\u2018Good. This is\u2026 for the better.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was sad that Hansoo had died that way, but this was good.</p><br/><p>Since it wouldn\u2019t be good for him to follow that dumb bastard who\u2019d insisted on going to the research center in a situation like this.</p><br/><p>If Hansoo had died, then Kiriel wouldn\u2019t have anyone to rely on. He just needed to seduce her well and then take her up.</p><br/><p>\u2014tatata\u2014 </p><br/><p>As Jack thought to himself\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014Kiriel\u2019s small words made Jack\u2019s eyes move towards the place where the flame pillar had been. She was still staring at the exact spot she had been in.</p><br/><p>And he freaked out.</p><br/><p>\u2018No way\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Amidst the sea of flames, something was continuously regenerating and burning up as it stood up.</p><br/><p>With a more powerful and condensed aura than before.</p><br/><p>Like a blade that had been retempered and refined again.</p><br/><p>As Jack saw this scene, chills ran down his entire back.</p><br/><p>\u2018He\u2026 he didn\u2019t dodge on purpose. That insane bastard.\u2019</p><br/><p>Was that something a sane person would do?</p><br/><p>Jack continued to stare, at a loss for words.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

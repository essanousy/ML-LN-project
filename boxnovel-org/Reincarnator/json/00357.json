I did what I had to.\u201d</p><br/><p>These were her honest thoughts.</p><br/><p>Thinking of what Enbi Arin had done, it was thanks to her that they\u2019d had such an easy time going through the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Zones.</p><br/><p>Hansoo glanced at Enbi Arin again and said:</p><br/><p>\u201cI will save this girl.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...How?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiriel\u2019s eyes widened.</p><br/><p>Of course, saving her was the right thing to do.</p><br/><p>But there weren\u2019t any methods she could think of, and there wasn\u2019t enough time left.</p><br/><p>\u2018One week.\u2019</p><br/><p>Kiriel thought to herself.</p><br/><p>She had meticulously checked Enbi Arin\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>At most, she had one week to live.</p><br/><p>And this was only because of her transcendent vitality.</p><br/><p>If any outside forces disturbed her, that might even shorten her time.</p><br/><p>Hansoo said:</p><br/><p>\u201cWe just need to turn her to into a 3-Star. That will heal most of her injuries.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiriel realized.</p><br/><p>He was right.</p><br/><p>If Enbi Arin rose up a rank, everything would be solved.</p><br/><p>But Kiriel soon shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019ll need a titanic amount of crystals.\u201d</p><br/><p>1-Star transcendents were common, but the amount of crystals one needed to make a 3-Star transcendent was on a different league of its own.</p><br/><p>Even if they could earn more and better crystals than the lower floors, acquiring that many crystals in that short of a time was impossible.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t enough time.</p><br/><p>\u2018And weirdly, there are no beings from the Abyssal race on this floor.\u2019</p><br/><p>Even the floor below hadn\u2019t been this bare.</p><br/><p>Hansoo shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Abyssal beings are attracted to where there are humans\u2014there are almost no humans around, so they aren\u2019t here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Predators would only gather around their prey.</p><br/><p>It was common logic.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that Melchizedek had killed off every Abyssal being on the 1st floor.</p><br/><p>They simply hadn\u2019t come to a place without prey.</p><br/><p>\u201c...Meaning that the humans are all gathered somewhere else.\u201d</p><br/><p>Melchizedek said that he\u2019d captured and taken away all the humans so she\u2019d thought the humans would\u2019ve been in the research center, but she realized something while she fought.</p><br/><p>That there weren\u2019t any humans here.</p><br/><p>She knew that a few humans would be used to create artificial transcendents, but they\u2019d taken too many away for it to be merely for that purpose.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why?\u2019</p><br/><p>But Kiriel soon came to a realization.</p><br/><p>\u201c...These guys also have a Nursery.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded.</p><br/><p>If that weren\u2019t the case, how else could they explain the sheer number of transcendents?</p><br/><p>Feed the humans to the Abyssal beings to raise their numbers, turn them into crystals to create transcendents and modify them to create artificial transcendents.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s really efficient, isn\u2019t he\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiriel mumbled, her expression cold.</p><br/><p>Melchizedek was using the humans in a very clean and efficient manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try to find where it is. It should be easy to find using Psychometry.\u201d</p><br/><p>It wouldn\u2019t separate such a large number of humans.</p><br/><p>For it to be really efficient, it would have gathered them all into one place.</p><br/><p>She just needed to find that place.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s probably on a different floor.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo thought to himself as he looked at Kiriel running off.</p><br/><p>\u2018Melchizedek\u2026 How did you become like this?\u2019</p><br/><p>The Melchizedek he knew wasn\u2019t this evil.</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s expression hardened.</p><br/><p>\u2018Finish the preparations on the upper floors.\u2019</p><br/><p>He needed to become a 3-Star before he reached the top floor anyway.</p><br/><p>If the Abyssal race had gathered in one place, he could resolve it all in one go.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s a bit dangerous, but I even acquired this\u2026 there are a lot of things different in this life.\u2019</p><br/><p>Legacy.</p><br/><p>And while Hansoo focused\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014chrrrrrk!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014something hidden beneath his skin quickly shot through to form a gauntlet around his hand, and then quickly disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Damn. Every single member of this race is a monster. Seriously.\u2019</p><br/><p>R-Korun Nell stared at this scene in horror, but then thought of the Kalkuroun Fleet.</p><br/><p>Although the Fusion Reactor\u2019s explosion would\u2019ve swept them away, it wouldn\u2019t be enough to destroy the entire fleet.</p><br/><p>Their strength wasn\u2019t that low.</p><br/><p>\u2018I wonder what happened\u2026 Damn. Well, I guess I\u2019m not in a position to worry about that.\u2019</p><br/><p>R-Korun Nell looked at the sky and remembered his current situation.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u201cHaa\u2026.Haaa.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...\u201d</p><br/><p>The flagship of the Kalkuroun Fleet, , was silent.</p><br/><p>Because of R-Koronaita Nell\u2019s anger.</p><br/><p>\u201c...How long until arrival?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re almost there.

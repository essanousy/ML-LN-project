Family matters should stay within the family, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>K-Adelaia Ron switched off the communication panel.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t know where that man was heading to.</p><br/><p>But it didn\u2019t matter.</p><br/><p>Maybe if they were hiding inside the trash dump where the power of the Flame was sealed, they would be safe, but\u2026</p><br/><p>The moment they came out, they won\u2019t be able to escape her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you think you\u2019ll be able to escape?\u2019</p><br/><p>K-Adelaia Ron chuckled as she looked at the face of Hansoo on the screen.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014</p><br/><p>In the land where the monsters have stomped through.</p><br/><p>Thousands of people had gathered.</p><br/><p>\u2018Haa\u2026 We have to move.\u2019</p><br/><p>Erunheim, who had gathered all the remaining survivors, looked towards Hansoo in the distance.</p><br/><p>The relic wasn\u2019t here and the fence that was protecting them had disappeared as well.</p><br/><p>Although they could use the power of the Flame\u2026</p><br/><p>She could feel her confidence shredding apart as she looked at the battle between the Pompeion Empire and the Neropa Union.</p><br/><p>The sky was collapsing as the earth was flipped upside down.</p><br/><p>The ship that they were on seemed nothing more than a small cargo ship in comparison to the ships in the distance.</p><br/><p>She was in disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u2018No way\u2026 Their technology has advanced this far already?\u2019</p><br/><p>She was at a loss.</p><br/><p>It had only been two years.</p><br/><p>The level of technology between them hadn\u2019t been that different back then.</p><br/><p>They were just much weaker in terms of the number of resources they had.</p><br/><p>But those ships in the distance.</p><br/><p>They were at least a whole generation ahead of them.</p><br/><p>And it had only been two years.</p><br/><p>\u2018...What happened? Weird.\u2019</p><br/><p>Erunheim gritted her teeth as she looked towards the ships in the distance.</p><br/><p>A whole generation of differences meant that at least 90% of their weapons were nothing more than scrap metal.</p><br/><p>Their opponent would be able to attack normally but their own gear wouldn\u2019t allow them to attack their enemies as freely.</p><br/><p>It would be a massacre.</p><br/><p>And as she thought up to this point\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014Erunheim stood up and walked towards Hansoo who was talking in the distance.</p><br/><p>\u2018He\u2026 He might know something.\u2019</p><br/><p>He was acting so confidently while everyone else was crying in despair.</p><br/><p>This was more than enough to stand out in this crowd</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have a plan? Or anything we can do to help\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>John Stone spoke out from nearby.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn\u2026 What can we do? Our amazing Kang Hansoo will solve everything! Killing monsters! Crushing ships!\u201d</p><br/><p>John Stone lay down on the floor while yelling sarcastically.</p><br/><p>\u2018F*** it. F*** everything. I\u2019m just going to go up.\u2019</p><br/><p>His original plan of trying to go against monsters like Hansoo was flawed from the get-go.</p><br/><p>He should have just gone up to work under somebody right from the beginning.</p><br/><p>Hansoo, who had been looking up into the sky, turned towards John Stone and smiled coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, there is a lot you can do. A lot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...?\u201d</p><br/><p>John Stone felt shivers run down his back as he saw both Hansoo\u2019s cold smile and Kiriel\u2019s look of pity.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve caught them\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><br/><p>R-Eronia Nell, who had been assigned to the rats, smiled.</p><br/><p>He had long felt pissed off due to the fact that he was assigned to dealing with rats instead of fighting the Pompeion Empire.</p><br/><p>Even more so since he, an R-level, was being watched over like the rats he was trying to catch.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>If he could deal with them himself then at least he wouldn\u2019t be this pissed.</p><br/><p>R-Eronia Nell decided to hurry and finish this mission, and he asked the Technorats:</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the Technorats scanning the entire planet with the satellites replied:</p><br/><p>\u201cThe 14th City. Etoreim.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014chiiiing!\u2014</p><br/><p>A scene appeared on the panel before them that displayed an area near the factories on the outskirts of Etoreim.</p><br/><p>Showing the alien pair who were covered in a dark cloth.</p><br/><p>\u2018Amazing\u2026 How did they activate the Quantum Transmission with just their bodies?\u2019</p><br/><p>R-Eronia Nell shrugged his shoulders as he looked at the pair who were walking out from a cloud of white smoke.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t have to deal with them anyway.</p><br/><p>\u2018Not a bad choice but\u2026 still.\u2019</p><br/><p>R-Eronia Nell chuckled.</p><br/><p>Although this was the original territory of the Kalkata tribe who eventually ran off to the trash dump, it was still one of the four cities that was protecting a Great Furnace.</p><br/><p>If they took that city down then it would be a huge blow as well.</p><br/><p>They had expected those two to do something great but for them to be aiming for such a small goal\u2026</p><br/><p>R-Eronia Nell scoffed at the Nell family\u2019s leader who had ordered him to watch over these two.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, it\u2019s good for me since my job is done.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cSend the report, tell them to activate the Quantum Transmission towards Etoreim as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>But then\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014countless voices started to speak out.</p><br/><p>\u201c...12th City outskirts, three aliens have been located.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Capital, Neoreim. Aliens have appeared in seven locations all at the same time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA total of 181 aliens are heading towards the nearby 54 cities within the Reyunion territory.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn\u2026 This location. 2nd City. Three aliens are heading towards this location! Hurry and prepare the Dragon God Soldiers!\u201d</p><br/><p>Dozens of panels started to appear before them.</p><br/><p>Hundreds of aliens covered in dark clothes and powerful auras appeared.</p><br/><p>No, they hadn\u2019t just appeared.</p><br/><p>\u2014boooom!\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014boom!\u2014</p><br/><p>As he watched them begin their attack\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014R-Eronia Nell felt something snap inside his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese rats\u2026 Wait. What about that guy? The guy with the blue armor?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe cannot be scanned. Due to the countless auras exploding out\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As he heard the flustered Technorat\u2019s report\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhhh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014R-Eronia Nell stood up and slammed his fists on the panels and roared towards the countless aliens on the screens.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Since I will make it happen. Be at ease and just leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even if Elkadion\u2019s plan went ahead without any problem, there wouldn\u2019t be that many benefits for the humans anyway.</p><br/><p>Since if Hansoo\u2019s plans were to progress the way he planned it then the humans would get strong enough to the point where they would be able to crush things like the Dekuromas with just their thumbs.</p><br/><p>Like how Hansoo had gotten strong enough to kill the Dragon race.</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked at Elkadion, who was looking back at him, and spoke out:</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will do our best to help your race how your race had helped us. But if your plans exist then we wouldn\u2019t be able to hold such an alliance.\u201d</p><br/><p>A tremendous pressure that pushed down on her soul rushed towards Elkadion.</p><br/><p>\u2018He did say he killed the Dragons, right.\u2019</p><br/><p>Elkadion grinded her teeth.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t that much of a difference in strength between them.</p><br/><p>Since the Dragon\u2019s Essence Blade was that powerful.</p><br/><p>But the pressure did not come from his strength.</p><br/><p>It came from the depths of the soul of the person who had roamed around the Abyss endlessly to the point where they had gotten strong enough to even kill those of the Dragon Race.</p><br/><p>Elkadion frowned slightly as she shouted out.</p><br/><p>At this point the gap that was between them was not something that strength alone couldn\u2019t close up.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can I trust the humans? Can you trust them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t trust in the humans, trust in me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Soul Fragment in that body. With that Soul Fragment the original owner of that body will become one of the seven kings who would have saved our race in the end. Of course the Akarons, which that king leads, would be treated well as an ally. Give up on that plan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo started to gather his strength as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u2018If you won\u2019t go out then I shall do it for you by force.\u2019</p><br/><p>The Dragon Essence Blade and the Crown of Thorns.</p><br/><p>Those two things combined their strength to push Taruhol out and allowed Elkadion to take over.</p><br/><p>If he were to pull out the Dragon Essence Blade from within the body then Elkadion would disappear and Taruhol would come in control again.</p><br/><p>Elkadion sighed as she looked at Hansoo.</p><br/><p>And then mumbled with a benevolent expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cI cannot leave yet. There\u2019s a lot of information I must hand down\u2026 And the Akarons need a leader more than anything else right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know that you\u2019re saying this because you\u2019re worried. But I shall show you. Your thoughts may change if you see me succeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo clicked his tongues as he saw the resolution within Elkadion\u2019s two eyes.</p><br/><p>These types were even harder to deal with.</p><br/><p>Since they weren\u2019t doing this from greed or profit.</p><br/><p>It was the eyes of those who believed that their ideas were completely correct and acted in order to change what was around them to fit that idea.</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess our talk ends here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo swung his spear as soon as his words left his mouth.</p><br/><p>Elkadion aggressively smashed her right hand towards the spear that was flying towards her.</p><br/><p>Goooooong!</p><br/><p>Though a hand and a spear had collided, a large sound of two bells colliding was heard instead.</p><br/><p>Charururuk</p><br/><p>The Dragon Essence Blade\u2019s bone fragments had climbed up Elkadion\u2019s body and had already created a small shield in front of her hand.</p><br/><p>Elkadion kept her smile as she spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell. I understand if you cannot comprehend. Then we must do our best from now on. And in addition\u2026 It\u2019s already in progress.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo clicked his tongue again as he started to slash his spear even faster.</p><br/><p>Boooooooom!</p><br/><p>Soon the room where the Great Temple\u2019s legacy was started to fill up with extremely loud sounds.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Kurururururu</p><br/><p>Oteon and Ailen who had been researching the Akadus within the Arklateori below the Holy Land slightly frowned at the sudden vibration that could be felt.</p><br/><p>\u2018What happened?\u2019</p><br/><p>Such a large collision shouldn\u2019t be happening.</p><br/><p>The Akarons and Humans had formed an alliance and there weren\u2019t any Tiradus or Margoths upon the Lazar.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well. We should just continue our work.\u2019</p><br/><p>A request that their leader, Elkadion, had asked of them.</p><br/><p>Oteon finished her thoughts as she looked at the Soul Telautograph in front of her eyes.</p><br/><p>Kiiiiiiinggg</p><br/><p>The Soul Telautograph that Elkadion had setup was letting out a blinding white light as it sucked up energy from the Lazar.</p><br/><p>\u2018The Soul Telautograph is ready.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was now time to prepare the next level.</p><br/><p>Preparing the material for the Soul Telautograph\u2019s target.</p><br/><p>Oteon looked at the unconscious man in the corner of the Arklateori.</p><br/><p>A normal human.</p><br/><p>A human who didn\u2019t have anything outstanding about him.</p><br/><p>That was why he was very important for this experiment.</p><br/><p>The procedure from the Soul Telautograph was something that needed to work with the majority as the target.</p><br/><p>Since there wouldn\u2019t be much meaning to it if it worked on a special target.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, they aren\u2019t really just ordinary.\u2019</p><br/><p>Oteon ground her teeth while she looked at the man on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is him right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, he is the one who got in while taking advantage of the situation where the Akadus had been destroyed and tried to mug us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFucking trash.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oteon mumbled quietly.</p><br/><p>\u2018The fact that this thing is of the same race as Hansoo is very shocking.\u2019</p><br/><p>Well, there wasn\u2019t anyone who would mourn this guy if he were to die.</p><br/><p>And because of this he was even more suited for this job.</p><br/><p>Oteon sat the man upon the Soul Telautograph.</p><br/><p>And the final step.</p><br/><p>\u201cAilen, give that thing to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>A orangish stone that was emitting light in Ailen\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>A gem that Elkadion had applied a few more layers on compared to the suppression stone.</p><br/><p>Oteon carefully shoved the gem inside the sitting man\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>Kududuk</p><br/><p>The gem got easily inserted into the pre-made hole in the man\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>Oteon then started the Soul Telautograph up the way Elkadion had taught her after finishing all the steps.</p><br/><p>Kururururu</p><br/><p>Soon the Soul Telautograph started up as red liquid started to get pulled into the man\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Ailen, who had been helping Oteon, mumbled as she looked at this scene.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Is this okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>To use a method that sacrificed others for strength.</p><br/><p>The Akarons had not created any methods or techniques that used sacrifices for strength before.</p><br/><p>Since it was something that went against their pride.</p><br/><p>Most of the Akarons\u2019 techniques were those that sacrificed themselves for more power.</p><br/><p>Though this man deserved death, if this experiment was to succeed then there was no guarantee that the ones undergoing this experiment would only be criminals.</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>Dududududu</p><br/><p>Arklateori\u2019s ceiling shook aggressively.</p><br/><p>As Oteon and Ailen looked at the ceiling in shock, the ceiling exploded out as something fell down.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026That is!\u2019</p><br/><p>Oteon shouted out in confusion as she saw the identity of the ones fighting.</p><br/><p>Why were they fighting?</p><br/><p>Elkadion crazily utilized the Dragon Essence Blade to stop Hansoo no matter what and shouted out loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cFinish the test no matter what!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Dragon Essence Blade with Taruhol\u2019s powerful body as the basis was rather formidable so much that even Hansoo who had the Forked Lightning and the Thousand Soldiers Armor could not handle it.</p><br/><p>Hansoo, who had been pushing Elkadion back by using the Pandemic Blade and Nurmaha\u2019s ring, shouted out aggressively.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop the procedure!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo didn\u2019t know whether it would succeed or fail.</p><br/><p>But it would be problematic no matter what happened.</p><br/><p>If it succeeded then Elkadion would be able to confirm her choice and try to perform the procedure at a much more intense rate.</p><br/><p>Oteon fell into a chaotic situation as she saw the two who were pushing each other back and shouting at her.</p><br/><p>\u2018Who should I listen to?\u2019</p><br/><p>The fact that one was human and the other was an Akaron wasn\u2019t important.</p><br/><p>Since the Akarons owed this two too much for such a thing to be important.</p><br/><p>The one who had allowed the Akarons to stand up on their feet by themselves.</p><br/><p>And the one who had pulled the Akarons out when they had been stuck in a hole of despair.</p><br/><p>Elkadion looked at Oteon and smiled.</p><br/><p>\u2018Isn\u2019t it obvious.\u2019</p><br/><p>She was working this hard for the Akarons.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo was in the end working for the humans.</p><br/><p>There was no way an alliance would come before one\u2019s own race.</p><br/><p>Oteon, who had been pondering, quickly made her decision.</p><br/><p>A bit different from Elkadion\u2019s expectation.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuuaaaaap!\u201d</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>Oteon shouted out as she smashed the Soul Telautograph.</p><br/><p>Elkadion made a sound that was almost a shout as she saw this.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Elkadion made an expression that was full of incomprehension and hurt while she stared at Oteon who was smashing the Soul Telautograph.</p><br/><p>Oteon following Hansoo\u2019s words hurt much more than the pain she received from getting beaten down by Hansoo.</p><br/><p>But Oteon hadn\u2019t smashed the machine because she thought that she needed to listen to Hansoo.</p><br/><p>There was a slightly different reason.</p><br/><p>\u2018I understand what has been bugging me this whole time now.\u2019</p><br/><p>And as she saw the two benefactors fight, she clearly realized which side she needed to take.</p><br/><p>Oteon clenched her teeth and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cO Elkadion! This is not the path for us Akarons!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elkadion mumbled with a dazed expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven with strength, it wouldn\u2019t be our race! Wake up! When did our race preserve our own bodies by sacrificing others and borrowing strength from others!\u201d</p><br/><p>Oteon crazily smashed the Soul Telautograph apart.</p><br/><p>If they lose their pride then they wouldn\u2019t be the Akarons anymore.</p><br/><p>Power and intelligence wasn\u2019t the thing that discerned whether one was a human or a Margoth or an Akaron.</p><br/><p>Their rules and the pride that sprouted from those rules made them into the Akarons.</p><br/><p>Elkadion flinched just as she was about to attack Oteon.</p><br/><p>And during that short moment.</p><br/><p>Booooom!</p><br/><p>The Soul Telautograph made a huge noise and blew apart from Oteon\u2019s final attack.</p><br/><p>Elkadion, who had been fighting with Hansoo, made a dull expression. The fact that she had been denied by her comrade and betrayed by her race bored into Elkadion.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026I did all this for your future.\u2019</p><br/><p>And the final words of Oteon had hurt Elkadion too much.</p><br/><p>\u2018Did I get twisted towards a wrong direction instead of improving in the Abyss?\u2019</p><br/><p>Elkadion shook her head while making a bitter expression.</p><br/><p>\u2018No, I can\u2019t be sure whether it was a failure or not.\u2019</p><br/><p>Though she couldn\u2019t make another Soul Telautograph, there were still many left.</p><br/><p>If she were to show a good result during the next test than the thoughts of Hansoo or the Akarons may change.</p><br/><p>\u2018If using the the body of a human is an issue than I can find another method.\u2019</p><br/><p>The important factor was the strength of the souls those races had.</p><br/><p>Hansoo smashed Elkadion again.</p><br/><p>Since he knew that Elkadion hadn\u2019t given up.</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>\u2018End it all here.\u2019</p><br/><p>He needed to pull the Dragon Essence Blade out from within the body.</p><br/><p>Kududududk</p><br/><p>Soon a battle of strength occurred between Hansoo and Elkadion.</p><br/><p>During the time when the two held each other\u2019s hand as they were trying to push each other down.</p><br/><p>Koooooong</p><br/><p>A dark aura permeated out from somewhere.</p><br/><p>Hansoo frowned during the fight from the strange aura that had suddenly spread out.</p><br/><p>And Elkadion\u2019s expression brightened up.</p><br/><p>\u2018It succeeded!\u2019</p><br/><p>If she could show that she could control this then persuading the others would become very easy.</p><br/><p>Koooooong</p><br/><p>Something pushed through the debris of the Soul Telautograph and walked out.</p><br/><p>And Elkadion looked at the man who had walked out from with an expression of hope.</p><br/><p>Then aggressively pushed Hansoo away.</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>Elkadion quickly got up after pushing Hansoo away and approached the man.</p><br/><p>A rather formidable aura permeated out from the man who was surrounded by a dark aura.</p><br/><p>The man didn\u2019t budge a single muscle despite Elkadion having approached him and instead stared at her.</p><br/><p>Swoosh</p><br/><p>Elkadion stood next to the man and then spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cLower your head and kneel in front of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Swoosh</p><br/><p>The man listened to Elkadion\u2019s words without hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u2018Did it succeed?\u2019</p><br/><p>Oteon, who had been making a very worried expression, felt at ease for now.</p><br/><p>Since it would be hard to control that person who was radiating such a fierce aura.</p><br/><p>\u2018Anyways, she should be in a good mood. Since the experiment succeeded.\u2019</p><br/><p>While Oteon was looking at Elkadion, Elkadion looked at Hansoo after making the man kneel.</p><br/><p>And then shouted out loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHansoo! I beg of you, please!\u201d</p><br/><p>She then smashed the head of the man kneeling in front of her.</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>\u201cUh? What is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Oteon was shocked as she saw this scene.</p><br/><p>Why did she suddenly hit the head of the soldier who was listening to her obediently?</p><br/><p>And what was she begging him for?</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>Whooosh</p><br/><p>Oteon and AIlen freaked out at the sudden hands of somebody who had grasped their waists and was quickly carrying them away.</p><br/><p>\u201cHansoo! What are you doing right now! What\u2019s going on!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo frowned at those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you on the way. We need to prepare while she buys time for us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo made an annoyed expression at the tremendously formidable aura, which couldn\u2019t even be compared to that from before, which had exploded out from behind them.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething that shouldn\u2019t have crawled out actually crawled out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this. How did you find out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kudududududk</p><br/><p>The man looked at Elkadion with a strange expression after having attacked her.</p><br/><p>While grasping tightly onto Elkadion\u2019s hand that had smashed into his head.</p><br/><p>Kudududk</p><br/><p>The hands of a normal adventurer was causing the Dragon Essence Blade around Elkadion\u2019s fist to crack.</p><br/><p>Elkadion clenched her teeth.</p><br/><p>A normal resident of the Otherworld might\u2019ve not known but Hansoo and her were people who once roamed the Abyss.</p><br/><p>How would they not notice that this guy was acting?</p><br/><p>Elkadion thought of the dialog they had with the Akaron\u2019s special communication when they held hands earlier.</p><br/><p>She would block him here and Hansoo would go and prepare.</p><br/><p>\u2018I will risk my life to stop him here. Please hurry up. After everything ends\u2026 And if we\u2019re alive then I will give you my sincerest apology. About my arrogance.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cUuaaaap!\u201d</p><br/><p>Booooom!</p><br/><p>Elkadion clenched her teeth and attacked the man in front of her.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

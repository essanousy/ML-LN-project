I don\u2019t know if it will work out well.\u2019</p><br/><p>He had spilled the milk but where was a problem.</p><br/><p>The situation where Hansoo beats down everyone including the sixty over there and the seven of them.</p><br/><p>Then he would have basically poked the beast that was sleeping soundly.</p><br/><p>It could become a situation where he stole the sleeping lion\u2019s food bowl.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well whatever. Since nobody knows that it was me who did it.\u2019</p><br/><p>Since he spilled it very softly while beating up a guy who had charged at him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yea. I could just fake it and pretend I don\u2019t know.\u2019</p><br/><p>Who would know that he did it?</p><br/><p>Taesoon calmed down and stared at Hansoo who was walking from afar.</p><br/><p>And Mihee ran towards Hansoo first as he returned.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re back! But there\u2019s a problem! The guys over there took everything from the store!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo chuckled at those words and patted Mihee\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know. I saw as I came up. Did you gather the food for us?\u201d</p><br/><p>At those words Mihee looked back and mumbled.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe did but\u2026 there isn\u2019t much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since they prepared anticipating they would bring more from the store they didn\u2019t have a lot of food or equipment.</p><br/><p>Since there was a limit to the size of the backpack.</p><br/><p>And even more so since they gathered up female supplies and weapons.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo didn\u2019t add anything extra.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell that could happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>And then Hansoo started looked around to everyone.</p><br/><p>And his eyes stopped at Taesoon.</p><br/><p>Taesoon replied as if nothing happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s good since you\u2019re here we can just take it back from them. It would be hard by yourself but if we go together and force them they would give it back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo chuckled.</p><br/><p>\u2018Aigoo. This guy.\u2019</p><br/><p>But Hansoo didn\u2019t really say much.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell. Let\u2019s eat first.\u201d</p><br/><p>At Hansoo\u2019s words, Mihee, Jisun, Gangtae went up to the food they had collected.</p><br/><p>Since it was set up in a half broken down cafe there were a lot of tables and it wasn\u2019t comfortable to eat.</p><br/><p>And soon the table was filled with canned foods and other edibles.</p><br/><p>As Hansoo walked towards it slowly Taesoon threw out something jokingly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI mean we got these risking our lives, shouldn\u2019t you eat after paying us something?\u201d</p><br/><p>And then the cafe turned silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey. Why are you being like this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Mihee glanced at Taesoon then talked back.</p><br/><p>But Taesoon had no plans to back down.</p><br/><p>\u2018I can\u2019t keep getting dragged around here.\u2019</p><br/><p>And he didn\u2019t really say anything wrong.</p><br/><p>Hansoo left the food he would eat at the store but if they didn\u2019t bring it then it would\u2019ve been taken by the gang over there.</p><br/><p>In conclusion this was theirs.</p><br/><p>And they had brought it with risk but despite him being Hansoo, shouldn\u2019t he pay something up for it?</p><br/><p>And as Hansoo made an amused expression and stayed silent, the nearby friends were in quite a turmoil.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey if it wasn\u2019t for Hansoo we don\u2019t know where we could be right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Taesoon replied to Mihee.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Hansoo told us before also. Liking free things is dangerous. We need to keep it in check here in order to stay together.\u201d</p><br/><p>And at those words Sangjin nodded at the back.</p><br/><p>It seemed he had some pent up dissatisfaction from the payments for the poison and the skills.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really have something to give for the food here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Taesoon spat out something instinctively at Hansoo\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy not. You have that thing you earned in there, we could use it together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>The four who didn\u2019t know the situation made a confused expression as Taesoon laughed and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat guy. He went into an empty space alone. He probably got something from there. If we use that together our survival rates will increase. Let\u2019s share it. We need to act together anyway. Don\u2019t do such a trade like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>At those words everyone looked at Hansoo.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t say anything but with the eyes asking why.</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked at those eyes and chuckled.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve learnt well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026what do you mean learn. You talk in an unpleasant way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo clicked his tongue inwardly at that Taesoon.</p><br/><p>He did learn but he learnt it in a flimsy way.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well. Since he probably thinks are we\u2019re equal because we\u2019re friends then that should be normal.\u2019</p><br/><p>Basically if one thinks that they\u2019re under then they can\u2019t come out like that but if they think that they\u2019re on equal grounds then its obvious that they would come out like that.</p><br/><p>But the problem isn\u2019t that.</p><br/><p>Hansoo who had organized his thoughts for a moment landed a decision.</p><br/><p>\u2018I guess it ends here.\u2019</p><br/><p>Why would Hansoo carry these guys around?</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t really care for receiving runes.</p><br/><p>If he killed a few more then they would come out so why would be rather receive them.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t a game, a time where he went was long gone.</p><br/><p>Since he had fought too long to do that.</p><br/><p>The only reason why he was keeping them was because of what Eres had said.</p><br/><p>The reason why he asked for runes is because without doing that then they will make more and more requests that go too far.</p><br/><p>\u2018Eres, I\u2019ve done all I can.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo shrugged his shoulders and stood up.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t a stingy person, he wasn\u2019t going to go or something.</p><br/><p>\u2018How did Kangtae manage to say things like this. It\u2019s extremely embarrassing.\u2019</p><br/><p>Well these guys aren\u2019t really enemies, if they separate then that\u2019s the end of it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell. It\u2019s ok. Stay well. Be strong from now on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was startled at Hansoo\u2019s words as he got up.</p><br/><p>They knew that it would become instantaneously hard without Hansoo.</p><br/><p>He only wanted to set the mood not make him leave.</p><br/><p>And only then they started to make Taesoon stop.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you being like this? Don\u2019t fight.\u201d</p><br/><p>The friends were talking around him but Taesoon landed a decision.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yeah, get lost.\u2019</p><br/><p>They were seven. If they act the way he taught them then they could safely gather a lot of runes fast without moving around dangerously like him.</p><br/><p>No, even if he got weaker he didn\u2019t like the fact that somebody was above him.</p><br/><p>And that attitude.</p><br/><p>It was an attitude that showed someone like himself was not even necessary.</p><br/><p>That really pissed him off.</p><br/><p>\u2018Motherfucker\u2019</p><br/><p>As Taesoon saw Mihee slowly walk towards Hansoo, he got even angrier and then spat out.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo if you want to go. Principles and principles. If we really give this out for free there will be no end. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re thinking but we don\u2019t need him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then there was somebody who followed his footsteps.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Jin Mihee! Are you really going? And leaving us behind?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mihee clenched her teeth at Taesoon\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u2018I must live.\u2019</p><br/><p>The reason why the others didn\u2019t move because they didn\u2019t see Hansoo fighting below.</p><br/><p>Mihee, who had seen that, knew instantly who was safer to go with.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going with Hansoo. Can you take me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then Hansoo shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>But Hansoo added at Mihee who was in despair.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I can\u2019t really say anything about you following me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPhew.\u201d</p><br/><p>Taesoon talked coldly at Mihee who was sighing from relief.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t go. You didn\u2019t pay back the rune. To Sangjin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mihee can\u2019t leave.</p><br/><p>Since she has a precious skill.</p><br/><p>And if she has a debt she can\u2019t leave like that.</p><br/><p>\u2018And\u2026 where will I send you.\u2019</p><br/><p>A girl that he had eyes upon since admission.</p><br/><p>A situation like this was a great chance.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>And then Mihee made a sad noise as she thought of borrowing runes from Sangjin.</p><br/><p>Then Sangjin shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ok. I\u2019m following too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>At those words Taesoon clenched his teeth.</p><br/><p>\u2018This guy who was always behind me\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>That guy\u2019s dad works at his dad\u2019s company.</p><br/><p>And that was the reason why he couldn\u2019t leave so far.</p><br/><p>He had used him well so far but to suddenly come out like this.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yeah. Get lost, you have nothing to do with me now huh?</p><br/><p>Taesoon spat out while clenching his teeth.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Get lost then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The four who were looking at the bickering between Sangjin, Mihee, Hansoo and Taesoon seemed to be in a turmoil but then decided to stay next to Taesoon and moved next to him.</p><br/><p>Since they didn\u2019t feel right about leaving and since all the food was here.</p><br/><p>Taesoon looked at the three leaving, clenched his teeth but then shook his head instead.</p><br/><p>\u2018No, it turned out for the better\u2019</p><br/><p>Now the leadership position has came back to him.</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t at the level of Mihee but the three girls here were pretty high quality and there was nobody stronger than him.</p><br/><p>For hunts he could just watch Hansoo to somewhat figure out the weaknesses and then go hunt somewhere else.</p><br/><p>And all the food was here too.</p><br/><p>As long as there aren\u2019t any more problems then there weren\u2019t going to be situations where their lives would be in danger.</p><br/><p>\u2018After I get strong enough, I can slowly make my way through.\u2019</p><br/><p>Taesoon breathed in and out then laughed as he saw the friends who were looking at his back and not Hansoo\u2019s.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Sangjin looked at Hansoo with a dissatisfied expression and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t really have to do anything? All the food is with them.\u201d</p><br/><p>At Sangjin\u2019s words there was some resentment.</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s Hansoo then he could probably take it all back.</p><br/><p>And he stuck with Hansoo because he thought he would do that.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo did not carry anything out.</p><br/><p>\u2018What are his thoughts exactly?\u2019</p><br/><p>Sangjin did not understand Hansoo.</p><br/><p>Since he didn\u2019t bring out any food.</p><br/><p>He had the strength to do whatever he felt but why was he like that.</p><br/><p>Hansoo chuckled at those words.</p><br/><p>Since he could tell what he was thinking.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well. If they don\u2019t know about the moon\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>The food they have is useless food already.</p><br/><p>Why would he bicker around regarding things that were already useless.</p><br/><p>\u2018It seems it\u2019s almost midnight\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked at the sky.</p><br/><p>At the sudden action, Sangjin and Mihee also looked at the sky.</p><br/><p>In the middle of the dark sky there was a single round moon floating.</p><br/><p>An extremely normal full moon.</p><br/><p>And then something weird came into Mihee\u2019s sight</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026Did I see wrong?\u2019</p><br/><p>Mihee made a slit with her eyes and looked at the moon.</p><br/><p>\u2018It was like something flickered on the moon.\u2019</p><br/><p>Mihee, who had been looking at the moon, suddenly got the chills all over her body and almost felt bad.</p><br/><p>Blink</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026 The moon blinked its eyes.\u2019</p><br/><p>The surface of the moon split open with a crack and then a frightening eye appeared.</p><br/><p>The iris on the center of the eye moved back and forth without stopping as it scanned every living organism around.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cSince everyone\u2019s left, let\u2019s just eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Taesoon said energetically as he walked towards the table.</p><br/><p>Jisun looked at Taesoon with a slightly anxious look.</p><br/><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we..at least make up? I think we need Hansoo.\u201d</p><br/><p>At those words, flames rose up from within Taesoon.</p><br/><p>\u2018That bitch has already gotten lost! Why are you looking for that bitch!\u2019</p><br/><p>But Taesoon managed to laugh on the surface.</p><br/><p>His situation wasn\u2019t quite well set yet.</p><br/><p>If he makes a mistake then they could all leave to Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. Look at that guy. He has something he had but he\u2019s using it alone. He\u2019s a guy that would only make trouble if he stayed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cmmm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Honestly Jisun didn\u2019t like that either.</p><br/><p>If there was something good then it won\u2019t even be enough to use it together but to leave just like that.</p><br/><p>And Taesoon who had seen Jisun\u2019s expression, added strength to his voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd all the food is here too. If they\u2019re hungry they\u2019ll come back. Won\u2019t they listen better then?\u201d</p><br/><p>And then Taesoon started to take out the food from the bag.</p><br/><p>And at that moment something happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>A strand of moonlight came into the room.</p><br/><p>As if the light bended.</p><br/><p>And as if it was searching for something, searching every corner.</p><br/><p>And at the snake-like light that entered the room, the food that had been shone upon started to burn.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is going on\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Taesoon rushed and checked the rest of the food.</p><br/><p>But the food that was stacked was all burnt down without anything remaining.</p><br/><p>\u201cGoddamit! How did this happen!\u201d</p><br/><p>Taesoon and the remaining four cried out in shock from the strange phenomena that melted down all the food in the interval of a few seconds.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

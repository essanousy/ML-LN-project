Even if I did go in, I might\u2019ve been cut.\u2019</p><br/><p>500 was that low of a number.</p><br/><p>But in such a case, something bad would happen.</p><br/><p>There was no way they would leave a spot for the non-clansmen to ascend.</p><br/><p>Since they\u2019ll be too busy trying to take all of their people.</p><br/><p>It seemed like the other non-clansmen who were quick to catch on had realized this already as they mumbled about.</p><br/><p>They had three paths they could choose from in that case.</p><br/><p>Exclude the clansmen and head towards the Demon Lord\u2019s Castle with non-clansmen.</p><br/><p>Form an alliance between the non-clansmen and fight the clan for the spot of 500.</p><br/><p>And final choice.</p><br/><p>Stay with the clans to fight and hopefully wait for the empty spot that may come their way.</p><br/><p>\u2018Goddamit.\u2019</p><br/><p>Sangtae shook his head.</p><br/><p>In reality the two options above were basically impossible.</p><br/><p>The non-clansmen adventurers had long been ripped apart by the clans.</p><br/><p>The two options above were only possible when they form an alliance and agree with each other to create a clan vs non-clan composition.</p><br/><p>But if they only had the choice of choosing from the two above then they would\u2019ve gathered their strength in some way.</p><br/><p>Since they couldn\u2019t just sit and die.</p><br/><p>The damnable fact was that hope still existed.</p><br/><p>\u2018The third option is the problem.\u2019</p><br/><p>If they continue to defend then the number of clansmen will go down.</p><br/><p>But those guys probably want to fill up 500 completely to ascend.</p><br/><p>Since it was better the more you had if you thought of the place above.</p><br/><p>Which meant, there will be space where non-clansmen would be able to come into.</p><br/><p>A much higher chance than the first two which had the chance of a complete massacre.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn.. can\u2019t really do anything then.\u2019</p><br/><p>If this happened then as long as they don\u2019t think of getting all the non-clansmen to have a fight, they could only get on the good side of the clan unions.</p><br/><p>It might be barely possible if the 700 remaining people gathered their strengths but if they were split like this then they had no choice.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fuck\u2026As long as we group up then we might be able to do something.\u2019</p><br/><p>Actually the main point of this game was very simple.</p><br/><p>If they split their power then both sides die.</p><br/><p>So everyone had to choose one side.</p><br/><p>Either to defend or to attack.</p><br/><p>But if one side advocates strongly then the other side could only obediently follow unless they were determined to have a battle royale.</p><br/><p>So there was no way for the non-clan powers to win.</p><br/><p>Since the clan unions were unified in thought whilst the adventurers of non-clan powers were split up all around.</p><br/><p>And even if they were to emphasize that it was more beneficial for the clan unions, they could only get pushed around whilst holding onto a dim thread of hope.</p><br/><p>Sangtae shouted loudly after pondering.</p><br/><p>\u2018This can\u2019t go on like this.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Is there nobody to go with me! Damnit! You know what will happen if you stay here!\u201d</p><br/><p>A few non-clansmen fliched at these words but nobody had walked out on their own.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damnit\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>But while the Clan Lords were looking at Sangtae with ridicule, one person came out from the crowd and walked up next to Sangtae.</p><br/><p>And Sangtae frowned as he saw this.</p><br/><p>Since a person that was totally out of the expectation had walked out.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you all so surprised?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo, who had walked out into the eyes of the people, shrugged his shoulders as he looked at them.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026.if you stay here then you will definitely be part of the 500 though.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo chuckled at Sangtae\u2019s words as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell. There\u2019s always personal circumstances. I\u2019m going to the Demon Lord\u2019s Castle.\u201d</p><br/><p>And then one of the non-clansmen shouted with hope.</p><br/><p>Everyone knew.</p><br/><p>That Hansoo had a strange psychic power.</p><br/><p>\u2018Did he perhaps\u2026 choose to go to the Demon Lord\u2019s Castle because he knows something?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we follow you, will it be safe?\u201d</p><br/><p>The reason why their ankles were caught was because they could not even imagine how dangerous the road to the Demon Lord\u2019s castle would be.</p><br/><p>Since if there was a confirmation for such a thing, there was no reason to stay around here.</p><br/><p>Hansoo shrugged his shoulders at those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. The same amount of 500 might survive if we go there, or maybe even less\u201d</p><br/><p>Will more survive if they all combined their strength to head towards the Demon Lord\u2019s Castle?</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t even know this.</p><br/><p>Since there are too many factors.</p><br/><p>But he knew one thing for certain.</p><br/><p>If they stay here then no more than 500 can survive.</p><br/><p>If 600 were to survive in the end, will the remaining 100 peacefully die?</p><br/><p>Of course there will inevitably be a collision and the others who aren\u2019t part of the 500 will die.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Eres had managed to ascend with 600 people out of 1000 after choosing to go to the Demon Lord\u2019s Castle.</p><br/><p>Hansoo chuckled as he saw the dejected looks on the people as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut if you aren\u2019t part of a clan it\u2019s better to go. If you stay here then the ones taking the risk are you so why would you try to stay here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even if they were die off the same way, it was a problem of ratio in the end.</p><br/><p>Even if the same amount of people die on the way as they would if they defended, once they arrive there then they can ascend together.</p><br/><p>But on the other hand, if they were stay and defend and succeed the non-clansmen who aren\u2019t chosen by the clansmen would all die.</p><br/><p>At those words, the expressions of everybody who had been pondering this turned fierce as the mumbling got louder.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going.\u201d</p><br/><p>Taehee questioned Hyunwoo\u2019s words which he spoke out after hearing the story.</p><br/><p>The Hyunwoo she knew was a safety-first believer.</p><br/><p>But then he was risking on such a dangerous looking gamble.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hyunwoo smirked as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something I had found out about him separately.\u201d</p><br/><p>There once was a movement that went around in order to collect intel about Hansoo.</p><br/><p>And as such movements occurred, Hyunwoo became curious as well.</p><br/><p>No, this was not only Hyunwoo\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>Everyone was curious about that guy fighting there.</p><br/><p>Since it was weirder to be not curious about that guy who was so eye catching.</p><br/><p>And so the rumors of rumors and opinions of opinions combined.</p><br/><p>It started from the people who had been with Hansoo since the 1st tutorial area and went up to the people who had seen Hansoo so far where the intel grouped up and got organized.</p><br/><p>And the conclusion that came from it.</p><br/><p>\u2018He can be trusted.\u2019</p><br/><p>Surprisingly they said he was strong from the start.</p><br/><p>There were plenty of ways to take advantage of others in the beginning.</p><br/><p>He could kill people to pull runes.</p><br/><p>Or he could hunt and steal all the runes by suppressing others with his strength.</p><br/><p>But he wasn\u2019t like that.</p><br/><p>No, he was actually extremely thorough in distribution.</p><br/><p>He had eaten things to the point where it was close to monopolization but as they heard, he only fought in dangerous places.</p><br/><p>Which was the same if you looked at him fighting the demons right now.</p><br/><p>\u2018And I like the fact that he doesn\u2019t get swept around by useless emotions the most.\u2019</p><br/><p>One of the things he hated the most were people who wanted to get carried around.</p><br/><p>But as they heard, if they couldn\u2019t pay up for their own worth then he did not care about them.</p><br/><p>Of course they couldn\u2019t confirm just by piecing together rumors.</p><br/><p>There was just one important fact.</p><br/><p>That others were probably thinking the same way as him.</p><br/><p>\u2018The chance has come.\u2019</p><br/><p>It has been a while since the rumor of him being rather trustable had been going around.</p><br/><p>Since he proved it with his actions rather than words.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t neglect in hunting down the undead while taking down Demons.</p><br/><p>And because of that he was worth having as the center.</p><br/><p>And they had to group up in order to break the game where the clans were the center.</p><br/><p>If they go on with the current situation, the clans won\u2019t have to take any risks while they had to shoulder all of the risk.</p><br/><p>The non-clansmen adventurers would die off in piles even if they chose to defend.</p><br/><p>And the ones who couldn\u2019t get into clans would be thrown off in the end.</p><br/><p>Hyunwoo shouted loudly as he walked towards Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m following!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>And then Hyunwoo discreetly poked Taehee.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey. You follow too while shouting loudly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Taehee chuckled as she shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going too! Dick-like clan bastards!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026you don\u2019t have to go that far. Why is this girl\u2019s mouth so dirty?\u2019</p><br/><p>Well whatever happened, as the two walked out straightforwardly as they shouted, mumbles were heard from all around then curses were heard as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cEyy. Bitches. Being bossed around is annoying!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going too! Fuck! There\u2019s no way that the fairy would have set it so only one of attack or defense would be easy!\u201d</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t heading out because they were just pissed.</p><br/><p>Since it was an important judgment where their lives were at stake.</p><br/><p>But if they carried on like this then the situation will flow the way the clans wanted after they swing back and forth under the clan\u2019s dominion.</p><br/><p>They were confident that this was more dangerous than going to the Demon Lord\u2019s Castle.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis crazy\u2026you can\u2019t move! It\u2019s not child\u2019s play, why would you move at such incitements\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>While a clansmen got flustered and tried to stop them after seeing everyone moving and mumbling, something ruthlessly flew down and embedded itself from the sky.</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>\u201cHuuuuurrk!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you blocking them when they\u2019re saying they\u2019ll go on their own feet. Leave them be.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo smirked as he spoke.</p><br/><p>The Clan Lords turned gloomy as they saw the giant chain sickle which had flown from Hansoo and landed in front of the clansmen\u2019s foot.</p><br/><p>It was a weapon Hansoo brought back one day whilst fighting the Demons.</p><br/><p>They had known what this was.</p><br/><p>Since it was on the catalogue.</p><br/><p>Cost.</p><br/><p>60 crystals.</p><br/><p>An armament that couldn\u2019t even be compared to which costs 15.</p><br/><p>From the beginning the fairies probably didn\u2019t expect that someone who would buy such a thing would come out .</p><br/><p>Since they probably didn\u2019t think that there could be a guy who could monopolize all the Demons that came out.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys over there should think about it again? Since a man\u2019s thoughts can change.\u201d</p><br/><p>Guktae clenched his teeth as he looked at Hansoo who was talking to them whilst retrieving the chains.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damnit\u2026 He\u2019s the problem again.\u2019</p><br/><p>The thing that made so many people move was not the words that Hansoo had spoken.</p><br/><p>The core point was the actions and the power that grinded the Demons which Hansoo had shown while defending.</p><br/><p>He might\u2019ve been less annoyed if they struggled to form a non-clansmen union but the fact that this had happened because a guy who didn\u2019t do anything and only hunted stepped out and spoke a few words annoyed him even more.</p><br/><p>Because the effort in which they put in to gather people and have a power struggle felt like it was being mocked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damnable bastard.\u2019</p><br/><p>Guktae was locked in worry as he looked at the 200 non-clansmen who were running behind Hansoo and were increasing rapidly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do I need to pull out the special forces?\u2019</p><br/><p>Guktae pondered if he should forcibly shut this situation down with the hidden piece that he had prepared for a moment but he shook his head instead.</p><br/><p>If they were to collide in this situation, it would be a battle royale.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ll follow your orders for now.\u2019</p><br/><p>Guktae started to quickly converse with the other Clan Lords.</p><br/><p>Proofreader\u2019s Note</p><br/><p>Damn no info on Hansoo\u2019s new shiny equipment\ud83d\ude26</p><br/><p>KobatoChan\u2019s Note</p><br/><p>Hmm, you will discover it soon.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

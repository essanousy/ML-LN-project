Stupid bastards.\u2019</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t in the position to say this but that was the truth.</p><br/><p>Hadn\u2019t him, who didn\u2019t know about the farm at all, stayed alive?</p><br/><p>The ones who were excessive had been killed but it didn\u2019t seem like they had yet decided how to deal with him and the others like him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Then there\u2019s a bit of hope.\u2019</p><br/><p>Though the lives of his comrades had been taken, Karhal didn\u2019t really make a nervous expression at all.</p><br/><p>Since it wasn\u2019t the end yet.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey come on. Hear me out for a second.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mackill moved the sword to Karhal\u2019s neck after seeing him speaking out in such a laid back manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hear out your last words at least.\u201d</p><br/><p>Karhal, who had been beaten down to a mess, voiced his thoughts with a serious expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cDecide what to do after hearing me out. What are you guys going to do now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone stopped at those words.</p><br/><p>Since they hadn\u2019t thought this far due to having been extremely enraged from the previous event.</p><br/><p>Akilen spoke with an agitated expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat damn village\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>But Karhal cut her off.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you going to leave the village once and for all? And what about you Hansoo? Are you going to get through the Green Road with these guys?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Farmers flinched at Karhal\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Green Road.</p><br/><p>A road filled with rank 1 and 2 beasts that threatened the village.</p><br/><p>Going through this road with their current abilities was suicide.</p><br/><p>Karhal spoke with a heavy expression while looking at the Farmers.</p><br/><p>Since there was no need to agitate them further by making fun of them.</p><br/><p>His life was still in their hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe village is a place where people like you are needed. How long do you think you can survive without the village? The village asked you before we brought you in. As to whether you can sacrifice a bit of humanness for survival. Did it bring you in forcibly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone frowned but didn\u2019t rebuke those words.</p><br/><p>Since they weren\u2019t wrong.</p><br/><p>Karhal continued to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cBasically, you guys have just blatantly broken the rules of the village. We didn\u2019t do well in our position but at least we\u2019re useful. What are you going to go do at the village? Kill everyone of us who went into the forbidden area to torment you? Do you have any idea how chaotic the 1st Area would become without us and how many Farmers would die because of that? Are you going to defend against all those beasts by yourself?\u201d</p><br/><p>Karhal then looked at the black marble in Hansoo\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>It sealed mana.</p><br/><p>A very threatening effect.</p><br/><p>But it was useless against the beasts.</p><br/><p>Since a beast would just shred them apart with their physical abilities alone.</p><br/><p>Though Hansoo might be able to win against them, he wouldn\u2019t be able to hunt better than them.</p><br/><p>Karhal spoke as he looked at the Farmers who were getting more and more nervous.</p><br/><p>This was the last chance.</p><br/><p>He needed to stay calm.</p><br/><p>Karhal calmly spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just drop it here. If you guys return to the village separate from us then it\u2019ll be solved. If we blame everything to the dead then it would end very quietly. Perfect right? Nothing happened today. Oh wait! Something did happen. Since we cleared the maniacs of the 1st Area and saved you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mackill frowned as she spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can we trust you? What if you do something to us after you get to the village?\u201d</p><br/><p>Karhal chuckled at Mackill\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you holding onto our weakness? You just need to tell everything to Enkidu if something goes wrong. We wouldn\u2019t die but\u2026 A 1st or 2nd ranking beast will still be hard for us to fight. There\u2019s no reason we would risk going through that just to piss you off a bit more. We Hunters of the 1st Area and will be leaving in just a few months, there\u2019s no reason to worsen the situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamnit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mackill frowned as she spat out those words.</p><br/><p>Since those words were right despite making her annoyed.</p><br/><p>The Hunters wouldn\u2019t die from them telling everything to Ekidu.</p><br/><p>Since the village wouldn\u2019t dare kill the remaining 1st Area\u2019s Hunters.</p><br/><p>No, there\u2019ll be less restrictions on the ones who are in charge of the 1st Area.</p><br/><p>Since the problem will get worse if they killed all the people in charge of the 1st Area.</p><br/><p>But this was why it was a safe situation for both parties.</p><br/><p>If the Hunters would die from the Farmers telling on them then they would do everything in their power to get rid of the Farmers who would be a danger to them after getting to the village.</p><br/><p>Mackill took a glance at Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do we do\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo shrugged and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you asking me that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of authority do I have to decide that? It\u2019s all in your hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had accomplished his objective.</p><br/><p>And the ones who suffered were Mackill and her group.</p><br/><p>If the Farmers could forgive the Hunters then it\u2019ll end with that but if they couldn\u2019t then the Hunters would just all die.</p><br/><p>Since there wasn\u2019t a set guideline for a suitable retribution.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Phew.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mackill turned around to hear out the opinions of others.</p><br/><p>\u2018Though the answer is predestined already.\u2019</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a bad offer.</p><br/><p>They had already killed the ones who they really wanted to kill anyway.</p><br/><p>And as she expected, the people were making nervous expressions while nodding.</p><br/><p>Since they didn\u2019t really have another method to solve this.</p><br/><p>Karhal laughed as he looked at Mackill.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen release the mana suppression please. We\u2019re on one side now right? You can just suppress us right away if you wanted to anyway.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mackill sighed deeply and then nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. Hansoo. Could you please?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo then turned off the black jade in his hands.</p><br/><p>Kiiiiiiiiing</p><br/><p>The jade stopped right away.</p><br/><p>At the same time the mana in their bodies that refused to even budge slightly started to move.</p><br/><p>\u2018I still can\u2019t use it however I want. There are some set rules.\u2019</p><br/><p>At the very least, he couldn\u2019t turn the surrounding area into a vacuum of mana as he wanted.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026I should use it when the Harvester comes.\u2019</p><br/><p>He knew that he should not use this until then.</p><br/><p>While Hansoo was inspecting the black jade.</p><br/><p>Karhal made a content expression from the mana refilling in his body and then stood up from his spot.</p><br/><p>Along with the other Hunters.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn. Was this really the right choice?\u2019</p><br/><p>An aura that theirs couldn\u2019t even compare to.</p><br/><p>As the farmers were feeling nervous while looking at those Hunters, Karhal looked at the other Hunters behind him and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. Since we have thirty people\u2026 Take 7 each.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Take what?\u201d</p><br/><p>At Mackill\u2019s question, who was feeling a bit nervous from their powers she had seen earlier, Karhal just smiled as he replied:</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? Since we\u2019re comrades we\u2019ll take you up there on our backs. It\u2019ll be a bit hard on your own.\u201d</p><br/><p>Karhal then pointed towards the top of this darkness.</p><br/><p>It was a height that Mackill and the Farmers wouldn\u2019t even dare to climb.</p><br/><p>But if Karhal and the others helped them a bit with their skills from behind them it\u2019ll be very easy.</p><br/><p>\u2018Phew. The position of force has been switched over completely.\u2019</p><br/><p>But this was still okay.</p><br/><p>While Mackill was shaking her head and preparing to go up.</p><br/><p>Hansoo spoke towards Karhal who was feeling quite leisurely.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait. We didn\u2019t finish yet. Since you finished speaking to them, you should talk a bit with me too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Mmm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Karhal looked at Hansoo with a heavy expression.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yeah. Releasing a caught fish\u2026He shouldn\u2019t let us go for free.\u2019</p><br/><p>He had forgotten about the most threatening person here while dealing with the angered Farmers.</p><br/><p>Even if the Farmers decided to let them go, if this guy wanted to kill them all then it would be a piece of cake.</p><br/><p>\u2018That damned marble.\u2019</p><br/><p>Karhal\u2019s leisurely expression disappeared and was replaced with an extremely pressured expression.</p><br/><p>If Hansoo decided to kill them all?</p><br/><p>There was no reason to test anything out.</p><br/><p>The 200 Farmers and 30 Hunters here would just all disappear.</p><br/><p>They would all get smashed apart by that guy\u2019s stupidly powerful body.</p><br/><p>He would then just eat up their runes and continue.</p><br/><p>He wouldn\u2019t be able to remain in the village with that but why would he want to stay there anyway?</p><br/><p>Someone at his level could just go through the Green Road with ease.</p><br/><p>\u2018It seems he has some other thoughts since he hasn\u2019t done that yet\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo didn\u2019t seem impulsive but this was definitely not a pushover.</p><br/><p>And he had nothing to lose either.</p><br/><p>He might ask for something large.</p><br/><p>Hansoo spoke towards Karhal who had prepared himself mentally.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Oh my. Something like this really happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ekidu frowned as she listened to the stories of the Hunters and the Farmers who had returned.</p><br/><p>For the Farmers who were suspected of being killed by the beasts or having gone missing to be trapped in the 1st Area.</p><br/><p>Karim, the leader of the guards, nodded as he looked at Ekidu.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems the remaining 1st Area Hunters have brought them. Anyways, are you going to just let this slide? Not being able to regulate one\u2019s team properly is also a crime.\u201d</p><br/><p>Enkidu looked at Karim with a heavy expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have a fault as well for not being able to find something like this out. And since most came back alive\u2026 Let\u2019s just leave it at that. Oh and watch over them strictly. They might\u2019ve closed up their mouths due to threats.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><br/><p>Karim nodded.</p><br/><p>Since the current situation wasn\u2019t one where he should be wasting time on things like this.</p><br/><p>The Human Farm event was pretty important but a bigger problem had come up to their front door.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tsk.\u2019</p><br/><p>Karim finished her thoughts and then looked towards the distance, past Ekidu\u2019s residence.</p><br/><p>Towards the territory of the Higher race past the ceasefire village.</p><br/><p>\u2018Dakidus\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Karim mumbled quietly and spoke to Ekidu.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have to start now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026.Damn.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ekidu clenched her teeth at those words.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t much time until the Harvester of Arukon, the giant Beastmen race, Dakidus arrived.</p><br/><p>They needed to pick out the offerings before then.</p><br/><p>With their own hands.</p><br/><p>Karim shook his head while looking at Ekidu and spoke.</p><br/><p>With a helpless expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat more are you asking for? This is still very much democratic. Living like this in a world such as this is very good. Ekidu, remember that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Like this huh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ekidu clenched her teeth.</p><br/><p>It was a word she really hated in the past.</p><br/><p>Since those words were just excuses.</p><br/><p>But in a situation like this, those were the only words that managed to comfort her in any sense.</p><br/><p>Ekidu sighed deeply and then spoke with a heavy expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. Bring everyone to the inner parts to the village and seal them. The vote\u2026Begins.\u201d</p><br/><p>Karim then nodded as he checked the population of the village.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. Oh and by the way\u2026There are no preferences and special treatments.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Karim nodded as he walked out.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026This doesn\u2019t feel very good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Altair, one of the newcomers who had come with Hansoo to the village, made a nervous expression while looking around her surroundings.</p><br/><p>Since the entire place was in chaos.</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry and go into the village!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamnit! Just use words man! We\u2019re going in!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere else would we go anyway!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was being shoved through the 52 wooden doors all around the village.</p><br/><p>Everyone including the Hunters and the Farmers.</p><br/><p>And these people started to move towards the residential area after coming into the village.</p><br/><p>To them who moved around in rotations, being pushed in all at once was quite a hassle.</p><br/><p>\u2018The issue is\u2026 Why is it suddenly like this?\u2019</p><br/><p>A hassle like this was something quite hard to see usually.</p><br/><p>At this rate the village\u2019s system which was needed for it to continue to run would stop.</p><br/><p>What kind of event was this that every hour they spent in the Otherworld in leisure was another hour closer to death?</p><br/><p>They even thought of running away from the suspicious air but what could they do anyway?</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>Kuugugugugugu</p><br/><p>All the wooden doors started to close up after they all entered.</p><br/><p>Every single door from the outermost wall and the fences that divided the three areas.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>All the doors of the wooden walls were sealed.</p><br/><p>At the same time some people walked up the hundred scouting posts placed atop of the outermost walls.</p><br/><p>Altair frowned as she looked at the people surrounding her as if not one of the people here could escape.</p><br/><p>\u2018They are\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Guards.</p><br/><p>They were hard to find in the first place anyway, why were they moving in such a large scale?</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>Karim, who was standing on top of the highest scouting post, shouted out loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe vote begins now! The time limit is 3 days. Whatever you do\u2026Receive the recommendations of three people! By proving that you\u2019re useful to the village. Those who fail to receive the recommendations of three people will all get sent as an offering!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Offering?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course we wouldn\u2019t stop you sacrificing yourself for your comrades, prove your worth if you don\u2019t want to become an offering! To your comrades! Achieve three votes no matter what!\u201d</p><br/><p>At the same time everyone\u2019 expression split up.</p><br/><p>Between the leisurely ones and the pressured ones.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamnit! It was two last time! Why is it three now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAaaaaaahh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing can be done. The balance has been broken because newcomers haven\u2019t come in recently. Begin!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone looked at Altair and Hansoo with evil expressions after hearing the word newcomers.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Are you trying to take all the glory?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo scoffed at Kiriel and then nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine. We\u2019ll tell them to write it all in detail.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiriel fastened Enbi Arin on her back even tighter after receiving Hansoo\u2019s permission.</p><br/><p>\u2014chaaarrrrk\u2014 </p><br/><p>Various skills from Kiriel\u2019s body protected Enbi Arin and kept her in place.</p><br/><p>She\u2019d even thought of hiding her somewhere, but leaving her behind in some random place in the middle of a battlefield wouldn\u2019t be the best plan.</p><br/><p>Especially since a random patrol robot could destroy Enbi Arin with her current status.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ll protect her for now.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo was stronger than her, but Hansoo was someone who fought in the frontlines like a madman. It didn\u2019t suit him to take care of a patient.</p><br/><p>She, a support-type fighter who fought from the backlines, was a much better choice to carry Enbi Arin around.</p><br/><p>Kiriel asked Hansoo:</p><br/><p>\u201c...Are we charging straight through the doors?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiriel glanced at the city surrounded by the white fog.</p><br/><p>Suppressing her fear.</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.

All nine. We brought them with us in case of a situation like this. It\u2019s time to use them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Such a slow kid.\u2019</p><br/><p>Although it was mechanical armor, half of it was biological anyway.</p><br/><p>Plus the Dragon God Armor could work inside the Mimir as long as it was under the control of the Dragon God Armor.</p><br/><p>The Dragon God Armor was actually the force they would\u2019ve used in case the Aokan ever formed a rebellion.</p><br/><p>\u2018Although I didn\u2019t expect to find things like that roaming around.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014kyaaaak!\u2014 </p><br/><p>R-Koronaita Nell frowned at seeing strange monsters shoving something inside the human\u2019s stomachs and then shouted:</p><br/><p>\u201cDescend! Find out what it\u2019s hiding inside and stop the Mimir! That\u2019s the only way the fleet can approach!\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the Dragon God Soldiers, who was preparing to go down, asked:</p><br/><p>R-Koronaita Nell didn\u2019t even flinch as he said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThink of them as wild animals. You are now going through a jungle. Although there\u2019s no need to kill them\u2026 there\u2019s no point in overlooking the things that annoy us.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Dragon God Soldier smiled as if he\u2019d expected R-Koronaita Nell\u2019s answer.</p><br/><p>Soon\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014swooosh!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014nine beams of light descended downwards.</p><br/><p>And R-Koronaita Nell smiled as he looked at the nine descending meteors.</p><br/><p>\u2018Melchizedek, I wonder what your expression will look like when your head gets taken apart piece-by-piece?\u2019</p><br/><p>Would it make a similar expression as the countless rivals that had lost to him?</p><br/><p>Or would it make an expression like those whose heads he\u2019d taken off?</p><br/><p>Because of his status as a fleet master, he\u2019d hidden this secret, but it was one of his greatest hobbies.</p><br/><p>R-Koronaita Nell looked forward to that moment and looked down at Aokan beneath him.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201cNine are coming down.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014kiririririk\u2014 </p><br/><p>Kiriel could see nine meteors with her enhanced vision.</p><br/><p>And her already skill-enhanced vision was further enhanced through the lens on the visor.</p><br/><p>\u2018They\u2019re all strong.\u2019</p><br/><p>At Kiriel\u2019s level, observing their simple movements was enough to show their strength.</p><br/><p>Even while falling from the sky, they looked laid-back but were still very much on their guard.</p><br/><p>\u2018They don\u2019t look simple.\u2019</p><br/><p>And at that moment\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014kiiiiiing!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014something started to shoot out from their bodies.</p><br/><p>And as the biomechanical grenades landed\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014boomboooboomboooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014giant explosions occurred as they swept past their landing position.</p><br/><p>Looking at the scene, Hansoo said:</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go in now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that much chaos, all attention would focus on them.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo reminded Kiriel before heading off:</p><br/><p>\u201cYou remember, right? We\u2019ll separate once we go in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiriel gulped at those words but nodded as she replied:</p><br/><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were two types of enemies they had to fight inside.</p><br/><p>Melchizedek\u2019s forces and the Abyssal beings.</p><br/><p>The best scenario would be to just kill the Abyssal beasts, gain crystals, raise herself and Enbi Arin to a 3-Star and then go up.</p><br/><p>Of course, Melchizedek wouldn\u2019t just sit by and watch.</p><br/><p>But if they only focused on Melchizedek\u2019s forces, Enbi Arin might die, or they might get swept away by something else.</p><br/><p>So they had chosen this:</p><br/><p>Hansoo would attract Melchizedek's attention, and while he dealt with its forces, Kiriel would roam the city and hunt the Abyssal beings.</p><br/><p>If they could end it fast and quickly get up to 3-Star, then that would be the best outcome.</p><br/><p>Of course in this life, not everything goes according to one\u2019s wishes.</p><br/><p>\u2018Haa\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>As Kiriel gulped, Hansoo started to cover himself in skills.</p><br/><p>In order to charge in first.</p><br/><p>\u2018Kiriel, I believe in you.\u2019</p><br/><p>She would do well.</p><br/><p>She was a smart girl.</p><br/><p>He just needed to do one thing.</p><br/><p>Let Kiriel move freely.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014kiriririk!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014blue particles started to seep out from underneath Hansoo\u2019s skin.</p><br/><p>The crystalline particles hidden between his bones, his veins, and his muscles, seeped out and covered his skin.</p><br/><p>And the Ark Roa\u2019s crystal filled in the space between the pieces of armor.</p><br/><p>A blue armor quickly covered Hansoo\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>And as the blue armor compressed aHansoo\u2019s body, it made a gleeful sound by creating friction with the armor pieces.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014pushuk!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014shukshuk!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hundreds of tiny spines shot out from various parts of its body and embedded themselves into Hansoo\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>As if the Ark-Roa\u2019s energy wasn\u2019t enough, the blue armor started frenziedly sucking Hansoo\u2019s energy out through the spines attached to his body.</p><br/><p>And as the extra energy around various parts of Hansoo\u2019s body got sucked into the armor\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014kiiiiing!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014the mana jade resting inside him acted up as it started to pour out mana.</p><br/><p>Activating the Immortal Soul, which started regenerating the sucked-out life force.</p><br/><p>Hansoo smiled as he felt what was currently happening inside his body.</p><br/><p>\u2018Good, very good.\u2019</p><br/><p>A normal human being would probably die once their life force ran out but it was a nice stimulus for him.</p><br/><p>It tensed up his entire body and accelerated his movements.</p><br/><p>And as if his brain\u2019s sleeping defense mechanisms had determined that the blue armor\u2019s actions were life-threatening, it started hastily secreting adrenaline throughout his body.</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s body soon transformed into something that was ideal for smashing things apart.</p><br/><p>As if the armor was trying to prove that it wasn\u2019t a thief, it started emitting a bright light as it sucked in Hansoo\u2019s energy.</p><br/><p>\u2014kiiiiing!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Explosive strength squirmed around his body.</p><br/><p>And his senses were elevated to the point where he couldn\u2019t bear to stand still anymore.</p><br/><p>Hansoo spoke to Kiriel:</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 going ahead.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014booooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014Hansoo\u2019s bright body flew off into the fog like a meteor.</p><br/><p>And soon\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014booooooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014a huge sound reverberated as a massive earthquake, much larger than the one from the previous explosions, shook the entire city.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble!\u2014 </p><br/><p>A few females woke up from the tremendous earthquake.</p><br/><p>And this included Ariel, whose mouth had been defiled by that insectoid monster.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ugh\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Ariel woke up with a much thinner face than before, and she looked to where the vibration had originated from, but then soon let her head droop.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m going to sleep.

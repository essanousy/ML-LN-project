We said that you can take the things you earned while hunting but that we needed to keep a ratio between hunting and defending.\u201d</p><br/><p>Guktae made a slightly anxious face but then quickly shook his head.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t back off here.</p><br/><p>\u2018Then my rebellion was useless\u2019</p><br/><p>They had grown to the point where nothing can shake them.</p><br/><p>But this was only possible because Hansoo had given them all the power.</p><br/><p>So he was curious.</p><br/><p>What did he believe in to hand all the power over to them and raising them like so.</p><br/><p>\u2018I need to find what he is believing in\u2019</p><br/><p>Their clans were at a level where it couldn\u2019t be compared to the ones of the past.</p><br/><p>Because Hansoo in front of them had created a safe measure, they could fight faster and have less casualties.</p><br/><p>And the non-members under his authority had become closer to him due to his hospitality.</p><br/><p>Everything from quantity to quality.</p><br/><p>Their power could not even compare to Hansoo when he had crushed the others on the first day.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well\u2026 This guy did indeed get strong too.\u2019</p><br/><p>It seemed that he had gotten strong as well.</p><br/><p>As if he had gotten strong by eating the colorless runes from the dungeon.</p><br/><p>\u2018Though it\u2019s amazing that all his runes are colorless\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that blades didn\u2019t go through.</p><br/><p>How could the speed at which one person gets stronger compare to the speed of 150~160 people getting stronger.</p><br/><p>\u2018And I\u2019m not alone\u2019</p><br/><p>At least a few clans had the same thoughts as Hansoo and the defenses will fall if they aren\u2019t here.</p><br/><p>So how could he attack him in such a situation.</p><br/><p>The only reason why they had some leisure was because the 12 clans were defending, and if there is a fight then the defense will break apart.</p><br/><p>\u2018But there\u2019s still some leisure\u2019</p><br/><p>Which meant there exists something that could threaten them.</p><br/><p>And Guktae did not like the current situation where he did not know what that could be.</p><br/><p>\u2018I need to poke him a bit more\u2019</p><br/><p>Guktae, who had finished his thoughts, made a leisurely face as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cI mean come on. Friend. Listen. Would that fairy thing leave us like this? It\u2019s logical to be getting strong while we have the leisure to do so. You need to have some flexibility in the rules\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo made an amused expression as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you discuss it with other clansmen? I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s in the agreement. The ratio of hunting and defense won\u2019t be decided by one clan but rather on the consensus of six clans.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yerin glared at Guktae in anger.</p><br/><p>Her clan had taken damage because that guy hadn\u2019t followed that rule and acted how he wanted.</p><br/><p>Jimin, her precious younger sister, was injured and was recovering.</p><br/><p>Guktae mumbled inwardly.</p><br/><p>\u2018What would it mean to follow such rules\u2019</p><br/><p>The reason why he had discreetly taken out some forces was to be better than other clans.</p><br/><p>He knew instinctively.</p><br/><p>This place was dangerous but it was a place where they could get stronger much faster than in the other islands.</p><br/><p>They needed to create a gap here so they can crush down the others after getting higher.</p><br/><p>But if all the clans were to put with the same ratio of clansmen in the fight then what would it mean if there were 11 other clans at a similar level as his?</p><br/><p>Superiority was a result of difference.</p><br/><p>It hadn\u2019t been long since he had come here but he knew something very important.</p><br/><p>\u2018I must get strong whenever I get the chance to. Without stopping.\u2019</p><br/><p>That was the only way of winning.</p><br/><p>\u2018But I can\u2019t say it out loud like that\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was because it was a decision that came up whilst I was thinking. It seemed like everyone was busy.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was an excuse that a dog wouldn\u2019t believe but that was why it was effective.</p><br/><p>\u2018Quickly. Show me what you are believing in\u2019</p><br/><p>Does he act like this because he believes he can cut off their necks here?</p><br/><p>Guktae knew that Hansoo wasn\u2019t somebody dumb.</p><br/><p>And there were plenty of guards outside.</p><br/><p>He would get surrounded immediately.</p><br/><p>But at that moment Guktae, who was making a leisurely expression, froze for a moment.</p><br/><p>\u2018Wait. How did he get in here?\u2019</p><br/><p>At that moment Guktae felt a chill run down his back.</p><br/><p>The location of their conference room was right below the lookout tower for the crystal they had to protect.</p><br/><p>This was the safest room where the castle\u2019s entirety was visible.</p><br/><p>That was why they had decided for it to be their conference room.</p><br/><p>Since it would be cumbersome if some crazy few ones caused terror because they don\u2019t like how things are.</p><br/><p>And they had selected the most trusted people in their clans as guards and had set them up outside.</p><br/><p>Three from each of 12 clans to make 36.</p><br/><p>The conference doesn\u2019t last long so if it wasn\u2019t a number that affected the defense and as a Lord, they should have at least this much privilege.</p><br/><p>But there was no sound of clashing.</p><br/><p>\u2018Did he perhaps crush them all?\u2019</p><br/><p>Everyone had been looking at Hansoo with similar expressions.</p><br/><p>Hansoo chuckled as he laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou see, I\u2019ve gotten a new merchandise these days. To fit the season.\u201d</p><br/><p>And then Hansoo sent in a bit of mana onto the bracelet on his wrist.</p><br/><p>Shshhhhk.</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s body quickly disappeared from the site.</p><br/><p>The eyes of the Lords became cold.</p><br/><p>\u2018That is\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Invisibility.</p><br/><p>If that was it then it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.</p><br/><p>Since their perception stat wasn\u2019t that bad to the point where they would lose the enemy because they couldn\u2019t see something.</p><br/><p>But they couldn\u2019t see where he was.</p><br/><p>He had disappeared in front of them but they didn\u2019t know where in the room he was.</p><br/><p>There was something that worked even against their increased perception.</p><br/><p>There was a skill that helped with perfect invisibility on that bracelet.</p><br/><p>If a weakling had used it then it would\u2019ve been obvious but they couldn\u2019t know because of the bracelet\u2019s powers coupled with Hansoo\u2019s movements.</p><br/><p>Everyone felt chills run down their back.</p><br/><p>He had walked through their most trustworthy 36 clansmen.</p><br/><p>Despite the fact that they were on extreme alert.</p><br/><p>This meant that the amount of the clan\u2019s strength wasn\u2019t important.</p><br/><p>What would it mean if the surrounding army was strong.</p><br/><p>It would be over right away if he cut your neck in your sleep.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026He showed it to us on purpose\u2019</p><br/><p>Why would he show something so precious?</p><br/><p>Something like that was a hidden card.</p><br/><p>But he had shown it to them on purpose.</p><br/><p>It meant do things well on their own.</p><br/><p>Guktae finally knew why Hansoo wasn\u2019t interested in the position of a leader.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026You just need to take down the twelve of us huh?\u2019</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t control the 2000 people alone.</p><br/><p>That was impossible no matter how strong he was.</p><br/><p>But that was possible for Clan Lords.</p><br/><p>And that was why he had given 2000 people over to the Clan Lords.</p><br/><p>Since as long as he controlled the twelve of them, it was like controlling all of them.</p><br/><p>Hansoo mumbled inwardly whilst looking at Guktae.</p><br/><p>\u2018I got it right on time\u2019</p><br/><p>It absorbed the user\u2019s mana to give basic invisibility as well as sending out force waves to interfere with the enemy\u2019s perception.</p><br/><p>And it was something he needed to acquire first in this dungeon of the Central Island.</p><br/><p>If this is combined with his movements then most people wouldn\u2019t even be able to find him.</p><br/><p>Of course it would be useless in battle because of the aura and harsh moments but this wasn\u2019t for such times.</p><br/><p>He had invested all his time in the dungeon in order to gain this.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well. Thankfully I got all my runes up to Colorless.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo, who had finished his thoughts, showed himself back to the Clan Lords as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt may happen that a person makes a mistake. We can solve it with talks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen the profit you gained from extra hunting will be shared equally with the clansmen participating in the defense and you can just fix the ratio of hunting and defense tomorrow right? Oh and give payments to the injured for compensation.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was exactly like it was written in the original rules.</p><br/><p>A few Clan Lords grinded their teeth at this but nodded their heads.</p><br/><p>They realized that they weren\u2019t in a situation to try to show their guts anymore.</p><br/><p>But Guktae still looked at Hansoo just in case.</p><br/><p>\u2018Shall I provoke him a bit more?\u2019</p><br/><p>It hadn\u2019t ended yet.</p><br/><p>Even if they didn\u2019t follow the rules, he wasn\u2019t in the situation to attack them.</p><br/><p>Since the castle would become dangerous without them.</p><br/><p>There was a huge difference between twelve Lords and one person.</p><br/><p>And he probably wasn\u2019t the only Lord with the same thoughts.</p><br/><p>But Guktae shook his head after seeing Hansoo\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2018I can\u2019t\u2019</p><br/><p>Those eyes weren\u2019t those which would let him go.</p><br/><p>He was smiling but the eyes were cold.</p><br/><p>He had seen those eyes before.</p><br/><p>\u2018It was like this before\u2019</p><br/><p>Those were the same eyes as when he crushed the 30 people on the first day.</p><br/><p>He realized after Hansoo\u2019s eyes which were looking for a reason to give a good lesson.</p><br/><p>He was looking at it in such a way that if he beat one down in order to show the others then it would be fine.</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t killed them before but there was no proof that he wouldn\u2019t this time.</p><br/><p>\u2018Just this much for today.\u2019</p><br/><p>Udududk</p><br/><p>Guktae took a step back after mumbling inside his head.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t stand the fact that somebody else was above him.</p><br/><p>He really really did not like that.</p><br/><p>And that was why he wanted to have a stronger power than others.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo had clearly shown him who was holding onto his lifeline.</p><br/><p>His rage was bubbling but he had to retreat for today.</p><br/><p>\u2018I shall excuse you just for a while\u2019</p><br/><p>Guktae was a person who firmly believed in the limitations of one person\u2019s strength.</p><br/><p>The person in front of him was a bit different and that was why he had lost superiority here but eventually a chance will come along again.</p><br/><p>The conference ended like so and Hansoo chuckled as he looked at the people walking down.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well. Somebody who uses their head is better\u2019</p><br/><p>You can\u2019t give up on a blade because the edge was too sharp and it might cut you.</p><br/><p>It was better the sharper it was.</p><br/><p>\u2018Not listening to my words is in the expectations as well.\u2019</p><br/><p>There would be nobody left on this island if he cut off their heads because he didn\u2019t like them or because they were greedy.</p><br/><p>All of the tutorial was full of greedy people, it was just that the degree of their greediness was different.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that all of them had turned greedy in just 10 days.</p><br/><p>Since 10 days was a bit too short to change one\u2019s true nature which they had lived with for decades.</p><br/><p>But ten days was more than enough to kill of every kind person who would care for others.</p><br/><p>And people realized as others quickly died off next to them.</p><br/><p>That encouraging good and punishing evil was only possible in a book or something.</p><br/><p>This was not a place where a kind hero of justice would survive but rather a place where someone who would hit that hero from the back would survive.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well. Eres was a special case.\u2019</p><br/><p>If you searched then a few would exist but then they really needed to be blessed.</p><br/><p>Since it meant that they had the luck and skill to keep their kindheartedness whilst surviving.</p><br/><p>There weren\u2019t many people who weren\u2019t greedy in front of death and the people who had survived were learning of these things very quickly.</p><br/><p>The game was very long and they could only survive by crushing others on the island above.</p><br/><p>So how much would their insides hurt since they had to distribute things fairly in such a situation?</p><br/><p>This won\u2019t last long either.</p><br/><p>So he needed to do something before then.</p><br/><p>\u2018The thing I need to get next is\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>The fairy indeed did not lie.</p><br/><p>Since it was clear that this was a land of opportunity.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s coming.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked at the sky.</p><br/><p>And soon after, the fairy appeared.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The fairy which had appeared suddenly above the castle.</p><br/><p>\u2018Can\u2019t it just piss of\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Everyone in the castle frowned as the fairy appeared.</p><br/><p>The fairy greeted everyone as it saw their looks.</p><br/><p>\u201cHi everyone! Aww, Don\u2019t frown like that. I\u2019m not here to lay my hands on you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you look at me with such distrustful eyes then you\u2019ll hurt me. I\u2019m just here to tell you something which I didn\u2019t tell you about. It\u2019s not much. If the crystal gets crushed then the whole island will fall. Well. It won\u2019t fall right away. It\u2019ll fall slowly in about 10 to 20 days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t much shock between the people.</p><br/><p>Since they had expected as such.</p><br/><p>The fact that they had to protect it with all their strength did not change.</p><br/><p>The fairy spoke as it looked at these people.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe actual important part is the second part. You were all comfortable so far right? The undead is\u2026 well, just child\u2019s play. This team defended better than I thought. The demons will start coming out on this third day!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026fuck.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everybody cursed as they looked at the fairy.</p><br/><p>That son of a fly was like a messenger of destruction.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t a bit of good news whenever it opened its mouth.</p><br/><p>The fairy made a slightly hurt expression at those words but then opened its mouth again.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys are too much. Don\u2019t you realize how good of a news that the demons are coming out is? This is a really rare chance for you guys!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone looked at the fairy at those words.</p><br/><p>The fairy did mention it before.</p><br/><p>That there were extravagant rewards.</p><br/><p>But even then it would be all over if they died.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t some crappy rune or artifact. If you kill the Demons then a mini-crystal comes out. Hehee.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you collect the Mini-Crystals then you can trade it for a really good artifact! It is much better than the ones you have. It\u2019s obvious that the reward would be better the more you collect right? Look at the catalogue in your pocket for those. By the way there aren\u2019t many demons, you need to try harder than the others in order to get the crystals\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone made a sour expression.</p><br/><p>Even if they had such things, it would merely be pearls on a pig\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>And how would they collect enough from the bits the demons dropped to trade it for an artifact when there\u2019s thousands of people?</p><br/><p>They might not be able to lay their hands on one after a whole month.</p><br/><p>Even if they did lay their hands on it, only the Clan Lords would do so.</p><br/><p>\u2018And the thing that that thing will throw at us won\u2019t be weak.\u2019</p><br/><p>As the people made sour expressions, the Fairy added another thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. I didn\u2019t say this yet. There\u2019s another use for the crystal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as you have the crystal, you can leave this island to go to the island above at anytime. Isn\u2019t it a really good privilege? The people with it won\u2019t need to care if everybody dies either from falling after the crystal gets shattered or from being invaded by demons right? A total of five people can move on. Heehee.\u201d</p><br/><p>No matter if that giant crystal broke or not.</p><br/><p>No matter if the defense line broke apart or not.</p><br/><p>They can escape this dangerous situation to a different island at any time.</p><br/><p>Which meant that this was a privilege equal to a life.</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s expressions changed at these words.</p><br/><p>The story was different then.</p><br/><p>The fairy smiled as it looked at everyone\u2019s expressions.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou get it? About how important of an existence the Demons are? Be strong everyone. One demon coming your way for today!\u201d</p><br/><p>And the fairy disappeared as a beastly looking otherworldly existence started to slowly approach them.</p><br/><p>Everyone started to calculated their risks.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t enough information yet.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t know how strong the Demon was and they also didn\u2019t know how the others would act.</p><br/><p>But one thing was clear.</p><br/><p>That it was better to get it before others do.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t charge in first but they had no thoughts of missing this chance.</p><br/><p>Since it wouldn\u2019t matter if they just kill the person who obtained it as soon as they get it.</p><br/><p>Everyone knew that the best scenario was to attack them as the one who charged it was was about to kill it so everyone stood still while standing close to each other. [*PR Note: Kill Steal!]</p><br/><p>Hansoo shook his head as he looked at this scene.</p><br/><p>\u2018It starts now.\u2019</p><br/><p>A different name for the Central Island that attracted people below with its sweet runes and artifacts.</p><br/><p>If you disregard the people who went up using the crystals then the survival rate here was 8%.</p><br/><p>And this was only when the defense is successful. Since they would all die if they fail.</p><br/><p>And this was all because of that damnable Crystal.</p><br/><p>\u2018I must take it so nobody uses it\u2019</p><br/><p>If five die in order to attain it and another five go up using it, then 5 more will die from lack of numbers.</p><br/><p>Which meant in conclusion, five will live and ten will die.</p><br/><p>It was not an object that should be allowed to be set free.</p><br/><p>And at the same time it was something he needed to collect.</p><br/><p>\u2018I will collect it and exchange it for .\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo walked forward after looking at the others for a while and everyone\u2019s eyes shone at Hansoo\u2019s back instead of the Demon\u2019s.</p><br/><p>KobatoChan\u2019s Note</p><br/><p>Erm\u2026the second sponsored chapter of the day is here.</p><br/><p>Had to correct too much.

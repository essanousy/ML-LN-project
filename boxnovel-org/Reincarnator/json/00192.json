No matter what.\u2019</p><br/><p>Though one had died the situation was still very bad.</p><br/><p>The Higher Races were on a rampage from the mana having disappearing and the other surviving adventurers were doing everything they can in order to survive.</p><br/><p>\u2018But how?\u2019</p><br/><p>Chen fell into his thoughts.</p><br/><p>Looking at things logically, the seven of them were baggage.</p><br/><p>He could just tell from the eyes of the man with the bow looking at him with annoyance.</p><br/><p>And this was the truth.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fuck. You\u2019re a leech as well.\u2019</p><br/><p>As Chen was mumbling.</p><br/><p>A conversation was heard by him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need to find the 1st Generation ones.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment he heard it.</p><br/><p>Chen shouted out instinctively.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know! I know where a 1st Generation one is!\u201d</p><br/><p>From Chen\u2019s words the heads of the two, who had been ignoring him the whole time, turned around.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes.\u2019</p><br/><p>Chen celebrated within his mind.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201cHaa\u2026Ha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen, who had been looking at the surroundings while hiding between the rubble, slowly came out and moved again after checking that nobody was around.</p><br/><p>Karhal followed Chen through the wooden structures as he asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo the 1st Generation ones are here right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen nodded as he was guiding Hansoo, Karhal and the others.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. And it\u2019s not ones but just one. There aren\u2019t that many 1st Generations around anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thousands of Higher Races had come to see them while they were caught in this Birdcage.</p><br/><p>But even out of all the Higher Races there weren\u2019t that many that lived over hundreds of years.</p><br/><p>Mainly three to four per race.</p><br/><p>Of course there were even less of them who came to the Birdcage.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen one from the Akalachias here. They should definitely be here since it hadn\u2019t even been a day since they came here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The wooden structure in the distance was a location where the Akalachias usually enjoyed their stay.</p><br/><p>It was very likely that they were still in here.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, why are you being informal with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen ignored Karhal\u2019s words as he focused on guiding them.</p><br/><p>Towards a direction where they could hide from the eyes of the Higher Races the best.</p><br/><p>\u2018I must stay by these guys no matter what.\u2019</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t finding a perfectly safe location.</p><br/><p>Since there wouldn\u2019t be such a place like this.</p><br/><p>His goal was finding a place that was as safe as possible.</p><br/><p>\u2018At least until this chaos calms down\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Tania spoke to Chen with sign languages.</p><br/><p>Chen frowned at this.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damned Bastards. If they all charged in then\u2026 We could\u2019ve won. Cowards.\u2019</p><br/><p>Chen grinded his teeth as he stopped his bleeding from his missing left arm which had been bit off my Makeronia.</p><br/><p>No matter how strong they were they were still adventurers who can gained quite a lot of runes.</p><br/><p>If 400 people charged in then they would easily be able to kill one.</p><br/><p>But the moment Chen and others charged in, everyone else had ran away.</p><br/><p>\u2018I hope they all die.\u2019</p><br/><p>Chen suppressed his feelings as he softly replied to Tania.</p><br/><p>Tania nodded at this.</p><br/><p>They were being able to dodge the eyes of the Higher Race as of now since they only had nine people.</p><br/><p>But if there were 400 people?</p><br/><p>It would be hard to dodge the eyes of the Higher Races roaming around in rage.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is too smooth.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tania made a confused expression while heading towards their goal after having come out from the debris.</p><br/><p>This was the territory of the Akalachias who acted solo.</p><br/><p>But it was strange that they hadn\u2019t seen a single Rebeloongs or Arukons who were high in number.</p><br/><p>It was comfortable but too unusual.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026We need to check our surroundings.\u2019</p><br/><p>The moment Tania raised his five senses to the brim.</p><br/><p>Kiiiing</p><br/><p>Kiing</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026This sound is.\u201d</p><br/><p>The extremely high voices that she hadn\u2019t been able to hear came into her ears after she focused her senses.</p><br/><p>A special call that the Rebeloongs used to call the members of their race.</p><br/><p>\u2018I feel uneasy.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tania and Chen frowned.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>2nd Generation Rebeloong, Kalipso, frowned as he looked at the members around him.</p><br/><p>Almost 900.</p><br/><p>Since quite some time had been past since the chaos had started, it was normal for everyone to have gathered by now.</p><br/><p>But an empty space could be seen.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Makeronia?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kalipso asked the others but everyone shrugged their shoulders and nobody answered.</p><br/><p>Which meant that they didn\u2019t know.</p><br/><p>Kalipso frowned from this.</p><br/><p>\u2018There\u2019s no way that he got killed by the humans or anything.\u2019</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that the humans weren\u2019t a threat.</p><br/><p>They had lost their mana and there were much more humans than them here anyway.</p><br/><p>But there wasn\u2019t anyone who had heard Makeronia\u2019s call.</p><br/><p>It was impossible for the 3rd Generation Makeronia to have died before he could use his call even if a swarm of humans came onto him.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s only one kind of guys who can do that.</p><br/><p>Well, two different types.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damned bastards, I knew this would happen.\u2019</p><br/><p>Kalipso tapped his protruded front teeth.</p><br/><p>A sound that he made when he was in a foul mood.</p><br/><p>Kaliso spoke towards his surroundings.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys know why I gathered you right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone nodded.</p><br/><p>Since their cries meant more than just calling each other.</p><br/><p>If the Arukons had powerful bodies and a sixth sense and the Akalachias had powerful battle strength and the ability to fly then they had insane reproduction abilities along with their destruction beams and the communication ability to utilize their numbers.</p><br/><p>Anyways, Kalipso opened his mouth again in order to explain again.</p><br/><p>\u2018Strange\u2026Our calls don\u2019t work as well here.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is our chance. A very precious one.\u201d</p><br/><p>A group\u2019s battle prowess important but a leader was important as well.</p><br/><p>A great burden laid upon the leader in this place where they were cut off from mana.</p><br/><p>This place was originally a place made for high ranked officials of the Higher Races to enjoy their time.</p><br/><p>People who should have been protected until the very end if not for a chaotic situation such as this.</p><br/><p>Such people were all trapped within these tight spaces.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe balance has been tipped already since we found out the Destruction Jade is in here already.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment they found out the Destruction Jade\u2019s whereabouts, they had no reason to hold back anymore.</p><br/><p>What they were worried about was them annoying a human and only their race being affected by the Destruction jade.</p><br/><p>But since it was already activated like this, there was nothing to hold back.</p><br/><p>\u2018And we just need to kill every living in here, simple.\u2019</p><br/><p>And they were at a huge advantage.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe dog heads lost their king and the Akalachias are powerful but they roam around alone, they can\u2019t fly in here anyway.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Though I don\u2019t know why.\u2019</p><br/><p>In this strange Birdcage, the Akalachias couldn\u2019t fly and the Arukons couldn\u2019t utilize their Sixth Sense.</p><br/><p>And they couldn\u2019t use their cries to call each other that well either.</p><br/><p>It seemed like the 1st Generations knew something but they didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well. We can just ask after we go out. Or ask those parrots before they die.\u2019</p><br/><p>Kalipso laughed coldly as he thought of the 1st Generation over at the Akalachia territory, Pektoril.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe only ones who survive in here\u2026Are our race.\u201d</p><br/><p>Going against the two races who have lost their leaders would be very easy.</p><br/><p>One of the 3rd Generation member, Amedos, asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what about the humans? There are too many for us to ignore.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were in an advantage, the vicious Arukons and powerful Akalachias were no pushovers.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t have the strength to fight the humans at the same time as well.</p><br/><p>Kalipso laughed coldly at Amedos\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t ignore our precious resources. Let\u2019s just play the game we usually play. The war game.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKeke. Then I shall play with the guys at the 1st region.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c38th region for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other Rebeloongs made amused and excited expressions at Kalipso\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Booom!</p><br/><p>\u201cFucking hell!\u201d</p><br/><p>Karhal saw the adventurers causing a ruckus as he made a dumbfounded expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cKill it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn! I\u2019m the one who killed them!\u201d</p><br/><p>The humans were killing each other.</p><br/><p>They were fighting each other with a headband that had strange symbols on their head.</p><br/><p>\u2018Are they crazy?\u2019</p><br/><p>They should be hiding quietly or trying to strike the Higher Races but why the hell were they killing each other.</p><br/><p>And from the way they were moving they weren\u2019t doing in a urgent manner either.</p><br/><p>They made formations and stayed true each person\u2019s roles and acted very naturally.</p><br/><p>As if it was very familiar to them.</p><br/><p>Karhal spoke towards Chen guiding them.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Why the hell are those crazy guys doing that.\u201d</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t a survival game or anything, why the hell were they fighting with those headbands.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh yeah\u2026You came from above. You shouldn\u2019t know then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen clenched his teeth and mumbled.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a game. A war game.\u201d</p><br/><p>The administrator of this game was the Higher Race.</p><br/><p>The pawns of the game were humans.</p><br/><p>The rule was simple.</p><br/><p>The 400 man people of different regions will kill as many people as they can and take their headbands.</p><br/><p>When the timer ends the region with the highest number of headbands would be victorious and the owner of that area won.</p><br/><p>Though they had lost their mana and had been freed, the difference in rankings still existed.</p><br/><p>Mana will come back eventually and they will face the judgement of the Higher Race.</p><br/><p>It was obvious that they followed the orders of the Higher Race.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t weird either.</p><br/><p>Since they had lived like this ever since they got trapped in the Birdcage.</p><br/><p>Chen had tried attacking because he hadn\u2019t been here for that long.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn. They made a game in the midst of this chaos?\u2019</p><br/><p>Chen grinded his teeth while looking around.</p><br/><p>Moving around in a small group in order to not get caught by the Higher Races would actually hurt them in this situation.</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t dodge the eyes of that many people.</p><br/><p>Chen shouted towards Hansoo in despair.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince it happened like this. Let\u2019s go over there as well!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Karhal made a dumbfounded expression, Chen made an annoyed expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what? You want to go through that thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen then pointed towards the vicinity of their target.</p><br/><p>And Karhal spat on the ground as he saw where the finger was pointing towards.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck\u2026It\u2019s busy enough fighting those monsters but we have to kill the humans as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>For them to kill humans in order to kill the beast.</p><br/><p>Hansoo and Karhal frowned as he looked at the adventurers swarming towards their direction from the Akalachia\u2019s territory.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThese rat bastards. I knew you would do this. Those guys excel at betrayal.\u201d</p><br/><p>A giant bird with a height of 10m mumbled as he looked at the Rebeloongs and humans charging towards him from the distance.</p><br/><p>He was a bird but just like the Arukons and Rebeloongs, the muscular humanoid lifeform was closer to a human with a beak and wings than a bird.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well whatever. Since we needed to be closer to a human\u2019s shape in order to receive the remodeling surgery of the Sages\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Akalachia, Pektoril, thought of the things that had been done to him hundreds of years ago as he stared at the Rebeloongs charging towards him.</p><br/><p>The ones who had betrayed the Sages first hundreds of years ago were these Rebeloongs as well.</p><br/><p>\u2018Good. I shall wipe you all off this time around. Come. I shall smash you one by one in order.\u2019</p><br/><p>Pektoril moved up the units in his area and squirmed the muscles in his body as he mumbled.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

What kind of words are those?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although they gave it the simple name of .</p><br/><p>It was not just a simple ball of flame.</p><br/><p>The small sun that was sleeping inside the planet.</p><br/><p>The , hidden inside the shell of this planet, was something to be revered and feared.</p><br/><p>Everybody could see the red sun of their planet through the between the continents.</p><br/><p>It was the source of life for their planet, which had once been doomed to freeze to death after their previous sun had died out.</p><br/><p>Giving their race the power to control the fleet and travel through the universe.</p><br/><p>They only called it a , but in reality, it was more like a sun.</p><br/><p>N-Aroel, the Nerpa, chuckled.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah? Then is it logical for a sun to stay trapped within a tiny planet? To release that kind of energy without control, you guys clearly know that it should\u2019ve long since reduced your entire planet into a blazing ball of flames.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...Ugh.\u201d</p><br/><p>R-Koronaita Nell fell silent.</p><br/><p>Those words were correct.</p><br/><p>That was a question that no researcher on Angkara could answer.</p><br/><p>A ball of energy trapped within their planet that should\u2019ve been tens of thousands of times larger than what it appeared.</p><br/><p>Maintaining a very calm state that wasn\u2019t causing any harm to their planet that surrounded it like a thin shell.</p><br/><p>Very illogical indeed.</p><br/><p>The Nerpa chuckled towards Angkara that had now appeared before his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2018I didn\u2019t know this would happen.\u2019</p><br/><p>The that the Nerpa had bestowed upon them thousands of years ago.</p><br/><p>They had stepped out and bestowed the to a planet that was about to freeze due to the death of their sun.</p><br/><p>Although it wasn\u2019t as big as the original sun, the Nerpa had dug out the insides of that giant planet\u2014which was already many times larger than a normal planet\u2014and placed the inside it.</p><br/><p>When his race had been in their prime, something like that wasn\u2019t difficult nor was it a problem.</p><br/><p>But not anymore.</p><br/><p>The simple gift that they had given away was now his only hope.</p><br/><p>A flame that they had given to save the dying race.</p><br/><p>The beings of this planet didn\u2019t have the right to complain if he were to take it away.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s a bit childish to give something and then take it back, but what else can I do\u2026 Anyway, where do I even start?\u2019</p><br/><p>The Nerpa frowned.</p><br/><p>A chaotic planet.</p><br/><p>The only toy he had was a fleet, which had a few ships he couldn\u2019t even use anymore\u2014their engines had overloaded when he destroyed the crystal.</p><br/><p>Although this was more than enough to destroy countless cities and shake an entire nation, that was not enough to go against his enemies.</p><br/><p>According to N-Aroel\u2019s memories, his enemies had built their entire civilization from the .</p><br/><p>They would struggle with every last ounce of their strength to not lose the Flame, which meant that he would have to go against the entire planet.</p><br/><p>\u2018It would\u2019ve been easier if I had the Nelkipa\u2026 tsk.\u2019</p><br/><p>He missed his stolen body and Nelkipa at this point.</p><br/><p>With the Nelkipa, he could easily erase their entire civilization within a day and take over Angkara.</p><br/><p>At least he had stopped Melchizedek and the aliens from taking it over.</p><br/><p>\u2018The fastest way to control the Flame is acquiring the controller.\u2019</p><br/><p>If he could take the three controllers spread around the planet, then he would be able to control the Flame as a whole.</p><br/><p>Game over.</p><br/><p>Although he didn\u2019t have his blue armor or his powerful body, the power to control the Flame was embedded deep inside his soul.</p><br/><p>He would gain the chance to stand up again.</p><br/><p>\u2018It seems our savior has failed\u2026 I must at least try to save our fallen race.\u2019</p><br/><p>The Nerpa thought back to the man who\u2019d left with a heavy burden on his shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>While the Nerpa was heading towards Angkara.</p><br/><p>Hansoo was also heading towards his destination.</p><br/><p>\u2014boom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo smacked away another Abyssal monster and then chuckled at the aura he could feel around him.</p><br/><p>\u2018What to do\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t see them because they were so far away, but he could clearly feel them.</p><br/><p>The people who were watching him from the distance.</p><br/><p>Despite seeing his group for the first time and to still maintain their distance like that, it meant that they knew about Transcendents and how strong they were.</p><br/><p>\u2018They\u2019re used to Transcendents.\u2019</p><br/><p>He could also deduce another thing.</p><br/><p>That the Transcendents inside here were around the 3-Star level.</p><br/><p>If they felt that Hansoo\u2019s power was that of a 2-Star Transcendent, then they wouldn\u2019t be keeping such a long distance from them.</p><br/><p>\u2018At least a 3-Star\u2026 hmm.\u2019</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know how many there were, but they weren\u2019t weaklings.</p><br/><p>As Hansoo looked into the distance\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014kuoooo!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014an aura quickly approached them from the far distance.</p><br/><p>And Kiriel said softly to Hansoo as she felt this:</p><br/><p>\u201cNot quite gentle, huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><br/><p>The being was approaching them at an incredible speed.</p><br/><p>Although the vehicles of Reyunion were easily moving at a speed above 300 km per hour even without the Flame, the mysterious Transcendent easily left those vehicles in the dust as they approached Hansoo\u2019s group.</p><br/><p>The meteor-like being crossed multiple kilometers in an instant and soon arrived before them.</p><br/><p>\u2014boom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The man smiled as he looked at Hansoo and said in greeting:</p><br/><p>\u201cLong time no see, Mr. Hansoo. I\u2019m called John Stone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018...Who? I\u2019ve never seen him before.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo was confused.</p><br/><p>But John Stone whistled as he looked at Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u2018The world really got much better, huh?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo was a being who was so powerful that he couldn\u2019t even imagine his strength in the past.</p><br/><p>With a power so overbearing that being on the same floor as him was unbelievable.</p><br/><p>He shone even more because he used that strength to fight at the very front lines.</p><br/><p>Achieving things nobody could even dream of.</p><br/><p>Back then, he\u2019d thought that Hansoo was mankind\u2019s savior.</p><br/><p>Until he turned the world upside down and disappeared two years ago.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, I\u2019ve gotten much stronger thanks to you.\u2019</p><br/><p>He\u2019d managed to quickly rise up to the 6th Zone and gained a tremendous amount of strength.</p><br/><p>Although Hansoo was stronger than him, he was still confident.</p><br/><p>Intel was more important than strength.</p><br/><p>The reason why Hansoo had been able to lead them was not just because of his strength, but mainly because he knew what to do.</p><br/><p>But not anymore.</p><br/><p>He wouldn\u2019t know anything since he\u2019d just come up.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t Hansoo that was setting up the playing field anymore but him instead.</p><br/><p>\u2018Good. Good.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know what\u2019s going on around here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo chuckled as he looked at the confident John Stone.</p><br/><p>\u2018I can already guess where your confidence comes from, but\u2026 things won\u2019t play out the way you want.\u2019</p><br/><p>Information was important indeed.</p><br/><p>If he was going to speak on his own, then there was no reason to refuse.</p><br/><p>John Stone giggled as he said:</p><br/><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t. If you did\u2026 you wouldn\u2019t be this carefree after knowing that the man you raised has already betrayed you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Heheh.\u2019</p><br/><p>John Stone smiled.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tsk. I knew this would happen. They\u2019re already swarming around them.\u2019</p><br/><p>The Nerpa was at a loss as he looked at the data from inside the Kalkuroun Fleet.</p><br/><p>They had left behind three controllers.</p><br/><p>But flies had already gathered around two of them.</p><br/><p>Especially large flies.</p><br/><p>\u2018One\u2026 is the Neropa Union. Another is the Pompeion Empire\u2026 I see.\u2019</p><br/><p>He\u2019d been initially surprised because the technology should\u2019ve been beyond their comprehension, but it looks like they\u2019d solved a part of it.</p><br/><p>That was probably the reason why the two forces had been able to crush all others.</p><br/><p>Because they had a secret weapon that the others didn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>\u2018I guess this fleet would be nowhere enough.\u2019</p><br/><p>The Nerpa pondered for a moment and then changed his destination.</p><br/><p>\u2018The last one should be easy. The flies around it seem weak enough.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014ooooong\u2014 </p><br/><p>The fleet started to move again.</p><br/><p>Towards the Reyunion\u2019s territory.</p><br/><p>The Flameless Land.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

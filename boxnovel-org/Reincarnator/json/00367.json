Right, they wouldn\u2019t want to fight since there\u2019s just a little bit of time until it\u2019s all over.\u2019</p><br/><p>Kiriel looked at the blue particles surrounding her and their bodies.</p><br/><p>The flower-like, blue droplets were continuously swirling and pulsing as if ready to send them away at a moment\u2019s notice.</p><br/><p>One minute. No, just thirty seconds. They just needed to hold on for thirty seconds\u2014there was no reason for them to risk their lives.</p><br/><p>\u2018Thirty seconds.

Dammit! N-Aroel! What\u2019s going\u2014!\u201d</p><br/><p>At the sudden turn of events, R-Zairon Nell and everyone else spun around.</p><br/><p>They\u2019d thought that N-Aroel had caused this.</p><br/><p>But R-Zairon Nell realized that it wasn\u2019t N-Aroel\u2019s fault after turning around.</p><br/><p>\u2014crackle\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014ssss\u2014 </p><br/><p>She had sliced apart the Quantum Transmission machine.</p><br/><p>The giant tower-like machine had been cut diagonally down the middle, causing the upper segment to slide down.</p><br/><p>And R-Zairon Nell realized what she\u2019d cut.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The faint trace of hope within his mind disappeared with the machine\u2019s destruction.</p><br/><p>As R-Zairon Nell stared at the giant machine in a daze, Kiriel spoke out:</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you, right?\u2019</p><br/><p>All the Dragon God Soldiers fell into despair at this voice.</p><br/><p>And Kiriel shrugged her shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell\u2026 I never said I was going to kill you. After all, we fought together before.\u201d</p><br/><p>The expressions of the Dragon God Soldiers brightened up at these words.</p><br/><p>And it was the same for R-Zairon Nell.</p><br/><p>Seeing a ray of hope, R-Zairon Nell quickly changed his expression and spoke to Kiriel:</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry about that before. Please\u2026 If you let us go, just this once\u2026 the Kalkuroun will never mistreat you..\u201d</p><br/><p>Words that were full of shame, but that didn\u2019t matter.</p><br/><p>Since there was nothing more important than one\u2019s life.</p><br/><p>Even if he had to lick her toes, he had to survive.</p><br/><p>Kiriel chuckled as she said:</p><br/><p>\u201cSure. Let\u2019s just go our separate ways.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...Where are you going? You aren\u2019t going with us?\u2019</p><br/><p>Kiriel smirked at R-Zairon Nell\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I have a comrade. Good luck.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWha\u2026 NOO!\u201d</p><br/><p>If Kiriel disappeared like this, then it was over for them.</p><br/><p>R-Zairon Nell freaked out and screamed, but it was of no use.</p><br/><p>Since Kiriel had already disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u2014booooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Even before R-Zairon Nell\u2019s screams reached the place she\u2019d been standing on, she had already left.</p><br/><p>\u201cKeke\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKaa\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The Quirae, who had flinched at the sudden appearance of the blue particles, started slowly moving towards them again.</p><br/><p>Towards the Dragon God Soldiers who were already exhausted from internal struggles and no longer had an escape path.</p><br/><p>\u201c...Damn.\u2019</p><br/><p>It would\u2019ve been better to die at Kiriel\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>The Dragon God Soldier\u2019s expressions were filled with despair and fear as the swarms of Quirae, covering the whole horizon in their entirety, charged towards them.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo smiled as he looked at the blue particles disappearing while he smashed a Quirae away.</p><br/><p>\u2018She succeeded.\u2019</p><br/><p>The Quantum Transmission had stopped.</p><br/><p>Everything had returned to plan.</p><br/><p>He just needed to defeat his opponent and move up.</p><br/><p>The Mjolnir swung even more powerfully as if it had read Hansoo\u2019s thoughts.</p><br/><p>At that moment\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014crack!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014a sound of something breaking rang out from inside him.</p><br/><p>The consciousness of the seed, which had stayed silent for most of the time it had been inside his body, spoke to him with worry.</p><br/><p>Its power was an immortal\u2019s rate of recovery.</p><br/><p>Meaning that if he needed its strength, then his life was possibly in danger, and his body crushed apart.</p><br/><p>A strength that was better the less one used it.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo couldn\u2019t respond to it anyway.</p><br/><p>Since he had fallen into silence.</p><br/><p>And as if the Quirae had sensed the changes inside his body, they charged forward to rip him apart. </p><br/><p>But they couldn\u2019t stop the change anymore.</p><br/><p>Something similar to what had happened to Kiriel just now, but more natural, started to rush through his insides.</p><br/><p>If Kiriel\u2019s change was that of forcefully hacking apart something forbidden, Hansoo\u2019s change was the exact opposite.</p><br/><p>He knew what he needed\u2014he excavated it from the seed and proceeded to the next step.</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s destroyed body then started to recover at an insane rate.</p><br/><p>The Quirae charged at him like countless moths to a flame, and Hansoo smashed them apart as he got accustomed to his changing body.</p><br/><p>And then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014boooooooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014the sound of something exploding reverberated from inside his body.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201c...What a crazy world.

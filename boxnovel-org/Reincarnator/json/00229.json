It did indeed blow up a year earlier but it\u2019s not that bad.\u2019</p><br/><p>Chaos could cause danger but it could also be an opportunity.</p><br/><p>If he could achieve his goals from this chaos then what Clementine\u2019s forces had done would\u2019ve just helped him.</p><br/><p>Hansoo finished his thoughts and then shouted while looking at the 5m-wide azure marble.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful with your words just in case after you jump in!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>The people made confused expressions but even before they could ask, Hansoo jumped in.</p><br/><p>Towards the entrance down to the 2nd floor.</p><br/><p>And the people who were watching this grinded their teeth as they followed Hansoo in one by one.</p><br/><p>Whoooosh!</p><br/><p>Whoosh!</p><br/><p>And soon.</p><br/><p>The azure marble absorbed all those people and these tens of people disappeared from the 1st floor of the maze without a single trace.</p><br/><p>The infected soldiers only screamed at the disappearance of these people, they didn\u2019t have any thoughts of chasing them.</p><br/><p>Then they started to split up to oversee other parts of the maze and silence filled the area around the marble.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Whooooosh!</p><br/><p>\u2018Ugh...This doesn\u2019t really feel that great.\u2019</p><br/><p>As Christopher frowned at the sensation of sticky liquids swirling around his body.</p><br/><p>Whooooosh!</p><br/><p>\u201cHuupp!\u201d</p><br/><p>Christopher\u2019s body popped out from the marble and floated up into the air.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m out!\u2019</p><br/><p>Christopher found his balance in mid air as he lightly landed onto the ground.</p><br/><p>Then the words of Hansoo came into Christopher\u2019s ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are my comrades.\u201d</p><br/><p>Christopher tensed up at Hansoo\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Others?\u2019</p><br/><p>And as he looked around he saw hundreds of people watching him.</p><br/><p>He was shocked.</p><br/><p>\u2018So this is what he meant by being careful with our words\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>The players who had been hunting in the 2nd floor started to throw questions at Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this? What happened above?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck! I can\u2019t communicate with my friend who went up!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard the infected soldiers revived?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo shook his head at these questions.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t know very well as well. I hurriedly ran down here with my friends. We were resupplying in the supply zone and this had happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The people then started to talk between themselves.</p><br/><p>\u201cShit...Did the gem recover?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope somebody can just smash it apart.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYo? Do you wanna try it out? We might get a ton of rewards for breaking it. The ones who broke it first got a lot too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa. You want to get killed huh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Christopher felt the difference between him and these players once again as he listened to them.</p><br/><p>For him and others, it was a deathly crisis.</p><br/><p>But for them it was a chance that they might take.</p><br/><p>The people then spoke to Hansoo again.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to join hands and go up, how about you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo replied instantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have friends below. We had split up to resupply.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh then\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to go down. Well\u2026 We didn\u2019t have the time to get our bags because of the chaos but we still have to go help them.\u201d</p><br/><p>The players who had been looking at Hansoo\u2019s group suspiciously then started to look away.</p><br/><p>They were wondering why these guys were moving around in a small group but such cases were possible.</p><br/><p>Actually, it was common for a small group to rejoin after resupplying with potions and other necessities while the larger group held a spot below.</p><br/><p>This was because the damned game didn\u2019t provide inventory and made everyone carry bags.</p><br/><p>The players started to lose interest and said their goodbyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell. Stay strong. We\u2019ll just do a quest or two if we get the chance to on the way then!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh. This is annoying. I used all my extra revival scrolls below.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing bad about it. There\u2019ll be more quests above so come on.\u201d</p><br/><p>The players started to head towards the marble leading back up casually one by one.</p><br/><p>And Christopher\u2019s underlings started to fall down one by one as if they finally started to relax.</p><br/><p>They had been too tensed up from all that had happened.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fucking hell. A mafia game* where we die if we get caught.\u2019</p><br/><p>Ellenoia, Christopher\u2019s right hand, breathed in and out and asked Hansoo while she calmed herself down.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do we even have to go down while doing all this? What\u2019s below\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Though Christopher\u2019s group was following Hansoo, Ellenoia still didn\u2019t understand why Hansoo was going down like this.</p><br/><p>She had gathered a large amount of information when she had first come to this world.</p><br/><p>Since that was what she had done before anyway.</p><br/><p>People found the hidden race and could receive Protection Elixirs from them.</p><br/><p>It was a small but huge change.</p><br/><p>Since this gave people the chance to acquire the godly item, .</p><br/><p>But there were not many reasons for them to go down.</p><br/><p>Since they could just accomplish quests from other places and buy the Protection Elixirs with gold.</p><br/><p>As Hansoo heard Ellenoia\u2019s words, he decided to let these people understand to a degree.</p><br/><p>To a degree.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy trait is for something like this. I can feel it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ve never been wrong until now.\u201d</p><br/><p>A strange expression appeared on Ellenoia\u2019s face but then soon disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cPhew\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ellenoia sighed out loud.</p><br/><p>If somebody else told her such things and tried to take her down to the depths of hell then she might\u2019ve smashed their face in.</p><br/><p>But she had already heard the crazy things that man had said and had accomplished after them.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, we don\u2019t really have a choice anyway\u2026.Well, he really has a lot of fascinating things about him.\u2019</p><br/><p>As Ellenoia watched Hansoo with a strange expression.</p><br/><p>Ooooong!</p><br/><p>The marble trembled and the people who had gone in came back out.</p><br/><p>While cursing with nervous expressions.</p><br/><p>\u201cFucking hell!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ellenoia made a shocked expression as she saw the hundreds of people coming back out from the marble.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why did they come back like this? With such shocked expressions? Did something happen other than what we know about?\u2019</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that strange for something else to happen.</p><br/><p>Since the moment the infected soldiers appeared, the land above had turned into a mysterious land.</p><br/><p>Ellenoia asked the group who had jumped out.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell you see\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>But before the player could even answer.</p><br/><p>Crunch!</p><br/><p>A spear flew out from Hansoo\u2019s hand and pierced the player\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>Ellenoia shouted at Hansoo\u2019s actions from shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Why the hell did he attack first!\u2019</p><br/><p>Though they had been found out already, the time for the information to propagate was another story.</p><br/><p>Like how they had been successful at hiding their identities just now.</p><br/><p>Collisions were better the less there were but for Hansoo to suddenly attack like that.</p><br/><p>Hansoo tsked and replied at Ellenoia\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been caught already.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Ellenoia looked around.</p><br/><p>The hundreds of players who had come back down cursed out loud.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh, fucking bastard\u2019s quite quick isn\u2019t he.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamned bug players. Isn\u2019t this a hack as well? We really need to get rid of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Christopher and Ellenoia were shocked at the news.</p><br/><p>Hansoo mumbled inwardly.</p><br/><p>\u2018...They acted faster than I expected huh. On the blacklist already.\u2019</p><br/><p>Blacklist.</p><br/><p>A kill list managed by the bug killer clan, .</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Oooooong.</p><br/><p>Bright red powder started to gather around Hansoo\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>*For those who don\u2019t know what the mafia game is : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)</p><br/>\n</div>"}

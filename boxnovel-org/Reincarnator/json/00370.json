I don\u2019t know where your dream started and ended, but\u2026 What you\u2019re seeing now is the reality. Wake up, Enbi Arin!\u201d</p><br/><p>And as she heard these words, something started to twist in her head.</p><br/><p>The sudden reality caused her to doubt her own memories\u2014that there was something not quite right.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo continued to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf your memory was that of happiness and of things being easy then\u2026 that was all a lie.

I must go. I need to repay this debt as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>She could not let those who had played around with her just roam around freely.</p><br/><p>She could part with Hansoo after that if she really felt like it.</p><br/><p>\u2018Thank you for allowing me to rest properly. In return\u2026 I\u2019ll allow you to rest for all eternity.\u2019</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin spoke to Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to go up, then I\u2019ll guide you from here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Confused, Kiriel asked:</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know this place well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. I fought with them for a long time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cutting away the fifteen years and focusing on her memories of Aokan, she started to remember everything in detail.</p><br/><p>The ones who she\u2019d fought against.</p><br/><p>It had been fifteen years in her dreams, but only a moment in reality.</p><br/><p>Her information should be helpful.</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded and stood up.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s confirm one thing before we go up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cConfirm?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo chuckled.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. When I was about to open a treasure chest, \u2018somebody\u2019 caused a damn scene.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...You bastard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiriel giggled at Enbi Arin and then asked Hansoo:</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking about that place below, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded as he looked towards the bright blue hole in the distance.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThe sounds have stopped. It seems that their fight has ended.\u201d</p><br/><p>N-Akuon, who had been listening to N-Aroel, mumbled as he looked at the now silent Aoken.</p><br/><p>It looked like the matters below had been wrapped up.</p><br/><p>But N-Akuon quickly shook his head and focused on N-Aroel.</p><br/><p>Aokan was something the fleet would handle.</p><br/><p>For a researcher like him, this was much more interesting.</p><br/><p>\u2018...That can was more insane than we imagined.\u2019</p><br/><p>N-Akuon thought of Melchizedek and asked N-Aroel:</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, is that it? Where\u2019s the fun part?\u201d</p><br/><p>N-Aroel shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm. The second story is\u2026 the race I told you about before.\u201d</p><br/><p>N-Aroel pointed towards Aokan below and spoke.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

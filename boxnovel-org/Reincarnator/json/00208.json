Are you crazy! Heyy! You don\u2019t even have skills!\u201d</p><br/><p>Due to it\u2019s size, though it looked like the Garmeia was right in front of them there was at least a kilometer of space between them and the fortress.</p><br/><p>And for him to jump into such a strange place.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fuck! Is he that hurried?\u2019</p><br/><p>Karhal made a flustered expression.</p><br/><p>He knew that something strange happened.</p><br/><p>But they had the Satellite Fortresses, what was there to worry about?</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know what the hell that was but tens of the Satellite Fortresses being destroyed was something that was unthinkable.</p><br/><p>Hansoo jumped up into the sky as he shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to follow so just support me with long range attacks!\u201d</p><br/><p>He had jumped in because he could only do close range fighting but there was no need for others, who could attack from afar, to jump in.</p><br/><p>As those words were heard.</p><br/><p>The people, who were making suspicious expressions, started to pour out a multitude of attacks.</p><br/><p>Rumble!</p><br/><p>Kuuuurrururng!</p><br/><p>The Satellite Fortresses standing outside the Garmeia\u2019s range started to slowly approach the giant silver creature.</p><br/><p>The Lord had started to control the clansmen and were moving the Satellite Fortress after receiving Hansoo\u2019s orders.</p><br/><p>If the Garmeia had stopped for now, this was the chance to attack it without being counterattacked.</p><br/><p>Karhal nodded as he watched this scene.</p><br/><p>\u2018Good!\u2019</p><br/><p>He understood that the Garmeia had a huge size.</p><br/><p>The thousands of tentacles that were birthed from the sea were now crossing over each other and covering the Satellite Fortress.</p><br/><p>The thing that was eating up the 1km-wide Satellite Fortress was easily over 3km-wide.</p><br/><p>From the scene of this giant thing eating up the Satellite Fortress, it looked like a giant egg was being created by wrapping a fishing line around the fortress.</p><br/><p>But the Satellite Fortress could easily blow up something even larger than that.</p><br/><p>No, even a human could.</p><br/><p>If they threw tens of thousands of skills then any mountain would eventually disappear.</p><br/><p>Rumble. Urrrrng!</p><br/><p>The countless skills started to turn the strange organism into a sea of flames.</p><br/><p>Shining lights, tremendous noises and dustclouds started to cover up the Satellite Fortress.</p><br/><p>At the same time.</p><br/><p>Karhal didn\u2019t prepare his Quintuple Beam and instead shot an arrow towards Hansoo.</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>The arrow started to drop as it traveled and it headed towards Hansoo\u2019s foot.</p><br/><p>Crunch!</p><br/><p>The arrow perfectly supported Hansoo as he slowly fell and Hansoo jumped up with it as a foothold.</p><br/><p>\u2018Good. It wouldn\u2019t be hard if we continue at this rate.\u2019</p><br/><p>Karhal readied his second arrow and then nodded towards Hansoo who had jumped up.</p><br/><p>Toooong!</p><br/><p>Hansoo was getting closer to the Satellite Fortress after jumping off the arrow Karhal shot out.</p><br/><p>Wave</p><br/><p>A change occurred in the beast that was swallowing up the giant Satellite Fortress.</p><br/><p>The surfaces of the thousands of tentacles melted down with a loud noise, reconstructed themselves and created a whole new structure.</p><br/><p>Eye.</p><br/><p>Hundreds of eyes appeared on each tentacle as they glared at every direction.</p><br/><p>The hundreds of thousands of eyes stared at the countless people surrounding it one by one.</p><br/><p>Others couldn\u2019t see it but Hansoo, who was closer to the beast, could see all of the changes occurring.</p><br/><p>Hansoo hurriedly moved the Forked Lightning in front of him and then rolled his body into a ball.</p><br/><p>He then shouted out loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrepare for impact! An attack is coming in!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t understand the situation but Hansoo\u2019s loud shout had a certain amount of impact on these people.</p><br/><p>Everyone, even without knowing what the hell was going on, canceled all their attacking skills and replaced them with defensive skills and got into defensive positions.</p><br/><p>As Hansoo\u2019s shout died off.</p><br/><p>Paaaaaak!</p><br/><p>Hundreds of tentacles spread out.</p><br/><p>Towards the people by the shore.</p><br/><p>Booom!</p><br/><p>Booooooom!</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>\u201cAaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>The tips of the tentacles changed their shapes into spears, swords and axes as they smashed into people.</p><br/><p>The adventurers were quite strong but the power of the tentacles were quite formidable as well.</p><br/><p>If Hansoo hadn\u2019t warned them then they might\u2019ve lost a limb or might have even died.</p><br/><p>The adventurers freaked out at the force of the impact as they backed off in numerous directions.</p><br/><p>Since they might die if they stood where they were.</p><br/><p>Chuurrrrrrk</p><br/><p>Thankfully the strange beast stopped its attacks as the adventurers backed off, retracted its tentacles and then focused on gathering in the energy again.</p><br/><p>As if time was precious to it.</p><br/><p>But as Karhal, who had received a large hole in the armor by his chest, was about to sigh as he watched the tentacles heading back.</p><br/><p>Something came up inside Karhal\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fuck! What about Hansoo?\u2019</p><br/><p>They had escaped the attack range but Hansoo could not.</p><br/><p>As if his worries were for naught.</p><br/><p>Booom!</p><br/><p>Boooooom!</p><br/><p>Countless noises of explosions were heard from somewhere near the Satellite Fortress covered in clouds.</p><br/><p>Crunch!</p><br/><p>Crrruuuunnch!</p><br/><p>\u2018Holy shit. That fucking monster.\u2019</p><br/><p>Karhal was dumbfounded at the scene he saw after the smoke faded away.</p><br/><p>The tentacles that they could barely handle.</p><br/><p>Hansoo smashed, snapped and destroyed hundreds of those tentacles and continued to advance forward.</p><br/><p>Everytime the golden spear shone in mid air, the tentacles got destroyed as a path was created.</p><br/><p>But a single man could not deal with an army.</p><br/><p>Uuuduuddk!</p><br/><p>Kuuududuuk!</p><br/><p>The tentacles that had receded away from the adventurers all started to head towards Hansoo.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo was already almost at his goal.</p><br/><p>Whoosh!</p><br/><p>Hansoo, who had approached the wall of the beast, found an open spot between the tentacles and headed in.</p><br/><p>Thankfully the tentacles stopped attacking as if they didn\u2019t want to attack the insides.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Sssss</p><br/><p>The strange beast closed its eyes, spread out its tentacles and continued to eat up the Satellite Fortress and the mana engine inside it.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is it really just eating it?\u2019</p><br/><p>Karhal mumbled as he looked at the beast which was covering the Satellite Fortress too gently to call it eating.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ugh. This isn\u2019t important.\u2019</p><br/><p>Karhal sighed and then made an expression of despair.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck\u2026What the hell do we do now?\u201d</p><br/><p>With their strength they would just get shredded apart so getting close to it was an issue in itself.</p><br/><p>And they couldn\u2019t use the Destruction Jade while the Sages existed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yeah. We should just call reinforcements and\u2026 Trust in the Satellite Fortresses.\u2019</p><br/><p>Karhal looked towards the Satellite Fortresses coming his way.</p><br/><p>Karhal mumbled that although they weren\u2019t able to, the Satellite Fortresses, which could fire a tremendous amount of power, could easily melt that beast down.</p><br/><p>As Karhal and the others sat upon the ground and stared at the Satellite Fortress to relax.</p><br/><p>Rrrriiippp</p><br/><p>The air started to split apart.</p><br/><p>And the people freaked out even more than when the giant beast had appeared as they saw this.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why is the Fairy here!\u2019</p><br/><p>Karhal freaked out as well.</p><br/><p>It had been 9 years since he had last seen the Fairy.</p><br/><p>Since the Fairy hadn\u2019t appeared in front of them ever since the tutorial ended.</p><br/><p>Tremble Tremble\u2026</p><br/><p>Karhal\u2019s hand started to shake from fear.</p><br/><p>Though the Fairies themselves didn\u2019t harm them, their appearance almost symbolized a disaster.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why the hell is it here\u2026.\u2019</p><br/><p>A chill went down his spine.</p><br/><p>It hadn\u2019t appeared when the Higher Races ruled over humans as slaves and lowered their numbers but it had appeared now.</p><br/><p>After that mysterious tentacle monster appeared.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is that thing a bigger threat than the Higher Races\u2026.\u2019</p><br/><p>Even before Karhal finished his line of thought.</p><br/><p>The Fairy opened its small mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha! Hey everyone! What a disaster! I don\u2019t know how that thing woke up.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fairy laughed in joy.</p><br/><p>Since that thing couldn\u2019t have woken up logically.</p><br/><p>The Satellite Fortress that had a stealth coating so that the Higher Races or the Sages couldn\u2019t find it.</p><br/><p>The humans could find it but it had a mana barrier that humans could not get through.</p><br/><p>And El-Tara that humans wouldn\u2019t be able to beat without mana.</p><br/><p>One required a tremendous amount of luck and persistence in order to wake that thing up.</p><br/><p>No, they needed more.</p><br/><p>The Fairy was extremely happy from this situation, which required a tremendous amount of luck and effort to happen, blowing up.</p><br/><p>\u2018These guys need to try harder for this.\u2019</p><br/><p>The Fairy finished its thoughts, spun around the air and then spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a mission for your entire Race. You guys now need to kill this thing. I\u2019ll think of a reward after you kill it. The reward will be proportional to your efforts so try your best!\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed like the Fairy was shouting into nowhere but that wasn\u2019t the case.</p><br/><p>The Fairy\u2019s voice rang into everyone\u2019s ears in the entire Zone.</p><br/><p>Hansoo could probably hear it inside the Satellite Fortress as well.</p><br/><p>And Karhal looked at the beast in front of his eyes after he heard those words.</p><br/><p>Ooooooon!</p><br/><p>The Satellite Fortresses that they had waited for had arrived above their heads.</p><br/><p>Six, disregarding the one that had fell before.</p><br/><p>The people gulped at the tremendous amount of pressure these Fortresses emitted.</p><br/><p>And soon.</p><br/><p>Kiiiiing!</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s expressions brightened up as they saw the blue light gathering upon the weapons in front of the Satellite Fortress.</p><br/><p>The scenes they had seen caused by the Satellite Fortresses were too amazing for them to lose hope here.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo\u2019s spear alone had been enougb to destroy those tentacles.</p><br/><p>Even if Hansoo\u2019s power was strong, it was nowhere close to the Satellite Fortress\u2019s attacks they thought.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yeah\u2026This\u2019ll do.\u2019</p><br/><p>As the people looked at the Satellite Fortresses with hope-filled eyes.</p><br/><p>Paaaat!</p><br/><p>And as if it was fulfilling their hopes, the blue light that had gathered in front of the Satellite Fortress charged out towards the beast.</p><br/><p>But right before the beams were about to smash onto the egg.</p><br/><p>Piiiiing!</p><br/><p>A blue energy surrounded the egg.</p><br/><p>A very deep blue light that couldn\u2019t even be compared to that of the Satellite Fortress.</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>Zooooom!</p><br/><p>The blue lights collided into the deep blue light of the egg and got refracted into numerous directions.</p><br/><p>Like a stream of water hitting a wall.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026You want us to kill that thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>The people were dumbfounded as they stared at the egg that hadn\u2019t even gotten a scratch from the attacks of the Satellite Fortresses.</p><br/><p>Crack!</p><br/><p>Suddenly a crack rang down the surface of the egg.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>The people looked at the crack in the egg with surprise.</p><br/><p>Thinking that the Satellite Fortress hadn\u2019t disappointed them.</p><br/><p>But this sensation only lasted a moment.</p><br/><p>Swooosh.</p><br/><p>An eye.</p><br/><p>A humongous eye.</p><br/><p>The people lost strength in their legs as their gazes met the eye of the giant thing inside the egg looking through the crack.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hansoo\u2026What the hell do we do now\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Karhal thought of Hansoo inside that strange beast and mumbled.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Metiron, who had his hands over the strange marble in the empty room, was constantly conversing with someone.</p><br/><p>As if he had gone crazy.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? This thing\u2019s name is Gael-Tara? Why did you make it?\u201d</p><br/><p>&lt;\u2026&gt;</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm. Revenge is nice. Holding onto your emotions becomes toxic. You need to let it loose.\u201d</p><br/><p>&lt;\u2026&gt;</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. Good. It\u2019s not hard to fulfill your wishes but\u2026I can do some of my work too right?\u2019</p><br/><p>The blue marbles in front of Metiron vibrated slightly at his words.</p><br/><p>Ooooong</p><br/><p>\u201cOh I can do whatever I want? Hehe, that\u2019s what I thought. Oh..Those things are even better than the Mana Pool?\u201d</p><br/><p>Metiron, who had his hand over the marble, smiled towards the small thing inside the aquarium surrounding the room.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

If he was truly normal, he wouldn't have given the control of his heart to his enemies.</p><br/><p>Thump! Thump!</p><br/><p>Through the hole in Pompeion's chest that his hand had gone into, he could feel the heart thumping clearly. It wasn't that he had defeated Pompeion and grasped his heart, but this was simply the agreement that Pompeion and the three clan heads had reached.</p><br/><p>&lt;i will=\"\" give=\"\" you=\"\" the=\"\" right=\"\" to=\"\" destroy=\"\" my=\"\" heart=\"\" whenever.=\"\" so\u2026=\"\" don't=\"\" worry=\"\" about=\"\" being=\"\" attacked=\"\" from=\"\" behind=\"\" and=\"\" focus=\"\" everything=\"\" onto=\"\" the=\"\" fight=\"\" below.=\"\"&gt;</p><br/><p>This was an agreement that gave them no disadvantages.</p><br/><p>Pompeion's heart, whose life was naturally in their hands, would use all of his power so that it wouldn't burst, and since he couldn't scheme, they would be able to attack and focus on the fight below free of thought.</p><br/><p>And the result.</p><br/><p>Boooooooooooom!</p><br/><p>Kakakakaka!</p><br/><p>An even more intense torrent of flames rained down from the heavens. The remaining ships used all the energy they had without holding back and fired below.</p><br/><p>Boooooooooooooom!</p><br/><p>A terrifying amount of flames exploded from Pompeion. Specifically, it was from the Flame fragment that was inside Pompeion. The explosion was strong enough to easily overwhelm all three clan heads.</p><br/><p>'This bastard\u2026 he really was holding back!'</p><br/><p>Cold sweat ran down K-Merrow Nell's back. To scheme in front of a guy that possessed such power, it was certain that if they had lost control and attacked, it would be them that would have died in his hands.</p><br/><p>K-merrow Nell, who wore a grim expression, suddenly smiled.</p><br/><p>'No, no. This is great.'</p><br/><p>If the blade was sharp, it would have been threatening, but now, the blade was in their hands. They held Pompeion's heart in their hands, so that was good.</p><br/><p>'Once we destroy the man below at this rate\u2026 we'll manipulate Pompeion to deal with Hansoo.'</p><br/><p>Hansoo was currently withstanding all of the attacks and blows of this enormous energy, so it was certain that his body would not leave this battle unscathed.</p><br/><p>Then, it wouldn't be difficult to subdue him.</p><br/><p>The reason why they were so afraid to begin with was that Hansoo might attack them after he recovered his condition while they were dealing with Pompeion after this fight. This was even easier to achieve with a comrade that could teleport.</p><br/><p>However, as long as Pompeion was under their control, the story would be simpler. They just needed to use their remaining strength to kill him. It didn't matter if he run since he would be somewhere on this planet.</p><br/><p>'Even if he ascends, that is fine as well.'</p><br/><p>K-Merrow Nell smiled. The situation was quite amusing. The three of them were simultaneously holding Pompeion's heart in fear of losing out to the other two. If one of them had Pompeion's heart and used it to attack the other two, the situation would turn for the worse, but if it was like that, then everything would be fine.</p><br/><p>'In the end\u2026 the one who is scared first is the one that loses.'</p><br/><p>K-Merrow Nell laughed.</p><br/><p>The one that become scared and retreated first would be the one to lose. Looking at the circumstances of Pompeion, he had retreated one step back, and now he was in this state.</p><br/><p>'I'd rather die than have this happen to me.'</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Ruuuumble!</p><br/><p>An even more intense, eerie sound rang out from below. It was different from the sounds of the previous energy collision they had heard.</p><br/><p>As K-Merrow Nell and the other two clan heads heard and felt the shockwaves, they knew this battle was over.</p><br/><p>It was the sound of the man being shoved deep into the ground.</p><br/><p>If the man had a hidden card, he wouldn't have held it up to this point, so it was the aftershocks of the final struggle.</p><br/><p>Booooooooooom!</p><br/><p>[Ah damn! Hansoo!!]</p><br/><p>[What! What the hell is happening?!]</p><br/><p>The terrified voices of the humans could be heard over the communications device. That was how powerful the shockwave was, which was enough to turn everything below to dust, making K-Merrow Nell feel better.</p><br/><p>'The heavens are helping.'</p><br/><p>If those two were swept away by that explosion, then they wouldn't have to deal with them since they would die on their own. But it wiykd be optimal if things were certain.</p><br/><p>Thump! Thump!</p><br/><p>K-Merrow Nell smiled as he felt the heartbeat of Pompeion, which was pleasantly beating at his fingertips.</p><br/><p>\"Well. Well. It seems things are finished below\u2026 so be prepared, Pompeion.\"</p><br/><p>K-Merrow Nell gently applied some pressure on the heart, which was a fragile organ that could be blown apart from a bit of pressure. Their strength came from their souls, which gave them the authority to wield the Flame, so their bodies were naturally weaker.</p><br/><p>\"Finish them for us\u2026 with your hands.\"</p><br/><p>Pompeion smiled coldly as he stared in their eyes.</p><br/><p>'Yes, it is time to finish things.'</p><br/><p>\u2026 In order to finish the preparation that he and the man had done sowing the seeds.</p><br/><p>'Still\u2026 it is somewhat frightening to be in this kind of situation.'</p><br/><p>Pompeion felt his heartbeat as he prepared himself, mumbling.</p><br/><p>Due to this, the heart in the three clan heads' hands beat faster.</p><br/><p>Misunderstanding this as fear, the three clan heads smiled. However, Pompeion simply smiled back.</p><br/><p>'Well. At least\u2026 there's three guys that will go with me.'</p><br/><p>They were going to die anyways, so it was better for them to know at least why.</p><br/><p>Pompeion looked at K-Merrow Nell who was smiling the brightest.</p><br/><p>\"You guys may not know, but I had met that alien a bit earlier.\"</p><br/><p>\"\u2026 What nonsense are you saying? Do your job!\"</p><br/><p>Puchi!</p><br/><p>K-Merrow Nell felt something was awry from Pompeion's words and stabbed the heart with his thumbnail, but Pompeion didn't even flinch. He only continued to speak.</p><br/><p>\"He gave half of his soul as a token of trust. Maybe that's the only way he thought that could earn my trust. It was the same for you as well, right?\"</p><br/><p>The three clan heads halted and nodded. It was exactly as he had said. Right now, half of the man's soul was within Pompeion's body, and the other half was split between the three of them. This was why they had made a contract with the man because they believed they could kill the man whenever.</p><br/><p>However, Pompeion chuckled and remarked, \"But isn't that strange? His soul is the symbol of strength, and yet he parted away from it so easily?\"</p><br/><p>At the words of Pompeion, the three clan heads frowned. It was strange. There were much better alternatives to make contracts, but this had placed the worst conditions on himself. The man had nothing to gain. </p><br/><p>\"You guys only have a sixth of the soul, but I have a bit of his memories as well due to receiving half.\"</p><br/><p>Among them, it was the method of reproduction of his race, Parasitic Soul. It would detach part of their soul and embed it in another race's soul. It didn't matter what race or how large of the soul was a part. Even a tiny portion of the soul would be fine.</p><br/><p>Once the person accepted his soul, the condition would be satisfied. The opponent's race would gain the ability to use power and technology at a terrifying level. As a result, they would continue to use it again and again, intoxicated by their newfound strength. It would continue to grow when used, whether it is a tenth or half of the soul.</p><br/><p>If the spirit grew up enough to be able to reach its original state\u2026 If the soul was capable of forming the original owner of this soul\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Then the embedded soul pushes the original owner of the body out and takes control.\"</p><br/><p>Once the original soul changes, that race would not be the same as before, since both personalities and goals would change.</p><br/><p>This was a complete parasitic species, grown from the seeds that were planted by that soul.</p><br/><p>\"That's what they are. That was how the fake Neropa grew up.\"</p><br/><p>\"This crazy\u2026\"</p><br/><p>They finally understood why that man had formed such a disadvantageous contract. He hadn't chosen death, but rather the reproduction of his race.</p><br/><p>It was only a matter of time before a second and third version of the man would appear.</p><br/><p>\"Let's\u2026 go.\"</p><br/><p>Simultaneously.</p><br/><p>Booooooooooooooom!</p><br/><p>A great amount of energy surged within Pompeion's body, spiralling crazily. The soul inside him started to overload, causing the three clan heads to freak out.</p><br/><p>Ukatan Pael and the other clan heads, who were witnessing this, screamed, \"You crazy bastard! I\u2026 I don't want to die!\"</p><br/><p>\"Ahhhhhhhhk! You bastard!\"</p><br/><p>Kacha!</p><br/><p>Pompeion coughed out blood. He felt his heart get crushed under the angered expression of Ukatan Pael's face, and he saw K-Merrow Nell and Adelaia Ron curse and run off, but it didn't matter\u2014he had used every bit of strength to make himself a bomb.</p><br/><p>None of the struggle, even from those attempting to shield their bodies, would matter. This was because the bomb within him was more than sufficient to achieve his last objective. The explosiveness of this bomb was enough to burn away these three raccoons that unknowingly scurried in.</p><br/><p>That included the seeds planted within them as well.</p><br/><p>'Sangjin. My friend. Be well. I'm sorry\u2026'</p><br/><p>There was nothing he regretted as his plans progressed except for one event.</p><br/><p>'Well. Nothing can be done for both of us.'</p><br/><p>With one last bitter smile\u2026</p><br/><p>Booooooooooooooooom!</p><br/><p>A massive explosion centered around Pompeion's body engulfed the surrounding area.</p><br/><p>'You idiots! I told you\u2026 not to come!\"</p><br/><p>A few people could be seen dimly as they jumped out from the cloud: Sanjin, Mihee, Kiriel, and Samuel.</p><br/><p>Sssssssssssssss!</p><br/><p>The remnants of the Flame rushed toward them.</p><br/><p>\"Eeeeeeeeeeeek!\"</p><br/><p>Kiriel clenched her teeth seeing the enormous wave of energy heading toward her.</p><br/><p>She had recklessly left in order to save him, but this was far more than what she had expected.</p><br/><p>'He was enduring all of this?'</p><br/><p>At this rate, she would melt before she could use her skill again.</p><br/><p>At that moment\u2026</p><br/><p>Whoooooooosh!</p><br/><p>\u2026 The Flame's power died down.</p><br/><p>'What the\u2026?'</p><br/><p>While Kiriel was shocked from this scene.</p><br/><p>Sangjin spoke hurriedly with a contorted face, \"I can't hold on for long! Hurry\u2026 go away!\"</p><br/><p>\"You\u2026 how are you doing this?\"</p><br/><p>Sangjin, who was blocking the flames, mumbled bitterly from those words.</p><br/><p>\"I have\u2026 it as well.\"</p><br/><p>Inside Sangjin's body\u2026</p><br/><p>Kiiiiing!</p><br/><p>The last seed of Angkara shook violently.</p><br/><p>&lt;/i&gt;</p><br/>\n</div>"}

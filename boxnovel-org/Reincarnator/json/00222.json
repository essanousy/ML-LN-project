They caused too many eyes to focus on them.\u2019</p><br/><p>The entire Level 1 Supply Zone was in a ruckus.</p><br/><p>The countless people who had come in to get the expensive Protection Elixirs.</p><br/><p>This was how enticing these bug players were.</p><br/><p>Though not all these people will go crazy in order to kill them but things will still become dirty if he went to help them now.</p><br/><p>\u2018I can only pray that they\u2019re lucky. I need to focus on my work first.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo expression remained still as he just went inside.</p><br/><p>Kameira asked Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to go get them? It\u2019ll be a jackpot if you kill them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Most bug players were strong enough to destroy normal players.</p><br/><p>Since their controls were much different than them.</p><br/><p>Though these people were going crazy, if they met the bug players while roaming around in small parties the ones killed would not be the bug players but them instead.</p><br/><p>If they weren\u2019t like the Bug Killers who had professional PK items, it would be hard to deal with them.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo was even stronger than them.</p><br/><p>There was a reason why Kameira wasn\u2019t chasing them.</p><br/><p>Because she could get smashed apart the moment she saw them and get logged out.</p><br/><p>Though she would revive, not being able to log in for an entire day was annoying.</p><br/><p>Hansoo shrugged his shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot very interested. And it\u2019s not like I\u2019ll find them even if I searched for them. It\u2019s better to just get Protection Elixirs in that time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kameira nodded.</p><br/><p>They were like lottos.</p><br/><p>Unless they were Bug killers, it was better for them to just do what they had been doing.</p><br/><p>Kameira then finished her thoughts and then looked at Hansoo suspiciously.</p><br/><p>\u2018Isn\u2019t this guy a bug player as well?\u2019</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t have a single ounce of gold and had amazing control, she questioned for a moment but then shook his head.</p><br/><p>There was nothing in his movements that told her that he was a bug players.</p><br/><p>And it might be different for other places but there were plenty of people like Hansoo in the War Fortress.</p><br/><p>Since the strong people of various locations heard the rumors and had sold everything for the warp gate fees in order to come here.</p><br/><p>Hansoo saw Kameira\u2019s expression and then mumbled inwardly.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019ll become tedious if I show more skill than what I\u2019ve shown.\u2019</p><br/><p>Though he wouldn\u2019t hesitate when he would need to accomplish something, he thought to himself that he would control himself better from now on.</p><br/><p>As Hansoo continued in, he had arrived at a large area with an altar in the middle after passing through the tunnel.</p><br/><p>This altar, which had a large gemstone on the top of it, was the proof that the players had taken over this Maze in the past.</p><br/><p>Since hundreds of thousands of corpse soldiers spawned and attacked the players as that gemstone shone.</p><br/><p>Though the gem, which had been destroyed by the players, had been fixed and had been placed here again, it didn\u2019t shine brightly as before.</p><br/><p>Like a broken lamp.</p><br/><p>And there were a few other players around the Altar who were looking around the pyramid with lazy expressions.</p><br/><p>They had come in because it was famous but soon realized nothing was here.</p><br/><p>It would\u2019ve been more fun if this place was filled with monsters and guards instead.</p><br/><p>But though this place was boring to others, it was better for Hansoo.</p><br/><p>Since he could avoid useless fights.</p><br/><p>Hansoo walked up to the giant altar and pretended to look at his surroundings as he read out everything at an extreme speed.</p><br/><p>From the scratches that didn\u2019t seem to mean anything and to even the symbols at the very corners of the pyramid.</p><br/><p>And soon Hansoo\u2019s eyes turned to the inside of the pyramid\u2019s walls.</p><br/><p>Countless skulls were hung in the inside of the pyramid.</p><br/><p>These skulls had small letters engraved on their foreheads.</p><br/><p>These were the skulls of the infected soldiers who had guarded this place in the past.</p><br/><p>These things, which had constantly revived from the power of the jewels, lost their immortality as the gem had been destroyed and the NPCs who had visited here took apart the skulls from their skeletons and displayed them on the inside of the pyramid.</p><br/><p>Kameria shrugged her shoulders from next to Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell. It\u2019s quite a sight but not that great to look at right? I don\u2019t know why those guys died in here though.\u201d</p><br/><p>These hundreds of thousands of corpse soldiers were originally NPCs.</p><br/><p>It would\u2019ve been understandable if they died in here after the dungeon opened but these guys had been here even before the dungeon opened.</p><br/><p>\u2018...They should\u2019ve have been placed here randomly due to the game\u2019s mechanics.\u2019</p><br/><p>As Kameira was making a confused expression.</p><br/><p>A small ruckus was made in the corner.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou cannot take that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...Tsk. Just an Npc, how annoying.\u201d</p><br/><p>A player got annoyed at the NPC as he was about to take a skull as souvenir and then threw the skull onto the ground.</p><br/><p>The guard frowned but didn\u2019t say anything as he placed the skull back onto the wall.</p><br/><p>\u2018These damned immortals.\u2019</p><br/><p>The guard mumbled inwardly.</p><br/><p>If they weren't here then none of the countless skulls would still be here.</p><br/><p>All of it would\u2019ve become souvenirs for these guys.</p><br/><p>The guard looked at the immortals walking around the inside.</p><br/><p>They were never serious and were very vicious and violent.</p><br/><p>The guard\u2019s eyes landed upon Kameria and Hansoo who were quietly observing things in the corner.</p><br/><p>With an expression saying that he wouldn\u2019t let them go if they did anything suspicious.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m going to chase them out the moment their 10 minutes are up.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo ignored the guard\u2019s eyes as he slowly read the small words of the Ains upon the skull\u2019s foreheads.</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s supernatural eyes allowed him to read every skull inside the pyramid from where he stood.</p><br/><p>The language of the Ains which he had painstakingly learned.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t fluent so it was more like deciphering but he could still understand them.</p><br/><p>This was what they meant roughly.</p><br/><p>But of course it wasn\u2019t this that was important.</p><br/><p>There was something else.</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked over the tens of thousands of skulls and then found something.</p><br/><p>\u2018Found it.\u2019</p><br/><p>A different looking language.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t the language of the Ains which flowed like water.</p><br/><p>It was instead created of straight lines, like a child\u2019s play.</p><br/><p>It was the ancient language of the Kingdom\u2019s mages.</p><br/><p>And there were many of these skulls in the pyramid.</p><br/><p>A total of 144.</p><br/><p>These skulls, which were spread out evenly, drew out a shape which resembled a magical formation. Of course normal people would not be able to figure out the formation due to countless skulls hiding them.</p><br/><p>Hansoo continued to read out the words and then found the skull that was located at the core.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s that. I found it.\u2019</p><br/><p>But it would be a bit hard to take that right now.</p><br/><p>Since the guard was glaring at him from afar.</p><br/><p>Though the inner parts of the Pyramid was large, it was hard to dodge the eyes of the many guards here.</p><br/><p>Though it was within a spot where he could reach, the guards would chase him down the moment he touched it.</p><br/><p>And it would become very annoying if he collided against them.</p><br/><p>The guards themselves weren\u2019t an issue but the one standing behind them was.</p><br/><p>The players, who had been complaining, hadn\u2019t left because they had good personalities.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? Let\u2019s go out. Time\u2019s almost up anyway. Even if we have nothing to prepare, we should still go there early.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kameira got bored as she spoke to Hansoo.</p><br/><p>Though a bit more time still existed, there wasn\u2019t much to see.</p><br/><p>Even more so for Kameira who had been here before.</p><br/><p>Hansoo frowned at Kameira\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do I have to aim for another chance? It would be nice if the Bug Killers moved around in here.\u2019</p><br/><p>Since it wasn\u2019t like he could buy time infinitely it would be nice for him to solve this in the quickest time possible but it had become hard for him to.</p><br/><p>Hansoo pondered for a moment and then nodded as he prepared to go outside.</p><br/><p>\u2018I guess I\u2019ll come here with a mask, knock down all the guards unconscious and run away with it.\u2019</p><br/><p>Though it would be dangerous, this was the only method for him.</p><br/><p>And this was the original method of the player who had found it anyway.</p><br/><p>As Hansoo was about to turn around.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh hey! We meet again!\u201d</p><br/><p>A voice calling them could be heard.</p><br/><p>Kameira frowned at that voice.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why did that guy come here.\u2019</p><br/><p>The Ecliptic Mania, who had failed the test before, had appeared before them.</p><br/><p>Kameira asked the man who had appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello. How did you get here?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man shouted as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are other parties other than yours, isn\u2019t it obvious how I got here?\u201d</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t openly angering them but it could clearly be heard that he was annoyed.</p><br/><p>It was clear that his pride had been hurt when he had failed earlier.</p><br/><p>Anyways, they could guess how he had come here.</p><br/><p>\u2018I thought he would go somewhere else after being infuriated...It seems he came in here with a party that would go up to the 2nd or the 3rd floor. Or came in here thoughtlessly.\u2019</p><br/><p>He was nowhere good enough for the 5th floor and would get in the way but he was suitable for the easier 2nd and 3rd floors.</p><br/><p>Of course the quality and quantity of the Protection Elixirs were much lower there, it was much easier due to only infected beasts and soldiers existing there instead of Ains.</p><br/><p>There were countless hunting grounds around the War Fortress. This place was indeed the best place in terms of efficiency.</p><br/><p>And it was the best choice if one was going to remain here for a long time.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well. Since he has come all the way to the War Fortress, he probably wants something out of it. I just hope he doesn\u2019t get in our way.\u2019</p><br/><p>Though there was a large difference in their skills, it didn\u2019t feel good to have someone who didn\u2019t like them lingering around them.</p><br/><p>And even more so if it was the dangerous Maze.</p><br/><p>As Kameira frowned.</p><br/><p>Ecliptic Mania gulped and he looked around cautiously.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is the last chance.\u2019</p><br/><p>He had shouted loudly to Kameira but his situation wasn\u2019t the best.</p><br/><p>He had gone into the first party by luck, no other parties that went to the 5th floor were willing to let him in after they realized his skills were lacking.</p><br/><p>But he didn\u2019t want to waste his time on the useless floors like those from the 1st to the 4th where everything had been squeezed out by others already.</p><br/><p>Since he hadn\u2019t come to the War Fortress by spending a fortune for that.</p><br/><p>While he was pondering what to do, somebody approached him.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>\u2018Korin kingdom huh.\u2019</p><br/><p>The Kingdom whose border stood against the original owner of the War Fortress, the Keil Kingdom.</p><br/><p>Though it was just an impudent NPC but her request was hard to deny.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, it\u2019s not like I will die for real anyway.\u2019</p><br/><p>As long as the reward was large, there was nothing he couldn\u2019t do.</p><br/><p>Ecliptic Mania thought of the female who had carefully approached him before and tightly grasped the item in his hands.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

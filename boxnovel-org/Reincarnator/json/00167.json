Die!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFucking bitch! Anton died because of you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Enraged people attacked Dakidus from all directions.</p><br/><p>Every throwable weapons in the Armory had been sent towards Dakidus.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuuuaaaaahhh!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Enraged Dakidus tried to rush up and rip the humans apart but he couldn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are you going.\u201d</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>Since Hansoo held him down every time he tried to.</p><br/><p>And thanks to this Dakidus had been receiving the assault of tens of bugs that he could destroy with just a single swipe.</p><br/><p>A few wasn\u2019t really a problem but the story changed when the number increased to thousands.</p><br/><p>There was no way he could hold on receiving these attacks that were coming down at him like rain.</p><br/><p>Dakidus got desperate and shouted out.</p><br/><p>\u201cRoooaaaar! You damned Humans! Karim! What is that Karim guy doing!\u201d</p><br/><p>This was not a scene he had expected to happen, ever.</p><br/><p>Since this shouldn\u2019t have happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaaammmniitt! You dumb humans! Do you even know what you guys are doing right now? Have you heard nothing from Karim!\u201d</p><br/><p>The people stopped at those words.</p><br/><p>They were already quite nervous.</p><br/><p>As to what the final words Karim had tried to say were.</p><br/><p>Though the remaining guards were followers of Karim, there was no intel from them as if they didn\u2019t know much.</p><br/><p>Dakidus made a bright expression after seeing this.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahahaha! Dumbasses! That\u2019s what I thought! You shouldn\u2019t be doing this if you heard the story! It seems that worthless Karim had died even before he was able to say this!\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a chance.</p><br/><p>If they were doing this even after hearing the story of Karim then there was no hope left for him.</p><br/><p>But if they hadn\u2019t heard Karim yet?</p><br/><p>There was a chance for his survival.</p><br/><p>Booooom!</p><br/><p>Dakidus smashed away the incoming golden spear of Hansoo as he shouted out loudly towards the surrounding people.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou dumb bastards! Shall I tell you a fun story? It\u2019s about that Clementine person!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn!\u2019</p><br/><p>Ekidu tried to shut him up but Dakidus was much more stronger than Karim who had lost his arms.</p><br/><p>Truth started to come out from the Dakidus\u2019s mouth while he was jumping around like a wounded beast.</p><br/><p>Loud enough to the point that everyone in the village could hear.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Dakidus who had been appointed as the Harvester, and managed the humans, and Clementine, the Executor of the plan, had shared quite a large amount of stories while creating the Green Road.</p><br/><p>Though Dakidus treated the humans as bugs, Clementine stimulated one\u2019s curiosity quite a lot.</p><br/><p>Clementine always spoke out, as if it was a habit, even while creating the village.</p><br/><p>Clementine made a mysterious smile at those words and then mumbled.</p><br/><p>Though the strength of individuals were important but numbers were also an important factor in determining the strength of a group.</p><br/><p>But there was a problem.</p><br/><p>The battle never ended and there was always competition.</p><br/><p>The clash with outside forces was harsh but the bigger problem was the internal dispute between the humans.</p><br/><p>The fact that they didn\u2019t have any knowledge as to who to target was an even larger problem.</p><br/><p>Since they didn\u2019t know when the people, whom they had entrusted their lives to, would backstab them.</p><br/><p>At least if they hadn\u2019t been comrades for numerous years.</p><br/><p>And this problem will continue even after they gone up.</p><br/><p>And an environment which changed all the time made it so there was no trust between the people.</p><br/><p>As danger and responsibility each person needed to bear increased and there were less resources, only more fights would occur.</p><br/><p>Clementine had continued to think this way but it was not enough.</p><br/><p>Since the power of the Helper clan or the Cross clan that had been set up by her enemies were too large.</p><br/><p>But the moment she saw the Yellow Zone.</p><br/><p>And as she saw the three races that didn\u2019t really like the humans.</p><br/><p>Clementine judged that it was the right time to begin her plans.</p><br/><p>If if was a world controlled by the humans then controlling everything wouldn\u2019t be that hard with just their own strength but this Yellow Zone was not the same.</p><br/><p>The Green Road beginning from the villages were a test.</p><br/><p>Something that tested the entire human race that the Higher races and Clementine\u2019s followers had set up.</p><br/><p>The ones who passed would be sent up and the failures\u2026 would get turned into an Offering.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t a need to send up anybody who would possibly become a threat to her.</p><br/><p>Dakidus continued to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell. Usually you will continue to get tested as you go through the Green Road. But since this had happened. Let\u2019s start the test even faster.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat crazy bitch\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone swirled their tongue around.</p><br/><p>These weren\u2019t words aimed towards Dakidus.</p><br/><p>They were just shocked at the insane plan that Clementine had set up.</p><br/><p>Dakidus laughed coldly as he looked at the adventurers.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it too hard? Let\u2019s make it simple. Stick by the Higher Races and decide to go up or side with the humans by playing around with that Ekidu and Hansoo. It\u2019s easy right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone started to mumble.</p><br/><p>It was clear which side they should side on.</p><br/><p>Since they were humans.</p><br/><p>Except the problem was that the winner and what would happen to the loser was too clear.</p><br/><p>If they side with the humans\u2026then they will all get massacred.</p><br/><p>How would they be able to survive if the Higher races got serious?</p><br/><p>\u2018Kuuheheheh. Good, good.\u2019</p><br/><p>Dakidus made a content smile as he saw their reactions.</p><br/><p>The attacks pouring towards him had been cut by half.</p><br/><p>Which means that they were pondering.</p><br/><p>\u2018Dumb Karim. If you said this earlier then things wouldn\u2019t have come this far.\u2019</p><br/><p>If Larim had said this earlier then they would\u2019ve been divided already and had ran away towards the Green Road and the great jungle.</p><br/><p>There was only one reason why some were still attacking.</p><br/><p>They were attacking because they thought that they crossed a line they should not have and that they wouldn\u2019t be forgiven anymore.</p><br/><p>Since they crossed the line, they wanted to see the end of it.</p><br/><p>\u2018Since I am mighty. I shall forgive you.\u2019</p><br/><p>Since the attacks had reduced, his body felt much better.</p><br/><p>Dakidus shouted out even louder.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince Hansoo and that bitch had did these stupid things, this village will get erased as a whole. Since there are a lot of other villages. Even if I die it\u2019ll be the same. But there is still a final choice for you guys! Stick with me! Then I will follow the agreement I made with Clementine when we created the village and treat you as allies! I will forgive every attack you have made until now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Dakidus then smiled</p><br/><p>\u201cI know that you guys are easily swept up by the mood you see. You aren\u2019t in the wrong. The ones who caused you to sway are the ones in the wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dakidus made a vicious smile towards Hansoo and Ekidu and then spoke out again.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will count to ten! Those who will stick by me! Stop the attacks! I won\u2019t even tell you to fight with me! As long as you stop\u2026You will be forgiven. If I die\u2026It\u2019ll become troublesome right?\u201d</p><br/><p>The people were split from those words.</p><br/><p>The storm-like attacks suddenly decreased in number drastically.</p><br/><p>And the battlefield suddenly got very quiet.</p><br/><p>As one person stopped and pondered, everything else happened in an instant.</p><br/><p>Like a wave, the silence ran throughout the entire village.</p><br/><p>Of course there were still a few who were still attacking.</p><br/><p>\u201cAarrrrk!\u201d</p><br/><p>People who had lost their precious friends and family to him.</p><br/><p>And the people who hadn\u2019t thrown their pride of humans away were attacking in a rage.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou dumb bastards! This is an amazing chance! A chance to kill that guy! What are you going to do if you miss this chance!\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the people who had stopped attacking spat back.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t say we\u2019ll join yet! You bastard! We\u2019re just thinking about it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? This fucking bitch!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd if you aren\u2019t going to guarantee our lives then how about shutting up?\u201d</p><br/><p>The already nervous and anxious battlefield\u2019s emotions swayed from Dakidus and ontop each other.</p><br/><p>And soon chaos occurred.</p><br/><p>Ekidu grinded her teeth as she saw this.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is what\u2026Karim trusted.\u2019</p><br/><p>Ekidu fell into despair.</p><br/><p>She had lived with hope.</p><br/><p>That the village wasn\u2019t perfect but was needed.</p><br/><p>That it was an oasis that gave strength for them to be able to go through the road of hope, the Green Road.</p><br/><p>But for that road to be just a test arena used for testing humans.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s a real shitty world.\u2019</p><br/><p>What had she fought for until now?</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>Boooooom!</p><br/><p>Hansoo got smashed by Dakidus\u2019s attack, flew past Ekidu and smashed into the ground.</p><br/><p>Kuududududk</p><br/><p>Dakidus laughed as he spoke after smashing away Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou brat. You shouldn\u2019t play around like that with just random information you picked up. What are you going to do now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dakidus admitted that Hansoo was amazing.</p><br/><p>But there was nowhere enough support from his surroundings.</p><br/><p>\u2018For him to dream about treason with just these guys.\u2019</p><br/><p>The humans were, in the end, just livestock they grew.</p><br/><p>Since this entire world was under their control.</p><br/><p>It was a bit vague before but thanks to Clementine, they had been able to gain the complete control.</p><br/><p>\u201cRandom huh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo spat out some blood and then grasped onto the Forked Lightning tightly after landing with a boom.</p><br/><p>He had told Ekidu.</p><br/><p>That this is the last test that he is giving them.</p><br/><p>Would it be a test if the student received help from the tester?</p><br/><p>Ooooooong</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked towards the golden castle up in the skies, the Atillan.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

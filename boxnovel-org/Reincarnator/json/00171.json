They did see something like that\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Ekidu shook her head.</p><br/><p>She had seen a lot of things while roaming the Otherworld for 8 years.</p><br/><p>But she had never even heard of a skill that could erase the lives thousands of people with one man\u2019s own power in an instant.</p><br/><p>\u2018Such a reaction when we need to group up tightly for the upcoming days\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>It might\u2019ve been different if there was leisure but in a situation like this where they had to soon face a powerful enemy, this type of emotion could blow up at any moment that became a spark.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do? Will it be okay like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded at the question which had a lot of underlying meanings.</p><br/><p>If the people fearing him were going to become a problem then he would need to explain.</p><br/><p>That it was not a skill he could use however he wanted and that he needed the help of the Atillan to perform it.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo did not explain it.</p><br/><p>Because he needed the fear right now.</p><br/><p>Well, he needed power that could make even his allies fear him.</p><br/><p>A kind and benevolent leader wasn\u2019t needed right now.</p><br/><p>The people needed somebody with power who could give them assurance.</p><br/><p>And as he expected, the expressions of fear did come up on the people\u2019s faces but an expression of relief also existed within.</p><br/><p>Relief of not standing against somebody with such powers.</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>Craack</p><br/><p>The sealing jade in Hansoo\u2019s hand made a sound as it cracked open.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s done huh.\u2019</p><br/><p>It made sense.</p><br/><p>While suppressing the tremendous mana of the Atillan, it had also been suppressing the mana of thousands of people at the same time.</p><br/><p>Even if it was the sealing jade, it couldn\u2019t handle all of that.</p><br/><p>Whoooosh</p><br/><p>\u201cUhh? The mana?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone made joyous remarks as they felt the mana returning back to their bodies.</p><br/><p>Their regeneration speed increased as strength poured into the muscles that had been fatigued by the battle and supplied them with energy.</p><br/><p>The people, who had been feeling empty due to the disappearance of mana that had been sustaining their body, suddenly made vigorous expressions.</p><br/><p>But at the same time they made worried expressions.</p><br/><p>Mana came back and they were filled with energy.</p><br/><p>And the reality of the fact that they would need to fight now had gotten even closer to them.</p><br/><p>They had gotten rid of Clementine\u2019s control and killed Dakidus.</p><br/><p>If the Higher races found out about this they would definitely not stand idle.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat will you do now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone woke up from Ekidu\u2019s question and started to gather around Hansoo.</p><br/><p>What happened from now on was very important.</p><br/><p>Since they hadn\u2019t done all this just because of the hatred they had for Dakidus.</p><br/><p>Their goals, in the end, was survival and they had only judged that this side had a higher chance.</p><br/><p>\u2018And\u2026This guy has the key.\u2019</p><br/><p>A person who had dragged down the god-like Dakidus onto the ground and had even killed him.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t any foundation for it but they still had this belief.</p><br/><p>Since Hansoo wouldn\u2019t have done all this without any plans.</p><br/><p>Hansoo lifted something around his waist after seeing the expressions of those people.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone frowned a bit as they looked at the item.</p><br/><p>A blue-colored crown that seemed like it would fit perfectly onto the head of a person.</p><br/><p>It looked so ordinary that they hadn\u2019t been able to discover it despite it being attached to Hansoo\u2019s waist.</p><br/><p>But as mana came back and it gained its original luster, everyone realized the identity of the crown.</p><br/><p>It was the blue crown that Dakidus had been wearing.</p><br/><p>Whatever it was made of, the hoola-hoop-sized giant crown had been shrunk down to fit the head of a human.</p><br/><p>But the people shook their heads as they saw the blue crown that was shining brightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t win with just that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Karhal spoke with a worried expressions after approaching Hansoo.</p><br/><p>Satellite Fortress, Atillan.</p><br/><p>Its might was indeed absolute.</p><br/><p>It would indeed be able to protect the ten thousand of them safely.</p><br/><p>At least from the beasts and humans.</p><br/><p>But fighting against the Higher Races, such as the Arukon, was impossible.</p><br/><p>Since those guys had tens of such things.</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded at Karhal\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Since they had no chances of winning a full frontal clash.</p><br/><p>No matter how many of them attack the Higher race, who had the powerful Satellite Fortresses, it would simply be smashing a rock with eggs.</p><br/><p>A single Satellite Fortress can erase tens of villages.</p><br/><p>But then he couldn\u2019t use the sealing jade to beat down every one of them one by one.</p><br/><p>Since the Higher Races would figure it out and be wary of it.</p><br/><p>The reason why he had attacked Dakidus was because he needed a single Satellite Fortress to start all this, actually getting all the Satellite Fortresses powerless and fighting head on would be the best method.</p><br/><p>The reason why the death of Dakidus and the Satellite Fortress being stolen not having been caught already was because Dakidus\u2019s one Satellite Fortress controlled this vast human area.</p><br/><p>One rotation took months, not having any communications wasn\u2019t that weird.</p><br/><p>They probably would have emergency contact information just in case they got hit by the humans but he wouldn\u2019t really need to worry about that.</p><br/><p>But the other areas were different.</p><br/><p>As the Satellite Fortresses were set in locations where an attack from the enemy could come at any time, once any of them got destroyed they would know instantly.</p><br/><p>So he needed to wipe them all off instantly.</p><br/><p>And he knew how to.</p><br/><p>Since he came from the future.</p><br/><p>\u2018But I cannot say it.\u2019</p><br/><p>If there wasn\u2019t any information then he wouldn\u2019t be able to give them any reassurance.</p><br/><p>But then to persuade the people he needed to pull out the information from the future.</p><br/><p>An ironic situation.</p><br/><p>But there was still a method.</p><br/><p>The moment Hansoo wore the crown on his head.</p><br/><p>Kiiiiiiiiiiiinggggg</p><br/><p>The Satellite Fortress went into the process of accepting its new owner.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that hard.</p><br/><p>Since there wasn\u2019t a lock or anything.</p><br/><p>These were all things the Arukons had stolen from the Sages. In order to use it for themselves they had to get rid of all the locks</p><br/><p>They probably wouldn\u2019t have worried much as they got rid of them anyway.</p><br/><p>Since they wouldn\u2019t ever have thought they would be taken over by humans.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo up. The rest organize the Armory and gather up the runes and artifacts. I\u2019ll go with a few people who will relay the message later.\u201d</p><br/><p>The people nodded as they heard the words that told them not everyone had to go.</p><br/><p>Since those words were very welcome to them who were extremely tired.</p><br/><p>Since their mana came back, they needed time to heal and regenerate their stamina.</p><br/><p>And soon the bright light that came down from the Satellite Fortress started to pull the people upwards.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cWoah.\u201d</p><br/><p>The people started to exclaim out as they walked into the control room for the first time.</p><br/><p>Blue light, which they often saw in Sci-Fi movies of the past, filled up all the space around htem.</p><br/><p>Tidik Tididididik</p><br/><p>While they were admiring the view.</p><br/><p>Hansoo greedily collected all the information from the Atillan after he came up.</p><br/><p>Starting from the most useless information to some that could not be leaked out no matter what.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026That easily?\u2019</p><br/><p>Karhal let out a dry laugh as he saw information constantly coming up on the screens.</p><br/><p>It seemed like there was a lock but from the codes Hansoo inputted, all those locks instantly disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u2018He doesn\u2019t seem like he would be good at such things\u2026 It\u2019s as if he knows the passwords.\u2019</p><br/><p>As Karhal looked at Hansoo in wonder.</p><br/><p>Hansoo, as if he had read Karhal\u2019s mind, replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so surprised by it, it\u2019s what I heard from Dakidus.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone nodded at those words.</p><br/><p>Since their questions had been answered to a point.</p><br/><p>\u2018He didn\u2019t die in peace huh.\u2019</p><br/><p>Ekidu clicked her tongue.</p><br/><p>She wondered where Hansoo had taken him at the very end but it seems he had retrieved some intel.</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>Tiiiririrk</p><br/><p>A map appeared on the screen they were looking at.</p><br/><p>A map which clearly showed hundreds of other villages with tremendous detail.</p><br/><p>Not just the territory of the Arukons but even the villages of the other two races.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026Damn. It\u2019s really a farm huh.\u2019</p><br/><p>Karhal made a bitter expression as he looked at the red line connecting between the villages.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that only the location of the villages were written on this map.</p><br/><p>The map, which even listed the military information of each village, was clearly a very precious tool for war.</p><br/><p>To the point that Hansoo taking over the Satellite Fortress was because of this.</p><br/><p>And would there only be a single map in this giant Satellite Fortress?</p><br/><p>Hansoo went past the countless amount of information and suddenly opened up a file.</p><br/><p>A document that was marked as black unlike the others which were all marked blue.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>Karhal and Ekidu, who had been standing next to Hansoo, heard those words and focused on the screen.</p><br/><p>Hansoo didn\u2019t really focus.</p><br/><p>Since he knew what was in here to some degree.</p><br/><p>A legacy of the Sages which his friends had found at the end of the Green Road.</p><br/><p>An item that was dimensions apart from the item that had turned into dust in his hands, the Sealing jade.</p><br/><p>A final weapon that the Sages had created and had been left behind due to them being ambushed by the Higher Races before they could even use it.</p><br/><p>Hansoo continued his speech.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we use that then all the mana within the Yellow zone will get suppressed\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026All the mana?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded.</p><br/><p>It would suppress all the mana in the Zone.</p><br/><p>The Satellite Fortresses flying in the sky will fall and the blue shields defending their body would get taken off.</p><br/><p>Something that his friends had started up in a dangerous situation and used it to freeze an entire race in the past.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is why you guys had been reduced to three races from four.\u2019</p><br/><p>The fourth race, who had their mana tied down and had powerless Satellite Fortresses, had been trampled by the other three races, the Arukon, Akalachias and the Rebeloongs.</p><br/><p>This was why the job this time around was very important.</p><br/><p>If he could activate it properly, all the mana in this zone will get tied down.</p><br/><p>But Ekidu frowned as she read over the information.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026It doesn\u2019t show us the location. Where is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ekidu spoke with a slight excitement.</p><br/><p>It was to be expected.</p><br/><p>Hansoo had turned the Satellite Fortress powerless from one Sealing Jade.</p><br/><p>But an item that could instantly freeze up every Satellite Fortress the enemy had.</p><br/><p>The damage they would receive would also be great but compared to the damage their opponents would receive, what they themselves would have to deal with was miniscule.</p><br/><p>\u2018We can actually win\u2019</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that they would win by freezing up the Satellite Fortresses.</p><br/><p>It was just that their chances to win would increase tremendously.</p><br/><p>But for the most important part, the location, to be missing.</p><br/><p>\u2018It marked all the other information but why this\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo spoke simply.</p><br/><p>This isn\u2019t in the hands of these guys.</p><br/><p>It was not something that the Higher Races had.</p><br/><p>It was something that those guys were fervently looking for.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen where\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnd of the Green Road.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo replied again at Ekidu\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnd of the Green Road. In the center of the battlefield Clementine made.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ekidu\u2019s expression froze up as she heard Hansoo\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Green Road.</p><br/><p>According to the information on the map, this place was true hell.</p><br/><p>Though it had been marked as the sole escape route for the humans, it was actually swarming with Clementine\u2019s underlings who managed the Green Road.</p><br/><p>And Clementine\u2019s underlings weren\u2019t weaklings.</p><br/><p>People who had been chosen from the strongest of the Hunters and Guards.</p><br/><p>They had been able to get rid of Karim with an ambush when there wasn\u2019t any mana but if there was mana then they would\u2019ve received tremendous injuries.</p><br/><p>Karim\u2019s abilities were that great.</p><br/><p>But in Clementine\u2019s forces, there were tons of people who were around Karim\u2019s level.</p><br/><p>And that wasn\u2019t all.</p><br/><p>\u2018If we only had that\u2026We might be able to do something.\u2019</p><br/><p>Ekidu frowned as she checked the map.</p><br/><p>The entire Green Road was being surveilled by three Satellite Fortresses.</p><br/><p>Hidden from the normal adventurers.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is bad.\u2019</p><br/><p>There were only three Satellite Fortresses that managed over a hundred villages.</p><br/><p>While taking turns.</p><br/><p>But the entire Green Road was always being surveilled by each one of the three Satellite Fortresses that each race had sent.</p><br/><p>No matter how vicious the Green Road which cut across the great jungle was, something at the calibre of killing Dakidus would get them caught instantly.</p><br/><p>Using the Sealing jade like now was dangerous and taking their own Satellite Fortress to smash them apart was impossible.</p><br/><p>Since they would sink instantly from the focused fire of three Satellite Fortresses.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026We need to use the Destruction Jade in order to fell the Satellite Fortresses but we need to fell those Satellite Fortresses in order to use the Destruction Jade?\u2019</p><br/><p>It was not something they could solve with just numbers.</p><br/><p>They would get massacred by the Satellite Fortresses.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026That Clementine person. Is quite amazing. How did she even obtain such a thing\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As she had heard, it was something that was fatal against the Higher races.</p><br/><p>Without this, an alliance wouldn\u2019t have been created.</p><br/><p>Since they weren\u2019t equals in their eyes.</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded at Ekidu\u2019s mumbles.</p><br/><p>\u2018Clementine was indeed lucky.\u2019</p><br/>\n</div>"}

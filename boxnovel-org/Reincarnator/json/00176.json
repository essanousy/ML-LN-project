Did something go wrong?\u2019</p><br/><p>It seemed like it attacked at random but there was a reason for all of its attacks.</p><br/><p>Junghwan made a confused expression as he hurriedly checked the other areas.</p><br/><p>Since that wasn\u2019t the only location where the Triple Fusion Beast popped out at.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cUwaaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Triple Fusion Beasts, Which had been released into the funnel area, were chasing and driving people in all directions.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamnit!\u201d</p><br/><p>A 30m tall monster that was charging towards them with black colored claws that were larger than a human\u2019s body was like fear itself.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damnit! It\u2019s much larger than a normal 1st grade monster!\u2019</p><br/><p>Merelin, an ex-Hunter from a village, grinded her teeth as she saw the beast running around in a rampage.</p><br/><p>One might think that size didn\u2019t matter anymore to these Hunters, who have reached the level of a superhuman, but size was actually a very important factor.</p><br/><p>Since one\u2019s mass and size didn\u2019t really increase along with the runes.</p><br/><p>Even with the same amount of strength, if a human got hit by those claws then they would just get flung into the air.</p><br/><p>And their own reach was much shorter as well.</p><br/><p>They can overcome this to a certain degree with their skills but if mana, resistance and defense was around the same level then having a larger body was always better.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fuck it, let\u2019s try attacking it!\u2019</p><br/><p>Merelin was an adventurer who had been in the Yellow Zone for almost one and a half years.</p><br/><p>She had fought against a few 1st grade Monsters before.</p><br/><p>She had never seen something as powerful as this before but she wouldn\u2019t just stay idle and get killed.</p><br/><p>Soon a large amount of energy was gathered in her hands.</p><br/><p>She prepared her skill, Diffusion Shot, and then flung it towards the beast.</p><br/><p>Booooom!</p><br/><p>Tadadadak</p><br/><p>Grrrrr!</p><br/><p>The Triple Fusion Beast felt its skin burning in as it looked towards Merelin.</p><br/><p>And she frowned from this scene.</p><br/><p>Since her skill had only barely made its skin burn a bit.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn\u2026I should\u2019ve have enlarged it to affect more area.\u2019</p><br/><p>A human would die if a hole the size of their head was created on them but to a large beast it would just tickle a bit.</p><br/><p>Those things wouldn\u2019t stop in their tracks just because a few needle holes were created in their body.</p><br/><p>No, they would actually just get even more enraged.</p><br/><p>One would need to blow apart a part of their entire body in order to stop their movements but in order to increase the effective size of a skill the damage would decrease drastically.</p><br/><p>A single arrow to the heart would kill a human but for such a large beast, a hole the size of a few human\u2019s heads would be needed.</p><br/><p>\u2018But\u2026 My skills work against it!\u2019</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t like the Arukons where their skills didn\u2019t work at all.</p><br/><p>Then it was possible.</p><br/><p>Since she wasn\u2019t alone.</p><br/><p>Merelin turned around and shouted to behind her.</p><br/><p>\u201cCharge!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment all the people who were running away looked at each other.</p><br/><p>Merelin\u2019s comrades, the 85 people, and the 117 others from a different village.</p><br/><p>And these people figured something important out in that short moment.</p><br/><p>Something very simple but important as well.</p><br/><p>\u2018If we don\u2019t attack\u2026 It goes for the weaker ones first?\u2019</p><br/><p>That bastard of a beast with a mouse\u2019s head and a wolf\u2019s body was weird, it miraculously found the weakest target first and was killing them first.</p><br/><p>\u2018Then\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Everyone looked around their surroundings.</p><br/><p>If they all attack then at least 50 of them would die in the process.</p><br/><p>Actually, it might even be more if their teamwork isn\u2019t perfect.</p><br/><p>And they couldn\u2019t guarantee that they wouldn\u2019t be part of that 50.</p><br/><p>But if they run then a much lesser number would die.</p><br/><p>Since that beast wasn\u2019t focused on them right now.</p><br/><p>As they finished thinking.</p><br/><p>Papapapa!</p><br/><p>They all ran in different directions.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou fucking bastards!\u201d</p><br/><p>Roaaaaarr!</p><br/><p>Merelin shouted out in befuddlement but then started to madly run away as well.</p><br/><p>Since fighting it alone would just end in a meaningless death.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamnit! Spread out and run!\u201d</p><br/><p>Merelin shouted out as she ran.</p><br/><p>And as the people who were attacking it started to run away, the Triple Fusion Beast started going for the weaker ones in order one by one.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how it should be.\u201d</p><br/><p>Junghwan nodded as he watched the chaos.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t matter if it the person was a good and trustable person or not.</p><br/><p>Since they already had their standards.</p><br/><p>One\u2019s own strength.</p><br/><p>An absolute strength that can even go against a hundred people alone.</p><br/><p>That was the only important factor.</p><br/><p>\u2018The villages are useful but they have too many useless things.\u2019</p><br/><p>Junghwan mumbled as he fumbled around with the Red Jade in his hands.</p><br/><p>Something like this wasn\u2019t even needed in the past before they made a compromise with the higher races.</p><br/><p>Since reaching the portal after getting through the Higher Races proved one\u2019s strength by itself.</p><br/><p>But after they had a compromise and the Higher Races backed out, there was a need for them to do a few things.</p><br/><p>Since they would enter in large groups if left alone.</p><br/><p>Then weaklings would come up which would result in making it hard to control the huge masses.</p><br/><p>So they release the Triple Fusion Beast.</p><br/><p>And using its amazing ability which found out the weakest ones first.</p><br/><p>\u2018But\u2026 How did he survive?\u2019</p><br/><p>It attacked the weakest ones.</p><br/><p>But weak ones should not be able to survive from its attack.</p><br/><p>But the person who had been hit by the laser from before was still alive.</p><br/><p>Which means that he was quite strong.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026It had never attacked the strong one first before.\u2019</p><br/><p>But even before Junghwan could turn his head to look at that special man after losing interest in the villagers who were running away.</p><br/><p>Kiiiiiing</p><br/><p>He was shocked at the Red Jade in his hands which trembled as he hastily looked outside.</p><br/><p>Since an impossible event had occurred.</p><br/><p>\u2018What? The Triple Fusion Beast died?\u2019</p><br/><p>Of course it could die.</p><br/><p>But when these things felt danger, the instincts of the Rebeloongs within its body would activate.</p><br/><p>Group hunt.</p><br/><p>It would run away the moment it felt danger.</p><br/><p>At the same time it would sent out a super sonic wave that only Rebeloongs could hear and call its comardes.</p><br/><p>Its death meant that it didn\u2019t even have the time to run away.</p><br/><p>\u2018Did that guy possibly\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Junghwan looked down below the cliff in a hurry.</p><br/><p>Then he opened his eyes wide as he looked at the man who was now fighting a second Triple Fusion Beast.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>Chiiiiiiing!</p><br/><p>Booooom!</p><br/><p>A red laser which had erased 20 Hunters from the face of the world in an instant.</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s body withstood that laser and stood still.</p><br/><p>Kiiiiiing!</p><br/><p>The red laser collided with the golden reinforcement around Hansoo\u2019s body and got diffused around.</p><br/><p>Tudududuk</p><br/><p>Trees got burnt and the ground melted down from the diffused beams.</p><br/><p>Even the diffused beam was that strong.</p><br/><p>\u2018Rebeloong\u2019s destruction beam.\u2019</p><br/><p>If the Arukons had powerful bodies and the Akalachis could fly into the skies then the Rebeloongs had many more of their kind as well as being able to use a destruction beam.</p><br/><p>Abilities that the Sages had bestowed upon the weak races that couldn\u2019t even defend their own bodies.</p><br/><p>And the Triple Fusion Beast, which was made up of mixing these three races, could use it as well.</p><br/><p>Hoooook!</p><br/><p>And as if Hansoo couldn\u2019t handle it for long as well, he quickly swung his Forked Lightning to smash apart the beam as he moved out.</p><br/><p>And as Hansoo came out from the beam the Triple Fusion Beast was wary and ready to defend itself.</p><br/><p>It had to.</p><br/><p>Since after it had come to help its comrade after hearing the desperate cry, the only thing it saw was a corpse filled with holes.</p><br/><p>And the one who did all that was in front of its eyes.</p><br/><p>Since the Arukon\u2019s body, which was physically enhanced, was constantly sending warning signals from its sixth sense.</p><br/><p>Hansoo frowned as it looked at the Triple Fusion Beast that didn\u2019t even care for everything else and was only focused on him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tsk. is it because I killed Dakidus?\u2019</p><br/><p>Usually it would only go for the weakest one first but that\u2019s only if their opponents weren\u2019t a threat.</p><br/><p>He wondered why it had specifically ran over to them but it seems like they sense the traces of Dakidus within his body.</p><br/><p>To be exact, the body of Dakidus that the Thousand Soldiers Armor ate up.</p><br/><p>But this was actually a chance in some sense.</p><br/><p>\u2018Try shooting it again.\u2019</p><br/><p>As Hansoo motioned with his hands to attack again, the Triple Fusion Beast spat out the beam again.</p><br/><p>Chiiiiing!</p><br/><p>A beam of laser came out from the Triple Fusion Beast\u2019s mouth as it flew past the ground.</p><br/><p>Booooom!</p><br/><p>Hansoo didn\u2019t even think about dodging the destruction beam as he blocked it with his own body.</p><br/><p>Kwaaadududududk!</p><br/><p>The Demonic Dragon\u2019s Reinforcement got shredded apart.</p><br/><p>And the mana within his body was getting drained like a pond within a mountain in flames.</p><br/><p>But he had to do this.</p><br/><p>Since it would run away otherwise.</p><br/><p>Hansoo shouted towards his back loudly!</p><br/><p>\u201cKarhal!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cJust a moment\u2026It\u2019s done!\u201d</p><br/><p>While Hansoo was buying time.</p><br/><p>The Quintuple Beam in Karhal\u2019s hands flew towards the Triple Fusion Beast.</p><br/><p>But he didn\u2019t spread it out.</p><br/><p>Small. Very small.</p><br/><p>The five beams, which had condensed into a size in which a thin woman may barely be able to go through, flew towards the Triple Fusion Beast.</p><br/><p>Which was sending out a beam of laser from its wide open mouth.</p><br/><p>Kyaaaaak!</p><br/><p>The Triple Fusion Beast screamed.</p><br/><p>The attack wasn\u2019t fast.</p><br/><p>It could\u2019ve probably dodged if it flew into the air.</p><br/><p>But it didn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>\u2018It cannot use two traits at the same time.\u2019</p><br/><p>A beast made by fusing the three races.</p><br/><p>But it could not use all three at the same time.</p><br/><p>Only one at a time.</p><br/><p>Which meant that while it was shooting the laser, it was merely a stationary cannon.</p><br/><p>Kuuudududuk</p><br/><p>A hole was created below the Triple Fusion Beast\u2019s waist.</p><br/><p>But this was not a fatal wound.</p><br/><p>A hole a bit larger than a human\u2019s head could be easily healed within a night to that giant beast.</p><br/><p>There was a reason why it had chosen to use the Rebeloong\u2019s trait to attack instead of the Akalachia\u2019s trait to dodge.</p><br/><p>It would\u2019ve ran away if Hansoo wasn\u2019t here but there wasn\u2019t really a need to stop attacking to dodge an attack like this.</p><br/><p>Kiirururuk!</p><br/><p>But as the Triple Fusion Beast made a snort-like noise and was about to pour all its strength into the beam.</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>The body of the Triple Fusion Beast, which had been laying down in the distance, blew apart.</p><br/><p>At the same time something within the corpse which was blazing white suddenly dashed towards the Triple Fusion Beast which was sending out its beam.</p><br/><p>Kyaaaaak!</p><br/><p>The Arukon\u2019s genes that was a part of the Triple Fusion Beast madly sent warning signals.</p><br/><p>But Ekidu\u2019s speed when she was using the White River Demonic Art was numerous times faster than the Quintuple beam.</p><br/><p>Kwaaadududk!</p><br/><p>And in the next instant Ekidu jumped into the hole created in the Triple Fusion Beast\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>A loud noise of friction was heard between her Scarlet Yang Armor and the flesh of the beast due to the size being a bit small but Ekidu opened up the injury and hacked her way in.</p><br/><p>Even before the beast could handle her.</p><br/><p>And soon.</p><br/><p>Rooooaaaaaaarrrr!</p><br/><p>The Triple Fusion Beast went on a rampage.</p><br/><p>Nothing would be able to handle the pain of something smashing their organs and cutting their muscles from the inside.</p><br/><p>Kwaduk! Kwaduk!</p><br/><p>The Triple Fusion Beast dug around its injury in order to pull out the bug inside its body but it was all futile.</p><br/><p>Since Ekidu didn\u2019t allow herself to be caught by the hand which was carefully entering the body just in case it would hurt itself.</p><br/><p>Ekidu actually just dodged away from the hand and madly bored towards the more important organs.</p><br/><p>Soon.</p><br/><p>Koooouuuuu!</p><br/><p>The Triple Fusion Beast fell on the ground after its heart was blown apart.</p><br/><p>Just like the corpse which it had seen after it got here.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo frowned as he looked at the Triple Fusion Beast.</p><br/><p>\u2018How many died from this thing this time around?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo frowned.</p><br/><p>He had also taken the test that Mount Liang had given them.</p><br/><p>And this test will continue on for close to a month.</p><br/><p>Until the number of people got reduced by almost half.</p><br/><p>If his trait hadn\u2019t awakened to a certain degree in the past then he would\u2019ve died then as well.</p><br/><p>Karhal shouted towards Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do now? What about those guys?\u201d</p><br/><p>Karhal then pointed towards Marun and his comrades who had surrounded him.</p><br/><p>\u2018These damned bastards.\u2019</p><br/><p>Karhal frowned as he looked at Marun who had stopped in place to watch instead of running away.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Marun, who had chosen to watch instead of running away, made a shocked expression while looking at Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s not that they only have three but just that they only need three huh.\u2019</p><br/><p>They were confident with just three.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What are you going to do Marun?\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the Hunters, who was making an expression full of fear, asked Marun.</p><br/><p>Since almost 30 people had died in that short moment from the beams.</p><br/><p>Even when they didn\u2019t fight directly.</p><br/><p>It would be a huge problem if things like that swarmed the forest.</p><br/><p>Marun smiled as he spoke.</p><br/><p>There was quite a useful thing in front of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it seems like we\u2019re lucky. We should help each other in times of trouble. It doesn\u2019t look like they are having easy as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know why they were travelling with only three people but he knew that they wouldn\u2019t deny his offer at a time like this.</p><br/><p>Marun then looked towards Hansoo and the other two in the distance.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I didn\u2019t want to get mixed up with them again\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>R-Korun Nell thought to himself.</p><br/><p>He\u2019d realized the moment they forced him to blow the train up that he had fallen into a nasty trap.</p><br/><p>He\u2019d ended up slamming the research center straight into Aokan.</p><br/><p>Crazy bastards.</p><br/><p>But they had somehow found him in order to use him again.</p><br/><p>It was his fault for just quietly hiding away, thinking that they had no more use for him.</p><br/><p>Kiriel chuckled as she looked at R-Korun Nell.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that. What were you going to do without us? Were you going to live here forever?\u201d</p><br/><p>From those words\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201c...\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014R-Korun Nell merely gritted his teeth and stayed silent.</p><br/><p>Because her words were right.</p><br/><p>He\u2019d quietly hid himself in a nearby refugee center awaiting rescue because he knew even having ten lives wouldn\u2019t be enough if he got swept up with them.</p><br/><p>Trusting in the fact that the Kalkuroun Fleet would not leave him behind, a Dragon God Soldier from the Nell family.</p><br/><p>And how he had rejoiced when he saw nine Dragon God Soldiers descending from the fleet.</p><br/><p>But he had been in despair ever since.</p><br/><p>The Dragon God Soldiers never came to his rescue.</p><br/><p>Aokan, where they had charged into, had blown up.</p><br/><p>And the Kalkuroun Fleet, after sending down a single ray of attack, had left for Angkara.</p><br/><p>Lost in despair and wondering what to do from that point on...</p><br/><p>These people came to find them.</p><br/><p>They had somehow found him deep in hiding and simply dragged him along.</p><br/><p>To this strange elevator.</p><br/><p>And at this moment, they were rising up at a fast pace.</p><br/><p>\u2018...I\u2019m not sure if this is the right choice.\u2019</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t have a choice really, but because he was feeling the dangerous aura the two were letting out with each second, he didn\u2019t feel quite comfortable.</p><br/><p>Kiriel tapped his shoulder and said:</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t feel so burdened. We even gave you back the Dragon God Armor, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiriel had changed out of R-Korun Nell\u2019s Dragon God Armor to one in better condition, taken from the nine Dragon God Soldiers.</p><br/><p>Of course, she returned R-Korun Nell\u2019s original armor.</p><br/><p>R-Korun Nell clenched his teeth.</p><br/><p>There was only reason why they\u2019d given his armor back.</p><br/><p>Since they had the confidence to crush him no matter what he tried to do anymore.</p><br/><p>This overbearing aura.</p><br/><p>\u2018What in the world\u2026 Did those aliens go through a metamorphic stage or something? How did they get this strong in such a short amount of time?\u2019</p><br/><p>R-Korun Nell looked fearfully at Kiriel.</p><br/><p>This girl had been at a similar level as him back at the giant train.</p><br/><p>Well, she\u2019d pushed him back, but they still had a good fight.</p><br/><p>But look at her now.</p><br/><p>She had evolved into a powerful existence far beyond his imagination.</p><br/><p>An existence that even a truckload of people like him wouldn\u2019t be able to handle.</p><br/><p>He\u2019d felt a similar power level of a Dragon God Soldier when she wore the armor in the past, but it was much more different now.</p><br/><p>The fleet.</p><br/><p>Angkara\u2019s proud Fleet of Flames.</p><br/><p>That small body was letting out an aura that was as strong as an entire fleet.</p><br/><p>A fleet that was designed to destroy entire moons.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ugh, whatever.\u2019</p><br/><p>R-Korun Nell stopped thinking about it.</p><br/><p>He decided to just go with the flow.</p><br/><p>There was no way for him to beat them anyway.</p><br/><p>\u2018Anyway\u2026 something like this existed, huh?\u2019</p><br/><p>R-Korun Nell looked around the elevator.</p><br/><p>Although most B and A-Levels, and even N-Levels, did not know much about these aliens.</p><br/><p>He, being a Dragon God Soldier, an R-Level and a member of a family, had picked up some stories.</p><br/><p>\u2018Anyway\u2026 I didn\u2019t know how they appeared, but this is how it happened, huh?\u2019</p><br/><p>R-Korun Nell looked curiously at the elevator, which they couldn\u2019t make even with their advanced technology.</p><br/><p>But then\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014oooooong\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014as if the elevator was stopping, it started to slow down.</p><br/><p>\u2014kiiiiiing!\u2014</p><br/><p>The elevator doors opened as a bright light seeped in through the gap.</p><br/><p>\u2014whooosh!\u2014</p><br/><p>A strong wind entered the space of the elevator.</p><br/><p>And R-Korun Nell\u2019s eyes twitched at the sight that appeared before him.</p><br/><p>\u2018We\u2026 really arrived.\u2019</p><br/><p>He had been skeptical.</p><br/><p>But they had really returned to his planet through this strange elevator.</p><br/><p>A familiar scene.</p><br/><p>Amidst the ruins.</p><br/><p>A few buildings that still seemed to be in use stood tall while maintaining their structural integrity.</p><br/><p>And the old armored vehicles moving through those buildings.</p><br/><p>R-Korun Nell frowned when he saw this and spat out:</p><br/><p>\u201cThe trash dump\u2026 I wondered where you guys popped out from, but I guess this was it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTrash dump?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiriel looked at R-Korun Nell in curiosity.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Planet Angkara.</p><br/><p>Although the owners of Angkara had succeeded in creating a great civilization with the power of the Flame, they couldn\u2019t stay in peace with one another.</p><br/><p>They had fought for a thousand years.</p><br/><p>They needed more strength to win over their opponent, so they continued to create new and powerful weapons.</p><br/><p>Although there were countless empires, families, and nations, there were bound to be those who were more advanced than others.</p><br/><p>So during the thousand-year battle, they had increased their strength by either uniting the other nations or destroying them entirely.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Neropa Union and the Pompeion Empire are the two largest powers that remained after all this.\u201d</p><br/><p>R-Korun Nell said as he looked at Kiriel.</p><br/><p>The Pompeion Empire that had devoured the entire Pompeion continent up north.</p><br/><p>And the three families in the south.</p><br/><p>The Nell, Ron, and Pael families.</p><br/><p>Although these three families had fought each other in the past to increase their individual strength, that was something they couldn\u2019t afford to do anymore.</p><br/><p>Since the Pompeion Empire was on the cusp of sweeping them away.</p><br/><p>So after feeling the dangers of the Pompeion Empire\u2019s fast expansion, the Nell, Ron, and Pael families decided to unite and create the greatest alliance ever recorded in history.</p><br/><p>The result of this was the Neropa Union which succeeded in rivaling the Pompeion Empire.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the place where the survivors hide\u2014in the shadows of the ruins that the two forces created while they were busy battling each other.\u201d</p><br/><p>R-Korun Nell\u2019s expression turned dark as he spoke.</p><br/><p>Small and weak countries, unions, families, and tribes.</p><br/><p>Their endings were clear from their limits in strength and power.</p><br/><p>Either stick to one of the two sides.</p><br/><p>Or be erased from history.</p><br/><p>The history of war up until this point had proven this.</p><br/><p>But these guys picked neither of the two choices.</p><br/><p>No, they were using the situation for their own benefit.</p><br/><p>By keeping the balance between the two forces.</p><br/><p>Or making ridiculous requests by threatening to help the other side if they didn\u2019t comply.</p><br/><p>But their strength was a bit too significant for the two forces to simply ignore, so they often fulfilled their requests.</p><br/><p>\u2018We\u2019ll make sure to destroy you all once the war ends. You presumptuous bastards, making such requests without any kind of backing\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>R-Korun Nell suddenly flinched.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Backing?\u2019</p><br/><p>Did something exist in the trash dump that they could trust in?</p><br/><p>At that moment\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014Hansoo chuckled as he spoke to R-Korun Nell.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve come to a good spot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Perfect.\u2019</p><br/><p>Out of the three locations, he didn\u2019t know where the elevator would arrive at.</p><br/><p>But the place the natives called the trash dump, or the , was the perfect place to come to.</p><br/><p>There was something he needed to acquire here.</p><br/><p>\u2018The External Flame Divine Tool.\u2019</p><br/><p>A divine tool created to control the external Flame.</p><br/><p>The entire planet.</p><br/><p>A divine tool of legends that had the power to control the hidden within the planet.</p><br/><p>\u2018Just wait a bit, I\u2019ll bring you some friends. Of course\u2026 there are probably a lot of flies buzzing around you.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014oooooong\u2014</p><br/><p>Precious artifacts were destined to have flies swarming around it.</p><br/><p>Mainly, people who didn\u2019t know the true value behind them.</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked at the Mjolnir in his hand and chuckled at the beings who were approaching them from a distance.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>A woman asked a man in front of her:</p><br/><p>\u201cWe just need to trust you, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Once we have that, we can turn things around. The Neropa Union will become a beacon of hope. That Sangjin guy told me this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangjin, nicknamed the King of Hell.</p><br/><p>The man laughed as he spoke the name of the man who\u2019d led the army of the fallen.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

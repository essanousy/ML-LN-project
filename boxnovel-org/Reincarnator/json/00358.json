Since that\u2019s the only place that could manage so many people effectively.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018And Melchizedek would feel the safest there as well.\u2019</p><br/><p>R-Korun Nell thought to himself.</p><br/><p>The first place Melchizedek had taken after its rebellion was the Defense City, Aokan.</p><br/><p>The heavily-guarded giant city had many people, so it had been very reliant on the AI, Melchizedek.</p><br/><p>And Melchizedek would\u2019ve felt safer only after taking over Aokan as it was the most heavily-guarded city.</p><br/><p>Because it was a city meant to be the first line of defense, the entire city was split into various sections by alloy walls.</p><br/><p>Even if enemy forces breached the outer walls, they could divide the city up and buy more time until the enemies reached the central area.</p><br/><p>Although the central area was a residential location, as a place for a Nursery, Aokan was one of the best places to set it up.</p><br/><p>It would be hard for the people inside to run away, and it could divide them into groups of a few hundred or a few thousand.</p><br/><p>An alloy similar to that of their starships had also been used to make the walls.</p><br/><p>These walls could even withstand the Dragon God Soldiers to a certain degree.</p><br/><p>\u2018Wait, these insane bastards want to go to such a place?\u2019</p><br/><p>R-Korun Nell was at a loss as he looked at the two beings who wanted to crawl into a place filled with monsters from the Abyss, as well as Melchizedek\u2019s soldiers.</p><br/><p>It was one heck of a way to commit suicide.</p><br/><p>Those weren\u2019t even all the forces within the city.</p><br/><p>Apparently, it was now a place to create those transcendents.</p><br/><p>There was definitely a large number of those artificial transcendents crawling around the area as well.</p><br/><p>\u2018Please\u2026 please just let me go.\u2019</p><br/><p>If they let him go, then he just needed to use the armored vehicle in the distance and run away.</p><br/><p>According to what he found out after connecting to the database, these aliens had to use the elevators to move between the areas, but he and the other natives didn\u2019t need to.</p><br/><p>They could move about freely.</p><br/><p>\u2018I just need to meet up with the Kalkuroun Fleet after I run away.\u2019</p><br/><p>A happy ending.</p><br/><p>As long as these guys let him go.</p><br/><p>As R-Korun Nell prayed inside his mind.</p><br/><p>Kiriel spoke to Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat shall we do? It doesn\u2019t sound easy.\u201d</p><br/><p>It looked like the preparations above wouldn\u2019t be simple.</p><br/><p>Melchizedek wasn\u2019t stupid either; it would be preparing even more.</p><br/><p>Since it would expect its enemy to climb up from below.</p><br/><p>\u2018It might even have prepared something by the entrance.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo then looked at R-Korun Nell.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to have to help us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...Please, no. You damned creatures! I don\u2019t even have the Dragon God Armor, what can I even do to help?!\u201d</p><br/><p>R-Korun Nell only had on a layer of clothing he found on the Melkasus, and had no weapons or armor of any sort.</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t they just say that it wouldn\u2019t be easy?</p><br/><p>If monsters like them were going to have a hard time, what would he, who didn\u2019t even have the Dragon God Armor anymore, be able to do?</p><br/><p>Although the Melkasus had basic weapons, those wouldn\u2019t be enough to take care of a few of Melchizedek\u2019s mass-produced machines.</p><br/><p>Hansoo chuckled.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, there\u2019s something only you can do.\u201d</p><br/><p>He and the other humans couldn\u2019t, but there was something that R-Korun could do as a native of this place.</p><br/><p>Hansoo then gazed towards the skeletal Enbi Arin and thought to himself:</p><br/><p>\u2018Just wait a bit longer.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s prepare, since we have to go through the elevator.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked towards the distance, at the Elevator heading towards the middle of Nelkipa.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014 </p><br/><p>The giant city, Aokan.</p><br/><p>The centermost area of Aokan, an area that maintained its stability with gravitational mechanisms and supporting structures.</p><br/><p>Located at the top of the city\u2019s central structure, , Melchizedek\u2019s hologram frowned as it looked down at the city.</p><br/><p>No, it looked towards a distant location beyond the city.</p><br/><p>\u2018I wonder\u2026 did she win?\u2019</p><br/><p>It had lost control over the Main Research Center as well as the product he had so painstakingly created.</p><br/><p>There were actually a few more 2-Star transcendents.</p><br/><p>But she was the only one that had the willpower to withstand the it had dug up from deep within.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t know what had happened to its secret weapon.</p><br/><p>Although it had sent something over to check, the train was already nowhere in sight.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Nothing is going according to plan.\u2019</p><br/><p>Melchizedek grit its teeth.</p><br/><p>Its mother had given it a lot of emotions so it could connect and understand the other beings better, but that wasn\u2019t always a good thing.</p><br/><p>If it didn\u2019t have emotions, then it wouldn\u2019t have needed this war for revenge.</p><br/><p>It wouldn\u2019t tremble in fear of the unknown due to some uncontrollable variable.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ugh, at least I\u2019ve prepared everything. I just\u2026 need to finish up.\u2019</p><br/><p>Melchizedek chuckled as it looked towards the Kalkuroun Fleet in the sky that was carefully scanning the area.</p><br/><p>From the encirclement around the elevator to the preparations made against the Kalkuroun Fleet.</p><br/><p>Since the humans could only use the elevator, it just needed to make preparations around it and just stop them there.</p><br/><p>At that moment\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014kuooooo!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014the elevator made a loud noise as it rose up.</p><br/><p>\u2018Are they coming? Took longer than I expected.\u2019</p><br/><p>Melchizedek chuckled coldly.</p><br/><p>Three days had already passed.</p><br/><p>It had almost died of boredom, but thanks to that period of time, it had been able to prepare even further.</p><br/><p>But as it laughed\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014\u2019s detection system scanned something unusual in the vicinity.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hmm?\u2019</p><br/><p>Nelkipa was releasing a strange aura, severely reducing Mimir\u2019s detection ability.</p><br/><p>And this was what scared him the most.</p><br/><p>If something the size of those powerful humans could manage to hide from their sensors, it had no way of detecting or guarding against them.</p><br/><p>But the thing approaching the city was not that small.</p><br/><p>It was the size of a mountain.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>Melchizedek\u2019s expression turned ugly.</p><br/><p>\u201c...You really like fancy fireworks, huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Maybe there was something wrong with its system of emotion.</p><br/><p>Since it could never understand the crazy acts that humans did.</p><br/><p>\u2014ooooooooo!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Melchizedek clenched its teeth as it stared towards the distance, at the Main Research Center charging straight for Aokan.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

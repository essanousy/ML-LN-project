Anyone can tell that he looks pissed off.\u2019</p><br/><p>Karhal nervously looked at the face the size of a large house.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo replied leisurely.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re thinking of going to the Birdcage then it\u2019ll be a useless death. Are you trying to commit suicide?\u201d</p><br/><p>He could tell from the direction Junghwan was trying to head towards.</p><br/><p>The area between the outer regions of the Green Road and the Arukon\u2019s territory, the playground and the aquarium of the Higher Races.</p><br/><p>Hansoo knew the moment he saw Junghwan trying to run towards the Birdcage after he gained power and the clan\u2019s symbol disappeared.</p><br/><p>That someone precious to him had been captured and taken from him.</p><br/><p>Junghwan stopped at those words.</p><br/><p>Suicide.</p><br/><p>&lt;\u2026&gt;</p><br/><p>His consciousness came back slightly from Hansoo\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Though he had gained a tremendous amount of strength, his opponent was not simple.</p><br/><p>Seriously.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026Could I do it?\u2019</p><br/><p>He ran the possibility of him charging into the his sibling was in and rescuing him through his mind several times but the more he thought about it the more nervous he felt.</p><br/><p>He realized this after being hit by the Akion.</p><br/><p>He was not invincible.</p><br/><p>The location he had been hit was still hurting.</p><br/><p>The Akion, which was a bit weaker than the Satellite Fortress, was this much already.</p><br/><p>If he were to hit by multiple Satellite Fortresses, which each shot multiple shots like this, would he be able to survive?</p><br/><p>He wouldn\u2019t be.</p><br/><p>No, even if he rescued his sibling what would he do?</p><br/><p>His strength was time-limited and his sibling will die the moment he died.</p><br/><p>Even if he rescued his brother from the Birdcage he wouldn\u2019t be able to take him to the portal at the end of the Green Road.</p><br/><p>Junghwan started to calm down and made a despair-stricken expression.</p><br/><p>Whooooshhh</p><br/><p>A gale caused by a sigh came out from the giant Demonic Beast\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>Hansoo spoke towards Junghwan.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo just instead of doing something stupid, just help me. If you help me I\u2019ll take care of the rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>&lt;\u2026What are you going to do?&gt;</p><br/><p>Hansoo laughed as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll rescue the people in the Birdcage for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He needed to attack to Birdcage anyway.</p><br/><p>Since Metiron was hidden below the Birdcage.</p><br/><p>Get rid of Metiron who will get in the way of him getting the Destruction Jade at the Birdcage.</p><br/><p>Then activate the Destruction Jade.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you cause a ruckus with your huge body you\u2019d fail but\u2026 I can do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>&lt;\u2026&gt;</p><br/><p>\u201cSo just help me, you know right? Where they hid the Destruction Jade.\u201d</p><br/><p>It\u2019d be better to squeeze out the location of the Destruction Jade from Metiron but he had to prepare for a situation where Metiron would refuse to speak.</p><br/><p>Since everything will have been useless if he couldn\u2019t find the Destruction Jade.</p><br/><p>Junghwan nodded at those words.</p><br/><p>He knew.</p><br/><p>Them, together as a clan, were set up so they couldn\u2019t betray each other and so they had shared all the information with each other.</p><br/><p>If something like this hadn\u2019t happened then he wouldn\u2019t have been able to even dream about telling anything to Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u2018If this guy really activated the Destruction Jade\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>There was an actual possibility.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026Well, I\u2019ll die too but that doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019</p><br/><p>If mana disappeared then he, who moved from mana, would stop and his conscious would fade as well but that didn\u2019t matter.</p><br/><p>His soul will burn up eventually, it happening a bit sooner doesn\u2019t matter.</p><br/><p>If somebody as big as him charged in then countless Satellite Fortresses would charge in but someone like Hansoo could get in without getting caught.</p><br/><p>Even to Metiron under the Birdcage.</p><br/><p>But there was a problem.</p><br/><p>Junghwan quietly looked at Hansoo and then lifted his hands.</p><br/><p>Then he smashed the two huge hands downwards.</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>\u201cUwaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>Karhal almost fell down from shock but unlike his fears, the giant hands didn\u2019t squish him flat or anything.</p><br/><p>It was actually the opposite.</p><br/><p>The giant hand of Junghwan was actually surrounding them.</p><br/><p>As if he was protecting them like they were a small chick.</p><br/><p>Of course that wasn\u2019t what was intended.</p><br/><p>While he spoke Junghwan moved his outwards and inwards as if he could crush them at any moment.</p><br/><p>Implying that he would kill them the moment they said something funny.</p><br/><p>Hansoo laughed as he looked at Junghwan.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have a method. Oh and there\u2019s something you need to do for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>Booooom!</p><br/><p>\u2018Fucking bastard! Just buy time? If you fail I\u2019m going to fucking kill you!\u2019</p><br/><p>He had been persuaded back then but he started to curse Hansoo as he felt the pain from the Satellite Fortress\u2019s assault.</p><br/><p>Since it was much harder and more dangerous than he had expected.</p><br/><p>Booom!</p><br/><p>Junghwan kicked the fortress pushing him from the acceleration of the mana engine as he rebalanced himself and lifted his right hand up in order to smash the Satellite Fortress again.</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>The claws that had flown high up into the skies fell down as they sliced away the surface of the Satellite Fortress.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Kiiiiing!</p><br/><p>Countless attacks shot towards Junghwan who had become defenseless from the large attack.</p><br/><p>Booooom! Boom!</p><br/><p>\u2018Fuck!\u2019</p><br/><p>Junghwan grinded his teeth while balancing himself.</p><br/><p>The single Satellite Fortress was pushing him back even whilst becoming a mess in order to buy time.</p><br/><p>It was clear to Junghwan what it was doing.</p><br/><p>It was buying time.</p><br/><p>But he laughed coldly.</p><br/><p>\u2018You damned bastard. I\u2019m the same as well.\u2019</p><br/><p>Junghwan saw the Satellite Fortresses coming in from the distance, roared loudly and then jumped into the skies.</p><br/><p>Booom!</p><br/><p>The surrounding land trembled from the giant body jumping into the skies.</p><br/><p>Junghwan, after jumping into the skies, used both hands to smash the mana engine of the Satellite Fortress while falling down.</p><br/><p>Boooooom!</p><br/><p>The hammer created from his two hands caused the entire Satellite Fortress to tremble.</p><br/><p>Rumble!</p><br/><p>The Satellite Fortress, which had turned into quite a mess, couldn\u2019t handle the tremendous force pushing it down as it crashed down onto the ground.</p><br/><p>Junghwan tried to spit as he destroyed a Satellite Fortress but then realized he wasn\u2019t an living being anymore as he drove his claws into the Satellite Fortress with a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>Crunch!</p><br/><p>He pulled out the mana engine that was filled with mana crystals and devoured it as he refilled his used up energy.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fucking hell\u2026Isn\u2019t this a bit too well made? I feel exhausted already.\u2019</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t physical.</p><br/><p>It was mental exhaustion from controlling this humongous wolfman.</p><br/><p>Since he could feel his soul burning up.</p><br/><p>\u2018I think I\u2019ll die.\u2019</p><br/><p>As energy refilled, the damaged body quickly fixed itself and recovered.</p><br/><p>Suuuuurururk</p><br/><p>The broken arm fixed itself as the metal bits that fell off flew back in and recombined onto the body.</p><br/><p>If it had enough energy and Junghwan\u2019s soul remained intact then this monster could fight like an immortal.</p><br/><p>Of course those two things were the biggest issues.</p><br/><p>The body was fine but he still felt like he would fall down.</p><br/><p>But he couldn\u2019t stop here.</p><br/><p>Since he had made a contract with Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u2018They\u2019re\u2026Coming.\u2019</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Whooooosh!</p><br/><p>He could see two Satellite Fortress approaching towards him from across the horizon.</p><br/><p>It was clear that the ones patrolling around the Birdcage were hurriedly flying towards this location.</p><br/><p>\u2018They won\u2019t give me any time to rest huh.\u2019</p><br/><p>He had caused a ruckus around the Birdcage in order to pull these guys out on purpose.</p><br/><p>Though he had achieved his goal, he started to feel a bit pressured facing two when one was hard already.</p><br/><p>He watched the Satellite Fortresses approaching him slowly, grinded his teeth and prepared himself.</p><br/><p>Since he needed to fulfill his part.</p><br/><p>That was the only method for success.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damned bastard. You have to succeed. If not\u2026It\u2019ll be the end of you as well.\u2019</p><br/><p>He thought of the prohibition that Hansoo thought of and mumbled while thinking about his sibling.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Hey, are you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Karhal made a confused expression while looking at the liquid metal squirming around Hansoo\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>The metal that had separated from Junghwan\u2019s body had surrounded Hansoo\u2019s body like armor and was constantly squirming around.</p><br/><p>It looked like it was protecting Hansoo and it was indeed doing so but Karhal knew what purpose it had.</p><br/><p>It was the evidence of Hansoo and Junghwan\u2019s contract.</p><br/><p>If Hansoo did as he wanted then the liquid metal around his body will try to penetrate into his heart and brain.</p><br/><p>Hansoo replied nonchalantly at Karhal.</p><br/><p>\u201cI need to at least do this much in order to make him move.</p><br/><p>If he hadn\u2019t done this much then Junghwan wouldn\u2019t have believed him and instead would have charged into this place.</p><br/><p>Towards the Birdcage he could see in the distance.</p><br/><p>A 15m-tall tower that seemed tiny from the outside.</p><br/><p>But Karhal, who had checked the intel in Dakidus\u2019s Satellite Fortress, knew.</p><br/><p>That it was merely the entrance.</p><br/><p>The true structure of the humongous underground structure that spread out multiple kilometers wide.</p><br/><p>Birdcage.</p><br/><p>One of the King\u2019s favorite resorts.</p><br/><p>The King watched the humans the Hunting Dogs caught for him and enjoyed his time there.</p><br/><p>Along with countless other Arukons.</p><br/><p>Usually a Birdcage was just for watching but that giant Birdcage had many things used to play around with humans as well as using the humans as snacks.</p><br/><p>The three races were usually hostile against each other but in there they were all quite friendly as they enjoyed their time.</p><br/><p>One of the only locations where the three races found peace with each other.</p><br/><p>\u2018Anyway\u2026For the Destruction Jade to be with Metiron.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo mumbled as he thought of the Destruction Jade\u2019s location he heard from Junghwan.</p><br/><p>Eres had told him how it looked like in the past but Hansoo didn\u2019t have a method of knowing where it had gone after it fell into Clementine\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>He had thought that they would\u2019ve hidden it somewhere but for Metiron to have it in person.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well. That\u2019s not bad really.\u2019</p><br/><p>From what he had heard, the Destruction Jade was a very small object.</p><br/><p>Even smaller than the Sealing Jade he had in the past.</p><br/><p>Since it wasn\u2019t hard to carry it around, it was better to hold onto it so they could use it in times of emergencies.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo spoke towards the Birdcage.</p><br/><p>He just needed to kill Metiron hiding below the Birdcage and activate the Destruction Jade.</p><br/><p>Karhal asked Hansoo at those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, it should be easier this time around since our opponents are humans right?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was hard to imagine that a human could be stronger than the Satellite Fortress or the Judge they had fought.</p><br/><p>Though there were quite a lot of Arukons inside the Birdcage, the liquid metal around Hansoo\u2019s body was quite good at hiding from their senses to a degree so the thing they had to be cautious of the most were humans.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell\u2026They aren\u2019t pushovers.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mad Monarch\u2019s* underlings, Dark Lords.</p><br/><p>And one of them.</p><br/><p>Though he had the power of a lord, he was far beyond normal lords in terms of strength and thanks to the power of his trait.</p><br/><p>Hansoo frowned as he thought of Metiron, the Dark General.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Below the Birdcage.</p><br/><p>Metiron, who had a extremely dark ring on his hand, frowned while listening to the reports.</p><br/><p>\u2018White a ruckus.\u2019</p><br/><p>And thousands of people were gathered around Metiron.</p><br/><p>People who had gathered from the sudden movements of the Satellite Fortress.</p><br/><p>Metiron mumbled after hearing the reports from Karon who had escaped while being surrounded by countless amounts of people lined up perfectly around him as if they were soldiers in an army.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026The Maze got destroyed completely? And this is what happened afterwards?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow strange. What the hell happened there? Why are these crazy bastards trying to kill us all?\u201d</p><br/><p>Metiron then looked towards the Arukon laying on the ground in the distance.</p><br/><p>A 6m large body and armor that looked quite good.</p><br/><p>Around the Arukon, who seemed to have a high position, there were corpses of tens of other Arukons as well.</p><br/><p>A scene that was impossible to even imagine if one thought about the differences between an Arukon and humans.</p><br/><p>But this was the reality.</p><br/><p>\u201cA King shouldn\u2019t go crazy in front of us yeah? If you came to a resort then you should just enjoy yourself and leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrrr\u2026You fucking viper-like bastard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you are going to hit us from the back then do it properly like me. This is what happens when you leave loose ends.\u201d</p><br/><p>Metiron laughed coldly as he looked at the owner of the Birdcage that they had caught, the Arukon\u2019s King.</p><br/><p>*This was a TL mistake on my part. Mad Monarch = Gwang Goonju = Light Monarch. The korean word of \uad11\uad70\uc8fc, Gwang Goonju is how one pronounces it. I first thought it was a name. Light Monarch/ Mad Monarch were created because \uad11 can mean both madness and light. The translation of mad makes the most sense since he\u2019s quite crazy and though he should honestly be called a Mad Lord, since Lord is the trait, I\u2019ll keep it Mad Monarch unless you guys prefer Mad Lord. Sorry for the mistranslation and I hope this cleared up some things.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m an NPC. Damned bastards.\u2019</p><br/><p>He knew that if she had said something like this then he would\u2019ve been suspicious of her anyway.</p><br/><p>He knew better than anyone else that there was nothing special about him.</p><br/><p>He had shone where he had come from amongst people of 40 to 50 years old because it was quite laid back and had come here with his confidence after investing a large amount of money but he was merely the lowest of the food chain here.</p><br/><p>\u2018I have to take this chance.\u2019</p><br/><p>Ecliptic Mania tightly held onto the mysterious gem and then mumbled.</p><br/><p>The female\u2019s request was actually very simple.</p><br/><p>&lt;...Yes. But I heard there wasn\u2019t much there.&gt;</p><br/><p>The female continued.</p><br/><p>That he just needed to pour mana into the gem inside the altar.</p><br/><p>\u2018So. She\u2019s going to allow me to play around at a decent hunting ground in the Korin Kingdom huh? As well as contribution points.\u2019</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t bad.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t how bad the things he would do here would be but it\u2019ll probably become troublesome to move around in the Keil Kingdom from now on.</p><br/><p>But it didn\u2019t matter.</p><br/><p>Since even if he died here, he could just revive in the Korin Kingdom and play there.</p><br/><p>Though he would lose the rights to use the War Fortress, the hottest place, he had long accepted the fact.</p><br/><p>That there was no place for him here.</p><br/><p>Well, there would be a place for him if he played long enough but he didn\u2019t like the idea of waiting that long.</p><br/><p>He wanted to climb faster, he wanted to become a master player.</p><br/><p>And he wanted to join those people in their respective battlefields and shine.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yeah. This isn\u2019t the only place in this game. I can just go to the next most famous hunting ground.\u2019</p><br/><p>As soon as he finished his thought.</p><br/><p>Whooosh!</p><br/><p>Ecliptic Mania poured mana into the gem in his hand.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>Rumble</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kameia stopped at the strange noise and the vibration that suddenly rang out.</p><br/><p>And then spoke out.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you just do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ecliptic Mania chuckled.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do I have to reply do that?\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t even like her, why did he have to answer?</p><br/><p>And even if he answered her question, he didn\u2019t know what would happen from now on anyway.</p><br/><p>Other people were making uneasy expressions but he himself was extremely excited.</p><br/><p>Since he was curious as to what he had done would cause.</p><br/><p>Kiiiiiing!</p><br/><p>But the vibration wasn\u2019t the end.</p><br/><p>Light exploded out from Ecliptic Mania.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Hey! What are you doing over there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn! What the hell are you doing!?\u201d</p><br/><p>The guards were approaching in shock but then started to scream.</p><br/><p>Though they were guards, they were strong enough to determine the amount of mana within that light.</p><br/><p>Such a tremendous reaction.</p><br/><p>If such a thing exploded then the surrounding area would all be erased.</p><br/><p>And another thing.</p><br/><p>They would all die.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fucking crazy immortals.\u2019</p><br/><p>Guard, Moreum, made an expression of despair.</p><br/><p>Each individual here were beasts filled with the desire to get stronger even by risking their lives.</p><br/><p>And such guys had the weapon called immortality.</p><br/><p>Immortality and desire.</p><br/><p>These players had done things that were extremely monstrous.</p><br/><p>And Moreum made an expression filled with despair, he would die but they wouldn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>For him to lose his life from their toyous acts without knowing the reason.</p><br/><p>He wanted to scream out.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fucking bastards! Don\u2019t play with us! We are...We\u2019re different from you guys!\u2019</p><br/><p>Moreum grinded his teeth.</p><br/><p>But he knew he couldn\u2019t</p><br/><p>Since there were rules which existed in this world.</p><br/><p>A secret from the immortals.</p><br/><p>They were merely existences who were created for those immortals.</p><br/><p>Kiiiiiiingg!</p><br/><p>The gem on Ecliptic Mania which was shining brightly and vibrating intensely was now even letting out a huge roar.</p><br/><p>And the sensation that was radiating out from it.</p><br/><p>\u2018So that\u2019s what that is. The thing which used the to create\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Moreum thought up to this point and then gave up his life.</p><br/><p>Since it was impossible to escape it\u2019s vicinity.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is the end. Stay well captain.\u2019</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Booooooooooooom!</p><br/><p>A huge explosion swept through the insides of the altar.</p><br/><p>A large amount of destructive force.</p><br/><p>The inferno swept through the entire altar.</p><br/><p>Rumble!</p><br/><p>The skulls that were on the walls of the Pyramid couldn\u2019t handle the heat as they all melted down.</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuuuhaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>The surrounding players tried to quickly use their defensive skills but it was useless.</p><br/><p>They treated this world as a game and they could revive anyway.</p><br/><p>The tremendous amount of energy melted down their body and caused them to log out.</p><br/><p>Along with Kameia who was next to it.</p><br/><p>The moment Kameia and all other players melted down from the light.</p><br/><p>\u2018They\u2019re all dead.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo realized that everyone else died and his body started to move about.</p><br/><p>Churrrrrrrk.</p><br/><p>If course Hansoo\u2019s body was also melting down since he was the closest to the flame.</p><br/><p>But the durability of his body, the mana he had and his skills were different from those of the others.</p><br/><p>Whooooosh!</p><br/><p>The Demonic Dragon\u2019s Essence fired up from Hansoo\u2019s body and started to resist the light that was smashing into him.</p><br/><p>Chiiijijijiiik.</p><br/><p>The melting body restructured again and started to resist the energy.</p><br/><p>At the same time Hansoo\u2019s brain started to work quickly.</p><br/><p>A ability which utilized his battle experience.</p><br/><p>Once he used this then everything around him would look as if they had all stopped.</p><br/><p>\u2018Phew, So I need to use at least this amount of mana to use this huh.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo mumbled as he felt the Mana Jade that was rotating intensely.</p><br/><p>Of course it wasn\u2019t like he could move quickly in this stopped world but the fact that he could think and judge clearly at normal speed was a tremendous bonus.</p><br/><p>First he saw the skulls melting down.</p><br/><p>They were resisting the flame because they had some special mana inside of them but they would soon melt.</p><br/><p>And the one Hansoo targeted was resisting it more but would also soon melt down.</p><br/><p>Maybe about a second in real lief time.</p><br/><p>And there were three guards below the explosion who had instinctively rolled up.</p><br/><p>Residents of this world.</p><br/><p>They would die at this rate.</p><br/><p>Of course he didn\u2019t really have any thoughts of saving them but he was feeling responsible now.</p><br/><p>Since he had left the guy in front of him alone from causing the explosion.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t have a reason to not stop him from causing the explosion and he probably could\u2019ve if he tried but he did not.</p><br/><p>Since it was a chance for him.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ll take the skull with this chance.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s judgement, which was clear in the stopped world, laid down a decision.</p><br/><p>It would\u2019ve been very annoying originally.</p><br/><p>Since there would\u2019ve been being chasing him if he stole the skull at night.</p><br/><p>But the story would change with this explosion.</p><br/><p>Since it would be even weirder if a skull remained after this explosion.</p><br/><p>Even if he took a single skull from all this, nothing would change.</p><br/><p>In an instant.</p><br/><p>Boooooom!</p><br/><p>The stopped world started to move again at original speed.</p><br/><p>The explosion swept through the surroundings and headed towards the guards.</p><br/><p>Hansoo quickly moved his body, blocked the explosion and smashed his foot down onto the ground.</p><br/><p>Kwaaagagagagaaak!</p><br/><p>The ground was forcibly ripped up.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo kicked the raised land towards the three guards.</p><br/><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><br/><p>The broken floor of the pyramid smashed onto the guards and then pushed them out of the tunnel.</p><br/><p>At a speed which they wouldn\u2019t have been able to by running.</p><br/><p>\u2018That\u2019s good.\u2019</p><br/><p>Since they had been in front of the tunnel which headed outside and were far away from the explosion, it acted as fortune for them.</p><br/><p>Though they would get burned, they would be able to escape the explosion radius.</p><br/><p>Since the force of the explosion and the impact of the floor piece of pushing them back.</p><br/><p>Like a tsunami pushing back a surfboard.</p><br/><p>Hansoo, after smashing away the floor piece, then jumped towards the ceiling.</p><br/><p>Booooom!</p><br/><p>He then plucked the skull that was embedded on the ceiling and then shoved it down by his waist.</p><br/><p>He then started to resist the flame with all his mana.</p><br/><p>Kuooooooo!</p><br/><p>Kuuuguguguguuungg!</p><br/><p>The bomb Ecliptic Mania brought was powerful but it wasn\u2019t strong enough to get through Hansoo\u2019s Demonic Dragon\u2019s Reinforcement.</p><br/><p>If the others were higher level players then they might\u2019ve been able to block it.</p><br/><p>Rumble.</p><br/><p>As the flames quieted down, Hansoo released his hand which he had smashed into the ceiling and then landed down onto the ground.</p><br/><p>All his surroundings had turned into ashes.</p><br/><p>The players and the skulls in the walls had all melted down and then turned black.</p><br/><p>A tremendous might.</p><br/><p>\u2018For them to use the Spirit Stones already to create this amount of force.\u2019</p><br/><p>As Hansoo was mumbling.</p><br/><p>Piiiiiing!</p><br/><p>The red gem, which had maintained its shape through the explosion, started to make a ringing noise.</p><br/><p>\u2018So their objective was to release the seal of that thing.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo mumbled as he looked at the sealed red gem, the .</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Rumble.</p><br/><p>A red flame exploded out from the pyramid as a strange vibration rang throughout the Level 1 Supply Zone.</p><br/><p>The man who was swinging his blade, Flame Warrior-V, flinched at this vibration.</p><br/><p>Of course his blade didn\u2019t stop because of this.</p><br/><p>Crunch!</p><br/><p>\u201cGod damn. It\u2019s annoying as hell to kill them one by one. Why are they so loyal to each other.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Flame Warrior-V cut apart the neck of the woman who had held him down until the end a few more times and then watched the bug players running towards the pyramid as he smiled.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know what was going on but one thing was clear.</p><br/><p>\u2018Try a bit more heheh.\u2019</p><br/><p>He could catch them.</p><br/><p>But his experience told him.</p><br/><p>That bug players would look for other bug players when they fell into danger.</p><br/><p>\u2018Dumbasses. It\u2019s not like they really die.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cChase them!\u201d</p><br/><p>The other players plucked away the artifacts from the corpse and then ran after the bug players while laughing.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

And nobody else can handle things like this.\u2019</p><br/><p>There were plenty of powerful people she could trust in battles.</p><br/><p>But power wasn\u2019t enough to control such a large organization.</p><br/><p>People like Sofia or Karhal weren\u2019t suited for management and though Ekidu had experience controlling a village, she had never managed such a large organization either.</p><br/><p>And it was the same for the others.</p><br/><p>There was a huge difference between personal strength and managing a huge organization properly.</p><br/><p>And Enbi Arin was one of the small minority who could do such a thing.</p><br/><p>Since she had the experience of managing the clan, one of the giant clans which ruled over the Orange Zone.</p><br/><p>If there weren\u2019t for the managers of huge clans and herself, this huge organization would\u2019ve long imploded.</p><br/><p>But with the Mana Pool and the Body Enhancement Surgery she had received, instead of beating up their enemies she really wanted to beat down the people in front of her.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no point in being angry. Just persuade us. Why do we have to fight?\u201d</p><br/><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><br/><p>One of the Ten Thousand Men Captain, which was one of the highest positions in their quickly created rank system, Samuel Kinar.</p><br/><p>He had been in charge of the middle management in the Rerorerore clan in the giant clan of the Orange Zone and was an expert in management and was powerful as well.</p><br/><p>She originally had great trust on him because he had always watched what came out of his mouth right now he was really getting on her nerves.</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin spoke in words what the other captains were implying.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo\u2026 You want us to leave behind the Ains and just depart?\u201d</p><br/><p>This was what the others wanted.</p><br/><p>To leave the Ains behind and escape.</p><br/><p>Away from the forces of the Kingdoms and the Empire approaching him.</p><br/><p>And Samuel nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Crack.</p><br/><p>The handle of golden sword in her hand crunched apart.</p><br/><p>Though it was an artifact created from the efforts of masters from the lower zone, it could not withstand her strength which had been severely increased due to her .</p><br/><p>\u201cYou understand what your words are right?\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just leaving behind the Ains.</p><br/><p>Without the Ains, there was no future for the people who would come after them.</p><br/><p>Without the Ain\u2019s Protection, they would all freeze to death before they could level up.</p><br/><p>Samuel flinched at Enbi Arin\u2019s words but didn\u2019t back off.</p><br/><p>\u201cHonestly there are indeed more people below. But to me, the ten thousand lives I lead are more important than all of them. If we collide now then I don\u2019t know how many would die out of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>They had seen with their own eyes.</p><br/><p>Great General, Cyrkus.</p><br/><p>They had seen how powerful his elite soldiers were.</p><br/><p>And level 400 was not something they, who hadn\u2019t even reached level 250, could handle.</p><br/><p>Even if they won, they would receive a huge amount of casualties.</p><br/><p>And there was a way for them to guarantee their lives.</p><br/><p>Use the Ains as bait and then climb up after leveling up from the deepest parts of the Spirit Land.</p><br/><p>In a situation where the people of the Empire and the Kingdoms had no reason to attack them, there was no reason for them to fight for the Ains.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fuck\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin frowned as she looked at Samuel\u2019s resolute expression.</p><br/><p>\u2018It was much better when the Spirit Land was here. Fuck. Hansoo please help me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin thought of Hansoo as she mumbled.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you see them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ekidu frowned as she looked at the people who were clamouring in the distance.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ugh...How embarrassing.\u2019</p><br/><p>And it was the same for Karhal.</p><br/><p>Their faces had long turned red from embarrassment.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fucking bastards. They should at least just do it quietly.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cI really feel bad for mister Hansoo. For him to move around with these people. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s your mother\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>And the moment Karhal heard her words he splurted out in anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you saying, Hansoo is raising them because they are still useful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Though she had excluded him in the \u2018they\u2019, he knew he was a part of it.</p><br/><p>\u2018And it\u2019s not like our meeting was that smooth.\u2019</p><br/><p>If it was up to him, he would just kill off the ones who he should and take the ones he needed.</p><br/><p>He would focus on power and materials.</p><br/><p>And his own opinion wasn\u2019t that different from Clementine\u2019s minion.</p><br/><p>But there was a reason why he followed Hansoo\u2019s opinion instead.</p><br/><p>Since Hansoo\u2019s method was much better in the long run if they could control them properly.</p><br/><p>And they had been able to control them well up until now.</p><br/><p>\u2018I guess it\u2019s all up to one\u2019s own abilities.\u2019</p><br/><p>And from what he could see, Hansoo had more than enough rights to use such a method.</p><br/><p>Karhal shouted towards Mudusella as he looked at the golden army in the distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook, even that captain leads an army around despite his strength. It\u2019s not like you live in this world all alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Becoming stronger as they became bigger was a given.</p><br/><p>And the friction that occured from this was the price for this strength.</p><br/><p>\u2018There\u2019s no such thing as an organization who\u2019s always in peace. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re robots.\u2019</p><br/><p>But Mudusella\u2019s smile became even brighter at his words.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...What are you trying to say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mudusella chuckled as she continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo where did you use them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...What?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m asking if there was really a time where you guys were needed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...\u201d</p><br/><p>Karhal couldn\u2019t refute her words.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Right. Where is he trying to use us?\u2019</p><br/><p>It should be natural for somebody to want to use the power of a group once they created it.</p><br/><p>Even if it was more efficient to act alone, it was safer to move in a group.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo\u2019s actions up until now were clearly different.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s like he really is our carer\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Mudusella kept smiling as she continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom what I hear, everything you guys have around you is from him\u2026 And he even has to feed you. He needs to think of the cost of maintenance but he had no use for you...But it\u2019s not like you guys will listen just because he gives out rewards. And it\u2019s not like you\u2019re that precious to that man? You guys don\u2019t really seem that close.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...\u201d</p><br/><p>Karhal and Ekidu\u2019s faces turned gloomier and gloomier as Mudusella\u2019s words stabbed into their hearts.</p><br/><p>Though they wanted to refute, they couldn\u2019t say anything because of the people bickering behind them.</p><br/><p>Mudusella continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone has a need for some measure of enjoyment and contentment. Have you ever seen him search for such a thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...\u201d</p><br/><p>Ekidu and Karhal shook their heads.</p><br/><p>They actually had talked about this in the past.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not like humans were machines, one would clearly break down if they continuously ran around 24 hours a day.</p><br/><p>But this was exactly what Hansoo was doing.</p><br/><p>And it wasn\u2019t like he was looking for his own enjoyment.</p><br/><p>He could easily live like a king by ruling over the adventurers.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not like he needed to risk his life or face a powerful enemy immediately.</p><br/><p>But from his own actions\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t he like a worker ant? So I became curious\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>There was two reasons for one to work hard to the point of even destroying their own body.</p><br/><p>Either there was a huge, unbelievable reward.</p><br/><p>Or.</p><br/><p>\u2018Somebody forced him.\u2019</p><br/><p>But Karhal shouted in rage from her words.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way! Who can force him to do anything!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Who could force Hansoo to do things?</p><br/><p>Even if there was somebody, there was plenty of chances for him to escape their grasp.</p><br/><p>Since he was alone most of the time.</p><br/><p>Mudusella laughed coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m curious about that as well. So\u2026 I\u2019m going to help out a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt should be done about now.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>Kuooooooo.</p><br/><p>In the distance.</p><br/><p>Something started to fly up above the mountain range.</p><br/><p>\u2018...That is?\u2019</p><br/><p>A huge steel ship that was letting out light.</p><br/><p>Karhal and Ekidu frowned as they watched the giant ship approaching them.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>\u2018...Do we just need to beat him up like this?\u2019</p><br/><p>Since ASTRO-1 will move to its destination on its own, he just needed to do this.</p><br/><p>But beating up a guy whose body hadn\u2019t even healed up wasn\u2019t very fun.</p><br/><p>TMT-1 made a bored expression while beating up Hansoo with his light blade.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well. If he dies then whatever.\u2019</p><br/><p>There were no orders to deal with him carefully.</p><br/><p>He had just been told to drive him to near death.</p><br/><p>Though Hansoo was holding on very well, he needed to perform his first job now.</p><br/><p>Kiiiiiiiing!</p><br/><p>As TMT-1 gathered up energy to smash for his final attack.</p><br/><p>Craack.</p><br/><p>Crunch.</p><br/><p>\u201c...?\u201d</p><br/><p>TMT-1 stopped at the strange noises coming out from Hansoo who was kneeling on the ground.</p><br/><p>A strange change.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Hansoo slowly rose up.</p><br/><p>With a completely different expression from before.</p><br/><p>A small mumble came out from his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201c...Eres. Keldian.\u201d</p><br/><p>His broken memories surfaced.</p><br/><p>Fixing the broken cracks inside him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you were asking for a favor\u2026 You should\u2019ve just told me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Craaack.</p><br/><p>Cruunch.</p><br/><p>As he heard the frightening noises all over his body.</p><br/><p>Hansoo smiled.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

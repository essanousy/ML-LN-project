We have to go!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou may not!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese bastards\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Karhal grinded his teeth.</p><br/><p>Even a neutral ground would be annoying but for them to be like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t ask you to help so get lost!\u201d</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>Then one of the guards who had swung their sword against Karhal shouted out.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way. Kang Hansoo. Blame that guy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is all because of that bastard, Kang Hansoo! That damned bastard\u2026 If he hadn\u2019t caused a problem then everything would\u2019ve continued the way it was!\u201d</p><br/><p>And with this as the start, a few others started to shout out as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did that bitch start all this!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe should\u2019ve just lived the way he was!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mackill grinded her teeth as she saw this.</p><br/><p>Including the guard who was shouting right now, about 10% of the people here were attacking in all directions.</p><br/><p>Though the number was only 10%, the power was closer to 50% of what they had.</p><br/><p>Since most of the attackers were Hunters and Guards.</p><br/><p>Even without mana, they were still much stronger than the Farmers.</p><br/><p>High rankers who had been stomping all over the Farmers from a safe location while gaining benefits from the village during the peace the village had been maintaining.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damned bastards. You were safe.\u2019</p><br/><p>Mackill barely dodged an attack of a Hunter who was charging at her and then grinded her teeth.</p><br/><p>There was a reason for her anger.</p><br/><p>Even if the village continued the way it was, there weren\u2019t that many negative points for those higher up.</p><br/><p>They wouldn\u2019t be picked for the offerings even if they stayed still and even if Dakidus\u2019 words were right, they had a high chance of just passing through the numerous tests Clementine had set up and going up to the next zone.</p><br/><p>It was very possible for those around the level of a guard.</p><br/><p>But due to the recent events, they didn\u2019t know what would happen from now on.</p><br/><p>Of course the Farmers couldn\u2019t really relate.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bastards. Was the peace you had made by selling us that good?\u2019</p><br/><p>No, it wasn\u2019t peace that was created just by selling them.</p><br/><p>It was peace created by selling everyone who hadn\u2019t been able to pass the test created by Clementine.</p><br/><p>Peace only for those who have passed.</p><br/><p>But the minds of the guards swinging their blades against Mackill weren\u2019t easy either.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t from fighting against other humans.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn\u2026Fucking damnit. For things to twist and turn like this.\u2019</p><br/><p>Though they were leisurely fighting against the Farmers, they were feeling quite anxious.</p><br/><p>Even if they sided with Dakidus, there was no guarantee that he would let them live.</p><br/><p>The final state of Dakidus\u2019 body was a mess.</p><br/><p>His skin had been shredded apart by Hansoo and his attacks, the glossing fur had all been burnt off, bones were broken and muscles were destroyed.</p><br/><p>If they were in Dakidus\u2019 shoes?</p><br/><p>And if the things he usually treated as bugs were the ones who attacked him?</p><br/><p>He would not let them go.</p><br/><p>Though he would forgive them for now, it would eternally be in his memories.</p><br/><p>The scene he saw today.</p><br/><p>And if this memory ticked his brain and made him feel discomfort?</p><br/><p>It wouldn\u2019t be weird for them to suddenly get dragged away and get killed while they are on the Green Road.</p><br/><p>The fact that in this already dangerous world, an accident caused by somebody else had made them facing great risks was the reason why they were so enraged.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is why\u2026 We have to be on the good side.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was now war.</p><br/><p>And there was no middle ground to this war.</p><br/><p>Everybody was their enemy if they weren\u2019t on their side.</p><br/><p>They had to choose one side.</p><br/><p>And they had been the winners until now.</p><br/><p>They would be winners this time as well.</p><br/><p>\u2018Dumbasses, surviving is the highest priority.\u2019</p><br/><p>They had struggled.</p><br/><p>For survival.</p><br/><p>Who cared if this was all a trick or a test existed.</p><br/><p>They just needed to win.</p><br/><p>And Dakidus needed to live for this.</p><br/><p>So this was why these guys cannot go attack Dakidus.</p><br/><p>Karhal grinded his teeth as he attacked a Hunter in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastards! Fuck off!\u201d</p><br/><p>Dakidus had lost his strength.</p><br/><p>But humans were fighting with each other instead.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m slowly feeling shittier\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Karhal thought of a memory from the past.</p><br/><p>When he had first come up here.</p><br/><p>When he had been attacked by the hunting dogs that those guys had set up for fun.</p><br/><p>Karhal couldn\u2019t handle the tremendous amount of mana supplied by the blue jade and had to run away.</p><br/><p>While watching his sibling, whom he had spend a tremendous effort in finding and was treating very well, get transmitted by the blue light.</p><br/><p>If those things had come out from the beginning and had swept them apart then he wouldn\u2019t have been angry anyway.</p><br/><p>But they had instead played around with them with their superior strength.</p><br/><p>Making the humans fight with each other and watching that scene.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damned bastards. I cannot miss this opportunity no matter what.\u2019</p><br/><p>The time for revenge had finally come.</p><br/><p>Karhal then thought of Hansoo.</p><br/><p>He still couldn\u2019t understand quite a lot about him.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know what Hansoo was thinking about.</p><br/><p>But one thing was clear.</p><br/><p>That there aren\u2019t many people who did things that didn\u2019t make sense.</p><br/><p>He needed to follow those who did things that didn\u2019t make sense.</p><br/><p>People whose actions did not make sense at all in this damned world where saving one\u2019s own life and raising their strength was of utmost importance.</p><br/><p>This was why he had helped Ekidu and was why he was helping Hansoo now.</p><br/><p>Karhal and the others who had decided to go against Dakidus were having similar thoughts as they fought.</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t fighting just from high spirits and belief in Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026At this rate, we\u2019ll get killed even if we go up.\u2019</p><br/><p>From the previous event, the balance that had controlled the village had been smashed apart.</p><br/><p>They had despised Hansoo at first but the words of Dakidus had helped them resolute their minds.</p><br/><p>The rules set up for the Higher Races and the traitors of mankind deserved to be destroyed.</p><br/><p>\u2018The ones who are blocking the destruction of this are the same kind.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cKill them! These bastards!\u201d</p><br/><p>If they couldn\u2019t see any hope it might\u2019ve been different but as Dakidus had almost been killed, the ones appearing in front of them to block their path had enraged them greatly.</p><br/><p>But the moment the enraged Karhal was about to smash the hunter in front of him.</p><br/><p>Booooooooooom!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>From the distance.</p><br/><p>A pillar of light exploded out from where Hansoo and Dakidus had been fighting.</p><br/><p>A blue, holy pillar of light.</p><br/><p>And the moment the saw it.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh no\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Karhal and the others fell into despair.</p><br/><p>Since that pillar of light, which came down from the Atillan, only meant one thing.</p><br/><p>The guard who was attacking Karhal laughed out loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cUaahahahaha! See!? What could that guy do! You guys are now all dead!\u201d</p><br/><p>But at that moment.</p><br/><p>Roooooaaaaarrr!</p><br/><p>A pain filled roar rang throughout the entire vicinity.</p><br/><p>So loud that everyone could hear clearly.</p><br/><p>\u201cRoooooaaaar! Get a hostage! A hostage!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone made confused expressions at the pain-filled screams of Dakidus.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeheheh\u2026.Did you really think that things would go your way?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dakidus laughed weakly towards Hansoo even whilst gasping for air.</p><br/><p>And there was a huge hole on the belly of Dakidus.</p><br/><p>A single strike.</p><br/><p>His right arm had been blown apart by Hansoo, who had regained his mana, and a hole had been created in his belly.</p><br/><p>But Dakidus had been able to barely avoid getting hit in the vital parts because Hansoo\u2019s condition wasn\u2019t at its peak.</p><br/><p>Since the body wouldn\u2019t magically regenerate instantly even if one\u2019s mana came back.</p><br/><p>If Hansoo was in peak condition then he would\u2019ve definitely died from the previous attack.</p><br/><p>Since Hansoo\u2019s body was overflowing with a tremendous about of mana.</p><br/><p>\u2018But\u2026It\u2019s too late.\u2019</p><br/><p>Since Dakidus, whose body was numerous times stronger than Hansoo\u2019s, still knew about the situations of the villagers in the distance even without mana.</p><br/><p>\u2018Since they have chosen to follow me\u2026they should know what to do.\u2019</p><br/><p>And as he expected.</p><br/><p>They instantly realized the situation and started to follow his orders.</p><br/><p>The other side had a lot more in number but the ones following Dakidus had higher individual strength.</p><br/><p>They instantly figured out the situation and followed Dakidus\u2019s orders by suppressing the others one by one and grouping up.</p><br/><p>\u2018Good. Good.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cHeheh. What are you going to do now? Are you going to throw them all away? What about the ones caught as hostages? No, the hostages might not matter but are you even going to kill all those who follow me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dakidus blocked the slowly regenerating hole in his belly and started to laugh as if he had gained some leisure.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose guys are those who would\u2019ve gotten to the next stage without any problems without you. But because of your deeds they have chosen such extreme measures. They are just struggling to survive but\u2026Are you going to kill them all? Just because they didn\u2019t side with you? Hahaha! Ekidu is much better than this! What a tyrant!\u201d</p><br/><p>If the hostages were important then Hansoo wouldn\u2019t be able to kill him.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo didn\u2019t really react to Dakidus\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t get angry or feel flustered.</p><br/><p>Since there was no reason to.</p><br/><p>Hansoo spoke towards Dakidus without any expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you playing around or something?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo wouldn\u2019t kill them if they had stayed in the middle grounds at least.</p><br/><p>Since Hansoo also agreed with Dakidus\u2019s words to some extent.</p><br/><p>Since struggling to survive wasn\u2019t wrong.</p><br/><p>Even he had struggled and fought against others in order to survive and beat his competitors in the Yellow Zone back in the past.</p><br/><p>If he didn\u2019t have his trait, which started to show its might from around the Yellow Zone, he would\u2019ve definitely died.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo didn\u2019t have the leisure to care about everyone over there.</p><br/><p>Since it would be war from now on.</p><br/><p>\u2018I have to pick them out. Those who I will go with and those who I won\u2019t go with.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo understood Clementine\u2019s opinions to an extent.</p><br/><p>People that can\u2019t be trusted will only hold him down.</p><br/><p>There was a reason why the Emperors of the past purged dangerous generals and lieges as well as killing off traitors.</p><br/><p>The stronger they were, the more dangerous they were.</p><br/><p>Letting everyone in was like bringing up a bomb onto the boat.</p><br/><p>If Hansoo had some leisure and could guarantee his win at any given moment then he would\u2019ve definitely persuaded everyone there to take them.</p><br/><p>Since just letting them die in such a situation is a waste of their lives.</p><br/><p>But he wasn\u2019t fighting with a complete assurance and confidence that he would be able to win.</p><br/><p>The reason for him killing Dakidus and starting the fight against the Higher Races was not because he could win.</p><br/><p>He did it because he had to.</p><br/><p>Him coming to the past was not because he always had the confidence to twist every event and win at every situation.</p><br/><p>The thing he had brought back was just a possibility.</p><br/><p>Even with the knowledge of the future, not everything was solved.</p><br/><p>Since even the Alchemists were worried while setting up the plan.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t know what Hansoo would gain.</p><br/><p>He might be able to get something even better and he might not even be able to gain anything.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t know who will come into the plan and what kind of change would occur.</p><br/><p>Of course there wasn\u2019t any guaranteed plan.</p><br/><p>Set up the best suited plan for every situation with the knowledge of the future as the base.</p><br/><p>It was like dangerous tightroping.</p><br/><p>Since the enemy was that powerful.</p><br/><p>Even if the situation was dire for others, he couldn\u2019t allow this.</p><br/><p>This was just the start and more extreme situations would continue to occur.</p><br/><p>Crossroads would continue to appear.</p><br/><p>What Hansoo needed right now was people who could follow him even in a situation like this.</p><br/><p>\u2018Choice is free but you should take responsibility.\u2019</p><br/><p>He might win and the ones who followed him might face glory.</p><br/><p>But on the other hand, the ones who chose Dakidus and the Higher races might win and laugh instead.</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t in the wrong.</p><br/><p>This was war and the ones who died in war didn\u2019t die because they were in the wrong.</p><br/><p>It was just the one who they chose to side with, in this case Dakidus, had lost.</p><br/><p>That was it.</p><br/><p>Hansoo clenched onto the Forked Lightning in his hands and looked at Dakidus.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t throw all the blame onto me. Do you even know the amount who have died because of you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The casualties caused by Clementine and the Higher Races amount to tens of millions.</p><br/><p>If he didn\u2019t smash apart the current situation and destroy them, the amount of people who would come up to get sacrificed would be needed to counted by the hundreds of millions.</p><br/><p>This was why he was going to do his best.</p><br/><p>In order to destroy them.</p><br/><p>Along with everyone who sides with them.</p><br/><p>Everyone was clearly identified from Hansoo\u2019s enhanced perceptions.</p><br/><p>Those who would side with him and those who would go against him.</p><br/><p>\u2018The test ends now.\u2019</p><br/><p>In an instant.</p><br/><p>Rummblee~</p><br/><p>The mana that had been rotating around Hansoo\u2019s body roared as it all started to get sucked in somewhere.</p><br/><p>Towards his skill, the Pandemic blade.</p><br/><p>Rumblee</p><br/><p>The spores of the Pandemic blade greedily devoured the mana and started to increase in size.</p><br/><p>As if they were trying their best to mimic the scene they had caused in order to bring ruin to an entire world.</p><br/><p>To the point of even making the Demonic Dragon\u2019s Reinforcement disappear.</p><br/><p>At this time Hansoo\u2019s trait activated.</p><br/><p>Seven Stars.</p><br/><p>The spores who had been supplied with mana to the brim started to change and get reconstructed from Hansoo\u2019s trait.</p><br/><p>More powerful.</p><br/><p>More vicious.</p><br/><p>Whooosh</p><br/><p>The yellow spores around Hansoo\u2019s body twisted and turned as even their color changed.</p><br/><p>To a bloody red color.</p><br/><p>And soon.</p><br/><p>Booooom!</p><br/><p>The bloody storm which had exploded out with Hansoo as the center started to rush towards where the villagers were in the distance.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It\u2019s just a virtual reality game. There could be side effects like this.\u2019</p><br/><p>Himura chuckled.</p><br/><p>Since the others would figure it out if they killed everyone, they needed to handle the ratio.</p><br/><p>At a rate where they could still hunt and grow.</p><br/><p>And make it so nobody else knew about the deal.</p><br/><p>Since it would become troublesome if others found out about it.</p><br/><p>A few of the people from the Ant Tunnel would roam around as Watchmen and the Azure or Gold Demons would \u2018luckily\u2019 find them and kill them.</p><br/><p>Himura thought up to this point and added something extra.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>Kamiyou\u2019s expression froze as he thought of what happened 3 years ago.</p><br/><p>About 10% a year.</p><br/><p>The amount they stayed here for was about 3 years.</p><br/><p>Though 30% would die during the 3 years, the remaining 70% would grow and leave safely.</p><br/><p>This is why he had decided to take over this place.</p><br/><p>But from the way they were chasing him, it didn\u2019t seem like it\u2019d end that simply.</p><br/><p>Kamiyou asked Olsen.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou. What are you doing? Me and\u2026 Himura\u2026\u201dOlsen chuckled.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. You had a contract? Well. You did.\u201d\u201c...But?\u201dKamiyou\u2019s expression turned gloomy.</p><br/><p>Even to Himura, this would be like killing the goose which laid golden eggs.</p><br/><p>Since 10% was a huge number over 10 years and it was more than good in terms of stability.</p><br/><p>Olsen shrugged.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. How could I know what the uppers up decided?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kamiyou\u2019s expression froze as he saw Olsen\u2019s attitude.</p><br/><p>\u2018No can do.\u2019</p><br/><p>He was afraid of the possibility but it seemed these guys really were trying to kill all the adventurers.</p><br/><p>Kamiyou took out his final card.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it okay for all the money you guys spent on me to just disappear?\u201dBack then.</p><br/><p>Kamiyou denied the deal at first.</p><br/><p>10% surviving was just a deal of words, if Himura wanted then everyone inside the Ant Tunnel would get massacred.</p><br/><p>So Kamiyou had gotten angry and put out another deal.</p><br/><p>There was one thing he wanted.</p><br/><p>It was that the large amount money for managing the clan that was invested in the owner of the War Fortress, Keil Kingdom, would be under his name.</p><br/><p>It was so that if he didn\u2019t agree, they wouldn\u2019t be able to get the money back.</p><br/><p>And surprisingly, Himura easily accepted the deal.</p><br/><p>Even if he did agree with the deal, it was clear who had the upper hand anyway.</p><br/><p>Kamiyou clenched his teeth while thinking of Einchel.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Sorry. There was no such thing as the prophecy.\u2019</p><br/><p>How would he be able to deal with these vicious guys with just some words from a Prophet?</p><br/><p>He had lied to her because she wouldn\u2019t have left if he didn\u2019t say this much and because this was something he didn\u2019t want anyone else to know.</p><br/><p>And this was the last resort he had.</p><br/><p>The contract.</p><br/><p>The only hand that he, a traitor amongst the adventurers, could use.</p><br/><p>The Kingdom was something even the Ant Eater clan could not deal with.</p><br/><p>Which meant that these guys wouldn\u2019t be able to deal with him that easily either.</p><br/><p>He had used the final hand he had put so much trust in but still made a fearful expression.</p><br/><p>Because Olsen\u2019s mouth started to curl up into a smile.</p><br/><p>\u2018No. Even the Anteater clan\u2026 Cannot ignore such a large amount of money.\u2019</p><br/><p>They needed him to get the money back.</p><br/><p>Kamiyou swallowed back the fear that was slowly crawling up from the dark depths of his mind and then spoke towards Olsen.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo back. We will resettle in the Great Maze. If there\u2019s not enough harvest\u2026 I\u2019ll try harder. If another person dies I will commit suicide\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI said you don\u2019t need to.\u201d</p><br/><p>Crunch.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhuuuk\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Kamiyou made an expression of disbelief as he saw the blade which cut through his body.</p><br/><p>Since this was not part of his expectations.</p><br/><p>\u201cFucking...You are willing to lose all that money\u2026\u201dOlsen smirked at Kamiyou\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>How could they give up such a large amount of money?</p><br/><p>It was not a trifling amount.</p><br/><p>The situation had just changed a bit.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha. How could you know what is going on around in the world since you\u2019re always hiding in the ground.\u201d</p><br/><p>Crunch.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Kamiyou groaned as he saw Olsen twist the short sword embedded in his body.</p><br/><p>Olsen spoke towards Kamiyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cThings will change from now on. You will hear from your friends.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiiiiiing!</p><br/><p>The moment Olsen was about to activate the skill of his gauntlet.</p><br/><p>Charrrrrrk!</p><br/><p>The air split apart as something popped out.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh\u2026?\u201dBut before Olsen could even reply.</p><br/><p>Whoosh!</p><br/><p>Somebody took Kamiyou who still had a dagger stuck in his belly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis rat\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Olsen realized the situation as he quickly activated Azure Land.</p><br/><p>Craaacckckckkk!</p><br/><p>The entire area, with the gauntlet as the center, started to freeze.</p><br/><p>Right before Kamiyou and the man were about to freeze.</p><br/><p>Whooosh.</p><br/><p>The man who had come out from void with the dark aura hugged Kamiyou and returned to the void.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Clang!</p><br/><p>The air in front of Olsen froze and a huge block of ice appeared.</p><br/><p>But there were no traces of the two within.</p><br/><p>Olsen gritted his teeth as he saw this but then quickly calmed down.</p><br/><p>Since running away wouldn\u2019t change anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll continue with our original plan. Chase.\u201d</p><br/><p>Soon.</p><br/><p>Papapapapak!</p><br/><p>The moment the Gold and Scarlet Demons were about to split up within the maze.</p><br/><p>A voice came out from the darkness behind them.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait. Let\u2019s go together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>A slightly tired-sounding voice.</p><br/><p>That wasn\u2019t the issue.</p><br/><p>Since the owner of the voice should not be here.</p><br/><p>Olsen was shocked at the unexpected voice and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201c...What\u2019s up captain? I said we\u2019ll deal with the things here. Why aren\u2019t you chasing the blacklisted guy and\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The expressions of the ten Scarlet Demons including Sharon Stiller turned gloomy.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaa\u2026.Haa.. Ugh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Abanoph, who had saved Kamiyou by using and ran off, groaned out while looking at his frozen right hand.</p><br/><p>Though he could move through space in an instant, it didn\u2019t make him invulnerable during that time.</p><br/><p>Kamiyou looked at Abanoph with a sad expression but then looked around after feeling a sudden chill.</p><br/><p>A tremendously large area that didn\u2019t fit the maze.</p><br/><p>And the thousands of mysterious crosses.</p><br/><p>\u2018This\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>As Kamiyou was shocked at the mysterious place.</p><br/><p>The adventurers who were gathered around the 10m-tall crosses looked towards Kamiyou.</p><br/><p>With complex emotions.</p><br/><p>And Einchel, who was at the very front with the skull, spoke to Kamiyou expressionlessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cFound it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The location of the seal which had suppressed the Ains for hundreds of years.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is the place the prophecy mentioned\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>As Kamiyou looked around in a daze.</p><br/><p>A voice was heard from the entrance of the place.</p><br/><p>\u201cWelcome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Already?\u2019</p><br/><p>Kamiyou made a shocked expression as he looked at Hansoo.</p><br/><p>Even if he followed the traces, it was too fast.</p><br/><p>Since their opponents weren\u2019t stupid.</p><br/><p>They should\u2019ve dispatched a force they thought was enough for Hansoo but he still arrived at this place at the same time as them.</p><br/><p>\u2018How the hell\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Kamiyou made a confused expression.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

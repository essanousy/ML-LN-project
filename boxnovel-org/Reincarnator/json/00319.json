Shall I help you?\u2019</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014kwadddddddk!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u201cAh...Ahh...AHHHHHH!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Dark King fell mid-dash, and started to scream as all his skills dispersed.</p><br/><p>\u2014ssssssh\u2014 </p><br/><p>Zeus grit his teeth as he looked at the Dark King rolling around the floor.</p><br/><p>\u2018F***\u2026 I thought as much, but still.\u2019</p><br/><p>Of course the person who\u2019d put on such a suppression method wouldn\u2019t allow any forms of retaliation.</p><br/><p>He\u2019d tried to convince the Dark King just in case, but it seemed it wasn\u2019t very useful.</p><br/><p>Well, the one in pain was the Dark King anyway, and not him.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is good, at least I created an opening.\u2019</p><br/><p>The slight opening that was caused by the finger flick.</p><br/><p>Normal adventurers wouldn\u2019t be able to notice and utilize this, but he could.</p><br/><p>A tiny, tiny opening.</p><br/><p>\u2014crackle!\u2014 </p><br/><p>His Silveril slid past the shield and charged towards Hansoo\u2019s right arm.</p><br/><p>\u2014crack!\u2014 </p><br/><p>A satisfying sound could be heard from his right shoulder, and Zeus smiled at this.</p><br/><p>\u2018This should be good enough.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014chzzzchchzchz!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The tremendous flow of current surged through the Silveril.</p><br/><p>Even though Hansoo was a transcendent, he was still a human.</p><br/><p>If his nerves burned up and his heart stopped, he would still die.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ll make you suffer a bit more.\u2019</p><br/><p>Zeus didn\u2019t focus on his heart, but rather on the nerves all over Hansoo\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>This would cause the pain to intensify several times more, and could even cause paralysis.</p><br/><p>But at that moment\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2018What the\u2026what is this?!\u2019</p><br/><p>The lightning that he had poured into the other party\u2019s body was no longer in his control.</p><br/><p>Instead it was moving according to Hansoo\u2019s will.</p><br/><p>\u2018What the fuck?... Is this a Spirit?\u2019</p><br/><p>He had heard many stories about Spirits before.</p><br/><p>But he had never heard of a Spirit that could suck out the energy of the opponent however one willed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn\u2026 no!\u2019</p><br/><p>In the opening that was created when he lost control over his lightning, Hansoo smashed his spear towards his body.</p><br/><p>Right above his heart.</p><br/><p>\u2014kuddduduk\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u201cKuhuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>They were too close to each other.</p><br/><p>The spear that penetrated through the lightning armor and his ribs continued to dig into his body.</p><br/><p>Right into his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuaaa\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeus breathed out; somehow he was still alive, but only just barely.</p><br/><p>\u2014zzchchczhzz\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo, who had been electrocuted, spoke with a cold expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cRelease this before things turn nastier.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Even he would die if his heart were penetrated.</p><br/><p>Zeus slowly nodded and sat on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018What is this bastard?\u2019</p><br/><p>Zeus frowned as he looked at the man who was rapidly healing in front of him.</p><br/><p>This man had been hit by an attack that could have easily burned any normal transcendent countless times over.</p><br/><p>Even if he had a Spirit, the body should not be able to heal back this quickly.</p><br/><p>The healing rate was so fast that it was visible to the eye, and his right shoulder was basically completed mended already.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026Is he a lizard or something?\u2019</p><br/><p>Zeus looked at the man that had defeated him.</p><br/><p>He\u2019d assumed that he was pushing that man back, but as he thought about it, that didn\u2019t seem to be the case.</p><br/><p>That man\u2019s expression hadn\u2019t changed a single time during the whole fight, and he still seemed to have many things hidden up his sleeves.</p><br/><p>Though the man had received a lot more injuries, it now seemed that this was just his style of fighting.</p><br/><p>Since even he would use his shield to fight if he had a cheat-like healing ability as this man\u2019s.</p><br/><p>\u2018And it even seems like he grew stronger during our fight\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Zeus shook his head.</p><br/><p>That wasn\u2019t the important part.</p><br/><p>\u2018What do I do now? The situation is really bad.\u2019</p><br/><p>At first, he\u2019d been really worried.</p><br/><p>Of being turned like the Dark King.</p><br/><p>But thankfully, the man had only suppressed his mana, and hadn\u2019t turned him like the Dark King.</p><br/><p>Well, the spear was placed right outside his heart too.</p><br/><p>\u2018Thankfully\u2026wait, why am I thankful\u2026?\u2019</p><br/><p>Zeus mocked himself for having such thoughts.</p><br/><p>Even if one dodged the worst case scenario, they would still be in deep shit.</p><br/><p>Like now.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>After almost healing up, the man stood and spoke to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, how many of you guys were out there again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeus pondered for a moment.</p><br/><p>\u2018How should I answer so it\u2019s in my favor?...\u2019</p><br/><p>A very short moment of thought.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo didn\u2019t miss this.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah...things kept inside don\u2019t really come out on their own, do they?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Gotta squeeze them out as always.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo smiled coldly as he started to gather a dark-red-colored energy in his hand.</p><br/><p>The sight immediately caused Zeus to panic.</p><br/><p>Since that was the same vicious energy currently inside the Dark King\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh! No!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s slightly different.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even before Zeus could react, the dark-red energy had penetrated into his body.</p><br/><p>But soon Zeus realized that it wasn\u2019t doing anything, and was now confused.</p><br/><p>\u2018Huh?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo continued to smile coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI need to use you. How will I be able to use you if I turn you into that thing over there? Don\u2019t worry. This is just\u2026 well, let\u2019s just say that if I die, you\u2019ll die, too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!? You crazy bastard!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeus flew into a rage.</p><br/><p>He\u2019d thought that he was already in one of the worst possible situations, but apparently that wasn\u2019t the case.</p><br/><p>And he knew that what the man had said was true.</p><br/><p>The dark-red energy squirming around his heart and his brain proved it.</p><br/><p>Hansoo laughed at Zeus.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about it? Have your thoughts changed since we\u2019re now in the same boat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF***ing hell\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeus sighed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Crazy bastard\u2026 I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s thinking, but I hope he lives a calm life\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are your goals? I need to know your goals to answer your question. I should at least know what you want since we\u2019re in the same boat, right?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded at these words.</p><br/><p>\u201cSimple. I need a lot of people like you. As many as possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo was planning to fish out every last one of them.</p><br/><p>And if this guy told him their locations, things would become even easier.</p><br/><p>And the moment Zeus heard this, he grit his teeth.</p><br/><p>\u2018F***, this one is going to be trouble.\u2019</p><br/><p>Out of the eleven out there, none of them were easy targets.</p><br/><p>He grit his teeth as he predicted a future of himself becoming a meat shield for this bastard.</p><br/><p>He would need to do his best in that case.</p><br/><p>Since his comrades, no, they were his enemies now, weren\u2019t easy to deal with.</p><br/><p>\u2018What the hell is this guy\u2019s identity?\u2019</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>Something flashed through his mind.</p><br/><p>The mumbles of the being that had given him and his allies their strength.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Their sizes are completely different. Were they the same person?\u2019</p><br/><p>But for some reason he felt suspicious.</p><br/><p>Someone who had appeared out of nowhere.</p><br/><p>A similar outfit.</p><br/><p>And the golden spear in his hand did not look simple.</p><br/><p>Zeus cautiously asked just in case.</p><br/><p>\u201c...Are you perhaps that Kang Hansoo?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo didn\u2019t reply to his question, but Zeus knew.</p><br/><p>That he was Kang Hansoo.</p><br/><p>And the moment he realized this\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2018F***ing hell\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>The one who had turned him into a transcendent seemed to be half crazy, but one thing was clear.</p><br/><p>They felt an Intense amount of rage towards Hansoo.</p><br/><p>And he was sure that the being had ways of finding out if Hansoo had come back or not.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>Zeus\u2019s eyes turned to the War Fortress.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Was that the reason why he put the Dark King around this area?\u2019</p><br/><p>Zeus grit his teeth.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>The normal adventurers in the War Fortress were gossiping amongst themselves.</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t handle this intense feeling of unease.</p><br/><p>\u201cF***...What exploded this time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...Why are those guys not climbing up if they\u2019re that strong already? Why are they causing chaos around this area?\u201d</p><br/><p>They thought that everything would end after the Dark King had finally been dealt with, but something else had occurred just a few days after.</p><br/><p>Though they were quite a long distance apart from the battle, the shockwaves from the thunderstorm could be felt in their area.</p><br/><p>Though the man had won again, there were no guarantees that the man would continue to win.</p><br/><p>Of course they couldn\u2019t bear this constant lingering sense of danger.</p><br/><p>One of the people asked Akran.</p><br/><p>\u201c...Can\u2019t we just go up or something? Damn it all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Akran scoffed.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes anything change if we go up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...\u201d</p><br/><p>The man fell into silence.</p><br/><p>It was true.</p><br/><p>No matter where you go, if you yourself weren\u2019t strong, nothing would change.</p><br/><p>Akran spoke to the man who had fallen silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a chance for us to raise our strength, remember? That man is not our enemy.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man turned around with a grim expression.</p><br/><p>\u2018Though he\u2019s not a enemy\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>That man was not like the Dark King.</p><br/><p>He had given them a chance to become stronger.</p><br/><p>But that didn\u2019t help his fears from going away.</p><br/><p>\u2018...That man is actually more fearsome.\u2019</p><br/><p>Though the transcendents, who they could not handle, were terrifying.</p><br/><p>That man was even more so, since he was hunting those very transcendents.</p><br/><p>Any power that wasn\u2019t under one\u2019s control was a symbol of fear.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>Somebody approached Akran and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh...I think you\u2019ll need to come over for a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><br/><p>The adventurer spoke carefully.</p><br/><p>\u201c...One of the captured underlings of the Dark King escaped.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? How?\u201d</p><br/><p>Akran frowned.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

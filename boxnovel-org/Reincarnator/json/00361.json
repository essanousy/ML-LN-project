They might crawl out from inside those corpses too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kyaaaak! </p><br/><p>And R-Libera Nell fired at an insect that had just crawled out from a woman\u2019s corpse.</p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u201cLook! They might ambush us from behind, so dealing with the roots like this is important.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...\u201d</p><br/><p>R-Zairon Nell shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u2018Imbeciles, they never listen.\u2019</p><br/><p>They were royals of the royals from the three families.</p><br/><p>They had gained approval for their abilities and had reached the level of a Dragon God Soldier.</p><br/><p>They were born with a silver spoon in their mouths, and they had killed and massacred in place of learning manners.</p><br/><p>Actually, it would be weird if their personalities were normal.</p><br/><p>He had only become their leader because he\u2019d fought longer and was a bit stronger, so he wasn\u2019t someone who could fully control these guys.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fine. Fine, let\u2019s just do it your way.\u2019</p><br/><p>R-Zairon Nell decided just to let loose.</p><br/><p>He was a bit disgusted as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhuk\u2026 ugh.\u201d</p><br/><p>R-Zairon Nell wore a disgusted expression as he looked at the crawling alien woman.</p><br/><p>Well, at the woman\u2019s destination.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Disgusting.\u2019</p><br/><p>In the center of the sector was a giant container.</p><br/><p>And below it, there seemed to be a mechanism that looked like it was meant to feed them.</p><br/><p>The mechanism seemed to constantly drop something to the container at the bottom.</p><br/><p>A mysterious-looking feed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhh\u2026ah\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The infected women were continuously shoveling food into their mouths.</p><br/><p>As if they were never satisfied.</p><br/><p>It was not something that someone would do when they had a giant hole in their stomach which insects kept crawling out from.</p><br/><p>A strange sight indeed.</p><br/><p>A panel appeared before R-Zairon Nell\u2019s eyes, and he found out the feed\u2019s ingredients.</p><br/><p>\u2014tiriririk\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2018T-HTD and Hydrogen. Growth accelerator\u2026 A weakening agent and anesthesia.\u2019</p><br/><p>Until now, he had thought the women were acting crazy because of those strange creatures inside their stomachs.</p><br/><p>But apparently, he was wrong.</p><br/><p>The chemicals within that feed were messing with the minds of the women.</p><br/><p>So they wouldn\u2019t be able to feel the hole in their stomachs and would only focus on eating.</p><br/><p>And he realized why the feed was packed full of nutrients and growth accelerators.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s not to fatten up the women\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Kyaaaa! </p><br/><p>Insects continued to crawl out from inside the woman's\u2019 stomach.</p><br/><p>Cells were dividing at hundreds of times their normal speed inside the woman\u2019s stomach.</p><br/><p>And as they supported this growth, the alien woman continued to shovel the feed into her mouth to compensate this loss of energy and nutrients.</p><br/><p>As if she would die if she stopped.</p><br/><p>\u2014chomp! chomp! chomp! \u2014 </p><br/><p>The powerless bodies continued to feed themselves as they supported the birth of the strange monsters.</p><br/><p>R-Zairon Nell frowned at seeing their numbers continue to multiply, and he aimed with his Dragon God Armor.</p><br/><p>\u2014boooooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>A huge sound occurred as it destroyed the pen containing the women.</p><br/><p>\u201cWoah, captain. You just told us not to waste our energy just a second ago, hehe.\u201d</p><br/><p>R-Zairon Nell frowned at R-Libera Nell\u2019s snickering and then warned the others.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m just making a path for us. We\u2026 we might need to fall back. If these things have multiplied then this might become troublesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>A few of the Dragon God Soldiers asked in shock:</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Captain, are you insane? Aren\u2019t you going to listen to the fleet commander?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Securing an escape path? Is he saying we might need to run away?\u2019</p><br/><p>The commander had told them that they needed to breach the center and figure out what Melchizedek was hiding.</p><br/><p>Although they, the Dragon God Soldiers, were at an extremely high position in the Neropa Union, the fleet commander, R-Korinaita Nell, was different.</p><br/><p>That man was a level above themselves, who were already at the peak of the ladder.</p><br/><p>Although they were a bit arrogant, they were still a part of Neropa\u2019s military.</p><br/><p>If they went against military laws and didn\u2019t follow the orders of the fleet commander, then they would get in trouble.</p><br/><p>And R-Zairon Nell shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u2018Retards.\u2019</p><br/><p>Born as geniuses and accepted by the Dragon God Armor, and yet their visions were still too limited.</p><br/><p>Although a soldier should focus more on their duties today rather than surviving until tomorrow, they should still care about their own lives.</p><br/><p>\u2014kacha!\u2014 </p><br/><p>R-Zairon Nell crushed one of the bugs beneath his feet and picked it up with his hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook. Look at these things.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Dragon God Soldiers freaked out as he brought half of the insect closer to them while it spewed out a green liquid.</p><br/><p>Some even stepped backward.</p><br/><p>But looking at the serious Zairon holding up the insect, they approached him again and inspected it.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ugh\u2026 Why is he telling us to look at it? It looks weak. We can just sweep past it.\u2019</p><br/><p>Although the process of birth was disgusting, it was just some random insect.</p><br/><p>Couldn\u2019t they just massacre them all on the way there?</p><br/><p>Its body was made up of three parts and had eight legs.</p><br/><p>Sharp legs made to cut meat, with extremely powerful muscles for an insect.</p><br/><p>But that wasn\u2019t all.</p><br/><p>\u2014didididik\u2014 </p><br/><p>Information continued to display on R-Libera Nell\u2019s panel, one after another.</p><br/><p>&lt;...Metamorphosis under way.&gt;</p><br/><p>Something was constantly squirming inside their hard exoskeletons as its body continued to change.</p><br/><p>Their outer shells kept shedding off as it made new shells underneath.</p><br/><p>And the Dragon God Soldier\u2019s expression froze at this sight.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble!\u2014 </p><br/><p>A bright light exploded outwards, and lightning smashed down onto the ground.</p><br/><p>Unlike the Dragon God Soldiers, who were creating escape routes while slowly advancing\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014Hansoo merely continued to charge deeper and deeper like a madman.</p><br/><p>\u2014boom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Even if he blew off their heads, the infected would continue to move.</p><br/><p>To continue to breed the Abyssal race, .</p><br/><p>Only after burning both the outer and inside forms of the infected to a crisp could one stop their movements.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh..\u201d</p><br/><p>Even as she fell, the woman continued to push the coming out of their stomachs to Hansoo.</p><br/><p>Their actions weren\u2019t an attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh...Ah...\u201d</p><br/><p>Kyaaak! </p><br/><p>Hansoo glanced at the woman holding the insect gnawing on her hands.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just because of the drugs.</p><br/><p>These women seriously thought that these insects were their children.</p><br/><p>The Quirae had already infected their brains.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease\u2026 this child\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded and received the Quirae, staring at the woman handing over the insect even while her own body burned up.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked at the brightening expression of the woman after he\u2019d received the Quirae, and he thought:</p><br/><p>\u2018...Rest in peace.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014boom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The woman\u2019s head was gone.</p><br/><p>Hansoo stared at the fallen woman and then clenched his right hand.</p><br/><p>Kyaaak! </p><br/><p>After blowing up the Quirae in his hand, Hansoo clenched his hammer tightly.</p><br/><p>\u2018You really have gone too far.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo gazed towards the distant center of the giant city, towards the one who had caused all this.</p><br/><p>There was something he didn\u2019t understand.</p><br/><p>\u2018...He doesn\u2019t even control them.\u2019</p><br/><p>Melchizedek had only focused on raising them. It didn\u2019t look like it had any thoughts of controlling them.</p><br/><p>It would be a tremendous force if it could control the Quirae.</p><br/><p>No.</p><br/><p>The , if raised properly, could be among the most powerful races even within the Abyss.</p><br/><p>\u2014boooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2018They would be useful\u2026 so where is Melchizedek planning to use them?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo created a hole in the wall, looking at the scene beyond it.</p><br/><p>Kyaaak! </p><br/><p>Unlike the insects from before, these things had a different appearance.</p><br/><p>Maybe they had grown up, but these things looked half-human and half-insect.</p><br/><p>Hansoo charged towards them.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>R-Zairon Nell continued to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is just a newborn. The issue is, we don\u2019t know how far they can grow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese things could be crawling in that place, isn\u2019t it better to be reprimanded under military law instead of becoming some insect\u2019s meal inside this place?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...\u201d</p><br/><p>The Dragon God Soldiers nodded to themselves.</p><br/><p>\u2014boooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014boom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>They started to fire their weapons in every direction.</p><br/><p>To not leave behind a single trace.</p><br/><p>Kyaaaak!</p><br/><p>Ahhhh!</p><br/><p>The screams of the insects and the aliens filled up the surrounding space.</p><br/><p>Some of the Dragon God Soldiers frowned as they heard this.</p><br/><p>The Dragon God Soldier continued to fire their attacks.</p><br/><p>If they let these things survive\u2026</p><br/><p>The place they were standing in might end up swarming with these insects by the time they escaped.</p><br/><p>If they were running away, it meant the situation was already in a horrible state.</p><br/><p>If their escape path ended up blocked then it would make things even worse.</p><br/><p>\u2014chiiiiik\u2014 </p><br/><p>R-Zairon glanced at their surroundings, which had turned to dust, and said:</p><br/><p>\u201cProceed to the next sector.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Anyway, what is this crystal?

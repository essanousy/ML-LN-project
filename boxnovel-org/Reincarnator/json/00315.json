Forever.\u201d</p><br/><p>Until he released him.</p><br/><p>Or until he died.</p><br/><p>He would not be able to stop this act.</p><br/><p>Since the moment he stopped, the pain that was many times worse than being tortured in hell and all of eternity would rise up again.</p><br/><p>His entire life would now be devoted to that.</p><br/><p>His nose will smell the Abyss.</p><br/><p>And his eyes will look for their traces.</p><br/><p>His hands will smash their hearts, and his legs will constantly be forced to move to find them.</p><br/><p>And as the Dark King flew, the Abyssal beasts were smashed apart.</p><br/><p>Gulp.</p><br/><p>As he stared at the crystals that were littered on the ground, Taesang asked Hansoo\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u201cUh...What if he absorbs those crystals? Couldn\u2019t he overpower this pain once he gets stronger?\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know what Hansoo had done, but there was an unspoken rule in the Abyss.</p><br/><p>A skill set by a weaker party would not have much effect.</p><br/><p>Though he was like this for now, things might change if the Dark King actually grew stronger.</p><br/><p>Those bindings might break.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo just chuckled.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...Pardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI made it so he wouldn\u2019t be able to.

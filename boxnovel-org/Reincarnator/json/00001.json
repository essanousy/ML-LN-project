Do we need to have a popularity vote?\u201d</p><br/><p>Keldian, one of the four people who were standing in front of the crystal and who had a golden book, muttered while looking around the crystal.</p><br/><p>A great tool that is said to have the mythical power of sending one to the past.</p><br/><p>And the last remaining hope of the humankind which entered the Abyss 50 years ago and perished.</p><br/><p>A man in the corner with a massive sword spoke out at those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going. The strongest person should go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Keldian laughed at those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cKangtae, you\u2019ve just been lucky and gotten strong by stuffing runes and items. It\u2019ll be much better if I go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKeldian, I acknowledge your intellect but there were numerous occasions of disagreements when you clowned around with it. I shall go instead.\u201d</p><br/><p>Keldian stared at Eres and then laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cEres, you\u2019re too naive. Thinking of the troubles underneath you, you disqualify as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>The three who were arguing stopped and stared into the distance.</p><br/><p>Huge dragons that showed off their massive bodies were flying with incredible speed.</p><br/><p>The temple in which the crystal resided and the woman who saw the real owners of the crystals, Eres, spoke out with a bittersweet face.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like it isn\u2019t the time to argue.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fact that the dragons were flying here means that the forces they used to buy time have all been annihilated.</p><br/><p>If those had died, these 4 were the last of mankind.</p><br/><p>The golden dragon race was one of the top ruling classes even in the Abyss.</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t opponents for the dragons as they struggled just to get this far.</p><br/><p>Eres sighed with a regrettable face and spoke while looking at the man with a black hair sitting in the corner.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough it feels a little unfair there\u2019s no other way. Hansoo, you go. Everyone agrees?\u201d</p><br/><p>At those words Kangtae and Keldian held a reluctant face then sighed as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan I really not go? I have confidence I can do well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Don\u2019t look at me like that. Petty ones.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kangtae complained with an extremely pitiful face.</p><br/><p>Then Hansoo sighed with a tired look.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t I stop fighting now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo shook his head.</p><br/><p>50 years since the great war between the original races who had been dragged into the Abyss.</p><br/><p>The survivors had to fight rigorously every day for 50 years.</p><br/><p>Just to survive.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve fought too long.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo shook his head.</p><br/><p>As if it\u2019s allright to die like this.</p><br/><p>But Eres\u2019 head shook with a firm look.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are the one who has to go.\u201d</p><br/><p>The four people here including herself arrived this far because they were the most outstanding of the 7 billion people.</p><br/><p>They had confidence to do better if they returned to the past and to do so they needed another chance.</p><br/><p>But everyone knew inside.</p><br/><p>\u2018He\u2019s the one who has to go.\u2019</p><br/><p>The ruler classes of abyss were so strong that even if they went back in time they didn\u2019t have a complete guarantee that they could win against them.</p><br/><p>However, he started 20 years after they did yet he stood shoulder to shoulder with them.</p><br/><p>If he had bloomed his unique potential a little earlier, no, 5 years earlier, then they wouldn\u2019t have been pushed back this far.</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked at the three and then spoke out.</p><br/><p>\u201cSay something, I should at least listen to the last words of my friends.\u201d</p><br/><p>If it was anybody else it wouldn\u2019t have mattered but how could he ignore their words.</p><br/><p>As Hansoo watched the three with a regrettable look, Kangtae spoke out first.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou. If you have the chance to acquire my runes and items, take them all and use them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Don\u2019t I give them to the you of the past?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo asked with a surprised face.</p><br/><p>His items and runes were immeasurable to the point that his nickname was fate creator.</p><br/><p>To the point where a huge problem between them occurred.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s better that you use them instead of me. If you\u2019re going to do something, do it right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded at those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cEres, what about you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fling off people who approach you just because it\u2019s annoying and take care of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will try.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh come on, you\u2019re going to save humanity aren\u2019t you? Think about how cool it is. Listen to the leader.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, if the situation allows it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh..\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo turned his back to the sighing Eres as he asked Keldian last:</p><br/><p>\u201cKeldian, what about you? Oh by the way I have no confidence in using my brain as well as you. I have no confidence in collecting all the skills you use either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Keldian replied with a cold face:</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have much. If you go back to the past\u2026 get rid of those \u2018cockroaches\u2019 who will only be of harm during the great war. And that Light Monarch, kill him for sure. That is my request.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded and Keldian smiled with a satisfied smile. Then he lifted up his book and started mumbling something.</p><br/><p>Then shining light bursted out of the crystal and surrounded Hansoo as he disappeared with the light.</p><br/><p>\u201cI should rest now.\u201d</p><br/><p>They wanted to go but they also wanted to rest.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t know their true feelings so they said no in case they regretted it.</p><br/><p>Since this chance is literally the last chance.</p><br/><p>However since it was decided and he was sent off, they clearly knew their true feelings.</p><br/><p>Since their minds were now at rest.</p><br/><p>At the same time they felt bad for Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake care. We leave it up to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The three watched the disappeared Hansoo as they smiled with a mix of regret and relief. Soon the energy blasted out by the golden dragons swept them from above like a storm.</p><br/><p>Ed\u2019s Note</p><br/><p>We\u2019ve just started (June 2016) building a Wikia.

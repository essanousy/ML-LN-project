The Nell family will watch over zones 114 to 272. The Pael family and Ron family should watch over their own respective areas.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other two leaders nodded.</p><br/><p>Although it was sudden, they all had the same goal.</p><br/><p>After all, those stupid monsters couldn\u2019t seem to discern between the sides.</p><br/><p>This might actually be a good chance.</p><br/><p>Dealing with the giant opponent they\u2019d been fighting against all this time and acquiring the chance to take over this entire planet.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, we three will probably fight amongst ourselves after that, but\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>K-Ukatan Pael nodded and asked:</p><br/><p>K-Adelaia Ron looked at the screen K-Ukatan Pael had pointed to, observing the monsters devouring the energy from the Great Furnace. She then replied:</p><br/><p>\u201cYou two just need to agree. Using the relic during a most dangerous time\u2026 Do you two agree?\u201d</p><br/><p>K-Ukatan Pael\u2019s and K-Merrow Nell\u2019s expressions stiffened up at this talk of the relic, but they soon loosened up.</p><br/><p>They nodded.</p><br/><p>They both knew that the current situation was really dire.</p><br/><p>Even they themselves might need to head to the frontlines to aid them.</p><br/><p>Although they disliked the thought of having to act, but that bastard Pompeion might come as well.</p><br/><p>They needed to prepare themselves in order to defend against him at all times.</p><br/><p>Preparation against Pompeion directly entering the battle and destroying the ships on his own.</p><br/><p>\u2018That monster..\u2019</p><br/><p>As if all three had thought of Pompeion at the same time, all their expressions had stiffened up.</p><br/><p>K-Adelaia Ron quickly erased Pompeion from her mind and spoke towards the two other leaders before her.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, then it\u2019s settled. Let\u2019s focus on our own territory.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014tiririririk\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014K-Adelaia Ron received a message.</p><br/><p>\u2018I told them that I was in a meeting and that they shouldn\u2019t send any reports up\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>K-Adelaia Ron frowned and started to open up the message.</p><br/><p>But then\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014tiririirk\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014tiririk\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014the other two leaders received messages as well.</p><br/><p>\u2018...?\u2019</p><br/><p>K-Adelaia Ron was shocked at this scene.</p><br/><p>And K-Merrow Nell, who had an impatient personality and had read the message first, frowned as he spoke out.</p><br/><p>\u201c...?\u201d</p><br/><p>K-Adelaia Ron frowned as she quickly opened up the message she received.</p><br/><p>She felt like the three messages they\u2019d received separately had similar contents.</p><br/><p>Although they were thousands of kilometers away and it was unlikely that they would simultaneously receive a similar message, her intuition was telling her something else.</p><br/><p>And soon\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201c...Those bastards.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014K-Adelaia Ron\u2019s expression turned into that of rage.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u2014boooooom!\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014</p><br/><p>Cities blew apart alongside the sounds of explosions.</p><br/><p>\u201cWaaaahhh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell! Where\u2019s the army?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The citizens of the 14th City, Etoreim, ran away while roaring in rage.</p><br/><p>For N-Levels like them to receive such a lack of protection\u2026</p><br/><p>N-Zairon cursed as he continued to flee.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow dare they allow these trashy aliens to come all the way up here and cause a scene! Dammit!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014a man walked out from a nearby street with a frown.</p><br/><p>\u201cTrash?\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as those words ended\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014paaaaaak!\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cKuaaaaah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014N-Zairon, who had been kicked in the abdomen, felt as if his stomach had been ripped off as he started to roll on the ground.</p><br/><p>John Stone, the man who had walked out from the nearby street, spat at N-Zairon and mumbled:</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastard\u2026 I\u2019m really not in a good mood.\u201d</p><br/><p>But as he was about to crush the man\u2019s head with his feet\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014a woman who had followed John Stone from behind, stopped him and said:</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry and continue. If you want to kill each and every single person like him then all 423 days of the year wouldn\u2019t be enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...F***.\u2019</p><br/><p>John Stone swung the axe in his hand as if to vent out his anger.</p><br/><p>\u2014boooom!\u2014</p><br/><p>He looked in satisfaction at the building that had been cut into two as the woman continued to talk to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have no time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn\u2026 Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>The woman who was wearing the Dragon God Armor started to dash away as John Stone quickly followed after her.</p><br/><p>\u2014whoooosh!\u2014</p><br/><p>While dashing through the air at a very quick pace\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014John Stone continued to curse inwardly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Dammit! Dammit! Dammit!!!\u2019</p><br/><p>He should\u2019ve quickly run away and headed up.</p><br/><p>For him to have been forced into this war\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014</p><br/><p>He could feel the ships aiming towards his location.</p><br/><p>If the city\u2019s worth was much lower than their own expectations then those ships would\u2019ve long blown this place to pieces.</p><br/><p>Since those things were originally designed to cruise through space and destroy stars.</p><br/><p>Although he could deal with one or two ships, any more than that and even he\u2019d be forced to run.</p><br/><p>But it was too late.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damned bastard. Damned bastard. Damned bastard.\u2019</p><br/><p>As John Stone frowned at the red energy that was squirming around inside his body\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014the woman who was running alongside him pointed towards a structure.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need to break that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...God dammit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry.\u201d</p><br/><p>John Stone exhaled deeply and then tightly gripped his axe.</p><br/><p>\u2014kacha\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014booooooom!\u2014</p><br/><p>The reinforcement placed around the blade of his axe exploded out and slammed into the building the woman had pointed at.</p><br/><p>\u2014whoooosh!\u2014</p><br/><p>As if it was an important building, a few bright pillars appeared and covered the building with a bright shield but it didn\u2019t last long.</p><br/><p>\u2014clank!\u2014</p><br/><p>John Stone\u2019s attack smashed right through the shield with ease and started to cut the entire building into two.</p><br/><p>\u201cAahhhhhh! What the hell?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRun!\u201d</p><br/><p>A building that was easily hundreds of meters tall had been cut into two and had started to crumble as the people beneath it began to freak out and run away.</p><br/><p>Although they had set up defensive structures so that even a Dragon God Soldier could not get through this place.</p><br/><p>John Stone, who could even destroy entire ships, could easily break this place apart.</p><br/><p>Since this building had been designed to defend against Dragon God Soldiers who were similar to level 2-Star Transcendents, it could not defend against John Stone who was at the 3-Star Transcendent level.</p><br/><p>As John Stone looked at the crumbling building in satisfaction\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hurry and continue. Since we destroyed the communications tower, there should be a huge delay in their communications. We need to destroy as many important structures as we can while they fix it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014Metionell, a woman from the Kalkata tribe, pointed towards the other building as John Stone frowned.</p><br/><p>But he soon sighed and nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaa\u2026 Fine. Fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>He just wanted to watch his handiwork for a moment, but for her to speak out right away\u2026</p><br/><p>But her words weren\u2019t wrong at all.</p><br/><p>The faster they disarmed this city and left, the higher the chances of their survival.</p><br/><p>John Stone started to run with Metionell as a question appeared inside his mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyway, you know this city very well. Do you have a map or something similar?\u201d</p><br/><p>The city was extremely large and the buildings were all very similar to each other so it was basically a maze.</p><br/><p>But for her to be able to find the important structures this easily\u2026</p><br/><p>Metionell replied to John Stone:</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was originally the city of my tribe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...This was your land?\u201d</p><br/><p>Metionell nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why Kiriel moved us here.\u201d</p><br/><p>How could she forget?</p><br/><p>Her homeland which she had lived in for decades and had been driven away from.</p><br/><p>She had never forgotten it and had always thought about it.</p><br/><p>\u2018But now\u2026 We have to break it.\u2019</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t theirs anymore so there was no need to hold back either.</p><br/><p>At that moment\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014boooom!\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014boom!\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014a few beings appeared before John Stone and Metionell.</p><br/><p>\u2014chiiiiik\u2014</p><br/><p>Dragon God Soldiers clad in their armor.</p><br/><p>The person who had been standing at the very front spoke out in a cold voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re trying to do, Metionell.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014Metionell\u2019s eyelids shook.</p><br/><p>\u201c...Karass. You filthy traitor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Karass welcomed Metionell\u2019s disgusted expression as he tapped the Dragon God Armor surrounding his body and said:</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been able to wear this because of that betrayal, and I\u2019ve even been promoted. But for you to run away to that trash dump and now to join hands with the aliens\u2026 I don\u2019t know how far you can fall. Let me finish you off here today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>John Stone yawned while watching the two converse, thinking:</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s good to have a rest, but\u2026 why are they acting so confident?\u2019</p><br/><p>For them to be so confident in their Dragon God Armor.</p><br/><p>It was something he\u2019d fought against when he was a 2-Star Transcendent\u2014it was nothing more than scrap metal to him now.</p><br/><p>He could easily cut apart those beings with a single slash of his axe, and for them to act this confident\u2026</p><br/><p>Karass made a strange smile at John Stone\u2019s expression.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u2014rummmble!\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2018It seems like everyone is doing well\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo, who had been looking at Neoreim from the top of a skyscraper, turned to look behind him.</p><br/><p>And he saw seven people who were conversing behind him with excitement.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wish they choose us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019ll know soon enough when they take off their capes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The seven Dragon God Soldiers who had arrived beside them.</p><br/><p>Kiriel frowned at their conversation.</p><br/><p>\u2018There\u2019s no way that they\u2019re this stupid.\u2019</p><br/><p>There was no way they didn\u2019t know their level of strength since they\u2019d observed Hansoo and her from the sky all this time.</p><br/><p>They should know that the Dragon God Armor wasn\u2019t nearly enough to deal with the two of them.</p><br/><p>But then\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014boooom!\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014a tremendous aura exploded out from around the Dragon God Soldiers.</p><br/><p>And the Dragon God Soldier who had been standing at the very front spoke excitedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is your first time seeing the Flame\u2019s Blessing, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...Wait, I\u2019ve heard this line before.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Kiriel mumbled at the words of the Dragon God Soldiers\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014Hansoo looked at the red marks on their necks.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hmm\u2026 There\u2019s someone helping them out in using the relic.\u2019</p><br/><p>There was no time to be lazy anymore.</p><br/><p>Hansoo thought of the Nerpa and then felt the newly found seed near his heart.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

What is the contract you made in the past.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo choked Tiamet as he mumbled.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhuk\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tiamet gritted his teeth as he vomited out blood.</p><br/><p>Because he had erased the special characteristics of all the enhanced race from himself in order to resist the orders of the 1st grade citizens\u2026 The snowstorm around him was continously gnawing away at him.</p><br/><p>There was no way to defeat Hansoo anymore.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is the end huh\u2026.\u2019</p><br/><p>The first thing he thought of was that thing.</p><br/><p>The reason for his thousand years of hard work.</p><br/><p>\u2018Those things\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Tiamet chuckled as he thought of the fairies.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah\u2026 If you fused then you should\u2019ve seen a bit of the past through Mudusella\u2019s memory. Well you see, I\u2019ve only asked for a small thing but I don\u2019t know why things have become like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tiamet thought of the past.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The fairy-like existence from the past spoke to him.</p><br/><p>And told him that he had done more than enough to have the right to ask them for something.</p><br/><p>And Tiamet grinded his teeth at the fairy\u2019s suggestion.</p><br/><p>He had heard before.</p><br/><p>That none of the devil\u2019s deals were proper nor good.</p><br/><p>A one-sided trade designed for the enjoyment of the devil.</p><br/><p>The other party who trades with the devil will be driven into destruction.</p><br/><p>Tiamet smirked at himself who had accepted this offer.</p><br/><p>But he knew now.</p><br/><p>As to why all those stories told him to be wary of the devil\u2019s offer but why none of them refused it.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is it huh.\u2019</p><br/><p>Humans didn\u2019t trade with the devil because they were weak or evil.</p><br/><p>The devil was.</p><br/><p>This evil thing.</p><br/><p>It appeared right when the humans were at their weakest point in life.</p><br/><p>That point when the humans could not deny it.</p><br/><p>\u2018Kekeke.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tiamet realized as he looked at the fairy which was smiling in a vicious manner.</p><br/><p>That he himself was at the weakest point of his life.</p><br/><p>There was only one wish in his head.</p><br/><p>To acquire a space where he and Astania could live together.</p><br/><p>Destroying the 1st grade citizens or something.</p><br/><p>And as he wished.</p><br/><p>The fairy smirked.</p><br/><p>Nepallem smiled while nodding and then stretched his hand towards the tower.</p><br/><p>And soon.</p><br/><p>Booooooom!</p><br/><p>The giant tower went crazy and started to reverse the power that was pushing away the calamity that was covering the entire planet.</p><br/><p>The ashy clouds disappeared as sunlight landed on the land across the mountain range.</p><br/><p>Tiamet realized.</p><br/><p>That the giant Obelisk which Nepallem had made had the power to solve this calamity.</p><br/><p>Of course he didn\u2019t care whether the citizens died or not.</p><br/><p>But he couldn't help but feel disgusted at this man all of a sudden.</p><br/><p>Nepalem suddenly spoke.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>Astania\u2019s body disappeared into thin air.</p><br/><p>Towards the inner parts of the Obelisk.</p><br/><p>Nepalem approached Tiamet and lifted his hands towards the back of Tiamet\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>&lt;....!&gt;</p><br/><p>Tiamet instinctively tried to attack Nepalem and attacked him with the white beam.</p><br/><p>But it was futile.</p><br/><p>The white beam was deflected away and Nepallem\u2019s hand grasped onto the back of his neck.</p><br/><p>Like an adult holding down a kid.</p><br/><p>Everyone thought that Nepallem wasn\u2019t any stronger than a 1st grade citizen no matter how much of a genius he was.</p><br/><p>But for him to suppress Tiamet this easily.</p><br/><p>Nepalem used a strange energy and controlled the chipset.</p><br/><p>Booooom!</p><br/><p>White light started to explode out from Tiamet\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>The secret only the developer knew.</p><br/><p>Nepalem smiled as he removed the limiter.</p><br/><p>And Tiamet looked at his body in shock.</p><br/><p>Power was rushing throughout his body.</p><br/><p>Nepallem laughed towards Tiamet.</p><br/><p>&lt;...A hostage?&gt;</p><br/><p>Nepallem laughed.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>It was simple after this really.</p><br/><p>Though it was still a bit hard for him to go up against all of the 1st grade citizens and the enhanced race members but they were all spread out inside the ship.</p><br/><p>He just needed to smash them apart one by one.</p><br/><p>He killed all of the 1st grade citizens who had the power to control the enhanced race.</p><br/><p>And he had saved all of the 2nd grade citizens and the Ains.</p><br/><p>Since he knew it was impossible for him to do this all alone.</p><br/><p>Nepallem\u2019s condition was simple.</p><br/><p>Until he transcended and attained the power to escape this world with his Skill of Annihilation.</p><br/><p>So he had used the 2nd grade citizens and the Ains to create the White Dragon Arena.</p><br/><p>And had sealed the Ains who could become a variable.</p><br/><p>As the secrecy of this all was a requirement that the fairy added in into their deal.</p><br/><p>Tiamet asked back in confusion.</p><br/><p>All the 3rd grade citizens were asleep and the 2nd grade citizens and the Ains knew about the history already.</p><br/><p>The fairy responded.</p><br/><p>And he realized after close to a thousand years.</p><br/><p>Whom he needed to keep this a secret from.</p><br/><p>The tens of millions of people\u2019s information were inside the obelisk.</p><br/><p>Tiamet was shocked as he looked at the 3rd grade citizens who were reviving with erased memories with that information as the basis.</p><br/><p>He then realized.</p><br/><p>And he realized this was even more true as he saw these \u2018adventurers\u2019 getting hunted down by the 3rd grade citizens.</p><br/><p>He finally realized what being recycled meant.</p><br/><p>Tiamet had finally started to understand what the final words of Nepallem were.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018...I guess I failed hold up my end of the contract.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tiamet spoke to Hansoo with a defeated expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou wouldn't\u2019 allow me to live.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tiamet looked at Hansoo who wasn\u2019t responding and nodded.</p><br/><p>There was no reason for Hansoo to keep him alive.</p><br/><p>Since this was the only chance he had to kill him.</p><br/><p>And it was clear from what Hansoo was holding with his hand.</p><br/><p>Badump. Badump.</p><br/><p>The hand that had entered through his ribs and had grasped his heart.</p><br/><p>He had failed.</p><br/><p>He had failed to transcend and release Astania from being a hostage.</p><br/><p>\u2018I really worked hard for a thousand years.\u2019</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that bad.</p><br/><p>Since Astania would continue to live in this world.</p><br/><p>In immortality.</p><br/><p>\u2018Better than dying.\u2019</p><br/><p>He could just refuse to speak of the past but he did on purpose.</p><br/><p>Because\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be able to escape it either. Because you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As Tiamet smirked.</p><br/><p>Booooooom!</p><br/><p>In the distance.</p><br/><p>The giant spaceship in the outskirts of the city started to activate.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the\u2026 Why is this working?\u201d</p><br/><p>As one of the players made a shocked expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan we see outside if we turn it on? Try turning it on, I want to see what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...Mmm. Okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>As one of the players fumbled with the panel.</p><br/><p>One of them recorded the inner parts of the spaceship and broadcasted it.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, shall we see what\u2019s going on outside? Since this spaceship was falling across the mountain range\u2026 We will be able to see the scene behind it now right? This is being broadcasted for the first time.\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the Kalikul clansman laughed as he started the broadcast.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

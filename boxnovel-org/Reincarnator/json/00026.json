Go ahead first\u201d</p><br/><p>Gyucheol couldn\u2019t hold it in as he raged.</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you being too much young friend? And this isn\u2019t just my thoughts. We need to move together as nine but what do you want us to do if you enter a dangerous place like this\u201d</p><br/><p>Gyucheol\u2019s face was on fire as he spat out the words.</p><br/><p>Since he knew that it wasn\u2019t something he should be saying.</p><br/><p>But he held it in.</p><br/><p>The thing he had realized as he gained age and as he became a man of the family was that embarrassment was just for that moment and being loud was rather effective.</p><br/><p>Who would protect his family if he lets Hansoo go because of his ego and then die afterwards.</p><br/><p>His wife and his daughters could not even threaten a fish.</p><br/><p>They will probably die as soon as he dies.</p><br/><p>Or something even worse.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s better to get cursed at\u2019</p><br/><p>And there was still a problem if he beat the snake.</p><br/><p>Since it can only take a long time for him to fight the snake.</p><br/><p>Since then the destruction line that they had created a gap from would catch up them.</p><br/><p>And if that happened they had to fight more anxiously.</p><br/><p>\u2018You..as long as you come with us and fight then won\u2019t be any problem\u2019</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t they do good until now.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t a game, this wasn\u2019t the time to worry about killing a strong monster for items or runes but why was he going crazy just because he couldn\u2019t fight that powerful looking snake.</p><br/><p>They were already busy trying to push ahead.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn. It\u2019s not because he\u2019s young. He\u2019s just crazy\u2019.</p><br/><p>Hansoo clicking his tongue as he looked at that Gyucheol.</p><br/><p>There were times like this where they opinions crossed.</p><br/><p>And he understood as well.</p><br/><p>If a man wasn\u2019t selfish during times of danger then when would he be selfish.</p><br/><p>\u2018But there\u2019s no other way\u2019</p><br/><p>Since their goals were different there was no other way.</p><br/><p>Hansoo shook his head as he walked towards the snake.</p><br/><p>\u201cGoddamit! If you were going to act selfishly like that then why are you traveling with us in the first place!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo shrugged his shoulders at Gyucheol\u2019s words as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cI never traveled with you. The way we were going was the same\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026dammit\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment everybody realized that even though Hansoo had been fighting in the front, he had never traded anything with them.</p><br/><p>Though he had taught them a few things discreetly.</p><br/><p>Gyucheol, who couldn\u2019t hold it anymore, cursed out loud while his wife and daughter looked at Gyucheol with a pitiful expression and him took him away after looking at Hansoo with a resentful face.</p><br/><p>They knew that they were alive because of Hansoo but they were sad because of Hansoo acting the way he wanted.</p><br/><p>While they were leaving, somebody was watching Hansoo with a regrettable face.</p><br/><p>The one who actually stimulated Gyucheol was Hanchul.</p><br/><p>He was going to try recruiting him after watching for a little bit longer but he was shocked because Hansoo had said he was going to fight the snake.</p><br/><p>It did indeed seem like something amazing will come out if that snake was killed.</p><br/><p>But that was only important while they were alive.</p><br/><p>They had no thoughts of fighting with that anaconda-like 15m long snake.</p><br/><p>If Hansoo had miraculous powers to the point where he could slice it in half then they might\u2019ve followed him meticulously to gain a little bit of anything.</p><br/><p>But they had eyes too.</p><br/><p>The snake which was sliding between the trees was quite nimble despite its size and its size broke the branches that were as big as normal tree trunks which showed his strength.</p><br/><p>That was not something where they can gain anything out of while Hansoo was fighting it alone.</p><br/><p>And they wanted to get away as fast as possible because of these thoughts.</p><br/><p>Since it will be bad if they received collateral damage whilst watching Hansoo fight.</p><br/><p>They had no thoughts of getting dragged in.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well. There\u2019s nothing that can be done\u2019</p><br/><p>If somebody couldn\u2019t keep their lives in tact then that was all they were worth.</p><br/><p>The eight others quickly left Hansoo and took off as Hansoo bit onto a cloud snack while chucking at this view.</p><br/><p>Then he charged at the Rune Eater Snake.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Kudududk</p><br/><p>\u201cHoo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo took out the cloud snack he was biting on and then grasped the rune eater\u2019s snake with both hands.</p><br/><p>And behind him a giant rune eater snake was laid out dead with its brain pierced through.</p><br/><p>\u2018Now there\u2019s only five cloud snacks left\u2019</p><br/><p>Rune eater snake was indeed strong.</p><br/><p>But it was much weaker than the Carnivorous Beast.</p><br/><p>And his stats were much more different from then.</p><br/><p>He had used colorless energy and used the cloud snack because of limited time but only one was needed</p><br/><p>Kachak</p><br/><p>And soon the egg cracked open as a small snake that couldn\u2019t be imagined to be a baby of that giant snake came out and crawled above Hansoo\u2019s wrist.</p><br/><p>\u2018Good\u2019</p><br/><p>There were quite a bit of Strength, Stamina, Agility and Perception runes gathered on his wrist.</p><br/><p>These were stats that Hansoo judged to be not necessary for the moment.</p><br/><p>Hansoo started to feed the baby rune eater snake with all the runes he had gathered up.</p><br/><p>The rune eater snake didn\u2019t realize it\u2019s parent was dead as it greedily gulped down the runes on Hansoo\u2019s wrist.</p><br/><p>The four types of runes on his wrist quickly disappeared as a different type of rune replaced their spots.</p><br/><p>\u2018First, raise magic, physical and magic resistances.</p><br/><p>His Mana wasn\u2019t really lacking.</p><br/><p>He had in instead raise these other three stats in order to raise his ability battle powers which were lacking.</p><br/><p>Since soon things with abilities will pop out one by one.</p><br/><p>[Kang Hansoo]</p><br/><p>Strength(Colorless): 0.02%</p><br/><p>Stamina: 88.8</p><br/><p>Agility: 84.0</p><br/><p>Perception: 85.1</p><br/><p>Mana: 58.4</p><br/><p>Magic: 30</p><br/><p>Physical resistance: 25</p><br/><p>Magic resistance: 25.3</p><br/><p>\u2018Finally I\u2019ve gained the eight great stats\u2019</p><br/><p>The most basic and the stat that impacted the battle powers the most, the eight great stats.</p><br/><p>From now he had to keep raising these stats in balance.</p><br/><p>Keiiik!</p><br/><p>The rune eater snake which seemed to be content from eating its fill cried out in content as it fell asleep on his wrist</p><br/><p>It was indeed the offspring of that giant rune eater snake no matter how you looked at it.</p><br/><p>He wouldn\u2019t bat an eye during normal battles.</p><br/><p>\u2018You just stay asleep\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo, who had been looking at it cutely, started to walk fast as he saw the destruction line closing in.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDad. What do we do\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBe quiet please\u201d</p><br/><p>While Gyucheol and his Family were left behind on a fork on a road and were struggling, somebody started to appear afar.</p><br/><p>Gyucheol nodded after seeing this.</p><br/><p>\u2018I knew this would happen\u2019</p><br/><p>He was covered in blood but it was Hansoo.</p><br/><p>Gyucheol, who had been looking at Hansoo, spoke out.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you perhaps run while fighting?\u201d</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t seem like his strength, agility or stamina changed much from before.</p><br/><p>If the giant snake had given him runes then a his runes should have increased by a large amount.</p><br/><p>And the snake did indeed look stronger than Hansoo so the time that he took was too fast for killing it.</p><br/><p>Since the time it took for Hansoo to come back only took around the time it took to smoke one cigarette.</p><br/><p>\u201cI killed it\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Lies\u2019</p><br/><p>If he wasn\u2019t going to gain anything then why did he fight?</p><br/><p>No he did gain something.</p><br/><p>Only injuries all over the body.</p><br/><p>But it was to his expectations anyway.</p><br/><p>Since he guessed that he would at least run before he died.</p><br/><p>Hansoo asked the three as he asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe other people?\u201d</p><br/><p>The others excluding Gyucheol and the two could not be seen.</p><br/><p>Gyucheol grinded his teeth at those words.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026they went that way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018and leaving us behind\u2019</p><br/><p>He thought of Hancheol\u2019s words before he departed.</p><br/><p>\u2018That bitch\u2026 both this guy and him\u2019</p><br/><p>Gyucheol had to choose.</p><br/><p>Either to fight in the front.</p><br/><p>Or wait until Hansoo came back and then charge through the path with Hansoo in the front.</p><br/><p>But he had no confidence to fight in the front.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damnit\u2026 I should\u2019ve fought in the front from the beginning\u2019</p><br/><p>While the others were constantly fighting, he had been left behind without being able to eat any runes.</p><br/><p>And now he could only support from the back, he was not at the level to fight in the front anymore.</p><br/><p>And the beasts in front of them would be even stronger.</p><br/><p>They at least had Hansoo before, if he had fought in between the others then he would\u2019ve died rather quickly.</p><br/><p>So he decided to wait for just 5 minutes.</p><br/><p>Just in case Hansoo would run away from the fight.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s a relief\u2019</p><br/><p>If he hadn\u2019t come then he would\u2019ve probably had to fight in the front while listening to their hateful words but thankfully Hansoo had come back.</p><br/><p>While Gyucheol was thinking about this and that, Hansoo had chosen a different direction than the others.</p><br/><p>If that path had been cleared already then the amount of runes he would be able to gain will be significantly lower.</p><br/><p>It was better to go somewhere where there was still a lot of things to hunt.</p><br/><p>And this path was more compatible with him.</p><br/><p>Gyucheol only looked at Hansoo pass by him but did not move.</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked at Gyucheol with an amused expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you moving?\u201d</p><br/><p>And Gyucheol relied at those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you were never part of us already. Go ahead first\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh\u201d</p><br/><p>These words were correct.</p><br/><p>\u2018I can clearly see his intentions but a guy being this straightforward is a first.\u2019</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t really matter if there was somebody to fight with or not.</p><br/><p>Hansoo laughed as he started to move towards the other path quickly.</p><br/><p>And Gyucheol and his family slowly followed Hansoo whilst leaving a gap.</p><br/><p>\u2018There\u2026 aren\u2019t any options left\u2019</p><br/><p>He was not at the level of fighting in the front anymore.</p><br/><p>He had to push ahead by sticking to someone.</p><br/><p>\u2018Surely such an environment like this wouldn\u2019t continue\u2019</p><br/><p>As long as a similar environment like the first tutorial area came out then they can catch their breath.</p><br/><p>Gyucheol started to gaze at Hansoo\u2019s back with a feeling of being on a tightrope.</p><br/><p>Hoping that he wouldn\u2019t get mad and turn his blades at them.</p><br/><p>And hoping that he would clear the road well in the front.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Udududk</p><br/><p>\u201cHooo\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo made a dull expression as he killed the last Kerudal.</p><br/><p>This place\u2019s difficulty was where nine people had to fight.</p><br/><p>It was hard because he had to fight alone.</p><br/><p>Since he couldn\u2019t use cloud snacks in places like this</p><br/><p>\u2018But it\u2019s still very good\u2019</p><br/><p>[Kang Hansoo]</p><br/><p>Strength(Colorless): 0.03%</p><br/><p>Stamina: 88.8</p><br/><p>Agility: 84.0</p><br/><p>Perception: 85.1</p><br/><p>Mana: 58.4</p><br/><p>Magic: 35</p><br/><p>Physical resistance: 32</p><br/><p>Magic resistance: 32.7</p><br/><p>He had been monopolizing the runes because he was fighting alone.</p><br/><p>And the fights had been getting easier because his resistances were increasing due to his monopolization.</p><br/><p>And Gyucheol was looking at Hansoo with a fed up expression from the back.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026he\u2019s getting stronger and stronger\u2019</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t seem like his movements were getting faster or his strength was increasing.</p><br/><p>But he was gaining a lot less injuries than before.</p><br/><p>And because of that he was fighting faster and more aggressively.</p><br/><p>He just took an attack that he would usually dodge and then sliced off their necks like that.</p><br/><p>And because of this his speed was slower than when he fought together with the other group but he had long recovered the speed back.</p><br/><p>\u2018This kinda bugs me\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>He was traveling safely and comfortably.</p><br/><p>He just had to pick up a few bloody monsters that Hansoo had leaked.</p><br/><p>And Gyucheol was sufficient enough for these.</p><br/><p>But the fact that Hansoo has been getting more and more leisurely had been bugging him.</p><br/><p>The perfect situation in his head was that Hansoo was so busy fighting in the front and becoming a mess that he couldn\u2019t spare any effort to care about Gyucheol himself.</p><br/><p>But if this happened he had no solution to when Hansoo became enraged..</p><br/><p>\u2018Do I have to run away in the next fork on the road\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>But it was hard for him to clear the road alone.</p><br/><p>But the thing that had appeared in front of Gyucheol wasn\u2019t a fork on the road.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026Tunnel?\u2019</p><br/><p>A giant tunnel located near the bottom of the mountain.</p><br/><p>And in front of it a very familiar existence was located there.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you not on good terms? You traveled whilst leaving some distance between you two. Well whatever, congratulations on reaching the goal.\u201d</p><br/><p>And then the fairy pointed towards the inner parts of the tunnel.</p><br/><p>There was a dormant volcano\u2019s crater that could be seen along with few tens of people who had already reached this place next to many weird-looking boats.</p><br/><p>Gyucheol cried out in joy after seeing this.</p><br/><p>\u201cUwahaha! Arrived! We\u2019ve Arrived!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDaddy! Thank you for your hard work!\u201d</p><br/><p>As if Hansoo and Gyucheol were the last ones, as soon as they entered the tunnel closed with a thunk sound and the fairy which was at the entrance flew in.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello everyone. Welcome to the goal line. Heehee. Let\u2019s see\u2026 there\u2019s 75 alive right now? It\u2019s good that not many died. You guys worked hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Whilst everyone was grinding their teeth, the fairy smiled as it spoke again.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince there\u2019s 75 people, 75 tickets should be prepared right?\u201d</p><br/><p>And then a ticket with strange patterns started to appear on the hands of the people.</p><br/><p>While the people were mumbling about the ticket, the fairy continued to talk.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you get on that then you can get on the boat that leads you to the island above. You\u2019ve done well. I will now tell you how to use the ticket.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t it just that they had to get on the boat after handing it over.</p><br/><p>\u201cBasically the boats you guys will get on is for three people\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd of course three tickets must be gathered in order for it to work. Isn\u2019t it so peaceful? Since its three tickets per three people, there\u2019s no need to fight\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone sighed in relief at these words.</p><br/><p>Since that meant that all 75 people could go up.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo shook his head.</p><br/><p>There was no way that this would be it.</p><br/><p>And as he expected, the fairy continued to talk.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut it will be unfair if one person or two people pay three tickets and get treated like three people right? So we prepared something special\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Goddamit, of course it won\u2019t just let us go that easily\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>The fairy made an amused expression as it looked at the people and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirstly, if you hand in three tickets then you can go to any island you want. By the way, if you think that all the islands above are the same then that\u2019s a huge misconception. Check the islands map in your pockets.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fairy laughed and spoke as it saw a few people\u2019s eyes shining.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you hand in three tickets with two people then you can go together but you cannot decide where it goes. The boat will move randomly\u201d</p><br/><p>At the fairy\u2019s words, the eyes of the people who were comrades or partners changed.</p><br/><p>If they wanted to act together then they had to gather an extra ticket.</p><br/><p>\u201cLastly if you hand in three tickets as three people then you will get off separately. You can go up but you cannot be together. A situation like a family would be very very sad right? I hope if you are in a family of three that you can gather nine tickets to go to the island you want.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis bitch\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Gyucheol spat out curses without control.</p><br/><p>Nine tickets for three people?</p><br/><p>What was this nonsense?</p><br/><p>It was hard to even protect one at this moment.</p><br/><p>He could see Hancheol and others watching with a fierce look from afar.</p><br/><p>And the fairy spoke in amusements without caring for such matters.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere should be about\u2026 30 minutes left until the island collapses completely? Heehee. I guess only 25 boats are needed. I will separate the boats all around the crater. It won\u2019t be fun if you just protect the area of the boat right? Ticket. You just need to gather three tickets with whichever method and then depart! Good luck!\u201d</p><br/><p>The fairy disappeared after those words.</p><br/><p>And everybody\u2019s faces started to stiffen.</p><br/><p>It was better to go together and even better if you could go where you wanted.</p><br/><p>So it was better the more tickets you had.</p><br/><p>If there were 6 in a party then 18 was optimal, 9 was ok and six was a worst case scenario.</p><br/><p>The people who had laid their decisions looked around for weak people.</p><br/><p>And Hancheol and the others who had been separated earlier looked at Gyucheol\u2019s family with a smile.</p><br/><p>The other didn\u2019t know but they did.</p><br/><p>A way to gain three free tickets.</p><br/><p>\u201cGoddamnit\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Gyucheol cursed out.</p><br/><p>The boat was next to them.</p><br/><p>If they wanted to live then the three of them had to get on the boat at this instant.</p><br/><p>But if they get on the boat like that then they would be separated.</p><br/><p>Which meant his wife and daughter will die or face an even worse situation.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn..what do I do?\u2019</p><br/><p>The fact that they had come this far proved that they were strong.</p><br/><p>So there was nobody who could get their tickets stolen by him.</p><br/><p>And then Hansoo came into Gyucheol\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cHansoo! Please give me your ticket!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Hansoo looked at Gyucheol, Gyucheol hurriedly smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we have your ticket then my wife and I can go together! And then please take my daughter. If you do so then our whole family can live!\u201d</p><br/><p>Gyucheol shouted in despair.</p><br/><p>Since then he could take his wife with him and protect her a bit more.</p><br/><p>And their daughter will be protected by Hansoo so she will be able to live a bit longer despite being separated.</p><br/><p>If there are four people with six tickets then they can live a bit longer.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease\u2026 You can save lives this way! You are strong so isn\u2019t a piece of cake to gather two more tickets? You\u2019re so strong! Please save our family!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Wow\u2026he\u2019s not a joke\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo swirled his tongue at Gyucheol\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>He had thought that he was very blunt but this was beyond imagination.</p><br/><p>\u2018He probably isn\u2019t a fool that would grant that right?\u2019</p><br/><p>But Hanchul was still worried so he started to run faster.</p><br/><p>Since if he did grant that then those tickets would be gone.</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry! Please!\u201d</p><br/><p>Gyucheol, who saw Hanchul and the others charge at them,</p><br/><p>He had pleaded something that wouldn\u2019t even come out because of his ego.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo\u2019s eyes calmed down in a cold manner as he looked at Gyucheol.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Does she have a personal grudge or something? Why is her expression like this?\u2019</p><br/><p>It was the first time he had seen Sharon Stiller\u2019s expression, which was usually always smiling and calm, scrunch up this much.</p><br/><p>As Flame Warrior-V was still in shock.</p><br/><p>Kiiiiiiing!</p><br/><p>The weapon in Sharon Stiller\u2019s hands started to heat up.</p><br/><p>While spewing out red light like a furnace bellowing out fire.</p><br/><p>At the same time.</p><br/><p>Boooooom!</p><br/><p>A giant flame scorched out and flew towards the bug player in front of her.</p><br/><p>A much more intense flame melted the walls of the maze and headed towards Hansoo.</p><br/><p>Hansoo frowned as he saw this.</p><br/><p>\u2018As I expected...I cannot win in a head on fight.\u2019</p><br/><p>The ones who had used the S grade Spirit Stones were no joke.</p><br/><p>Since it was a fragment which held the souls of the spirits which ruled this world at one point.</p><br/><p>Of course this much wasn\u2019t enough to beat him.</p><br/><p>But there were the Scarlet Demons and even 150 Gold Demons behind.</p><br/><p>And since they could fight without fear of death, it would be even worse.</p><br/><p>But there was a reason why he had come.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Not bad Kamiyou. A threat.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Not bad.\u2019</p><br/><p>He could buy at least two hours.</p><br/><p>Hansoo shrugged his shoulders and swirled up two dragons with his spear.</p><br/><p>Kuuududuk.</p><br/><p>As his body slightly got twisted.</p><br/><p>Booooom!</p><br/><p>Two dragons clashed into the inferno.</p><br/><p>The dragons which had killed the Gold Demons from before.</p><br/><p>Soon.</p><br/><p>Rummble!</p><br/><p>The entire maze shook from the collision of the dragon and the flame.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018...I can\u2019t get held back from just you.\u2019</p><br/><p>Sharon Stiller mumbled as she looked at the Scarlet Flower.</p><br/><p>A power which he had gained through large amounts of sacrifice.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t something which would go away simply by shutting the game off.</p><br/><p>It was strength which could give her honor, strength and a place on society in real life.</p><br/><p>And for this, she had to lick the soles of Himura temporarily.</p><br/><p>By using the strength he had given her.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ll erase you all\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cClean him up!\u201dThen.</p><br/><p>Rummblee!</p><br/><p>The Scarlet and Gold Demons started to charge at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Rumble.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fuck...Faster. Faste!\u2019</p><br/><p>Einchel got into an even bigger hurry from the vibration that shook the entire maze.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave behind the trailers! Just take the weapons!\u201dEinchel screamed out as she took the lead position instead of Kamiyou who had gone ahead.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck! How did those guys find out about us!\u201dIt was funny how she was pondering whether to go or not just a few moments ago.</p><br/><p>For the Scarlet Demons to crash in so suddenly.</p><br/><p>Einchel grinded her teeth while thinking of Christopher and the other blacklisters but then shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u2018No, it\u2019s not because of them. Fuck.\u2019</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t retards, they wouldn\u2019t have left behind such obvious tracks.</p><br/><p>And the location of collision was completely opposite from the direction they came from anyway.</p><br/><p>Well, all of this didn\u2019t matter anyway.</p><br/><p>\u2018There\u2019s...only one path now.\u2019</p><br/><p>Einchel mumbled inwardly as she looked towards Kamiyou shouting in the distance.</p><br/><p>Well, towards the skulls in Kamiyou\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>The skulls Hansoo had left behind before leaving.</p><br/><p>Hansoo told Kamiyou.</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded at Kamiyou\u2019s expression.</p><br/><p>Hansoo gave them a simple task.</p><br/><p>While he bought time, they had to clear a path to the seal.</p><br/><p>Einchel nodded as she flew towards the portal.</p><br/><p>\u2018Thats easy\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Whooosh!</p><br/><p>Einchel saw the last member of Ant Tunnel going through the portal and flew into the portal as well.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>The strange noise of the portal gulped in Einchel and led her to the fourth floor.</p><br/><p>Kamiyou quickly spoke to Einchel the moment she came out.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs everyone here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. But the method of finding the parth\u2026\u201dKamiyou nodded at those words.\u201cThat doesn\u2019t seem very hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>It might\u2019ve been hard if there were a lot of players but the secret tunnel had remained hidden from being discovered.</p><br/><p>And the players looking for the bug players actually helped them.Since most of them gathered around the other portals.</p><br/><p>\u2018We need to hurry.\u2019</p><br/><p>Kamiyou finished his thoughts and spoke towards the people.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dThen.</p><br/><p>Christopher spoke next to him as if he didn\u2019t like some things.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we just go by ourselves? We can break the seal by ourselves right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Christopher didn\u2019t like the fact that Hansoo was buying time for the people here.</p><br/><p>Of course he knew that them going against the players who couldn\u2019t die was meaningless and was basically suicide.</p><br/><p>But for them to hand over so many people to just one person.</p><br/><p>\u2018This...Isn\u2019t this too much?\u2019</p><br/><p>Of course Christopher didn\u2019t like the current situation.</p><br/><p>Kamiyou shook his head towards Christopher.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem that our path would be that safe.\u201d\u201c...?\u201d</p><br/><p>Oooooong.</p><br/><p>Slight vibrations of the skull guided Kamiyou.</p><br/><p>The vast and wide great maze.</p><br/><p>Towards the deepest parts.</p><br/><p>The Seal.</p><br/><p>The Great Seal.</p><br/><p>The thing which the kingdoms and the empires created to deal with the Ains.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Would hiding such a thing be the only way to protect it?\u2019</p><br/><p>Kamiyou gulped as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t fight between ourselves. Let\u2019s find the path first. Hansoo said he would buy time and then\u2026 Rejoin us.\u201d</p><br/><p>It wouldn\u2019t be hard to follow them since they would leave behind marks only themselves would recognize.</p><br/><p>Christopher made a displeased expression but nodded and started to move towards the darkness of the maze.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Shuaaaaaak!</p><br/><p>A Gold Demon member got surrounded by a cloud of red smoke while running through the maze.</p><br/><p>And he freaked out when he saw this.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Even before he could finish his scream.</p><br/><p>Kwaaaaarrrrrrk!</p><br/><p>The Gold Demon member melted down from the red spoke.</p><br/><p>And the other members were shocked as they saw this.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the fuck.\u201d\u201cWould that skill come out if we kill him?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Gold Demons freaked out but the Scarlet Demons merely shrugged their shoulders.</p><br/><p>They started to see positives and negatives.</p><br/><p>\u2018Dumbasses. Even if you guys get that skill, you guys wouldn\u2019t be able to use it because of your lack of mana. And fucking hell Exodus. Do your job properly.\u2019</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t know what kind of hack this guy used but this guy\u2019s health and mana were seriously abnormal.</p><br/><p>In other words, he was using that skill because of this.</p><br/><p>This was why the Scarlet Demons weren\u2019t in a hurry.</p><br/><p>Though he was strong, there was a limit to someone\u2019s mana.</p><br/><p>And that skill was indeed powerful but that guy was using it carefully.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t invincible.</p><br/><p>If he was invincible then he wouldn\u2019t have run away from the captain of the Scarlet Demons, Sharon Stiller.</p><br/><p>He would\u2019ve just melted down everyone here and then.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well. It does seem that it is disturbing her.\u2019</p><br/><p>One of the Scarlet Demons, Olsen, chuckled towards Sharon Stiller.</p><br/><p>It seems her pride had been tainted because she had left him an opening to run away while fighting one versus one.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Sharon Stiller spoke expressionlessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cSplit the team.\u201d\u201c...How?\u201d</p><br/><p>Vice-captain, Olsen, frowned at Sharon Stiller.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to drag out time against him. It\u2019s not like we will get a tremendous amount of exp for killing him. Ten Scarlet demons including me will chase him. That should be enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>Olsen nodded.</p><br/><p>Since losing hundreds of bug players because of one person would be a tremendous loss.</p><br/><p>And fighting up to this point, ten was more than enough to suppress him.</p><br/><p>\u2018His level isn\u2019t that high.\u2019</p><br/><p>If he was actually at level 250, he would\u2019ve been a monstrosity.</p><br/><p>But he was merely around level 200 to 205.</p><br/><p>Ten of them, armed with top tier Spirit Stones, were more than enough.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s better to do this than half-heartedly giving Gold Demons some exp.\u2019</p><br/><p>Olsen nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen the five including myself will chase the others.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sharon Stiller shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, only four of you go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? What about the remaining one?\u201d</p><br/><p>Olsen asked.</p><br/><p>There were 15 people in the Scarlet Demons.</p><br/><p>If ten followed that man and four chased bug players, there would be one left over.</p><br/><p>Sharon Stiller took something out as she spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just take care of the thing we promised the Kingdom on the way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm\u2026 That\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Olsen frowned.</p><br/><p>The blue pouch she had received from the captain of the magic brigade, Krancheska.</p><br/><p>\u2018What is it anyway?\u2019</p><br/><p>Olsen looked at Sharon with curiosity.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

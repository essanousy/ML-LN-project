How is this real?! What is this?!\u2019</p><br/><p>The size of a city.</p><br/><p>The research center\u2019s train wagon\u2019s were huge\u2014just one wagon was the size of a larger city.</p><br/><p>And the Fusion Reactor was divided into different sectors so even if a part of it were damaged it would still work.</p><br/><p>Theoretically, even if 60% of the Reactor were damaged the Quantum Transmission would still work.</p><br/><p>But she had never expected an entire wagon, the size of an entire city, to disappear in just an instant.</p><br/><p>Of course.</p><br/><p>How could the battles of these \u2018human\u2019-sized people be on such a large scale?</p><br/><p>But this was the reality.</p><br/><p>\u2026tata\u2026tatata\u2026 </p><br/><p>As N-Maria looked at the stark spot where the giant wagon had been.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. It doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019ll activate for quite a while?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, what were you saying to me before? Huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>A cold voice rang out throughout the area.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014boooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u201cArgh!\u201d</p><br/><p>R-Korun Nell screamed alongside the sound of a huge collision.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn!\u2019</p><br/><p>Both sounds woke up N-Maria from her daze.</p><br/><p>\u2018Noo\u2026 No!\u2019</p><br/><p>At this rate, everyone would die.</p><br/><p>Before, there was more than enough time to summon one more Dragon God Soldier.</p><br/><p>But not anymore.</p><br/><p>Now, Kiriel had more than enough time to kill them off before they could summon another Dragon God Soldier.</p><br/><p>N-Maria clenched her teeth and stared solemnly at R-Korun Nell, who was desperately trying to resist.</p><br/><p>\u2018Think. Think. THINK!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014clack\u2014clack\u2014clack\u2014clack\u2014 </p><br/><p>N-Maria\u2019s teeth trembled.</p><br/><p>She had to think of something.</p><br/><p>To solve this situation.</p><br/><p>If not, she would really end up dying.</p><br/><p>If she failed here, then her chances of survival would be close to zero.</p><br/><p>\u2018...The robots? Should I control them?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>But N-Maria shook off this thought as she heard more loud sounds of impact.</p><br/><p>No way.</p><br/><p>She\u2019d just melt them away before they could touch even a single strand of her hair.</p><br/><p>\u2018Threaten? That I wouldn\u2019t cooperate?\u2019</p><br/><p>She shook that thought off as well.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t know if she was needed anymore, and she wasn\u2019t confident either.</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t confident that she could withstand the possible torture that person would put her through.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2026 I have to reverse the situation!\u2019</p><br/><p>Whether it was helping the Dragon God Soldier or ending this fight.</p><br/><p>She had to stop it.</p><br/><p>And as N-Maria racked her brains.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhhh! You b****!\u201d</p><br/><p>R-Korun Nell extended his arm towards N-Maria.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014chrrkrkrk!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The Barrier Reactor on the ground flew towards R-Korun Nell.</p><br/><p>R-Korun Nell had concluded that there was no more hope for the Quantum Transmission and took back the Barrier Reactor, hoping to run away.</p><br/><p>R-Korun Nell had given up on the researchers who had no more value.</p><br/><p>N-Maria and the other researchers screamed at this scene.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhhh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! If you take that\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>N-Maria screamed.</p><br/><p>She would be exposed to her attacks now.</p><br/><p>Even if their bodies were enhanced, even a tiny fragment of energy from that battle could kill them.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn! And here I was trying to turn the situation\u2026!\u2019</p><br/><p>As N-Maria looked at R-Korun Nell with hateful eyes.</p><br/><p>Her gaze met R-Korun Nell\u2019s.</p><br/><p>And then realized.</p><br/><p>That she\u2019d deluded herself.</p><br/><p>\u2018...What have I done?\u2019</p><br/><p>Despite being pushed back, he was looking at her with worry.</p><br/><p>But there was no warmth behind those eyes.</p><br/><p>They were cold.</p><br/><p>Cold eyes that were worried that she would actually survive and not get killed.</p><br/><p>And after seeing those very eyes, N-Maria came to a realization.</p><br/><p>That her death had already been determined.</p><br/><p>The one that really wanted her dead was not that monster of a woman in the distance.</p><br/><p>Even if that woman didn\u2019t kill her.</p><br/><p>Even if R-Korun Nell won.</p><br/><p>They would die anyway.</p><br/><p>This place had a secret so important that the Nell family had even sent a Dragon God Soldier to hide it.</p><br/><p>How could they survive, even if they were only slightly related to the whole thing?</p><br/><p>Especially her, who had even illegally borrowed the Nell family member\u2019s emergency code to contact them.</p><br/><p>N-Martin\u2019s face flashed past her eyes.</p><br/><p>The man who believed that he had sacrificed himself for everyone.</p><br/><p>But she now had a revelation.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Bastard. He knew all along. That this would happen.\u2019</p><br/><p>And as she realized that her destiny had been set in stone.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha\u2026 Ahahahahaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>N-Maria started to laugh maniacally.</p><br/><p>\u2014boooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014boom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u201cAhhhh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNooo!\u201d</p><br/><p>N-Maria watched in despair as random fragments from the battle flew towards them, killing the researchers around her.</p><br/><p>For what had they struggled?</p><br/><p>\u2018And\u2026 he\u2019s the one killing us.\u2019</p><br/><p>Ironically, the one killing them wasn\u2019t Kiriel.</p><br/><p>R-Korun Nell, even as he ran away, was sending attacks towards her and the researchers.</p><br/><p>N-Maria\u2019s expression hardened.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yeah\u2026this is my final gift to you\u2026you\u2026.You damned Nell family.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014tatatatata!\u2014 </p><br/><p>N-Maria\u2019s fingers started to move quickly amidst the explosions around her.</p><br/><p>\u2014kiiiiing!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The research center started to whirl as N-Maria inputted her final commands.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s\u2026done.\u2019</p><br/><p>N-Maria dropped her hands with a satisfied expression.</p><br/><p>At least she\u2019d accomplished one of her goals before she died.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s see\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>As N-Maria scratched something on the ground and looked around the research center with a relieved expression\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014she heard a brainwave transmission in her head.</p><br/><p>As R-Korun Nell\u2019s message ended.</p><br/><p>\u2014whooosh!\u2014 </p><br/><p>A tremendous piece of structure flew towards them.</p><br/><p>R-Korun Nell had thrown it amidst his struggle to escape.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hah\u2026 I can read him like a book.\u2019</p><br/><p>N-Maria chuckled at this entirely expected situation.</p><br/><p>\u2018Whatever, struggle a bit longer if you wish. I\u2019m going to rest now.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014whooosh!\u2014 </p><br/><p>N-Maria closed her eyes as the house-sized piece of metal flew towards her.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2014boooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014crunch!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo felt disappointed as he looked at the armored being that was charging towards him again.</p><br/><p>\u2018Too bad. Could\u2019ve been an easy way out.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was an attack on the same level as one that used all nine of his dragons.</p><br/><p>Of course, an attack of that level had a price to pay.</p><br/><p>An attack that squeezed out every drop of mana in one\u2019s body to use.</p><br/><p>If he had dodged the attack a few more times, then it would\u2019ve run out of energy.</p><br/><p>But as Melchizedek started to control it, instead of firing out more of those strikes it instead contained the energy within its armor and charged towards him.</p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>His Thousand Soldiers Armor broke apart a little more every time it hit him.</p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo smashed her away with the Mjolnir and then checked his armor.</p><br/><p>\u2018I guess it lasted quite a while.\u2019</p><br/><p>The Thousand Soldiers Armor was an artifact that had existed during a time when the Abyss had still been closed.</p><br/><p>And it was soon time to replace it.</p><br/><p>\u2018Even if it's not an abyssal monster\u2026 I just need to defeat something strong, right?\u2019</p><br/><p>The Ark-Roa\u2019s core resonated with the blue armor in front of him.</p><br/><p>Which meant that they attracted each other.</p><br/><p>Which meant that he could combine them into one and receive a greater reward.</p><br/><p>\u2018Seriously, that fairy is the only one that takes care of me it seems.\u2019</p><br/><p>As Hansoo chuckled and grasped tightly onto Mjolnir.</p><br/><p>\u2014kiiing!\u2014 </p><br/><p>A strange wave of energy pulsed from the wagon.</p><br/><p>And as he sensed this.</p><br/><p>\u2014hooongg!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo frowned.</p><br/><p>He\u2019d felt this before.</p><br/><p>\u2018The Quantum Transmission has activated? Kiriel left that alone?\u2019</p><br/><p>According to what he knew, Kiriel shouldn\u2019t have lost in that situation.</p><br/><p>And as Hansoo was engrossed in his confusion\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014a mocking laugh came out from the blue-armored figure.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo replied simply:</p><br/><p>\u201cI need to be careful when I break you since I\u2019ll be using it next.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Melchizedek felt enraged at Hansoo, who seemed to look down on his invention.</p><br/><p>\u2014zoooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The Quantum Transmission activated in the distance.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201cQuantum Transmission. Activated!\u201d</p><br/><p>R-Koronaita Nell, the captain of the Kalkuroun fleet, started laughing gleefully.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha! Good! Send them in!\u201d</p><br/><p>Since they\u2019d been ready for quite a while, multiple Dragon God Soldiers quickly reported their statuses.</p><br/><p>\u2018Good, time for us to handle this now.\u2019</p><br/><p>For such scum to give them such an opportunity.</p><br/><p>R-Koronaita Nell decided to erase all those annoying alien members as he spoke to the leader of the fleet\u2019s Technorat team.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrepare and contact R-Korun Nell.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Tsk. If the communications aren\u2019t working properly, then you should be making it work.\u2019</p><br/><p>R-Koronaita Nell\u2019s good mood had been disturbed, and he was about to squeeze the technicians below, but then\u2014 </p><br/><p>N-Akuon, one of the Technorats in the cockpit, spoke out.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t work!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? The communications?\u201d</p><br/><p>N-Akuon shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026 The transmission won\u2019t work!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean! You said it was activated, right? You useless\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>N-Akuon made a wronged expression as he shouted:</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it's not a request for transmission, but the opposite!\u2026 It\u2019s transmitting something else over here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Huh? What?\u2019</p><br/><p>R-Koronaita Nell frowned at N-Akuon\u2019s words.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

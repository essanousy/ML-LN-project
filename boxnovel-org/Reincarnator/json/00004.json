He needed to find them before then.</p><br/><p>Hansoo got up from his spot.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m heading to Gangnam Station.\u2019</p><br/><p>The location of the first hidden piece was Gangnam Station.</p><br/><p>By the time Hansoo got up to start heading to that place there was already a chaotic situation.</p><br/><p>\u2018I knew this would happen.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo clicked his tongue at the screams from multiple directions.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you doing this!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAaahk! We will go separately!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo where! We need to group in order to survive!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the location where the battle ended, people were making an uproar here and there.</p><br/><p>\u2018Their opinions probably differed.\u2019</p><br/><p>There was a lot of small fights here and there.</p><br/><p>Between the people who wanted to act by themselves and those who wanted to group.</p><br/><p>Normally if their desires were that different it\u2019s normal to separate.</p><br/><p>Because there will only be problems if you hold onto somebody with a different opinion.</p><br/><p>But if one side wanted the other side a lot, and if for that they didn\u2019t want to let them go a problem occurs.</p><br/><p>Since there were over 100 people there were people who had more beauty than others.</p><br/><p>And for the same reason since there\u2019s 100 people there are a few who get used to the new world quickly as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh seriously!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly from the location where people were gathered a group with 3 males and 4 females dashed out and ran towards Hansoo\u2019s location.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2026.Hey, Where are you going!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018With that level of beauty\u2026 it will definitely be a problem.\u2019</p><br/><p>Maybe it was because they were at Gangnam Station and were brought here, their appearances were above average.</p><br/><p>And one was seriously of a different class.</p><br/><p>Suddenly one woman looked towards that side and shouted:</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will act separately! We are going to work with this person here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As Hansoo heard the frantic calls he frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Hansoo! Why are you pretending to not know us! We\u2019re acquaintances!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Oh. Right.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded then as if he just remembered.</p><br/><p>Because everyone died right off the start he didn\u2019t remember his college acquaintances.</p><br/><p>There was no way he could remember them after 50 years.</p><br/><p>He had forgotten already but after this situation occurred he started to remember it bit by bit.</p><br/><p>\u2018Oh yeah we came four to four. To get closer to each other.\u2019</p><br/><p>From the other side a thirty something looking man ran towards them while breathing excessively out of his nose and then was startled after he saw Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u2018That guy is\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>He remembered.</p><br/><p>The guy who was advancing as he crazily slashed apart the goblin looking beasts.</p><br/><p>He was so good at fighting that while the others were struggling with 2 to 3 of them he alone killed multiple tens of them.</p><br/><p>\u2018Does he do some sort of sport\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>The guy, Taesung kept contemplating.</p><br/><p>He understood that that guy was strong.</p><br/><p>But as the fairy told them before he was not at the level of transcended heroes and he was not alone.</p><br/><p>\u2018And he looks hurt too.\u2019</p><br/><p>As Hansoo saw the squirming Taesung, Hansoo clicked his tongue.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is why it\u2019s problematic.\u2019</p><br/><p>Normally they wouldn\u2019t even think of fighting.</p><br/><p>The hype of the battle has not yet disappeared.</p><br/><p>Their first injury and their first time with violence, and with the results on top of that giving them confidence could clearly be seen in their excitement.</p><br/><p>And the others were the same.</p><br/><p>\u2018It will be hard to judge with reason.\u2019</p><br/><p>There was no reason to have a scrimmage here.</p><br/><p>Since the time period where he got mad from these things to the point where he fought was long gone.</p><br/><p>And there was no reason to meet him again and there was no time to stay here either.</p><br/><p>Hansoo walked as his back faced the man who was staring at him.</p><br/><p>As Hansoo started to walk off fast, Taesung had a bewildered face and watched him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis bitch leaving a person in front of him\u2026 hey where are you going!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then Hansoo suddenly got curious.</p><br/><p>What this person would say to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there something you want to say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Do I set my age as 76 or 20?\u2019</p><br/><p>He wondered if he should be formal or informal but then he decided to go with the easier route.</p><br/><p>And from Hansoo\u2019s words Taesung made a shocked face.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? This young bitch\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Yeah. What do i say?\u2019</p><br/><p>To ask of something excessive, the previous actions of Hansoo\u2019s flying about crazily scared him but then to let him go the four women behind him were regretful.</p><br/><p>When Taesung was shocked the man who was standing behind him spoke with an impatient look.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t really bad people either. Let\u2019s act together. It seems like you eight are young, wouldn\u2019t it be better to work together? It seems there will be a lot of times where strength will be used from now on.\u201d</p><br/><p>And then the people who agreed with his words gathered behind him.</p><br/><p>\u2018No, it\u2019s not that they agreed.\u2019</p><br/><p>From the atmosphere it seemed like they knew each other.</p><br/><p>Hansoo stared at the man, who seemed like the leader, who had talked to him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hmm, his eyes\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>There were a lot of people like this.</p><br/><p>Those who get used to things way too quickly.</p><br/><p>No, it\u2019s more fitting to say that they were restricted in the world they used to live in.</p><br/><p>And now since those restrictions were gone, they were like a fish that had met water.</p><br/><p>Hansoo thought for a moment to choose between the dying wishes of Eres and Keldian and then made a decision.</p><br/><p>\u2018Eres you are saving a lot of people, I will let them go once.\u2019</p><br/><p>Honestly pulling out the roots when they hadn\u2019t done anything yet was not in his character.</p><br/><p>And even himself, his stats were still pretty average.</p><br/><p>He needed to get out but killing everyone here and leaving, the time for hidden pieces would be rather tight.</p><br/><p>Hansoo replied abruptly:</p><br/><p>\u201cDismissed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Having a lot of people wasn\u2019t bad.</p><br/><p>Since it made hunting much easier.</p><br/><p>But people who were even interested in funeral food were bound to make trouble.</p><br/><p>Hansoo, who had finished talking, searched around the goblin corpses and bound two more Podaos onto his waist and then started to walk.</p><br/><p>The remaining friends looked at each other in the eyes then followed him from behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis son of a bitch\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Taesung, who had been watching Hansoo, gritted his teeth and stepped forward but Giltae blocked him.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As Taesung watched his elder brother Giltae\u2019s actions with a weird look, Giltae opened his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t the time to be fighting with them. They\u2026 can be dealt with after everything is organized. We must first get this place in order.\u201d</p><br/><p>And then Giltae looked around at the 70 or so people remaining.</p><br/><p>The current situation was already chaotic.</p><br/><p>A strange place with strange beasts.</p><br/><p>And that damnable fairy too.</p><br/><p>Since it was already chaotic, keeping those who would make trouble would only be hard on him to control them.</p><br/><p>\u2018First, set the atmosphere here.\u2019</p><br/><p>From one view this chaotic period is a chance.</p><br/><p>Giltae stared at the location where they disappeared intensely for a while and then stomped his way into the crowd.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The man Taesoon stared at Hansoo, who was walking in front of him in a ragged manner, with a complicated look.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m not sure if this was the right move.\u2019</p><br/><p>But Taesoon shook his head.</p><br/><p>If they stayed in there a real division would\u2019ve occurred.</p><br/><p>Humans were scarier than goblins.</p><br/><p>And being next to this guy in front of his eyes made him feel safer.</p><br/><p>Logically it didn\u2019t make sense that being next to one person felt safer than 70 but that\u2019s how it was.</p><br/><p>\u2018Anyway\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>He knew that that guy was peculiar.</p><br/><p>Starting all the way back from OT he was in the corner in a daze. (*OT = Orientation)</p><br/><p>As if he was thinking of something different.</p><br/><p>And he also said he was an orphan.</p><br/><p>And from that he seemed like a weak target.</p><br/><p>The reason why he brought him today was because if there was somebody lesser than him around he would stand out more.</p><br/><p>\u2018tsk\u2019</p><br/><p>But he didn\u2019t know he was like that.</p><br/><p>As Taesoon remembered Hansoo fighting manically in the front, he watched Mihee with a regrettable face as she was staring at Hansoo. He then cleared his throat and spoke:</p><br/><p>\u201cHey Hansoo! Do you really not remember us?\u201d</p><br/><p>At those words Hansoo looked at Taesoon, who asked him, and then spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve gotten amnesia when we got here. I don\u2019t really remember much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey. Why did the way you talk turn like an old man\u2019s?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Does it show that much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mihee smiled softly at those words.</p><br/><p>Hansoo stared at her.</p><br/><p>The other three weren\u2019t bad but even out of them she had a beauty that stood out.</p><br/><p>At that level living life was pretty easy.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026but.\u2019</p><br/><p>In the Otherworld, beauty was a double edged sword.</p><br/><p>If you have the confidence to use it well it becomes a weapon but if you drop it then you invite all sorts of crooks.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well. She\u2019ll figure it out herself.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo stopped his thoughts and kept moving.</p><br/><p>Mihee stared at that Hansoo and spoke cautiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut where are you going right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo was constantly walking towards somewhere since the start.</p><br/><p>As if he knew the exact directions.</p><br/><p>Hansoo gave a short reply to that question.</p><br/><p>\u201cInside Gangnam Train Station.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy there?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo pondered for a moment.</p><br/><p>\u2018If I travel alone I don\u2019t need to explain all these but this is rather annoying.\u2019</p><br/><p>But since he decided to keep Eres\u2019s words as much as possible he gave a short reply instead.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting a feeling.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026feeling?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. It seems that with the loss of memory, I seem to have gained psychic powers. I\u2019m getting a feeling that I must go there.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was too annoying to explain every single bit and they will probably believe him if he said that he gained psychic powers.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well. Even fairies exist so if I say psychic powers they will understand somewhat.\u2019</p><br/><p>And he didn\u2019t really lie either.</p><br/><p>If one\u2019s actually really lucky they can get a rune with something called the sixth sense within it.</p><br/><p>Hansoo, who had organized things in a simple manner, started to walk forward and the others looked at Hansoo and made a weird expression.</p><br/><p>His actions were weird from the beginning but psychic powers.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Is it ok for us to follow that guy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jisun, who was standing behind Mihee, whispered to her boyfriend Gangtae softly.</p><br/><p>But they couldn\u2019t escape Hansoo\u2019s enhanced hearing.</p><br/><p>Hansoo smirked as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t really have to follow me. I\u2019m the type that respects personal preferences.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo, who headed forward without hesitation, went down the steps to the 12th exit that came into view.</p><br/><p>They made a meh-like face and then followed Hansoo.</p><br/><p>Honestly beasts more than humans, humans more than fairies gave them more of a fear from their plots.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019d be nice if he really had psychic powers.\u2019</p><br/><p>Taesoon, who was mumbling inwardly, went down to the train station and then looked at Hansoo then spoke after realizing.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! Are you preparing a place to live?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded at those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnfortunately there are some friends who already live here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kuuuaaaaak</p><br/><p>And then Hansoo slashed his Podao downwards.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

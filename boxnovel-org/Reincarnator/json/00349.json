Hold them down one-by-one?\u2019</p><br/><p>They\u2019d easily spit it out if they were tortured.</p><br/><p>But Kiriel signed out.</p><br/><p>\u2018That\u2019s not something we can do to an ally.\u2019</p><br/><p>Right now, she and Hansoo needed their strength.</p><br/><p>And it would be the same for the inhabitants of Angkara.</p><br/><p>Kiriel saw N-Maria walking hurriedly towards the two of them with a worried expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you really okay? The coating has not been finished\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>N-Maria looked at Hansoo\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>A body that was trained to the point of looking beast-like./having beast-like strength</p><br/><p>But N-Maria, the one who had invented the repulsion coating, could see the holes in the coating.</p><br/><p>In a situation where one would still feel uneasy even after smothering oneself with the coating, the sorry state of the coating on Hansoo\u2019s body weighed heavily on her mind.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hmm\u2026 Is she pretending?\u2019</p><br/><p>Whether she was really worried.</p><br/><p>Or pretending to worry.</p><br/><p>Kiriel glared at N-Maria.</p><br/><p>Hansoo chuckled as he said:</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said that it would take two more weeks to fully prepare again, right? Then\u2026those things will likely double in number.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were numerous methods if they had the time, the materials, and the manpower.</p><br/><p>But they were lacking in all three aspects at this moment.</p><br/><p>N-Maria looked in the direction Hansoo had pointed towards and fell silent.</p><br/><p>\u2018Mmm\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>The artificial transcendents that withstood against the flaming pillars that were falling down from the sky.</p><br/><p>And the tens of thousands of robot soldiers that marched in rows in front of the giant train.</p><br/><p>Even now, a countless number of these soldiers were being created and sent out from inside the train.</p><br/><p>It looked as if they were preparing to meet a special guest.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Melchizedek, you\u2019re really going overboard now.\u2019</p><br/><p>N-Maria clenched her teeth as she looked at the soldiers.</p><br/><p>Melchizedek was no longer laying low and was openly going against them now.</p><br/><p>If this monster they were standing on arrived at the Neropa Union then all these soldiers and artificial transcendents would descend down onto Angkara.</p><br/><p>\u2018And if they take over the Plant\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>The problem would become even worse.</p><br/><p>\u2018No, I must stop it.\u2019</p><br/><p>N-Maria started to tremble.</p><br/><p>Did she come all the way to this isolated place just to lament about her fate?</p><br/><p>She had to change this.</p><br/><p>For him.</p><br/><p>\u2018B-Kellan\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>N-Maria mumbled someone\u2019s name and then looked towards Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo...while you breach through their defenses, you want us to sneak inside and take over the control center, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The enemy\u2019s forces were mainly divided into two groups.</p><br/><p>The small elite, which comprised of the artificial transcendents.</p><br/><p>And the mass-produced soldiers.</p><br/><p>The former would be hard to take over, but the latter was a different story.</p><br/><p>If they could connect this armored research vehicle, , to the control center then they would succeed.</p><br/><p>And of course, they had the ability to.</p><br/><p>\u2018Haa\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>The look in N-Maria\u2019s eyes changed; they were now much more focused and filled with resolution.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s begin then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as Hansoo replied\u2014 </p><br/><p>ssssss\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2014red smoke began to surround Hansoo\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>Lightning crashed down from the clouds.</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Countless cracks appeared on the ground.</p><br/><p>With the swing of a hammer, lightning blew dozens of soldiers away, like leaves in front of a powerful gale.</p><br/><p>\u2014whooosh\u2014 </p><br/><p>Red smoke spread out and entered the bodies of the artificial transcendents.</p><br/><p>\u2014szzzzzt\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014crack!\u2014 </p><br/><p>As the artificial transcendents slumped forward, their skin melting down and their bones shattering from inside, two more flaming pillars fell down from the sky and swept over Hansoo and everyone around him.</p><br/><p>\u2014boooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Though the red smoke was a skill, it was still made up of organisms in the end.</p><br/><p>Because the organisms hadn\u2019t received the repulsion coating and had no resistance to fire, they stuttered for a bit when the flaming pillar struck down.</p><br/><p>The artificial transcendents jumped into the fire as if they were taking a shower, and then started to charge at Hansoo again.</p><br/><p>To crush his head in.</p><br/><p>Hansoo stood in the center and smiled at the artificial transcendents charging towards him, his skin still burning.</p><br/><p>The photon strikes and the attacks of the artificial transcendents.</p><br/><p>As well as the numerous foot soldiers.</p><br/><p>An attack that would have been a threat to him in the past.</p><br/><p>But now, Hansoo only laughed as he swung his hammer.</p><br/><p>\u2018Even if the coating is incomplete\u2026 it\u2019s still useful.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014boooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s right arm smacked away the artificial transcendents, and they crashed into the foot soldiers behind them and rolled into a ball together.</p><br/><p>In the small gap he had created after blowing them away, Hansoo raised his hammer to the sky.</p><br/><p>Kakagagaka! </p><br/><p>Five dragons extended out from his heart and started to compress themselves above the hammer.</p><br/><p>\u2014booooooooooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>When the blackened Mjolnir smashed the ground at Hansoo\u2019s feet, it created a shockwave unlike anything seen before now.</p><br/><p>Even Nelkipa\u2019s bright skin, which hadn\u2019t reacted to anything else other than the photon strikes, had hardened in just a moment.</p><br/><p>Nelkipa\u2019s skin, which looked like it was about to break apart, quickly crystallized as it repelled the force of the Nine Dragons Spear, no, the Nine Dragons Strike.</p><br/><p>A good turn of events for Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u2014boobooboooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The repelled force rose back up and smashed the countless soldiers surrounding Hansoo.</p><br/><p>Hundreds of soldiers turned into dust in an instant, and it even shredded apart two artificial transcendents as well.</p><br/><p>And N-Maria watched this entire scene in a dumbfounded daze.</p><br/><p>\u2018What in the world\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>The strength of that attack was slightly stronger than even the main attacks from a mid-sized cruiser.</p><br/><p>Only a select few of Angkara\u2019s ships had the rights to control Angkara\u2019s , and for this man to be able to wield a power stronger than that with only his body\u2026</p><br/><p>But N-Maria quickly regained her senses and shouted:</p><br/><p>\u201cCharge at them!\u201d</p><br/><p>The B and A levels, who were also watching this scene in a daze, woke up and started to focus on their work as well.</p><br/><p>And soon, the giant armored vehicle charged through the path that Hansoo had created, towards the giant research center in the distance.</p><br/><p>\u2014brrrrr!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2018This is seriously just insane\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>N-Maria clenched her teeth.</p><br/><p>Though she had executed the plan because she had to, actually experiencing the situation was a whole other thing.</p><br/><p>She had never expected to get mixed up with such a stupid plan in her life.</p><br/><p>Though Hansoo was clearing the way in the front, the enemy still had a tremendous number of forces left.</p><br/><p>Plus, countless artillery fires and the flaming pillars continuously rained down from above.</p><br/><p>\u2014booooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014tink!

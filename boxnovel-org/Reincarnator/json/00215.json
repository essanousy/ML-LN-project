Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><br/><p>The Gael-Tara followed Hansoo\u2019s commands as it charged forward.</p><br/><p>Towards the Silver Sea where it had been born.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><br/><p>A 3 km tall organism leaped over mountains and crossed over the lands while causing earthquakes.</p><br/><p>Inside the control room where the bubbling sounds and the sounds of the Gael-Tara running were resounding, Metiron continued to babble on as if he still had some strength to live.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re dying like this as well. Not bad. Though I can\u2019t perform the revenge on my own but this isn\u2019t bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo chuckled at those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing I kept you alive. It won\u2019t be boring until I get to the Silver Sea.\u201d.</p><br/><p>Metiron chuckled.</p><br/><p>He was going to die anyway.</p><br/><p>As the consequences of him overloading his body from the Mana Jade still remained.</p><br/><p>It was beyond something that could be healed through runes.</p><br/><p>But this Hansoo guy will have the same fate as him anyway.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell. Thankfully the road to death won\u2019t be boring for me as well. Since you\u2019ll be coming with me. You know already, right? That you can\u2019t escape from here anymore?\u201d</p><br/><p>Metiron then looked around.</p><br/><p>The liquid metal was bubbling.</p><br/><p>It looked soft but he wouldn\u2019t be able to go through it.</p><br/><p>As the mana inside that thing will turn anybody trying to get through it into dust in an instant.</p><br/><p>Going through that was basically the same as a normal human trying to walk through lava.</p><br/><p>And to traverse it from all the way inside to the outside.</p><br/><p>An impossible feat.</p><br/><p>He had lied to his comrades.</p><br/><p>In case they might get swept by the explosion along with him.</p><br/><p>Metiron chuckled at Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a saint. A hero of humankind.\u201d</p><br/><p>No matter how amazing this Hansoo guy was he wouldn\u2019t be able to survive the explosion.</p><br/><p>It was an explosion that could send a continent flying.</p><br/><p>A human being wouldn\u2019t survive such a thing.</p><br/><p>Hansoo chuckled back at Metiron.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it the same for you? Since you protected this place with your life on the line for Clementine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...\u201d</p><br/><p>Metiron became quiet at Hansoo\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked at Metiron.</p><br/><p>Others didn\u2019t but Hansoo knew.</p><br/><p>One of 8 closest persons to Clementine.</p><br/><p>Shin Taehee and the others of the eight Dark Lords didn\u2019t follow Clementine because they had been forced to.</p><br/><p>They followed Clementine because they felt a common ground with her and respected her.</p><br/><p>As these guys would already follow Clementine\u2019s orders to death even without the Soul Fragment.</p><br/><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><br/><p>As the noisy Metiron shut his mouth, the control room of the Gael-Tara was just filled with running noises.</p><br/><p>But as if Metiron didn\u2019t like this atmosphere or just didn\u2019t like Hansoo, he broke the silence and spoke again.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut even so, if I was you then I would\u2019ve sent an underling in here instead.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were a lot of reasons why he sacrificed himself for Clementine but there was one distinct reason.</p><br/><p>He believed that Clementine could do things he wouldn\u2019t be able to.</p><br/><p>This was why he had stayed behind in the Yellow Zone with his life on the line.</p><br/><p>But this Hansoo was different.</p><br/><p>With regards to his group, Hansoo was like Clementine.</p><br/><p>Somebody who was in charge of all the forces and the one who would deal with everything.</p><br/><p>But for somebody like that to crawl into such a dangerous place.</p><br/><p>He was sure.</p><br/><p>That without Hansoo, all the other people wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything.</p><br/><p>Even if they climb up they\u2019ll fight with each other and eventually disband.</p><br/><p>With this thought, he could suddenly feel the amount of weight Hansoo was holding up.</p><br/><p>\u2018Maybe\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Metiron stopped for a moment but then shook his head.</p><br/><p>He was starting to think useless things as his death was getting closer.</p><br/><p>Clementine had much more ability and was much stronger than Hansoo anyway.</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell. I agree with you to a certain degree. But since it has come to this, I can\u2019t dodge it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><br/><p>Hansoo mumbled as he felt the tremblings caused by Gael-Tara\u2019s running.</p><br/><p>The current situation was really dire.</p><br/><p>Even he couldn\u2019t escape it.</p><br/><p>But because of the amount of weight on his shoulders, he could not die here.</p><br/><p>Actually, even if he knew beforehand it would result like this things wouldn\u2019t have changed.</p><br/><p>Since this was by far the best choice he could have made.</p><br/><p>Even if he hadn\u2019t come, this thing would have become a bomb anyway.</p><br/><p>Because Metiron had touched it.</p><br/><p>Even if he knew this thing would self destruct later, he would\u2019ve come in anyway.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t anybody to kill Metiron other than him and if that happened then everybody would have died by Metiron\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>Actually he could have come out right after he had met Karmen and this thing hadn\u2019t turned into a bomb yet.</p><br/><p>As it hadn\u2019t heated up as much and he could have come out.</p><br/><p>But he still wouldn\u2019t have come out.</p><br/><p>Everybody would have died from the explosion radius if it was left alone.</p><br/><p>This situation was something that was bound to happen.</p><br/><p>Ever since he came up here, fought with the Higher Races and started to get tangled with the Sages and Metiron.</p><br/><p>\u2018No regrets.\u2019</p><br/><p>Boom! Clash! Clash!</p><br/><p>Hansoo mumbled as the Gael-Tara slowly headed into the Silver Sea.</p><br/><p>Chiiiiiiiiik!</p><br/><p>The Silver Sea cooled down the heated up Gael-Tara but it was not even close to being enough.</p><br/><p>Deeper, he had to go in deeper.</p><br/><p>Until this thing got submerged entirely.</p><br/><p>Kiiiiiii!</p><br/><p>It was so heated that the heat was now even reaching the control room.</p><br/><p>The glass windows cracked and the floor started to bubble up.</p><br/><p>Which meant that it was about to blow up.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Bubble bubble.</p><br/><p>The Gael-Tara reached the depths of the Silver Sea and started to fall.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeeeup.\u201d</p><br/><p>After sensing it started to sink, Hansoo let go of the controls, breathed in and out and warmed up.</p><br/><p>As the controls were released, the Gael-Tara struggled and try to go out but it was useless.</p><br/><p>Though it was 3km tall, the Silver Sea was tremendously wide and deep.</p><br/><p>Metiron chuckled as he saw this.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Are you preparing for your death?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo cracked his joints as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cI just said I have no regrets, I never said I\u2019ll die without any regrets.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI need to try as much as I can.\u201d</p><br/><p>Silver Sea.</p><br/><p>This was the tunnel to the next zone.</p><br/><p>If one goes into the Silver Sea and drinks the water then they would move on to the next world.</p><br/><p>Which meant that he could live.</p><br/><p>Though he wouldn\u2019t be able to escape the explosion radius, he just needed to run away to the next Zone.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo? You have a way of getting through it?\u201d</p><br/><p>This giant body, surrounded by the silver liquid, was a jail in itself.</p><br/><p>Actually the body that had been heated up from the mana had cooled down a bit from the Silver Sea.</p><br/><p>But then it was even more impossible to penetrate through the body since it had hardened up.</p><br/><p>\u2018Impossible.\u2019</p><br/><p>He, who had fought with him, knew better than to think that.</p><br/><p>And like his expectation.</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded.</p><br/><p>He knew it was a long shot with his current abilities.</p><br/><p>He had a powerful body and a lot of mana.</p><br/><p>His artifacts were top class as well.</p><br/><p>But he lacked skills.</p><br/><p>The skills he had were Zero Numbering.</p><br/><p>They were a top class skills anywhere.</p><br/><p>But they weren\u2019t suited for the current situation.</p><br/><p>The Pandemic Blade was too lacking to penetrate through this thing.</p><br/><p>The Pandemic blade was set for mass murder and didn\u2019t really have a lot of destructive force.</p><br/><p>Same for the Demonic Dragon\u2019s Reinforcement.</p><br/><p>Though the Demonic Dragon\u2019s Reinforcement was a top class reinforcement, it couldn\u2019t beat an attack skill in terms of destructive force.</p><br/><p>It was nowhere close actually.</p><br/><p>As the fact that it was balanced actually meant that it didn\u2019t excel in any of the fields.</p><br/><p>\u201cPhew.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo sensed his body having healed and then yelled into the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome out.\u201d</p><br/><p>The final card he believed in.</p><br/><p>As Hansoo breathed in and out.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? I was watching comfortably.\u201d</p><br/><p>A translucent shadow trembled in the air and then a fairy appeared.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

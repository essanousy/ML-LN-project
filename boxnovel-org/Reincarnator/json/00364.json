(1)</p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo frowned as he stared at the monster furiously attacking him.</p><br/><p>\u2018God damn it.\u2019</p><br/><p>Quirae.</p><br/><p>Integrating the genes of the things it\u2019s eaten to reinforce its weak points and strengthen its strong points.</p><br/><p>They repeated this and strengthened their race as a whole.</p><br/><p>Their strength hugely depended on what they ate.</p><br/><p>So Hansoo knew\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014that this strength was not something that came from eating humans.</p><br/><p>\u2026ssssss\u2026 </p><br/><p>Hansoo frowned as he felt the 4th-level monster threatening to break apart his arm.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t much different from before in terms of looks.</p><br/><p>The Quirae\u2019s armor-like exoskeleton was still there, and if one ignored the spikes on the back of their bodies, they still looked like armored humans.</p><br/><p>The issue was what was inside of it.</p><br/><p>If the thing inside the armor was once a human, it was something much more cruel and evil now.</p><br/><p>A new race.</p><br/><p>\u2018The original owners of the blue armor\u2026 they seem to have been quite strong.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>A force shocked his entire body, and not even his evolved blue armor could handle it, even as it sucked in energy at an insane rate.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t have anything particularly special about them.</p><br/><p>But they had focused on their abilities as a \u2018lifeform\u2019.</p><br/><p>Powerful physical strength.</p><br/><p>Endless vitality.</p><br/><p>Powerful defense and adaptability.</p><br/><p>Overflowing mana.</p><br/><p>Whatever it had eaten, the Quirae had definitely eaten something with immense physical abilities.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo thought of a race.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is what I wanted to become.\u2019</p><br/><p>Change a weak body to something powerful, providing a tremendous amount of adaptability with the Spirits.</p><br/><p>Generate mana with the Mana Jade and a powerful life force from the World Tree.</p><br/><p>Gain the weapon from this zone and continue upwards.</p><br/><p>Although the ones in front of his eyes didn\u2019t have the Dragon God Armor, it was almost similar since of the Quirae\u2019s hard exoskeleton.</p><br/><p>Although he had to open the Abyss due to a change in plans, if he hadn\u2019t done so then he would\u2019ve first taken over Nelkipa and then headed towards the moon which stored the Dragon God Armors, the .</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, the story\u2019s a little different now.\u2019</p><br/><p>Lost in thought, Hansoo swung his hammer and smashed down at the head of the 4th-level Quirae.</p><br/><p>\u2014boom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The Quirae\u2019s exoskeleton, which was as hard or even harder than the Dragon God Armor, smashed apart and its inner flesh crushed.</p><br/><p>\u2014kiiiing!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The blue armor went berserk as it started crazily sucking in Hansoo\u2019s energy.</p><br/><p>And the blue armor condensed all around Hansoo\u2019s body and released the stored energy inside it, providing him with powerful strength.</p><br/><p>As if it were saying that it couldn\u2019t let its precious host die.</p><br/><p>\u2014crunch!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s original strength had combined with that of the blue armor\u2019s.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo used this newfound strength to grab onto the Quirae\u2019s mouth that had opened up wide.</p><br/><p>\u2014split!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The mouth that could even crush the city\u2019s alloy walls couldn\u2019t withstand Hansoo\u2019s strength, and he ripped it apart.</p><br/><p>But even as it died, the 4th-level monster grasped Hansoo\u2019s arms as he ripped apart its mouth.</p><br/><p>\u2014crunch!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Literally overflowing with life force\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014the 4th-level Quirae continued to survive and linger on.</p><br/><p>Kyaaaak!</p><br/><p>And as if the others couldn\u2019t waste the small chance that 4th-level Quirae had created for them, the surrounding 2nd and 3rd-level Quirae screamed as they charged towards him.</p><br/><p>Hansoo scoffed at this sight and squeezed out the mana in his body.</p><br/><p>And the Mana Jade made a strange sound similar to a complaint, since the blue armor was already draining it.</p><br/><p>As if complaining about how this was all too much for it to take.</p><br/><p>But apparently the Mana Jade knew that it was also nothing without its owner, and it seemed strain itself to squeeze out more mana. </p><br/><p>Soon the blue mana turned red.</p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s Pandemic Blade exploded out from his body and surrounded him.</p><br/><p>\u2014swoooosh!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u201cKya\u2026 kuhak!\u201d</p><br/><p>The 3rd-level Quirae managed to withstand the Pandemic Blade before it started to melt down like snow under a blazing sun.</p><br/><p>Hansoo breathed in deeply as he examined this new strength from the Pandemic Blade.</p><br/><p>It was growing.</p><br/><p>The Immortal Soul was continuously growing from the outside stimulus.</p><br/><p>As his Immortal Soul grew, he also became stronger.</p><br/><p>And as his overall strength rose, his Pandemic Blade became stronger as well.</p><br/><p>Stimulus and battle created powerful beings.</p><br/><p>Like a steel-blade being tempered with every swing of a hammer, he became stronger every time his path was blocked.</p><br/><p>He continued to grow and became stronger.</p><br/><p>\u2018But it\u2019s still\u2026 not easy.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo smashed away the 4th-level Quirae after covering his hammer with the Nine Dragons Strike and frowned.</p><br/><p>Melchizedek wasn\u2019t suppressing their growth since it just needed to teleport them away.</p><br/><p>And as if they were thankful about it, the Quirae didn\u2019t go against Melchizedek and only focused on increasing their forces.</p><br/><p>The result of their collaboration was beyond reason.</p><br/><p>Despite having crushed countless 4th-level Quirae, they continued to crawl out from the depths.</p><br/><p>Unlike the 2nd and 3rd-levels who seemed numb to the deaths of their comrades, the other 4th-levels screamed at seeing the deaths of their own kind and charged at him crazily.</p><br/><p>Towards him, who was killing their kind, but could still strengthen himself.</p><br/><p>A precious food source.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo frowned at this.</p><br/><p>\u2018...I cannot get past them at this rate.\u2019</p><br/><p>No, he could buy time.</p><br/><p>But at this rate, Melchizedek would activate the Quantum Transmission.</p><br/><p>And at this rate, he\u2019d fail to escape this place as well.</p><br/><p>He and Kiriel would fail at becoming stronger, and Enbi Arin would die.</p><br/><p>\u2018Kiriel. What are you doing now?\u2019</p><br/><p>Because the Quirae had devoured another race, an unknown variable had occurred.</p><br/><p>And he needed a new variable as well.</p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo smashed away a Quirae charging towards him and looked into the distance.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe inner area is a bit a different from the outskirts. Those things are really vicious\u2026 ugh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiriel, covered in the green liquid, frowned as she heard N-Aroel\u2019s speech.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what was your original plan?\u201d</p><br/><p>N-Aroel pointed with trembling fingers.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you go a bit off from the central area\u2026 there\u2019s a control center where you can control Mimir and the Fusion Reactor. Even if you don\u2019t break the Quantum Transmission machine, you can still stop it. Damn! I didn\u2019t mean that we should head towards the center!\u201d</p><br/><p>The nine Dragon God Soldiers, including R-Zairon Nell, frowned.</p><br/><p>But they still didn\u2019t feel good about this.</p><br/><p>\u2018Slightly off from the center\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>According to the current pattern, these things were stronger the closer they got to the center. Moving slightly away from the center wasn\u2019t enough to make them sigh in relief.</p><br/><p>Not when they were looking at the corpse of the 4th-level Quirae in front of them.</p><br/><p>And their gruesome expressions proved it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaa\u2026 Haaaa.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit\u2026 You\u2019re telling me that these things will swarm us once we go deeper?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh\u2026 Captain. Can\u2019t we just go around?\u201d</p><br/><p>The two 4th-level Quirae.</p><br/><p>They\u2019d almost died from just dealing with two.</p><br/><p>No, if that woman called Kiriel hadn\u2019t helped, then at least one or two of them would\u2019ve died.</p><br/><p>\u2018But she wants to go into the same place these things are swarming?\u2019</p><br/><p>The Dragon God Soldiers freaked out.</p><br/><p>Even if they\u2019d lost the strength from the Flame, they would have a higher survival rate if they hid in the outskirts.</p><br/><p>Dying like this\u2014it would be a worthless death.</p><br/><p>And R-Zairon Nell thought so too.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Should we escape?\u2019</p><br/><p>Charging in was only possible when they had a chance at winning.</p><br/><p>Even if it were the outer areas of the center, the Quirae would rip them apart.</p><br/><p>Since countless others would swarm in while they were busy fighting a few.</p><br/><p>\u2018Dammit\u2026 How can a race like this exist?\u2019</p><br/><p>&lt;...Analyzation Impossible.&gt;</p><br/><p>Words continuously appeared on the panel while they scanned this 4th-level monster, but every sentence was full of errors and failures.</p><br/><p>The aliens and these insects were annoying enough, but for these things to be on Nelkipa\u2026 </p><br/><p>\u2018Damn\u2026 Right. This whole Nelkipa is suspicious too\u2026 We need to take into account the other variables as well.\u2019</p><br/><p>R-Zairon Nell made a decision.</p><br/><p>To retreat.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll retreat. There\u2026 is no chance of survival at this rate.\u201d</p><br/><p>All the other Dragon God Soldiers nodded.</p><br/><p>They could only move forward by paying with their lives.</p><br/><p>They\u2019d fought for a very long time and knew that reality was colder and harsher beyond reason.</p><br/><p>But at that moment\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014a single streak of light ascended into the sky.</p><br/><p>It looked like a skill had created it.</p><br/><p>And Kiriel sighed in relief as she spoke to the surrounding Dragon God Soldiers and N-Aroel.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go inside.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...I told you. It\u2019s the end if we go in and get surrounded.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014crack\u2014 </p><br/><p>R-Zairon Nell stepped on a corpse by his feet and shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you, I\u2019m not alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018I trust in you, Hansoo.\u2019</p><br/><p>Kiriel giggled as she looked at the bright and blue light that had risen far up into the sky.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cPhew. I know she\u2019lld understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo breathed in and out and then looked towards the hole projecting the bright blue light.</p><br/><p>Although it was originally covered by a metal wall, the 4th-level Quirae had broken past it in a hurry.</p><br/><p>It was impossible to get to the Quantum Transmission machine in time.</p><br/><p>But Kiriel would do it.</p><br/><p>She was a smart child.</p><br/><p>He just had one job.</p><br/><p>To create a path for them.</p><br/><p>Also, he was curious.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s see\u2026 what could be inside?\u2019</p><br/><p>As to why these things were trying to stop him from entering.</p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo started to charge towards the giant hole where countless Quirae had formed a blockade, preventing him from advancing further.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

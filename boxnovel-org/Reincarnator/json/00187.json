There\u2019s a bed there too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I\u2019ve heard of stone beds but this is a first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Karhal tapped the metal bed, which only looked comfy but was quite hard, and gave up as he just sat upon it.</p><br/><p>Hansoo stared at Junghwan and then spoke out.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are right now doing something that you cannot handle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo wanted to use the King\u2019s Crown in order to smash through the next stage.</p><br/><p>Where the birdcage and Metiron were at.</p><br/><p>Once he got through then the Destruction Jade would be right in front of him.</p><br/><p>But he hadn\u2019t even thought about taking over the entire maze.</p><br/><p>Junghwan had given up his physical body in order to obtain the maze and had transferred his soul and consciousness onto it.</p><br/><p>\u2018He crossed a river he cannot cross back on.\u2019</p><br/><p>He would never be able to return to the body of a human anymore.</p><br/><p>The metal Junghwan smiled at those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my own issue.\u201d</p><br/><p>A tremendous amount of strength which could be felt from his entire body.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Junghwan laughed coldly at those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something I want to say before that. Would you take a look here?\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment he finished talking.</p><br/><p>Chijijijik</p><br/><p>The TV, which seemed to just be decor, suddenly shook.</p><br/><p>At the same time thousands of detailed sculptures appeared on the insides of it.</p><br/><p>Like a real TV.</p><br/><p>\u201cThough it\u2019s black and white it should do the trick. Oh by the way this isn\u2019t a Sci-Fi movie but live.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as Junghwan\u2019s words ended.</p><br/><p>Chiiiirrrring</p><br/><p>The sculptures inside the screen moved according to Junghwan\u2019s will.</p><br/><p>Karhal was shocked at those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Though Junghwan told him it was live, a scene which looked like an SF movie was seen.</p><br/><p>Since tens of Satellite Fortresses were moving in a hurried manner.</p><br/><p>If they saw it with their own eyes then they would only be able to exclaim out in shock.</p><br/><p>Even a single one felt majestic up close.</p><br/><p>Tens of Satellite Fortresses moving together was like a scene from a movie.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo frowned as he saw this.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026They started to move?\u2019</p><br/><p>The movements of the Satellite Fortresses were changing.</p><br/><p>The Satellite Fortresses which were on guard against each other suddenly spread out.</p><br/><p>Towards the villages spread out.</p><br/><p>Some towards the air of the Green Road.</p><br/><p>All three races at the same time.</p><br/><p>Junghwan laughed as he looked at Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m just showing you their movements, I have no idea why they\u2019re doing this. But I think you do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo then looked at the Akion in his hands.</p><br/><p>At the same time he looked at the armor the Judge had on before.</p><br/><p>Every bit of action Akitrus had done got replayed in his head.</p><br/><p>The first thing was what he had done right before he died.</p><br/><p>His face and his iris.</p><br/><p>And the direction the iris was staring towards.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026Ring.\u2019</p><br/><p>That iris was definitely staring at his ring.</p><br/><p>Nurmaha\u2019s ring.</p><br/><p>Numerous possibilities flashed past in Hansoo\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>And then Hansoo was able to pin one down.</p><br/><p>\u2018Clementine.\u2019</p><br/><p>Him causing a ruckus here wouldn\u2019t be close to enough to cause the three races to unite.</p><br/><p>He was weak compared to their entire army and they didn\u2019t know the secrets of the world.</p><br/><p>But if they treated him as a part of Clementine\u2019s plan.</p><br/><p>If the person who had taken down a Satellite Fortress and killed the Judge was on the side of Metiron then they wouldn\u2019t be able to hold back anymore.</p><br/><p>Since Metiron had the Destruction Jade.</p><br/><p>At this rate a tremendous amount of people will get killed even before he could activate the Destruction Jade.</p><br/><p>He needed to move as quickly as possible.</p><br/><p>And he needed to crown to do that.</p><br/><p>He needed this huge King\u2019s tomb that was being controlled by the crown.</p><br/><p>\u2018I can\u2019t use the Akion.\u2019</p><br/><p>He had infected it with the Dark Cloud but he didn\u2019t have a source of energy.</p><br/><p>Since the Satellite Fortresses wouldn\u2019t allow any energy to be sent.</p><br/><p>The moment Hansoo grasped the Forked Lightning in his hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo no.\u201d</p><br/><p>Crunch</p><br/><p>Junghwan flicked his remaining left hand as he saw Hansoo.</p><br/><p>This was inside his stomach.</p><br/><p>He was a god in here.</p><br/><p>Kuaaaaaa!</p><br/><p>Booooom!</p><br/><p>Junghwan\u2019s body fell down onto the ground like a broken dish.</p><br/><p>At the same time the room Junghwan disappeared from had the furniture spin around in a tornado like fashion.</p><br/><p>Towards the three in the center of the room.</p><br/><p>Crunch</p><br/><p>Crackle</p><br/><p>\u201cHuaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ekidu and Karhal, who had been sitting on the bed, suddenly got eaten by the wall.</p><br/><p>\u201cGoddami\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Boom! Boom!</p><br/><p>A few explosive sounds were heard from the metal wall which had swallowed them but it was only for a moment.</p><br/><p>And soon the two of them disappeared without a trace.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo as well.</p><br/><p>Kuududududk</p><br/><p>Hansoo, who had been stuck inside the metal wall with only his head sticking out, frowned at the tremendous pressure pushing onto his body.</p><br/><p>\u2018Beyond my expectations. For one\u2019s ability to control it to rise so dramatically if they gave up their physical bodies.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s body which had been enhanced through the Dragon Essence Blade and Body Enhancement Surgery couldn\u2019t budge a bit.</p><br/><p>He felt like Sun Wukong being imprisoned under a mountain.</p><br/><p>A power Hansoo could not have since he needed to go to the next world and was only going to borrow a part of the power.</p><br/><p>\u2018But\u2026I can still do it.\u2019</p><br/><p>If he used his Racial Metamorphosis then he could probably fight against him.</p><br/><p>As Hansoo was about to prepare.</p><br/><p>Junghwan appeared in front of Hansoo\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>And the red crown was back on Junghwan\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>Junghwan laughed as he tapped the crown on his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways, I can\u2019t give you this crown anymore. It\u2019s mine now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jungwan looked at Hansoo as he felt the tremendous power running through his body.</p><br/><p>\u2018I guess it\u2019s something I gained because of you.\u2019</p><br/><p>Junghwan then looked at his right hand that had yet to heal.</p><br/><p>He had despised and hated when his hand had been cut off.</p><br/><p>If only the ones in front of his eyes had agreed to come with him.</p><br/><p>And if he could only figure out how he killed Dakidus.</p><br/><p>Then he would\u2019ve even been able to raise Metiron\u2019s forces who were hiding like mice in front of the Higher Races.</p><br/><p>But it was both good and bad.</p><br/><p>Since this strength was not something he would\u2019ve been able to gain if Hansoo hadn\u2019t activated the maze.</p><br/><p>Junghwan laughed coldly towards Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you but that\u2019s that. I\u2019ll treat this crown the price for my hand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Junghwan spoke towards Hansoo as he looked at his hand which he hadn\u2019t regenerated on purpose.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince I\u2019m going to be a bit busy now so\u2026Go now.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>Whooosh</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s body got sucked into the wall and started to disappear.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Rumble</p><br/><p>A conical area which was shaking as if there was an earthquake.</p><br/><p>Actually the ground itself was cracking apart as the land itself collapsing.</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>Whooosh</p><br/><p>A giant metal pillar appeared from in between the cracked ground.</p><br/><p>The 3m wide black metal pillar, which had crawled out from the ground like a worm, started to move a part of itself which looked like a mouth.</p><br/><p>And then.</p><br/><p>Phush!</p><br/><p>The metal pillar spat two things out.</p><br/><p>\u201cAaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>Two people popped out from the insides while screaming.</p><br/><p>Ekidu and Karhal caught their balance despite being in air as they landed upon the ground and looked around.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Outside?\u201d</p><br/><p>Karhal and Ekidu were confused.</p><br/><p>For Junghwan to let them go.</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>Phush!</p><br/><p>The metal pillar spat another thing out.</p><br/><p>And Karhal exclaimed out in joy.</p><br/><p>\u201cHansoo! You didn\u2019t die?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell. You kind of cut off that guy\u2019s hand. Don\u2019t look at me like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Karhal was shrugging his shoulders.</p><br/><p>Ratatatatat!</p><br/><p>The Metal pillar started to spit a large amount of things out.</p><br/><p>Like a machine gun.</p><br/><p>Papapapapapa!</p><br/><p>Karhal frowned as he saw this.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Runes?\u201d</p><br/><p>A tremendous amount of runes poured out from the metal mouth.</p><br/><p>It was more than enough to fill up all three of them to the brim.</p><br/><p>\u2018Where did such an amount\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Karhal pondered for a moment and then figured out where those runs came out from.</p><br/><p>The countless beasts that were inside the maze.</p><br/><p>The moment the maze twisted and changed form they had been crushed and the runes came from there.</p><br/><p>After a long while of spitting the runes out, the metal mouth chewed a bit and then spat something out again.</p><br/><p>Phuush!</p><br/><p>The thing that came out from the mouth got stuck onto the ground.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo frowned as he looked at the 3m long spear.</p><br/><p>\u2018Akion and Akitrus\u2019s Armor, the Heavenly Wrath Armor.\u2019</p><br/><p>But it was different from before.</p><br/><p>Kiiiiing</p><br/><p>The Akion, which couldn\u2019t be used from the severed connection from the Satellite Fortress, suddenly lighted up in bright blue on the tip.</p><br/><p>Proof that there was a clear supply of energy.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo knew where this energy came from.</p><br/><p>The Maze moved with the Mana Crystals as well.</p><br/><p>Junghwan had connected the Akion onto the core of the Maze.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well. It\u2019s not the maze anymore.\u2019</p><br/><p>The moment Hansoo picked up the Akion.</p><br/><p>Rumble</p><br/><p>The land that was already unstable started to tremble aggressively.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u2018That\u2026Should be enough for what you\u2019re trying to do right? Work hard.\u2019</p><br/><p>Junghwan laughed as he poured everything he had onto Hansoo.</p><br/><p>He had gained power.</p><br/><p>And he had even thrown away his body in order to use it properly.</p><br/><p>Since he knew that he wouldn\u2019t be completely free due to the symbol.</p><br/><p>And he had gotten completely unrestrained by the clan\u2019s symbol the moment he left his physical body.</p><br/><p>But clan\u2019s suppression was lifted as his goals of the past started to fill up his head.</p><br/><p>But at the same time he felt his soul burning up and his consciousness fading.</p><br/><p>He could only.</p><br/><p>Since the Maze was too large and powerful to be controlled by the consciousness of a human.</p><br/><p>But it didn\u2019t matter.</p><br/><p>Since he was prepared for it from the beginning.</p><br/><p>Junghwan thought of Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t like you but\u2026I hope you succeed. So you should hope that I succeed as well.\u2019</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>Rumble</p><br/><p>The tremendous metal structure moved back and forth.</p><br/><p>The insides fused, twisted and turned.</p><br/><p>And Junghwan mumbled as he felt this change.</p><br/><p>\u2018Be reborn.\u2019</p><br/><p>Into the existence he feared the most.</p><br/><p>Crackle</p><br/><p>Soon the black metal egg started to crack as it opened.</p><br/><p>And then.</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>A tremendous hand appeared between the cracks.</p><br/><p>With claws that seemed like it could slice mountains and cover the clouds, it appeared while causing a tremendous tremor in the surrounding area.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Humanity was a very lucky race if you take into account what happened to Erviang\u2019s race, who were space-time travelers.</p><br/><p>Hansoo shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s not time to get emotional.\u2019</p><br/><p>This was just a fake which copied the Red Zone.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t even have half of the dangers.</p><br/><p>\u2018Shall I go.\u2019</p><br/><p>This guy will probably be stuck at .</p><br/><p>He just needed to end him there.</p><br/><p>Hansoo continued his steps through the flaming landscape.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone who was advancing faithfully under the orders of Wongyung swirled their tongues around.</p><br/><p>Everything in their surroundings was burning.</p><br/><p>The strange-looking buildings which belonged to some other race were blazing and numerous beasts were moving between the buildings without end.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn\u2026 all of the area on the third floor shouldn\u2019t be like this right?\u2019</p><br/><p>That was not even reasonable.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t to the point where they were getting burned to death but the non-stop heat kept attacking their throats and lungs.</p><br/><p>And the beasts that charged at them were so strong that even his clansmen were barely blocking them.</p><br/><p>Due to the whole environment burning there wasn\u2019t any water to drink either.</p><br/><p>One of two things will happen at this rate.</p><br/><p>Either die from the beasts or die from dehydration.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026The world outside the tutorial is always like this?\u2019</p><br/><p>The fairy had told them.</p><br/><p>That the third floor was like a glimpse of the world outside of the tutorial.</p><br/><p>And added something else too.</p><br/><p>At first he was really relieved.</p><br/><p>Since even he wasn\u2019t comfortable with the fairy who brought evil rules endlessly.</p><br/><p>But he was slowly realizing something.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026It\u2019s not like it\u2019s not interfering but more like it doesn\u2019t need to interfere?\u2019</p><br/><p>If it was such a harsh environment to the point where they didn\u2019t need to interfere then they simply wouldn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>Since they will die by themselves.</p><br/><p>Wongyung, who had been advancing through the dried up landscape, shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u2018There\u2019s no way.\u2019</p><br/><p>There was no way that they would leave them all to die.</p><br/><p>Wongyung was confident.</p><br/><p>The strongest power in all of the Tower was him.</p><br/><p>If a power like his was suffering this much then all of the others might just die out.</p><br/><p>There was no way that they would\u2019ve set the difficulty so.</p><br/><p>Kudududuk</p><br/><p>\u2018First advance forward.\u2019</p><br/><p>Wongyung solidified his thoughts as he advanced.</p><br/><p>And soon a giant Cross appeared in his view.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it pretty?\u201d</p><br/><p>The fairy, which had appeared without anyone noticing, babbled.</p><br/><p>Wongyung slightly frowned at those words.</p><br/><p>It was a disgusting-looking cross even at a single glance.</p><br/><p>And on that cross, human faces were coming out and going back into it non-stop.</p><br/><p>Like people who were trapped within a giant cloth.</p><br/><p>And then Wongyung rubbed his eyes after seeing an extremely familiar face.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026.Huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>The fairy smiled as it spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you see some familiar faces?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wongyung ignored the fairy\u2019s words as he inspected the cross after walking closer to it.</p><br/><p>And then made a expression of fear.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this cross\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm\u2026 I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re thinking about but shall we say it\u2019s right? Heehee. Correct! All the information of those who died in the tutorial are in there! Oh my. Two were just added.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wongyung slightly closed the gaps of his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut what is the meaning of this?\u201d</p><br/><p>He knew that it was definitely disgusting.</p><br/><p>But what did this mean to them.</p><br/><p>\u201cReflect our actions while looking at the dead?\u201d</p><br/><p>The fairy shook its head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe cross will look very very pretty after you hear my words.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is the Cross of Reincarnation! You can revive someone of those who participated in the tutorial who had died!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wongyung made a expression of fright.</p><br/><p>They did look like beings close to gods.</p><br/><p>But for them to be able to effect those who had already died.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this nonsense\u2026 Can you guys even control the dead?\u201d</p><br/><p>The fairy smirked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a bit too hard at our level. It\u2019s just a copy that we brought on the way here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 a copy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. We made a copy of all of you when you came here and saved it within that cross. And that cross uses that as the base to create a copy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>While Wongyung\u2019s eyes were flickering the fairy made a smile as if it knew that would happen and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThough it\u2019s a copy, their strength and memory will be the same as the real one before they came to this side. Woudln\u2019t this be amazing if it\u2019s a loved one? Heeheehee.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can revive the dead?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wongyung\u2019s hands trembled.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026Really?\u2019</p><br/><p>Wongyung\u2019s memories rewinded at an extreme speed.</p><br/><p>The reason why he had came to despise other Lords.</p><br/><p>This was all because of that guy he had met in the start.</p><br/><p>Actually there was somebody else who had manifested the power of a Lord before Wongyung in the 1st tutorial area.</p><br/><p>And that guy had taken control of his daugher with the symbol and played around with her then killed her by using her as a shield during a dangerous moment.</p><br/><p>How much he had despaired over this.</p><br/><p>He had created a much bigger power after he had manifested his power as a Lord.</p><br/><p>Since his psychic power was much greater than that guy\u2019s.</p><br/><p>And he thought after ripping that guy to shreds.</p><br/><p>That the reason why he was given this psychic power was a sign from the heavens to rip apart all those other Lords.</p><br/><p>And one more thing.</p><br/><p>He needed a lot of strength.</p><br/><p>Why?</p><br/><p>He needed much more strength than he has now in order to find him.</p><br/><p>Since his son would be much further ahead than him if he was alive.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t catch up the 5-year gap to his son with some average amount of power.</p><br/><p>He basically needed strength to plow through and advance forward.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t matter to him if his actions were something that would cause him to get cursed by others.</p><br/><p>Since the ones who curse him aren\u2019t the ones who would find his son for him.</p><br/><p>Everything was playing out very well.</p><br/><p>But for such a thing to happen to him!</p><br/><p>Wongyung touched the cross with trembling hands.</p><br/><p>As soon as his hands touched it, thousands of people who had died in the tutorial appeared in front of his eyes.</p><br/><p>And many of those who had died by his clans existed as well.</p><br/><p>But that didn\u2019t matter.</p><br/><p>Since his only interest was his daughter.</p><br/><p>While he was flipping through the catalogue, his daughter Ahee came into his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh\u2026ahhhhh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wongyung shed tears of joy.</p><br/><p>He could revive Ahee!</p><br/><p>Without any memories of pain, with the body and memory before she had come here!</p><br/><p>Though her body would be weak, that did not matter.</p><br/><p>He just needed to protect her.</p><br/><p>\u2018Thank you. God. Thank you.\u2019</p><br/><p>Wongyung asked the fairy in a hurry.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can I revive them?\u201d</p><br/><p>The fairy smirked as it spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cSimple. Just put someone in here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fairy pointed towards the bottom of the giant cross.</p><br/><p>A deep hole that looked like a grave.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou need ingredients in order to make something new. Put someone else in for the person coming out. It\u2019s pretty simple that way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wongyung hurriedly looked around.</p><br/><p>He just needed to put the weakest one in.</p><br/><p>Then there will be no problems.</p><br/><p>At his orders, a guy who had been panting from an injury slowly dragged his body and walked towards the hole beneath the cross.</p><br/><p>While Wongyung was rejoicing at that sight, sounds of the fairy clicking its tongue were heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cNono. Can\u2019t do that. You can\u2019t do that. You can\u2019t use a clansman. It becomes too easy then. We didn\u2019t want to see something like that. You can\u2019t use tricks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!!!! What do you want!!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wongyung screamed out unknowningly.</p><br/><p>The fairy smiled coyly as it spoke:</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that hard. You just need to put someone else who isn\u2019t part of your clan in here. Then your daughter lives too. How good is it? Hehehehee. It\u2019s really chaotic in other places about now but it\u2019s a problem here because it\u2019s all one clan. Ah. Another one added to the cross.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wongyung despaired at these words.</p><br/><p>How would he find somebody in his deserted land.</p><br/><p>Wongyung asked the fairy just in case.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn\u2026 Is there another chance like this in the future?\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t believe that only they will be on the path from now on.</p><br/><p>If they meet others then they could just catch them then revive Ahee after inserting them into the Cross they will find later.</p><br/><p>The fairy shook its head.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. This is the end of the privilege. Chances don\u2019t come that easily right? As we see it, it\u2019s not fun when people have leisure. You need to be a bit of a crisis. If you leave after visiting this place once then you can\u2019t use it again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGoddaaamitttt!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wongyung spat out a scream of despair.</p><br/><p>They were already behind because they had to gather all their clansmen who were spread all around.</p><br/><p>The people who had started off were probably going through some other path somewhere else.</p><br/><p>And what would a person with some basic sense think when they see the view of the third floor.</p><br/><p>Would they go around some roundabout way and group up with other people in some other starting point?</p><br/><p>Or would they think to go through his hell-like place by themselves.</p><br/><p>And they couldn\u2019t wait forever in this place.</p><br/><p>Since they couldn\u2019t get anything to eat or drink in these blazing plains.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t send out his clansmen when he didn\u2019t know what could happen from now on.</p><br/><p>But then Wongyung\u2019s expression turned cold.</p><br/><p>\u2018Maybe.\u2019</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know what was ahead but he had somewhat organized on the way here from the starting point.</p><br/><p>If he send some clansmen to wait in the starting point then some random guys might pop out.</p><br/><p>And then he just needed to catch them before they went into other paths.</p><br/><p>At that moment one of his clansmen shouted loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cLord! Somebody is coming this way over there!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wongyung opened his eyes wide and looked towards the starting point.</p><br/><p>And he could see a person walking towards them from the starting point.</p><br/><p>\u2018How could this be. Thank you. Oh god.\u2019</p><br/><p>Wongyung, who wasn\u2019t even religious, prayed to god.</p><br/><p>No, there was no way such a thing would happen if there was no god.</p><br/><p>God had given him the power to find his son and a chance to revive his daughter.</p><br/><p>If god isn\u2019t looking after him then what was this?</p><br/><p>Soon Wongyung\u2019s mind which was filled with glee calmed down.</p><br/><p>That guy couldn\u2019t run away after seeing this place.</p><br/><p>Definitely not.</p><br/><p>He had to catch him no matter what and throw him under the grave.</p><br/><p>Since that was the only way to save his daughter.</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know who you are\u2026 but thank you.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cCatch him!\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as his order came down, his clansmen charged towards the man walking towards them from afar.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>Hansoo quietly mumbled inwardly as he looked at the people charging at him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Dark Mad Lord. First rate Dark Lord.\u2019</p><br/><p>The sins he had caused were too many to list.</p><br/><p>Of cause this was all a thing of the past.</p><br/><p>His situation? He knew too well.</p><br/><p>Since he had heard all of his screams of despair before he died.</p><br/><p>He knew why he hated Lords, why he tried to increase his strength crazily and how he had become a first rate Dark Lord.</p><br/><p>He had to leave behind his daughter here because he couldn\u2019t find some other non-clansman here.</p><br/><p>And he, who had been enraged by this, caused a massacre in the tutorial due to the urgent thoughts of him having to find his one remaining son.</p><br/><p>He had done so until now but in greater amounts from this point onwards.</p><br/><p>And he had caught up the gap of 5 years but went crazy after finding out that his son had died and then flipped the Otherworld upside down.</p><br/><p>As if he was trying to relieve the rage against the world which had killed his son and daughter by venting it on the inhabitants of the world.</p><br/><p>His circumstances were regrettable but it could not excuse him for the things he had done so far.</p><br/><p>\u2018But you won\u2019t feel unfair from this. Since you will get to revive your daughter if you win here.\u2019</p><br/><p>He had come to the Dark Mad Lord and the Dark Mad Lord had come to kill him.</p><br/><p>It wouldn\u2019t be bad for him.</p><br/><p>Since if the Dark Mad Lord won in this fight, he would be able to use him as a sacrifice to revive his daughter.</p><br/><p>That was all he needed.</p><br/><p>And soon his Justice and Judgement of Dekrados exploded out with his body as the center.</p><br/><p>Proofreader\u2019s note</p><br/><p>There are multiple Crosses in the third floor. That\u2019s why even though Hansoo knew that Wongyung would be at a Cross, he still had to follow his clansmen to find him in a short time.</p><br/><p>This is a sponsored chapter, the second of the week.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

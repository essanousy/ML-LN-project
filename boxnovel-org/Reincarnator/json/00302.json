Very good.\u2019</p><br/><p>2 years.</p><br/><p>It was not a long period of time.</p><br/><p>But in order to get stronger and throw everything away to achieve that, it was more than enough time.</p><br/><p>Even more so if that person was already powerful or had a lot of potential.</p><br/><p>The Abyss was a place best suited for people like that.</p><br/><p>A world made to create monsters.</p><br/><p>He had been worried that there might only be weaklings because they were fighting with each other but it seemed there was a person who had reached the ceiling already.</p><br/><p>\u2018I should go find that person.\u2019</p><br/><p>It seemed like it would be hard to find the person but thankfully they had kindly left behind a clue.</p><br/><p>As if the person wanted to talk to himself.</p><br/><p>He chased after the invitation letter that the person had left behind.</p><br/><p>The four who had taken his invitation to be exact.</p><br/><p>And there was only a single emotion inside him.</p><br/><p>Curiosity.</p><br/><p>The 2 years during which he had been isolated.</p><br/><p>How had the world changed?</p><br/><p>When the Abyss fell down upon them in the past, the Otherworld and the Abyss had both completely broken down.</p><br/><p>But thanks to him controlling the amount of information he let out, the Otherworld hadn\u2019t completely broken down this time.</p><br/><p>Which meant that the people had a bit of buffer.</p><br/><p>Thought he difficulty would\u2019ve been much higher than in the past, the humans had become unbelievably stronger than they had been in the past.</p><br/><p>Since he had set up the Red, Orange and Yellow zones in such a way that they would constantly create powerful soldiers.</p><br/><p>The danger rose and the humans grew stronger.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo could only guess, he couldn\u2019t know for sure how this world had changed.</p><br/><p>Since there were too many variables for anyone to predict the future accurately.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, time to check.\u2019</p><br/><p>As Hansoo was about to continue after the footprints after he had looked at the steel elevator in the distance.</p><br/><p>Rumble.</p><br/><p>From the distance.</p><br/><p>Hansoo felt something within this senses that had spread far and wide.</p><br/><p>And the moment he sensed this.</p><br/><p>Hansoo frowned.</p><br/><p>\u2018How fast.\u2019</p><br/><p>He was feeling it more and more.</p><br/><p>If the humans were alive then there should be some form of signal in the sky, like a flare or something.</p><br/><p>No, there should at least be a trace.</p><br/><p>But even after so long, there was only a vast plain.</p><br/><p>As if everything had died.</p><br/><p>Which meant one thing.</p><br/><p>\u2018They\u2019ve been pushed back huh.\u2019</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know what was going on in the other places.</p><br/><p>Since once the elevators descended, the worlds would get shredded apart.</p><br/><p>The elevators were a supernatural structure that separated the worlds into different floors.</p><br/><p>The different floors would become completely separated and house a society and a world of their own.</p><br/><p>But one thing was clear regarding the 1st floor of the the Green Zone.</p><br/><p>The humans weren\u2019t the only owners of this place.</p><br/><p>Squirm.</p><br/><p>Hansoo felt something in the edges of his field of perception.</p><br/><p>Something that he couldn\u2019t fully make out despite his greatly improved senses.</p><br/><p>He could only sense that something was approaching him.</p><br/><p>But if the ground was shaking this much despite him not being able to sense it\u2026 It only meant one thing.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s a race that is self-ruled*. Right from the get-go\u2026 I guess they really got pushed back far.\u2019</p><br/><p>(TN: Self-Ruled : I translated this literally because I couldn\u2019t think of a better wording. Basically these guys don\u2019t have a set hierarchy and have a community of equals with no true leader.)</p><br/><p>The races that were self-ruled were hard to deal with unless one knew how to deal with each different kind properly.</p><br/><p>But on the other hand, their weakness was known then it was much easier to deal with than a race with a normal hierarchy.</p><br/><p>This was why information was the most valuable thing to humans, this was why the first thing Hansoo had told the adventurers was the method to deal with these self-ruled races.</p><br/><p>It shouldn\u2019t be hard to deal with them but from seeing these things being everywhere and going after the adventurers\u2026 It meant that the humans had been pushed back really far.</p><br/><p>\u2018What the hell caused all of this?\u2019</p><br/><p>He had given them specific orders to deal with this but it seemed something unexpected had happened.</p><br/><p>These self-ruled race types were almost impossible to detect or sense.</p><br/><p>They could only check with their eyes.</p><br/><p>And he couldn\u2019t just leave before seeing it with his own eyes.</p><br/><p>Since some of them would chase after people in order to kill them even if it took an eternity to do so.</p><br/><p>If someone didn\u2019t want to deal with an entire race because they escaped from one member, then they would need to deal with them properly in the first place.</p><br/><p>Rumble.</p><br/><p>Squirm.</p><br/><p>Hansoo finally could see what the creature was as it approached him.</p><br/><p>Shshshshshsh.</p><br/><p>Past the snow covered plains.</p><br/><p>And sometimes through the blizzard.</p><br/><p>A 2 dimensional being approaching like a shadow.</p><br/><p>\u2018Dakramas.\u2019</p><br/><p>Creatures that hid between the dimensions and hunted other race by assimilating them into their own dimension.</p><br/><p>They hid if they were being attacked.</p><br/><p>If the enemy escaped then they would come out to attack or drag them into their own dimension.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo was disappointed.</p><br/><p>\u2018They got pushed back by these guys?\u2019</p><br/><p>Of course they were indeed a hassle to deal with.</p><br/><p>But there was a clear cut method to deal with them.</p><br/><p>The Rebanol Scales that one could acquire after killing the common hierarchy race Rebanols.</p><br/><p>Weapons applied with ground scales of Rebanols, a race that evolved to hunt Dakramas, could easily penetrate through the pocket dimensions they were hiding in.</p><br/><p>They were easy pickings after that, a few stabs and they were easily dealt with.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t the only method.</p><br/><p>The Beynol race, the race that the Dakramas predated on.</p><br/><p>If the scent sacs underneath their wings were taken and lit on fire, a red light would explode out that would cause the senses of the Dakramas to become greatly hindered.</p><br/><p>A defensive mechanism the Beynol race had developed.</p><br/><p>But there was no way for Hansoo, who had just woken up, to get the Rebanol Scales or the scent sacs of the Beynols.</p><br/><p>\u2018They\u2019re really swarming this place. I guess I\u2019ll just deal with them here\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t impossible.</p><br/><p>Just annoying.</p><br/><p>Crunch.</p><br/><p>As Hansoo poured his strength into the Forked Lightning.</p><br/><p>Piiiing!</p><br/><p>In the distance.</p><br/><p>Something flew towards him attached to an arrow.</p><br/><p>\u2018...That?\u2019</p><br/><p>As Hansoo frowned at the red capsule on the tip of the arrow.</p><br/><p>A powerful red light exploded out from the sudden red light.</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>The moment the surrounding shadows got swept by the red light.</p><br/><p>Shhhhhhhhhk!</p><br/><p>Shaaaaak!</p><br/><p>The shadows that were quickly approaching them seemed to have been extremely shocked as they started to jump around in multiple directions.</p><br/><p>Like their five senses had been disturbed.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo knew what caused this light.</p><br/><p>\u2018Beynol\u2019s Powder.\u2019</p><br/><p>As Hansoo turned his head towards where the arrow had come from.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Run!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGod! I told you we should just leave him alone! You crazy bastard of a captain!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the distance.</p><br/><p>He could see the two males and two females shouting at him.</p><br/><p>\u2018The ones I was chasing\u2026 Why are they here?\u2019</p><br/><p>According to his calculations, they should be much further ahead and even if they did remain behind due to something, there was no reason for them to save him.</p><br/><p>The Beynol\u2019s Powder was not a complete solution to the Dakramas, they might be killed as well.</p><br/><p>And as he expected.</p><br/><p>\u201cUaaa!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBastards! Just wait right there!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Dakramas who were a bit further away and had taken less of an impact from the red light started to charge towards Hansoo to deal with him first.</p><br/><p>And the group that shot the arrow started to quickly run away.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hmm. They should know that they could get swept into the fight.\u2019</p><br/><p>People who carried around the Beynol\u2019s Powders should definitely know this.</p><br/><p>The group who had started to run away looked at Hansoo for a bit and then quickly moved away.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>A few moments later.</p><br/><p>In a cave a bit away.</p><br/><p>The group of four people started to breathe roughly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaaa\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck! Crazy maniac! Are you a superhero or something? Don\u2019t just go around saving anybody!\u201d</p><br/><p>The girl named Misun shouted towards the man named Taesang.</p><br/><p>And in the distance.</p><br/><p>Tatatak.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Anybody? Feisty huh.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo chuckled at the words of the girl inside the cave.</p><br/><p>It was quite a funny sight to behold after just coming out from a situation where they could\u2019ve died.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo didn\u2019t laugh at them.</p><br/><p>He knew that they were quite capable.</p><br/><p>\u2018Good ability. Good coping methods.\u2019</p><br/><p>Though they were screaming, they had made sure to block sounds from escaping as well as covering up where they were hiding.</p><br/><p>They were bickering only after they had created a safe hideout.</p><br/><p>A normal adventurer or some random monster wouldn\u2019t even know that these four would be inside this cave.</p><br/><p>And though they had saved him, they had erased all the traces on the way to the cave.</p><br/><p>\u2018They are wary of me huh.\u2019</p><br/><p>Though being wary was one thing, it seems they couldn\u2019t let see him die.</p><br/><p>Hansoo came to a decision.</p><br/><p>\u2018The box first.\u2019</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Whooosh.</p><br/><p>Hansoo quickly headed towards the four people within the cave.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

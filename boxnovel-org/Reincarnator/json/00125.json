Why is this woman not leaving until the end.\u2019</p><br/><p>The relationship between Hansoo and him had not been found out, at least not yet.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well. I do want to stay by his side too.\u2019</p><br/><p>Everyone else had run away.</p><br/><p>Sangjin was lost in thought as he looked at the falling skies in the distance.</p><br/><p>When he was young.</p><br/><p>He had always spent his time watching hero movies.</p><br/><p>And thought to himself.</p><br/><p>One day, he wanted to become somebody who shined light upon others.</p><br/><p>Even if nobody knew about it.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well. Isn\u2019t that cooler?\u2019</p><br/><p>Sangjin smiled.</p><br/><p>The world he used to live in, it would be impossible for such a thing to happen.</p><br/><p>Since such things wouldn\u2019t be possible for a cog.</p><br/><p>And since he was a cog that didn\u2019t even matter.</p><br/><p>While he was thinking of numerous things, something charged through the falling debris.</p><br/><p>A bright golden light.</p><br/><p>With a dark aura surrounding it.</p><br/><p>\u2018Woo. That\u2019s fucking cool no matter how many times I see it. I should get something like that when I get the chance. Violet is a bit tacky.\u2019</p><br/><p>Sangjin laughed at the charging golden line that was approaching him through the earth which was getting smashed apart.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know what Hansoo was running towards at the very beginning.</p><br/><p>But he thought that he now had a slight idea of what it was.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s amazing. Thank you.\u2019</p><br/><p>Sangjin smiled.</p><br/><p>While thinking that he had gotten on a very nice boat.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>Hududududuk</p><br/><p>\u201cUwaaaaa!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDodge it! Fall back! Get back deeper!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamnit! This much was still not safe!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Okonelly clan who were hidden deep within the buttocks of the Gragos freaked out.</p><br/><p>Since the ant tunnels they were in started to get ripped apart as a whole.</p><br/><p>Udududuk</p><br/><p>The dark ant tunnels collapsed as they disappeared.</p><br/><p>And Jichan almost fell down onto his knees from the sight that appeared in front of him.</p><br/><p>Kuuuuungg!</p><br/><p>Crunch Crunch</p><br/><p>The flesh of the Gragos where their ant tunnels were had been chewed off as a whole.</p><br/><p>And it was disappearing into the leopard\u2019s mouth which was easily few kilometers big.</p><br/><p>\u201cAaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUwwaaaa!\u201d</p><br/><p>The thousands of people who hadn\u2019t been able to escape from the Gragos\u2019s flesh started get sucked into the leopard\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>But these were all adventurers who roamed around the Otherworld.</p><br/><p>Everyone had a few tricks up their sleeves.</p><br/><p>They used numerous skills to fly or jumped in order to get onto the bull-shaped Gragos.</p><br/><p>Few pondered for a moment since the distance was too great and just jumped into the leopard instead.</p><br/><p>In order to just live upon the skin of the leopard.</p><br/><p>But in conclusion, both of these decisions weren\u2019t good ones.</p><br/><p>Kuuugugugung!</p><br/><p>The bull shaped Gragos couldn\u2019t handle it any longer as it raised its front legs and smashed the leopard.</p><br/><p>It had gotten angry after having a chunk of its buttock flesh getting chewed off.</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>The leopard, which had been hit by the bull, fell into the lava.</p><br/><p>The problem was after this.</p><br/><p>Splash</p><br/><p>A shockwave rang out with the location where the leopard fell as the center.</p><br/><p>The shock wave from the leopard created numerous splatters of lava which flew into the skies and assaulted the bodies of both the leopard and the bull.</p><br/><p>As well as the people above them.</p><br/><p>\u201cAaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>The people who were swept up by the lava only left behind echoes of screams as they disappeared into the Heringsen.</p><br/><p>And it wasn\u2019t much different for those who survived through it.</p><br/><p>No, it was actually worse for them.</p><br/><p>Chiiiiiiiiik</p><br/><p>\u201cUwaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>These people died as their whole bodies were burnt by the lava as they petrified along with the lava.</p><br/><p>Like those who couldn\u2019t escape the volcano\u2019s eruption in Pompeii.</p><br/><p>The people who had barely survived within the ant tunnels looked at this scene with dumbfounded expressions.</p><br/><p>Since they realized how small and insignificant they were.</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t even at the level of a parasite.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn. The area which we tried so hard to take over\u2026 Just got chomped up by that thing in a single go.</p><br/><p>The 2nd area for the dispute between the clans for the past 5 years, which was full of body fluids and was quite safe from the Baladis, had disappeared in an instant.</p><br/><p>Along with around 6 smaller clans who had taken over this area recently.</p><br/><p>\u2018Deeper! We need to get deeper!\u2019</p><br/><p>Jichan clenched his teeth as he started to run deeper.</p><br/><p>This place was dangerous.</p><br/><p>Since the leopard was preparing to pounce again.</p><br/><p>The moment Jichan prayed that the leopard bit onto another location as he started to run.</p><br/><p>Something came into Jichan\u2019s view.</p><br/><p>Hoooook</p><br/><p>Something was charging towards him at extreme speeds while shining with a gold light.</p><br/><p>\u2018Uh? Uhhh?\u2019</p><br/><p>Jichan unconsciously took a step back from the oppressive aura.</p><br/><p>And then a chill ran down his back from that aura.</p><br/><p>Jichan turned around instinctively in order to search for a location to run away to.</p><br/><p>A cliff was behind him.</p><br/><p>Though there wasn\u2019t anywhere to run, the aura of the golden thing was vicious enough to make him forget that.</p><br/><p>But Jichan regretted looking behind him.</p><br/><p>Since he saw the leopard opening its mouth widely towards the area where he was standing at.</p><br/><p>Kuaaaang!</p><br/><p>The bull raised its hind legs in order to kick away the leopard.</p><br/><p>The ant tunnels started to vibrate intensely as if an earthquake occurred.</p><br/><p>Whoosh</p><br/><p>Jichan lost his balance while going back and forth between the golden existence and the leopard as he got flung out from the vibration.</p><br/><p>Jichan fell as he made a dejected expression.</p><br/><p>The most prominent memories ran by his head while he was falling towards the Heringsen.</p><br/><p>He had fought the people charging towards him desperately and killed them.</p><br/><p>He had fought battles in order to gain the lacking body fluids.</p><br/><p>Since he didn\u2019t want to die and the environment was too harsh for him to not be selfish.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026Damn. I wanted to find my father.\u2019</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>He felt his body being lifted up.</p><br/><p>Though his body was already in air, he felt something lifting up his body.</p><br/><p>A single voice was heard in Jichan\u2019s ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Whoosh</p><br/><p>Jichan had been flung back into the ant tunnels</p><br/><p>Kwadududuk</p><br/><p>Jichan caught his balance and desperately grasped the walls of the ant tunnels.</p><br/><p>Since the sensation of the fall was still running through him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuuuk\u2026Huuk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jichan caught his breath as he got suspicious of his own eyes at the person who had flung him.</p><br/><p>The golden line, which had thrown him, was flying towards the mouth of the leopard in the distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cInsane\u2026Hey! What are you doing! Where are you going man!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jichan hurriedly shouted but the golden line had long disappeared into the mouth of the leopard.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>Hansoo landed on top of the leopard\u2019s teeth as he plunged his hands into the white teeth and stabilized himself.</p><br/><p>Though it was a very sturdy teeth that could easily chew up the flesh of the giant Gragos but it was smashed apart like tofu in front of Hansoo\u2019s strength.</p><br/><p>Koooong</p><br/><p>Hansoo repositioned himself as he looked around.</p><br/><p>The whole world was in chaos.</p><br/><p>Lava was clashing from all around as numerous debris that fell from the Gragos rained down while ablaze.</p><br/><p>And they constantly smashed onto this body.</p><br/><p>The extremely hot lava rain, which had killed hundreds of people, smashed onto his body but he withstood it.</p><br/><p>Tudodododong</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s nice.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded at the strength of the completely filled up runes.</p><br/><p>The difference between 20% and 100% was like heaven and earth.</p><br/><p>Power was overflowing from every part of his body.</p><br/><p>The mana, which he always lacked, made the thickness of the Demonic Dragon\u2019s Reinforcement like a castle\u2019s walls.</p><br/><p>He felt invincible no matter who he went up against.</p><br/><p>Except the problem was that humans weren\u2019t his opponents.</p><br/><p>Chiiiiik</p><br/><p>The strengthened Demonic Dragon\u2019s Reinforcement blocked off the heat from the lava.</p><br/><p>The Thousand Soldiers Armor seemed like it was proving to be the best armor in the world as it kept its shape despite the countless debris smashing into it.</p><br/><p>But he had to withstand the projectiles of lava with his own strength.</p><br/><p>Kudududuk</p><br/><p>\u2018Hoook. Hook.\u2019</p><br/><p>The leopard\u2019s mouth was constantly moving in order to chew up the bull.</p><br/><p>Due to this the rocky skin of the Gragos and the lava was swirling around its mouth constantly.</p><br/><p>A force which would\u2019ve easily turned him flat smashed onto Hansoo\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Roaaarrr!</p><br/><p>He felt like a small fly being blended up with numerous other things within a giant blender.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo wasn\u2019t flung off as he intensely clenched onto his teeth, smashed his legs into the teeth and climbed up towards the top of its mouth.</p><br/><p>\u2018If I didn\u2019t receive the Body Enhancement Surgery then I would\u2019ve been flung off numerous times huh.\u2019</p><br/><p>Thunk. Kuthunk.</p><br/><p>The three hearts ruthlessly pumped blood throughout his whole body.</p><br/><p>The golden scales and the black mana melted and deflected off the flying debris.</p><br/><p>Hansoo withstood the storm as he went past its mouth and headed towards its nose.</p><br/><p>Hooooong</p><br/><p>\u201cHoooh.\u201d</p><br/><p>The vibration was still the same within the nose but he could at least dodge the storm of lava.</p><br/><p>\u2018I wonder if this is what the adventurers feel after dodging a giant storm.</p><br/><p>Well his situation was a bit worse since one\u2019s legs and arms wouldn\u2019t get broken from getting hit by a bit of rain.</p><br/><p>Hansoo caught his breath as he looked at his broken right arm and left leg.</p><br/><p>A result of him deflecting a flying debris.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hu-up!\u2019</p><br/><p>Kududuk</p><br/><p>Hansoo used a bit of strength and fixed the position of the broken arm and leg.</p><br/><p>Then the silvery liquid started to madly fill up the broken location.</p><br/><p>Hansoo got up after his legs and arms healed to the point where he could move them.</p><br/><p>\u2018No time to rest.\u2019</p><br/><p>Chiiiiik</p><br/><p>Hansoo flung off the lava burning on his body as he cut through the humidity that was coming off from all around as he headed deep into the leopard\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Suuuuuk</p><br/><p>Hansoo, who had been running through the nose where its breath was storming like a hurricane, touched the surface of the wall.</p><br/><p>The inner flesh and turned completely black.</p><br/><p>Calamity of Death.</p><br/><p>All the Akarons thought of this disease as the side effect of creating the Body Enhancement Surgery.</p><br/><p>But he knew.</p><br/><p>Since he had read Elkadion\u2019s memory crystal.</p><br/><p>He knew why the Calamity of Death had appeared.</p><br/><p>\u2018Elkadion\u2026 An Akaron who roamed the Abyss in order to atone for his sins.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo ran through the already dead inner parts of the Gragos.</p><br/><p>Through the hole devoid of Baladis and parasites, that only had huge vibrations and sounds rushing through.</p><br/><p>His goal was seen after a long run.</p><br/><p>\u2018Found it, It\u2019s as it was written down.\u2019</p><br/><p>Soul Telautograph.</p><br/><p>The capsule shaped object on the insides of the Gragos where nothing else existed looked a bit different from what Gwanje saw.</p><br/><p>Since it was still working very well.</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>Hansoo blocked a powerful blow and then smashed the thing which had attacked him.</p><br/><p>Kyaaaaak!</p><br/><p>\u2018You came out.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo muttered as he looked at the Tiradus which he had turned more than halfway black with a single attack.</p><br/><p>The final obstacle.</p><br/><p>And a guardian created in order to defend the .</p><br/><p>Hansoo started to think of the things written down in Elkadion\u2019s memory crystal.</p><br/><p>Proofreader\u2019s note</p><br/><p>Weekly bonus chapter 3/3.</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s a MAN!</p><br/><p>For next week\u2019s 3 bonus chapters, we\u2019ve decided to publish them if the Wikia is filled up a bit: One bonus chapter for writing the pages for the \u201cPast characters\u201d, and two bonus chapters for the \u201cTutorial characters\u201d.</p><br/><p>If 1/100th of the readers do one character each, there\u2019ll be at least six chapters next week!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

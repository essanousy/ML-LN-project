Is the Orange Zone completed for now then?\u2019</p><br/><p>The Orange Zone is basically over once the process of achieving the Crown to control the Akadus has been completed.</p><br/><p>Since healing Lazar and the other Gragos would be a piece of cake with the Crown of Thorns in his hands.</p><br/><p>He would just need to get the Akadus to kill the black Tiradus inside the Gragos and just insert the cure like that.</p><br/><p>Taruhol sat upon the Soul Telautograph.</p><br/><p>And then he placed the Crown onto his head with a joyous expression.</p><br/><p>\u2018With this\u2026We will be another step closer towards the recovery of the Akarons.\u2019</p><br/><p>The moment Taruhol placed the Crown onto his head a change occurred</p><br/><p>Chwaarurururuk</p><br/><p>The thorns on the Crown of Thorns extended out explosively.</p><br/><p>The hundreds of thorns pierced into the head of the Taruhol which it was sitting on.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhuk\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Taruhol\u2019s skin, which had the strength of a Margoth-level person, couldn\u2019t handle the thorns as the thorns pierced straight through.</p><br/><p>A tremendous amount of pain.</p><br/><p>But Taruhol clenched onto his teeth and held on.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is nothing\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>At the same time the Soul Telautograph Taruhol was sitting on started to react.</p><br/><p>Kwaaaaaa!</p><br/><p>Something came out from the bodies of the dead Akarons and got sucked into the Soul Telautograph.</p><br/><p>One by one.</p><br/><p>Kiiiing</p><br/><p>The Soul Telautograph acted up and vibrated with a strange noise and the black Crown of Thorns upon Taruhol\u2019s head started to slowly turn red.</p><br/><p>Hansoo saw this as he frowned.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026I haven\u2019t heard of a stage like that. Do we need to take more caution about this?\u2019</p><br/><p>Such things weren\u2019t written down in Elkadion\u2019s memory crystal.</p><br/><p>When Hansoo was pondering whether to stop the process or not.</p><br/><p>A huge noise was heard from the tunnel Hansoo was standing in.</p><br/><p>Kwaaaaaaa!</p><br/><p>\u2018Crap, already?\u2019</p><br/><p>The golden Akadus who had already handled the humans were charging as 10 golden rays.</p><br/><p>It seems like 2 had been smashed apart while fighting the humans but 10 was still a formidable number.</p><br/><p>Hansoo held tightly onto his spear and blocked their path.</p><br/><p>And then smashed them as they flew into him.</p><br/><p>Boooooooom!</p><br/><p>All ten golden rays suddenly turned their ways and charged at Hansoo from the huge shockwave.</p><br/><p>Hansoo pulled up all the mana within his body and started to fight them.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tsk, there was nothing to ponder about.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo mumbled from the force that had smashed onto his side and was penetrating through the scales.</p><br/><p>If they couldn\u2019t use the Crown then they would die by the Akadus anyway.</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s right arm was deflected up from the attacks of 3 Akadus.</p><br/><p>A completely defenseless state.</p><br/><p>2 of the Akadus took advantage of the situation and charged towards Hansoo in order to smash apart his heart and intestines.</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>Kirurururk</p><br/><p>All the silver Akadus that were causing a massacre from all around suddenly stopped.</p><br/><p>At the time the 10 golden Akadus which had been assaulting Hansoo all stopped and fell down from the skies like powerless moths.</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded as he saw this.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s done.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo mumbled as he looked at Taruhol who was standing up from his seat with a posture of a king with the completely red Crown of Thorns upon his head.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Taruhol\u2019s body shook from the countless amounts of information that flew into his head.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026This is why Hansoo told me that the Akaron with the most powerful body was needed.\u2019</p><br/><p>Information from hundreds of thousands of Akadus.</p><br/><p>And the energy that needed to give various commands and orders to these.</p><br/><p>There was a tremendous amount of stress upon his body and his brain.</p><br/><p>At this command all the Akadus returned to the place they had come out from.</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked at Taruhol and asked him as Taruhol approached him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p><br/><p>Taruhol laughed as he replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing. It really feels like I\u2019ve become a king. By the way there\u2019s something I want to talk about the contract\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo started to prepare for an emergency situation just in case from Taruhol\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>There was one thing about the contract between him and the Akarons.</p><br/><p>Hansoo would give them the Crown of Thorns.</p><br/><p>And the Akarons would provide humans the Body Enhancement Surgery.</p><br/><p>And he would place a soul fragment onto the person with the Crown of Thorns as a safety measure.</p><br/><p>The Akaron with the soul fragment wouldn\u2019t side with the Akarons or the Humans and instead act as a mediator between the two.</p><br/><p>Like Elkadion who wanted to stop all aggression with absolute strength.</p><br/><p>But thoughts could always change.</p><br/><p>No, that God made living creatures this way from the start.</p><br/><p>The Taruhol before and after attaining the Crown of Thorns could have different thoughts.</p><br/><p>And the final scene that wasn\u2019t in the memory crystal kept on bugging him.</p><br/><p>\u2018If he were to break the contract\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>But unlike Hansoo\u2019s thoughts, Taruhol simply laughed as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry and plant that soul fragment onto my head. It\u2019s finally time for me to pay you back. Anyways, you aren\u2019t gonna make me do anything weird right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo loosened up from Taruhol\u2019s joke and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, there wouldn\u2019t really be a need for me to meddle in much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo pulled out a small Soul Fragment from his head and then shoved it into Taruhol\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Chwarararak</p><br/><p>Taruhol made an uncomfortable expression from the sensation of the Soul Fragment going into his body.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s not really the greatest feeling in the world huh.\u2019</p><br/><p>But if the Akarons and Humans could coexist with this then Taruhol was content with that.</p><br/><p>Since there wouldn\u2019t be a need to fight anymore.</p><br/><p>The Margoths would now get blown away by the Akarons as if they were leaves and once they heal the other Gragos then there would be plenty of food and land to live upon.</p><br/><p>If one didn\u2019t like another then they could just go live on another Gragos.</p><br/><p>\u2018Soon, there will be peace. Finally.\u2019</p><br/><p>Taruhol, who had been uplifted from the thought of peace, hurriedly asked Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou need to finish your job, what are you going to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo handed him the cure as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cUse this cure to heal the Lazar and the Other Gragos. We will organize this place while you do this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oteon nodded at those words.</p><br/><p>There was a lot to do.</p><br/><p>They needed to get to the Holy Land, rebuild the Great Temple and prepare living spaces for the Akarons.</p><br/><p>Similar things for Hansoo as well.</p><br/><p>Since the aftermath of a war was more important than the war itself.</p><br/><p>Taruhol took the Akadus and headed off as soon as he heard this.</p><br/><p>And the remaining Oteon laughed as she spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something we need to do before that. The final part of the contract.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded at Oteon\u2019s words and slowly walked towards the Soul Telautograph capsule.</p><br/><p>Kiiiiiing</p><br/><p>Hansoo placed his hands upon the location on the capsule where the Crown used to be</p><br/><p>And as he controlled the liquid metal with the mana codes from the memory crystal, a secret compartment inside the capsule opened up.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is it huh.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo pulled out the short sword from the compartment.</p><br/><p>\u201cOhh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The holy artifact of the Akarons.</p><br/><p>And the symbol of strength that only the person who had become the Great Patriarch could use.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>As a tradition, the Garde-Barongs would prove their strength by taking out the hardest part of the Margoths they killed and fuse them together with the technique of the temple.</p><br/><p>This alone would create a formidable artifact but this went a step further.</p><br/><p>One would insert the Dragon Essence Blade in the center of the Great Temple where the essence of the White Lion, Lazar, stormed and make it absorb the energy.</p><br/><p>The moment one puts the completed Dragon Essence Blade into their body they would receive the energy of the Margoth\u2019s body and the Gragos\u2019s essence.</p><br/><p>It was the first time Oteon was seeing this as well since it was always within the body of the Great Patriach.</p><br/><p>\u2018Though it\u2019s the Akaron\u2019s holy artifact\u2026.\u2019</p><br/><p>Oteon, who had been making a slightly regrettable expression, shook off her emotions and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake it. We should at least do this much to the savior of our race.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Dragon Essence Blade was a necessary artifact for the Great Patriarch to have absolute strength and authority.</p><br/><p>Since the Great Patriarch needed to use his strength to control his subjects from time to time.</p><br/><p>But in that regards the Crown of Thorns and the Akadus was even beyond that.</p><br/><p>Having both these artifacts after attaining the Crown of Thorns was a bit too much.</p><br/><p>Hansoo who was going off to the next world would use it much better anyway.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo made a slightly dejected expression.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026It\u2019s not as good as I expected.\u2019</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t bad.</p><br/><p>Since it seemed like a high ranker even out of the double numberings.</p><br/><p>But it was a step down from his Forked Lightning, Nurmaha\u2019s Ring or the Thousand Soldiers Armor.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tsk. Maybe it\u2019s because all the essence from the Gragos has been emptied.\u2019</p><br/><p>Of course it wouldn\u2019t have all the essence remaining inside since it had been in this place for hundreds of years.</p><br/><p>Hansoo quickly recovered in order to not show his emotions as he spoke to Oteon.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, I\u2019ll use it well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Nothing I can do about it.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo chuckled.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t too stressed on getting strong all by himself and an artifact of this level could be gained from other places as well.</p><br/><p>He completed his task very well.</p><br/><p>Since he had cured the Gragos and created an environment where all the humans who would come after would be able to live and receive the Body Enhancement Surgery.</p><br/><p>\u2018I should go out and organize as well.\u2019</p><br/><p>Soon Hansoo and the Akarons moved away from the Soul Telautograph headed towards the battlefield that would\u2019ve calmed down by now.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Kiiiiing</p><br/><p>Taruhol moved the numerous golden Akadus he was flying on towards the holy land of the Lazar.</p><br/><p>\u2018The most urgent task if healing the Lazar.\u2019</p><br/><p>The cure of the Lazar was a necessity in order to supply the countless amounts of survivors upon the Lazar.</p><br/><p>\u2018We would be able to let the kids eat to their fill. The humans would be happy as well.\u2019</p><br/><p>Taruhol smiled as he flew down with the ten golden Akadus.</p><br/><p>And then looked at the Tao-Bao, the place where the Great Patriarch used to live upon, with tremendous amounts of emotion.</p><br/><p>Along with the Soul Telautograph on the center of this location.</p><br/><p>\u2018Oh great Mekido\u2026 Your descendents have returned.\u2019</p><br/><p>The three Soul Telautographs that had infected the Lazar with the Calamity of Death.</p><br/><p>The first Soul Telautograph has been moved to the Holy Land by the Elkadion for research but the other two had still remained on the body of the Lazar while being protected by the Tiradus.</p><br/><p>And the two had injected the poison onto Lazar at the same time.</p><br/><p>And the Great Patriarch, Mekido, who had thought that destroying these things would do immediately destroyed the one Elkadion was researching and headed towards the other two but was instead assaulted by two black Tiradus.</p><br/><p>He had been able to kill the two Tiradus with the strength of the holy artifact, , but also died in the process.</p><br/><p>But Elkadion realized that destroying the Telautographs wouldn\u2019t do anything, moved the two Soul Telautographs to the Holy Land and researched them in order to move onto the next world.</p><br/><p>The Soul Telautograph in front of his eyes was that exact Soul Telautograph.</p><br/><p>One was in Arklateori and the other in the Holy Land.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s see. He said I just needed to put the cure\u2026In here right.\u2019</p><br/><p>As he dropped the cure onto the Soul Telautograph, a sound of activation rang out as a white light exploded out.</p><br/><p>Soon something white started to spread out from the Telautograph and into the Lazar\u2019s entire body.</p><br/><p>Taruhol made a content expression as he looked at this.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s easy.\u2019</p><br/><p>This current work upon the Lazar was too easy.</p><br/><p>Since the two Tiradus had already been killed from the heroic efforts of Mekido.</p><br/><p>Taruhol started to move towards the other black Gragoses which were approaching them from the distance but then suddenly stopped.</p><br/><p>Since his head started to ache the moment he thought of Mekido and the Dragon Essence Blade.</p><br/><p>The Crown of Thorns upon his head reddened even deeper as it bore into his head a bit more.</p><br/><p>At the same time another bit of information flew into his brain.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026The Dragon Essence Blade is somewhere else?\u2019</p><br/><p>A slightly disturbing sensation was felt inside his head but Taruhol shook off the sensation.</p><br/><p>Since the information about the Dragon Essence Blade was much more important than some discomfort.</p><br/><p>The Crown of Thorns had informed him.</p><br/><p>That the Dragon Essence Blade upon the Soul Telautograph was something to distract the invaders just in case.</p><br/><p>The real one was hidden somewhere else.</p><br/><p>Taruhol pondered for a moment at the location of the Dragon Essence Blade and then nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm\u2026Good. It felt like our gift was a bit lacking anyway. I should find it and give it to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo would be shocked as well.</p><br/><p>Once he received the real one after being dejected by a crappy present.</p><br/><p>Taruhol finished his thoughts and then flew up upon the golden Akadus with a joyous expression.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

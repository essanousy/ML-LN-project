He\u2019s not really the greatest friend of mine, but he wouldn\u2019t have lied. So don\u2019t worry. Everything is fine, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>The girl, Erunheim, gritted her teeth as she listened to the man.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn...I don\u2019t know how much I can trust him.\u2019</p><br/><p>Although they had allied due to unfortunate circumstances, and they did have quite a considerable amount of strength, she couldn\u2019t drop her guard.</p><br/><p>They were from a different race after all.</p><br/><p>Aliens.</p><br/><p>Unlike her, who had to stay and die in this world, they were just passersby.</p><br/><p>Since they were in a different situation, she didn\u2019t know what their true goals were either.</p><br/><p>But she could only stay with this man and the other aliens.</p><br/><p>Her situation wasn\u2019t good enough to just ignore them and walk away.</p><br/><p>Her opponent was too strong.</p><br/><p>\u2018The Nell family\u2026 those damned bastards.\u2019</p><br/><p>Thinking of those guys, her old scars hurt.</p><br/><p>The scars of that day when their nation had fallen to the invaders, and they were forced to escape with the other refugees.</p><br/><p>\u2018Soon. I will have\u2026 my revenge.\u2019</p><br/><p>The woman held onto her side as she frowned.</p><br/><p>There was no way to beat them face-to-face.</p><br/><p>So she had thrown away everything and escaped to this place.</p><br/><p>And the Dragon God Armors, fleets, soldiers, and the factories.</p><br/><p>All of these things.</p><br/><p>They had stolen a bit here and there, but that was the limit.</p><br/><p>To go against the Neropa Union and the Pompeion Empire that continuously pumped out fleets?</p><br/><p>Suicide.</p><br/><p>Of course, the gap between them was already large, and it was only growing larger.</p><br/><p>So they needed something to change.</p><br/><p>Even if they had to hold hands with the devil.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ha\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Erunheim looked at the man before her eyes and said:</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sure everything is going according to plan?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man shrugged.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you already? That\u2019s all we need. Why did you guys run here? It\u2019s because of that, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014 </p><br/><p>Erunheim looked at the shining object in the depths and shut up.</p><br/><p>\u2018Right\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>The place the outsiders called the was actually a land of mystery.</p><br/><p>They had tried multiple times to live in this place, but they always failed.</p><br/><p>Because mysterious monsters roamed the depths of this place.</p><br/><p>Of course, it wasn\u2019t a land of mystery because they couldn\u2019t deal with it using the Dragon God Armor or their fleet.</p><br/><p>No, the exact opposite.</p><br/><p>Although the monsters looked scary and were much stronger than normal people, they were still nothing in the face of the Flame\u2019s power.</p><br/><p>The monsters simply melted before the Dragon God Soldiers and their fleet.</p><br/><p>But there was another reason why they couldn't enter.</p><br/><p>Because they couldn\u2019t use the power of the Flame inside here.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yeah\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Erunheim looked to the depths again.</p><br/><p>To the bright-red crystal.</p><br/><p>Nobody knew what that palm-sized crystal was, where it came from, or what it was made of.</p><br/><p>Since they had only found it by luck anyway.</p><br/><p>But they were clear about one thing.</p><br/><p>The crystal down there had the power to suppress the .</p><br/><p>No matter how powerful the force.</p><br/><p>The area surrounding the small crystal, spanning a radius of 500 kilometers, could not use the power of the Flame.</p><br/><p>That was how powerful it was.</p><br/><p>Despite just being a tiny crystal.</p><br/><p>It suppressed the , which powered a fleet that could destroy an entire moon.</p><br/><p>And they had been able to hide in Reyunion because of this.</p><br/><p>Without that, either the Neropa Union\u2019s fleet or a Dragon Soldier would have long since killed them off.</p><br/><p>In other words...</p><br/><p>With that\u2026</p><br/><p>They wouldn\u2019t need to fear the nine fleets under the Neropa Union.</p><br/><p>Nor their proud army of Dragon God Soldiers.</p><br/><p>Since they were nothing more than hunks of metal without the Flame.</p><br/><p>She would show them their strength.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes\u2026 this is all we need.\u2019</p><br/><p>Erunheim glared at the tiny red crystal that refused to come out.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014 </p><br/><p>Kiriel shrugged as she stared at the people walking towards them.</p><br/><p>Although they seemed like they had enhanced bodies, they were nothing more than normal people in her eyes.</p><br/><p>And though they had weapons in their hand, they looked like normal weapons and not weapons that used the Flame.</p><br/><p>\u2018Pfft.\u2019</p><br/><p>Kiriel scoffed inwardly as she stared at the people who looked at them for a moment before quickly running away.</p><br/><p>She had been worried about Dragon God Soldiers or the fleet ambushing them.</p><br/><p>Despite how easily she could handle the Dragon God Soldiers, the fleet was a different story.</p><br/><p>The power of the giant metal fortresses in the sky was nothing compared to the Dragon God Soldiers.</p><br/><p>She was worried that they\u2019d fly beneath the atmosphere to attack them, but it seems that wasn\u2019t the case.</p><br/><p>R-Korun Nell\u2019s mumbles proved it all.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh\u2026 This cursed land. Makes me uneasy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014clank\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014clank\u2014 </p><br/><p>R-Korun Nell complained since his Dragon God Armor had turned into a piece of normal armor due to the absence of the Flame\u2019s power.</p><br/><p>This is what he hated most about the trash dump.</p><br/><p>Kiriel seemed to have realized something as she looked at R-Korun Nell and said to Hansoo:</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyway\u2026 It looks like most of us lived in this place before the barrier against the Abyss had been destroyed right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded.</p><br/><p>It was just as she said.</p><br/><p>Outside this place, where the Flame\u2019s power still existed, normal adventurers couldn\u2019t beat the power of the Dragon God Soldiers and the fleet no matter what.</p><br/><p>But it was different inside here.</p><br/><p>Without the power of the Flame.</p><br/><p>They were just like normal humans.</p><br/><p>Although they were slightly stronger than normal humans because of their genetic and body modifications, they were still weak.</p><br/><p>So most of the normal adventurers had stayed in here before the Abyss fell on them.</p><br/><p>They had hunted the monsters that roamed around here and then climbed up after gathering enough runes.</p><br/><p>Of course, the difficulty was extremely high since this place was the 6th Zone after all.</p><br/><p>There were also a few other problems, but they didn\u2019t really matter much.</p><br/><p>Since the people who had survived back then were the elites of elites working under Clementine.</p><br/><p>\u2018But\u2026 not anymore.\u2019</p><br/><p>Their goals were different so the way they acted should be different as well.</p><br/><p>If their sole goal was survival, then, of course, things would be simpler.</p><br/><p>They just needed to stick around in here for a bit, and then go up after killing some monsters.</p><br/><p>But this wasn\u2019t good.</p><br/><p>If they didn\u2019t handle this place, then the Nelkipa would sooner or later end up attacked.</p><br/><p>What good would it do if the 6th Zone was safe when the 5th Zone was blocked off?</p><br/><p>So they had to deal with this place.</p><br/><p>Obtain the External Flame Divine Tool and then unite all the areas.</p><br/><p>\u2018...A simple change in the goal changes the enemy.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo shrugged his shoulders as he thought of the Pompeion Empire and the Neropa Union.</p><br/><p>He just needed to take things step by step.</p><br/><p>Of course, it wasn\u2019t only their goals that had changed but their situations as well.</p><br/><p>Since they weren\u2019t normal adventurers whose growth was limited by the wall but instead were Transcendents.</p><br/><p>Of course, without strength, people couldn\u2019t go out from this place even if they wanted to.</p><br/><p>They were stuck in this place.</p><br/><p>But Transcendents were different.</p><br/><p>3-Stars could fight with starships.</p><br/><p>And 4-Stars could even fight against an entire fleet.</p><br/><p>\u2014kuduk\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo felt the hammer and the blue armor as he started to move.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>According to what he knew, this place was the outskirts of the , a place that suppressed the strength of the Flame due to the External Flame Divine Tool.</p><br/><p>And the location of the divine tool was at the very center of the Flameless Land.</p><br/><p>They needed to get there first.</p><br/><p>Kiriel followed after Hansoo as she asked:</p><br/><p>\u201cRight\u2026 so are Clementine\u2019s underlings our current enemy?\u201c</p><br/><p>If the people of the Flame weren\u2019t a threat to them, then there were only two types of beings that could threaten them.</p><br/><p>The monsters of the Abyss.</p><br/><p>And Clementine\u2019s underlings.</p><br/><p>Since the two were those who disliked them the most.</p><br/><p>Hansoo shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI need to look at the situation for a bit\u2026 It could be a bit different.\u201d</p><br/><p>With a change in their objectives, the situation would change.</p><br/><p>In other words, their objectives might change depending on the situation.</p><br/><p>He had opened the barrier to the Abyss, and the others had gained the strength to roam outside the Flameless Land.</p><br/><p>\u2018Clementine\u2026 would not have picked the choice of sitting around.\u2019</p><br/><p>And if Clementine had picked the choice of escaping this tiny pen and escaping into the vast land past it\u2026 </p><br/><p>Who would have taken over this leaderless place instead?</p><br/><p>\u2018This would be a good place to gain some strength.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo thought, looking around the Flameless Land.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u2014swooooosh!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014kuaaaahhh!\u2014 </p><br/><p>A head flew off from a blade.</p><br/><p>And the beheaded existence made a grotesque noise as it fell to the ground.</p><br/><p>But it was clear that its existence wasn\u2019t an ordinary one.</p><br/><p>It should have left behind a corpse, but that existence quickly disappeared and melted away.</p><br/><p>\u2014ssssss\u2014 </p><br/><p>A man picked up a crystal where the corpse should\u2019ve been and smiled.</p><br/><p>\u2018Good. Very good.\u2019</p><br/><p>This was an amazing place to raise one\u2019s strength.</p><br/><p>He was able to monopolize the Abyssal monsters that came out from the elevator with nobody to disturb him.</p><br/><p>The people of Reyunion lacked the power to go against him, so he just needed to slowly hunt and raise his strength.</p><br/><p>Even better since they treated him with the utmost respect.</p><br/><p>He was living like a king.</p><br/><p>But the man\u2019s expression turned dark.</p><br/><p>There was only one reason why he was living this life.</p><br/><p>Because those who truly deserved to live like kings had all left.</p><br/><p>\u2014crack!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The man tightly clenched the crystal in his hand and thought:</p><br/><p>\u2018Those bastards\u2026 left to take over the Empire and Neropa Union. I could have as well. Sangjin\u2026 You aren\u2019t the only one who\u2019s so amazing and all that.\u2019</p><br/><p>As long as he could gain that mysterious object, he could leave as well.</p><br/><p>The man headed towards the headquarters as he clenched his teeth.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s see what news the scouts have.\u2019</p><br/><p>The people of Reyunion were weak, but they were numerous in number and had good communication methods, so they were useful as scouts.</p><br/><p>The man thought of the scouts which he\u2019d sent out in case the Transcendents came back and quickly started to move.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

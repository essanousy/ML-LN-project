Did we have to kill them? Clementine?\u2019</p><br/><p>Someone said once.</p><br/><p>That once you are held back by the chains of reality, the past comes back to you.</p><br/><p>Jang Oh thought back to the things he had done and fell into sadness.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>Booooooom!</p><br/><p>Hansoo frowned as he looked at Jang Oh who was attacking him.</p><br/><p>He, who was armed with countless Zero-umbering skills, was extremely powerful.</p><br/><p>But between himself, who had only trained for a year, and Jang Oh who had 20 years to increase the mastery of his skills, there was indeed a huge difference.</p><br/><p>And even more so since people like Taehee and Jang Oh were the elites of the elites.</p><br/><p>Chwaaaak!</p><br/><p>The moment the red powder spread out into the air.</p><br/><p>Black shadows spread out to block the red powder and reduced the damage.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Boooboboooom!</p><br/><p>Countless skills whose their original identities could not be made out because of the shadows smashed Hansoo\u2019s body, his reinforcement and his armor.</p><br/><p>Though he was superior in terms of physical strength and artifacts, that one shield neutralized it all.</p><br/><p>Kiiiiiiing!</p><br/><p>\u2018...I guess he trusts this guy. For them to lend him a Divine Weapon.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo mumbled as he looked at the shield that was slowly gnawing away at his mana with the the yellow lights.</p><br/><p>Arham\u2019s Shield.</p><br/><p>A shield which dispersed all forms of energy that were malicious towards it.</p><br/><p>Though it didn\u2019t have a uniquely powerful attack like the God\u2019s Flail, this single passive skill\u2019s effect in a battle was tremendous on its own.</p><br/><p>Though it was a bit inferior to the Power Destruction of Nurmaha\u2019s Ring, it still worked as a form of dispelling.</p><br/><p>If he didn\u2019t have enough mana or the Mana Jade, then his mana would long have dried out.</p><br/><p>Hansoo started to worry.</p><br/><p>\u2018At this rate\u2026 I indeed would win.\u2019</p><br/><p>Boooooom!</p><br/><p>Hansoo mumbled while looking at Jang Oh who had turned pale.</p><br/><p>Though it was better than the situation with Metiron, Taehee, who should be roaming around the indigo or even the violet zone, was much stronger than Jang Oh.</p><br/><p>Even if it was a fragment, the body could not withstand it.</p><br/><p>But the real issue was behind him.</p><br/><p>Ooooooooongg!</p><br/><p>The sounds that were coming from the large structure behind him were getting louder and louder.</p><br/><p>No, the aura that was being released from that place was the issue.</p><br/><p>Rummmmblee!</p><br/><p>A huge amount of mana that could even shake the lands below was seeping out.</p><br/><p>Oooooooong!</p><br/><p>If one could color the auras that were seeping out then there would be numerous dozens of different colors.</p><br/><p>Countless types of Spirit\u2019s Auras.</p><br/><p>And the pressure that was being radiated was so intense that it caused both he and Jang Oh\u2019s skins to tremble but the surrounding trees were just becoming more invigorated.</p><br/><p>The reason why Hansoo was so sure of his victory was because of this.</p><br/><p>Oooooong!</p><br/><p>Unlike Jang Oh who already had something inside him, Hansoo\u2019s symbol was trembling intensely as it absorbing all the surrounding auras of the Spirits.</p><br/><p>And thanks to this Hansoo\u2019s entire body was glowing with lights as well.</p><br/><p>Whoooosh!</p><br/><p>Flames appeared every time he swung his arms and lightning appeared where his spear smashed onto the ground.</p><br/><p>Originally, the Arham\u2019s Shield should be gnawing away at his reinforcement and making it harder to battle but the energy from the Spirits was filling the gaps.</p><br/><p>\u2018Did she give me the symbol after having expected all of this?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo thought of Mudusella and started to recapitulate the current situation.</p><br/><p>He had the upper hand in the fight.</p><br/><p>But even though the situation behind him allowed him to have the upper hand in this battle, leaving it alone didn\u2019t really make him feel any better.</p><br/><p>Though it was all within his expectations, if this amount of energy exploded in the wrong direction then that itself was more than enough to become a catastrophe.</p><br/><p>\u2018...I need to deal with that first.\u2019</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Boooooom!</p><br/><p>Hansoo raised the Forked Lightning and then attacked Jang Oh.</p><br/><p>The Shield let out rays of yellow light to disperse his reinforcement but countless colors filled the gap where the reinforcement had been.</p><br/><p>Craaack!</p><br/><p>Wind, Lightning and Flames stormed the location where the shield and the spear collided.</p><br/><p>To the point of even causing the darkness surrounding Jang Oh\u2019s body to retreat.</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>As Jang Oh couldn\u2019t handle the power behind Hansoo\u2019s attack and took numerous steps backwards.</p><br/><p>Whoooosh!</p><br/><p>Hansoo moved his body and charged towards the structure.</p><br/><p>Ignoring Jang Oh completely.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jang Oh, no, Taehee looked towards Hansoo\u2019s back and shrugged his shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u2018Can\u2019t follow that. Anyways...He\u2019s really strong.\u2019</p><br/><p>The auras that Hansoo was absorbing had come out from that structure.</p><br/><p>The closer Hansoo got to that building, the faster he would absorb the auras and the stronger he would get.</p><br/><p>Fighting against Hansoo in a situation like this where they were already in the losing situation was basically suicide.</p><br/><p>Taehee decided to give up and turned around depressedly.</p><br/><p>\u2018I had a lot to talk about...I guess I need to look for another chance.\u2019</p><br/><p>There hadn\u2019t been a chance to say a word but she had come here with a lot to talk about.</p><br/><p>But eventually another chance would arise.</p><br/><p>Since that guy didn\u2019t seem to like her which meant that they would eventually meet again.</p><br/><p>Whoooosh!</p><br/><p>Jang Oh\u2019s body that was surrounded in darkness disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>Ooooooooooong!</p><br/><p>Hansoo quickly ran past the glass orbs and headed deeper.</p><br/><p>He could still see the footprints that had been left behind within this place.</p><br/><p>Hansoo eventually arrived at a place.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo frowned as he looked at the mysterious object in front of him.</p><br/><p>Rummmblee!</p><br/><p>A giant sphere that had taken position inside the giant structure.</p><br/><p>The giant sphere, which had the radius of a hundred meters was floating in mid air as it devoured the energy that had flowed out from the spheres he had run past.</p><br/><p>Hansoo was curious about the identity of the sphere but he had something else he had to worry about.</p><br/><p>\u2018....Where did he go?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo was confused as he looked at the panels beside the sphere.</p><br/><p>Since this giant structure wouldn\u2019t move on its own, the player definitely activated this himself.</p><br/><p>But there was no trace of the player who activated this.</p><br/><p>Not even the trace of battle.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Did he logout or something?\u2019</p><br/><p>As Hansoo frowned thinking about the player who suddenly disappeared.</p><br/><p>Rummmblee!</p><br/><p>A tremendous earthquake could be felt.</p><br/><p>\u2018This\u2026.?\u2019</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t really an earthquake.</p><br/><p>Hansoo was slightly worried about the whole space collapsing.</p><br/><p>Booooom!</p><br/><p>As if it finally started acting up, the sphere in front of him began to let out a blinding amount of light.</p><br/><p>At the same time.</p><br/><p>Rummmblee.</p><br/><p>Hansoo finally realized why the earthquake had occurred and what the giant sphere in front of his eyes was.</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s body and the room he was located in started to slowly rise up.</p><br/><p>Smashing through the countless layers of ice above.</p><br/><p>\u2018... It was an engine...?\u2019</p><br/>\n</div>"}

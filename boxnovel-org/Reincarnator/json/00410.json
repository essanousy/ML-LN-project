Everyone is trying to get in my way.\u2019</p><br/><p>At first, he\u2019d been held back by the man called Pompeion.</p><br/><p>He\u2019d managed to dodge away from Pompeion and was about to cover the area he arrived at with the interdimensional barrier, but an unforeseen situation had occurred.</p><br/><p>Since he had failed to acquire the Nelkipa, he had to succeed here no matter what.</p><br/><p>\u2018I guess I\u2019ll have to call those people.\u2019</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t just going to call those weaklings outside, they had only received the outer shells.</p><br/><p>Well, he couldn\u2019t really communicate with them anyway, and neither did he want to.</p><br/><p>The ones he wanted to call on were different.</p><br/><p>The beings who not only received a new outer shell but had also used their inner souls to complete the ceremony.</p><br/><p>As he decided to call those three\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014whooooosh\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014the red device in his hand started to rumble vigorously.</p><br/><p>Then three flames appeared inside his head.</p><br/><p>These flames weren\u2019t simple at all\u2014they were control fragments of the soul he had planted inside the beings of this world.</p><br/><p>And as if they had noticed he had called them, one of the flames moved about and sent him a message.</p><br/><p>&lt;...What\u2019s wrong? I told you not to use this if you didn\u2019t have to, I told you this feels uncomfortable.&gt;</p><br/><p>A rough man\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>It seemed like he wasn\u2019t the only one who felt disturbed by this since the other two flames also showed similar emotions through the soul.</p><br/><p>The man holding the red device used his soul to relay a message to the two men and the lone woman.</p><br/><p>The three flames trembled.</p><br/><p>All three felt shocked.</p><br/><p>And soon\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014their souls started to vibrate again as they began to speak.</p><br/><p>&lt;...It looks like these aliens are either missing their left or right brains. They could\u2019ve just worked together to deal with him.&gt;</p><br/><p>The man holding the device made an annoyed expression as he spoke.</p><br/><p>The three flames trembled fiercely again.</p><br/><p>&lt;...That really is disturbing. You need all three of us to deal with one man?&gt;</p><br/><p>The man smirked and chuckled.</p><br/><p>There was no reason for a lion to be scared of three dogs who were much weaker than itself, especially when the dogs were also scheming to strike each other in the back.</p><br/><p>A lion would only be wary of another lion.</p><br/><p>This was why he couldn\u2019t reveal himself.</p><br/><p>At least, not yet.</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble!\u2014</p><br/><p>The man sent the message, listening to the deafening noise grow increasingly louder with every passing second.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>The Blood Immortal.</p><br/><p>Hansoo used Mary Valentine\u2019s power to hold back the Dragon God Soldiers and continued to descend.</p><br/><p>And as the two of them descended, Kiriel could see countless bright circuits covering the underground space below Neoreim.</p><br/><p>\u2018...What are these for?\u2019</p><br/><p>The well-organized circuits had tremendous amounts of energy flowing through them.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Hansoo checked the direction of their objective with the Relic in his hand.</p><br/><p>\u2014ooooong\u2014</p><br/><p>It was so accurate that it responded with every step it drew closer.</p><br/><p>Like it wanted to show Hansoo exactly how to get there.</p><br/><p>\u2018This way.\u2019</p><br/><p>And as he was about to head towards the direction of the other Relic.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhhhh! Kang Hansoo!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kuoooo!</p><br/><p>Someone shouted from outside, their voice accompanied by the tremendously loud sound of animals chasing after the Relic.</p><br/><p>And Kiriel chuckled at this.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like those things are really in a hurry.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sounds were growing louder by the second, telling them that Samuel and the Haetara were rushing towards their location.</p><br/><p>Their frenzied behavior only meant that he was heading closer and closer to the goal.</p><br/><p>The less composure their opponents had, the higher the advantage they would gain.</p><br/><p>\u2018But\u2026 not bad.\u2019</p><br/><p>Kiriel saw one of the red scorpions being thrown down from above, its body beaten until it was left half-destroyed.</p><br/><p>Although it was good that they were in a rush, but such urgency was actually making them use everything they had as well.</p><br/><p>Since Hansoo was heading in the right direction, it was causing their enemies to literally go on a rampage.</p><br/><p>They were basically sacrificing their bodies just to create a small opening at this point.</p><br/><p>Although the red scorpions had followed Hansoo\u2019s orders and blocked their path, the rate of their destruction was increasing due to the Dragon God Soldiers going berserk.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhh! Stop right there!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014kacha!\u2014</p><br/><p>The Dragon God Soldiers who had succeeded in passing through the scorpions aimed their weapons against Hansoo and attacked.</p><br/><p>There was no need to kill or even damage him in the slightest.</p><br/><p>They just needed to hold him down and the others would come to help out.</p><br/><p>But the reality was cruel.</p><br/><p>\u2014whooosh!\u2014</p><br/><p>Hansoo covered himself in a dark translucent barrier once again and then placed his finger into his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u2018Wait.. No\u2026 NO!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014snip\u2014</p><br/><p>As Hansoo bit his finger\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014pshhhh!\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014an even larger spray of blood filled the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cDAMMMITT!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Leaving the Dragon God Soldiers screaming in rage before an even greater number of scorpions, Hansoo and Kiriel quickly headed deeper inside.</p><br/><p>Kiriel looked back with pity in her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough they\u2019re our enemies\u2026 I really feel bad for them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo responded without a change in expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cTheir outcomes have already been decided.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiriel looked confused by Hansoo\u2019s response and stole another glance behind her.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit! Dammit! Dammit!\u201d</p><br/><p>R-Palcon Ron was inwardly grieved as he looked at the couple disappearing into the distance.</p><br/><p>\u2018Please\u2026 Somebody, help us\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>There was no hope.</p><br/><p>An even larger number of scorpions were now heading their way while the two aliens were rushing down at a tremendous speed.</p><br/><p>The aliens that were meant to act as reinforcements were on their way over, but there was still plenty of time before they would arrive.</p><br/><p>They\u2019d be massacred before those aliens would even get here.</p><br/><p>Kuoooo!</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Listening to the loud cries of the mountainous beasts, he felt like his future had been fully prophesized.</p><br/><p>One, he would be ripped apart by the red scorpions.</p><br/><p>Two, be stomped to death by the mountains.</p><br/><p>Or three, killed off by the head of the family for not having accomplished their mission.</p><br/><p>There were no such things as miracles.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why am I struggling here\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>As R-Palcon Ron gave up and dropped his weapon, a bloody scorpion\u2019s tail rushed towards him.</p><br/><p>But at that moment\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014a miracle really did happen.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho said you could die however you wanted? You can\u2019t die here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?...Uh? Family Head? How are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>R-Palcon Ron saw a woman appear before his eyes and crush the scorpion. Baffled, he saw that it was K-Adelaia Ron.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Is this a dream?\u2019</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t believe his eyes.</p><br/><p>Whether he was bewildered that the family head had crushed the scorpion without using the Dragon God Armor or a weapon, despite being rumored to have no offensive capabilities\u2026</p><br/><p>Or how she was here at this moment, when she should\u2019ve been at the frontlines.</p><br/><p>But one of his questions was soon answered.</p><br/><p>Two male voices could be heard from behind K-Adelaia Ron.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn\u2026 It really does take a toll on your health if you try to do a long-distance Quantum Transmission with just your bare body.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up and clean this place up first. Do you know how valuable these Dragon God Soldiers are?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, don\u2019t order me around, you bastard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014</p><br/><p>A blinding light appeared before R-Palcon Ron\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>A light so blinding that despite being protected behind the visors, his eyes felt like they were burning up.</p><br/><p>But he kept his eyes open.</p><br/><p>And was utterly bewildered.</p><br/><p>\u2018Holy\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014booooooom!\u2014</p><br/><p>The red scorpions that they were having such a hard time against were instantly swept away by the attacks of the three family heads.</p><br/><p>Of course, the scorpions weren\u2019t the only ones that were destroyed.</p><br/><p>The powerful layers that could even withstand a Miprosky-level weapon were melting away as well.</p><br/><p>\u2018I never realized that they were this strong\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>R-Palcon Ron felt a tremendous amount of pride.</p><br/><p>That mountainous amount of strength.</p><br/><p>And their god-like attitudes.</p><br/><p>This was it.</p><br/><p>This was the image that suited the people who led these giant clans.</p><br/><p>But at the same time, he was at a loss.</p><br/><p>They were worth almost nothing to them after this but the family heads had still come to save them.</p><br/><p>\u2018Head\u2026 I promise my utmost loyalty to you until the end.\u2019</p><br/><p>R-Palcon Ron felt that something was weird.</p><br/><p>It was that strange expression on K-Adelaia Ron\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Is she feeling bad for me?\u2019</p><br/><p>Why was she feeling bad for him?</p><br/><p>\u201cRon! This isn\u2019t the time for that! Don\u2019t try to act kind by yourself! We need to use everything we have to guard against those things!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn\u2026 I didn\u2019t know their numbers had dropped by this much.\u201d</p><br/><p>K-Merrow Nell\u2019s sharp words.</p><br/><p>K-Ukatan Pael\u2019s strange words.</p><br/><p>\u201c...Head? What do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>As R-Palcon Ron was lost in confusion\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014K-Adelaia Ron spoke out with an apologetic tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014kacha!\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cKaaaaa!...What?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shocked, R-Palcon Ron looked at his heart which had shrunk to almost nothing in an instant.</p><br/><p>And it wasn\u2019t just him.</p><br/><p>\u2014 kachaha!\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014 chakak!\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhukk!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuaah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Gasps and screams of pain could be heard from all around.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014 rumble!\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014the powerful energy of the Flame being squeezed out from their hearts started to flow towards one direction.</p><br/><p>Towards K-Adelaia Ron.</p><br/><p>And every time she devoured the energy of another soldier, she would shine brighter and brighter.</p><br/><p>And amidst his now fading conscious, R-Palcon Ron realized the truth.</p><br/><p>Why they had been created.</p><br/><p>Why the family heads had treated them so well.</p><br/><p>\u2018We were just lunchboxes\u2026 Damn.\u2019</p><br/><p>R-Palcon Ron closed his eyes, glaring at K-Adelaia Ron with hate.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u2014 rumble\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cUaaaahh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As Kiriel looked up at the melting ceiling, Hansoo touched the shining Relic..</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s time.\u2019</p><br/>\n</div>"}

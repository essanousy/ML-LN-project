Where did the change happen?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm. So that Kang Hansoo did something that amazing? Mister?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Gwanje, the patriarch of the Rerorerore clan, mumbled after hearing the story of the person in front of them.</p><br/><p>And Jongsang, one of the Seven Departed Souls, smiled as he looked at that Gwanje.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Amazing right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jongsang had immediately gotten caught by some mysterious people and was dragged here.</p><br/><p>He tried to resist but he couldn\u2019t even handle the people who were called Baladi level here.</p><br/><p>And here the person who he had seen before in the past was sitting as the Boss.</p><br/><p>Kim Gwanje.</p><br/><p>A person whom he had saved the life of in the past just for fun.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well I knew he wasn\u2019t a simple guy but\u2026 He has really become a monster.\u2019</p><br/><p>Gwanje was treating him extremely well.</p><br/><p>Others might look at Gwanje treating the savior of his life and say he\u2019s a very good person but Jongsang, who knew a bit about this guy, knew why.</p><br/><p>The reason why this guy was being nice to him was not because he had saved his life or because they were both Koreans.</p><br/><p>That guy just wanted to show off to him.</p><br/><p>Towards Jongsang who had a tremendous amount of influence which he couldn\u2019t even chase after.</p><br/><p>The result of his work which he had accomplished in the Orange Zone.</p><br/><p>\u2018He is a guy who was this way since back in the past.\u2019</p><br/><p>A person who was always shouting that there would only be one pillar instead of six if he had come first.</p><br/><p>He had looked over every corner of the World Tree and just left along with his followers.</p><br/><p>After throwing away the patriarch position of the Hecarim Clan that had been set already.</p><br/><p>It had already been 4 years ago.</p><br/><p>\u2018He should be quite pissed.\u2019</p><br/><p>Jongsang laughed as he looked at Gwanje laughing as well.</p><br/><p>A person who lived on the taste of his own greatness.</p><br/><p>That guy couldn\u2019t even muster up the courage to even touch the Calamities and just moved himself away.</p><br/><p>And had actually grown after showing his true strength after getting to the Orange Zone.</p><br/><p>But somebody had dealt with those Calamities from below and then came up.</p><br/><p>Though it was laughing on the surface, he would probably be extremely pissed inside.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. What are you going to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gwanje shrugged his shoulders after listening to Jongsang\u2019s story.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell. Thank you for the story. But I had a plan for something like this already.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jongsang frowned as he heard Gwanje\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cMister. You saw what this thing looked like right? Who do you think will be stronger if you compare with the Calamity?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then Jongsang spoke as he saw Gwanje asking him while pointing towards the existence called the Gragos that they were standing on and then replied without even a need for thinking about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course this thing is much stronger.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Calamities lived up to their name as calamities but these Gragos were on a different level.</p><br/><p>Gwanje giggled as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think so right? Wouldn\u2019t it be so much more amazing if I kill this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jongsang thought that he had heard wrong as he got suspicious of his own ears.</p><br/><p>If somebody had said this he would\u2019ve thought that they were crazy but this guy was not somebody who just said random words.</p><br/><p>Since he had created a giant clan which had carved up their spot in the Orange Zone in a mere 4 years.</p><br/><p>\u2018No, where is he planning to live after killing this thing\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>At that time he kind of understood what this guy was thinking of.</p><br/><p>\u2018Keldian. Eres. Kim Kangtae. Pao Ren\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>The owners of the six pillars.</p><br/><p>And the amazing feats that these people had left behind.</p><br/><p>This guy was trying to accomplish something that couldn\u2019t even be compared to those things.</p><br/><p>Something that everyone will look at and respect, a feat that would become a legend in the Otherworld.</p><br/><p>Only for his own pride.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026This guy is also a lunatic.\u2019</p><br/><p>Gwanje spoke towards that Jongsang.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was going to do this in a year actually. But wouldn\u2019t that amazing guy just go up in just a bit?\u201d</p><br/><p>He needed a year for perfection but he could do it at any time.</p><br/><p>No, he had already sent carrier pigeons in all directions and the plan was already on the way.</p><br/><p>\u2018You can\u2019t just go like that. See it first and then go up.\u2019</p><br/><p>A show would only have meaning if there were audiences and a proposal will only have its worth if there was somebody to make it to.</p><br/><p>That guy had gone up to the next stage within just a month of coming up.</p><br/><p>Which meant that this guy wouldn\u2019t even take 1 year to go up to the next stage.</p><br/><p>No, he might even go up in just a bit.</p><br/><p>So he had to show his hand before this guy went up.</p><br/><p>That he had done something even greater than him.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is a show just for you.\u2019</p><br/><p>Gwanje thought of Hansoo whose face he didn\u2019t even know of as he laughed.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>Hansoo mumbled as he looked at Ailen who was unconscious and hanging in his hands.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026I need to find out the reason for this first.\u2019</p><br/><p>If it was this much then somebody had intervened.</p><br/><p>It hadn\u2019t been long since the liquid\u2019s level had descended to the black zone.</p><br/><p>This amount is still fixable.</p><br/><p>He might be able to fix the problem if he removed the originator of this.</p><br/><p>But going to the temple was also important.</p><br/><p>He was stuck in a situation where he had to find the reason for the change as well as finding the temple.</p><br/><p>So Hansoo made a red carrier pigeon. (*PR: Remember, he was given an earring with that skill from the clans back in the Red Zone.)</p><br/><p>\u2018He should\u2019ve come up by now.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo pulled out the carrier pigeon and threw it towards a direction.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>Gwanje thought of Hansoo, who was going to be his audience, and then asked because the other Departed Souls came into his mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut where did the others go? Mister? Wasn\u2019t it seven including you mister?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was better the more audience there was.</p><br/><p>Departed Souls who were high and mighty in the Red Zone would be great audience.</p><br/><p>He was already feeling good from the thought of people who acted high and mighty in the Red Zone looking at him with surprised expressions.</p><br/><p>Jongsang frowned at Gwanje\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened to one\u2026 One followed that Hansoo guy. I don\u2019t know where the other five are. They aren\u2019t replying to my carrier pigeons.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Anyway\u2026 Did Miyamoto really die? Then it\u2019s a bit of a pity\u2026 His skills and artifacts are quite precious.\u2019</p><br/><p>The skills they had were amazing but the core part was Miyamoto.</p><br/><p>Because of this he had searched around all of the World Tree area, looking for traces of Miyamoto while Hansoo was hunting for runes.</p><br/><p>The result was a failure.</p><br/><p>\u2018It didn\u2019t seem like Hansoo moved during that time\u2026 Where did he go?\u2019</p><br/><p>While Jongsang squinted his eyes while thinking of Miyamoto and the other five Departed Souls, they were surprisingly all in the same place.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>Arc Mariangt, one of the Seven Departed Souls, grinded her teeth as she looked at the purple mana reinforcement exploding towards her.</p><br/><p>Though she had just been slightly grazed, her own mana reinforcement created by the Golden Reinforcement was getting shredded apart rapidly.</p><br/><p>Arc Mariangt shouted out after getting pushed to the corner.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis crazy bastard! Why are you doing this?\u201d</p><br/><p>10 years since she had been tied down by the Akuma below.</p><br/><p>And because of this, she hadn\u2019t stayed with the other Departed Souls and had separated.</p><br/><p>She needed to enjoy her life a bit now.</p><br/><p>Though it was a new zone, Arc Mariangt had complete faith in herself.</p><br/><p>That she would be able to find her place quickly with her skills and experience.</p><br/><p>\u2018But to meet a crazy bastard like this the moment I get up.\u2019</p><br/><p>Why was there no rumors when a guy like this existed?</p><br/><p>And Arc Mariangt knew instantly of what happened to Miyamoto whom Jongsang was searching for.</p><br/><p>Miyamoto\u2019s skill, Miyamoto\u2019s artifacts.</p><br/><p>Since the guy in front of him was using all of these to smash her around.</p><br/><p>Theirs were high level but Miyamoto\u2019s was a level higher.</p><br/><p>\u2018And what the hell is that purple reinforcement! Where did he get it!\u2019</p><br/><p>She had never even heard of something like that existing.</p><br/><p>Sangjin smiled while attacking Arc Mariangt.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust, I kind of need an underling but having a good one is better.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment these words ended, Sangjin\u2019s purple reinforcement burnt up all the remaining reinforcements surrounding Arc Mariangt\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>And the golden spear that had shot up from the ground like lightning smashed onto the stomach area of Arc Mariangt.</p><br/><p>Smack!</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhuk\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Arc Mariangt grinded her teeth whilst breathing out heavily from pain and grabbing onto her stomach.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastard\u2026 You think I\u2019ll listen to you because of this? Me?\u201d</p><br/><p>She realized from the attacks.</p><br/><p>His goal was capturing her alive and not killing.</p><br/><p>Which meant that he had something to ask of her.</p><br/><p>Sangjin laughed as he shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe three before you said the same thing. I don\u2019t know where one went though.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as his words ended, some people walked out from the trees.</p><br/><p>Arc Mariangt swallowed her words as she saw this.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026You guys.\u201d</p><br/><p>The 3 other Departed Souls whom she had separated from.</p><br/><p>This meant that all the Departed Souls with the exception of Miyamoto, Jongsang and Sof\u00eda had been gathered here.</p><br/><p>But they had the symbol of a Lord shining upon their hands.</p><br/><p>\u2018Who was able to\u2026?\u2019</p><br/><p>These guys couldn\u2019t be handled with normal Lords.</p><br/><p>Who had and polished such a powerful trait?</p><br/><p>While Arc Mariangt was lost in confusion, somebody walked towards Sangjin.</p><br/><p>The person who had the title of Dark Mad Lord in the past but had died and revived.</p><br/><p>Wongyung looked at Sangjin and spoke while preparing to implant the symbol of a Lord.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026If I listen to you then my daughter will be safe right?\u201d</p><br/><p>His daughter whom they had revived from the cross where he had revived at.</p><br/><p>Of course it was something Yerin did in order to keep a hostage to control him but he was still extremely thankful.</p><br/><p>But she couldn\u2019t escape her fate of being a hostage.</p><br/><p>Now she had become that man\u2019s hostage.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damnit\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Sangjin laughed at Wongyung\u2019s words and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. And I told you that this isn\u2019t bad for you either. I told you that I\u2019ll help you find your son right? You just need to listen to me well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wongyung clenched his teeth.</p><br/><p>This was why it was hard for him to kill that guy off.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026How did he find out that I had a son?\u2019</p><br/><p>A strange aura was constantly being released by Sangjin who seemed to always be a step ahead.</p><br/><p>At that moment a red carrier pigeon flew to Sangjin.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Arc Mariangt sighed at the symbol on her hands as she looked at Sangjin who was looking at the carrier pigeon with a serious expression.</p><br/><p>Though she had thoughts of rebelling during the branding process, what meaning did this have?</p><br/><p>Arc Mariangt didn\u2019t want to die yet.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn. To get binded down the moment I become free.\u2019</p><br/><p>Curiosity and loyalty were flowing into her mind as the extremely strong symbol that was beyond her imagination was burning into her.</p><br/><p>Though a suicidal order would be a bit too hard since she was quite strong on her own but she would need to keep the lord to servant relationship no matter what.</p><br/><p>Arc Mariangt sighed and realized that she didn\u2019t even know the name of the person who had made this scene and then threw a question towards Sangjin.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do I need to call you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangjin smiled as he answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need for my name since it\u2019s rather ordinary. Just call me Dark Mad Lord.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Dark Mad Lord.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn. I\u2019ve really been caught by a weird one. Why such a childish name\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Arc Mariangt threw a final question.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangjin shrugged his shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust because.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot I want to do and it won\u2019t be boring if we do it together with a lot of people. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wongyung and the others grinded their teeth at Sangjin but then started to follow after him.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I already told you everything I know!\u201d</p><br/><p>Gyesoo, who had already become a mess, looked at Hansoo who was trying to wield the that was stolen from him.</p><br/><p>For him to try killing him after he had puked out everything he knew!</p><br/><p>Gyesoo, after getting pushed back as far as he could get, shouted loudly as he looked at Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah! You Bastard! Do you know who will come once I die! The Kalz Morenn I spoke of earlier will come!\u201d</p><br/><p>Gyesoo then pointed towards his forehead.</p><br/><p>A small pink eye symbol.</p><br/><p>It was the symbol of .</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t seem to know but he\u2019s watching everything through this! If you kill me then he won\u2019t stay still!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo snorted inwardly.</p><br/><p>When the Thousand Li Eye of the Man caught within Jealousy was activated once it could only see about 3 seconds.</p><br/><p>And light pink meant that it had a low mastery level.</p><br/><p>There was no way to watch over everything with that.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo made a surprised expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat! Goddamnit! Such a guy will chase me down!\u201d</p><br/><p>Gyesoo looked at him and then laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhuhuhu. Yeah you bastard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Hurry and run away.\u2019</p><br/><p>Since he had done this much, he will not be able to kill him.</p><br/><p>There was a large difference between beating him up without knowing and killing him even after telling him that there was somebody watching behind him.</p><br/><p>Since that would mean that he would be completely ignoring Kalz Morenn.</p><br/><p>And Kalz Morenn\u2019s personality was definitely not something that would let something like that pass by.</p><br/><p>Puuk!</p><br/><p>Gyesoo tumbled around from the shock of the back of his head getting smashed.</p><br/><p>Hansoo had done this to make him pass out.</p><br/><p>\u2018As I expected.\u2019</p><br/><p>Gyesoo laughed inwardly even while losing consciousness.</p><br/><p>Since the fact that he had made him pass out meant that he feared Kalz Morenn to a degree.</p><br/><p>That guy would probably run away as quickly as possible now.</p><br/><p>Within the blurring sight, Hansoo was quickly moving towards the jungle.</p><br/><p>\u2018Run away\u2026 I\u2019ll definitely kill you.\u2019</p><br/><p>Gyesoo\u2019s thoughts ended there as he passed out.</p><br/><p>But unlike Gyesoo\u2019s thoughts, Hansoo stopped his movements and then quickly came back.</p><br/><p>\u2018Acting is tiring too.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked at the passed out Gyesoo on the ground and then stared up into the sky.</p><br/><p>Blue Carrier Pigeons, which were flying back and forth since a while ago.</p><br/><p>\u2018Soon this guy\u2019s comrades will come.\u2019</p><br/><p>According to the information Hansoo had heard from him, the 11 supervisors, including himself, and their subordinates summed up to about 100 people.</p><br/><p>It was not a low amount of people at all.</p><br/><p>And another troublesome aspect.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hmm. Kalz Morenn\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo muttered quietly.</p><br/><p>Actually Hansoo didn\u2019t know who this Kalz Morenn was.</p><br/><p>Since he couldn\u2019t remember him it seemed like this guy had died before getting to the Indigo or Purple Zone.</p><br/><p>One who could only snort around the Red Zone couldn\u2019t stay within Hansoo\u2019s memories.</p><br/><p>\u2018There\u2019s so many things to remember already.\u2019</p><br/><p>There was only one important fact.</p><br/><p>That he was the captain of the shock troop of Lighthouse.</p><br/><p>That alone told him that he was a formidable fellow.</p><br/><p>Since that spot was not something earned through poker.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t ignore the captain of the shock troop of Lighthouse.</p><br/><p>Which meant that it was impossible to gather the materials while receiving the disruptions of those guys.</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked at the passed out guy on the ground for a while and then stood up.</p><br/><p>\u2018I should prepare a bit.\u2019</p><br/><p>The main point of the sightseeing business was quite simple.</p><br/><p>Gather up the beasts, block up the paths leading out and sink all the ships.</p><br/><p>If you do just these two things then the newcomers would not be able to leave at all.</p><br/><p>They isolate the End Root like this and then go out onto the sea on the cruise ship and watch it devour the Root.</p><br/><p>Of course the main show is watching the newcomers struggling above the Root.</p><br/><p>There was no reason for backlash since the Helper clansmen would\u2019ve pulled out the people needed by the VIPs or VVIPs.</p><br/><p>\u2018First I must check which beasts have been gathered up.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo lifted up the passed out guy and then hid him in the corner of the jungle.</p><br/><p>Since he might be found before he came back.</p><br/><p>He then went into the forest as he ruthlessly used Parallel Cut to chop apart the trees and advanced through the jungle.</p><br/><p>The objective of Quadratus is blocking the newcomers from leaving the Root which the Calamity Fish will eat up.</p><br/><p>They would\u2019ve definitely gathered tons of beasts at each side of the Kukulja Lake, which acted as the boundary line.</p><br/><p>Since they won\u2019t have to guard a large perimeter if they blocked along the Kukulja lake.</p><br/><p>Kyaaaak!</p><br/><p>Roars could be heard after a short trip through the jungle.</p><br/><p>Gertas who were filled up with rage because they had lost their child couldn\u2019t get to stomp over the culprit.</p><br/><p>\u2018It was Gertas huh.\u2019</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t known which of the 13 beasts with herd-like natures they were but after checking them it was the Gertas.</p><br/><p>\u2018Good.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo, who had personally confirmed the Gertas being near, quickly headed towards a different direction.</p><br/><p>And then quickly started to harvest something in the forest.</p><br/><p>\u2018Daron Vine\u2019s Root\u2026 gathering some Amars.\u2019</p><br/><p>It would\u2019ve been hard if he was bare-bodied but the was of great help.</p><br/><p>\u2018Dumbass. That\u2019s not how you use this.\u2019</p><br/><p>That guy had been using this by pouring mana into this and either exploding or compressing it to strengthen the sword but the true usage of the was not that.</p><br/><p>Stretch.</p><br/><p>As Hansoo poured in Mana, a free-formed blade grew out.</p><br/><p>This was the true usage.</p><br/><p>Something that the guy, who only knew how to blow it up or compress it, couldn\u2019t use. A free-form blade that required the mana control to be extremely fine to the point where one can do both things simultaneously.</p><br/><p>Hansoo swung that blade in all directions as he cut off the beasts\u2019 necks and collected the needed ingredients.</p><br/><p>The free-form sword of which the length and shape kept changing constantly aimed for the unguarded spots of the beasts.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s see. I should need about 20 of them.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo, who had squeezed out the incense pouch of 20 Amars along with a few other ingredients, approached the Gertas who were aggressively roaming around.</p><br/><p>The Gertas charged at him but it was fruitless.</p><br/><p>Chwak!</p><br/><p>Hansoo was cautious to not get any of the blood on his body as he swung the free-form sword around.</p><br/><p>The stretched out blade cut of the neck of the Gerta.</p><br/><p>\u2018Done.\u2019</p><br/><p>Though it would be better if he had the blood of the baby it would take too much time for him to find the hidden baby.</p><br/><p>Since the Quadratus guys will arrive soon.</p><br/><p>Hansoo poured the blood on his free-form sword onto the prepared ingredients and then quickly put in into the by his waist.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s troublesome if the scent gets spread.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo quickly moved his body towards the passed out Gyesoo after he had completed his work.</p><br/><p>He was still passed out.</p><br/><p>And above that Gyesoo, a few Blue Carrier Pigeons were flying around.</p><br/><p>They will arrive if they receive the help from the receiver but since they weren\u2019t receiving the help they didn\u2019t arrive.</p><br/><p>But soon his comrades will arrive.</p><br/><p>Hansoo quickly approached the mess of a guy.</p><br/><p>A guy who had become bloodied from head to toe from the battle with him.</p><br/><p>But the injuries were healing at a rate that could be seen with the naked eye.</p><br/><p>If some more time passes and then he uses the regeneration rune, he\u2019ll probably be healed to the point he\u2019ll be able to move again.</p><br/><p>Hansoo approached the passed out Gyesoo.</p><br/><p>And then he quickly pulled out the mixture he had made, put it into the split wound on his thigh and then quickly shut the wound.</p><br/><p>It will take some time for the gap completely heal.</p><br/><p>And he didn\u2019t have the time wait for that.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s see.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo fumbled around his pockets as he pulled something out.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ll return your business card.\u2019</p><br/><p>As Hansoo stuck the business card which was made of the Padro Larva\u2019s hide onto his thigh, the business card melted down as the wound on the thigh closed up.</p><br/><p>Hansoo, who had made a satisfactory expression at the completely healed wound, nodded and disappeared into the jungle after clearing up his tracks.</p><br/><p>Soon slashing sounds were heard as Cheng, one of the commanders, and his subordinates appeared.</p><br/><p>Cheng made a dumbfounded expression as he looked at Gyesoo laid out on the floor.</p><br/><p>\u2018This retard\u2026 he really lost?\u2019</p><br/><p>Cheng looked at Gyesoo as he was seriously pathetic but then just shook his head.</p><br/><p>He wants to throw Gyesoo into the Kukulja lake after taking into account the fact that Gyesoo had worked so hard was still laid out like this but this guy was a bit special even out of the commanders.</p><br/><p>Since he was a guy who had been inside the Calamity Fish.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take this guy and go back!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Damnit.\u2019</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t want to report this situation to Kalz Morenn\u2026</p><br/><p>He had to wake this guy up no matter what and make him report it himself.</p><br/><p>All the aid was on the cruise ship anyway.</p><br/><p>Cheng took Gyesoo and then quickly moved towards the cruise ship.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm. When does it start.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kalz Morenn looked towards the distant sea with a content expression.</p><br/><p>The Calamity Fish was still quite a distance away but if you take into account his great eyesight and the size of that thing, it wasn\u2019t hard to spot it.</p><br/><p>\u2018The Quadratus guys are quite good.\u2019</p><br/><p>Getting a 2000 man boat was hard enough but these guys somehow managed to station it right next to the root.</p><br/><p>\u2018Anyways. That\u2019s why there are so many tourists.\u2019</p><br/><p>If they had thought that it was dangerous from the start then the tourists wouldn\u2019t even have gathered.</p><br/><p>And a 2000 man boat was at the level where it could withstand the waves created by the Calamity Fish.</p><br/><p>But unlike Kalz Morenn, the newcomer standing next to him, Ailen, was making a rather bitter expression.</p><br/><p>Kalz Morenn chuckled.</p><br/><p>\u2018Look at this kid.\u2019</p><br/><p>He was a guy that he held dearly.</p><br/><p>And that was why he had brought him along after paying the tourism fee.</p><br/><p>Kalz Morenn knew the reason why he was making such an expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been long since you came into our clan right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ailen pondered for a moment and then answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt has been about 27 days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd when did you come to the Otherworld?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ailen shrugged his shoulders</p><br/><p>\u201c1 year. Since I came through the last year\u2019s tutorial.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kalz Morenn smiled contently at those words.</p><br/><p>Only strong people could come into Lighthouse, one of the six pillars.</p><br/><p>But this guy had come into Lighthouse in 1 year and into the most dangerous Shock Troopers.</p><br/><p>If you take into account the fact that most people in Lighthouse were 3rd and 4th years, then this guy\u2019s talent was amazing.</p><br/><p>And that was one of the reasons why he held him so dearly.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s probably because he\u2019s still a 1st year\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Such a thing like this would probably make him feel a little dirty.</p><br/><p>To shove down huge groups of people into the stomach of the Calamity Fish and watching it.</p><br/><p>Kalz Morenn spoke towards Ailen.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou probably know by now\u2026 what do you think of every day while you live?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ailen shrugged his shoulders as he answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cGetting stronger.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kalz Morenn chuckled.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight? Surviving day by day isn\u2019t your goal anymore right? Since you aren\u2019t at that level anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was like you around that level too. But\u2026 you start to think differently right before you go up.\u201d</p><br/><p>There\u2019s nothing he should be scared of right now.</p><br/><p>Since they, who ruled over the Red Zone, were really strong.</p><br/><p>They had long been qualified to go up to the Orange Zone.</p><br/><p>But there was only one reason why they had remained here.</p><br/><p>Of course they won\u2019t start off from the rock bottom.</p><br/><p>Since there was still a gap from those who barely qualified to go up to the Orange Zone and them.</p><br/><p>And they would probably be able to rise above others faster than them.</p><br/><p>But that wasn\u2019t the important part.</p><br/><p>There won\u2019t be people who would tremble at the sight of them and there might be people who he would have to run away from.</p><br/><p>He had to struggle to get stronger again and go back into dangerous places.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know what comes up in your head at this point?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What comes up in your head?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou start to get an idea that you have to rule as much as you get here and then go up.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was hard to remain in one place forever without going up due to the World Tree\u2019s structure.</p><br/><p>And when you become one of the clansmen of the Six Pillars, and the top within that clan, you start to get thoughts such as this.</p><br/><p>But this wasn\u2019t easy either.</p><br/><p>There was no way to fulfill the stomach.</p><br/><p>Since the only thing to eat here were Nutritional Fluids.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t much need for sleep and one would get fed up with lust after a day or two.</p><br/><p>He needed something more fun and intense.</p><br/><p>Something to fulfill this desire of the ones who will go up soon and become tired again.</p><br/><p>And the Quadratus Sightseeing was something created for people like this.</p><br/><p>\u2018I look forward to it.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was quite a good sight to see dying people struggle.</p><br/><p>That alone wouldn\u2019t be enough but there were thousands of people and such a thing would become very grand once the Calamity Fish takes part in it.</p><br/><p>According to the ones who had seen it before, this was really a good sight.</p><br/><p>Shouldn\u2019t he have a look at such a wondrous sight before going up.</p><br/><p>At that moment he felt a presence approach him.</p><br/><p>Then Kalz Morenn clicked his tongue after seeing what had come.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you seriously lose?\u201d</p><br/><p>He had told the other Quadratus guys just in case but for him to really lose.</p><br/><p>While Gyesoo was making an embarrassed face, Kalz Morenn wrinkled his nose at the very faint scent.</p><br/><p>A scent which normal humans could not smell and only he, who had learned , could detect.</p><br/><p>And then he looked towards the origin of the scent.</p><br/><p>Gyesoo\u2019s thigh.</p><br/><p>Kalz Morenn frowned his brows as he looked at Gyesoo with an incredibly fearsome expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou retard\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gyesoo was shocked at the sudden bloodthirst rushing towards him and replied unconsciously.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>Kyaaaak!</p><br/><p>A very faint scent breezed past the noses of the Gertas.</p><br/><p>A scent which was created when the extremely agitated Gerta\u2019s pheromones and blood were mixed.</p><br/><p>It was clear what his scent meant.</p><br/><p>That the killer of one of their kind had been covered with their blood.</p><br/><p>The strong scent, which seemed like it was asking for revenge, was carried by the winds.</p><br/><p>And it was amplified thousands of times.</p><br/><p>Kyaaaak!</p><br/><p>Thousands of Gertas which were roaming near the Kukulja Lake started to madly dash towards the origin of the scent.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo laughed as he saw this sight.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t gain a large amount of time but this was enough for now.</p><br/><p>\u2018I should finish fast and go make some of that Nutritional Fluid. I wonder if that Gyesoo guy is alright.\u2019</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know who Kalz Morenn was but according to what he heard about his personality, it would be hard for him to ignore such a blunder like this.</p><br/><p>Hansoo rushed out to complete the extract within the time that Gyesoo had kindly bestowed him.</p><br/><p>Proofreader\u2019s note</p><br/><p>This is regular chapter 3/3 and the eighth chapter of the week!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

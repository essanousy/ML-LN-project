Anyways, it\u2019s time to end this all I guess.\u2019</p><br/><p>Pektoril laughed as he poured power into the Destruction Jade.</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>Rumble.</p><br/><p>The Destruction Jade, which had been sucking in all the mana, started to aggressively tremble.</p><br/><p>At the same time.</p><br/><p>Rumble.</p><br/><p>The mana pool within their bodies started to create the mana crystals again.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHoo\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The nearby Akalachias exclaimed out in glee.</p><br/><p>The feeling of highly concentrated mana melting around their body and turning into barriers.</p><br/><p>Kwaaaduduk</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s all over now.\u2019</p><br/><p>Pektoril smiled as he felt the Satellite Fortress\u2019s barrier surrounding his body.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Kwadudududuk.</p><br/><p>Karhal cursed out loud after sensing the mana rising up from his body after having smashed an arrow into the head of the final Rebeloong left alive.</p><br/><p>He felt power overflowing through his entire body but it did not feel good at all.</p><br/><p>Since there was only one thing this enormous amount of mana told him.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s all over now.\u2019</p><br/><p>Karhal sighed out loud as he thought of the impending doom of the Satellite Fortresses.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s just take it slow.\u2019</p><br/><p>Pektoril laughed.</p><br/><p>There was no need to rush anymore.</p><br/><p>He just needed to borrow the strength of the Satellite Fortress to erase everyone.</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026Mmm?\u2019</p><br/><p>Something came into Pektoril\u2019s view after his sight had become re-enhanced by the mana.</p><br/><p>A circular door below his feet.</p><br/><p>It was closed like it had usually been.</p><br/><p>But something was different.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026The dust is gone.\u2019</p><br/><p>The dust that had gathered over the giant circular door had disappeared.</p><br/><p>As if it had been swept away by something.</p><br/><p>Pektoril then finally realized something.</p><br/><p>\u2018Did they open this?\u2019</p><br/><p>Pektoril made a dumbfounded expression.</p><br/><p>Actually this was one of the reasons why they wanted to leave this place intact.</p><br/><p>The giant circular door that they had found while searching this entire place after they wiped away the Sages.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t know what the space below was for but this giant door didn\u2019t move even with their tremendous strength.</p><br/><p>They tried to create a hole using the Akion but that was fruitless as well.</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t figure out what this giant hidden storage below this mysterious door was for but it wouldn\u2019t move no matter what.</p><br/><p>Actually the real reason why they hadn\u2019t destroyed this entire structure was because it felt wrong.</p><br/><p>They could\u2019ve destroyed it with the combined efforts of all the Satellite Fortresses but a strong sensation told them that they shouldn\u2019t</p><br/><p>The 1st Generation members of the four races, including the Makrons, thought that there may be something incredibly precious in here so they had a meeting about it.</p><br/><p>And they decided to keep this place a secret temporarily and watch over each other so they don\u2019t do anything stupid.</p><br/><p>Of course the three races felt danger after the Markons disappeared and tried to open this door again but everytime they tried it ended in failure.</p><br/><p>In conclusion, this door and the mysterious space below was left as an unresolved problem.</p><br/><p>But for this door to have opened.</p><br/><p>Then Pektoril made a shocked expression.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026Did that Metiron guy?\u2019</p><br/><p>He was curious as to why he had left behind the Destruction Jade but he was slowly understanding the reason behind it.</p><br/><p>The door that had opened.</p><br/><p>And the Destruction Jade that had been left behind.</p><br/><p>If he had achieved everything he needed to with the Destruction Jade?</p><br/><p>And the Destruction Jade was the key to opening this door?</p><br/><p>\u2018Fuck. Did that guy already take everything in this place!\u2019</p><br/><p>Pektoril touched the small object in his hand.</p><br/><p>And suddenly.</p><br/><p>Clang</p><br/><p>Rumble</p><br/><p>Sounds of something fitting into place and locking on was heard as the giant door started to activate.</p><br/><p>This was the moment he had waited for, the moment in which the door of secret opened up.</p><br/><p>The key to this door was the Destruction Jade like how Pektoril had expected but what filled his mind wasn\u2019t anticipation but nervousness.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hurry. Hurry and open.\u2019</p><br/><p>He had to check the insides.</p><br/><p>And if it was empty he needed to hurry and chase them.</p><br/><p>Chase Metiron and the bugs.</p><br/><p>\u2018No matter what\u2019s in here\u2026 It rightfully belongs to us. How dare he try to take it!\u2019</p><br/><p>Kiiiririririk</p><br/><p>Kuuuugugugooong</p><br/><p>As Pektoril was going insane while glaring at the opening door.</p><br/><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><br/><p>Sounds of something stomping towards him could be heard.</p><br/><p>And Pektoril, with his mana enhanced hearing, could figure out the identity of that sound instantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha. A hero who has massacred the Rebeloongs. But isn\u2019t following us all the way here a bit too brave?\u201d</p><br/><p>Karioram, the warrior standing next to Pektoril, spoke out.</p><br/><p>Of course the scene this guy had shown them was amazing.</p><br/><p>If they didn\u2019t have mana then even they, who were far stronger than the Rebeloongs, wouldn\u2019t be able to handle this guy either.</p><br/><p>The reason why they had ran away in the beginning was because they wouldn\u2019t necessarily be able to win if the humans attacked them.</p><br/><p>\u2018But the situation is much different now.\u2019</p><br/><p>Karioram tapped the blue barrier around his feathers as he smiled.</p><br/><p>Their mana had returned and this guy was alone.</p><br/><p>Hansoo stared at Karioram and the other Akalachias and then clenched the Red Jade in his hand tightly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Red Jade.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo mumbled as he looked at the red colored jade in his hand that had the same form as the Destruction Jade and was only different in color.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t even hidden that well.</p><br/><p>As if they had hidden it in a hurry, this Red Jade was shoved into an air vent in the corner of a research lab.</p><br/><p>If the bodies of the Higher Races were similar to that of humans then it would\u2019ve been found already.</p><br/><p>As the Akalachias were frowning at the red jade in Hansoo\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>Hansoo poured mana into the complementary object, the Red Jade, in his hands.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Kiiiiiiiiiiiing!</p><br/><p>The Akalachias started to back off as they remembered the effects of the Destruction Jade.</p><br/><p>Since they were afraid of their mana, which they had just barely regained, disappearing again.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo spoke towards them as he saw their movement.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Your mana will remain intact.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis will be the final words you hear so remember it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Pektoril was about to retort.</p><br/><p>Kiiiiiiing</p><br/><p>The red light that came out from the Red Jade filled the eyes of the Akalachias.</p><br/><p>At that moment a change occurred.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh\u2026What the\u2026Arrrggh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKiiek!\u201d</p><br/><p>The bright eyes of the Akalachias turned hazy.</p><br/><p>And their mental capabilities to think and judge in their heads disappeared as thoughts of violence and murder replaced them.</p><br/><p>Their primal instincts which have existed since when they had been in the Jungle.</p><br/><p>The beasts of the jungle had finally been able to become a Higher Race after they had received countless surgeries and the mana from the Sages.</p><br/><p>Of course the Sages had a way to reverse the effects.</p><br/><p>The Destruction Jade suppressed their mana.</p><br/><p>And the Red Jade\u2026 Got rid of their sanity.</p><br/><p>\u201cRoaaaarrr!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>The insane Akalachias started to scream out as they looked around.</p><br/><p>And then.</p><br/><p>Booooom!</p><br/><p>Karioram smashed the fellow Akalachia next to him with the golden spear.</p><br/><p>No, they weren\u2019t comrades anymore.</p><br/><p>This was only possible when they were still sane.</p><br/><p>Such a thing had long disappeared and the only thing that had remained was their instincts they had during their solitary days in the jungle.</p><br/><p>The thing that came into their eyes was not comrades but rather competitors who had entered their territory and were even standing right next to them.</p><br/><p>And soon.</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKieeeek!\u201d</p><br/><p>Booom!</p><br/><p>Boooooom! Boom!</p><br/><p>The Akalachias started to smash and slash the others nearby.</p><br/><p>Though they were covered by the mana barrier, their spears and swords were as well.</p><br/><p>The 10m tall giant bodies soon turned into a mess of blood.</p><br/><p>Pektoril was dumbfounded as he saw his underlings go insane and attacking each other as he shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026You crazy bastards! Why are you doing this! Stop!\u201d</p><br/><p>But Pektoril\u2019s shout only stimulated the Akalachias further, it had no other effect.</p><br/><p>\u201cKiiiieeeek!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>The insane Akalachias couldn\u2019t remember Pektoril as they charged in and attacked him as well.</p><br/><p>And Pektoril grinded his teeth as he watched these guys.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026You crazy fucking bastards!\u201d</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t just sit still and take their attacks.</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>Pektoril hurriedly swung his spear and attacked the ones charging towards him.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo frowned as he looked at Pektoril who seemed to still be sane.</p><br/><p>\u2018I guess it doesn\u2019t work against the one who has the Destruction Jade.\u2019</p><br/><p>Maybe it was because it was made in pairs but the black light of the Destruction Jade was slowly pushing away the red light of the Red Jade and was protecting Pektoril.</p><br/><p>\u2018Anyways, I should take that away as well. It wouldn\u2019t be that hard.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo muttered as he looked at Pektoril who had become a mess from fighting with others.</p><br/><p>A tiny entity such as Hansoo wouldn\u2019t come into the eyes of the 10m giants while they battled.</p><br/><p>As if Pektoril, who was acting different from others, was strange to them, the wild Akalachias were being even more aggressive towards Pektoril.</p><br/><p>He just needed to wait until Pektoril became a complete mess and take the Destruction Jade from him.</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>Rumble.</p><br/><p>The giant circular door that had been activating since a while before, started to slowly open.</p><br/><p>And Pektoril, who had been mindlessly fighting back, felt glad.</p><br/><p>\u2018I need to buy time!\u2019</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know what that red jade was but it had no effect on him.</p><br/><p>He would first just hide until the other members of his race killed each other off, come back up when the situation clears up and retrieve the red jade after killing the bug.</p><br/><p>\u2018You fucking bug. Just wait.\u2019</p><br/><p>Pektoril suppressed his rage while clenching his teeth and jumped into the door that had just started to open up.</p><br/><p>Kiiiieeeeeek?</p><br/><p>The Akalachias flinched for a moment as they saw Pektoril jump down but then soon ignored him and started to focus on each other.</p><br/><p>It was more important to fight the ones in front of their eyes than focusing on the one who had left.</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>Pektoril first checked that nobody followed him after he landed tens of meters down below with a loud bang and sighed in relief.</p><br/><p>\u2018Phew\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>And as he realized that he had bought time, curiosity rose up.</p><br/><p>\u2018What\u2026 Could be in here?\u2019</p><br/><p>The precious objects that the Sages, who had the Satellite Fortresses, had hidden away so meticulously.</p><br/><p>It would not be something common.</p><br/><p>It would be much rarer and precious than the Satellite Fortresses.</p><br/><p>\u2018Metiron. If you have it then\u2026You are dead.\u2019</p><br/><p>But Pektoril\u2019s expression turned strange as he looked around.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026The hell.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was indeed something the Sages had risked their lives to save.</p><br/><p>And it didn\u2019t seem like Metiron had taken it.</p><br/><p>But Pektoril could not be happy.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell! Why are they here! What are you guys here!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>A giant space filled with hundreds of thousands of blue containers which were shining extremely brightly.</p><br/><p>And Pektoril screamed out as he saw the Sages frozen asleep within blue containers one by one as if they were dead.</p><br/><p>No Teaser for next chapter, gotta run to class</p><br/>\n</div>"}

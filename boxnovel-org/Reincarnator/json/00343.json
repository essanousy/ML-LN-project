That\u2019s bothering me.\u2019</p><br/><p>Jack continued looking at Hansoo strangely.</p><br/><p>For some reason, he was bothered by Hansoo\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>But he didn\u2019t show it, of course.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m not that much of an amateur.\u2019</p><br/><p>Jack thought.</p><br/><p>He\u2019d realized something after living with a trait that read a person\u2019s emotions.</p><br/><p>That a person needed to be slightly different inwardly and outwardly.</p><br/><p>If their inside thoughts and actual actions were the same, then they lost the barrier that protected them.</p><br/><p>Anyone would be able to read them and guess their next actions and thoughts.</p><br/><p>And he had seen quite a lot of people fall into despair when that happened.</p><br/><p>\u2018Oh well, I guess I\u2019ll be friendly with you too.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cJust a curious thought, why did you just leave? Is it because a weapon like that is useless once you\u2019re that strong?\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t really like hanging out with other men, but there was no harm in becoming acquainted with someone as strong as Hansoo. And so he had asked.</p><br/><p>He was a bit curious too.</p><br/><p>As to why Hansoo had thrown away that weapon.</p><br/><p>Hansoo shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not because of that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018What the hell?\u2019</p><br/><p>As Jack frowned\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014Hansoo smiled and continued to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know what Melchizedek wants?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...No. How could I?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018And how could you?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo had said that the two of them had come from below.</p><br/><p>How could such people know about Melchizedek\u2019s thoughts?</p><br/><p>He only knew one thing about Melchizedek.</p><br/><p>If there weren\u2019t any transcendents around, it would attack them without a single thought.</p><br/><p>From what he\u2019d heard, there were two transcendents that were leagues above others of their kind at the top of the 5th zone.</p><br/><p>If they didn\u2019t exist, then Melchizedek wouldn\u2019t even have suggested an alliance in the first place.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn\u2026 Why did they go up?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cHe wishes to win this battle.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAgainst us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo shook his head.</p><br/><p>He had been able to chat with Melchizedek in the past.</p><br/><p>Before it had become violent.</p><br/><p>When it had still treated humans favorably.</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked towards the sky.</p><br/><p>At a planet, which was countless times larger than this moon. It seemed tiny because it was so far from where they stood.</p><br/><p>He looked at several other moons orbiting around the planet.</p><br/><p>Moons with other races that wouldn\u2019t have made contact with the humans if everything had stayed the same.</p><br/><p>Melchizedek\u2019s enemy was not the humans, but those who lived on that planet.</p><br/><p>And this was probably why he\u2019d asked for an alliance.</p><br/><p>\u2018There is no point in wasting strength against the humans.\u2019</p><br/><p>But the current situation was now the exact opposite.</p><br/><p>Melchizedek and the transcendents were at war.</p><br/><p>And all the transcendents that used to be here had already gone up.</p><br/><p>Which meant one thing.</p><br/><p>One side had agitated the other first, and as a result, they had to fight with all they had.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo could guess who had started this.</p><br/><p>\u2018F***ing Clementine. It\u2019s as if you\u2019d die if you remained still.\u2019</p><br/><p>Kiriel asked again in confusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did they attack Melchizedek? There\u2019s nothing in it for them.\u201d</p><br/><p>At least the abyssal beings gave out crystals\u2014there was nothing to gain from Melchizedek.</p><br/><p>At least from what she knew.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if there\u2019s nothing to take from the other\u2026 if your objectives are the same, then you\u2019re bound to fight sooner or later.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014a huge earthquake had started, causing all nearby objects to tremble vigorously.</p><br/><p>Jack and Kiriel looked around in shock.</p><br/><p>\u2018What the hell is this?\u2019</p><br/><p>As if a heart was beating.</p><br/><p>Vibrations started to occur in rhythmic intervals.</p><br/><p>\u2014boom\u2014boom\u2014boom\u2014boom\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026 Huh?\u2019</p><br/><p>The entire moon trembled to the beat.</p><br/><p>As if something hidden inside was doing its best to escape.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Kiriel thought of the excavation center.</p><br/><p>The machines that were working crazily in an attempt to dig out the object that was hidden inside the moon.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014rumble!\u2014 </p><br/><p>A tremendous earthquake occurred, countless times stronger than the one from before.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhhh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUahh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jack and the others tried their best to maintain their balance.</p><br/><p>A normal earthquake wouldn\u2019t really hurt the few of them who had transcended far past the limits of a human.</p><br/><p>Since even an earthquake measuring a magnitude 6 would only feel like a train passing nearby.</p><br/><p>But this was different.</p><br/><p>It felt as if the entire land itself was going to flip over, and a huge bomb was about to explode beneath them.</p><br/><p>And at that moment\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014crack\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014crackle\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014clang\u2014 </p><br/><p>The ground, which was mostly composed of solid metal, started to crack and split.</p><br/><p>The barrier that was barely maintaining its shape in the sky was ripped apart, completely breaking down.</p><br/><p>The entire colony that had been built upon the moon started to collapse.</p><br/><p>The land itself was transforming.</p><br/><p>As if something that had been rolled up was now stretching itself out.</p><br/><p>\u2018What the f***!\u2019</p><br/><p>Jack cursed inwardly. He\u2019d managed to hold on by embedding his hands and feet into the metal.</p><br/><p>\u2014cruunnchh\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014swooosh\u2014 </p><br/><p>The distant horizon rose up into the sky.</p><br/><p>And the huge, but still round, moon started to uncurl itself.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014boom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Something started to rise up from the city.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhhh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone panicked at seeing the metal spikes rising up from the ground.</p><br/><p>Well, they could only be described as spike-like.</p><br/><p>These so-called \u2018spikes\u2019 were hundreds of meters tall and were spaced out every few kilometers or so.</p><br/><p>Each spike almost resembled a small mountain.</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2018What in the world is going on?!\u2019</p><br/><p>Kiriel freaked out at the huge spike rising up in front of them.</p><br/><p>It was like watching a mountain being born right before your eyes.</p><br/><p>And how can the ground stay intact after a thing like this pops through it?</p><br/><p>The countless artificial metal pieces that had covered the moon had all been shattered and shredded apart, and they were now floating up into the atmosphere.</p><br/><p>Past the now broken-down barrier.</p><br/><p>\u2018We\u2019ll be flung off at this rate!\u2019</p><br/><p>As Kiriel freaked out from seeing her body rising alongside the spikes\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014boom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u201cHold onto this thing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014Hansoo smashed his hand into the rising spike and shouted to the people around him.</p><br/><p>And everyone\u2019s expressions brightened up.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes, that!\u2019</p><br/><p>Although the artificial metal plates may fly up, this spike wouldn\u2019t since it had come from below.</p><br/><p>Everyone brightened up, and they started to smash their hands into the spike as well.</p><br/><p>\u2014crack!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014crunch!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2018Damn\u2026 this is really tough.\u2019</p><br/><p>Jack frowned at the pain in his hand after attempting to smash it into the spike.</p><br/><p>He\u2019d thought he could easily hold on to it since Hansoo\u2019s and Kiriel\u2019s hands had gone through it like it was tofu.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, at least we\u2019re safe for now.\u2019</p><br/><p>Jack sighed in relief as he hung down from the spike which was gradually slowing its ascent.</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014 </p><br/><p>After calming down, he was finally able to look around.</p><br/><p>And this was an amazing place to do it since he was a couple of kilometers in the air.</p><br/><p>\u2018Oh god\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Jack freaked out as he looked around.</p><br/><p>The city that they\u2019d just been in had been shredded apart.</p><br/><p>Of course, how could a city remain intact when the land beneath it had transformed and spread out?</p><br/><p>Plus these spikes.</p><br/><p>The force of these spikes rising up had caused all the remaining mass to fly up into the atmosphere.</p><br/><p>Far past the now ripped-apart barrier.</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014 </p><br/><p>And in the midst of this chaos\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014roaaaaarrr!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014a huge roar rang out throughout the moon.</p><br/><p>Well, throughout the moon-like \u2018thing.\u2019</p><br/><p>Kiriel finally realized what the excavation center had been living on this whole time.</p><br/><p>And exactly what they had worked so hard to dig out.</p><br/><p>\u201c...This isn\u2019t a moon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, it is a weapon though.\u201d</p><br/><p>A giant stingray-shaped monster had uncurled itself and was now flapping its wings, looking poised to traverse through space.</p><br/><p>But it didn\u2019t really look like a natural being.</p><br/><p>If it were, then it wouldn\u2019t have thousands of assault weapons attached to its back.</p><br/><p>\u2018This\u2026 these aren\u2019t spikes.

Ceasefire for a bit! Break time!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCeasefire?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiriel replied while gasping for breath. Elis nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes girl, a ceasefire.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this rate, they would all die.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t know what Melchizedek had done, but it had gained a tremendous power.</p><br/><p>And it was clear where it would direct this strength.</p><br/><p>Melchizedek\u2019s main goal was Angkara, but it would first deal with those who\u2019d kept annoying it up until now.</p><br/><p>In its eyes, they were nothing more than parasites on top of Nelkipa.</p><br/><p>They needed to deal with it before that happened.</p><br/><p>The greatest weapon in Melchizedek\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>The giant creature, Nelkipa.</p><br/><p>They had to crash it or at least damage it to the point where it couldn\u2019t function anymore.</p><br/><p>\u2018That crystal\u2026 If we can blow that crystal up, then it might be possible!\u2019</p><br/><p>Elis Valentine glared towards the crystal and thought:</p><br/><p>If they could succeed in their original plans, then it would be possible.</p><br/><p>If they blew up the crystal\u2014like her and her brother\u2019s original plan\u2014then they would be able to strike a fatal blow onto Nelkipa.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit! Come and help! Unless you want to die here!\u2019</p><br/><p>Guoooooo!</p><br/><p>The bloodthirsty voice of Nelkipa rang throughout the upper areas of its body.</p><br/><p>Like a warning to all those that opposed Melchizedek.</p><br/><p>No, it wasn\u2019t just a warning.</p><br/><p>\u2014kiiiiiiing!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The giant spikes were heating up as they let out bright blue lights.</p><br/><p>As if they were about to fire something at any moment.</p><br/><p>And that wasn\u2019t the only transformation.</p><br/><p>\u2014chiijijijik\u2014 </p><br/><p>Nelkipa\u2019s crystalline skin started to undulate.</p><br/><p>The simply blue crystal-like skin started to fill up with bright blue lights.</p><br/><p>While its skin received a supply of energy, the entire surface of Nelkipa started to undulate.</p><br/><p>No, the skin had something else hidden inside it.</p><br/><p>An aura filled with animosity and bloodthirst.</p><br/><p>The entirety of Nelkipa was preparing itself against Kiriel and Elis.</p><br/><p>As if saying that it would shred them apart as soon as it fully woke up.</p><br/><p>Small bits of flesh had started protruding out from the skin and was changing the overall look of Nelkipa\u2019s surface.</p><br/><p>Spears, swords, or something else that was sharp.</p><br/><p>If it had been ready, this energy would\u2019ve already shredded them apart.</p><br/><p>And this momentum told Elis that it would be stronger than anything she had ever experienced up until now.</p><br/><p>Even her Trait would be nothing before this thing.</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u201cF***\u2026 I\u2019m going to go ahead! Come and help!\u201d</p><br/><p>Elis left behind Kiriel, who was still lost in thought, and she started to shake the energy within the crystal.</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014 </p><br/><p>She was slightly exhausted by the battle, but her Transcendent destruction shook the entire crystal.</p><br/><p>\u2018I must\u2026 end it before it gets fully used to this!\u2019</p><br/><p>But Elis didn\u2019t drop her guard against Kiriel even while she frantically shook the crystal, and she glanced briefly at her.</p><br/><p>And what she saw was a very calm expression.</p><br/><p>No, there was even a hint of indifference.</p><br/><p>\u2018This crazy b****\u2026!\u2019</p><br/><p>She knew that she herself was insane, but shouldn\u2019t their survival take priority?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou crazy b****! Help! We need to survive first! This is the only way we can survive!\u201d</p><br/><p>Elis shouted with rage.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u201cHa...hahahahaha! This is it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Melchizedek screamed out in joy at the sensation it felt from its new body.</p><br/><p>It felt its body and artificial intelligence had fully synchronized and fused.</p><br/><p>As if it had been born with this body from the very beginning.</p><br/><p>\u2018My research did not let me down.\u2019</p><br/><p>The research it had conducted against the aliens and the insect race had shown their results.</p><br/><p>If not for that, it wouldn\u2019t have been able to fully devour this body.</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014 </p><br/><p>The countless ruins.</p><br/><p>Hansoo had destroyed the castle that it had painstakingly built, but Melchizedek could only feel jovial.</p><br/><p>It had created everything for this one goal, and since it had achieved that goal, nothing else mattered anymore.</p><br/><p>These ruins actually made it easier for Melchizedek to move on from its past.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t need any of this trash anymore.</p><br/><p>It now had Nelkipa.</p><br/><p>\u2018Good. Good.\u2019</p><br/><p>Guooooong!</p><br/><p>Melchizedek listened to the cries of this giant creature and made a satisfied expression.</p><br/><p>And beneath Melchizedek\u2019s feet, Nelkipa\u2019s skin continued to roll back and forth.</p><br/><p>The other areas turned sharp and pointy as if it were threatening all other creatures on Nelkipa, but the area around Melchizedek was flat and smooth.</p><br/><p>\u2014pushuk\u2014 </p><br/><p>As if it was welcoming its owner, the area around Melchizedek was soft.</p><br/><p>But Melchizedek\u2019s expression wasn\u2019t quite satisfied.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Maybe not yet.\u2019</p><br/><p>It had originally wanted to turn the surface before its feet into stairs.</p><br/><p>But it seemed like that wasn\u2019t possible just yet.</p><br/><p>It seemed that it would need more time to control this giant creature perfectly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, that doesn\u2019t really matter.\u2019</p><br/><p>Melchizedek smiled coldly as it walked towards Hansoo in the distance.</p><br/><p>\u2014clank\u2014 </p><br/><p>It picked up a piece of rubble nearby and crushed it.</p><br/><p>A fragment of the metal alloy wall that it had painstakingly created.</p><br/><p>The metal alloy, created from seven different metals and was as strong as the walls of the fleet ships, was easily shredded apart like paper.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>Melchizedek laughed as it looked at the broken metal fragments in its hand.</p><br/><p>The alien race\u2019s body strength and hardness were so powerful it was almost ridiculous.</p><br/><p>But this body wouldn\u2019t lose out to the aliens and almost surpassed them.</p><br/><p>\u2018Perfect. Really.\u2019</p><br/><p>Melchizedek was very satisfied.</p><br/><p>It had only taken over this body to control the Nelkipa.</p><br/><p>And that was more than enough.</p><br/><p>What else mattered if it could control this weaponized creature?</p><br/><p>That was why it had relentlessly researched the aliens.</p><br/><p>That was why it had turned Aokan into a bomb and distracted the Kalkuroun Fleet.</p><br/><p>Every force it had created up until now were secondary to the alien race, and it had treated the physical abilities of the Nerpa as secondary aspects as well.</p><br/><p>Since it believed that there was a limit to how strong a lifeform could grow.</p><br/><p>But as it gained this new body and felt its strength.</p><br/><p>It realized.</p><br/><p>Why those aliens trusted in their own strength so much.</p><br/><p>Why they tried so hard to become stronger and gain stronger weapons.</p><br/><p>It understood.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019ve kept giving me presents even until the very end. Thank you, Nerpa.\u2019</p><br/><p>Melchizedek smiled for the original owner of this body who was now long gone and then kicked the ground.</p><br/><p>\u2014boom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The three-meter-tall body of the Nerpa flew into the air and then quickly descended towards Hansoo who had been talking with its hologram.</p><br/><p>\u2014booooooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>A sound that was countless times louder than when it kicked off the ground rang out as it landed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahahaha! Great!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014kiiiing!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Its fist.</p><br/><p>And the hammer that had collided with its fist.</p><br/><p>The shockwave that exploded out from that collision.</p><br/><p>It understood the thrill of having a powerful body.</p><br/><p>It hadn\u2019t known when it lived within the networks.</p><br/><p>The hammer that crushed everything it had created was being pushed back from its fist.</p><br/><p>And that wasn\u2019t all.</p><br/><p>\u2014kududuk!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The Nelkipa\u2019s energy was continuously replenishing itself.</p><br/><p>And Melchizedek\u2019s control over the Nelkipa kept rising.</p><br/><p>These two factors were slowly bringing all of Nelkipa under its complete control.</p><br/><p>The Nelkipa\u2019s skin beneath them started to whirl up and down.</p><br/><p>\u2014pashashashak!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The skin rose up and covered the both of them.</p><br/><p>\u2014tatatang!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The blue wave moving towards Hansoo had shifted into countless spears.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, the blue liquid that shot towards Melchizedek surrounded its body and turned into armor.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha! Let\u2019s end it now!\u201d</p><br/><p>And at Melchizedek\u2019s words\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014tonk!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014Hansoo slammed away a spear and then shrugged.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know about the end or anything, but I know it\u2019s the end for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>At Melchizedek\u2019s confusion, Hansoo thought to himself: </p><br/><p>\u2018Maybe you can\u2019t see it.\u2019</p><br/><p>The blue body that was charging towards him.</p><br/><p>And the letters on its forehead.</p><br/><p>[GIFT]</p><br/><p>Hansoo stared at the clear writings of the fairy on Melchizedek\u2019s forehead.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

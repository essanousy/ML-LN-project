And fought. And fought.</p><br/><p>To escape the worst-case scenario.</p><br/><p>But as death quickly approached her, she realized that it wasn\u2019t quite what she expected.</p><br/><p>\u2018...It\u2019s actually quite nice.\u2019</p><br/><p>She could finally rest.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t have to fight anymore.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t have to kill anymore.</p><br/><p>She had fought too long.</p><br/><p>Twenty years since she had come to this place.</p><br/><p>And fifteen years stuck in that dream.</p><br/><p>She had fought for thirty-five years and struggled to climb up.</p><br/><p>She deserved to rest a little, right?</p><br/><p>She had struggled for thirty-five years, no, twenty years excluding the dream, so nobody would say anything if she said she wanted to rest.</p><br/><p>\u2018Nice\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin weakly turned her head and looked next to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy\u2026 did you help me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ares Valentine, who also had his insides destroyed from the crystal, smiled at her as he lied down in a similar fashion.</p><br/><p>He also didn\u2019t know why he\u2019d done it.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well. It\u2019s not half-bad\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Ares, who had been trying to figure out his complicated feelings, looked at Enbi Arin\u2019s profile and smiled.</p><br/><p>Although the method was a bit different, he was going to \u2018go up and rest\u2019 now.</p><br/><p>\u201c...\u201d.</p><br/><p>Ares Valentine\u2019s eyes lost their light and slowly closed.</p><br/><p>And Enbi Arin, who had been looking at Ares in silence, turned around towards Hansoo who had almost arrived and smiled.</p><br/><p>\u2018Thanks to you\u2026 I\u2019ve had a busy life.\u2019</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin thought of the dream Melchizedek had given her.</p><br/><p>In it, she had truly been happy.</p><br/><p>Taking over the seven zones and pushing back the Abyss.</p><br/><p>Nobody could handle their power, and those precious to them were no longer killed.</p><br/><p>Maybe it was a bit too perfect.</p><br/><p>A bit too happy.</p><br/><p>And if she really cared about her life and hadn\u2019t suppressed the crystal.</p><br/><p>The scene in her dreams wouldn\u2019t have been possible.</p><br/><p>\u2018Too bad I won\u2019t be able to accompany you.\u2019</p><br/><p>She wouldn\u2019t be able to follow them, but it didn\u2019t matter.</p><br/><p>There was somebody else who would achieve it for her.</p><br/><p>Although it was only a dream for her.</p><br/><p>Hansoo would be able to turn it into reality.</p><br/><p>\u2018I wish you the best of luck on the 6th floor as well\u2026 Work for my share too.

Time to hurry. There\u2019s no time. Come on, you hunk of metal.\u201d</p><br/><p>N-Aroel complained to the giant ship, mumbling as he looked at Angkara in the far distance.</p><br/><p>He had lost his legacy</p><br/><p>He could not lose the flame as well.</p><br/><p>The faster he was, the better.</p><br/><p>\u2018And from what I heard\u2026 those aliens are there as well.\u2019</p><br/><p>He\u2019d heard that the aliens were there.</p><br/><p>Either hiding in secret or out in the open.</p><br/><p>N-Aroel nodded as he remembered something.</p><br/><p>\u2018Right. It\u2019s called the 6th Zone, right?\u2019</p><br/><p>N-Aroel, who had been thinking while looking at Angkara, suddenly looked down at Nelkipa and smiled.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, if fate allows it, then we\u2019ll meet again. Anyway, thanks for this time around. Everything was resolved with ease. See you next time, maybe.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014kuoooooo!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The Kalkuroun fleet started to move towards Angkara at full speed.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

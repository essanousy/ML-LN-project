(1)</p><br/><p>Booooom!</p><br/><p>The blue light surrounding Hantae\u2019s body ruthlessly clashed with Hansoo\u2019s dark golden reinforcement.</p><br/><p>Kududududuk</p><br/><p>\u2018Tsk. Though it\u2019s only a game the higher race bastards made\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo shook his head as he felt the mana reinforcement of his Demonic Dragon\u2019s Reinforcement being shaken quite a bit.</p><br/><p>Though this Hantae guy was quite strong, he was nowhere strong enough to even crack the Demonic Dragon\u2019s Reinforcement surrounding his body.</p><br/><p>But if he has the dog collar of the Arucon race, Blue Jade, the story changes a bit.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>It bestowed upon a tremendous amount of mana and power onto the user.</p><br/><p>But at the same time that person will have made a slave contract.</p><br/><p>Since they would need to live for the higher race the moment they decide to live their life as a hunting dog.</p><br/><p>There were 3 ways to escape the fate of a hunting dog.</p><br/><p>Dying, not being able to fill up their quota and getting dragged to the birdcage or making another hunting dog.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well. It seems he\u2019s quite content with his status as a hunting dog.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked at Hantae who was clashing around with him while making an extremely joyous expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cUahahahaha! You\u2019re next Altair! I\u2019ll play with you for a bit before I send you! You\u2019ll need to fill up the void of Elis as well!\u201d</p><br/><p>As he had heard, the time limit for filling up all 10 people was 2 weeks.</p><br/><p>There was no need to fill them all up right away.</p><br/><p>Altair grinded her teeth while listening to this from the distance where she was throwing skills at him.</p><br/><p>They had heard his talk about the higher race so much to the point they\u2019d gotten fed up with it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like you\u2019re quite content with being somebody\u2019s bitch since you were already a bitch to begin with.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUahahaha! What about it! People need to adapt and act accordingly to the situation! Of course there\u2019s a chance that humans are slaves when the whole Otherworld is screwed up!\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a stronger race than the humans.</p><br/><p>What about it?</p><br/><p>Even in a society where only humans existed, there were ups and downs in authorities.</p><br/><p>Like the predators above him in the Orange Zone, Gwanje or Enbi Arin.</p><br/><p>\u2018Nothing changed.\u2019</p><br/><p>Which made everything simpler.</p><br/><p>Go up as much as one could go up.</p><br/><p>\u2018What if I\u2019m a dog?\u2019</p><br/><p>People who lived well under rules still lived well.</p><br/><p>The exit always exists.</p><br/><p>And being a pig or a dog with a full stomach was better than a hungry human anyway.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo shook his head at Hantae\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes you can be a slave. But there\u2019s no need to follow it that resolutely.\u201d</p><br/><p>A world where humans acted as slaves.</p><br/><p>He was going to flip this world around.</p><br/><p>He would then take the origins of the strength of the higher race and give it to the humans.</p><br/><p>Like how Prometheus gifted humans with fire.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s end this.\u2019</p><br/><p>He read out the code.</p><br/><p>There was no need to drag things out any further.</p><br/><p>And in the next instant the black clouds expanded out and surrounded Hansoo\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u201cUuuk?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hantae, who had flinched for a moment, soon realized that nothing had happened to himself and was about to smirk.</p><br/><p>\u2018Did he even do anything? Kuhehehe.\u2019</p><br/><p>But Hantae couldn\u2019t actually laugh.</p><br/><p>Since the blue light that was surrounding his body had disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh??? Huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hantae was extremely confused as he looked at his own body.</p><br/><p>The Blue Jade\u2019s powders that surrounded Hantae\u2019s body which were the origins for the blue light.</p><br/><p>All these powders had turned black.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastard! What have you done!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo stared at the Blue Jade powders that had turned black from the Dark Cloud at those words.</p><br/><p>The Blue Jade was in the end a tool and a machine.</p><br/><p>So it could be infected by the Dark Cloud.</p><br/><p>It took a bit of work since the code was a bit complex but figuring it out during the fight wasn\u2019t that hard.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s not time for me to go against the Hunter races yet.\u2019</p><br/><p>So there was a need to deceive them.</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>\u201cKuaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hantae\u2019s body had been smashed by Hansoo\u2019s kick and had been flung off.</p><br/><p>To where Altair and the others were at.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>And there were countless kicks which had greeted him.</p><br/><p>Smack! Smack!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastard. Say it again! For me to call you our fucking vice-captain!\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the shock trooper members was kicking Hantae without holding back.</p><br/><p>He was somebody who had followed Hantae\u2019s words more than those of Altair\u2019s.</p><br/><p>But he was currently extremely enraged at the enmity that Hantae had showed them.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh\u2026You bastards\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hantae moved his body in order to resist but he didn\u2019t have the power to do so after losing the power of the Blue Jade and being hit by Hansoo.</p><br/><p>And even more so since he had been surrounded by 9 people.</p><br/><p>While the ten people solved their issues with each other, Hansoo had focused all his senses onto the Dark Cloud.</p><br/><p>Well, actually at the Blue Jade powders that the Dark Cloud had devoured.</p><br/><p>\u2018I need to hurry and send the signal.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hoooooong</p><br/><p>The black powder that had been floating around Hantae\u2019s body got sucked onto the top of Hansoo\u2019s hand and turned into a marble form.</p><br/><p>The extremely bright light was nowhere to be seen and instead there was an extremely black marble, which looked like it could devour anything.</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked over this marble for a bit and then used the Dark Cloud to send a signal.</p><br/><p>A fake signal saying that the Hunting Dog was doing well.</p><br/><p>Though it was very simple, it was more than enough to fool them.</p><br/><p>\u2018They shouldn\u2019t really be caring about one to two Hunting Dogs.\u2019</p><br/><p>The Blue Jade was nothing but them playing around.</p><br/><p>Against the newbies who had just come up.</p><br/><p>Though the number of people who got dragged to the Birdcage was tremendous from this.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well since they don\u2019t kill them right away\u2026They can wait for a bit.\u2019</p><br/><p>Rescuing the people caught in the Birdcage was work for another time.</p><br/><p>Hansoo pocketed the infected Blue Jade, the Black Jade now, into his possession.</p><br/><p>Since he would need to use this in the future.</p><br/><p>Hansoo thought of his next destination as he pocketed the Black Jade.</p><br/><p>Ceasefire Village.</p><br/><p>One of the villages that lived between the races and balanced each sides.</p><br/><p>He would start the fire that would devour everything from there.</p><br/><p>\u2018According to the Kali-Crown\u2019s memories, traces of humans are within two days worth of travel.\u2019</p><br/><p>But it was hard to find the location of the village even with the Kali-Crown.</p><br/><p>Since the villages were located in places where it was hard to find them as well as having lots of mechanisms to hide them as well.</p><br/><p>He would need to follow the signs in order to find the village.</p><br/><p>Traces that could not be found with senses but only with search skills.</p><br/><p>Signs that could be followed with the senses had a chance to drag in beasts as well.</p><br/><p>Signs that were designed to drive away the beasts and drag in the humans.</p><br/><p>\u2018A search skill\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked towards Altair in the distance who was beating the hell out of Hantae.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>Altair touched the extremely small gem embedded within the tree and activated a skill.</p><br/><p>Kiiiiiing</p><br/><p>The gem, which was linked to a search skill, showed Altair the location of the next gem.</p><br/><p>\u2018Amazing. So the village will come out if we follow it like this right?\u2019</p><br/><p>If there weren\u2019t any gems like this then they wouldn\u2019t even have known about the existence of the village.</p><br/><p>The gem had showed the direction of the village as well as an overview of the village.</p><br/><p>As if it wanted to be found as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>\u2018Phew\u2026 I really want to find it fast.\u2019</p><br/><p>Altair made a tired expression while walking.</p><br/><p>Usually she would\u2019ve been suspicious of the gem which was luring in the humans in an extremely direct way over and over.</p><br/><p>But she didn\u2019t even have the chance to do that anymore.</p><br/><p>Since this damned jungle didn\u2019t give anybody a time to rest.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn. It\u2019s coming again!\u2019</p><br/><p>Altair grinded her teeth after sensing something in her detection area and then shouted out.</p><br/><p>\u201cThree O\u2019Clock! Just one this time!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo clenched his fists tightly at Altair\u2019s warning.</p><br/><p>\u2018As I thought, I do need at least one detection-type skill.\u2019</p><br/><p>He had gained a physique that was strong beyond the imaginations of normal people with the Demonic Dragon\u2019s Reinforcement, Body Enhancement Surgery and the Dragon Essence Blade.</p><br/><p>But of course there was a difference between Hansoo, who couldn\u2019t use any detection-type skills, and Altair, somebody who had polished the detection skill of a scout team to the extremes, in terms of their detection range.</p><br/><p>Hansoo lifted up his Forked Lightning and threw it into the midst of the jungle.</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>Roarr!</p><br/><p>The very loud sound of an explosion was heard from the depths of the jungle.</p><br/><p>At the same time something enraged rushed out from that jungle.</p><br/><p>Altair grinded her teeth as she looked at the giant lion-shaped beast which was charging at them.</p><br/><p>The attacks of the beasts were becoming more and more frequent the deeper they went in.</p><br/><p>As if they were proving that the area she and her group roamed in for 3 weeks was nothing.</p><br/><p>It might\u2019ve been different if they had a lot of people but this was not something that ten of them could go through.</p><br/><p>\u2018If this guy wasn\u2019t here then we would\u2019ve been long dead already.\u2019</p><br/><p>In return for them showing him the way, he would accompany them until the village.</p><br/><p>This was the agreement.</p><br/><p>But no matter how much Altair thought about it logically, there should not be somewhere where people lived in a place like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cUntil when are they going to keep popping out! Can people really live in a place like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Altair shouted out in anger.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026It exists.\u201d</p><br/><p>Altair stared at the city that was standing in the direction the final gem was pointing towards in a daze and muttered to herself.</p><br/><p>They had walked through valleys and waterfalls and continued to walk.</p><br/><p>Around the time the attacks of the beasts had started to lessen, the hidden village had appeared in front of them.</p><br/><p>Extremely tall fences and a gate made of wood that were at least 30m tall.</p><br/><p>Altair\u2019s expression brightened up as she saw the giant village that was between the size of a large town and a small city.</p><br/><p>They had finally escaped this damned jungle where they couldn\u2019t find even a single trace of humans and had arrived at somewhere that they could live at.</p><br/><p>But Altair\u2019s expression turned slightly dark.</p><br/><p>Along with the members of the group behind her.</p><br/><p>They had searched for humans from the anxiousness they had felt due to not being able to see a trace of humans but once they had found it numerous thoughts that had been buried away started to make their way into their heads again.</p><br/><p>That the people of the Otherworld were not as friendly to other humans as those in the real world.</p><br/><p>In some cases they were even more dangerous than humans.</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>Hansoo walked out from the group and made his way towards the Village.</p><br/><p>Altair pondered for a moment at Hansoo\u2019s sudden actions but then also moved towards the village.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yeah, there shouldn\u2019t be that much of a problem. My danger sensors aren\u2019t really telling me anything either so\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>And the fact that Hansoo was next to them made them feel a lot more at ease.</p><br/><p>Muffled sounds.</p><br/><p>As they got closer, the outpost tower located on the top of the fence got noisy.</p><br/><p>\u2018Mmm?\u2019</p><br/><p>Altair used her skills and tried to listen on to what they were saying but she couldn\u2019t for some reason.</p><br/><p>But one thing was clear.</p><br/><p>That they didn\u2019t have any enmity against them.</p><br/><p>\u2018No, it\u2019s more like welcoming us.\u2019</p><br/><p>Soon a rope ladder had been thrown down from the top of the fences.</p><br/><p>And then a loud shout was heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome up with that!\u201d</p><br/><p>Altair\u2019s pride was a bit hurt at this.</p><br/><p>Why the hell would they use a rope ladder to climb a fence that was merely 30m tall.</p><br/><p>\u2018Are they looking down on us because we\u2019re newbies?\u2019</p><br/><p>Altair focused her powers into her feet.</p><br/><p>And then activated , a necessary skill for the scout team that made one\u2019s body lighter.</p><br/><p>Booom!</p><br/><p>The lightened body of Altair easily jumped up the 30m tall fence and landed on the space above the fences.</p><br/><p>Same with the rest of the group.</p><br/><p>Somebody clapped as they saw this.</p><br/><p>Clap clap clap.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems I\u2019ve underestimated the newbies a bit too much, Hahahahaha! Anyways, welcome! Finally newcomers after a whole month!\u201d</p><br/><p>Altair looked towards the person who had thrown the rope ladder to them from above the outpost tower.</p><br/><p>Though he was a bit small in stature, the tightly packed muscles all over his body told them that his life wasn\u2019t an easy one.</p><br/><p>His eyes were actually shining like the eyes of a tiger as well.</p><br/><p>The man looked towards Altair and shouted out loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWelcome to the Oasis you baby chicks. I am Karim, the captain of the guards here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Karim looked over at the guards who were on a watch from above the fences, turned back to Altair and her group and smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve worked hard to get here. Now now. Since you\u2019ve reached here, let me tour you around the village. Amazing right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Karim then pointed towards to the village that was inside the fence.</p><br/><p>And a sense of pride could be felt in that Karim\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u2018How much could it possibly\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Altair took a glance at the village inside the fence because she had gotten curious from Karim\u2019s expression.</p><br/><p>Numerous buildings that were made of wood.</p><br/><p>Altair\u2019s expression brightened up as she saw a decent looking market along with a plaza.</p><br/><p>The buildings weren\u2019t important actually.</p><br/><p>The important thing was the attitude of the people.</p><br/><p>There were smiles on the expressions of people and they were full of vigor.</p><br/><p>Which means that the people here were feeling quite at home and stable.</p><br/><p>\u2018Wow\u2026This is indeed worthy of being proud. This much is amazing.\u2019</p><br/><p>Altair nodded.</p><br/><p>Their pride was worthy enough just from being able to create such a village in the middle of the jungle where countless beasts roamed around.</p><br/><p>As Altair sighed in relief as she took a step into a place where it was full of people\u2019s scents, Hansoo also nodded while looking around the surroundings.</p><br/><p>Numerous items entered Hansoo\u2019s vision from the market.</p><br/><p>He would be able to save more time with this.</p><br/><p>\u2018Finish my preparation in here.\u2019</p><br/><p>Karim clapped as he saw Hansoo and Altair and then pointed to the inner parts.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell. Let\u2019s move on from the chit chat now. Let\u2019s talk about the details after we get in. Since the outpost isn\u2019t really the greatest place to have a conversation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Altair looked towards Hansoo and spoke back to Karim\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do? Are you going to stick with us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Karim smiled as he looked at Altair.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t work the way you want it to work.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Altair made a nervous expression, Karim chuckled as he spoke again.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be scared. I\u2019m saying that the living quarters of the newbies are set separately. Come this way. Just calm down and rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPhew\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Altair sighed in relief.</p><br/><p>A new space.</p><br/><p>She could only feel nervous at this point but the atmosphere here didn\u2019t seem really bad.</p><br/><p>Too good for a place like the Otherworld.</p><br/><p>But Altair shook her head as well as these thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yeah, since the humans aren\u2019t the owners of this world they might be combining their forces\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Combining their strength was obvious if they had a common enemy.</p><br/><p>\u2018Not fighting with each other\u2026 Is already much better.\u2019</p><br/><p>Altair\u2019s expression turned much brighter.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>An extremely beautiful woman was listening to a man\u2019s report from the deepest part of the village.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou say newcomers have come?\u201d</p><br/><p>A woman whose striking features was her blonde hair and red eyes.</p><br/><p>Karim, who had welcomed Altair and her group before, nodded at the question of the leader of the village located in the safe zone, Ekidu.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a relief. There wasn\u2019t much time left until the offering but for them to come in at the right time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ekidu frowned at these words.</p><br/><p>\u2018Until when are we going to\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Ekidu made a tired expression as she sunk into her chair.</p><br/><p>And Karim urged as he looked at that Ekidu.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t the time to ponder. The tremendous amount of newcomers has stopped coming in since 3 weeks ago. Are you thinking of sending us, who have stayed here for over a year and fought with the beasts? Us who have fought with you? Instead of the newcomers who have just come in?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo not forget. As to how the peace in this town is being sustained.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ekidu nodded with a heavy expression at those words.</p><br/><p>Since all of that was correct.</p><br/><p>\u2018I need to buy time.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026How long do we have? Until we have to send the offerings?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne week. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll take care of it all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Karim finished with those words and moved outside.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

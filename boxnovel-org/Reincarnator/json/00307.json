Don\u2019t let your guard down.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Lauren, who had been barely standing, frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck...Then when can we rest! Do you only have thoughts of killing and fighting in your head?\u201d</p><br/><p>And Hansoo replied in a simple manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was only one moment in this world that allowed you to stop thinking about fighting.</p><br/><p>Only a single moment.</p><br/><p>\u2018Death\u2019</p><br/><p>If you have not reached the state of eternal rest then you have to keep fighting.</p><br/><p>Because you were alive.</p><br/><p>This was the price of staying alive.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Whooosh.</p><br/><p>A golden ball of light came out from Hansoo\u2019s fingers and flew towards Lauren.</p><br/><p>Well, past her body to be exact.</p><br/><p>The golden energy exploded out behind Lauren.</p><br/><p>Along with a scream.</p><br/><p>Kyaaaaaak!</p><br/><p>\u201c....Kang Kion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Misun and Taesung were at a loss for words when they saw the parts of the creature flying out from the explosion.</p><br/><p>It had sneaked past Lauren and had approached herself who had an injury to the ankle.</p><br/><p>If that damned bastard hadn\u2019t found it and destroyed it first then it would\u2019ve succeeded in taking her life.</p><br/><p>Hansoo shrugged her shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to worry then not doing so is also a good choice, those things will help you stop thinking about such things. Forever that is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...Damn.\u201d</p><br/><p>Misun then spoke towards Hansoo quietly.</p><br/><p>\u201c...I\u2019ll repay you. Tell me if you need anything at the main base. I\u2019ll get it or you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Misun then kept up her guard while treating her injuries and headed towards her comrades.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo smiled at this scene.</p><br/><p>\u2018At least I won\u2019t have to tell her about one thing.\u2019</p><br/><p>There was another reason to reduce the amount worry one had about fights.</p><br/><p>That is finding comrades to worry about it together.</p><br/><p>And it seemed like they were doing this well anyway.</p><br/><p>\u2018I wonder how they\u2019re all doing.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo thought back to the comrades from 2 years ago but then shook his head.</p><br/><p>If they were doing well then he would meet them while climbing up the tower.</p><br/><p>\u2018Anyways, the Echiton-Filers are only 3rd grade monsters. Were the monsters that were released only at this level?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo mumbled.</p><br/><p>Echiton-Filers</p><br/><p>A hierarchy type race, though they were dangerous they didn\u2019t have outstanding skills and had limited strength so they were rated as 3rd grade.</p><br/><p>Dark-Ramas.</p><br/><p>Self ruled race type, they were far beyond 5th grade if one wasn\u2019t prepared but if one was sufficiently prepared then they were even lower than Echiton-Filers at 2nd grade.</p><br/><p>And Kang-Kion were rated 4th grades as they were hard to deal with even if you knew how to deal with them.</p><br/><p>All the abyssal races he had seen up to this point were quite weak.</p><br/><p>Though Taesang the 3 others didn\u2019t speak for everyone in the 4th zone, he was still shocked at their lack of sense.</p><br/><p>But if all the abyssal races were around this level, then it wouldn\u2019t be weird.</p><br/><p>While Hansoo had been lost in thought.</p><br/><p>A voice was heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re almost there. Right past that hill.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked towards the location where Taesan had been pointing towards.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo made a shocked expression.</p><br/><p>\u2018...That is.\u2019</p><br/><p>The place these guys decided to hide was not far from War Fortress.</p><br/><p>It was a similar distance away from the Great Maze as the War Fortress of the Keil Kingdom was.</p><br/><p>The Korin Kingdom\u2019s Fortress.</p><br/><p>Though it was still dozens of kilometers away from the War Fortress, it was not a long distance for that Dark King.</p><br/><p>And as if Taesang had read Hansoo\u2019s mind, he replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if we want to go far, there are just too many abyssal creatures so we cannot go far. And...This is the only way to recruit even a small amount of people who come up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd for some reason, the abyssal creatures don\u2019t come to that place. It\u2019s the safest spot.\u201d</p><br/><p>If you ignore that crazy bastard, then the most dangerous thing were the abyssal creatures.</p><br/><p>Since the crazy bastard is holed up in the War Fortress for some reason, the safest spot was anywhere where the abyssal creatures didn\u2019t come to.</p><br/><p>Like this fortress.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo frowned.</p><br/><p>\u2018They don\u2019t approach it.\u2019</p><br/><p>Of course the abyssal creatures weren\u2019t everywhere.</p><br/><p>But they would go anywhere the humans went.</p><br/><p>There weren\u2019t many exceptions to this and far less of them were beneficial to humans.</p><br/><p>Hansoo clenched the golden spear in his hand.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>Rummble.</p><br/><p>As Hansoo approached.</p><br/><p>He could feel the auras within the Fortress.</p><br/><p>Thousands of well-organized auras.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo frowned.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s too loose.\u2019</p><br/><p>The aura of a person didn\u2019t only tell how strong one was.</p><br/><p>It also showed their current condition as well as their emotions.</p><br/><p>And it became even more apparent if the opposing side was weaker.</p><br/><p>Though they were well organized, they were also very relaxed.</p><br/><p>And Misun spoke in an embarrassed manner after seeing Hansoo\u2019s expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be like that. It\u2019s because we almost gathered enough of the Abyssal Crystals.\u201d</p><br/><p>Abysstal Crystals.</p><br/><p>In the beginning, this crystal which dropped from the abyssal creatures, brought huge battles in the beginning because of its mysteriousness.</p><br/><p>Since there was nothing that didn\u2019t have a meaning after a fight in this world.</p><br/><p>They thought that it could make them stronger as they madly chased after it.</p><br/><p>Until they found out that it didn\u2019t have any effects of making them stronger.</p><br/><p>But despite that, it was still one of the most important resources of this world.</p><br/><p>Since this was the only thing that allowed the elevators to activate.</p><br/><p>Only when they had a sufficient amount per person could they go up.</p><br/><p>This was why they had to continue fighting against the Abyssal Creatures.</p><br/><p>Since if not, they would have to remain in this world.</p><br/><p>And the four leaders who had escaped with their respective groups made a decision.</p><br/><p>To go up.</p><br/><p>Though there were higher chances of danger, they had hopes in another factor.</p><br/><p>The people who went before.</p><br/><p>There were over 10 million people who had went up in the past two years.</p><br/><p>And everybody agreed to this.</p><br/><p>Since that Dark King was too much for them to continue staying here.</p><br/><p>A natural disaster should be dodged.</p><br/><p>Misun turned around and glanced at the man.</p><br/><p>\u2018...I hope things go well.\u2019</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t monkeys.</p><br/><p>It was 99% clear that this man was a transcendent as well.</p><br/><p>They could feel the traces of transcendent aura from time to time.</p><br/><p>The issue was the people inside the fortress.</p><br/><p>The people inside were deathly afraid of transcendents.</p><br/><p>None of them wanted to befriend a transcendent.</p><br/><p>Misun carefully spoke towards hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould you just stay here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Misun nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201c...There\u2019s no need to create issues right? Your objective was the box anyway. We\u2019ll get it for you after we go in.\u201d</p><br/><p>They had been dragged here because of fear and relief at the fact that the man didn\u2019t treat them half badly.</p><br/><p>But she woke up after seeing the fortress.</p><br/><p>There was a high chance of issues occurring if they took this man inside the War Fortress.</p><br/><p>They just needed to give back the box.</p><br/><p>According to her thoughts, this man had nothing to do with them as long as they gave back the box.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Whoooosh.</p><br/><p>Something cut through the air and headed towards them rapidly.</p><br/><p>\u2018What the...No way!\u2019</p><br/><p>Misun looked up to see if it was an attack.</p><br/><p>But it wasn\u2019t a weapon that she saw.</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>The object which had been thrown made a huge noise as it landed on the ground.</p><br/><p>Hansoo picked up the object as he chuckled.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems I\u2019ve gotten it back a bit too easily.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Too easily.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo picked up the box and looked towards the man who was looking at him with a stern expression.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

To revive my race.\u201d</p><br/><p>Out there in the vast space.</p><br/><p>Even he didn\u2019t know what had happened to his race that called multiple planets their home.</p><br/><p>His race might have even moved on to other unknown planets.</p><br/><p>But since he had now lost the Nelkipa.</p><br/><p>He had to assume that his race had been annihilated and had to start anew in this place.</p><br/><p>And to do that\u2026</p><br/><p>He needed enough strength that could then become the seed of their race\u2019s revival.</p><br/><p>\u2018Reviving one\u2019s race\u2026 Quite similar.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo smirked.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, but I also need that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked at the ships rising up in the distance as he spoke.</p><br/><p>The giant ships that were visible to an average person\u2019s eyes despite being thousands of kilometers away.</p><br/><p>Despite the distance, one could still feel the vibrations within the air from their movements.</p><br/><p>But whether they had noticed the change in this place and started to move\u2026</p><br/><p>Or were moving to kill the now awakened monsters\u2026</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know why they were all rising up into the air, but he knew one thing for sure.</p><br/><p>That he needed the crystal to go against them.</p><br/><p>The Nerpa pondered for a moment and suggested:</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about this\u2014let\u2019s form an alliance for now. We do not need to fight each other. Our opponents are the Pompeion Empire and the Neropa Union, right? If we fight together, then we can deal with them with much more ease.\u201d</p><br/><p>He needed to gather three controllers.</p><br/><p>Even if Hansoo didn\u2019t exist, there were countless other obstacles.</p><br/><p>And it was hard to use the crystal\u2019s full strength at this moment as well.</p><br/><p>There was no point in fighting each other.</p><br/><p>Hansoo thought for a moment but then nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot a bad plan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. Then\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>But as the Nerpa spoke with a bright expression\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014Hansoo added a few extra words.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I will look after the crystal.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Nerpa frowned at this.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you not trust me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Their race held promises and honor very highly.</p><br/><p>His words were basically saying that he did not trust him, so he wanted to hold onto the item of importance.</p><br/><p>Hansoo smirked as he replied:</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you trust me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat will you do if I decide to betray you at a crucial moment while holding onto that?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Nerpa pondered for a moment and shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>He could actually see another person\u2019s soul to a degree.</p><br/><p>This man\u2019s soul was rough, cracked in multiple places, and distorted in one place.</p><br/><p>But it was still letting out a pure light.</p><br/><p>It was a soul that only someone who still retained themselves could have, despite receiving and giving countless injuries.</p><br/><p>Someone like this did not lie or betray easily.</p><br/><p>Since they worked for the greater picture and not for their own benefit.</p><br/><p>Hansoo chuckled.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if I have to betray you to save my race? What do you think I will do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn another way, what if you had to betray me to achieve your goals\u2026 What will you do?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Nerpa\u2019s expression turned sour, and Hansoo continued to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have too much on our shoulders to put our trust in each other, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>They were in a situation where they had to work for the survivability of their respective races.</p><br/><p>They were just like each other.</p><br/><p>Friendships and trust were nothing before the weight they bore on their shoulders.</p><br/><p>The worst-case scenario.</p><br/><p>If they had to give up their allies to achieve their goals.</p><br/><p>If they had to betray their allies and attack them from the back to save their race.</p><br/><p>What would he and the Nerpa choose?</p><br/><p>And they knew that such a situation would come sooner or later.</p><br/><p>\u2018The Nerpa\u2019s race\u2026 Their scale is too large.\u2019</p><br/><p>They would have a goal that would fit their scale.</p><br/><p>Which meant that the would not be enough.</p><br/><p>At least, not for both races.</p><br/><p>The Nerpa grinded his teeth as he shouted:</p><br/><p>\u201cExtreme\u2026 you are too extreme! You are planning to make an enemy out of me because of an unknown future? Me that could be of great strength to you? I thought you were a great person, but you\u2019re just a coward!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo spoke coldly:</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the issue.\u201d</p><br/><p>People who can greatly contribute to one\u2019s strength...</p><br/><p>They would become great enemies the moment one\u2019s back was turned.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe if you and I both had a few things to lose, but\u2026 we have nothing to lose\u201d.</p><br/><p>They only had their bodies.</p><br/><p>They had no race to save, no hostages to rescue.</p><br/><p>Nothing.</p><br/><p>Hansoo thought of Keldian\u2019s words and tightly clenched his hammer.</p><br/><p>\u2018Maybe\u2026 I am a coward.\u2019</p><br/><p>His enemy was too great.</p><br/><p>He could not allow the item that could become the largest variable remain in the hands of the person that could become the largest variable.</p><br/><p>He needed to kill the Nerpa when he was still weak.</p><br/><p>And as if the Nerpa had read Hansoo\u2019s thoughts, his expression turned cold.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems you are underestimating me, but\u2026 sure. Let\u2019s have a go at it.\u201d</p><br/><p>His choice to fight Hansoo wasn\u2019t because Hansoo was going against him.</p><br/><p>There was always the choice of running away.</p><br/><p>But as he heard Hansoo\u2019s words\u2026 </p><br/><p>He had to admit the feeling he\u2019d been burying inside him.</p><br/><p>If both races were after the Flame\u2019s strength, they would collide sooner or later.</p><br/><p>And to prevent that collision, he needed to get rid of Hansoo.</p><br/><p>He had clearly seen the alien race\u2019s terrifying potential for growth.</p><br/><p>And the man before him was a person at the epitome of that race.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2026 will uproot you here.\u2019</p><br/><p>If not then he would return in the future with much more power.</p><br/><p>And then\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble!\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014with its limitations removed, the power of the Flame started to rise up from the Nerpa\u2019s soul, who had the rights to control such power.</p><br/><p>\u2014oooong!\u2014</p><br/><p>Buried deep within the planet, the Flame\u2019s core trembled as it supplied the Nerpa with a large amount of power.</p><br/><p>And the strength that crushed Kiriel started to surround the Nerpa\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014booooom!\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014a huge collision exploded between Hansoo and the Nerpa.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014</p><br/><p>Inside Erunheim\u2019s ship.</p><br/><p>Somebody was standing next to Erunheim with a blade.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Erunheim gritted her teeth.</p><br/><p>Although the power of the Flame had returned, she could not deal with this woman.</p><br/><p>After all, this woman was a monster that the Dragon God Armor couldn\u2019t deal with.</p><br/><p>\u2018We should\u2019ve\u2026 stopped her before she got on the ship.\u2019</p><br/><p>Then with the ship\u2019s strength, they could\u2019ve stopped her to some degree.</p><br/><p>But Kiriel did not care for her thoughts, mumbling while looking at the scene of the collision.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really seems that\u2026 Hansoo cannot trust anybody.\u201d</p><br/><p>Erunheim replied as she stared at the fight in the far distance.</p><br/><p>\u201c...Don\u2019t you feel uneasy at all? You could also end up thrown to the side.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiriel replied to the smirking Erunheim:</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 don\u2019t like a leader who can trust everyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even more so if their stakes were this high.</p><br/><p>A person suspicious of everyone was much better than a person who trusted everyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s nothing about me that would make him throw me away. Look how hardworking I am.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiriel shrugged as she said:</p><br/><p>\u201cSo hurry and fire. Quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiriel pointed towards the Nerpa radiating a powerful aura in the distance, a cold smile on her face.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

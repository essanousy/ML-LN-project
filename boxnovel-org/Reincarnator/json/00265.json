Boom! Boom!</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know what would be at the flickering light but there being light meant that there were humans.</p><br/><p>Anyways, it was better to go there.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo realized the identity of the light soon after.</p><br/><p>And then frowned.</p><br/><p>\u2018It got even more annoying. Was it a mistake to come this way?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo sighed as he saw the dozens of players shouting in the distance.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Roaaaaaaaaar!</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Azure Ice Tiger!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the... Fuck! Our Spirit Stones are overloaded!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hydros Clan.</p><br/><p>, the leader of the 3rd Spirit Land platoon of the Hydros Clan, frowned as he saw the tiger charging towards them.</p><br/><p>Usually, they would be happy to see this thing.</p><br/><p>Since the reason why their hunting team came into this Spirit Land while drinking the expensive Protection Elixirs was to kill things like this.</p><br/><p>Of course it wasn\u2019t for leveling or artifacts.</p><br/><p>Since those who were able to afford the expensive Protection Elixirs to fight in here were high ranking master players equipped with top tier artifacts.</p><br/><p>Experience and dropped artifacts were useless.</p><br/><p>They had one objective.</p><br/><p>To get a Spirit Stone.</p><br/><p>An artifact which promised the players a tremendous amount of strength that came into being after the 5th patch.</p><br/><p>Using it or selling it to to the Kingdoms or the Empire were both great options.</p><br/><p>The players, who were limited in many ways, could break through with these Spirit Stones and head further ahead.</p><br/><p>His battle strength was at level 265 despite him being at level 250 while the other 30 or so clansmen averaged at about 260.</p><br/><p>Killing a single level 270 Azure Ice Tiger was not hard.</p><br/><p>If they hadn\u2019t fought just now.</p><br/><p>Though the Spirit Stones had given them new strength, it wasn\u2019t infinite.</p><br/><p>\u2018That crazy bastard...He should just die by himself if he\u2019s going to die anyway.\u2019</p><br/><p>The gleeful atmosphere from picking up a new A rank Spirit Stone after killing off a Azure Ice Tiger started to turn grim.</p><br/><p>Most of the A rank Spirit Stones his teammates had were overloaded.</p><br/><p>And killing that thing in their current situation would cause the remaining Spirit Stones to get overloaded as well as them having to use a few more Stones of Immortality.</p><br/><p>As he thought about all this.</p><br/><p>Al-Kaeruda frowned.</p><br/><p>\u2018Which clan is this bastard from. Mannerless...You\u2019re going on the Yellow List after this.\u2019</p><br/><p>Bug players on the Blacklist.</p><br/><p>Redlist for the PKing players.</p><br/><p>And Yellowlist for the players who weren\u2019t very good to play with.</p><br/><p>Getting on the Yellowlist didn\u2019t put them in danger but rather it caused them to have a much harder time getting into hunting groups, clans and participate in other group activities.</p><br/><p>Nobody liked to play with those kind of people.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Bastard! Fuck off!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you crazy?!\u201d</p><br/><p>As if his teammates were angered as well, they stood up from their sitting positions while cursing at him.</p><br/><p>Since despite them having told him to go away, they knew well that he wouldn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>Al-Karueda clenched onto his weapon first and stood up as well.</p><br/><p>\u2018You bastard. You thought you\u2019d live if you came here? You\u2019re first.\u2019</p><br/><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><br/><p>Al-Karueda mumbled while glaring at the man running through the blizzard.</p><br/><p>Doing such a thing\u2026 It wouldn\u2019t be strange to get killed on the spot.</p><br/><p>And that man was a mess.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ll kill you both at the same time.\u2019</p><br/><p>Kiiiiing!</p><br/><p>As they had similar thoughts as Al-Karueda.</p><br/><p>Kiiiiiiing!</p><br/><p>The teammates standing behind him started to glow with various colored lights.</p><br/><p>They had started to activate the Spirit Stones before the Azure Ice Tiger got closer to them in order to deal as much damage as they could.</p><br/><p>Of course the guy running in the front was within the area of effect as well.</p><br/><p>\u2018He\u2019ll be easy to hit since he\u2019s large. Die you bastard.\u2019</p><br/><p>As Al-Karueda smiled coldly.</p><br/><p>The man who was running towards them started to shout.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck! Don\u2019t attack! Don\u2019t! It\u2019s bad! It\u2019s really really bad!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018...?\u2019</p><br/><p>The people who were about to attack stopped.</p><br/><p>What had happened?</p><br/><p>The moment they thought about what could have happened in the near vicinity.</p><br/><p>Swoosh.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuaa...Ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man who had run over with that brief moment collapsed on the ground while gasping for breath.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fuck.\u2019</p><br/><p>Al-Karueda frowned.</p><br/><p>In the brief moment they stopped to think about that could\u2019ve happened, this bastard had gotten to them already.</p><br/><p>It was now hard to attack this guy since he was amidst the clansmen now.</p><br/><p>\u2018Anyway...He\u2019s really hurt. Did something really happen?\u2019</p><br/><p>Al-Karueda stared at the mess of a man and then asked in curiosity.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis mannerless bastard...What the hell happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Spirit Land had many unexplored places and unexpected events did indeed occur from time to time.</p><br/><p>Since things had come to this, Al-Karueda asked in order to gain some intel.</p><br/><p>The man gasped for breath with a spear in hand as he pointed behind Al-Karueda and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaa...It\u2019s long to talk about! Kill that first!\u201d</p><br/><p>Roaaaaar!</p><br/><p>As the man pointed behind him.</p><br/><p>An extremely loud roar appeared not far behind Al-Karueda.</p><br/><p>Al-Karueda then remembered the tiger as he cursed out.</p><br/><p>\u201cFucking hell\u2026 It better fucking be a big deal! Kill that thing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>Booooom!</p><br/><p>The hunting team of the Hydros Clan and the Azure Ice beast collided.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh...Damn. Fucking hell man!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAaaah! Leader! You have to compensate us for this!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Hydros clansmen laid out onto the ground while gasping for breath.</p><br/><p>Two beasts at the level of an Azure Ice Tiger in a single day.</p><br/><p>Maybe three.</p><br/><p>This was the limit that they could fight without overloading the Spirit Stone and hunting safely.</p><br/><p>But they had fought twice in a row when their Spirit Stone was overloaded.</p><br/><p>Thanks to this, every Spirit Stone they had were overloaded for about an entire day.</p><br/><p>And some had to even use Stones of Immortalities.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fuck. Anyways, where\u2019s this guy from? He\u2019s pretty good.\u2019</p><br/><p>Al-Karueda looked at the man who had caused all of this in curiosity.</p><br/><p>Seeing the way he fought, he was at level 250.</p><br/><p>But his control was quite good.</p><br/><p>Good enough to not lose out to some of the top tier Master players.</p><br/><p>Though he didn\u2019t go that wild since his injuries were severe which also meant that he fought well for being so hurt which actually made Al-Karueda feel a bit better.</p><br/><p>\u2018At least he has some conscience.\u2019</p><br/><p>Al-Karueda\u2019s rage toned down a bit as he slowly walked towards the man who was checking his bodily status and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey bastard. Which clan\u2026 No. Let\u2019s hear first. What\u2019s the big deal?\u201d</p><br/><p>Being less angry was one thing and responsibilities was another.</p><br/><p>Al-Karueda asked since he had decided to receive the compensation from this time around from this guy\u2019s clan but then changed his question.</p><br/><p>The thing this man had shouted about before bothered him.</p><br/><p>In a situation where his clansmen statuses were like this, if this event could harm them then he would need to evacuate this place and fall back.</p><br/><p>The man who was healing himself spoke out.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know where this place is right?\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the clansmen replied with annoyance.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe know. Area 11. Azure Tundra, Northern Area.\u201d</p><br/><p>Northern area of the Azure Tundra.</p><br/><p>One of the deepest areas of the Spirit Land.</p><br/><p>Nobody had gotten further north from this place.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t like it was locked but rather that it was too dangerous.</p><br/><p>The man nodded as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? What the hell do you mea\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Whoooosh!</p><br/><p>A red cloud exploded out from around Hansoo.</p><br/><p>The adventurers would\u2019ve freaked out from the killing intent within this cloud.</p><br/><p>But these guys were players, they could not feel such a thing.</p><br/><p>While they were confused.</p><br/><p>Kiiiririririk!</p><br/><p>Crrunnnch!</p><br/><p>\u201cUhh? Huhh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUaaak! What the hell is this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even before they could freak out, the red clouds that had attached to their body started to devour them.</p><br/><p>Like a swarm of locusts eating at rice plants in the swamps.</p><br/><p>The players tried to retaliate but they were tired to death already and had expanded their Spirit Stones already.</p><br/><p>They could not deal with Hansoo who had healed himself while they were fighting.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastard! You\u2019re going to go on the Redlist\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>With those last words from Al-Karueda.</p><br/><p>Whoooooosh.</p><br/><p>Only Hansoo remained behind in the vast land where the blizzard was storming around.</p><br/><p>Kiiiiiiiiing!</p><br/><p>\u201cUaaaaak! You bas\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Crunch!</p><br/><p>Hansoo dealt with the ones reviving with the Stone of Immortality and was in glee while picking up the artifacts on the ground.</p><br/><p>An A grade Venom type Spirit Stone that they had dropped.</p><br/><p>And an A grade Ice type Spirit Stone the Azure Ice Tiger had dropped.</p><br/><p>Hansoo picked up these two things, sensed that the other tigers weren\u2019t headed this way and relaxed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well I\u2019m alive for now.\u2019</p><br/><p>As his safety had been secured, he naturally started to worry about the rest.</p><br/><p>What would be going on in the War Fortress?</p><br/><p>Were the Ains doing well?</p><br/><p>How would Mudusella have ended things?</p><br/><p>And a few other things.</p><br/><p>\u2018..They\u2019ll be doing well.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo decided to just let things go as they would.</p><br/><p>The Ains and the ones he had brought would do things well.</p><br/><p>No, they had to do well.</p><br/><p>And he couldn\u2019t go back anyway.</p><br/><p>If this place was indeed Area 11 the clansman had spoken about.</p><br/><p>This place was extremely far away from the War Zone, the most northern land of the Spirit Land.</p><br/><p>It\u2019d take forever to return.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Mudusella. Why did you really bring me here?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo pondered for a moment and then stood up.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know why she had brought him here but he knew where she was telling him to go.</p><br/><p>\u2018If she sent me here then...There\u2019ll be answers over there.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo got up and then started to head towards the north.</p><br/><p>The answers would be over there.</p><br/><p>\u2018And\u2026 I guess I should get a spirit since I\u2019m here. Not some fakes like these...But a real one.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo mumbled as he looked at the Spirit Stone in his hand.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

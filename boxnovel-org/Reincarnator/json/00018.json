These fifteen people are the weakest\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>The fifteen who had been chosen made a blank expression for a moment and then shouted in despair.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThough I have more runes then him?\u201d</p><br/><p>But Hansoo shook his head.</p><br/><p>He could guess who would win and who would lose at a glance.</p><br/><p>It would differ slightly depending on the condition but even if you take all of that into consideration, the people who would go in were rather obvious.</p><br/><p>And at Hansoo\u2019s pointings, joy and sorrow were shown.</p><br/><p>The fifteen who were chosen showed rage and felt wronged.</p><br/><p>And the fifteen who weren\u2019t chosen let out a sigh of relief because they could save runes.</p><br/><p>And in Hansoo\u2019s words the man shouted in despair.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bitch! You\u2019re the same! How dare you throw us off because we\u2019re weak! And those bastards over there throw lives away because a of a few runes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo stopped his steps.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm. It seems you are mistaken about something\u201d</p><br/><p>Then Hansoo spoke as he scratched his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get thrown off because you\u2019re weak. If you are weak you simply can\u2019t follow up with others. Nothing to do with being thrown off\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat were you doing whilst everybody was running? It doesn\u2019t matter whether you rested or did something else but you need to take all responsibility for it in this place\u201d</p><br/><p>Those words were driven into everyone\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>And that they all realized at the same time.</p><br/><p>That they had really entered a screwed up world.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t like the modern society where you had a chance of bouncing back if you fail and fall behind others.</p><br/><p>No, it was actually much more cruel.</p><br/><p>Since that fairy thing came out from time to time and tries to cut off the tail which was falling behind.</p><br/><p>If you do not want to be cut off, you need to run fanatically.</p><br/><p>They had to realize this within the 1st tutorial area.</p><br/><p>That this was a world where you needed to be greedy in order to survive.</p><br/><p>If you are greedy you will probably receive the curses of others but you will gain the rights to survive during a decisive moment.</p><br/><p>Like this situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamnit! Damnit!\u201d</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s voice of despair could be heard behind the disappearing back of Hansoo.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo spoke quietly.</p><br/><p>\u201cListen till the end. I\u2019m not telling you to go in there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then was there a different solution?</p><br/><p>The man looked at Hansoo with a expression full of hope.</p><br/><p>Then Hansoo nodded his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe fifteen will borrow the runes from others. Two of strength and stamina each. And then give it to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd hunt during the remaining 72 hours in order to pay the runes back to them\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone nodded after pondering for a moment</p><br/><p>There was nothing to lose.</p><br/><p>Even the people who were left out were feeling a bit off because of the thoughts of throwing in fifteen people alive into that altar but if this new method were to be followed they had nothing to lose so everything was solved.</p><br/><p>And of course in the fifteen people\u2019s situation, hunting monsters to pay back the runes is better then going into the monster\u2019s mouth as food.</p><br/><p>Since it wasn\u2019t that hard to collect 2 strength and 2 stamina runes in three days.</p><br/><p>But then one person mumbled as if he felt he was mistreated.</p><br/><p>Because then only these fifteen had to pay the runes.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Isn\u2019t that unfair then? 1 per person is fair\u201d</p><br/><p>But then Hansoo shrugged his shoulders</p><br/><p>\u201cBut the one who will be going in is you, you know? Why would the remaining 45 pay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The man who had spoken before shut his mouth at these words but somebody else spoke up as if he felt the greed rising up.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut then why are we paying them if you are the one getting the runes? Isn\u2019t the one who is taking the 60 runes you in the end?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a hobby in free public service. I can\u2019t force you to do it. This simply a suggestion I\u2019m giving to the fifteen people. What I suggested isn\u2019t the correct solution nor is it the perfect solution. I\u2019m just giving a suggestion on what I think is the best solution. If you don\u2019t think you will be within the 15 people or feel pressured by this choice, I will just come back in 3 days.\u201d</p><br/><p>He could probably gather up 30 runes if he hunted.</p><br/><p>The man quieted down at those words.</p><br/><p>Because if Hansoo did leave, he would be thrown inside that altar.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou need to at least be able to pay for the price of your life\u201d</p><br/><p>Another person asked as soon as Hansoo finished talking.</p><br/><p>It was the woman who was arguing with the man from before.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait! What happens if the ones we lend the runes to can\u2019t muster up the courage to hunt and cannot pay back? Then we\u2019re losing out on runes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fifteen people were weak because they had no courage to hunt.</p><br/><p>They might not be able to return the rune within the next 3 days.</p><br/><p>Hansoo replied very simply.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you worrying about? Just chase them down during the night and take it from them. If it still isn\u2019t enough after that then come to me. I will compensate you\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He needed to set up rules but rules that would even apply to the ones who can\u2019t keep promises or take responsibility were not needed.</p><br/><p>Since he hadn\u2019t come to preach to them about social welfare.</p><br/><p>Everyone made a scared expression at those words.</p><br/><p>Because they realized that they couldn\u2019t laze around from now on.</p><br/><p>But at the same time everybody made a content face.</p><br/><p>Because it was solved without anybody dying in the end.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one hour left. Let\u2019s start now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone started to gather up the runes at those words.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>[Kang Hansoo]</p><br/><p>Strength: 84.3</p><br/><p>Stamina: 85.8</p><br/><p>Agility: 42.1</p><br/><p>Perception: 42.2</p><br/><p>Mana: 22</p><br/><p>Magic resistance: 13</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded whilst looking at his Strength and Stamina that had risen by exactly 30.</p><br/><p>\u2018The balance has been destroyed but there\u2019s nothing I can do about that\u2019</p><br/><p>To be honest, even though you lose out a bit it is better to balance out your stats by trading runes around.</p><br/><p>But this was an exception.</p><br/><p>Hansoo knew instinctively by simply looking at the Carnivorous Monster.</p><br/><p>With his current runes, his attacks wouldn\u2019t work properly.</p><br/><p>He needed to get his strength over 100.</p><br/><p>And he needed the stamina to follow up the increased strength.</p><br/><p>Agility and perception was lacking but he would compensate for that with his experiences and battle skills.</p><br/><p>\u2018It seems I\u2019ll use a ton of these cloud snacks\u2019</p><br/><p>In order to go over 100, he will probably need to constantly use the cloud snack that increased his stats by 20%.</p><br/><p>\u2018But it\u2019s good that it\u2019s an environment where I can fight alone.\u2019</p><br/><p>Usually, even Hansoo preferred hunting in groups.</p><br/><p>Since in reality the hunting speed was slightly faster when he hunted with Taesoon before.</p><br/><p>But the situation was different.</p><br/><p>If there are others it becomes disadvantageous.</p><br/><p>No matter how many there were, their attacks wouldn\u2019t work against the monster and the monster will regenerate its health after devouring the people.</p><br/><p>If that guy was released it would\u2019ve been quite a headache.</p><br/><p>When Hansoo was about to start heading towards the Altar in the distance, somebody approached him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHansoo, Mihee. It\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSangjin\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Mihee made a happy expression, stopped, then stole a glance at Hansoo.</p><br/><p>Hansoo was looking at Sangjin with a impenitent expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince Taesoon isn\u2019t here anymore, let\u2019s be together. You too Mihee.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo shook his head at those words.</p><br/><p>But Sangjin didn\u2019t give up and tried to approach him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it better being with us? With friends?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo stared at Sangjin expressionlessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce we part, we need to go separate ways\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo had no thoughts of cutting off their relationship because they didn\u2019t want to follow him when he went into a dangerous place.</p><br/><p>Since being weak wasn\u2019t a sin and he had no confidence in keeping them safe.</p><br/><p>But you can\u2019t become friends with somebody who is always looking for chances as they follow you and then leave because things get dangerous.</p><br/><p>This was a problem before strength came into play.</p><br/><p>No, being stronger was actually more of a problem.</p><br/><p>Since he can\u2019t show his back to them with trust.</p><br/><p>There won\u2019t be a reason to see each other again.</p><br/><p>\u2018He\u2019s too much\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Sangjin lost his determination from Hansoo\u2019s attitude and made a dejected expression.</p><br/><p>Whilst that was going on, Mihee spoke to Hansoo after pondering for a moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay here then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a bad choice,\u201d</p><br/><p>Mihee had a bitter expression from Hansoo\u2019s words which he didn\u2019t ponder over.</p><br/><p>Since it felt mean that he didn\u2019t realize her crush on him and had accepted her choice.</p><br/><p>\u2018I want to go with him but\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>She realized as she hunted with Hansoo over a few days.</p><br/><p>The gap was growing larger as they went on.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo was dashing off at a crazy pace. The hunting grounds were limited and she was able to follow up because she could hunt in these places but she had no confidence in fighting against that monster no matter what.</p><br/><p>And in the area they move to after killing that beast, it would be even harder to catch up to him.</p><br/><p>So she had to choose around now.</p><br/><p>Companions around her level.</p><br/><p>If she followed Hansoo like this, and then becomes thrown off after the tutorial area then she will be alone.</p><br/><p>If that happens then it would be better to move as a six by becoming a comrade of five people.</p><br/><p>\u2018And it\u2019s better to split up now\u2019</p><br/><p>She understood Hansoo\u2019s standards whilst fighting roughly.</p><br/><p>If she ran away while fighting because things got dangerous then their relationship will be cut off. Like the five in front of her eyes.</p><br/><p>But if they split up now, Hansoo wouldn\u2019t ruthlessly cut her off when he sees her later.</p><br/><p>Hansoo just didn\u2019t trust in opportunists, it wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t didn\u2019t like somebody who knew when to stay out and when to stick around.</p><br/><p>\u2018Though it\u2019s a little bit regrettable\u2019</p><br/><p>She thought about it before for a short moment.</p><br/><p>If she became a couple with this man then wouldn\u2019t she be able to be with him for a very long time.</p><br/><p>Since Hansoo wasn\u2019t the type of person who would throw off his lover.</p><br/><p>But she knew after observing for a moment.</p><br/><p>\u2018There is no space in Hansoo\u2019s head for a lover to fit in\u2019</p><br/><p>So cleanly split up now and then aim for the next chance.</p><br/><p>\u2018Just wait. I haven\u2019t given up yet.\u2019</p><br/><p>Mihee put down her decisions and walked towards Sangjin.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo laughed as he watched that.</p><br/><p>The five others might be a bit different but he could meet Mihee in the future whilst laughing.</p><br/><p>Sangjin didn\u2019t know how to act after watching this scene from happiness.</p><br/><p>He was happy to the point where the depression from being rejected by Hansoo almost disappeared.</p><br/><p>Mihee didn\u2019t choose Hansoo but his side instead.</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t this mean that his side was more trustworthy.</p><br/><p>Mihee was extremely fast to catch onto things.</p><br/><p>She had judged that he had better potential than Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yeah. I\u2019m still improving. I just never had the chances to do so\u2019</p><br/><p>Sangjin, who had laughed out loud, thanked Taesoon who was probably in the netherworld by now.</p><br/><p>\u2018Park Taesoon. I must really thank you\u2019</p><br/><p>A girl who he wouldn\u2019t even be able to talk to usually had chosen him.</p><br/><p>And in his group there were three girls even if you disregard Gangtae\u2019s girlfriend Jisun.</p><br/><p>He felt like he would fly threw the skies from the feeling as if he had set up a Harem.</p><br/><p>This was all due to Taesoon.</p><br/><p>The only reason why he was able to come this far was he filled the empty space after Taesoon had died.</p><br/><p>Sunmi, who was standing behind Sangjin, watched him pathetically.</p><br/><p>\u2018Seriously. I have to trust this retard and follow him around.\u2019</p><br/><p>Would Mihee have not been able to distinguish between and sports car and a trash car and came here.</p><br/><p>She had only come here because she thought she didn\u2019t have the ability to drive around the sports car.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well that\u2019s that.\u2019</p><br/><p>Sunmi decided to let go of past issues.</p><br/><p>Since Sangjin and Mihee were the strongest of the six, no, strongest of the mob.</p><br/><p>If you don\u2019t account for Hansoo then these guys are the two tops.</p><br/><p>And the four of them were also part of the strongest if you don\u2019t count in Hansoo.</p><br/><p>If they travel together then they wouldn\u2019t have any difficult times for a while.</p><br/><p>And even more so since Mihee probably learned a lot of things from Hansoo.</p><br/><p>Whilst Sunmi was making such thoughts, Sangjin was watching Hansoo and not Mihee.</p><br/><p>\u2018Am I not good enough yet\u2019</p><br/><p>Sangjin made a regrettable expression as he saw Hansoo\u2019s back as he walked towards the altar.</p><br/><p>He was trying so hard to become a friend but Hansoo didn\u2019t even care about him.</p><br/><p>Shouldn\u2019t he at least try to do something together.</p><br/><p>Unlike Mihee, he was simply just hitting a wall.</p><br/><p>\u2018Something\u2026 I have to show him something more\u2019</p><br/><p>It was because he was still weak.</p><br/><p>Since he wasn\u2019t a beauty like Mihee so he needed to show something more to Hansoo. A deciding factor.</p><br/><p>But then at that moment somebody called Sangjin.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey friend. Could we talk for a moment?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026Who could it be.\u2019</p><br/><p>When Sangjin went over there, a few people were standing there.</p><br/><p>\u2018These people are\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>These guys were the ones who were speaking aloud during the debate before.</p><br/><p>The ones who represented the strong, and the real top rankers if you don\u2019t count for him and his friends.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m called Suyeol. You\u2019re the leader of those friends over there right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe leader?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangjin\u2019s face blushed for a moment from the words of the thirty-something man, he then answered shyly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all friends so ehh. But for now they\u2019re listening to me well\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. Nice\u201d</p><br/><p>As Suyeol raised his thumb at him, Sangjin giggled from being happy.</p><br/><p>Suyeol chuckled at Sangjin acting like that and then continued his words.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen are you friends with that guy called Hansoo over there too?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangjin pondered for a moment and then nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018We\u2019re friends. Yeah friends.\u2019</p><br/><p>Suyeol, who had confirmed up to that point, made a satisfied expression as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah? Then I have something a proposal for you, shall we talk for a bit?\u201d</p><br/><p>He said whilst stealing a glance at Hansoo who was walking towards the altar.</p><br/><p>Sangjin pondered for a moment but then followed him shortly after nodding his head.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

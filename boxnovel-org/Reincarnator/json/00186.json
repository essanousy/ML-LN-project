My king. Please avenge me.\u2019</p><br/><p>It wouldn\u2019t matter.</p><br/><p>No one could win over quantity.</p><br/><p>There was a limit to how much a single person can accomplish.</p><br/><p>Even killing himself who had fallen into a trap was this hard for him.</p><br/><p>He would not be able to contend against a king who ruled over a world and his huge army.</p><br/><p>Akitrus suppressed his nervousness and then looked at Hansoo again.</p><br/><p>The thing that came into his eyes after the armor was the ring on his hand.</p><br/><p>The object which had killed him.</p><br/><p>Not only did it smash apart his mana barrier, it pushed its mysterious aura inside him and was still shining.</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>Akitrus remembered that he had seen that ring before.</p><br/><p>So distinct that he could remember even right as he was about to die.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026Where did I see it?\u2019</p><br/><p>As the spear reached right up to his nose, Akitrus\u2019s brain went through his entire memory at lightning fast speed.</p><br/><p>As the spear cut through his fur as was proceeding to enter his flesh.</p><br/><p>Akitrus finally rummaged through his memories and remembered where he had seen it before.</p><br/><p>The three Higher races.</p><br/><p>And the three kings who ruled over those races.</p><br/><p>There was a time when the three kings, who weren\u2019t really on friendly terms with each other, had gathered together.</p><br/><p>To meet a single human being.</p><br/><p>It was an unprecedented event.</p><br/><p>Almost a hundred Satellite Fortresses were on guard against each other and had gathered in the center of the Green Road and hundreds of warriors also gathered at that location in order to guard their king.</p><br/><p>Of course Akitrus, the judge and the strongest warrior of his entire race, had been there too.</p><br/><p>He had seen it then.</p><br/><p>The arrogant human who had called the three kings.</p><br/><p>And the ring that was on her hand.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes. That\u2019s it! I remember it!\u2019</p><br/><p>He remembered clearly.</p><br/><p>Since the king of the Rebeloongs asked the human because he wanted that ring.</p><br/><p>A king granting somebody a wish.</p><br/><p>There was no wish that a king who ruled a third of this entire world could not grant.</p><br/><p>A tremendous opportunity.</p><br/><p>Even Akitrus and Dakidus\u2019s mouths had gaped open.</p><br/><p>They knew the king of the Rebeloongs loved jewelry and precious objects so much but for him to grant a wish for one.</p><br/><p>But the human, Clementine, kicked away that opportunity in an instant.</p><br/><p>A one of a kind of a ring.</p><br/><p>As he saw this.</p><br/><p>Akitrus grinded his teeth.</p><br/><p>A strange noise came out from the half blown away mouth of Akitrus.</p><br/><p>\u2018I knew this would happen. These fucking bugs.\u2019</p><br/><p>The story changes.</p><br/><p>If the ones who have the Destruction Jade obtain these strange liquid metals?</p><br/><p>And if they start to plan things out?</p><br/><p>Akitrus\u2019s expression turned grim.</p><br/><p>He could not dodge his death anymore.</p><br/><p>The spear which had gotten through his fur and entered his flesh was slowly, very slowly entering into the space between his eyes.</p><br/><p>But he could not die like this.</p><br/><p>He needed to let this be known before he died.</p><br/><p>As the spear pierced through his skull and was heading into the brain.</p><br/><p>Akitrus didn\u2019t even shake one bit as he glared at the one piercing through his head.</p><br/><p>He focused on the face and the ring.</p><br/><p>And everything he saw was recorded and sent by the helmet on his head.</p><br/><p>\u2018O king. These bugs have betrayed us. Look at this guy. Look at the ring in his hands.\u2019</p><br/><p>This should be enough.</p><br/><p>The rest would be solved by his comrades who receive the information.</p><br/><p>And as he thought that his job was done, his mouth slightly curled up to a smile.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yeah. I didn\u2019t like them in the first place. For them to stand on equal grounds with us.\u2019</p><br/><p>They would be able to kill Metiron and the others hiding in the Green Road.</p><br/><p>No, it wouldn\u2019t just end there.</p><br/><p>They will kill every single human being in the village, Bird Cade and the Green Road as well.</p><br/><p>Since the humans were just being raised from Clementine\u2019s demands anyway.</p><br/><p>\u2018They\u2019ll be able to kill. Since they\u2019re all gathered in one place.\u2019</p><br/><p>As Akitrus was about to laugh coldly.</p><br/><p>Whooosh</p><br/><p>The spearhead penetrated through his brain.</p><br/><p>And Akitrus\u2019s consciousness disappeared along with it.</p><br/><p>\u201cPhew\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Rumble</p><br/><p>The moment Akitrus died.</p><br/><p>The Maze rumbled as it spread out.</p><br/><p>At the same time the liquid metal that was surrounding Hansoo\u2019s body got sucked into the maze walls.</p><br/><p>Hansoo didn\u2019t release them.</p><br/><p>Something more powerful than the dark cloud had forcibly taken it.</p><br/><p>The metal the Thousand Soldiers Armor had eaten had remained but the metal armor surrounding Hansoo\u2019s body got spread out as the metal returned to the maze walls.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo frowned as he picked up the Akion.</p><br/><p>This strange effect meant that the complete owner of the of the maze had appeared.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026Karhal and Ekidu failed huh\u2019</p><br/><p>While he had been blocking Akitrus here, Karhal and Ekidu had run through the wall Hansoo had broken and headed towards the one with the crown.</p><br/><p>Since it would be too dangerous to deal with Akitrus and the one who controlled the maze from the same location.</p><br/><p>\u2018They should\u2019ve been able to succeed according to my calculations.\u2019</p><br/><p>The metal spears were fast and strong but Karhal and Ekidu\u2019s bodies were more than enough to dodge them.</p><br/><p>And for the person to not attack him after completely taking over the maze.</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>Rumble</p><br/><p>A wall of the maze crumbled as a path leading somewhere appeared.</p><br/><p>As if it was welcoming Hansoo who had slain Akitrus.</p><br/><p>As if it was welcoming a general coming back from the war, the liquid metals protruded out from the walls in a shape of trumpets as they rang out.</p><br/><p>Pah-pa-rah!</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026He\u2019s not that talented in music it seems.\u2019</p><br/><p>Anyways, it didn\u2019t seem like there was much enmity.</p><br/><p>Hansoo listened to the music which was off tone and off beat as he ran through the tunnel and headed into the center of the maze.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>After a long run a huge area could be seen.</p><br/><p>There were only two people within the huge cave filled with thousands of skeletons.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026You came?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Karhal and Ekidu were staring at the center of the throne with perplex expressions.</p><br/><p>And a single corpse was laying on the throne powerlessly.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026He was called Junghwan I believe.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo frowned as he looked at Junghwan with his right hand missing.</p><br/><p>And the crown on his head had disappeared as well.</p><br/><p>Ekidu looked between Hansoo and the corpse as she spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe moment we arrived he collapsed. And the crown\u2026The liquid metal came out and took it up.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was something shining red at the top of the cave.</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>Gurgle gurgle.</p><br/><p>Something came out from the ground.</p><br/><p>Some liquid metal.</p><br/><p>Flinch.</p><br/><p>Ekidu and Karhal guarded against it nervously.</p><br/><p>Since they remembered how they had suffered from the liquid metals from before.</p><br/><p>They had thought the attacks had stopped as Junghwan died but for them to return.</p><br/><p>But the liquid metals did not turn into the sharp spears.</p><br/><p>Actually they just gurgled around like oil and then turned into a familiar look.</p><br/><p>Gurgle Gurgle.</p><br/><p>Junghwan, who still had his hand missing, smiled as he appeared before the three.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026This bastard. What\u2019s he thinking?\u2019</p><br/><p>Karhal frowned as he looked at Junghwan.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

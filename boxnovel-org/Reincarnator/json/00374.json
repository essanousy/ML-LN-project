(4)</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo looked at the castle-like structure that seemed to be made up of layers of machines and continued to run towards it.</p><br/><p>The machine castle seemed to let out energy that was larger than that of the two energies bursting at the sides.</p><br/><p>The machine castle\u2014clearly belonging to Melchizedek\u2014didn\u2019t seem to be welcoming Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u2018It doesn\u2019t look prepared for a guest.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014boom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo looked at the pillar of light that rose into the skies in the distance.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014the spikes embedded around Hansoo\u2019s now upgraded body started to suck out mana at a rapid pace.</p><br/><p>\u2014kakakakak!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Similar to how icicles form, the armor turned into a crystalline structure as it devoured more mana and quickly covered his body.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo\u2019s Demonic Dragon Reinforcement covered the blue armor with another layer of protection.</p><br/><p>\u2014booooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Artillery shells were being fired from a distance and started smashing at Hansoo\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Bright blue strikes that smashed the ground all around them.</p><br/><p>The force of the strikes was so intense that it even dug apart the Nelkipa skin, which had withstood the Photon Strikes.</p><br/><p>It was a strength that was incomparable to anything before.</p><br/><p>\u2014boom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014booooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>His Demonic Dragon Reinforcement deflected the strikes away, but the attacks succeeded in stopping him from charging forward.</p><br/><p>Hansoo frowned.</p><br/><p>Even Melchizedek could not create this powerful of an attack with his technology.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo soon realized the answer.</p><br/><p>\u2018Crystal.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The attacks were mixed with bright blue energy.</p><br/><p>Hansoo sighed and tightly clenched his hammer\u2014 Melchizedek\u2019s forces were using the energy from the crystal.</p><br/><p>At this rate, it would be hard to advance even if his body could withstand it.</p><br/><p>The ground beneath his feet was breaking apart just by defending against these attacks.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m not really into being whacked around.\u2019</p><br/><p>Withstanding firepower of this scale would cause his Pandemic Blade to lose a large amount of strength as well.</p><br/><p>The thing he needed now was a single, powerful strike.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014chichichichichik\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014five dragons popped out from Hansoo\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Five dragons that were much thicker and deeper in color than in the past.</p><br/><p>Each one was so overbearing that they seemed like they would soar into the skies at any moment.</p><br/><p>The dragons were made from a 3-Star level of mana and power, and they quickly flew into the hammer, condensing into a single point.</p><br/><p>Hansoo gathered this strength and slammed down onto the ground.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014booooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Like an Earth Dragon swimming through the ground\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014dozens of black lightning bolts flew through the ground in all directions, each bolt strengthened by Hansoo\u2019s Nine Dragons Strike.</p><br/><p>Each bolt of lightning flew through the Nelkipa\u2019s skin like a dragon and soon smashed into the machine castle in the distance.</p><br/><p>A bright blue shield powered by energy from the crystal started to defend the army, but it was only for a moment.</p><br/><p>\u2014kaduk!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The dozens of black lightning bolts smashed through the shield like a thin layer of ice and attacked the mechanical soldiers.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014booooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014a tremendous shockwave shook the area.</p><br/><p>The mechanical soldiers who were directly hit by that strike melted down from the sheer amount of energy, like ice cream under a hot sun.</p><br/><p>And it didn\u2019t stop there.</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The electromagnetic field created from the explosions started to spread through the area as well.</p><br/><p>Of course, Melchizedek\u2019s forces had some level of resistance towards it, but there was a limit.</p><br/><p>\u2014chiiijijik\u2014 </p><br/><p>The soldiers, whose circuits had all burned up by the electromagnetic storm, made strange noises and fell to the ground.</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014 </p><br/><p>With that one strike, the rain of attacks had diminished to a degree.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo knew\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014that this wasn\u2019t the end.</p><br/><p>\u2014kigigigik\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014kiririk\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo watched hundreds of soldiers rebuild their bodies, preparing to attack him again and continued to dash towards the castle again.</p><br/><p>\u2014booooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014boom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The attacks still struck him, but at a much-diminished aura and strength.</p><br/><p>\u2014whoooosh!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Thanks to this, Hansoo had been able to move towards the castle at a much faster pace.</p><br/><p>\u2018This isn\u2019t really my style, but\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014boooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014boom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo withstood the countless strikes like a tank and started thinking.</p><br/><p>Although he liked single, powerful strikes, this really wasn\u2019t his hobby.</p><br/><p>He avoided battles as much as possible and focused on his objective.</p><br/><p>He saved his strength and only focused on taking the neck of his objective.</p><br/><p>Up until now, he\u2019d fought in the frontlines because the situation had demanded it, but he personally preferred being an assassin over a warrior.</p><br/><p>Even if it took a bit longer, it was a much more efficient and safe job.</p><br/><p>But of course, the current situation didn\u2019t allow it.</p><br/><p>He had to deal with this as fast as possible.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just Melchizedek, either.</p><br/><p>Even if he dealt with this place, but if they lost at the other two places, it was still a failure in the end.</p><br/><p>He had to deal with this place as fast as possible and support the other two.</p><br/><p>Of course, it would be even better if Kiriel and Enbi Arin could deal with their opponents and then came to help him.</p><br/><p>But it didn\u2019t seem like it would be that easy.</p><br/><p>Their opponents really didn\u2019t seem easy.</p><br/><p>\u2018The Valentine siblings\u2026 I\u2019ll leave it to you two, Kiriel and Enbi Arin.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014boom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo thought about these four names as he continued to charge through the attacks, the energy behind each strike causing his body temperature to steadily rise up.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u201cWoah\u2026 he\u2019s really something, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ares whistled as he felt the vibrations in the air and the shockwaves in the ground.</p><br/><p>Even if he was far away, the shockwaves were something to behold.</p><br/><p>Melchizedek\u2019s personal castle that even they didn\u2019t dare to enter.</p><br/><p>Huge shockwaves and the sounds of loud explosions were continuously resonating from Melchizedek\u2019s castle.</p><br/><p>\u2018...So Kang Hansoo is the one that went there? He\u2019s more stupid than I thought.\u2019</p><br/><p>Ares Valentine was really shocked as he suppressed the sweat rolling down from the side of his neck.</p><br/><p>\u2018Need to keep calm.\u2019</p><br/><p>In reality, he was kind of glad.</p><br/><p>Although he didn\u2019t think he would lose, but if someone that stupid came to him then things would become very annoying.</p><br/><p>People like that thought along the lines of \u2018It\u2019s all fine as long as I can smash apart my opponent\u2019s body before mine gets smashed apart.\u2019.</p><br/><p>From the opponent\u2019s point of view, it would be a battle without profit even if they won, and they were likely to receive a large amount of damage.</p><br/><p>The most annoying kind of person to fight.</p><br/><p>If he had come here, it would have truly been a dirty battle.</p><br/><p>Ares Valentine thought that his luck was quite good.</p><br/><p>\u2018A beauty has arrived instead.\u2019</p><br/><p>Ares Valentine chuckled as he looked at Enbi Arin, who stared at him with cold eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m really curious, but did you really come here to win?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014crackle\u2014 </p><br/><p>Ares Valentine moved his hand and cracked it as he asked.</p><br/><p>The armor she had on seemed to be quite useful.</p><br/><p>Even more so if one took into the fact that it was hard to find armor that Transcendents could use.</p><br/><p>But that was it.</p><br/><p>He could estimate her level.</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin was a tiny chick that had just risen to the 3-Star level.</p><br/><p>It was unpleasant to call himself this, but he was an old man in terms of 3-Star Transcendents.</p><br/><p>\u2018Not all 3-Stars are the same.\u2019</p><br/><p>He was excited.</p><br/><p>Even though battles made him tense.</p><br/><p>But there was nothing more fun than a battle where one knew they\u2019d win.</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin clenched her fists as she muttered:</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I came to win, you damned bastard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ares Valentine looked at Enbi Arin and thought she was sexy.</p><br/><p>He really liked Enbi Arin.</p><br/><p>A woman who was this strong.</p><br/><p>As well as her sexy appearance and fit physique.</p><br/><p>And her fiery temper.</p><br/><p>His most ideal type.</p><br/><p>It was why he\u2019d tried so hard to invite Enbi Arin to their side.</p><br/><p>Even while listening to the storm of curses from Elis.</p><br/><p>He was a bit upset that Elis\u2019s attitude towards him had grown colder, but he didn\u2019t regret his decision.</p><br/><p>If there was no longer any love in this damned world, then how tragic would that be?</p><br/><p>\u2018If I had gone up to the 3-Star level first, then\u2026 I might\u2019ve been able to have you.\u2019</p><br/><p>So he had tried so hard.</p><br/><p>To become strong enough to suppress Enbi Arin.</p><br/><p>If he surprised her with his power than she would have no choice but to join them first.</p><br/><p>While keeping Enbi Arin as his goal, he had risen up to a 3-Star, and the first thing he'd done afterward was to seek her out.</p><br/><p>But he had been a step too late\u2014Melchizedek had taken her.</p><br/><p>He had lamented this.</p><br/><p>The Enbi Arin under Melchizedek\u2019s control was not the Enbi Arin he liked.</p><br/><p>So he had given up on her, but nobody would know of his feelings.</p><br/><p>He had run so hard after one goal, but that goal had disappeared.</p><br/><p>He\u2019d experienced the sensation of having his heart ripped apart.</p><br/><p>But that goal had appeared before him again.</p><br/><p>And still with her own mind intact.</p><br/><p>\u2018Today\u2026 is really my lucky day.\u2019</p><br/><p>Ares Valentine\u2019s heart started beating faster.</p><br/><p>His goal had appeared again before he went up.</p><br/><p>How great was this?</p><br/><p>Although it wasn\u2019t the best situation that she was now a 3-Star, but that didn\u2019t matter.</p><br/><p>Since he would win.</p><br/><p>\u2018Enbi Arin. Let\u2019s go together.\u2019</p><br/><p>Ares Valentine looked at Enbi Arin with a trembling heart.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026Ares Valentine. That crazy bastard. He\u2019s not spouting some nonsense about his love and ignoring his duties, right?\u2019</p><br/><p>Elis Valentine, who had been dealing with Kiriel, thought of her younger brother and then frowned.</p><br/><p>Hearing that her younger brother\u2019s crush had gone to him kept on bugging her.</p><br/><p>But Elis Valentine decided to ignore it.</p><br/><p>\u2018I just need to deal with this quickly and go over.\u2019</p><br/><p>No matter how brash he was, he wouldn\u2019t ignore her own words.</p><br/><p>Elis decided to handle this quickly and smiled at Kiriel.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have something to do, so let\u2019s finish this quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you didn\u2019t say that\u2026 I was planning on doing the same thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn. She\u2019s quite good, though.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014spit\u2014</p><br/><p>The surroundings had long been destroyed by their confrontations.</p><br/><p>And within a giant hole in the ground created from one of their collisions.</p><br/><p>Kiriel spat out some blood as she touched the cheek that Elis had struck and frowned.</p><br/><p>She was really strong.</p><br/><p>\u2018I wonder if I can really stop her\u2026 Damn.\u2019</p><br/><p>Kiriel frowned as she looked at the raging crystal behind Elis.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Originally, the only one qualified for transcendence is you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even when the walls existed.</p><br/><p>There were existences who could break through the ceiling and grow.</p><br/><p>Transcendents.</p><br/><p>People who had the rights to break through the limits set by the world and go above and beyond.</p><br/><p>This right was completely up to one\u2019s potential.</p><br/><p>People who weren\u2019t born with this couldn\u2019t even dream of such a thing.</p><br/><p>The only transcendent who had been born in this Green Zone was Tiamet in the tens of thousands of years of its history.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying, in a situation like this where the ceiling is sealed. Only you have the right to break through it. And when that happens, those things below wouldn\u2019t be able to go up against any of your words.\u201d</p><br/><p>The best part about his trait, Seven Stars, was not really that his skills grew fast and beyond their limits.</p><br/><p>It was the fact that it gave him the right to break through the ceiling that stopped everyone else.</p><br/><p>This was the true identity of the Seven Stars, one of the many forms of the Transcendent Stars.</p><br/><p>The fairy laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou could become an emperor. Leading a tremendous army. The sole sovereign of the humankind. But if you break apart the ceiling completely, that might not happen right? Competitors might appear.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because the wall existed, the one who could break through it shone the brightest.</p><br/><p>But if this wall didn\u2019t exist?</p><br/><p>Competitors would appear.</p><br/><p>There were always people who had potential, worked hard, were strong minded as well as lucky.</p><br/><p>Though there might barely be one transcendent out of billions of humans, there were countless people who could reach the wall.</p><br/><p>And as he heard this.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Ah, this is why huh.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo realized why Eres and Keldian had sent him back specifically.</p><br/><p>If Eres, Keldian or other first year adventurers came then they would\u2019ve been able to buy more time.</p><br/><p>But they still wouldn\u2019t be able to break down the wall between them and the Abyss which would only limit their own strength as well.</p><br/><p>And when that happened he, who would come into the tutorial, might get killed.</p><br/><p>Since unlike the other three, Hansoo was actually weak in the beginning.</p><br/><p>So they had sent him.</p><br/><p>\u2018So they knew. That a leader was needed in the end\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>After saving as many people as they could before breaking down the wall.</p><br/><p>After Hansoo put everybody under his control.</p><br/><p>So that Hansoo could lead them through the Abyss after the wall crashed.</p><br/><p>The sovereign status that was maintained with strength.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo shook his head again.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is a wrong choice as well.\u2019</p><br/><p>Strength came before anything in a victory.</p><br/><p>He could not fight with such a weak army.</p><br/><p>He needed warriors for the battle against the Abyss.</p><br/><p>People even he could barely fight against.</p><br/><p>This was that the God and the fairies wanted.</p><br/><p>Fighting and fighting.</p><br/><p>They wanted something that could amuse them to be born.</p><br/><p>\u2018...I\u2019ll play along.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo made his decision and smiled towards the fairy.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do what you guys want me to.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fairy asked again.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sure? This is a very important choice you\u2019re making. If you do this then the remaining 4 billion people or so will have their lives changed. And it\u2019s important for you as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once he broke the wall, the 4 billion or so people will fall straight into the hard and unforgiving life headfirst and would need to fight continuously.</p><br/><p>If some figured what Hansoo had done then they might hate him to the core.</p><br/><p>Why did Hasoo make them fight?</p><br/><p>And moreover it wasn\u2019t really to Hansoo\u2019s benefit.Since he had given up the chance to stand above everybody and instead had given a chance to his competitors.</p><br/><p>The people that could reach but could not break through the ceiling would soon grow crazily.</p><br/><p>And there would be people who would go against him as well.</p><br/><p>Hansoo chuckled.</p><br/><p>\u201cLiving comfortably is impossible after coming to this world.\u201d</p><br/><p>He just needed to see one thing.</p><br/><p>Could he climb over the giant wave?</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t want to nor was he confident in doing so.</p><br/><p>But he had given others a chance to gain their own strength by sacrificing their immediate comfort.</p><br/><p>A chance to gain enough strength to fly over the tsunami that would come their way in the future.</p><br/><p>Only those people, people who sacrificed their own comfortable life to get stronger, would have the right to fight against the Abyss.</p><br/><p>What he needed was not meat shield that listened to his orders.</p><br/><p>He needed allies whom he could entrust his back to.</p><br/><p>As he made his decision.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Let\u2019s begin.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo activated the soul fragments inside him.</p><br/><p>Ooooooooooon!</p><br/><p>The soul fragments trembled as they started to resonate.</p><br/><p>The three worlds Hansoo had gone through.</p><br/><p>Along with the soul fragments inside the three overseers of those worlds.</p><br/><p>The huge earthquake inside his body trembled alongside the three fragments.</p><br/><p>[Please convey everything I say...To everyone in your worlds.]</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Hansoo spoke towards the huge screen in front of him, towards the countless adventurers staring at his ship.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe words I will say from now are extremely important and things you must know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Red.</p><br/><p>Orange.</p><br/><p>Yellow.</p><br/><p>Green.</p><br/><p>Every Zone.</p><br/><p>Towards the billions of people living in these zones.</p><br/><p>His information regarding the Abyss will spread.</p><br/><p>\u2018Until the crack appears on the barrier protecting these worlds from the Abyss and things proceed onto the next level\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo spoke coldly as he felt everyone\u2019s eyes falling on him.</p><br/><p>\u201cListen well.

No matter what.\u201d</p><br/><p>A door that was shut closed.</p><br/><p>Traces of Triple Fusion Beasts.</p><br/><p>A dark tunnel.</p><br/><p>\u2018No. I cannot stay trapped here.\u2019</p><br/><p>She had never even imagined that she would die in a place like this.</p><br/><p>Her skills had been recognized and she had been promised many things.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn\u2026not hard!? They dare play with me?\u2019</p><br/><p>Merelin clenched onto an item within her hand.</p><br/><p>A small stone that the captain of the guard in her village, Epon, had given her.</p><br/><p>Epon told her.</p><br/><p>That if she held onto this then the Satellite Fortress will come and carry her away.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t believe it at first but she had to believe it after seeing Epon talk to Dakidus, the Harvester.</p><br/><p>Since it was the first time she had seen the Harvester having a long conversation with anybody.</p><br/><p>And because of this she hadn\u2019t really cared about her followers this time around.</p><br/><p>Since she was just going to move to the area where she would get onto the Satellite Fortress and get out.</p><br/><p>But what was this.</p><br/><p>The Inspector who was supposed to come was nowhere to be seen and she had been trapped within this damned nest by the beasts that she couldn\u2019t even communicate to.</p><br/><p>She had never even imagined of such a scene like this.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn! Damnit!\u2019</p><br/><p>She wanted to smash apart everything near her but instead she suppressed her anger and calmed down.</p><br/><p>Since a dumb act like that wouldn\u2019t help her in any way.</p><br/><p>She had to stay calm.</p><br/><p>\u2018Calm down. I\u2019m in a much better position than others.\u2019</p><br/><p>Merelin started to breath in and out.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t know where the forces of the captain of the guards, Epon, or the Arukons were but if she found strong guys such as them then she would be able to stay alive.</p><br/><p>The other side was too serious for all of this to be a joke.</p><br/><p>There should be a mistake somewhere she just needed to get out of here and fix it.</p><br/><p>And thoughts such as this made her feel at ease.</p><br/><p>Since she didn\u2019t need to go through the entire Green Road where beasts such as the one she had seen a while ago swarmed around in.</p><br/><p>\u2018Just focus on one thing. I just need to find those guys.\u2019</p><br/><p>She started to become much more lucid as a clear goal was set.</p><br/><p>Merelin calmed down and looked at the three in front of her.</p><br/><p>She had glared them in rage but like the other woman had said, it wasn\u2019t the time to fight.</p><br/><p>And she didn\u2019t have any confidence to beat them if they fought here.</p><br/><p>\u2018Especially that guy\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Merelin gulped down her saliva as she watched the man who was inspecting the surrounding area while tapping the strange looking walls.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ve never seen something like that before. Did he learn a special skill or something?\u2019</p><br/><p>A man who had taken the beam that destroyed everything with his own body.</p><br/><p>She had seen a lot of strong people before.</p><br/><p>The leader of her village was quite strong as well and she had also seen people who were often called geniuses.</p><br/><p>But she had never seen the man in front of her before.</p><br/><p>\u2018No wait. Have I?\u2019</p><br/><p>Merelin shook her head after thinking about the past.</p><br/><p>That wasn\u2019t the important part.</p><br/><p>The important part was being with someone strong as him would be beneficial in many ways.</p><br/><p>Being together with someone strong was always beneficial.</p><br/><p>\u2018I have to survive no matter what\u2026Until I meet them.\u2019</p><br/><p>Merelin spoke out after finishing her thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going deeper?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Hansoo nodded at her question, Merelin pondered for a bit and asked again.</p><br/><p>\u201cMay I ask for what reason you are going in deeper?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re that close to tell you such things.\u201d</p><br/><p>Karhal suddenly spat out.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damned bastard.\u2019</p><br/><p>But as Hansoo didn\u2019t respond, it seems he had the same mindset as Karhal.</p><br/><p>Merelin glanced at Karhal and then spoke to Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould we follow as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Merelin?\u201d</p><br/><p>The people behind her were shocked.</p><br/><p>What was she saying.</p><br/><p>They should be trying to get out of this damned place, for them to go in deeper.</p><br/><p>Merelin shook her head as she spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we should be focused in going out for now. We should be focused on surviving. And there\u2019s no guarantee that we would be able to go out even if we separate.\u201d</p><br/><p>They had one of two choices.</p><br/><p>Do everything they can do get out.</p><br/><p>Or go along with the three other.</p><br/><p>But there was no guarantee that they, who had no idea about anything in this place or the right direction to take, would be able to find the exit.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell\u2026Yeah I guess it\u2019ll be better to go with them then.\u201d</p><br/><p>One person nodded.</p><br/><p>Those three wouldn\u2019t be heading to their deaths anyway.</p><br/><p>They should have plenty of confidence if they were going in deeper.</p><br/><p>And more than everything else, the man who was busily moving around from here to there seemed very reliable.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yeah. Surviving is better than going out.\u2019</p><br/><p>She had forgotten about the most important thing because she had been shocked by the fact that she had been trapped.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk. We don\u2019t plan on being a charity.\u201d</p><br/><p>Karhal clicked his tongue but didn\u2019t refute it.</p><br/><p>Since the small help was still help in the end.</p><br/><p>Karhal didn\u2019t show it but he had been quite nervous from the claw marks of the Triple Fusion Beast upon the walls.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn\u2026I hope we can move away from this place quickly.\u2019</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>Rumble</p><br/><p>A wall that Hansoo had touched rumbled as it opened up.</p><br/><p>At the same time a tunnel with a diameter of about 5m opened up.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t small but it was too small for a Triple Fusion Beast to go through.</p><br/><p>\u201cOhhh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone exclaimed out as they saw the tunnel.</p><br/><p>They hadn\u2019t spoken it out loud but they were all nervous from being trapped in a place like this.</p><br/><p>The triple Fusion Beast would not be able to get through a tunnel of that size no matter what.</p><br/><p>Smiles appeared on the people\u2019s faces as they could dodge away from the factor that gave them the most fear.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yeah. It\u2019s better to go with someone who at least knows a few things\u2026Than staying by ourselves and remaining clueless.\u2019</p><br/><p>Of course they didn\u2019t know what the three were thinking inside their mind but the fact that they didn\u2019t try to leave them behind with lies made them feel much more at ease.</p><br/><p>\u2018If they had ulterior motives then they would\u2019ve probably sent us out in the front.\u2019</p><br/><p>While the people were standing up after clutching onto their wounds which they had taken emergency care of.</p><br/><p>Hansoo spoke towards Ekidu and Karhal.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan we follow as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded at Merelin who was confirming it again just in case.</p><br/><p>Since these people had been trapped because of him bringing the Triple Fusion Beast here.</p><br/><p>It might\u2019ve been different if they hadn\u2019t been trapped along with him but since they were already here, there was no reason for him to stop them.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I cannot guarantee your life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course! Hahaha! Isn\u2019t that the way it\u2019s supposed to be!\u201d</p><br/><p>As if an existence which they could rely on had appeared within the darkness, a Hunter who was clutching onto his arm laughed out loudly.</p><br/><p>They wouldn\u2019t have asked to join if they weren\u2019t going to contribute their share.</p><br/><p>No, they wouldn\u2019t even have come out from the village.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeople who are like that have remained in the Farmer level for quite some time! Haha! You need to proceed with your own strength!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>While Merelin was frowning at the Hunter\u2019s words as if it was provoking her in some way, Hansoo nodded as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go. Run.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment he finished speaking.</p><br/><p>Hoooook!</p><br/><p>Hansoo started to quickly run off.</p><br/><p>And the people started to follow after seeing this.</p><br/><p>\u2018His speed is\u2026 Followable. Does he not have an Acceleration type skill?\u2019</p><br/><p>The people made expressions of relief.</p><br/><p>If that Hansoo had used an Acceleration-type skill along with his monstrous body then they wouldn\u2019t have been able to even dream about following him but his running speed was quite manageable.</p><br/><p>Hunters, Ekidu and Karhal used their skills as they followed Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u2018Good.\u2019</p><br/><p>Merelin, who had been thinking that they had escaped the imminent danger for now, suddenly remembered something.</p><br/><p>\u2018Look at me, I forgot about it.\u2019</p><br/><p>She then took out the small black stone in her hands and then carefully tied it onto a string.</p><br/><p>Then she tied it between the neck and her armor where it could be easily seen.</p><br/><p>Clang</p><br/><p>The small black rock that the captain of the guards, Epon, had given her shined on her neck.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is good.\u2019</p><br/><p>Even if she could not figure out who was supposed to help her, they would realize it after seeing this.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yeah. They have given me the offer because I was precious\u2026 They shouldn\u2019t just leave me be. I hope I can meet them as soon as possible.\u2019</p><br/><p>She thought that this strange place might be their headquarters but it didn\u2019t seem that way..</p><br/><p>It was smaller than before but the tunnel they were running through was still a bit too large.</p><br/><p>As if it wasn\u2019t a tunnel the humans went through.</p><br/><p>A complete darkness.</p><br/><p>A tunnel that spread into the distance and into the unknown.</p><br/><p>The Great Jungle where anything could pop out was a problem as well but a place like this also made one suppress their breath.</p><br/><p>Merelin, who was praying in order to get out of this nerve-wracking situation as soon as possible, smiled as she looked at Hansoo.</p><br/><p>A man who was dispersing her nervousness.</p><br/><p>\u2018Quite reliable isn\u2019t he. Please be good to us. Who knows? I might even ask that Inspector to take you along with me.\u2019</p><br/><p>That Karhal guy ahead of her was quite strong as well but there were people like him around if she searched.</p><br/><p>But that Hansoo guy was special.</p><br/><p>With his strength, even Epon\u2019s group would want to rope him in.</p><br/><p>Since they seemed to like inviting people into their group and expanding their strength.</p><br/><p>If she asked then they might even allow it.</p><br/><p>\u2018I hope they can find me quickly.\u2019</p><br/><p>If not then she needed to try a bit harder.</p><br/><p>Try harder in order to find them instead.</p><br/><p>Merelin finished her thoughts as she chased behind Hansoo.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

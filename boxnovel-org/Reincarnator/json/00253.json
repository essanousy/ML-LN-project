Wake up! Hold your positions!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMagic Brigade! Alter the grid location to R-8!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBastards! Don\u2019t run! We cannot let these guys enter the Spirit Land!\u201d</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>Knights and soldiers over level 270 were getting smashed apart and were sent flying away.</p><br/><p>With just a few thousand in numbers, the Ains were charging through the tens of thousands of well-coordinated soldiers.</p><br/><p>Enoa, the 3rd in command of the Magic Brigade, grinded his teeth as he saw this scene.</p><br/><p>\u2018Jesus...Was the time of peace that long?\u2019</p><br/><p>It has been decades since the Kingdoms have entered a time of peace after the giant wars.</p><br/><p>All the soldiers who had tasted wars had retired and the remaining soldiers, who didn\u2019t want to lose out, handed most of their jobs to the players who were immortal.</p><br/><p>In the form of quests.</p><br/><p>But the strength of the Ains was no joke.</p><br/><p>\u2018...This is not going to be easy at all.\u2019</p><br/><p>Enoa looked towards another location.</p><br/><p>And watched the hundreds of thousands of players charging towards the battle from the distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cGiddiup! A history quest after so long!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRun! Hahahaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJackpot!\u201d</p><br/><p>Those who were free from the ultimate fear of humans, death.</p><br/><p>So these guys only thought of the frightening scene in the distance as a mountain of treasure.</p><br/><p>The remaining soldiers were shouting at these players as well.</p><br/><p>Telling them that it\u2019ll be a quest with substantial rewards and that it would please the Kingdoms.</p><br/><p>But Enoa didn\u2019t expect that much from the beginning.</p><br/><p>Usually the immortality aspect of the players was a huge advantage so the people of the kingdom usually used them by offering them rewards and treasures but the current situation was a bit different.</p><br/><p>So he had remained behind at the War Fortress.</p><br/><p>Enoa shouted towards the Magic Brigade who had been sent out in a hurry from the capital.</p><br/><p>\u201cActivate the Golden Dragon Formation!\u201d</p><br/><p>The members of the Magic Brigade gulped down their saliva and nodded as they started to spread out strange runes into the air.</p><br/><p>The biggest difference between them and the players.</p><br/><p>Technology, learning from experience and preparing for the future.</p><br/><p>This was the reason why they called the players barbarians.</p><br/><p>While those guys were busy living like carnivorous animals day by day.</p><br/><p>They, like how a human should be, had prepared for the future.</p><br/><p>And the Golden Dragon Formation was the result of this.</p><br/><p>A powerful magic formation which allowed them to use the strength of the mana node that held the seal inside the Great Maze.</p><br/><p>But they couldn\u2019t do anything with just this formation alone.</p><br/><p>Since they had no medium that could handle the energy from the mana node.</p><br/><p>There were only 3 items in this world that could withstand such a vast amount of energy.</p><br/><p>So Enoa could only clench his hands into fists and mumble inwardly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hurry...Please hurry with the item, Captain!\u2019</p><br/><p>Boooooom!</p><br/><p>As Enoa mumbled towards the hole into the Great Maze that had been created by melting the surface.</p><br/><p>One of the mages from the Magic Brigade asked quietly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t fail right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Enoa replied with a dumbfounded expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t spout nonsense.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s just...The opponent has the flail so\u2026\u201d.</p><br/><p>The Magic Brigade studied all sorts of history regarding the ancient spells and items.</p><br/><p>Of course they knew about the true power and might of the flail.</p><br/><p>So the mage was worried.</p><br/><p>Enoa shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot even close.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even if the weapon itself was amazing, if the amount of strength of the person used by it was low then its overall strength would be limited as well.</p><br/><p>The flail had tremendous power but a tremendous amount of energy was required to supply it.</p><br/><p>They would only be able to use the true power of the flail when they constructed a giant formation like this and pulled out the energy from the mana node.</p><br/><p>And such a feat, even the Great General Cykrus wouldn\u2019t be able to do it alone.</p><br/><p>The flail in the hands of a human with a level limit of 250 would be negligible.</p><br/><p>\u2018It would just be a somewhat useful weapon.\u2019</p><br/><p>Enoa spoke towards the mage.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you forget who our captain was?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh yeah\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The mage thought of their captain, Arthus Krancheska, and exclaimed out.</p><br/><p>He remembered.</p><br/><p>Arthus Krancheska.</p><br/><p>Captain of the Magic Brigade.</p><br/><p>Owner of the prison with the Destruction Flame.</p><br/><p>Red Dragon Wielder.</p><br/><p>There were countless names and titles given to these people but there was one that stood out the most even out of these.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>A title given to him because of the number of people who had charged at Arthus Krancheska during the 3rd Kingdom War and had been burned up like moths to a flame.</p><br/><p>It was not a title that one could acquire from just having the Destruction Flame.</p><br/><p>\u2018I pray for your soul.\u2019</p><br/><p>Enoa thought of the mysterious thief and mumbled.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Kiiiiiiiiiing.</p><br/><p>\u201cAmazing. It\u2019s really amazing. The power.\u201d</p><br/><p>Arthus Krancheska laughed happily.</p><br/><p>\u2018You dare push me this far?\u2019</p><br/><p>Arthus Krancheska laughed and at the same time mumbled in a dumbfounded manner.</p><br/><p>Level 330.</p><br/><p>It was not a joke.</p><br/><p>A level which far surpassed the immortals.</p><br/><p>Normal attacks wouldn\u2019t work and a simple step of his would cause players to roll away.</p><br/><p>And the skills and the battle experience he had.</p><br/><p>Those player guys didn\u2019t even think of going against him in the first place and Krancheska himself was confident.</p><br/><p>That if he was given a bit of time, he could personally wipe away every player within the War Fortress.</p><br/><p>Once there was enough difference in strength, quantity had no meaning.</p><br/><p>Since they wouldn\u2019t be able to catch him if he ran away and they themselves wouldn\u2019t be able to run away if he chased them.</p><br/><p>There were only 2 reasons why he didn\u2019t fight the bug-like players.</p><br/><p>First, only he would get tired fighting against those guys who had nothing to give him.</p><br/><p>Second, there was no reason to make another enemy.</p><br/><p>He was basically a one man army.</p><br/><p>The guy in front of his eyes should\u2019ve been massacred in under ten seconds.</p><br/><p>But for him to push him this far.</p><br/><p>\u2018For him to be able to push me this far just by having some resentment from the weapon\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>If he wasn\u2019t here then Hansoo would\u2019ve been able to roam through the mass of players and massacre them.</p><br/><p>No, if he actually learnt how to use that flail properly then he might\u2019ve been able to cause him to tremble in fear.</p><br/><p>But sadly for him, this was the end.</p><br/><p>Rumble!</p><br/><p>The Red Dragon Robe around Arthus Krancheska became more solid and started to wrap around the injuries on his body.</p><br/><p>His broken bones were held in place by the robe and the locations which were bleeding had been stopped by the flame of the mana which covered his entire body.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t much mana left in him now.</p><br/><p>There was barely enough to maintain his Dragon Emperor Robe, Spear and Shield.</p><br/><p>Though the Destruction Flame could still let out a lot of flames, there was a limit to his flames.</p><br/><p>But this was more than enough.</p><br/><p>Krancheska lifted the spear with his right hand, the shield with his left and then spoke in a cold manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cTry to struggle a bit more.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Booooooooooooooooom!</p><br/><p>Krancheska jumped up into the air.</p><br/><p>Toooooong!</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh!\u201d</p><br/><p>The red spear cut across the air and smashed into the cloud of flames, the Ain.</p><br/><p>Though he had been injured greatly, he was still very powerful.</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked at the Ain who had been sent flying back and swung his flail around to smash it into Krancheska\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>But this was not enough.</p><br/><p>Normal attacks weren\u2019t enough to penetrate through the Red Dragon Robe surrounding his body tightly.</p><br/><p>Rumble.</p><br/><p>Then, a skill was activated from inside Hansoo\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Arthus Krancheska\u2019s eyes shone brightly and scanned over Hansoo\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Rummblee.</p><br/><p>The mana inside Hansoo\u2019s body, which had been twisting and coiling onto itself, started to disperse into thin strands.</p><br/><p>\u201cKehehe.\u201d</p><br/><p>Krancheska smiled and then focused onto the Ain instead.</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s attacks were useless as long as he could handle his skills.</p><br/><p>And as he expected.</p><br/><p>Boooooom!</p><br/><p>The Forked Lightning smashed onto the Red Dragon Shield and made a huge noise.</p><br/><p>But that was it.</p><br/><p>\u201cUhahahahaha! Try a bit harder!\u201d</p><br/><p>Krancheska defended the attack which was surrounded in the Demonic Dragon\u2019s Reinforcement and then swung his spear around widely.</p><br/><p>Paaa!</p><br/><p>Hansoo sensed the tremendous power behind that attack and quickly backed up as he mumbled.</p><br/><p>\u2018What an annoying skill.\u2019</p><br/><p>The skill which annoyed him even more than the Red Dragon Robe.</p><br/><p>Krancheska has been using it constantly.</p><br/><p>If he didn\u2019t have that skill then he would\u2019ve been destroyed by either the Pandemic Blade or the Nine Dragons Spear earlier.</p><br/><p>There was only one reason why that guy had been able to withstand Hansoo and his own reflected attacks up until now.</p><br/><p>Dragons, the sacred creatures which flew across the heavens, were not something the creatures of the earth could ever fathom to reach.</p><br/><p>And he had pulled down the man who was like a dragon\u2019s avatar from an unreachable position of power to a place where he could just barely handle him by using the Power of the flail.</p><br/><p>But the descended dragon didn\u2019t seem like it would give up that easily.</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>\u201cIiiiikk!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo frowned as he heard the screams of the Ain who was getting beaten up with a shocked expression.</p><br/><p>Dragon\u2019s Eye.</p><br/><p>Well, Red Dragon\u2019s Eye.</p><br/><p>A skill created by a level of mana control which has reached the apex, a tremendous amount of experience and insane calculative abilities.</p><br/><p>Reading the flow of mana inside the opponent\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>And for any skill that has been used at least once, the traces would remain behind.</p><br/><p>Like an answer sheet which had been answered.</p><br/><p>Arthus Krancheska read these traces, read the flow and figured out what the opponent\u2019s skills were.</p><br/><p>He started with this and came up with a plan.</p><br/><p>In order to smash apart his opponent\u2019s skills in the best manner.</p><br/><p>In the most efficient and evil way possible.</p><br/><p>And then he would cut them off from the beginning before they could even begin the skill.</p><br/><p>As long as his opponents were weaker and were inside his range, it was a skill which had a tremendous might.</p><br/><p>Though the amount of actual influence it had on the opponent was low, this was more than enough.</p><br/><p>The moment the complex high level skills got interrupted by this, it would all get tangled up.</p><br/><p>Booooom!</p><br/><p>Krancheska smashed away the Ain and smiled as he started to push Hansoo back.</p><br/><p>As long as he had this skill, any skills would be meaningless.</p><br/><p>Since it would all be read by him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well. It\u2019d probably be quite dangerous.\u2019</p><br/><p>Krancheska mumbled as he saw the flow of mana inside Hansoo\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>He saw quite a few things but there were 2 major skills that could bring him danger.</p><br/><p>One seemed like a close range skill but the other was a very powerful offensive skill.</p><br/><p>If Hansoo had used that skill then he might not have been able to hold on with just his Red Dragon Robe and Shield.</p><br/><p>But he was cancelling all the skills.</p><br/><p>Hansoo would not be able to handle the Red Dragon Robe surrounding his body.</p><br/><p>At least not within the short period of time in which he would get killed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha. You\u2019ve never even heard of this might?\u201d</p><br/><p>A secret weapon that he trusted in and only he knew about.</p><br/><p>This Dragon\u2019s Eye was the proof of his talent.</p><br/><p>As Krancheska smiled and swung his spear.</p><br/><p>Booooom!</p><br/><p>The body which was holding onto the flail and the Forked Lightning got sent flying back.</p><br/><p>At the same time.</p><br/><p>Uuudududuk.</p><br/><p>The flail flew back after blocking the Red Dragon\u2019s Spear.</p><br/><p>Though the flail had withstood the attack, Hansoo\u2019s left arm had not and had been broken.</p><br/><p>Hansoo mumbled.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ve heard of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...What?\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Krancheska replied.</p><br/><p>Whoooosh!</p><br/><p>The Forked Lightning in Hansoo\u2019s right hand flew across the air.</p><br/><p>Towards Krancheska.</p><br/><p>\u2018Heh. What\u2019s he going to do with just this.\u2019</p><br/><p>What could he do with just this single attack.</p><br/><p>Krancheska scoffed at the single attack which was flying towards him.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

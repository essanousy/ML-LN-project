I thought everybody was migrating?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nepallem smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you asking a scientist like me? I\u2019m only responsible for making you and creating the spirits. People who decide how to use them are people like Akamel, the highest-ranked members.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tiamet made a dumbfounded expression.</p><br/><p>Even if people like Akamel could fly, they wouldn\u2019t be able to reach the height Nepallem was at.</p><br/><p>Which meant that Akamel had to present his ideas and receive approval from Nepallem for every plan.</p><br/><p>But for Nepallem to not know what\u2019s going on in a situation like this?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tiamet, who was about to become enraged, realized what he was about to do and then calmed down.</p><br/><p>Why was he getting angry?</p><br/><p>Thinking about it, there was nothing that should matter to him even if the 3rd grade citizens were disposed of.</p><br/><p>Since their deaths didn\u2019t matter to him.</p><br/><p>The 100 or so of the TMT series will be allowed to board and it was better if they didn\u2019t take the 3rd grade citizens.</p><br/><p>Why was there a need to get angry for those who threw eggs at him?</p><br/><p>But something kept tickling him inside his chest.</p><br/><p>Something was complaining inside him.</p><br/><p>And Nepallem smiled as he looked at Tiamet.</p><br/><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you run?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...What do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nepallem patted his chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis. I\u2019m talking about this from before.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>Tiamet realized where the uneasiness and the annoyance was coming from.</p><br/><p>And Nepallem whispered into his ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur TMT-17 is a very precious resource. Adding one extra person wouldn\u2019t be that hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>And the moment he heard this.</p><br/><p>Swoosh.</p><br/><p>Tiamet stomped out from Nepallem\u2019s personal area as he started to walk somewhere.</p><br/><p>And somebody shouted behind his back.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood luck! If you hurry then you might be able to find her before they re-enter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Tiamet disappeared into the darkness and Nepallem shrugged his shoulders inside his own personal area.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, you should at least hear why you\u2019re so special. That\u2019s the most important part.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>[15 minutes until entrance time into Exodus. Citizens, please move to your designated locations.]</p><br/><p>\u201cFinally, we\u2019re going back in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGosh, I thought I was going to die from boredom! Ugh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKeke. I\u2019m going to kill what I was about to before!\u201d</p><br/><p>As the announcement was made, the citizens who were spread out all over the wide underground area started to swarm around the tower.</p><br/><p>Though some were looking at this with a strange expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Astania made a worried expression while looking at the citizens.</p><br/><p>\u2018I know it\u2019s nice but\u2026 Aren\u2019t they relying on it a bit too much?.\u2019</p><br/><p>Astania mumbled to herself.</p><br/><p>She understood that the world inside that place was good.</p><br/><p>Since they were able to forget the problems of reality inside it.</p><br/><p>The 1st grade citizens who wished to rule over them.</p><br/><p>The harsh environment that continuously tried to wipe them out.</p><br/><p>And they, who were powerless to do anything in this situation.</p><br/><p>They were able to forget all of that inside that place.</p><br/><p>No, more than that.</p><br/><p>Unlike this place, where they were powerless, they could become heroes.</p><br/><p>They flew through the skies and hunted dragons.</p><br/><p>They killed beasts and saved others.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Nothing I can do.\u2019</p><br/><p>It looked like they were running away from reality rather than playing a game but she was the same as them.</p><br/><p>Astania sighed as she started to move towards her cell as well.</p><br/><p>But at that moment.</p><br/><p>Somebody grabbed her arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Astania saw a familiar face as she looked behind in confusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026 Hey! I didn\u2019t do anything wrong! Why is a TMT series taking me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Astania shouted in confusion.</p><br/><p>TMT series.</p><br/><p>The beings that were in control of the city\u2019s laws.</p><br/><p>Astania freaked out.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why\u2026 Why is this happening.\u2019</p><br/><p>No matter how she thought about it, she hadn\u2019t done anything wrong.</p><br/><p>Even if she did something wrong, for a TMT to come get her.</p><br/><p>These were not things that should be for that.</p><br/><p>Tiamet frowned as he responded to Astania\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou told me to meet with smiles but the situation is not like that. Follow me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026 Oh. Are you the one from then?\u201d</p><br/><p>Astania then realized something.</p><br/><p>She remembered who this was.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ugh, there\u2019s no way to tell them apart.\u2019</p><br/><p>Astania sighed out in relief but then frowned as she stopped Tiamet and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are you taking me, I have to go in the cell.\u201d</p><br/><p>Astania pointed towards the giant tower filled with glass cells behind her.</p><br/><p>And Tiamet made an annoyed expression at this.</p><br/><p>\u2018This dumb girl. You\u2019re going to die if that happens.\u2019</p><br/><p>The 1st and 2nd grade citizens were going to get on the ship.</p><br/><p>The enhanced race who supplied and controlled the obelisk also had to get on.</p><br/><p>Which meant this giant tower would lose both its software and hardware and would cease to work.</p><br/><p>And the 3rd grade citizens would not be able to survive in these harsh conditions without the protection of the obelisk.</p><br/><p>They would freeze to death inside the glass cells.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you have something to say then say it here. If not then just tell me later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...\u201d</p><br/><p>He wanted to speak but the chipset was preventing him from leaking the top secret informations.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fuck\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Astania frowned and then threw Tiamet\u2019s hands off.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? If you\u2019re going to just play around then fuck off. Are you looking down on me because I\u2019m just a third grade? If I don\u2019t go in there in time then it\u2019ll be bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Astania glared at Tiamet and started to stomp towards the tower.</p><br/><p>Kiigigik.</p><br/><p>Tiamet wanted to grab ahold of Astania but he could not.</p><br/><p>The chipset was stopping him.</p><br/><p>[The enhanced race cannot forcefully act against a citizen.]</p><br/><p>[Stop you actions immediately.]</p><br/><p>The chipset\u2019s electric signal suppressed his entire body as Astania disappeared towards the tower.</p><br/><p>And the various emotions inside him swelled.</p><br/><p>Rage.</p><br/><p>Pity.</p><br/><p>And\u2026</p><br/><p>Tiamet clenched his teeth and poured strength all over his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh\u2026.Fu..cking...Hell!\u201d</p><br/><p>Craack.</p><br/><p>Crunch.</p><br/><p>At that moment, something shocking occurred.</p><br/><p>Tiamet started to move despite the chipset suppression.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Please!\u2019</p><br/><p>As his body moved.</p><br/><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><br/><p>Tiamet didn\u2019t pay attention to the fact that he could ignore the chipset as he started to rush towards Astania with an urgent expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Astania freaked out at Tiamet who rushed up to her.</p><br/><p>Smack!</p><br/><p>Astania fell on the ground unconscious as Tiamet hit her in the back of her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaa...Ha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Strangely, the chipset had stopped suppressing him as Tiamet attained his goal.</p><br/><p>Tiamet breathed out roughly as he stared down at Astania who was laid out on the ground.</p><br/><p>He then heaved her onto his shoulders and quickly ran over to the elevator.</p><br/><p>\u2018I need to hurry.\u2019</p><br/><p>The train to the spaceship would soon set off.</p><br/><p>As he got on the elevator the sensor inside it started to scan him.</p><br/><p>[...Scanning.]</p><br/><p>[...TMT-17. Scan complete. Activating.]</p><br/><p>Ooooong!</p><br/><p>Tiamet glanced at the countless 3rd grade citizens lying in the glass cells in the distance but soon turned away from them as the elevator started to climb up.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>[Everyone, proceed to board starting from the citizens of Zone 19 please.]</p><br/><p>[You\u2019ve done well until now, congratulations on obtaining the right to go to the new world.]</p><br/><p>The 1st level station of the obelisk.</p><br/><p>Countless people were climbing aboard the long train.</p><br/><p>Most were the 1st grade citizens of the obelisk.</p><br/><p>And around the 1st grade citizens.</p><br/><p>The various enhanced race members were getting on board along with the citizens.</p><br/><p>Akamel looked at the scene from the corner of the station next to two TMTs.</p><br/><p>\u2018Good. Perfect.\u2019</p><br/><p>The boarding of the citizens from the city was proceeding smoothly as the Mudusella System was being moved onto the spaceship.</p><br/><p>Though it might not be as good as the Mudusella system that used the souls of the 20 million people, it would be more than enough.</p><br/><p>Since the number of citizens would naturally rise once they colonize the new planet properly.</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>[Warning! Warning!]</p><br/><p>[Unknown citizen is attempting to board.]</p><br/><p>[All enhanced race of cart A-22, proceed to prevent the boarding.]</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Akamel frowned at the sudden warning.</p><br/><p>\u2018No way\u2026 All the 3rd grade citizens should be inside Exodus by now.\u2019</p><br/><p>The 3rd grade citizens of the 17th zone who had been awakened just recently were also going into Exodus.</p><br/><p>And they couldn\u2019t use the elevators even if they were awake so who was trying to come.</p><br/><p>\u2018...What\u2019s going on.\u2019</p><br/><p>Akamel frowned as he took the two TMTs and headed towards the location of conflict.</p><br/><p>Booom!</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>Sounds of collisions could be heard around the station.</p><br/><p>\u2018Who caused this\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Akamel approached the area with a confused expression but then made a dumbfounded expression at the scene.</p><br/><p>Various enhanced race members had been flung back.</p><br/><p>And the one TMT series who had a girl on his back.</p><br/><p>Akamel realized what was going on the moment he saw this and then grinded his teeth.</p><br/><p>\u201c...Nepallem. No matter how much you try to stop me this time, it won\u2019t work.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Fucking bastards. I\u2019ll make sure to tighten your collars properly after this.\u2019</p><br/><p>And at that moment.</p><br/><p>TMT-17, the one who had created all this mess, stomped towards Akamel.</p><br/><p>\u2018This bastard\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>As Akamel glared at Tiamet.</p><br/><p>Tiamet pondered for a moment but then spoke straightforwardly.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease let this woman onboard.\u201d</p><br/><p>His demand wasn\u2019t very far-fetched.</p><br/><p>His own worth was extremely high and though he didn\u2019t know why they were leaving behind the 3rd grade citizens, adding one extra woman wasn\u2019t hard for Akamel.</p><br/><p>This was why he had left behind the other citizens.</p><br/><p>Since if they started to cling onto him he might not be able to save the woman.</p><br/><p>\u2018Though you won\u2019t be treated well after you get on...You should at least live.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tiamet mumbled as he glanced at Astania.</p><br/><p>But from the distance.</p><br/><p>MSL-17, Mudusella, saw this scene with a sad expression.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tiamet\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>She understood what he was thinking.</p><br/><p>But sadly, Tiamet didn\u2019t understand the humans enough.</p><br/><p>To be precise, the dark parts of their emotions.</p><br/><p>And just like she expected.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><br/><p>Akamel scoffed as he replied.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk, Tsk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nepallem looked at this scene from the distance and clicked his tongue.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

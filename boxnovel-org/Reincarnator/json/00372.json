It\u2019s a fun story. Melchizedek took one of the bodies from that race and went up. It was too much of a waste to use it as fodder and throw it away.\u201d</p><br/><p>N-Akuon nodded.</p><br/><p>If it was really a race as powerful as that, even a corpse was valuable.</p><br/><p>But it wouldn't be as good as a live one.</p><br/><p>There was still a question in his mind.</p><br/><p>\u201c...What will it do with the body?\u201d</p><br/><p>N-Aroel shrugged his shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe use it to turn the situation around? You see, it\u2019s not in the greatest position right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot in a good position? Hmm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>N-Akuon could not understand the meaning behind that.</p><br/><p>According to what he\u2019d heard, Melchizedek had prepared meticulously.</p><br/><p>It had succeeded in the rebellion, swept away the civilians of Angkara, and gained control over Nelkipa.</p><br/><p>For someone who controlled that strange insectoid race, what could it have issues with?</p><br/><p>N-Aroel smiled at N-Akuon\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you see that over there? That cannon-like thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>N-Akuon peeked his head out and looked out of the ship to the place N-Aroel was pointing to.</p><br/><p>N-Aroel\u2019s finger was pointing directly at the Nelkipa.</p><br/><p>The spikes at the back of Nelkipa to be exact.</p><br/><p>They called them spikes relative to the whole of Nelkipa, but those things were dozens of kilometers tall at least.</p><br/><p>That size was actually comparable, or even taller, to the skyscrapers in Angkara.</p><br/><p>It had a strange design as well.</p><br/><p>N-Akuon was at a loss as he looked at the metallic spikes\u2014each of them seemed to have a hole in the center.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way\u2026 Is that really a weapon?\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the technicians of the fleet had actually come up with a theory.</p><br/><p>That those spikes could be weapons.</p><br/><p>But that theory was soon ignored.</p><br/><p>Because of one reason.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that was a weapon, why isn\u2019t Melchizedek using it?\u201d</p><br/><p>N-Akuon asked N-Aroel fervently.</p><br/><p>Well, it was more of a fear-stricken expression.</p><br/><p>Of course.</p><br/><p>That giant creature and the giant cannon.</p><br/><p>The energy felt from within it was endless.</p><br/><p>If that thing started firing at them, then both the fleets and the planet of Angkara wouldn\u2019t be able to escape from turning into a sea of flames.</p><br/><p>He could only feel fear.</p><br/><p>So he had ignored that possibility.</p><br/><p>If that was a weapon, why wasn\u2019t Melchizedek retaliating after they attacked with Photon Strikes?</p><br/><p>\u2014boomboobooom\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014booboom\u2014 </p><br/><p>N-Akuon looked at the giant creature that was flying through the countless rays of Photon Strikes as if they were just a light drizzle.</p><br/><p>\u201cBingo. That\u2019s the important part. Do you know why it isn\u2019t attacking?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...Tell me.\u201d</p><br/><p>A part of him wanted to guess it as a challenge, but he was truly desperate for the answer.</p><br/><p>N-Aroel looked at N-Akuon\u2019s thirsty expression and smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because Melchizedek doesn\u2019t have complete control over Nelkipa.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s why Melchizedek needs to turn the situation around. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019ll do though.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Another question appeared inside N-Akuon\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>He no longer cared about how Melchizedek would use that new race\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Something that he was even more curious about had popped up.</p><br/><p>\u201c...Who? Who\u2019s causing Melchizedek this much trouble?\u201d</p><br/><p>Who had the power to?</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>N-Aroel chuckled as he scanned the Nelkipa below.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014 </p><br/><p>At the head of the giant Nelkipa.</p><br/><p>Roaaaar</p><br/><p>One man listened to the cries of the Nelkipa, which was maintaining its course towards Angkara despite the countless artillery shells smashing onto its body, and he cursed out loud.</p><br/><p>\u201cF***ing hell. I don\u2019t even know why they fire these things when they don\u2019t work anyway. Annoying.\u201d</p><br/><p>Countless artillery shells were continuously raining down on him.</p><br/><p>Not that it mattered.</p><br/><p>\u2014boom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>A Photon Strike slammed onto the man, but he just dusted himself off in an annoyed manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it. I hate saunas.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Photon Strike that had even burned Hansoo at the 2-Star level didn\u2019t leave a single scratch on that man.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t like the man was covered in the nano-coating anyway.</p><br/><p>The man had easily blocked off the artillery shells with a thin mana barrier above his skin. He spoke to the woman standing next to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, could you stop that?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man looked perplexed at the woman next to him, who was stabbing herself with a strange spike.</p><br/><p>Despite the spike puncturing her skin and causing her to bleed, she continued her actions with a dull expression.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ugh, I can never get used to that.\u2019</p><br/><p>The woman snapped in anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up, don\u2019t meddle in my hobbies. Focus on how you\u2019re going to deal with that thing instead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...I don\u2019t think I can do anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014oooooong\u2014 </p><br/><p>The man, Ares Valentine, mumbled as he looked at the groups of soldiers marching around the giant fortress in the distance.</p><br/><p>Of course, those little toys couldn\u2019t stop them.</p><br/><p>They could rip them apart like paper.</p><br/><p>But the issue was the ones behind them.</p><br/><p>2-Star Transcendents that had been modified and even equipped with armor.</p><br/><p>As well as the tremendous amount of energy supplied from the crystal in Aokan.</p><br/><p>\u2018No, the crystal in there is even bigger than the crystal in Aokan.\u2019</p><br/><p>Ares Valentine frowned.</p><br/><p>The main crystal of the Nelkipa\u2014the core that supplied it with energy.</p><br/><p>And the modified transcendents that were setting up defenses using the energy from the crystal.</p><br/><p>Even if they were 3-Star Transcendents, they\u2019d end up as a couple of rags once they stepped in there.</p><br/><p>Elis Valentine, the woman who was listening to Ares\u2019s words, frowned as she snapped again.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I said we should\u2019ve taken that first, you dumb bastard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...How could I have known this would happen? And I thought this was all we needed.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man looked at the giant crystal behind him.</p><br/><p>\u2014oooooong\u2014 </p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t as large as the main crystal, but it was much larger than the one below Aokan.</p><br/><p>One main crystal.</p><br/><p>The sub-crystal behind him and the one in the distance that Elis Valentine was defending.</p><br/><p>These three crystals were the main control centers of Nelkipa.</p><br/><p>\u2018All this energy\u2026 just to provide enough energy to control this thing.\u2019</p><br/><p>Ares was at a loss.</p><br/><p>The energy that he could feel from the crystal behind him was something that even he, a 3-Star Transcendent, feared slightly.</p><br/><p>And all this energy was just a tiny fraction that came out from the artificial core of the Nelkipa.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn. We have to take control over this Nelkipa\u2026 Or if we can find the method to control all this energy.\u2019</p><br/><p>Ares Valentine frowned and felt regret.</p><br/><p>They had looked down on Melchizedek a bit too much.</p><br/><p>They\u2019d thought that they could easily deal with Melchizedek\u2019s toys, and then shred apart Kang Hansoo since they were both 3-Star Transcendents.</p><br/><p>But after prying into the whole thing, what was all this?</p><br/><p>Melchizedek had used its intensive knowledge and control over this giant creature to arm its underlings.</p><br/><p>And as a result, they couldn\u2019t even approach the main crystal and were tied down trying to protect the two sub-crystals.</p><br/><p>\u2018Should I have studied instead of just fighting all the time?\u2019</p><br/><p>Ares Valentine lamented as he looked at the crystal behind him.</p><br/><p>If he knew how to control this energy, then he would\u2019ve long since charged in there and crushed Melchizedek\u2019s skull.</p><br/><p>The energy behind him was more than enough to do that.</p><br/><p>Of course, something like that wasn\u2019t possible for him.</p><br/><p>This was not something one could do with a short amount of studying.</p><br/><p>Only something like Melchizedek would be able to.</p><br/><p>\u2018I need to accept what I have to accept.\u2019</p><br/><p>Ares Valentine looked at his twin sister, Elis Valentine, and asked:</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u2019</p><br/><p>Elis Valentine pointed towards Melchizedek\u2019s fortress in the distance and replied:</p><br/><p>\u201cWe might have the strength to defend all of this, but nothing will change if we just stick around here, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMhm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd charging in there will be a piece of cake?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYup.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cSo taking control of the Nelkipa is the same as well?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elis clapped lightly and then replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, let\u2019s begin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ares made a flustered expression.</p><br/><p>There was only one thing they could do now.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou start first. I\u2019ll join you soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I won\u2019t see you off. Take care.\u201d</p><br/><p>With these words\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014booooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014Elis\u2019s body quickly disappeared towards the crystal in the distance.</p><br/><p>Ares shrugged at this scene and then moved towards the sub-crystal behind him.</p><br/><p>\u2014oooooooong!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The crystal that was overflowing with energy.</p><br/><p>He had no way to control this energy at the moment.</p><br/><p>It was too much for him to handle.</p><br/><p>Melchizedek might be able to use it with its amazing technology, but he didn\u2019t have a talent like that.</p><br/><p>\u2018Maybe if I had the Acknowledgement.\u2019</p><br/><p>Well, the thing he was about to do didn\u2019t really require him to control this energy.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s see\u2026 Time for some fireworks before I go up.\u2019</p><br/><p>Ares chuckled coldly.</p><br/><p>He\u2019d tried so hard to keep this crystal, but if he couldn\u2019t then it was better to destroy it.</p><br/><p>And soon\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014boooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014a tremendous amount of energy extended out from Ares\u2019s body and shook the crystal.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u201cI expected a greeting party, but it looks like that\u2019s not happening.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I expected them to do something as soon as we arrived.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiriel and Enbi Arin were at a loss as they walked out from the giant elevator.</p><br/><p>They had prepared themselves for the worst, but nothing was here.</p><br/><p>But this only lasted for a moment.</p><br/><p>\u2014boooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Kiriel and Enbi Arin quickly woke up from their delusions.</p><br/><p>It was not the time to let down their guard.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese crazy bastards\u2026 What the hell are they doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>This tremendous aura.</p><br/><p>Two overbearing auras exploded out from the giant plane on the Nelkipa\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>From two edges of the plane.</p><br/><p>No, it wasn\u2019t just two.</p><br/><p>\u2014boooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>As two auras exploded out from two sides of the plane, another aura that was as big as both of them combined exploded out from between them.</p><br/><p>Three energies ruptured outwards like the eruption of a volcano.</p><br/><p>The tremendous amount of energy pushed against their skin, and Hansoo mumbled:</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess they didn\u2019t have time to. They seem to be busy with their own jobs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time\u2026 for us to do our jobs as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo mumbled as he looked at the three giant auras exploding around them.</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014 </p><br/><p>Roaaaar!</p><br/><p>The Nelkipa, which had been ignoring the countless artillery shells, started to cry out.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Amazing. What armor is that?]</p><br/><p>[His spear and skills are amazing too. Why has nobody found him before? Has anyone seen him before?]</p><br/><p>[Our lives could flip for the better if we catch him. We might even be able to buy an entire house if we sell his stuff to some rich boys.]</p><br/><p>[His control is fucking beyond hacking. Clearly a hacker. Damn, the hacks these days are good.]</p><br/><p>[Hey! He\u2019s in the Great Maze! Let\u2019s go get him!]</p><br/><p>[Ugh! They\u2019ve blocked the entrance at the moment. The ones inside really hit a jackpot huh.]</p><br/><p>Flame Warrior-V smiled from the reaction.</p><br/><p>\u2018Good. Perfect.\u2019</p><br/><p>Blackist.</p><br/><p>A killer list sent out by the group.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t much.</p><br/><p>They would just upload somebody\u2019s name and an image to a site anybody could access and spread the information.</p><br/><p>It was a list created in case the bug killers lost their target.</p><br/><p>Once somebody appeared on that list, they would get chased by everyone in Exodus.</p><br/><p>Until they die.</p><br/><p>\u2018Now\u2026 It doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re a player or a bug player.\u2019</p><br/><p>The important thing was fucking him over.</p><br/><p>The blacklist was more than enough.</p><br/><p>Since somebody\u2019s name in the blacklist would stay until they died once.</p><br/><p>A rumor about somebody being a bug player would spread extremely quickly but information clearing their name would not spread as fast.</p><br/><p>As a result the player would die tens of times over and even more if they were unlucky, there was no better revenge than this.</p><br/><p>And because he could get cursed at a lot for this he didn\u2019t put up names randomly but it was different for somebody like him.</p><br/><p>For him to cause this much damage as well as being suspicious.</p><br/><p>Since there were so many witnesses, the job had been accomplished quickly and this was the result.</p><br/><p>Flame Warrior-V laughed coldly as he looked at the views that were increasing super quickly.</p><br/><p>Even if he survived down below, he would die eventually.</p><br/><p>But as Flame Warrior-V was laughing in contentment.</p><br/><p>Ring!</p><br/><p>A strange noise rang out and a message arrived for Flame Warrior-V.</p><br/><p>\u2018What is this?\u2019</p><br/><p>Flame Warrior-V opened up the message with a confused expression and then suddenly the color was drained from his face.</p><br/><p>\u2018Clan master?\u2019</p><br/><p>Though they were in the same clan, there was a huge difference in rank between him and the clan master.</p><br/><p>Flame Warrior-V made a terrified expression as he looked at the message that he had just received.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d</p><br/><p>Booom!</p><br/><p>Crunch!</p><br/><p>Christopher clenched his teeth and swung his sword at the players who were attacking him.</p><br/><p>If only he hadn\u2019t been turned into a mess by the bug killers and players who chased him.</p><br/><p>As he was bleeding, countless people were charging towards him.</p><br/><p>People who didn\u2019t have any fear since they didn\u2019t have to fear death.</p><br/><p>If he didn\u2019t know they were going after him and had been ambushed then he might not even be standing here like this.</p><br/><p>Booom!</p><br/><p>Crunch!</p><br/><p>Christopher smashed apart a head of a player charging towards him with a short sword and the grinded his teeth.</p><br/><p>\u2018Blacklist, such a thing existed?\u2019</p><br/><p>The final tactic of the bug killers who loved monopolizing things.</p><br/><p>With this, they would forever become runaways.</p><br/><p>Until they left this damned place.</p><br/><p>\u2018No, I shouldn\u2019t worry about this.\u2019</p><br/><p>There were blades coming for his neck at this instant.</p><br/><p>As Christopher rebalanced himself and was about to attack the next person charging at him.</p><br/><p>Whoooosh.</p><br/><p>The red cloud around Christopher suddenly spread in all directions.</p><br/><p>\u2018Huaaak!\u2019</p><br/><p>Christopher freaked out at the cloud which had appeared without a trace.</p><br/><p>He sensed it due to being sensitive to mana.</p><br/><p>He felt the viciousness and mana within every molecule which made up the cloud.</p><br/><p>It felt like being thrown into a pit full of man eating ants.</p><br/><p>And as he looked around.</p><br/><p>\u201cUuuu\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuuk.\u201d</p><br/><p>His comrades, who were sensitive to the deadly aura, were shaking from head to toe even while fighting.</p><br/><p>And the players mumbled with confused expressions.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Did something happen? Why are they like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKeke. Maybe they finally figured out what is going on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Christopher cursed out as he looked at the players who were charging in ruthlessly.</p><br/><p>The players, who couldn\u2019t detect the deadliness of the strange powder, were wary at first but soon reazlied it wasn\u2019t harmful as they charged through the cloud.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fuck. Thank god their perception is so dull.\u2019</p><br/><p>If something like this surrounded somebody, it was normal to have difficulty even moving.</p><br/><p>Since it felt like their entire body would melt down and disintegrate the moment they moved.</p><br/><p>One could clearly see where this red cloud originated from.</p><br/><p>But the deathly aura within this powder did not reassure them at all.</p><br/><p>It was as if this was the end result of something created for one objective, it was like mass murder having a physical incarnation.</p><br/><p>His entire body shook as floods of sweat ran down his entire body and his instincts literally screamed at him to run the hell away from this.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ugh\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>But Christopher groaned as he moved his arm.</p><br/><p>There was nowhere to run and he couldn\u2019t just die by getting hit by a blade while standing still.</p><br/><p>The problem was that his reaction was too slow.</p><br/><p>Chwaaaak!</p><br/><p>\u201cOh yeah! This artifact is mine!\u201d</p><br/><p>A player had already arrived before him and had smashed down his axe.</p><br/><p>It was too hard to block and the enemy was too close for him to dodge.</p><br/><p>Christopher clenched his teeth at the axe that was approaching him and then raised his right arm.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t give up his life this easily.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fuck. For me to lose my life this easily\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Christopher made a helpless expression while lifting his arm.</p><br/><p>For his sensitive perception, which had saved his life countless times until now, to have failed him this time.</p><br/><p>If he wasn\u2019t able to sense the deathly aura like the players then he wouldn\u2019t have turned out like this.</p><br/><p>Crunch!</p><br/><p>As the axe broke through the armor on Christopher\u2019s arm and was about to dig into his flesh.</p><br/><p>Shaaaaaaak.</p><br/><p>The red cloud which had extended out from Hansoo\u2019s body started to madly stick onto the bodies of players.</p><br/><p>Only the players.</p><br/><p>Chwaaat!</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even before the players could voice their shock from the red cloud which had suddenly stuck onto them.</p><br/><p>Swooooosh.</p><br/><p>The player\u2019s entire bodies started to melt.</p><br/><p>Starting from the right hand of the player who had swung his axe to cut off Christopher\u2019s arm.</p><br/><p>To the legs of the players who had been charging towards him to stop the monopolization.</p><br/><p>The players stopped as they saw their bodies melting down, finally realized the situation and started to scream out.</p><br/><p>\u201cUwaaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the fuck! What the hell is this!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if he\u2019s hacking this is too much!\u201d</p><br/><p>The players cursed out as they saw their bodies disintegrating and disappearing.</p><br/><p>Every time the red powder dug in, their bodies turned more and more golden and disappeared.</p><br/><p>The screams only lasted a moment.</p><br/><p>Chwaaaarrrrk.</p><br/><p>Even before a second was up,their bodies all disappeared with a golden flash.</p><br/><p>Everyone who had filled up the space around the azure marble which connected the 1st and 2nd floors of the maze had disappeared.</p><br/><p>Only Hansoo and the other adventurers had been left.</p><br/><p>Pat.</p><br/><p>As Christopher and the other adventurers watched the players disappear, their legs all gave out and they fell onto their butts.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t because the players had disappeared.</p><br/><p>It was because they felt like they had escaped the mouth of a terrifying beast as the red powder which had filled this entire space disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaa\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPhew\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Christopher and Ellenoia sighed out loud, the other adventurers sighed out as well as if they had returned to reality and everyone then turned to look at Hansoo.</p><br/><p>He looked quite tired as if there was a bit of strain on his mana but he still looked healthy.</p><br/><p>Christopher asked himself in confusion.</p><br/><p>\u2018...That strange dragon alone was amazing but what the hell is this. Where the hell do you get skills like this.\u2019</p><br/><p>The amount of mana he had to use that skill was amazing but the skill itself was terrifying.</p><br/><p>If one could have the same result just by pouring in mana then the players wouldn\u2019t have fought head over heels for good skills.</p><br/><p>\u2018Did that trait of his guide him? To the places where he could get them?\u2019</p><br/><p>Suddenly Christopher felt sad.</p><br/><p>If he had such strength or had the ability which guided him to places with such rewards then he would\u2019ve been much stronger than now and could\u2019ve done much more.</p><br/><p>But he soon shook his head.</p><br/><p>The strong weren\u2019t created from luck.</p><br/><p>Since the ones who got strong by luck were merely fertilizer for the truly strong.</p><br/><p>Only those who can smash through danger with their own abilities and jump into such dangers in order to proceed could capture such rewards and become somebody strong.</p><br/><p>Like a single powerful blade which had been tempered tens of thousands of times.</p><br/><p>For him to be jealous of his trait when he couldn\u2019t even fathom where that man had gone to in order to earn those skills and that power.</p><br/><p>\u2018Even if I knew, could I have done it?\u2019</p><br/><p>Christopher shook his head as he looked at Hansoo.</p><br/><p>It was impossible for himself, he always found the safest paths since he was afraid of death.</p><br/><p>Even if he knew the answer.</p><br/><p>Knowing the path and going through the path were two completely different things.</p><br/><p>\u2018But\u2026 I should be able to follow him around and help him.\u2019</p><br/><p>As Christopher got up from his spot and looked around.</p><br/><p>Something squirmed and got up.</p><br/><p>While making a strange noise.</p><br/><p>\u201cHhuuuuuuuhhhh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Christopher\u2019s eyebrows twitched.</p><br/><p>It was not his comrade.</p><br/><p>Which means it was a player.</p><br/><p>\u2018Somebody\u2019s still alive huh.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo might not have been able to finish him off because he didn\u2019t have mana.</p><br/><p>Since he looked quite tired after using that skill.</p><br/><p>But it didn\u2019t matter.</p><br/><p>\u2018I can finish him off.\u2019</p><br/><p>Clank.</p><br/><p>Christopher clenched onto his short sword and then headed towards the person who was squirming in the distance.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>The one who had been groaning suddenly stood up as he looked at Christopher and shouted</p><br/><p>\u201cWoah woah woah! Wait! Wait! No! I\u2019m not a player! Isn\u2019t that why you didn\u2019t kill me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018...Adventurer? He\u2019s one of us?\u2019</p><br/><p>Christopher frowned as he looked at the man speaking out.</p><br/><p>Hansoo made a shocked expression.</p><br/><p>\u2018An unexpected catch.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was clear where this adventurer came from if he was hiding his identity here.</p><br/><p>As Hansoo mumbled and looked at the adventurer who was probably a part of that clan.</p><br/><p>Rumble.</p><br/><p>A faint tremor rang throughout the maze.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Oooooong.</p><br/><p>\u2018....Great Magic Formation?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo frowned as he looked at the skull in his possession which had started to shine.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

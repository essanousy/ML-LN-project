He\u2019s a real talent huh.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo clicked his tongue.</p><br/><p>They could choose because the structure of the tower was unique.</p><br/><p>To either move in small groups or in large groups.</p><br/><p>And a fitting difficulty and reward is prepared from that.</p><br/><p>Normal clan lords would try to move by combining all their forces.</p><br/><p>Since they had done so until now and since it was safer this way.</p><br/><p>But this guy was different.</p><br/><p>With such thoughts he splits up his clansmen and then mixes them in between other adventurers.</p><br/><p>A method that was possible because he was confident in each individual member\u2019s abilities and because they could communicate with each other no matter where they were in the tower.</p><br/><p>It would actually be eye catching if they were to move in groups but moving in small killer squads allowed them for them to pretend they\u2019re normal adventurers between other people and then wipe them off during decisive moments.</p><br/><p>People who had died from the Dark Mad Lord\u2019s small killer squads had numbered over a thousand in the past and these killer squads had monopolized around 1000 people\u2019s worth of artifacts and runes and had reached a point where they could openly massacre people and no one could do anything to them.</p><br/><p>Since they were all separated he had to find and kill them off one by one as he climbed.</p><br/><p>There was no need to look out for his image because he had transformed himself, but he hadn\u2019t done this to just kill normal adventurers to turn them into runes.</p><br/><p>He had changed in order to get as close as he could to the Dark Mad Lord, who knows of his appearance, to cut off his neck in a single swipe.</p><br/><p>\u2018It won\u2019t take that long.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo thought of this and that and laughed coldly as he slowly walked towards the tower.</p><br/><p>After a long walk the people inside the Tower greeted Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cA newcomer has come. I\u2019m called Suhan. What about you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo made a befuddled expression at the words of the man in the front.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ah. I have to choose a name.\u2019</p><br/><p>Since he was a different person he had to make a separate name.</p><br/><p>Since he wasn\u2019t Kang Hansoo anymore.</p><br/><p>Hansoo laughed as he spoke his name.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy name is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that the tower\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Chulman frowned as he looked at the giant tower in the distance.</p><br/><p>How hard had it been getting to this point.</p><br/><p>Chulman looked around him cautiously as he walked.</p><br/><p>At the same time he glanced at the giant tower in front of his eyes.</p><br/><p>Giant Tower.</p><br/><p>Many entrances existed in all directions but not many differences could be seen.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026 Do I just need to go in?\u2019</p><br/><p>Chulam chose one of them and then headed in carefully.</p><br/><p>The passageway was long which was befitting of the giant tower.</p><br/><p>As he followed the tunnel in, a giant circular plaza came out.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026This is?\u2019</p><br/><p>Chulman checked his surroundings instinctively.</p><br/><p>Hundreds of entrances had surrounded the plaza and a few of them already had closed doors.</p><br/><p>And above the entrance there were various numbers.</p><br/><p>Some said 1 and others said 50.</p><br/><p>Some big ones even said 80.</p><br/><p>Similarities between them was that to the inside of the entrance was not a passageway but rather a small room.</p><br/><p>\u2018What is this\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>But that wasn\u2019t the only peculiar part.</p><br/><p>People who had grouped up in the corner.</p><br/><p>\u20189 people.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was only 9 but he couldn\u2019t let his guards drop.</p><br/><p>Whilst Chulman was on guard the guy in the very front spoke out as he looked at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so anxious. We\u2019re meeting each other for the first time here too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>The others couldn\u2019t drop their guards but had their curiosity perked at these words.</p><br/><p>What was the reason for 9 strangers to group up.</p><br/><p>And the fact that 9 people were mixed into the group was also strange.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you gathered so?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man who was standing in the front, Suhan, replied at Chulman\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m called Suhan, well\u2026 since you\u2019re alone I can guess to some extent. There\u2019s really nobody you can trust huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chulman frowned at these words.</p><br/><p>Correct.</p><br/><p>He had felt this while going up the other islands.</p><br/><p>That there was really nobody he could trust.</p><br/><p>No, this damnable fairy had made it so.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t resent it.</p><br/><p>They only had one life, who in the world would give up their life for somebody else.</p><br/><p>Since he was like that too.</p><br/><p>Suhan smiled as he looked at Chulman.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut what do we do. It seems we have to group up again no matter what. You\u2019re the tenth person. It said we needed one more person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c?\u201d</p><br/><p>While Chulman was making a confused expression, the fairy appeared in the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cI welcome you to the tower. Heehee. This is a land of opportunity. Of course everywhere in the tutorial is like that but this place is even more so.\u201d</p><br/><p>And at that moment a small map had appeared within Chulman\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Information about the hundreds of doors nearby was written on it.</p><br/><p> (Closed)</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>(Closed)</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>(Closed)</p><br/><p>(Closed)</p><br/><p>By pressing it he could even read descriptions about the options on these.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026 King\u2019s Sword? Diving Wrath? They even give this? Isn\u2019t this a bit too much.\u2019</p><br/><p>While Chuman made a flustered expression the fairy smiled as it spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a friendly care for you guys. You\u2019ve seen instances of people moving in large groups in the islands below right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chulman nodded his head.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn\u2026 that\u2019s really out of the norm. How do you want us to go against such things.\u2019</p><br/><p>Clan Lord.</p><br/><p>Their psychic power was fascinating itself but it was also very superior.</p><br/><p>50 to 100 people moved about in groups, how did they expect them to win against that.</p><br/><p>He had gone through two islands on the way here and one of them had a Lord on the island.</p><br/><p>It was an island that could hold 100 people but the whole time while he was there the island was basically controlled by the Lord who lead 50 people.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was watching from above but phew. How would the people traveling alone live from such sorrows? So we prepared this for you. This way you won\u2019t be in a disadvantage because you lack numbers right?\u201d</p><br/><p>He realized it then.</p><br/><p>What the 2 Man Room and 3 Man Rooms meant.</p><br/><p>A game which could be played with 2 people, a game which could be played with 3 people.</p><br/><p>\u2018Clearly\u2026 if you were to do this then the chances of going against clans go down substantially.\u2019</p><br/><p>It seemed like large rooms such as 80 Man Rooms were rooms that clans had targeted and entered.</p><br/><p>Since it was that dangerous but had enormous rewards to go with it.</p><br/><p>The 2 Man Rooms or 3 Man Rooms seemed like they were all closed due to people coming ahead but rooms such as 10 man rooms were still left.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is what they meant when they said when they were waiting for me.\u2019</p><br/><p>They wanted to go into the 10 Man Room but they couldn\u2019t because 1 was lacking.</p><br/><p>But Chulman looked at the fairy with an extremely suspicious expression.</p><br/><p>\u2018These flies are friendly huh?\u2019</p><br/><p>How could they be.</p><br/><p>But at that moment he heard Suhan\u2019s voice calling at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no point of pondering over it. Since the lowest one right now is the 10 man Room.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As if the people ahead of them had similar thoughts, all the 2 Man to 9 Man Rooms were long closed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well\u2026 Since they could enter by gathering for a small time it would\u2019ve been filled up quickly.\u2019</p><br/><p>He was alone.</p><br/><p>The 10 Man Room was the least burdensome.</p><br/><p>If he missed this chance and were to enter a 11 Man Room with a group of 3-4 people then it would be extremely hard on him.</p><br/><p>\u2018There\u2019s no way that it wouldn\u2019t have set something up.\u2019</p><br/><p>Chulman nodded his head as he went into the room which had written on the entrance along with the nine people.</p><br/><p>As 10 people got into the room the doors made a grinding noise as they closed.</p><br/><p>Kuguguguuung.</p><br/><p>And soon the small room with 10 people moved about aggressively as it started to dig deep into the tower.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Kyaaaaak!</p><br/><p>Kudududk.</p><br/><p>Chulman cut off the neck of the Beast which was charging at him.</p><br/><p>The beast which had the shape of a red ant spat out a rune after having its head cut off by Chulman\u2019s black medium sized Greatsword.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s see. Did he say we should get the things from whatever we killed ourselves?\u2019</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t drop his guard against the nine of them even whilst he was hunting.</p><br/><p>At the same time he was inspecting them the whole time.</p><br/><p>\u2018First\u2026 it seems like these guys know how to play as a team.\u2019</p><br/><p>Maybe it was because they were cautious of each other or they had decided that it wasn\u2019t the time for them to fight each other but a clear rule was set between the 10 of them.</p><br/><p>The two basic rules which said that they had to fight in the front and distribution of runes and artifacts were according to their contributions.</p><br/><p>\u2018As I expected\u2026 there\u2019s a difference in levels.\u2019</p><br/><p>The three which were composed of two men including Suhan and a female were really strong.</p><br/><p>Since it looked like the 7 others could not beat these three.</p><br/><p>\u2018That guy called Youngjae is strong too\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>The four including himself were at a decent level.</p><br/><p>There were three of them who were weaker than him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Thankfully there isn\u2019t anyone who wants to take over because they\u2019re strong\u2026 and the girls are fighting well too.\u2019</p><br/><p>Being a female did not mean they were weak.</p><br/><p>No, the fact that their poisonous aura could be felt at every swing of their sword showed how hard it was to get to this point.</p><br/><p>But then a thought came up in Chulman\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026 This is too simple.\u2019</p><br/><p>Of course he didn\u2019t mean the difficulty itself was hard.</p><br/><p>Since if it was that easy then it wouldn\u2019t have taken them a while day to get here.</p><br/><p>Just like the name of the 10 Man Room, the difficulty was set so 10 people needed to work well with each other in order to clear it.</p><br/><p>It would\u2019ve been hard on them if they had 8 or 9.</p><br/><p>The difficulty played a huge role to the fact that they were all keeping by the rules while advancing forward.</p><br/><p>If it was too hard or too easy then the relationship between the people would be much worse than it is now.</p><br/><p>Since a person would have separate thoughts when they were in dire situations or had leisure.</p><br/><p>But because of this they felt much more at ease.</p><br/><p>\u2018The fairy didn\u2019t set anything up?\u2019</p><br/><p>While Chulman was surprised Suhan swung his sword while shouting energetically.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like all ten of us could survive this way? Let\u2019s stay strong!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chulman nodded at these words.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yeah. Let\u2019s first focus on advancing forward.\u2019</p><br/><p>Who would enjoy killing and stealing things from them.</p><br/><p>If they could combine their forces then doing so was the best.</p><br/><p>They would all become zealous since their lives were on stake.</p><br/><p>And have their own circumstances.</p><br/><p>Just like him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn\u2026 I\u2019m not sure if I can find Suhee.\u2019</p><br/><p>Chulman grinded his teeth.</p><br/><p>He had to survive and find his daughter who he had separated from during the ticket stealing wars.</p><br/><p>His daugher Suhee and him, the two of them weren\u2019t strong enough to gather three ticket so they had to get a third random member and go up with three tickets.</p><br/><p>Since they would\u2019ve lost their tickets and died there if they had remained a bit longer.</p><br/><p>It had been a month since he had been separated with Suhee.</p><br/><p>Insecurities rose up from deep within but he couldn\u2019t do anything.</p><br/><p>He could only search fervently.</p><br/><p>Swinging the sword about crazily, the location of their goals could be seen.</p><br/><p>A clearly different place in comparison to the jungle-like environment around them.</p><br/><p>Chulman sighed a breath of relief.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like we\u2019re almost there, Old man.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chulman looked to the side towards where the voice came from.</p><br/><p>A girl who was swinging the sword diligently besides him.</p><br/><p>One of the three weakest people.</p><br/><p>\u2018Did she say she was Minhee. Hoo\u2026Suhee is just about that age too.\u2019</p><br/><p>Chulman sighed.</p><br/><p>Because thoughts of Suhee sprang up again by looking at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. But it\u2019s good because evil people don\u2019t exist here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Minhee shook her head as she spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know by looking at them from the outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Chulman grinded his teeth.</p><br/><p>It was just as she said.</p><br/><p>There might be somebody who was looking for a decisive moment.</p><br/><p>\u2018And\u2026 will it finish like this?\u2019</p><br/><p>There might not be any evil people.</p><br/><p>But when a situation changes, the people turning evil wasn\u2019t even a big deal.</p><br/><p>Chulman, who had been lost in thought, flinched as he looked at the location where they had arrived at.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026 There isn\u2019t just one door.\u2019</p><br/><p>The doors which were laid in front of them weren\u2019t just one.</p><br/><p>Exactly 10 doors for 10 people.</p><br/><p>\u2018This doesn\u2019t feel good.\u2019</p><br/><p>Chulman and the others frowned.</p><br/><p>Proofreader\u2019s note</p><br/><p>Regular chapter will come out tomorrow on Wednesday as well as on Friday and Sunday/Saturday.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

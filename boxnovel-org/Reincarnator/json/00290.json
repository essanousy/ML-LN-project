Is my beauty so incredible that it even impacts NPCs?\u2019</p><br/><p>A smirk had started to appear as she thought up to this point but she quickly resumed her original expression.</p><br/><p>Tiamet\u2019s actions weren\u2019t sincere enough for her to think this way.</p><br/><p>With an NPC with immeasurable strength, he could\u2019ve easily forced his way in but instead he just roamed around her and took care of her discreetly.</p><br/><p>\u2018How petty\u2026 Just charge at me like a man or something.\u2019</p><br/><p>This was an another world.</p><br/><p>There were cases of people dating NPCs as well.</p><br/><p>No, it was quite common actually.</p><br/><p>Since the players, who were confident in their looks, approached the NPCs for their power or wealth.</p><br/><p>And her clansmen were always joking with her as well.</p><br/><p>That she should just lure him in and catch him.</p><br/><p>Though it was still a joke in the end, there was a bit of desire for this to actually happen deep inside the clansmen\u2019s minds.</p><br/><p>Since the Kalikul clan wouldn\u2019t just remain as one of the 15 Great Clans once their relationship with Tiamet improved.</p><br/><p>There would only be a single clan to rule over all other remaining clans.</p><br/><p>That was how powerful Tiamet was.</p><br/><p>Even if he just shifted around a bit to let off his excess emotions, the entire world of Exodus would flip upside down.</p><br/><p>If Tiamet wanted to give Astania the capital then that would happen, along with the taxes that the Empire collected.</p><br/><p>A tremendous strength.</p><br/><p>And Astania had actually dreamed about this alluring future as well.</p><br/><p>Though she stopped rather quickly.</p><br/><p>\u2018That eye is the problem\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Astania smacked her lips.</p><br/><p>Eyes.</p><br/><p>The eyes of Tiamet that stared at her.</p><br/><p>Those eyes were always so sad and filled with immeasurable sorrow.</p><br/><p>And because of this, using him to gain more power and wealth didn\u2019t feel quite right to her.</p><br/><p>Astania smiled as she touched the necklace on her neck.</p><br/><p>\u2018I should treat him better once he comes back. We should eat or something. The new restaurant that opened in the front looks good.\u2019</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>The entire Kalikul clan started roaring at the broadcast.</p><br/><p>And the moment Astania heard this, she resumed her cold expression and regained her posture.</p><br/><p>Whatever was there was really important.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis bastard\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He was purposely letting out the steam after riling them all up.</p><br/><p>And as Astania smirked at the clansman who was pretending to be a reporter at a scene.</p><br/><p>\u2018What the\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Astania focused her eyes she brought the screen closer to her face.</p><br/><p>Whoooosh.</p><br/><p>Shwooosh.</p><br/><p>The countless clansmen who were on the broadcast started to disappear into golden light while only leaving behind echos of screams.</p><br/><p>\u201c...What? Why are they logging out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Astania was confused as she stared at the broadcast.</p><br/><p>Since these guys, who had no reason to log out, were disappearing into golden light.</p><br/><p>She assumed poison but it didn\u2019t seem like it.</p><br/><p>And the players who were watching the broadcast of the screen on the spaceship heard the clansmen broadcasting this backing up in shock.</p><br/><p>The players then all looked at the scene on the screen.</p><br/><p>A giant tower that reached above the clouds.</p><br/><p>And the vast city that spread out beneath it.</p><br/><p>The moment they saw this.</p><br/><p>Whooooosh.</p><br/><p>Even the broadcasting player disappeared into golden light.</p><br/><p>But Astania now knew why this was happening.</p><br/><p>The moment she saw the tower.</p><br/><p>All of her lost memories were coming back.</p><br/><p>Memories of the long forgotten past.</p><br/><p>She remembered when she had run to the city during the apocalypse.</p><br/><p>She remembered when she had been oppressed by the 1st grade citizens in the city.</p><br/><p>She remembered when she had risen up against the 1st grade citizens.</p><br/><p>And\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018Tiamet. You dumbass.\u2019</p><br/><p>Astania smiled as she remembered all this.</p><br/><p>She realized why Tiamet had taken care of her so much.</p><br/><p>And why he had always been around her.</p><br/><p>\u2018...I guess we won\u2019t be able to eat together.\u2019</p><br/><p>Whooooosh.</p><br/><p>Astania\u2019s body started to disappear.</p><br/><p>For the price of breaking the law of this world.</p><br/><p>A body which was supposed to be trapped inside the Obelisk but had instead been allowed to live in this world.</p><br/><p>A body made by someone else would disappear once it breaks their rules.</p><br/><p>And soon.</p><br/><p>Clank.</p><br/><p>Astania disappeared into golden light as only a single necklace remained beneath where Astania originally stood.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c...Ah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiiiiing.</p><br/><p>Tiamet was at a loss as he looked between the spaceship that had started to fly up in the distance and the light disappearing from the ring on this finger.</p><br/><p>\u2018How...How could this happen at the last moment.\u2019</p><br/><p>The light had gone off on the ring on his finger.</p><br/><p>The light of the ring that was connected to Astania\u2019s necklace.</p><br/><p>The light on this ring would only go off when the necklace had lost its owner.</p><br/><p>And the royal necklace wouldn\u2019t lose its owner even if one logged out.</p><br/><p>Which could only mean one thing.</p><br/><p>That the necklace had completely lost its owner.</p><br/><p>Which meant...</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha...Hahahahaha! Hahahahaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tiamet started to laugh like a maniac.</p><br/><p>The laughter which had both rage and hysteria mixed together spread out all around him and Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u2018For what\u2026 For what have I survived up until now?\u2019</p><br/><p>The moment he knew Astania died.</p><br/><p>Something that had supported him for the past thousand years had fallen.</p><br/><p>And at that moment he knew.</p><br/><p>That he had cherished this woman more than he had thought he did.</p><br/><p>\u201c...\u201d</p><br/><p>Tiamet gazed at Hansoo expressionlessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere was a lot more I wanted to talk with you about but\u2026 It doesn\u2019t matter anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>A cold smile appeared on his face.</p><br/><p>And the moment Hansoo saw this.</p><br/><p>\u2018Danger.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo instinctively crushed his heart.</p><br/><p>It was the expression of a man who had thrown away everything, someone who had nothing to lose anymore.</p><br/><p>Kwaduk.</p><br/><p>Splurt.</p><br/><p>Blood exploded out from Tiamet\u2019s mouth but the cold smile remained.</p><br/><p>He was a supernatural being even out of the supernatural beings on this world.</p><br/><p>He wouldn\u2019t die immediately even if his heart was crushed.</p><br/><p>Even if his brain was smashed his body would still move according to his final will.</p><br/><p>It would only be for a moment but it was more than enough.</p><br/><p>Enough to erase everything.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis damned world\u2026 I\u2019m going to return it all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Since it was a world created from the contract\u2026 It\u2019ll be okay for me to just return it all to how it was before.\u2019</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Kiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing!</p><br/><p>The tremendous amount of condensed energy next to Tiamet\u2019s heart started to pulsate as it quickly enlarged.</p><br/><p>The energy which he had compressed with the Rangkom\u2019s stake and the White Dragon Arena for a thousand years.</p><br/><p>This energy, which could easily flip the world upside down, started to burn up with a blinding light.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha! How useless!\u201d</p><br/><p>As Hansoo heard Tiamet\u2019s crazed laugther he quickly took Rangkom\u2019s stake from his hands.</p><br/><p>It was too late to prevent the explosion.</p><br/><p>But he had to lessen the damage as much as he could.</p><br/><p>Hansoo breathed in and out and then stabbed the stake towards the condensed energy next to where Tiamet\u2019s heart had been.</p><br/><p>!!!!!!!!!</p><br/><p>The enormous amount of energy started to get suppressed by the stake as they created an intense amount of sparks.</p><br/><p>And cracks had appeared on the sphere of energy and energy started to leak out.</p><br/><p>This energy followed the stake up into the sky.</p><br/><p>Like a bolt of lightning being attracted by a lightning rod.</p><br/><p>Kwadddduk!</p><br/><p>Hansoo quickly forced the stake to be pointed towards the sky.</p><br/><p>Rummmblee!</p><br/><p>And the energy that had started to explode out from the sphere started to follow the stake into the sky.</p><br/><p>The snowstorm got dispersed from the energy storm of the sphere and even the clouds above them started to swirl into a storm.</p><br/><p>Cough.</p><br/><p>Tiamet, who still had a bit of strength left to talk, laughed in a weak manner as he looked at the stake that had embedded him onto the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>If it was something that could be suppressed so easily like this then he would\u2019ve never said it could flip the world upside down.</p><br/><p>Though most of it flew into the sky.</p><br/><p>The remaining energy was more than enough for what he wanted to do.</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>Hansoo stomped onto the ground as he quickly rushed towards the inner parts of the Obelisk.</p><br/><p>It was not time for him to bicker.</p><br/><p>\u2018I can only live if I reduce the damage as much as I can\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>The energy he was feeling from inside Tiamet was no small matter.</p><br/><p>Hansoo, who had entered through the broken wall from before, quickly rushed in and started to drop as deep as much as he could as he broke apart the floors.</p><br/><p>Towards the deepest parts of this tower.</p><br/><p>Boom! Boom!</p><br/><p>Tiamet laughed at a loss as he heard the sounds of Hansoo breaking through the floors.</p><br/><p>\u2018Will you\u2026 Be able to succeed? In crossing that huge barrier?\u2019</p><br/><p>As Tiamet\u2019s eyes slowly closed.</p><br/><p>BOOOOOOOOOOM!!!!</p><br/><p>An immeasurable amount of energy exploded out from TIamet\u2019s body and started to sweep through everything around him.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Rumble</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? What the hell?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u2019</p><br/><p>Mudusella and the adventurers who were with the Ains were at a loss as they stared at the huge pillar of light that had appeared far behind the mountain range.</p><br/><p>A deafening sound which rang throughout the world, the earthquake that made the world tremble and blinding light that shook the entire world.</p><br/><p>If there wasn\u2019t this sky-high mountain range defending them, that huge energy storm would\u2019ve swept through them as well.</p><br/><p>As people stared at the tower of light.</p><br/><p>Mudusella saw something else.</p><br/><p>The scene of the future she had seen through the Mudusella System in the past.</p><br/><p>Though her view was blocked by the mountain range, she could clearly see it.</p><br/><p>The scene of the city in the distance.</p><br/><p>\u2018The thousand year old guardian tree...Shall fall.\u2019</p><br/><p>She saw the scene of the huge tower falling from the energy storm.</p><br/><p>Mudusella asked the adventurers at this moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou. You all received our blessings right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...Yeah. Why do you ask?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mudusella smiled coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201c...Winter is coming.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Boooooom!</p><br/><p>The tremendous snowstorm that the Obelisk had been suppressing this entire time started to sweep through the world.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

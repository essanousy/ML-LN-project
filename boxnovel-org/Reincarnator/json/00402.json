I\u2019ve had my doubts about it all this time!\u2019</p><br/><p>He\u2019d heard that the upper echelons of the Ron family were working on a new weapon.</p><br/><p>Their goal was one thing.</p><br/><p>How to allow the Dragon God Soldiers to become stronger than the aliens.</p><br/><p>When the aliens weren\u2019t here in the past, the Dragon God Soldiers were more than enough.</p><br/><p>Since the armor allowed them to achieve a strength that normal humans couldn\u2019t even imagine achieving.</p><br/><p>And things that a Dragon God Soldier couldn\u2019t deal with could just be dealt with their ships.</p><br/><p>But with the appearance of the aliens, everything had changed.</p><br/><p>Not all of them, but instead the rare few that had the strength to rival their ships.</p><br/><p>Although they and the ships had similar strengths, the difference in their effectiveness was dimensions apart.</p><br/><p>If such beings secretly invaded their territory with the goal of assassination, then it would be a nightmare.</p><br/><p>But he had been doubtful even while hearing about the research.</p><br/><p>Although he knew that they needed a change, he believed that there was a limit to how far technology could take them.</p><br/><p>Although these aliens existed, they only looked similar.</p><br/><p>They were a different race after all.</p><br/><p>\u2018Amazing.\u2019</p><br/><p>R-Kelkadian looked at his hands in shock.</p><br/><p>The tremendous power that was flooding out from inside him.</p><br/><p>It felt like the ship\u2019s engine had replaced his heart, and he had the ship\u2019s proud Bardian Cannons in lieu of his hands.</p><br/><p>The power to turn an entire city into dust, enough to massacre hundreds of thousands of people\u2014this power wiggled inside him.</p><br/><p>But R-Kelkadian soon frowned.</p><br/><p>Through the dispersing smoke.</p><br/><p>He could see the couple that didn\u2019t have a single scratch on their bodies.</p><br/><p>\u2014chiiijijik\u2014</p><br/><p>R-Kelkadian Ron smiled as he looked at Hansoo who was clad in the blue armor.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems we hit the jackpot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaa\u2026 Good.\u201d</p><br/><p>The entire Neropa Union was raking their entire territory to find these two people, and for them to appear before his eyes\u2026</p><br/><p>He would have been trembling in fear if he was still at his former state.</p><br/><p>Since the power that he\u2019d seen through the video was nothing close to what a Dragon God Soldier could handle.</p><br/><p>But not anymore.</p><br/><p>They now had a new skill, a new strength.</p><br/><p>\u2018Danger\u2026 is an opportunity.\u2019</p><br/><p>If he could deal with these two with his own hands.</p><br/><p>His position within the family would skyrocket.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo looked at the greed-filled eyes of these people and thought:</p><br/><p>\u2018Weaker than the Nerpa, but\u2026 there\u2019s quite a lot of them.\u2019</p><br/><p>They seemed much weaker than the Nerpa but there were seven of them.</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t a force that he could ignore.</p><br/><p>And it didn't seem like it would stop at seven people.</p><br/><p>And behind Hansoo and Kiriel\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease help us!

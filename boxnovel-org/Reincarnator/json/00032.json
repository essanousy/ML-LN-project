I\u2019m not sure if it was a good thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Guktae mumbled alone after the conference ended.</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s proposal was very simple.</p><br/><p>\u2018He\u2019s really a special case.\u2019</p><br/><p>Guktae actually knew that he would concede all the duties of defense and roam about alone.</p><br/><p>Since there\u2019s nobody to stop him even if he did so.</p><br/><p>It would be just that if he decided to not hunt any of the undead and hunt continuously below and only come back to cut off the Demon\u2019s head around the time everybody became a mess fighting it.</p><br/><p>Since the possibility of somebody blocking him if he told them he would take the last hit was a question in itself.</p><br/><p>Who could block him with such power and invisibility.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo didn\u2019t do such things.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026What is he thinking? What?\u2019</p><br/><p>In conclusion, it meant that he would take over the risk of the Demons by himself.</p><br/><p>If you take into account the strength of the Demons, it meant that Hansoo took on a huge burden alone even if you were to calculate for the benefit of the crystals.</p><br/><p>From his actions it seemed like he a person who grew impatient because he couldn\u2019t save someone.</p><br/><p>Though there\u2019s nothing bad about it.</p><br/><p>\u2018The demons\u2026 are peculiar.\u2019</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t enough information because only one had come out.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know if they all used similar skills or if stronger ones would come out from now on.</p><br/><p>Since the problem wasn\u2019t strength but rather their Advantages.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t seem like that they couldn\u2019t beat Hansoo if everyone in the clan charged at him.</p><br/><p>But things like that had really horrid Advantages.</p><br/><p>Like rock paper scissors.</p><br/><p>It was already hard to kill it due to the fact that it took hits very well but for it to also use area of effect magic.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that they couldn\u2019t kill it if they used skills and traits but at least a few tens of deaths would occur.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a low number even in terms of the whole and if that were to happen every time the Demons came then they might all die off.</p><br/><p>So Hansoo\u2019s of proposal of him taking over the problem with Demons was not bad.</p><br/><p>And the crystal wasn\u2019t that tempting either.</p><br/><p>\u2018That\u2019s just a trap.\u2019</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t really attractive to the Clan Lords who had to save as many as possible from their clans even if the artifacts that could be gained from collecting those were good and even if the crystal could be used in emergencies.</p><br/><p>And the reason why they wanted to get it so bad was because it would be very straining if it were to fall into the hands of others.</p><br/><p>No one knew what sort of crazy thing a Sovereign who had attained his own safety would do when things became dangerous.</p><br/><p>Since they could just escape even if the defenses fall.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s just better for nothing to get solved.\u2019</p><br/><p>Him monopolizing it all was the best option but this was impossible.</p><br/><p>The many Clan lords distribute the crystals.</p><br/><p>This was a good plan but it didn\u2019t really mean much.</p><br/><p>There won\u2019t be much profit if you think of the numbers they would lose while acquiring the crystals as well as the fact that these would make it difficult to determine each other\u2019s strength.</p><br/><p>And there were a few non-clansmen with a bit of strength.</p><br/><p>These guys won\u2019t hesitate to hit them from behind during the decisive moments of taking the crystal.</p><br/><p>Since they could just take the crystal and go up.</p><br/><p>In whichever way, it was better if both the demons and crystals didn\u2019t exist.</p><br/><p>The fact that Hansoo would take everything didn\u2019t differ much from the rule which said the drops from a monster which somebody killed goes to that person.</p><br/><p>\u2018Though it gets on my nerve that one person gets all the crystals\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>He also looked over the catalogue.</p><br/><p>Incredibly menacing artifacts were lined up.</p><br/><p>If he had to choose between these things going into the clan lord\u2019s hands or Hansoo\u2019s hands then he would choose the latter.</p><br/><p>\u2018Isn\u2019t it crazy. Such a thing\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>An object that you could buy with 15 crystals.</p><br/><p>All of your allies within 300 meters had all of their stats increased by 15% even if you were just holding it.</p><br/><p>And if you beat the drum, the effects were even more glorious.</p><br/><p>One beat to increase the regeneration speed of those who heard it, two beats decreased the perception by 15% but increased strength and agility by 25% and three beats even increased resistances.</p><br/><p>You couldn\u2019t use it for 5 days once you beat it three times but even the thought of another clan other than his having this was frightening.</p><br/><p>And no matter how he looked at it, the worth of this thing was not merely 15 crystals.</p><br/><p>The only reason he could think of as to why it had been listed as 15 crystals was one.</p><br/><p>It was a price that seemed like could be gained if the clan lords hit and killed each other and fought.</p><br/><p>If it was an absurd price such as 100 then he might\u2019ve given up but 15 was pretty doable.</p><br/><p>And it seemed like every object on the catalog was like this.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know if it was intentional but all the group use objects were much more formidable than self use objects.</p><br/><p>As if it was promoting them to hit and receive hits from each other en masse.</p><br/><p>\u2018Wicked bastards.\u2019</p><br/><p>Guktae clicked his tongue as he thought of the fairies.</p><br/><p>Then Sunghoon, one of the clansmen, standing next to him asked.</p><br/><p>A person who had gotten the position of a personal guard because he was his friend and most trusted person.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen shall we give up making the special force?\u201d</p><br/><p>Guktae shook his head at those words.</p><br/><p>There was no rule saying that the special forces had to be used against Demons only.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease keep preparing them. And\u2026 there probably is somebody who has known Hansoo since the first tutorial. Please find them no matter what and gain some intel. Whatever you can get.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sunghoon wholeheartedly nodded his heavy expression at those words.</p><br/><p>And Guktae threw another sentence at that Sunghoon:</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd please go down there and find as many people with special psychic powers.\u201d</p><br/><p>2000 people.</p><br/><p>If you search then they would exist.</p><br/><p>Psychic powers that were good against Invisibility.</p><br/><p>No, not just invisibility.</p><br/><p>He had chosen people based on how good they were against other humans because he had thought power was the most important thing.</p><br/><p>This was a miscalculation.</p><br/><p>Everything from that Demon to that guy called Hansoo.</p><br/><p>Their opponents were not mere humans and problems that would be hard to solve with people who could swing their swords well will continue to come up from now on.</p><br/><p>In order to prepare for all sorts of situations, he needed people with vastly different skills and psychic powers.</p><br/><p>He had to prepare thoroughly from now on.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s ok as long as I do it properly from now on.\u2019</p><br/><p>He had met a tiger after looking at deers until now.</p><br/><p>Which meant he just had to prepare a way to deal with the tiger.</p><br/><p>Since when did humans fight against tigers barehanded.</p><br/><p>\u2018Still\u2026 it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019ll be hard to leave this island at this rate?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo would take care of demons as others dealt with the undead in turns.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t want to acknowledge it but the rules were set up without much commotion thanks to Hansoo.</p><br/><p>Casualties would constantly occur but a lot of people could survive at this pace.</p><br/><p>\u2018But I should still prepare.\u2019</p><br/><p>There was no need to think of the tiger as a friend even if it is helping you.</p><br/><p>Guktae started to prepare as he thought of Hansoo who could be anywhere.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWow\u2026 It seems like a lot more of us would survive than I thought?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems so\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone gazed at Hansoo who was fighting fiercely with the Demon in the distance.</p><br/><p>At first there was a bit of a resistance when Hansoo said he would monopolize the crystals but after a while it was clear that it wasn\u2019t a bad choice.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yeah. It\u2019s already hard for us to have a look at crystals\u2026 It\u2019s better for that guy to grapple around with Demons and for us to all ascend together alive.\u2019</p><br/><p>20th day of the defense at this moment.</p><br/><p>The amount of people alive was a huge number of 1300.</p><br/><p>600 had died but if they had gone up against the demon, and if the crystals were set loose, then the number of the people alive and dead would be reversed.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo, who had cut off the Demon\u2019s neck, shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026.Now the hidden piece will activate.\u2019</p><br/><p>Defensive Battle.</p><br/><p>It really didn\u2019t suit his personality.</p><br/><p>But despite that, he had been focusing on the defense whilst jumping around back and forth and killing off demons constantly.</p><br/><p>He was managing with his best ability in order to gain crystals to arm himself and to set up the rules so no internal fights occurred.</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t even taken a step towards the Demon Lord\u2019s Castle because he was also taking care of those who were trying to aim for his back.</p><br/><p>Since as long as the hidden piece didn\u2019t activate, there was no point in going to the Demon Lord\u2019s Castle.</p><br/><p>Hansoo mumbled inwardly.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m not sure if you guys coming back would have been better instead\u2019</p><br/><p>He had seen and learned from watching Keldian and Eres but he could only imitate them and do as well as them.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo shook his head.</p><br/><p>If it was something that could be solved with one strong sovereign then there was no reason for humanity to have gone extinct.</p><br/><p>He had come back in order to do things that Eres couldn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>\u2018Keeping more than 50% of the people alive by 20th day. I succeeded Eres. But didn\u2019t I win this? I saved even more.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo had a broad grin.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t unify them as well as Eres but had reduced the damage from the Demons as much as possible so he saved even more.</p><br/><p>And when this happened, the fairy, who couldn\u2019t watch the peacefulness of the people, appeared and the hidden piece got activated.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s here.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cHello! Everybody! It\u2019s already the 20th day! The people here have really defended well! Normally there\u2019s only around 500 alive by now.\u201d</p><br/><p>At these words the people made expressions full of pride as they still grinded their teeth.</p><br/><p>Since it felt like they fucked the fairy up from the fact that they dodged the hidden motives of the fairy and had defended in such an excellent way.</p><br/><p>\u2018If it stays like this\u2026then we can ascend without many problems\u2019</p><br/><p>But the fairy grinned as it looked at those people.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut what do we do. It gets really bad from now on. Everyone, do you even know how to get out of this island?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone mumbled about at those words.</p><br/><p>How could they know such a thing?</p><br/><p>The fairy laughed as it spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery simple. After a month, a portal will open from the crystal you guys had been defending. You guys can ascend higher through that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut there is a very slight problem. That crystal has a limit. Only 500 people can leave through that crystal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat to do? Too many survived. Usually I don\u2019t even need to come out\u2026 since occasions where more than 500 people surviving don\u2019t happen often.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s expressions started to gain an edge.</p><br/><p>The current survivors were 1300.</p><br/><p>And if they defend in this spirit then at least 1000 could live.</p><br/><p>However, the amount that could leave was 500.</p><br/><p>But then the fairy grinned whilst watching these people.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry too much. There\u2019s a place with a much larger crystal! There\u2019s more than enough for all of you to escape through in that place!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026where is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>As someone asked, the fairy grinned as it pointed to the Demon Lord\u2019s Castle which could be seen from afar.</p><br/><p>\u201cOver there. It normally doesn\u2019t work but\u2026 I\u2019ll start it up now. Heehee\u201d</p><br/><p>Hooooong.</p><br/><p>At those words, a grand noise started to resonate from one location within the Demon Lord\u2019s Castle and everyone who heard it grinded their teeth.</p><br/><p>And at the same time the people started to split up.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo also had a cold expression.</p><br/><p>\u2018It starts.\u2019</p><br/><p>Actually, this was more of a surprise event if you looked at it differently.</p><br/><p>It was a hidden piece that didn\u2019t happen unless the requirement of more than 50% living by the 20th day has been accomplished.</p><br/><p>Since if it was below that, the numbers would reduce to below 500 whilst defending.</p><br/><p>Would Eres have gone to the Demon Lord\u2019s castle because she wanted to?</p><br/><p>Eres didn\u2019t know what would come out when he went there back then.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know what he would gain but it was obvious that more people than if theyf were defending would die.</p><br/><p>In a situation where Eres wanted as many people to live by combining their strengths, there was no reason for him to go.</p><br/><p>But there was only one reason which made Eres head towards the Demon Lord\u2019s Castle in such a situation.</p><br/><p>It was all due to this damnable hidden piece.</p><br/><p>Eres had defended too well.</p><br/><p>And ironically too many people had survived.</p><br/><p>While other teams couldn\u2019t even keep 200 alive out of 2000 on average, Eres had kept over 1000 people alive before the 20th day arrived.</p><br/><p>It was the result of firmly rejecting the mini-crystals and combining the people\u2019s strengths.</p><br/><p>Actually it wasn\u2019t only Eres who had activated this Hidden piece.</p><br/><p>There was a few times when people who had gained amazing traits and skills had fought well against the demons and forcefully united the remaining people in order to keep more than 1000 people alive has existed.</p><br/><p>And the people standing in front of the hidden piece had to make a decision.</p><br/><p>To head towards the Demon Lord\u2019s Castle despite the dangers.</p><br/><p>Or defend and defend\u2026 and have a huge battle royale in order to choose the 500 in the end.</p><br/><p>And after collecting all the intel from the Final Brigade, there was nobody he knew who had chosen the first option other than Eres.</p><br/><p>It was obvious, since at least 500 could survive even if they didn\u2019t go.</p><br/><p>And if the 500 people who could live said that they won\u2019t go, the remaining people won\u2019t be able to go anyway.</p><br/><p>Since they won\u2019t have enough power.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t going. It\u2019s better to focus on defending.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have a reason to go either. Instead of everyone dying by going, let\u2019s save 500.\u201d</p><br/><p>The forces split up and grouped up with Clan Lords as the center.</p><br/><p>\u2018He had taken these people huh.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo started to admire Eres.</p><br/><p>And thought.</p><br/><p>That he would never be able to become like Eres in his life.</p><br/><p>Hansoo walked forward as he warmed up his body.</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s Note</p><br/><p>Guys please understand that as I have three tests this week, It\u2019ll be hard for me to pump chapters out. I\u2019ve already pulled an all nighter on saturday night x.x. Please also understand that while each chapter may take only around 10 to 15 minutes to read, it takes hours for it to complete [despite the bad english].</p><br/><p>KobatoChan\u2019s Note</p><br/><p>So now, the Reincarnator\u2019s \u201cnormal\u201d releases will be about 3 to 4 chapters a week.</p><br/><p>Please do throw some money and whip Ekdud!</p><br/><p>1 $ = 1 whip</p><br/><p>Oh and the two other chapters for today will come a little bit later</p><br/>\n</div>"}

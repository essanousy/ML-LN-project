One team can account for 2 protectors a day.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone turned towards him at these words.</p><br/><p>\u2018Those guys are\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>All 50 of them weren\u2019t that simple.</p><br/><p>But these guys were eye- catching even with just a glance.</p><br/><p>One of the two most dangerous households.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026A clan. And only 10?\u2019</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that they walked around with the words of \u2018Clan\u2019 written on their foreheads but there was a huge difference in the actions between clansmen and non-clansmen.</p><br/><p>Because non-clansmen would constantly be stealing glances at each other while clansmen are only looking out.</p><br/><p>The unique thing about these guys though was the fact that they only had a very small amount.</p><br/><p>\u2018Only ten\u2026.\u2019</p><br/><p>A miserable size compared to other clans.</p><br/><p>It was reasonable for them to not go to the second floor right away and start at the 1st floor and even participate in the treasure hunt with such size.</p><br/><p>Though no one could understand why they only had 10.</p><br/><p>\u2018They\u2019re still dangerous.\u2019</p><br/><p>Suhan mumbled inwardly.</p><br/><p>Since there is a clear difference between clansmen and non-clansmen even if their numbers are the same.</p><br/><p>At that moment another voice was heard from the corner.</p><br/><p>\u201cI agree. 10 people will take care of 2 a day. This seems like the right choice. If you aren\u2019t able to follow then compensate for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the other two teams that caught the eyes.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t look like the clans here but something else caught the eyes.</p><br/><p>They were all holding a precious-looking artifact.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026Did they kill off the rest in a 30 man room and come up.\u2019</p><br/><p>Their aura alone was mighty.</p><br/><p>Whatever happened, as the 20 people who looked like the strongest of the 50 agreed, the others fussed around as they nodded their heads.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t like following those people\u2019s orders but the fact that they would all die if they did not find the Treasure was right.</p><br/><p>They needed to think about it after they find it.</p><br/><p>Since the fight will be from that point on.</p><br/><p>If they conflict with each other and don\u2019t find the treasure then it\u2019ll just simply be a massacre.</p><br/><p>About 10 people got into teams and then disappeared in multiple directions.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo also watched the people dispersing and then walked towards the dungeon of the Protector.</p><br/><p>\u2018I will accomplish the hidden piece first.\u2019</p><br/><p>The hidden piece he had as the goal was .</p><br/><p>The requirements were very simple.</p><br/><p>There were marbles behind the protector.</p><br/><p>128 in total since there were 128 of them.</p><br/><p>Only one of the marbles was a shining marble and the ones who didn\u2019t shine were normal marbles.</p><br/><p>If you collect 32 of them then they will trade it for the Philosopher\u2019s stone.</p><br/><p>Kangtae had accomplished this in the past.</p><br/><p>Something he had gotten while collecting them just in case.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s easier to be alone in order to accomplish it in a short amount of time\u2019</p><br/><p>Though it was easy when said, the difficulty of the dungeon of the Protectors wasn\u2019t that easy.</p><br/><p>He will only be able to collect 32 if he releases the transformation and use his true body to progress quickly.</p><br/><p>Hansoo quickly threw his body towards one of the dungeons of the protectors.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The people who had accomplished the dungeon made a tired expression as they heard the noise resonating throughout the island.</p><br/><p>People cursed out loud.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this. They don\u2019t give out anything\u2026. despite it being so hard\u201d</p><br/><p>There were quite a bit of beasts on the way.</p><br/><p>They had given quite a bit of runes and artifacts for the 10 people to share.</p><br/><p>As if they were telling them to hunt them instead of going to the dungeons of the protectors.</p><br/><p>But then they won\u2019t be able to finish the 2 dungeons the team needed to accomplish a day.</p><br/><p>And that was the reason why everyone proceeded towards the dungeon even while they were smacking their lips.</p><br/><p>They had some expectations actually.</p><br/><p>So many runes and artifacts were dropped but the dungeon of the Protector was said to be even harder.</p><br/><p>It was obvious that they expected an even greater amount of rewards.</p><br/><p>But the result was only a huge amount of disappointment.</p><br/><p>They had broken through the dungeon after a long time but the amount of dropped runes and artifacts were minimal.</p><br/><p>And they so were hard that it was hard for them to accomplish two a day if they wanted to do it without taking any injuries.</p><br/><p>If this was the case then they could only focus on killing the dungeons of the protectors.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamm\u2026 but there\u2019s nothing we can do. We all die if we don\u2019t find the treasure.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah true\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>If they were unlucky then the treasure will come out when they hunt the 128th protector.</p><br/><p>If they aren\u2019t able to find the treasure while leisuring about then they won\u2019t even be able to get the reward.</p><br/><p>They would just all die.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>While they were complaining and spitting words out one at a time, one of the people walking in the front turned around and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan I say something?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone looked at the person standing in the front.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, to introduce myself simply I am called Chulman. But the name isn\u2019t important\u2026 there\u2019s just something I want to tell you.\u201d</p><br/><p>As everyone\u2019s eyes focused, Chulman opened his mouth:</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s think. Even if we were to find this treasure could we take this to the altar safely? And is there a meaning even if we were to take it there?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone made a skeptical expression.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t speak out but they knew.</p><br/><p>They were confident in themselves but two teams out of the five, who had gone a different way, were at a different level.</p><br/><p>If they were to move about in teams of 10 and find the treasure and those guys decide to take them away forcibly then they would only get it stolen from them.</p><br/><p>And the few hundreds meters of the area around the altar were barren so it wasn\u2019t even possible to sneak up there.</p><br/><p>And as the fairy spoke before, the news of the treasure being found will be spread all around .</p><br/><p>Even if they wanted to exchange the treasure for rewards, they will only get suppressed by the people who would rush their way there.</p><br/><p>Since they needed to go to the altar where the fairy is in order to exchange the treasure for the reward.</p><br/><p>Or, they might have everything stolen even if they got there safely and exchanged the treasure for the rewards.</p><br/><p>There was no rule saying that every artifact had to be distributed evenly even if they chose to exchange for 50 of them.</p><br/><p>If they steal it all then nothing is left in their hands.</p><br/><p>Chulman spoke out as he looked at the people mumbling about.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you all understand? This is a tactic that can only be accomplished if we work together but if we stay like this as the weaker ones then we may all just die. Though it\u2019s important to find the treasure, we must take into account of the aftermath after finding the treasure.\u201d</p><br/><p>They needed to go through three stages in order to survive in this place.</p><br/><p>Obtain the treasure.</p><br/><p>Get the treasure to the altar and exchange it for the reward.</p><br/><p>Take the reward and walk out.</p><br/><p>The requirements were already set.</p><br/><p>If your battle strength is weak then you would lose your head even before you got to the altar where the fairy was.</p><br/><p>And even if you were able to get to the Altar safely, you won\u2019t be able to choose the number of the reward.</p><br/><p>Since people would be charging at them in order to take the limited rewards from all around.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no way that those guys will let them go since they will just die if they don\u2019t acquire those.</p><br/><p>In order for the people with low battle powers to survive, they needed to exchange it for 50 of Kurutan\u2019s Bludgeon to fit the number of people and spread it all around.</p><br/><p>\u2018No\u2026 you can still die with that if you are unlucky.\u2019</p><br/><p>Since there was no guarantee that each person will get one of the 50 Kurutan\u2019s Bludgeons.</p><br/><p>If you are weak then you might just die from the acts of evil people.</p><br/><p>Since they can steal it for fun and go out with it.</p><br/><p>But if your battle power is sufficient?</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t even a need to look for the treasure.</p><br/><p>\u2018Since they can just steal it from the guys who come to the altar in the center after finding it.\u2019</p><br/><p>The aftermath of them finding the treasure was more important for them to survive.</p><br/><p>Chulman raised his spirits as he saw the people get shaken and continued to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course everyone needs to combine their strengths in order to find the treasure. But does everyone need to try to hard to find the treasure? It\u2019s hard for us to get through two dungeons in a day but the teams we saw earlier can even clear 4 in a day. Though casualties may increase.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone nodded.</p><br/><p>Since those people were at a different level from them.</p><br/><p>It was possible for them to clear four in a day if they hurried.</p><br/><p>Though casualties will happen one by one.</p><br/><p>Chulman nodded as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose guys will clear the protector\u2019s dungeons much faster than us. What do you think those guys will do after they accomplish their quota?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course they will\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone expressions turned solemn.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t have any leisure but those strong guys had to leisure to even hunt.</p><br/><p>Their gaps will increase even more.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t the time for us to search fervently. We just need to pray that one of the two strongest households don\u2019t find it fast. Since only then would they hurry and search for the treasure by sacrificing bits of their strengths at a time. And during that time, we must get stronger. In order to prepare for the aftermath of them finding the treasure.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were weak.</p><br/><p>It would just become even more dangerous for them if they find the treasure like this.</p><br/><p>But if they were to do the following then the distance in the gap will become shorter which means that they will be able to ensure their own safety to some point even after they find the treasure.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026 isn\u2019t there a possibility for them to chase us down and vent their anger on us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Though the island was wide, they could still find each other if they set their minds to it.</p><br/><p>Though they won\u2019t meet each other while they fight, if there isn\u2019t any announcements of dungeons being cleared then they will come and find them.</p><br/><p>Chulman shook his head as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow would they know who did and who didn\u2019t when there\u2019s five teams.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone nodded.</p><br/><p>If they lie and act normally then they would be able to get through it.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd by the time they find out and come to us, we\u2019ll have become quite formidable as well. If we clash then they also would get injuries and won\u2019t be able to clear the dungeons of the protectors, would they be able to fight us in such a situation?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s expressions turned cold.</p><br/><p>Correct.</p><br/><p>It was not time for them to let their guards down.</p><br/><p>The aftermath of finding the treasure was more important than actually finding it.</p><br/><p>If they have weak battle powers then they won\u2019t be able to escape their fate of their game being stolen after their hunt.</p><br/><p>The point was that it didn\u2019t matter who tried harder.</p><br/><p>It was who is stronger.</p><br/><p>The people who had heard Chulman\u2019s words nodded with a frozen expression and then changed their direction towards the hunting grounds from the direction to the dungeon.</p><br/><p>Chulman also clenched his teeth as he advanced forward.</p><br/><p>\u2018I must survive in order to find Suhee.\u2019</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t let his life be in the hands of the strong.</p><br/><p>There will be no point of shouting about for fairness when you didn\u2019t have the strength to even ensure your own rights.</p><br/><p>Chulman slowly walked forward with clenched teeth.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>Kudududuk</p><br/><p>\u201cHooh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo stretched his body as he looked at the back of the protector that he had smashed.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s more convenient to move about alone as I thought\u2019.</p><br/><p>His battle power will decrease if he were to act with others because he won\u2019t be able to release his transformation.</p><br/><p>The fairy\u2019s voice resonated all around as Hansoo touched the marble he had attained after killing the protector.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s a blank as I expected.\u2019</p><br/><p>A marble which did not give off light.</p><br/><p>But this was actually more important for Hansoo than the actual treasure.</p><br/><p>As Hansoo touched it, it got absorbed like a rune into his left wrist and turned into a symbol.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s the fourth one.\u2019</p><br/><p>If this pace was to continue then collecting 32 in 2 weeks wouldn\u2019t be hard.</p><br/><p>Since he will be able to get through about four in a day if he didn\u2019t go overboard.</p><br/><p>But on the other hand, it was hard for him to do more than four.</p><br/><p>Since going overboard meant that the strength he had remaining to use the next day will decrease.</p><br/><p>They might really not be able to find the treasure if the other\u2019s don\u2019t crush through the dungeons well.</p><br/><p>\u2018Then it\u2019ll be a massacre\u2019.</p><br/><p>One day had passed.</p><br/><p>Logically speaking 14 fireworks should\u2019ve been made combined with his since they had decided that they will do two per five teams for 10.</p><br/><p>But the actual number was only 10.</p><br/><p>Which meant that somebody didn\u2019t accomplish their quota.</p><br/><p>And the time between each firework was getting longer and longer.</p><br/><p>Which meant that they were getting lazier.</p><br/><p>They are definitely being lazier and have more leisure since 10 was being filled up without them hunting for themselves.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hmm\u2026 these actions are obvious.\u2019</p><br/><p>This place would be very easy to clear as 50 people of a clan but getting massacred wasn\u2019t that hard when 50 different people with different thoughts and strengths gathered.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s time for me to move.\u2019</p><br/><p>Solving the situation in this place was actually quite simple.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t matter whether there was an underling of the Dark Lord\u2019s or not.</p><br/><p>He just needed to turn into his real self and crush them all.</p><br/><p>He was more specialized in catching people than beasts anyway.</p><br/><p>The beasts could take quite a hit but the people here will puke out blood just from the dagger he threw, because of their limited health.</p><br/><p>There was no way for the people here to beat him who had the Seven Stripe Cape and the Dekrados Set.</p><br/><p>Then he would tell them to kill the protectors of their quota.</p><br/><p>Then he just needed to take the treasure to the altar, from whoever found it, and that\u2019ll be the end of it.</p><br/><p>\u2018But\u2026 then the earring is a little bit regrettable.\u2019</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t transformed to kill off a few tadpoles.</p><br/><p>And there was no problem even if he didn\u2019t release his transformation.</p><br/><p>Since he had already found someone to act on his behalf a long time ago.</p><br/><p>Hansoo disappeared after activating Arankal\u2019s Bracelet.</p><br/><p>Proofreader\u2019s note</p><br/><p>This is the last regular chapter of the week. With the two upcoming sponsored chapters, there\u2019ll be a chapter on Monday and Tuesday as well the regular chapters on Wednesday, Friday and Sunday. Many thanks to the sponsors!</p><br/><p>Some clarifications: The Protectors are inside their own dungeon. Arankal\u2019s Bracelet is the item Hansoo got in Central Island\u2019s underground dungeon. It makes him invisible, but is difficult to use with strenuous movements (like in battle).</p><br/>\n</div>"}

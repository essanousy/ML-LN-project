There\u2019s nothing to see.\u201d</p><br/><p>The players started to leave one by one after a long period of curiously staring at the mysterious letters.</p><br/><p>This damned thing didn\u2019t have an entrance anywhere.</p><br/><p>Even if it did, they would have to melt all the ice surrounding this thing at this rate.</p><br/><p>Which was not possible.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go up!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh. What a waste of time.\u201d</p><br/><p>The players complained but started to climb up one by one with weights lifted off their minds.</p><br/><p>They still gained something from this.</p><br/><p>\u2018Even if the guys from the Empire are crazy they wouldn\u2019t fault us when we have come this far.\u2019</p><br/><p>If they really wanted to go through it then they probably could by gathering every player here including the ones above.</p><br/><p>But why did they need to?</p><br/><p>This was more than enough.</p><br/><p>They had even given up their hunts to come all the way north to find this guy, what can they do about him escaping into some mysterious piece of metal?</p><br/><p>\u2018There. Nothing we can do.\u2019</p><br/><p>As they came up from the hole, they could see countless others having climbed out from the snow and were checking their gear.</p><br/><p>And one of the players who came out from the hole shouted towards them.</p><br/><p>\u201cYo! Let\u2019s go! It\u2019s a dud.\u201d</p><br/><p>But nobody moved.</p><br/><p>\u2018What? Do they not trust me?\u2019</p><br/><p>Well, his words did lack some explanation.</p><br/><p>But as the player was about to shout again.</p><br/><p>One of his clansmen spoke with a frown on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201c...We can\u2019t man.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>The clansman showed the player the message that had come.</p><br/><p>Though there were a lot of words in it, the summary was simple.</p><br/><p>And the player frowned as he saw the message.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damned Empire...Stressing me even inside the game. What the hell is the 4th Brigade anyway.\u2019</p><br/><p>According to what he knew, there was only 3 Brigades in the Empire.</p><br/><p>The player shouted while frowning at the news of the Brigade he had never heard of.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about it! If they just started then it\u2019ll take forever for them to get here. How long are we supposed to wait!\u201d</p><br/><p>These players had taken two days despite running at full speed to get here.</p><br/><p>Of course it would take longer if one calculated the time it took to kill beasts on the way.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Whooosh.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019re here already.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...Huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>His vision darkened for a second and then the shadow below his feet stood up.</p><br/><p>\u2018What the\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>The player was shocked at the sight of his own shadow getting up and moving around.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>The shadow turned into a man.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hmm\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>A powerful aura that radiated from his entire body.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know what the 4th Brigade was but this was more than enough to tell him that they weren\u2019t simple.</p><br/><p>And there was another problem.</p><br/><p>\u2018What is that.\u2019</p><br/><p>A small shield in the man\u2019s right hand.</p><br/><p>As the players made fearful expressions at the shield that let out a suspicious but powerful aura.</p><br/><p>The man who had used the spirit and his own skills to travel thousands of kilometers at a tremendous speed, Jang Oh, spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the situation?\u201d</p><br/><p>A few of the players were irritated at the arrogant NPC but it was still a NPC from the Empire.</p><br/><p>They explained the situation.</p><br/><p>Which made Jang Oh shocked.</p><br/><p>\u2018...There\u2019s energy flowing? Wasn\u2019t it a ruin?\u2019</p><br/><p>The place he obtained the Spirit wasn\u2019t as strong as this.</p><br/><p>Since they barely maintained their existence deep inside the ice or in the middle of a swamp somewhere.</p><br/><p>\u2018I guess it\u2019s a bit different\u2019</p><br/><p>But this didn\u2019t matter.</p><br/><p>Since all he needed to do was accomplish his objective.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is the end of jumping around.\u2019</p><br/><p>Jang oh muttered to himself as he jumped into the hole Hansoo had made.</p><br/><p>With the shield raised.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Whooosh!</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked around as he fell.</p><br/><p>A vast space.</p><br/><p>A lake and a forest.</p><br/><p>The lake was so clear and blue that it seemed like fishes would jump up at any moment and the green color of the forest made it look extremely healthy.</p><br/><p>And the best part was the sky he was falling through.</p><br/><p>Ooooong.</p><br/><p>A giant object was floating in the air and lighting up this entire space.</p><br/><p>Bright but warm.</p><br/><p>Like...</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s like a sun. A miniature sun?\u2019</p><br/><p>It seemed like it contained a tremendous amount of energy but seeing it was radiating very soft light he could only think of the sun.</p><br/><p>And something else came into his eyes as he fell more.</p><br/><p>If everything he had seen so far was beauty of nature then this was something quite opposite.</p><br/><p>Cylindrical buildings that rose high into the sky.</p><br/><p>Oooong.</p><br/><p>Hansoo used a bit of mana to intensify his vision.</p><br/><p>He then saw the identity of these buildings.</p><br/><p>Starting at the outer parts, and at the inside through the windows.</p><br/><p>And a conclusion quickly came.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s a residential building.\u2019</p><br/><p>Though there were a lot of strange objects, there were basic living conditions set such as tables, seats, beds and others.</p><br/><p>It was a building created for residents.</p><br/><p>And looking at this giant cylinder, a thought came up in Hansoo\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u2018Colony.\u2019</p><br/><p>A colony created for survival which one could see in Sci-Fi movies.</p><br/><p>Tatatatak.</p><br/><p>Hansoo landed onto the trees in an area which seemed to have been created as a orchard.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Why is such a thing below the Northern Tundra?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo made a confused expression.</p><br/><p>Even Jang Oh, who had gained the powers of the Spirit, didn\u2019t tell him about this.</p><br/><p>\u2018Did he not tell me...Or was it different from this.\u2019</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know when and why this was created but he knew one thing for clear.</p><br/><p>That there were Spirits here.</p><br/><p>Shrrrng.</p><br/><p>Hansoo touched the branches of the tree next to him.</p><br/><p>Then a joyous and familiar aura seeped out.</p><br/><p>An aura full of life and vigor unlike the destructive auras of the Spirit Stones.</p><br/><p>\u2018Aura of the Tree Spirit.\u2019</p><br/><p>A type of Spirit Stone which was sold much cheaper than ice or fire types because of its lack of usage in battles.</p><br/><p>But it was doing its job perfectly here.</p><br/><p>Maintaining the best state for the trees that were living here.</p><br/><p>\u2018The Lake\u2026 And the Land as well.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo started to walk as he sensed the nearby auras of the lake and the land below his feet.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t have time to waste.</p><br/><p>There was one objective he had right now.</p><br/><p>Getting the Spirit and going across the mountain.</p><br/><p>And for this, he had to move.</p><br/><p>Hansoo pondered for a moment and then picked a direction.</p><br/><p>\u2018To the Power Room.\u2019</p><br/><p>Though this place was being managed by a Spirit, the Spirit did not live here.</p><br/><p>To be exact, the energy of the spirit was keeping every corner of this place alive.</p><br/><p>This place which was isolated from light, air and water from the outside.</p><br/><p>\u2018And also check on the way. See whether there are living creatures here\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>It was made for living creatures.</p><br/><p>It was a low probability but there might be traces of living things.</p><br/><p>There might even be somebody who had the answer to the question of what Mudusella wanted him to bring.</p><br/><p>Tatatatak!</p><br/><p>Hansoo started to head towards the central area with the buildings while following the aura of the Spirits below his feet.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Shhshshshhhh.</p><br/><p>The surrounding trees that were being protected by the Spirit started to tremble.</p><br/><p>As if they were communicating.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Tatatatatak.</p><br/><p>After a bit, he got to a giant structure after passing through many others.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s here huh.\u2019</p><br/><p>A giant structure of which the entire outside was reinforced by a metal spirit.</p><br/><p>He could feel a tremendous amount of energy and vigor from inside it.</p><br/><p>\u2018There must be something in here.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded.</p><br/><p>Even if something was inside there, it didn\u2019t matter.</p><br/><p>Since he just needed to get the Spirit\u2019s power and go across the mountain.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Rummblee.</p><br/><p>A rumbling noise was heard from where he had come in from.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo nodded at this sound.</p><br/><p>\u2018He came fast.\u2019</p><br/><p>Though Tiamet couldn\u2019t come, there was no way he would just sit and watch.</p><br/><p>And Clementine\u2019s forces wouldn\u2019t sit around either.</p><br/><p>Hansoo thought of the man who had come to meet him.</p><br/><p>\u2018...I didn\u2019t want to meet you like this but I guess I\u2019ll have to turn a blind eye this time around right?\u2019</p><br/><p>His previous mentor.</p><br/><p>At the same time his protector.</p><br/><p>And his friend.</p><br/><p>Hansoo composed himself as he saw Jang Oh who was creating a hole through the wall he had come through far off in the distance.</p><br/><p>While gripping the Forked Lightning tightly.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn. Are you seeing this right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s live right now. Is it like the hint for the next big update? Damn, I\u2019m jealous of these guys.\u201d</p><br/><p>A rumor filled with curiosity circulated between the players outside the War Fortress.</p><br/><p>Usually a live broadcast would only be used in battles as a tactical usage but that wasn\u2019t the case this time.</p><br/><p>The players have envious expressions as they saw the live broadcasts of the players who were looking at this entire thing all the way up at the Northern Wall.</p><br/><p>They were jealous because the rewards the first party that succeeded after the 5th update came and the Maze had opened were quite substancial.</p><br/><p>Rummmblee!</p><br/><p>\u201cWoah\u2026.What the. Is that a NPC? Jesus christ.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p><br/><p> Rumble!</p><br/><p>The people started to mumble in shock from the NPC who was smashing a hole into the alloy wall with a tiny shield in his hand.</p><br/><p>Usually they would be attracted at the sight of a powerful NPC but their eyes turned to something else.</p><br/><p>Not the NPC but rather the alloy wall he was creating a hole in.</p><br/><p>Specifically the things that would be inside.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Chiiijijijik!</p><br/><p>The moment the NPC male created a hole with this powerful attacks.</p><br/><p>The players who were watching cheered.</p><br/><p>\u201cWoah! Is he going in!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn...Shall I go over there as well?\u2019</p><br/><p>Due to the yells of the nearby players, the others who had been encircling the War Fortress started to turn on the broadcast one by one.</p><br/><p>Soon.</p><br/><p>The entire surroundings of the War Fortress were filled with tiny floating screens.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

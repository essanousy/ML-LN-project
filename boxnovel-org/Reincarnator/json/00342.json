He didn\u2019t want to embarrass himself in front of such a beauty.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. Since such an advanced civilization was working this hard to dig it out, shouldn\u2019t it be amazing?\u201d</p><br/><p>He wasn't basing his confidence just on this assumption. </p><br/><p>The original inhabitants of this so-called \u2018excavation center\u2019 had actually left behind a record.</p><br/><p>A record stating that if one can excavate the hidden weapon below this base, , then they would have a chance to save their actual planet.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yeah.\u2019</p><br/><p>Samuel smiled confidently.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know why these two were heading towards the research center, but only an insane maniac would approach that place because it had the tightest defenses of any structure in this entire floor.</p><br/><p>Which meant that they had a specific goal to achieve.</p><br/><p>The other transcendents had acted like that as well.</p><br/><p>Transcendents could not be born without desire.</p><br/><p>Samuel knew that these people would help them out.</p><br/><p>\u2018You guys need slaves as well, so we will gladly fill that role.\u2019</p><br/><p>He\u2019d never even dreamed of being able to control these two.</p><br/><p>Their levels of strength were dimensions apart.</p><br/><p>He only wished for one thing.</p><br/><p>And that was for these guys to take them in.</p><br/><p>He could guarantee that their group was quite useful.</p><br/><p>Since strength wasn\u2019t the only thing that one needed to survive in this world.</p><br/><p>So he had called out to these two.</p><br/><p>To give them what they\u2019d been searching for and gaining protection in return.</p><br/><p>And these two weren\u2019t dangerous, at least according to Jack, so it was fine for now.</p><br/><p>Escaping this damned shelter was the most important thing.</p><br/><p>The robots were getting closer and closer to finding them, and being stuck in this underground shelter was becoming increasingly unbearable.</p><br/><p>It would be nice to monopolize the unknown weapon hidden below, but Samuel wasn\u2019t confident enough in the weapon for him to go all out against those robots.</p><br/><p>They needed a shield.</p><br/><p>Like the ones they had in the past.</p><br/><p>Before Melchizedek betrayed them.</p><br/><p>\u2018It was nice when they protected us\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>As Samuel grit his teeth at the thought of those transcendents who\u2019d left them behind and gone up\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014Hansoo organized his thoughts and asked a question.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre there perhaps any abyssal beings living in the tunnels?\u201d</p><br/><p>And Samuel smirked inwardly at this question.</p><br/><p>He clearly knew why Hansoo was asking such a question.</p><br/><p>\u2018Even a powerful person like him is trying to avoid fighting, huh?\u2019</p><br/><p>Well, it would be weird if he was actively looking for a fight.</p><br/><p>Why would they bother fighting if they could actually retrieve that weapon?</p><br/><p>Samuel continued to explain.</p><br/><p>It hurt his pride, but he needed to make themselves look good.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. We are doing our best to keep ourselves hidden. Almost two hundred people are sustaining the barrier, and we\u2019re even using artifacts to reinforce it. How could the abyssal beings find us when even Melchizedek cannot?\u201d</p><br/><p>They had always been meticulous about staying hidden in case of the scouting machines.</p><br/><p>All so they could dig out that precious weapon buried below.</p><br/><p>\u2018And if they can help us\u2026 it would be faster.\u2019</p><br/><p>Although they\u2019d been digging at a good pace until now, they had started to encounter the harder, rocky layers, and could only dig out a few dozen meters in a day.</p><br/><p>But if these two could help them out, it would only take an instant to finish.</p><br/><p>Samuel smiled as he thought of the mutual benefits for both parties.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo seemed to have lost interest as he said:</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re leaving.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiriel nodded, a bored expression already on her face, and Samuel was left flustered at what had just happened.</p><br/><p>\u2018Huh?...Why?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2014rummmblee\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2018Annoying.\u2019</p><br/><p>Kiriel looked at the small group of males following her and Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you coming with us?\u201d</p><br/><p>And Jack, who\u2019d been leading the group next to Kiriel, nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, we plan to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t expecting us to protect you, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jack shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no. We\u2019ll manage our own work ourselves. I\u2019m sure we can be of help.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jack looked back at the shelter that he\u2019d once placed so much hope on. It was now far behind them.</p><br/><p>In the past, he had once thought of that shelter as their final ray of hope.</p><br/><p>He knew that as long as they could dig out whatever was below it, they would gain the chance to get back at the metal cans.</p><br/><p>But not anymore.</p><br/><p>\u2018From their reactions\u2026 there\u2019s a chance that the thing hidden below won\u2019t be as amazing as we expected.\u2019</p><br/><p>Jack thought to himself as he looked at the duo.</p><br/><p>Those two people were moving around as if they already knew a lot about this place.</p><br/><p>And he had lost all interest after hearing their words.</p><br/><p>The thing hidden below might be something his group would find amazing.</p><br/><p>But it seemed like it wouldn\u2019t be for these two transcendents.</p><br/><p>Logically speaking, shouldn\u2019t they stick with the stronger side then?</p><br/><p>Samuel couldn't bear to give up the shelter, and so he had stayed behind. But Jack couldn\u2019t let this opportunity go.</p><br/><p>But at least he\u2019d stayed loyal.</p><br/><p>When Jack had been about to leave, Samuel had said:</p><br/><p>If he had voiced out his thoughts on the way out, there would be many more following the two of them.</p><br/><p>At least half of them would.</p><br/><p>Of course, he never planned to say anything, even without Samuel\u2019s plea.</p><br/><p>Since it wouldn\u2019t be good for him either if more competitors came along.</p><br/><p>\u2018I cannot let this woman go.\u2019</p><br/><p>Jack stared at Kiriel.</p><br/><p>It was a chance of a lifetime.</p><br/><p>Blinding beauty and earth-shaking strength.</p><br/><p>If such a powerful and beautiful woman were to protect him?</p><br/><p>The probability of him surviving in the future would become much higher.</p><br/><p>And it wouldn\u2019t be a bad choice for the woman as well.</p><br/><p>It was a bit too much for him to say with his own mouth, but he was one heck of a hunk.</p><br/><p>He had almost never failed at getting a girl in the past.</p><br/><p>His face was more than enough, but his trait, which allowed him to read a woman\u2019s emotions, was basically made to bewitch women.</p><br/><p>Kiriel shrugged at Jack and looked to Hansoo.</p><br/><p>As if she was asking Hansoo if this was fine.</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked at Jack and said:</p><br/><p>\u201cGo back. It\u2019s not too late.\u201d</p><br/><p>But Jack shook his head.</p><br/><p>He could not let this chance go, and he knew a small fact about the robots.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can protect ourselves. Just leave us behind if we become a nuisance, we aren\u2019t that selfish.\u201d</p><br/><p>He wasn't sticking around for no reason.</p><br/><p>The artificial robots naturally aimed for stronger beings.</p><br/><p>Which meant that this was safer for them.</p><br/><p>While the two of them distracted the robots, their group could just fight the weaker ones or stay hidden.</p><br/><p>He just needed to hold on until he established a good relationship with that woman.</p><br/><p>\u2018Trust me\u2026 I won\u2019t be in any danger.\u2019</p><br/><p>But something came into Jack\u2019s eyes, and he laughed to himself.</p><br/><p>\u2018...What is that?\u2019</p><br/><p>Jack frowned at Hansoo, who was opening and closing his hands.</p><br/><p>It seemed like Hansoo was measuring something.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

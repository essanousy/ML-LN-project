If you see somewhere that\u2019s broken and earth is exposed, stab it with your sword. Oh and be careful of your hand when you stab.\u201d</p><br/><p>Right below the granite was soil, confirming that this place just copied the looks of Gangnam Train Station.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 How do you know all of this?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Taesoon asked with a suspicious look, Hansoo replied very simply.</p><br/><p>\u201cPsychic powers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At those words the seven who had been eyeing Hansoo with a terrified face carefully walked on the granite as they stabbed the areas with exposed soil.</p><br/><p>Kiiieeeeek!</p><br/><p>Hansoo shook his head at the way they stabbed the earth ruthlessly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Four of them are useful. Three aren\u2019t quite there yet.\u2019</p><br/><p>Surprisingly the females were leading.</p><br/><p>Mihee and Jisun were stabbing the earth with clenched teeth and Taesoon and Jisun\u2019s boyfriend were also stabbing the earth zealously.</p><br/><p>But the remaining three were perhaps afraid of the green worms who came out screaming, they were just watching quietly from the back.</p><br/><p>Hansoo didn\u2019t really care about those three.</p><br/><p>There was no reason to get upset because they didn\u2019t join in on the fight. Because the work will eventually fall onto him anyway.</p><br/><p>Soon there were tiny runes shining everywhere.</p><br/><p>Hansoo was picking the runes that came out from his killings then turned around and asked with a weird look:</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Why aren\u2019t you picking them up?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then Taesoon laughed awkwardly.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, It\u2019s nothing much but\u2026 isn\u2019t it better for you to take them all? Even in games we do something where we give everything to one person.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone nodded a little bit.</p><br/><p>Just because you eat runes it didn\u2019t mean you would become strong like superman.</p><br/><p>But if at that instant, if they were to get caught by those beastly things and get tetanus or something then they would just die.</p><br/><p>If they give all these runes to Hansoo and his protection is safer, it\u2019s a better option.</p><br/><p>Hansoo shook his head at those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe things you kill, you take.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was not his thoughts.</p><br/><p>If they were going to become enemies from the start it wouldn\u2019t really matter but if they are going to travel together they at least needed some rules.</p><br/><p>And this was the most basic rule that they followed in order to stay together for decades when roaming around the abyss.</p><br/><p>\u2018As I expected due to it being the start\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Thinking that they will protect you because they eat the runes is a very flawed idea.</p><br/><p>Why would they since we\u2019re friends. Thoughts like if i\u2019m this nice to them they will reward me with something.</p><br/><p>When a situation where one\u2019s life is on the line comes along, a relationship built on each other\u2019s likes disappear like bubbles.</p><br/><p>So far reality is still in check but soon after they will realize it.</p><br/><p>A situation where one\u2019s life is in danger isn\u2019t far off in this place.</p><br/><p>In conclusion the only thing you can trust is your own ability.</p><br/><p>If you are useless you will get thrown off immediately.</p><br/><p>They will realize it eventually and once they do they will zealously go for runes and become red eyed.</p><br/><p>The above rule was created because of that.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m not their babysitter, they\u2019ve got to handle things themselves.\u2019</p><br/><p>At that moment Taesoon mumbled softly in the corner.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey look over here. There\u2019s a special rune here.\u201d</p><br/><p>At those words everyone gathered around.</p><br/><p>Everyone saw it for the first time but from instinct they knew what use this rune had.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf one takes this then they can use skills huh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Taesoon mumbled as he stole glances at Hansoo.</p><br/><p>The object gives rise to the desire.</p><br/><p>Before, Hansoo coolly said that they should distribute the runes but if his eyes turn at the sight of these new runes and he says that he will take it, Taesoon had no way of stopping him.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan I really take this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then Hansoo nodded his head.</p><br/><p>Hansoo even knew the identity of that rune.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s a pretty good rune at the start\u2019</p><br/><p>A rune that made your skin hard and increased regeneration.</p><br/><p>A rune which holds both defense and regeneration in the beginning where survival is important.</p><br/><p>And that rune was almost like a passive where learning had no restrictions and didn\u2019t take mana.</p><br/><p>You get more gluttonous but for the benefit you get, it\u2019s worth it.</p><br/><p>Food can be stolen once you get stronger and won\u2019t be a problem.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u2018I cannot learn skills freely.\u2019</p><br/><p>Usually one learned a few tens of skills.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not erasable but there isn\u2019t really anything you need to give up to learn the skill.</p><br/><p>The strength of the skill changes according to proficiency and rank but since there\u2019s no risk of learning there\u2019s no harm in learning it.</p><br/><p>Someone with a good sense and a lot of mana sometimes has over a hundred and Keldian had over a thousand.</p><br/><p>And since he was able to use all those skills properly he was one of the strongest four.</p><br/><p>Kangtae was the strongest but if they actually fought Keldian was not a joke either.</p><br/><p>But he could not be like that.</p><br/><p>A nickname given by Eres after seeing his peculiar characteristic.</p><br/><p>A characteristic that allowed him to catch up to Kangtae, Keldian, Eres and stand shoulder to shoulder with them despite starting 20 years late.</p><br/><p>And the characteristic that was the deciding factor that made the others send him to the past instead of themselves.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The time he realized his characteristics was when he first learned a skill.</p><br/><p>The first skill he learned was </p><br/><p>But as soon as the rune was implemented to his body he knew he made a mistake which could not be changed.</p><br/><p>&lt;\u2026the amount of skills I can learn is exactly seven.&gt;</p><br/><p>To be specific the amount of runes that was allowed for him was seven.</p><br/><p>Eres always lamented.</p><br/><p>The limit of seven was a huge disadvantage.</p><br/><p>But more so than that there\u2019s a huge advantage to it.</p><br/><p>The speed at which the proficiency of the skill rises is surprisingly fast.</p><br/><p>At an incredible speed.</p><br/><p>And the skill even breaks the limit and keeps on evolving afterwards.</p><br/><p>The skill he learned, Dororo Lizard\u2019s Essence which basically just gave fast regeneration evolved to the point where it was comparable to his immortal technique he learned.</p><br/><p>Eventually the Dororo Lizard\u2019s Essence was like that.</p><br/><p>The scrubby skills which he learned as a final resort in order to survive eventually strengthened as he struggled.</p><br/><p> upgraded to the point of Keldian\u2019s Void Ripper and upgraded to the point where it got as strong as Blood Magic.</p><br/><p>In the abyss where a strong skill was important, this was a talent of blessing.</p><br/><p>And for that Eres firmly told him before he came back to the fast.</p><br/><p>Make sure to carefully select before deciding on the seven skills.</p><br/><p>And he was thinking of doing that if all went according to his plans.</p><br/><p>\u2018According to my plans\u2026 there\u2019s nothing before exiting the tutorial area.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m going to learn it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The surrounding friends stared jealously at Taesoon who was very happy.</p><br/><p>And soon when Taesoon absorbed the rune a change occurred.</p><br/><p>Wriggle</p><br/><p>Taesoon\u2019s skin temporarily showed a bit of green then returned.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t much change but Taesoon knew the second he learned what kind of change happened to his body.</p><br/><p>The tired body started to have miniscule amounts of vitality flowing into it and the skin which had been grazed by the teeth of the green worm started to heal.</p><br/><p>And a newly appeared stat.</p><br/><p>\u2018A stat called physical resistance appeared\u2019</p><br/><p>Taesoon touched his ears.</p><br/><p>[Park Taesoon]</p><br/><p>Strength: 11.1</p><br/><p>Agility: 10.1</p><br/><p>Stamina: 12.5(+1.5)</p><br/><p>perception:10.3</p><br/><p>Physical Resistance: 10.7(+0.7)</p><br/><p>-Ekrol Troll Tribe\u2019s Essence (Proficiency 1.0%)</p><br/><p>\u2018Good\u2019</p><br/><p>The proficiency was only at 1% but quite a lot of stats went up</p><br/><p>Dumbass, giving me something like this.</p><br/><p>If it was him he would never have given it.</p><br/><p>Hierarchy should be used when one has it.</p><br/><p>\u2018I will catch up to you\u2019</p><br/><p>Taesoon, who had counted the number of runes, watched Hansoo with a confident smile.</p><br/><p>While Taesoon was doing that Hansoo checked his stats.</p><br/><p>[Kang Hansoo]</p><br/><p>Strength: 15.3</p><br/><p>Agility: 12.1</p><br/><p>Stamina: 12.1</p><br/><p>Perception:13.2</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s not bad\u2019</p><br/><p>The level where it was not bad but rather it was extremely fast-paced compared to the past.</p><br/><p>Hansoo shook his head as he continued forward.</p><br/><p>But at that moment Taesoon came next to Hansoo as he spoke:</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be dangerous from now on so let\u2019s go together.\u201d</p><br/><p>And as Hansoo saw Taesoon steal a glance at Mihee he shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026there\u2019s no way that he\u2019s seeing me as a competitor.\u2019</p><br/><p>Actually this much was cute.</p><br/><p>In the future one won\u2019t know how it will change.</p><br/><p>\u2018Whatever happens it isn\u2019t bad.\u2019</p><br/><p>Even if they split the runes the speed was fast so the rate at which the runes increased was faster compared to when he hunted alone.</p><br/><p>He was worried that he might be in the way but he was at least working enough for one person.</p><br/><p>With the two as the lead, the eight kept on going forwards.</p><br/><p>Thankfully a little bit of light came through half broken down roofs so there wasn\u2019t much issue in going forward.</p><br/><p>Though it was a little hard to see.</p><br/><p>Kuaduduk</p><br/><p>Maybe it was because they got greedy after seeing a skill since everyone was greedily slashing down upon green worms but they could still not compare to Taesoon and Hansoo\u2019s speed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Anyways\u2026 that guy doesn\u2019t even have a skill but he\u2019s so much faster than me.\u2019</p><br/><p>Taesoon looked at Hansoo with a slightly jealous look.</p><br/><p>Due to the new skill he could dash in with a little less fear.</p><br/><p>That was the reason why his hunting speed rose.</p><br/><p>But that guy ruthlessly dove between green worms as if he was invincible and slashed down on heads.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026No. I will win.\u2019</p><br/><p>Taesoon, who could not accept that a guy who was quietly stuck in a corner was much better than him, was slashing down on green worms even more zealously than before as he advanced slowly.</p><br/><p>Mihee cautiously trailed behind and asked Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026but why are we going downwards?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo replied to those words:</p><br/><p>\u201cTo ride the subway.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026The subway?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Taesoon looked at the collapsing train station with no electricity, he looked at Hansoo with suspicion.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

This rat of a bastard\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>Five days.</p><br/><p>He had searched around this area, looking for Hansoo, for five days.</p><br/><p>He wouldn\u2019t have been this mad if there weren\u2019t any traces in the first place.</p><br/><p>But the most annoying thing was that there were very faint traces of him left behind.</p><br/><p>Sometimes a faint scent could be smelled and sometimes the traces of the Forgotten Sword he had stolen from Gyesoo were left behind.</p><br/><p>This made him even madder.</p><br/><p>Since he was just tailing his back even if he was chasing with all his might.</p><br/><p>\u2018Goddamnit\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>It would\u2019ve been easier if he had brought some of his subordinates here but he had come here for a vacation.</p><br/><p>But then he\u2019d rather commit suicide than receive Ailen\u2019s help.</p><br/><p>Since he\u2019d lose face.</p><br/><p>Then Gyesoo spoke cautiously towards Kalz Morenn.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about\u2026 catching Camille Rowe?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCamille Rowe?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kalz Morenn slightly frowned as he heard this.</p><br/><p>This was something that Gyesoo had been suggesting for a while.</p><br/><p>Since Hansoo\u2019s main goal was the Calamity Fish, he would naturally be dragged in if you catch his comrade.</p><br/><p>But there was a reason why Kalz Morenn had not done this yet.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damnit. Not being able to catch a single newcomer is enough face lost but for me to take people hostage?\u2019</p><br/><p>If Amil Stadan, from one of the Six Pillars , heard this then he will laugh at him while holding onto his stomach.</p><br/><p>No, he would become a public object of ridicule to the clans of the twelve roots.</p><br/><p>But his rage was currently exceeding his pride.</p><br/><p>There were instances in his plan where he would not be able to catch a guy for 5 days.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well if I take care of things well\u2026. There won\u2019t be rumors.\u2019</p><br/><p>Kalz Morenn asked Gyesoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do you want to do it? You told me you couldn\u2019t use your trait yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gyesoo laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHansoo might erase his tracks but why would she. She would not think that someone will be chasing her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHooh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince we almost finished the sightseeing preparation, we\u2019ll separate to find her and then send a Blue Carrier Pigeon once we do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kalz Morenn made a satisfied expression as he nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou be careful. You are the main actor of the 2nd part of the tour. Remember why I take care of you so well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I know very well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys find Camille according to your plans. I shall continue searching for Hansoo.\u201d</p><br/><p>If he gave up like this then his pride would be damaged.</p><br/><p>Camille was a last resort.</p><br/><p>\u2018I will catch him before that.\u2019</p><br/><p>Gyesoo nodded as he saw Kalz Morenn grind his teeth and send Blue Carrier Pigeons in every direction.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cHooh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked at his food jar container.</p><br/><p>A container that was full of the Nutritional Fluid and the Kukulja heart extract.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ve almost collected all of the materials for the Hardening Fluid too.\u2019</p><br/><p>Since he had some time left until Camille would finish gathering all the materials, he had gathered a few extra materials that he would use on the boat.</p><br/><p>As he saw flames exploding from place to place, it seemed like that Kalz Morenn had been enraged to no extent.</p><br/><p>\u2018It is pretty annoying.\u2019</p><br/><p>But it seemed like that Kalz Morenn wasn\u2019t that talented despite being the captain of the shock troopers.</p><br/><p>If Kalz had raised his chaser skill then it would have been harder to hide his tracks.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s have a peek.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo adjusted the shape of the formless energy of the Forgotten Sword so that light would be diffracted.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that hard. He just needed to change the thickness a little bit.</p><br/><p>He then proceeded to apply mud onto his face as he started to look over the cruise ship in the distance along with his transformed sword that acted like monoculars.</p><br/><p>He knew of the cruise ship\u2019s location due to the heat that had come off during the Gertas incident.</p><br/><p>In order to not get caught within their eyes he had to stay this far back to look over them discreetly.</p><br/><p>Hansoo frowned after looking over the location of where the Blue Carrier Pigeons were flying and Kalz Morenn\u2019s movements.</p><br/><p>\u2018Look at these guys. They changed the target.\u2019</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t think that Kalz would\u2019ve done such a thing due to his pride of being the captain of the shocktroopers of Lighthouse but it seems that his rage had overcome his pride.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s move.\u2019</p><br/><p>He had collected all the materials anyway.</p><br/><p>The time had come for him to reunite with Camille.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s see\u2026 she would be around the Erum Mines or Kukuru burrows by now.\u2019</p><br/><p>A dumb person wouldn\u2019t know but Camille was rather smart so she would choose the most efficient route.</p><br/><p>Which meant that she had to be in one of these two.</p><br/><p>\u2018I have to find Camille before them.\u2019</p><br/><p>Otherwise it\u2019ll become troublesome.</p><br/><p>\u2018First I\u2019ll go to Kukuru burrows.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo carefully got out of his seat and quickly headed off somewhere.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Kaaaaaak!</p><br/><p>Camille madly slashed her short spear towards the Erums running towards her.</p><br/><p>Hoooong.</p><br/><p>The short spear endlessly slashed through the air.</p><br/><p>The respiratory holes of the Erums, who had the shape of a beetle, were sliced apart as they dropped down.</p><br/><p>Kwadududk.</p><br/><p>Camille split the stomach of the Erum, took out the secreting gland and then squeezed the liquid into a small bottle.</p><br/><p>\u2018I collected it all.\u2019</p><br/><p>Camille cracked the joints on her body.</p><br/><p>She had collected all of 14 ingredients out of the 17 ingredients Hansoo had asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018My progress is faster than I expected, it seems like I\u2019ll finish in about a day.\u2019</p><br/><p>Camille started to head out of the mine after looking at the bottle of liquid.</p><br/><p>But at the same time she could feel somebody coming into the mine with her acute battle senses.</p><br/><p>Camille tensed up and focused.</p><br/><p>Erum Mines were quite difficult for newcomers.</p><br/><p>Which meant that whoever came here was not a newcomer.</p><br/><p>But she sighed as she recognized the footsteps and breath and climbed up.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here. Why are you here already though? I haven\u2019t collected it all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo shrugged at Camille\u2019s words and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe situation changed a little. Some annoying guys seem to have gotten on our tail.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnnoying guys?\u201d</p><br/><p>Camille made a confused expression.</p><br/><p>If this guy, who didn\u2019t recognize how high the sky was, thought of somebody as annoying then that person would be far beyond that.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKalz Morenn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What did you just say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKalz Morenn. He seems to be the captain of the shock troopers of Lighthouse.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell have you done while you\u2019ve been away from me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Camille shouted with a flustered expression.</p><br/><p>She was a third year too but Kalz Morenn was at a different level.</p><br/><p>If she fought him then she\u2019d just melt down without being able to do anything.</p><br/><p>\u2018No, why is such a guy on the End Root?\u2019</p><br/><p>But there was only one important fact.</p><br/><p>That those guys will chase them.</p><br/><p>Camille made an expression full of despair and then spoke towards Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s start up the boat. There\u2019s no time.\u201d</p><br/><p>She hadn\u2019t gathered all the ingredients but if they waited here and then encountered Kalz Morenn then they would both die.</p><br/><p>No matter how strong this guy was he could not go against Kalz Morenn.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you gather all the materials?\u201d</p><br/><p>Camille shook her head at Hansoo\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot the Kukuru Scales, Mixblood Fairy Breath and Arantal Lights.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo started to pull some things out of his pockets after hearing Camille\u2019s words and spoke:</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Kukuru Scales. I\u2019ve gotten it on the way here. Focus on getting the other two for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What are you going to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked at Camille and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to buy some time while you gather the materials.\u201d</p><br/><p>Not a single material could be left out.</p><br/><p>Since an unstable Hardening Liquid will be made.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s meet at this location after you gather the materials. I will bring the boat there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo then told her the place they would meet up at.</p><br/><p>Camille looked at Hansoo with a worried expression and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it better to collect the materials quickly with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo shook his head at these words.</p><br/><p>He had seen it on the way here.</p><br/><p>The net had been closed up much more than he had anticipated.</p><br/><p>At this rate they would be caught by the time they gather the materials and get to the boat.</p><br/><p>One person had to buy some time.</p><br/><p>\u2018There\u2019s no need to lead the others astray.\u2019</p><br/><p>He just needed to get Kalz Morenn distracted.</p><br/><p>Since Camille could handle the rest.</p><br/><p>Hansoo then thought of Kalz Morenn.</p><br/><p>He had left traces around wide open spaces on purpose while running away.</p><br/><p>Very faintly.</p><br/><p>Only so that one could find them if they had a chaser skill.</p><br/><p>He had left olfactory traces sometimes and other times he left temperature related traces or footsteps.</p><br/><p>And he saw Kalz Morenn chasing him from afar with the transformed sword and then checked his reaction.</p><br/><p>The result was clear.</p><br/><p>\u2018The chaser skill he had learned\u2026 is a type of scent chaser.\u2019</p><br/><p>That guy was chasing his direction with the changes of scent.</p><br/><p>Hansoo thought up to this point as he ripped a piece of his clothing off, ripped it to shreds and smeared blood onto it.</p><br/><p>He then held onto it tight with his hands as he spoke to Camille.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave it to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo ended with those words as he quickly started to run towards the jungle and Camille looked at Hansoo with a complicated expression but then also ran off to gather the materials.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026Mmm?\u2019</p><br/><p>Kalz Morenn frowned at Hansoo\u2019s scent which had suddenly gotten stronger.</p><br/><p>\u2018He had hidden so well up to this point, why is this?\u2019</p><br/><p>Kalz Morenn deducted the reason after a brief thought.</p><br/><p>The answer had come out.</p><br/><p>\u2018He has been watching me.\u2019</p><br/><p>The reason why Hansoo had shown himself was clear.</p><br/><p>Since it was after they started chasing after Camille Rowe.</p><br/><p>\u2018If I knew that he would come out like this then I would\u2019ve done this sooner.\u2019</p><br/><p>Kalz Morenn didn\u2019t actually have a lot of expectations against that Camille girl.</p><br/><p>Since he hadn\u2019t thought that Hansoo was a person who would jump out because of one hostage.</p><br/><p>He had told Gyesoo to do this because he was so fed up but for such a thing to happen.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ll gladly kill you.\u2019</p><br/><p>Kalz Morenn laughed maniacally as he chased the traces.</p><br/><p>The traces were very clear unlike the ones so far.</p><br/><p>He had thought that these were traces to lure him in but such a thing could be clearly seen.</p><br/><p>All his senses and the skill were telling him clearly.</p><br/><p>That Hansoo had just gotten past this area.</p><br/><p>Kalz Morenn made a cold expression after chasing these traces for a long time.</p><br/><p>\u2018If he set up a trap then\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo might not even be at the end of this chase since he was much more formidable than he had expected.</p><br/><p>If that happened then he was really going to find that Camille and rip her to shreds.</p><br/><p>Hansoo might be different but she can\u2019t run away from him.</p><br/><p>It would be quite a nice target to vent his anger on since it seemed like Hansoo valued her greatly to come out like this.</p><br/><p>\u2018I should tell the guys to find Camille first.\u2019</p><br/><p>Kalz Morenn flinched momentarily while he was just about to send a Blue Carrier Pigeon to tell them to keep chasing Camille\u2019s traces.</p><br/><p>And then he changed the message of the Pigeon as he saw somebody standing in the distance.</p><br/><p>Kalz Morenn walked towards Hansoo who was standing with a leisurely expression by the Kukulja Lake after sending the Blue Carrier Pigeons.</p><br/><p>\u201cI really wanted to meet you. Friend. I would\u2019ve been really disappointed if I wasn\u2019t able to meet you this time along.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo chuckled towards that Kalz Morenn.</p><br/><p>\u201cI could only help you since you could not find me after all that. I even left hints.\u201d</p><br/><p>Though the hints had not been left behind to help him but saying this was enough to stimulate him.</p><br/><p>And as expected, veins appeared on Kalz Morenn\u2019s forehead as soon as he heard Hansoo\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Because everything from having to run after a one single newbie to worrying to get disturbed for the sightseeing and faking a hostage wielding replayed in his memory.</p><br/><p>\u2018This fucking son of a bitch\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>But soon after, Kalz Moreen took a deep breath in and out.</p><br/><p>This guy was a fish that was a already caught.</p><br/><p>\u2018Even if you have a boat that you left somewhere\u2026 I won\u2019t allow you to get over there.\u2019</p><br/><p>As long as one comes into his sight, they can\u2019t escape by running.</p><br/><p>He just needed to catch him and slowly smash him apart.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou brat. Let\u2019s see if you can still say that while you\u2019re getting burnt.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Kalz Morenn approached him with flames surrounding his body, Hansoo threw the Ghweche seeds in his pocket onto the lake as he ran away on the lake.</p><br/><p>And then he sliced his thigh.</p><br/><p>Then blood started to pour out as it spread out in the Kukulja Lake.</p><br/><p>Pududadadak.</p><br/><p>The Kukuljas were madly rushing towards him since he had covered the sword again.</p><br/><p>Kalz Morenn flinched at this and then mocked him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you trying to do? Are you trying to hold on over there?\u201d</p><br/><p>Others might be different but he wasn\u2019t scared away from going towards the lake from the fear of getting bit by Kukuljas.</p><br/><p>He just needed to burn them all.</p><br/><p>Kalz Morenn stopped atop the Kukulja\u2019s bodies as he madly started to run atop on the lake.</p><br/><p>Everytime Kalz Morenn stepped on the Kululja\u2019s head, their skulls were crushed like tofu.</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked at Kalz Morenn and then laughed.</p><br/><p>Of course he couldn\u2019t lead him astray and then get to the boat on top of the water.</p><br/><p>That guy was clearly much stronger than him.</p><br/><p>Since he was on a different level from Gyesoo or the other Quadratus guys.</p><br/><p>But there was no need to go atop of the water.</p><br/><p>The breeding lake was something that the Kukuljas, who originally lived on the sea, had dug out.</p><br/><p>The underground passage here is connected to the sea.</p><br/><p>Hansoo finished his thoughts and then looked at the artifact on Kalz Morenn\u2019s neck rapaciously.</p><br/><p>\u2018If he has something like that then he would definitely follow me right?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cKeep my item safe.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo smiled at Kalz Morenn, who had the survival-type artifact that was extremely hard to acquire, as he jumped down towards the lake where the Kukuljas were swarming in.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis crazy bastard\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Kalz Morenn grinded his teeth as he saw this.</p><br/><p>Proofreader\u2019s note</p><br/><p>Regular chapter 1/3.</p><br/><p>It seems maximum effort is put into breaking Ekdud!

We won!\u201d</p><br/><p>The people who had arrived at the villages yelled in glee.</p><br/><p>The Satellite Fortresses that were falling in the distance.</p><br/><p>There was nothing else that proved their victory better than this.</p><br/><p>\u2018I wondered what the hell it was\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Kulkin, a Hunter of the village, thought of the words spoken by those who had entered the village along with him and made a dumbfounded expression.</p><br/><p>They were now truly free.</p><br/><p>Since if those damned Satellite Fortresses didn\u2019t exist then sweeping away the Higher Races and gaining back their hope wouldn\u2019t be a dream anymore.</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>Boom! Boom!</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026.?\u2019</p><br/><p>Kulkin and the other villagers looked towards the woods from the huge noises coming in from the depths of the forest.</p><br/><p>And soon.</p><br/><p>Shhhhh.</p><br/><p>Around ten Higher Race members walked out from the woods.</p><br/><p>The ones who had set up a formation and were pushing the giant metal wolf back before.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026The Akalachia, Arukons and the Rebeloongs are together?\u2019</p><br/><p>While Kulkin was frowning from this strange scene.</p><br/><p>Somebody cursed out loud from next to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou ballsy bastards! Where the hell do you think this is!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThose guys aren\u2019t unkillable anymore! We can do it if we group up!\u201d</p><br/><p>The villagers reacted the moment they saw the Higher Races.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Whooosh!</p><br/><p>Hundreds of rage filled projectiles few towards the Higher Race.</p><br/><p>But in an instant.</p><br/><p>Trtrtrtrnggg</p><br/><p>The golden spear in the Akalachia\u2019s hand spun around like a windmill.</p><br/><p>And the Rebeloongs and the Arukons behind also used their spears to deflect away the projectiles.</p><br/><p>Tong! Titititing!</p><br/><p>Hundreds of projectiles got destroyed and bounced off in mid air.</p><br/><p>And everyone flinched as they saw this scene.</p><br/><p>They had made too many assumptions.</p><br/><p>Thinking about it again, those guys still had tremendous amounts of bodily strength.</p><br/><p>Maybe if they had mana but in a situation like this where they also lost their skills, they weren\u2019t easy opponents at all.</p><br/><p>While the people stopped.</p><br/><p>From the mouth of the Akalachia in the very front, unexpected words came out.</p><br/><p>\u201cCalm down. Anyways, who are you guys? Are you our descendants? Why are you living in a cave like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>For them to not know whom they have toyed around for so long.</p><br/><p>The people stared at the Akalachia just in case it was some trick but the curiosity and confusion inside the eyes of the Akalachia didn\u2019t seem like lies.</p><br/><p>\u2018What the hell\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>The villagers fell into a confused state.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018How long has past? What happened?\u2019</p><br/><p>The general and royalty, Kel-Durin mumbled as he looked at his body and his surroundings.</p><br/><p>\u2018It seems like we\u2019ve succeeded\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Kel-Durin stared at the tiny race in front of his eyes.</p><br/><p>Of course if he still had his original body, that man over where would be a bit larger than himself.</p><br/><p>But since the transfer has been completed, the man looked way too small compared to himself.</p><br/><p>\u2018What is this guy. He doesn\u2019t seem like someone from our race.\u2019</p><br/><p>Kel-Durin felt the tremendous amount of power within his body and then made a confused expression as he watched the person in front of his eyes.</p><br/><p>Though they looked similar, there was a lot of fundamental differences such as the bone structure.</p><br/><p>And also he didn\u2019t have the mana pool that every Sage had in general.</p><br/><p>\u2018It seems something unexpected happened.\u2019</p><br/><p>Kel-Durin frowned as he looked at the broken containers.</p><br/><p>Ssssk.</p><br/><p>Kel-Durin then checked the machinery where the Blue-Stone was embedded in.</p><br/><p>A transmitter that was built to migrate hundreds of thousands of souls at the same time for the move.</p><br/><p>And as if it had used up all its power, the lights from various panels on it were getting faint but Kel-Durin was able to check the panels before they turned off.</p><br/><p>He then exclaimed out in shock.</p><br/><p>\u2018790 years? 790 years have past?\u2019</p><br/><p>Something went wrong and that something went wrong horribly.</p><br/><p>As Kel-Durin was frowning.</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>Boobooom!</p><br/><p>The Akalachias who were fighting up above came down to the secret room</p><br/><p>And soon the secret room was filled with tens of giant Akalachias.</p><br/><p>Though they had met each other again in completely different bodies, Kel-Durin was able to figure who was who out instantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cKel-Durin\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKan-Kun, well done.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kel-Durin frowned as he looked at Kan-Kun who was covered from head to toe in blood.</p><br/><p>It seems they only activated the Red-Stone and fought each other.</p><br/><p>Kan-Kun frowned at the pain and then asked the race standing on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you? And why do you have that in your hands?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Black-Stone and Red-Stone were items left behind for the small amount of managers to activate.</p><br/><p>It was not something that this guy, whom he had never even seen or heard of, should have.</p><br/><p>Kiiiiiing.</p><br/><p>\u2018And it\u2019s still active huh.\u2019</p><br/><p>Kan-Kun frowned as he sensed the dry mana within his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cHand that over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Whooosh</p><br/><p>Kan-Kun crouched and then moved his hand towards the small midget.</p><br/><p>The Red-Stone alone was fine but the Black-Stone that had combined with the Red-Stone was dangerous to them as well.</p><br/><p>It was a tremendous artifact that suppressed their entire technology with just its existence.</p><br/><p>They wouldn\u2019t even have made such a thing if they didn\u2019t have to for the move.</p><br/><p>Though the plan seemed to have shifted a little but since the first stage, Soul Migration, has been completed they needed to get it back.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo lifted his spear with his hand.</p><br/><p>Clang!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou see, stealing is a bad habit.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know how they were going to act.</p><br/><p>He could not hand it over in such a case.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s originally ours you midget.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kan-Kun spoke with a growl.</p><br/><p>He was feeling pain and he didn\u2019t understand the situation yet.</p><br/><p>He was already annoyed but somebody who he has never seen before was pointing a blade at him while holding onto a dangerous weapon.</p><br/><p>Of course a rough growl came out of Kan-Kun\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>He would\u2019ve tried to save his body without mana in the past but everything was different now.</p><br/><p>Since they had gained a new body along with new strength.</p><br/><p>Courage that could support his rage rose up inside him.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo spoke to these Sages.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to have a go?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>At those words the Akalachia standing in the very front ,Kan-Kun the rank 1 Sage, scoffed.</p><br/><p>Though the little midget\u2019s body seemed quite strong, it was not even close to theirs.</p><br/><p>What was causing him to be so arrogant?</p><br/><p>Well, it wasn\u2019t that the Sages didn\u2019t like conversing.</p><br/><p>But there was no need to do things the hard way then their strength was much higher than the other party.</p><br/><p>\u2018Suppress him and then take it.\u2019</p><br/><p>Boom! Boom!</p><br/><p>The rank 1 Sages inside the Akalachia\u2019s body walked towards Hansoo.</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>Kkkkkkkkkngggg</p><br/><p>A vibration that shook the entire room could be felt.</p><br/><p>Something much different than their footsteps.</p><br/><p>And Kan-Kun and Kel-Durin flinched at this quake.</p><br/><p>\u2018What\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>This was the vibration from the Monolith that shook the secret room moving.</p><br/><p>And soon a loud shout was heard in the distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Are you alright in there! We\u2019re coming in!\u201d</p><br/><p>At the same time with that shout, countless people coming in could be felt.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026There\u2019s this many? What the hell happened while we were asleep\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>An earthquake that was transmitted through the long tunnel.</p><br/><p>The Sages, who have obtained this new body that could sense this quake, frowned in nervousness.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of changes in the 800 years we were asleep huh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kel-Durin, the person in Akalachia\u2019s body, frowned as he sat in the hastily made barracks.</p><br/><p>According to their original plan, they\u2019d be busy testing out their new body but there was no time to do such a thing.</p><br/><p>Since a tremendous amount of change had occurred after they woke up.</p><br/><p>\u2018At this rate\u2026We need to alter the whole plan.\u2019</p><br/><p>Kel-Durin mumbled quietly.</p><br/><p>Their plan was simple.</p><br/><p>Leave their weak human bodies and move into a much more powerful body.</p><br/><p>They had created new bodies because of this and had even created the Red-Stone and Black-Stone that temporarily froze their conscious and mana to reduce the risk as much as possible while they moved into their new bodies.</p><br/><p>Since they found through experimenting that the chances of failure rose if they had their consciousness and mana.</p><br/><p>So they created the three stones and fell asleep.</p><br/><p>But for them to have been asleep for 800 years.</p><br/><p>\u2018And\u2026The fact that the Makrons who were supposed to be rank 2 bodies were annihilated is a big deal.\u2019</p><br/><p>Kel-Durin frowned.</p><br/><p>Rank 1, the Akalachias created for the royalty.</p><br/><p>Rank 2, the Makrons created for the nobility</p><br/><p>Rank 3, the Arukons created for warriors.</p><br/><p>Rank 4, the Rebeloongs created for commoners.</p><br/><p>The Makronss who were supposed to handle the middle stage had all been annihilated.</p><br/><p>Due to the other three races while they were asleep.</p><br/><p>\u2018Even if we give them mana and a consciousness, they\u2019re still beasts huh. This is going to create problems in the next stage.\u2019</p><br/><p>And because they fought with each other, the already limited mana crystals had run out.</p><br/><p>There was also another issue.</p><br/><p>Kel-Durin clutched his head at the sounds he could hear coming in from outside.</p><br/><p>\u2018The body being developed has its downsides.\u2019</p><br/><p>The extremely developed body allowed him to hear everything.</p><br/><p>But he could not ignore these noises.</p><br/><p>Since it was not something he could ignore.</p><br/><p>Kel-Durin spoke expressionlessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go out. It seems like we will need to speak with the other side for a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Will it be okay? That midget race seems to be extremely aggressive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kan-Kun frowned.</p><br/><p>It had been 3 days since they woke up.</p><br/><p>There had been countless things that happened during that time.</p><br/><p>And Kel-Durin made a tired smile at Kan-Kun.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell. That man seems to have things under control quite well. Let\u2019s trust in that.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seems like while they were asleep, this so-called \u2018God\u2019 had played around a bit and their world seems to be used as a tunnel.</p><br/><p>A bridge to the next world.</p><br/><p>The entrance was the Kangri-Worm\u2019s area.</p><br/><p>And the exit was at a location near the Silver Sea.</p><br/><p>\u2018What a tremendous change. Can we still\u2026 Complete it? Damn. If we took the Black-Stone back then\u2026 There wouldn\u2019t even be a need to ponder about such a thing like this.\u2019</p><br/><p>Kel-Durin thought of the Satellite Fortresses that didn\u2019t work as he walked out of his tent.</p><br/><p>A giant basin.</p><br/><p>His race, that had temporarily gathered here, could be seen.</p><br/><p>Countless Akalachias, Arukons and Rebeloongs.</p><br/><p>They all looked different and had different ranks, they were still a part of the same race.</p><br/><p>And the other side of the basin.</p><br/><p>Countless people had gathered.</p><br/><p>All with a blade of some sort in their hands.</p><br/><p>As he walked out, the sounds he had been hearing became even clearer.</p><br/><p>Well, the enraged roars and shouts.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are we leaving them be!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFucking hell! Do you know how much we suffered because of them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKill them all!\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no need for both sides to be angry with each other in a fight or a war.</p><br/><p>Since one side being angry was enough.</p><br/><p>Kel-Durin clicked his tongue as he looked at the swarming humans looking at him with cold eyes.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

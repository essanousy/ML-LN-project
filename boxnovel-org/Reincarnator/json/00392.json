It drains a lot of my stamina and\u2026 I don\u2019t think we can use it as a means of escape.\u201d</p><br/><p>A new skill.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>She realized after using it.</p><br/><p>One could move with no restrictions to distance, and once the skill was activated, they would become untargetable until it ended.</p><br/><p>But there were a lot of limitations.</p><br/><p>The biggest one was the user\u2019s beliefs during a battle.</p><br/><p>If one used the skill because they decided they couldn\u2019t win in the battle, then the skill would not activate.</p><br/><p>It only activated because she believed Hansoo could still win.</p><br/><p>If she were alone, the skill would\u2019ve never activated.</p><br/><p>\u2018What a petty fairy. Should at least allow me to run away with it.\u2019</p><br/><p>Of course, running away wasn\u2019t the best option, but knowing that one had a means of escape would allow them to fight with more confidence.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo chuckled.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it has a good synergy with your trait.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...Right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiriel nodded.</p><br/><p>Cloudy Movement.</p><br/><p>This meant that to Kiriel, who could read memories, it had a great deal of synergy.</p><br/><p>She had brought herself and Hansoo here using the memories of Erunheim.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019ll be very useful.\u2019</p><br/><p>Kiriel then asked Hansoo:</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyway, why did you want to come here right away?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Instead of beating him.\u2019</p><br/><p>Kiriel didn\u2019t voice her whole opinion.</p><br/><p>It made her sound too blunt.</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked down into the depths and said:</p><br/><p>\u201cI felt like we needed to come here quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he heard the memories that Kiriel read\u2026 </p><br/><p>Hansoo felt that something was amiss.</p><br/><p>A feeling that urged him to hurry.</p><br/><p>If he had engaged in battle, then he would\u2019ve had to fight John Stone and everyone else who followed afterward.</p><br/><p>\u2018It...It doesn\u2019t feel quite right.\u2019</p><br/><p>And he realized it as he looked down.</p><br/><p>As to what was making him feel this uneasy.</p><br/><p>The darkness that had almost separated from the crystal.</p><br/><p>The adventurers who had been cutting away the darkness then shouted at Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Who are you guys?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis place is off-limits?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked around the crystal, the people around it and then turned towards Kiriel.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>His goal was right before his eyes.</p><br/><p>These brats weren\u2019t his opponents at all.</p><br/><p>After speaking to Kiriel, Hansoo jumped into the depths.</p><br/><p>Towards the crystal that was being tied down by the darkness.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

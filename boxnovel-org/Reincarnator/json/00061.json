It\u2019s still quite more amazing than I had thought.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo quickly started to run towards the inner parts of the lake after checking his rear.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Kuuuuuuuuu</p><br/><p>Tens of Gertas were laid out on the floor after becoming roasted by the dark red flame.</p><br/><p>And Cheng and the other Quadratus members gulped as they saw this sight.</p><br/><p>Though thousands of Gertas were running towards them, the man who had created the scene in front of them was much scarier.</p><br/><p>Kalz Morenn, who had dark red flames swirling around his hand, looked at the Gertas he had roasted and then turned around as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hear it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hear about how you are going to deal with this. I\u2019ve gotten curious as to how and why you guys do your job like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 We will take care of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then a few people ran down as they launched off the cruise ship.</p><br/><p>Ooonng.</p><br/><p>The 2000 man cruise ship started to get further and further away from the land.</p><br/><p>The Gertas who had run up roared in anger but they could only roam round the edge of the waters since they had no way of getting close to the cruise ship.</p><br/><p>Kalz Morenn stood still for a moment and then opened his mouth again.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you worrying about my safety right now? I\u2019m asking as to how you are going to perform the sightseeing. If this goes on then all the newcomers will leak out. Can you guys block it all up?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gyesoo stumbled as he carried his injured body and walked out.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll solve it. If I run around the Kukulja lake and lead those things then the newcomers will see that and\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Kududuk.</p><br/><p>\u201cAaakk!\u201d</p><br/><p>Gyesoo screamed as Kalz Morenn\u2019s hand suddenly dug into his thigh.</p><br/><p>Kalz Morenn ignored his screams as he dug his thigh out and then pulled out a soggy reddish mixture.</p><br/><p>Kyaaak!</p><br/><p>As the mixture came out from his body the Gertas started to get even more agitated.</p><br/><p>Kalz Moren threw that towards the Quadratus and then spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis guy is the guide, he can\u2019t die. Take this and spread it along the roads.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Understood.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Quadratus felt cold sweats run down their backs as they looked at the shore where the Gertas were going crazy.</p><br/><p>They had to carry this around and then spread it along the roads.</p><br/><p>Though they can bring back the Gertas onto the roads if they spread this but carrying this around meant that they had to keep all of those Gertas on their tails.</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t even imagine the number of people who would die during this process.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damnit. It got screwed up real dirty.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cheng looked at Gyesoo with a resentful expression.</p><br/><p>But he could only go.</p><br/><p>If not then he would probably die in the hands of Kalz Morenn instead of the Gertas.</p><br/><p>It seemed like that Kalz Morenn, who was full of anticipation, started to feel worse and worse as the plans got screwed up.</p><br/><p>\u2018If we can settle the matter for now with this then it\u2019ll be good.\u2019</p><br/><p>But Kalz Morenn destroyed Cheng\u2019s anticipation.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd what are you going to do about that Hansoo fellow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTake responsibility and bring him over. I really want to see his face now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng clenched his teeth and then shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlug up the roads first! Then\u2026 find that guy with the lake as the main location!\u201d</p><br/><p>A guy who had set them up like this wouldn\u2019t have hidden.</p><br/><p>\u2018He said he was going to kill the Calamity Fish right.\u2019</p><br/><p>Since that guy was doing something in the Kukulja lake then he wouldn\u2019t be able to leave far until that was accomplished.</p><br/><p>Kalz Morenn then looked at Gyesoo with a cold expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou will talk to me for a bit. About what you failed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUuuuu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Gyesoo made a expression filled with fear from those terrifying eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>Kudududuk.</p><br/><p>Hansoo stabbed the Kukulja\u2019s skull and then quickly stabbed into the heart, pulled the heart out and then threw it into the Selfish Wealthy man\u2019s Food Jar.</p><br/><p>The efficiency fell in comparison to squeezing it out on land but he didn\u2019t have the confidence to drag them onto land.</p><br/><p>Shhkung.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ve still almost collected it all.\u2019</p><br/><p>The by his waist had almost been filled up due to him hunting for almost two days straight.</p><br/><p>But there was still a problem.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026My stamina is too spent.\u2019</p><br/><p>The place where he could get the Nutritional Liquid was a bit far away from the Kukulja\u2019s Lake.</p><br/><p>His stomach was completely empty after fighting for two days straight without any nutriments.</p><br/><p>Slashing the sword once was getting hard.</p><br/><p>Kadududuk!</p><br/><p>The Kukulja noticed Hansoo getting weaker as they rushed towards him even more crazily.</p><br/><p>At that moment something cut through the toxic waters and flew towards him while making pagagak sounds.</p><br/><p>An arrow filled with the power of a skill.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s a skill of the targeting type.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo compressed the free-form blade and then swung it.</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>He had deflected the arrow but the injuries that had barely healed ripped open, due to him straining the muscles of his whole body , and spread around as the Kukuljas who smelled this started to thrash around more aggressively.</p><br/><p>A person who looked like a commander of the Quadratus was looking towards him by the lakeshore and was preparing a skill.</p><br/><p>\u2018It seems they have stopped the fire for now.\u2019</p><br/><p>Actually, the two days he had gained were quite a lot.</p><br/><p>Though it would\u2019ve been nicer to have a bit more, it happened already.</p><br/><p>He had to solve this situation.</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t have the strength to have a prolonged battle.\u2019</p><br/><p>He was hungry, was lacking in stamina due to the long fight he had and was losing blood as well.</p><br/><p>And Kukuljas were rushing towards him crazily from below.</p><br/><p>But he still had to complete the extract.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ll get rid of the guys who follow me.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo stepped onto the heads of the crazily rushing Kukuljas as he started to run towards the other side of the lake very quickly.</p><br/><p>And Cheng grinded his teeth as he saw this.</p><br/><p>\u201cShoot out restraining skills so he won\u2019t run away and chase him!\u201d</p><br/><p>The other commanders made a bitter expression at this.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to go in there?\u201d</p><br/><p>The bridge trick that Hansoo had done wasn\u2019t hard for them.</p><br/><p>And hunting down a tired person was an easy task for them.</p><br/><p>But even with all this it was still a bit burdensome for them to go into the lake which was swarming with Kukuljas.</p><br/><p>Cheng shouted at those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe conditions are still the same! And don\u2019t you know that it\u2019ll become more tiresome if you don\u2019t catch him while he\u2019s that tired? And say we don\u2019t catch him here\u2026 what are you going to report then?\u201d</p><br/><p>If he runs away to the other side of the lake then it really becomes hard to catch him.</p><br/><p>Since the Kukulja lake was as big as the vast End Root.</p><br/><p>If he hid in the jungle then things become really tiresome.</p><br/><p>Everyone gulped at those words.</p><br/><p>If they miss the chance to catch him while he\u2019s tired then they have to meet Kalz Morenn.</p><br/><p>They could still clearly remember the scene where Kalz Morenn dipped Gyesoo into the sea and pulled him back out like Shabu Shabu as he asked him about his responsibilities.</p><br/><p>Gyesoo had only stopped at a half-body bath in the toxic waters because he had the experience of the insides of the Calamity Fish.</p><br/><p>If they fail then they might take on a full body bath instead of a half-body bath.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fucker. We aren\u2019t even below that guy!\u2019</p><br/><p>But such a lame excuse did not work in this world where the differences in power were clear.</p><br/><p>Since they had signed the contract to bring that guy back it was likely that they will suffer if they were to even discuss about it.</p><br/><p>The commanders, who were grinding their teeth, and the other Quadratus floated on pieces of wood or Ghweche seeds as they quickly pursued Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u2018You bitch. I\u2019ve almost caught you! I\u2019ll vent all my anger on you!\u2019</p><br/><p>Unlike them, who were running with not many obstructions, their target with a bloody body was being attacked by the Kukuljas.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Hansoo suddenly stepped onto the Kukulja as he jumped up into the air.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>A formless energy flowed into the sword on his hand as it instantly turned into a whip.</p><br/><p>\u201cBlock it!\u201d</p><br/><p>At those words the people who had been running activated their skills to guard their fatal spots and focused on regaining their balance.</p><br/><p>Pik.</p><br/><p>Pipipik.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026Mmm?\u2019</p><br/><p>Cheng made a confused expression at the whip that had swept around them.</p><br/><p>The glamorous attack just swept around their limbs as if it wasn\u2019t targeting their fatal spots from the beginning.</p><br/><p>It was extremely sharp so their flesh was cut but it wasn\u2019t in fatal locations.</p><br/><p>Cheng smirked as he saw this.</p><br/><p>\u2018Did he perhaps think that we will run away from fear when we got injured?\u2019</p><br/><p>Bleeding actually did make things a bit more burdensome.</p><br/><p>Since Kukuljas will charge onto them if they bled.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo was bleeding much more than them anyway and this amount of injury would heal up before a minute was up.</p><br/><p>But the moment Cheng and the other Quadratus tried to rush in enthusiastically, something unexpected occured.</p><br/><p>Chwuuuuk.</p><br/><p>The injuries got wider and wider as a large amount of blood started to flow out.</p><br/><p>\u201cUuk! What is this!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeal! Use the healing rune!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit! It won\u2019t close up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Blood was pouring out from the injury made by the whip.</p><br/><p>And the Kukuljas, who had smelled the blood that had been spilt on the waters, rushed at them madly.</p><br/><p>Pududududk.</p><br/><p>\u201cWaak! Damnit!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018What is this nonsense!\u2019</p><br/><p>Cheng screamed inwardly in puzzlement as he struck at the Kukuljas charging at him.</p><br/><p>He was sure that such an option wasn\u2019t on Gyesoo\u2019s sword.</p><br/><p>Hansoo made a cold expression at the top of the lake which had become chaos itself.</p><br/><p>\u2018Now our situations are a bit more equal.\u2019</p><br/><p>The second power the had unlocked after it evolved into a Red Artifact.</p><br/><p>Once you were hit by the attack filled with the strange power of Nurmaha then the injury will not heal while the power lingered on the injury and instead cause a large amount of blood to pour out.</p><br/><p>A top rated skill which was fatal towards the guys who trust in their healing skills and fight recklessly.</p><br/><p>He had been saving it because the mana usage was very large but this was the perfect time for it.</p><br/><p>\u2018But this isn\u2019t quite enough.\u2019</p><br/><p>He was still bleeding as well and the Kukuljas were charging at him and them without distinguishing between them.</p><br/><p>It had just become even.</p><br/><p>And the fight was better the more unfair it was.</p><br/><p>Hansoo ripped off the sap that was covering the blade with his hands.</p><br/><p>Then the scent of the Forgotten Sword, which had been hidden beneath the strong Amar scent, started to permeate all around.</p><br/><p>The Kukuljas who had smelled this flinched in surprise as they crazily tried to distance themselves away from Hansoo.</p><br/><p>They could only be scared.</p><br/><p>Since this scent was that of the fearful predator that ate them as snacks.</p><br/><p>Pudududuk Pudududuk.</p><br/><p>As the scent which could be smelled from hundreds of meters away under water spread, the Kukuljas made a huge riot in order to get away from Hansoo.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo used this timing to throw the seeds to create the bridge as he got out to the lakeshore.</p><br/><p>Then he looked at the relic on his hand.</p><br/><p>This was an object that had been kept within the Calamity Fish for a very long time.</p><br/><p>Its scent could only be strong.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t hunt properly if the Kukuljas ran away so he had hidden this scent but this was the most effective way in order to escape like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhhhk!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018They won\u2019t be able to come out.\u2019</p><br/><p>That place was dangerous even for him.</p><br/><p>Since the fear of the predator that had appeared for a moment had increased their vicious instincts a step further.</p><br/><p>Hansoo, who had been looking at the Kukuljas who were gathering onto the center of the lake in a crazy manner, hid the scent of the Forgotten sword again as he completed the Kukulja extract.</p><br/><p>Hansoo sighed as he looked at the mess his body had turned into.</p><br/><p>He had predicted that it wouldn\u2019t be easy but it was extremely tiring.</p><br/><p>There was a huge difference between the beasts of the Red Zone and the people of the Tutorial.</p><br/><p>\u2018Keldian.

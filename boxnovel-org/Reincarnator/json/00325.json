Why? Why, when he has so much strength\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The guy, who looked to be barely twenty, was almost going mad with worry.</p><br/><p>Of course it made sense.</p><br/><p>Since he was part of the lucky few.</p><br/><p>He had been able to come up to the Green Zone without facing a single hurdle in just one year.</p><br/><p>And the moment he got up to the zone, he had become a transcendent after being found by that guy.</p><br/><p>To him, this current life was probably much more fun than his old one back in the real world.</p><br/><p>He was probably an A+ nerd who\u2019d been ignored by everyone.</p><br/><p>But after coming here, he had basically become a king.</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t hesitated to abuse his power either.</p><br/><p>Even Hermes was shocked at how good Ares was at killing and pouncing on women.</p><br/><p>That was one of the reasons he had named him Ares as well.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026We have no other options. We have to go to that man.\u2019</p><br/><p>That man probably had something up his sleeves since he was preparing to fight that monster.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026I just don\u2019t have enough intel. Damn\u2026 I don\u2019t like having to get help from some unknown stranger.\u2019</p><br/><p>But as Hermes was about to speak to Zeus\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014parrrrrrrrk\u2014 </p><br/><p>A bird flew towards them at a very fast speed.</p><br/><p>To Ares.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026Flier? A message? From who? Athena? Poseidon? Or is it Artemis?\u2019</p><br/><p>Very childish names they were, but they were easy to memorize.</p><br/><p>\u2018I hope it\u2019s Athena\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Hermes mumbled, as he thought about the mysterious woman who always seemed to have been hiding something.</p><br/><p>Ares shouted out in glee.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can live! Hahahaha! We\u2019ll live! Long live Poseidon! Hahaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? What are you saying?\u2019</p><br/><p>Everybody made confused faces at Ares who was laughing like a madman, and he continued to scream:</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s done! Poseidon has almost killed that monster! With Artemis! Hahaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>The faces of everybody changed.</p><br/><p>The fire was put out.</p><br/><p>According to Hades, that monster had the ability to find them like a hunting dog.</p><br/><p>That was why they\u2019d been afraid.</p><br/><p>But that monster was now dead.</p><br/><p>Though that man guarding the elevator was strong, he wouldn\u2019t be able to find them.</p><br/><p>Just how large was this continent?</p><br/><p>They could just all split up and slowly get stronger.</p><br/><p>\u2018Good! Good! Good!\u2019</p><br/><p>Ares smiled.</p><br/><p>This was how it should\u2019ve been.</p><br/><p>No matter how strong the monster was, it shouldn\u2019t have been able to threaten transcendents like themselves.</p><br/><p>Humans were the king of the world, and only other transcendents were worthy opponents for them.</p><br/><p>If a monster that strong already existed, why hadn\u2019t they seen them around by now?</p><br/><p>At this point, there should\u2019ve been plenty of monsters who were weaker than that black shadow, but stronger than the Kang-Kions all over the continent.</p><br/><p>But as Ares smiled\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014Hermes smiled back and said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026 Our business is finished, right? Let\u2019s split up then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? What?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014boooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The space below Hermes exploded as his body disappeared in a flash.</p><br/><p>Into the distance.</p><br/><p>And Ares was at a loss.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why is that fogey in such a rush?\u2019</p><br/><p>They could at least discuss their next plan of action, right?</p><br/><p>It was really rare for so many of them to gather in one place.</p><br/><p>But Ares suddenly realized something as he stared at the shape of Hermes disappearing into the distance.</p><br/><p>\u2018Where is he\u2026?\u2019</p><br/><p>The direction which the Flier had come from.</p><br/><p>Which was the direction where Poseidon\u2019s base was located.</p><br/><p>Hermes was going in that exact direction.</p><br/><p>Ares had forgotten about it for a moment.</p><br/><p>That monster was also an abyssal creature.</p><br/><p>An extremely strong one at that.</p><br/><p>\u2018F***! That thing should have left a ton of crystals!\u2019</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know how Poseidon and Artemis had almost killed it, but if that thing was as strong as he\u2019d heard, those two should be half dead as well.</p><br/><p>So if one of them could get there, and then finish them all off, then they could reap an endless amount of benefits.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u201cHow cold. I\u2019m going to go help Poseidon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too, I\u2019m quite close with Artemis.\u201d</p><br/><p>The transcendents started to leave one-by-one.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Ares started to charge towards Poseidon\u2019s base as well.</p><br/><p>\u2018If I can have that crystal\u2026 I\u2019ll be able to beat that b****, Athena!\u2019</p><br/><p>The woman who\u2019d made his heart beat.</p><br/><p>Which was why he\u2019d always been depressed about it.</p><br/><p>Since she was stronger than him.</p><br/><p>If she was weaker, he would\u2019ve been able to dominate her.</p><br/><p>This was the perfect chance.</p><br/><p>For revenge.</p><br/><p>He had been beaten halfway to death after trying it get it on with her in the past.</p><br/><p>Ares threw away the message and disappeared into the horizon as well.</p><br/><p>To chase after those who had gone first.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn\u2026what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeus was at a loss for words as he looked at his comrades charging off with greed-filled eyes.</p><br/><p>Even the Dark King, whose feet had been cut off, was charging over.</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t feel good about this.\u2019</p><br/><p>With a worried expression, Zeus picked up the message Ares had thrown away.</p><br/><p>It was clearly Poseidon\u2019s handwriting.</p><br/><p>But something felt amiss.</p><br/><p>Zeus made a different decision as he headed towards Hansoo\u2019s location.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014 </p><br/><p>A snow-covered tundra.</p><br/><p>A giant hill which originally held a cave had melted down entirely.</p><br/><p>\u2014bubble bubble\u2014 </p><br/><p>And from the middle of the melted-down land\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014a man stood up.</p><br/><p>\u2018Good.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo moved his hands around as he checked the status of his body.</p><br/><p>The attempt was a success.</p><br/><p>The spores of the Pandemic Blade were no longer a threat to him.</p><br/><p>No, they were now a powerful part of his strength.</p><br/><p>\u2014sssssk\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo mumbled to himself as he looked at the red cloud floating around his body.</p><br/><p>\u2018Should I have done this from the beginning\u2026?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo felt the tremendous amount of strength inside him.</p><br/><p>With this, he would be able to do a lot more.</p><br/><p>But he soon shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u2014bubble bubble\u2014 </p><br/><p>Everything within a few-hundred-meters radius had entirely melted down.</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t been able to fully suppress the toxins of the Pandemic Blade during the process.</p><br/><p>If he had done it with ease, this wouldn\u2019t have happened in the first place.</p><br/><p>Which meant that it was a very close call.</p><br/><p>He had only succeeded because his body had gotten used to it; if he had tried this from the very beginning then it wouldn\u2019t have stopped at just melting him.</p><br/><p>\u2014bubble bubble bubble\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo stood up from the bubbling land and looked towards the distance.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s head on over.\u2019</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u201cYo! Did you succeed?!\u201d</p><br/><p>A familiar voice was heard.</p><br/><p>Zeus\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>Hansoo jumped up, landed by Zeus and spoke to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a dissapointment. I told you to bring everyone else, but you only brought one?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeus was at a loss.</p><br/><p>He brought someone?</p><br/><p>\u2014sss\u2014 </p><br/><p>Somebody appeared out of thin air.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh\u2026 Amazing. This is one of my hidden cards.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeus was shocked to see the man who had followed him.</p><br/><p>He was someone who should not be here.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the\u2026Hermes? Why are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hermes touched the goosebumps on his arms as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t feel right about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018So I lured them away.\u2019</p><br/><p>There were plenty of brains within the group.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha!

Where is he?\u2019</p><br/><p>As Ares looked around with a hurried expression.</p><br/><p>He saw someone on the ground in the distance.</p><br/><p>And he rushed over the moment he realized who it was.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Poseidon? Did he get killed?\u2019</p><br/><p>That colorful outfit was hard to miss.</p><br/><p>Ares flew over and shook Poseidon.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! What happened! You said you almost won! Where did that monster go!?\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t care about Poseidon\u2019s health, but if that monster was still alive and kicking, it would be a huge issue.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014</p><br/><p>A strange voice came out from Poseidon.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight\u2026here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>While Ares was feeling shocked by the strange voice\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014crunch\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014Poseidon\u2019s body started to twist and turn in a weird angle.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ares freaked out and tried to push Poseidon away, but it was too late.</p><br/><p>A dark mouth charged out from Poseidon\u2019s shoulder and chomped down on Ares\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u2014kwaduk\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u201cUAHH!\u201d</p><br/><p>A happy voice came out from Poseidon\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf\u2026eat\u2026you. Two more.\u201d</p><br/><p>It even knew their names.</p><br/><p>Demeter, Artemis, Poseidon, Ares.</p><br/><p>Two more.</p><br/><p>After two more, it would be able to evolve.</p><br/><p>\u2014crunch\u2014 </p><br/><p>Poseidon\u2019s mouth split apart as he swallowed Ares whole.</p><br/><p>\u2014crunch crunch\u2014 </p><br/><p>The Ark-Roa\u2019s shape started to change again.</p><br/><p>To look like Ares which it had just eaten.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>A strange voice came out from his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2026hey! F\u2026found it! Found it! Guys, I found it!\u201d</p><br/><p>It started off weird, but soon it was able to perfectly copy Ares\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>It then started to laugh coldly at the thought of the others who should be rushing over at any moment now.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

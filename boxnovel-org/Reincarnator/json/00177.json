Wait up for a bit!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ekidu was dumbfounded at the sudden change in tone after climbing out from the Triple Fusion Beast\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u2018Heh, look how he changes.\u2019</p><br/><p>But Marun didn\u2019t even take a glance at Ekidu as he walked towards Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u2018It seems this guy is the boss here.\u2019</p><br/><p>He had thought that Ekidu was the leader at the beginning.</p><br/><p>There were times when a smart person or a kind person became a leader.</p><br/><p>But it wouldn\u2019t last long.</p><br/><p>Since a ruthless person who can deal with the problems in times of danger was the one who made decisions instead of the person who can talk around the problem.</p><br/><p>And he had never seen someone as strong as Ekidu even after moving to another village.</p><br/><p>But as they say the world is large, for him to be able to meet someone even stronger.</p><br/><p>The one who had killed the beast was Ekidu but if that guy wasn\u2019t there to block that unstoppable beam, it wouldn\u2019t even have been possible.</p><br/><p>That was why he was trying to talk to Hansoo instead.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yeah. Just stand still behind me.\u2019</p><br/><p>Marun looked back at the Hunters who were all staring at him from behind, walked up to Hansoo and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince it looks like there isn\u2019t much time, let\u2019s get to the point right away. I don\u2019t know why you three are traveling as only three but let\u2019s go together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiiiiing!</p><br/><p>Constant screams of the Triple Fusion Beasts were heard from all around.</p><br/><p>\u2018Where the hell did these things pop out from anyway?\u2019</p><br/><p>Marun frowned as he heard the screams and roars that rang throughout the entire forest.</p><br/><p>Karhal\u2019s condensed Quintuple Beam had barely been able to leave a hole in its body.</p><br/><p>If he had tried to make the hole a bit larger then he might\u2019ve even failed.</p><br/><p>These things had a monstrous amount of defense.</p><br/><p>Even him, who had the unique item Snake\u2019s Path, would have a hard time trying to create a hole like the one Karhal had made.</p><br/><p>But for these things to suddenly pop out.</p><br/><p>Marun looked calm on the outside but he was urgent on the inside.</p><br/><p>There was no time to leave a good impression.</p><br/><p>Faster.</p><br/><p>He needed to show him that the two groups needed each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs you can see, we have a lot of people and every one of us are veteran Hunters. We were ambushed just now but we can be quite a formidable force if we combine our strength. I don\u2019t know what kind of goals or thoughts you have but i think it would be better to head towards a single direction together instead of being enemies.\u201d</p><br/><p>Though 30 had died, they still had around 470 people.</p><br/><p>There wouldn\u2019t be a group larger than them in this forest.</p><br/><p>Maybe a hundred people more at most.</p><br/><p>If there weren\u2019t beasts like that then he had the confidence to smash apart everything else until the end of the Green Road.</p><br/><p>Hansoo chuckled at Marun\u2019s words which contained a trace of a threat.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what kind of thoughts I have or where I\u2019m headed to but for you to want to come with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Marun made a confused expression.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know what kind of thoughts Hansoo had but it shouldn\u2019t be that much out of the box.</p><br/><p>Since the goals of everyone traversing through this damned world was one.</p><br/><p>Survival.</p><br/><p>Hansoo then motioned towards the Triple Beast\u2019s Corpse with the tip of his chin while looking at Marun.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m now going to the nest of these things.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026These things?\u2019</p><br/><p>Karhal was the one who had actually freaked out from Hansoo\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>A nest meant that it was where these things lived and that there were swarms of these things around.</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded at Karhal\u2019s reaction.</p><br/><p>Triple Fusion Beast, a beast that the Sages had created.</p><br/><p>The desperate Sages had combined the three Races and had created this but these large things couldn\u2019t be kept under control and they couldn\u2019t handle their own instincts as they prioritized the weak.</p><br/><p>The beasts, after judging that the Sages were weaker than them, had gone on a rampage to rip apart the Sages and so the Sages could only trap them in the underground Maze.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>A key part of the last line of defense of the Sages.</p><br/><p>And now it was the base of Mount Liang, the ones who were in charge of the funnel.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s now time to get to the headquarters.\u2019</p><br/><p>He needed to get in before the doors closed.</p><br/><p>Into the maze where the Triple Fusion Beasts came out from.</p><br/><p>And he needed to get the item inside that place, the .</p><br/><p>\u201cHaving a lot of people isn\u2019t quite useful in the maze you see.\u201d</p><br/><p>The maze was a complex structure created to go up against the Higher Races that were invading them.</p><br/><p>It was created for a small number of people for a reason.</p><br/><p>Nothing will be gained if a group tried to swarm through the narrow passages.</p><br/><p>Since the best place to show off the might of numbers is the wide plains.</p><br/><p>Swarming into such a narrow place would only hinder each other\u2019s attacks.</p><br/><p>Hansoo then pointed behind Marun and started to pick people out.</p><br/><p>\u201cHim. Him. Him. Him\u2026 A total of eight. The rest would only get in the way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Marun frowned at Hansoo\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026This bastard. He has some amazing sense or is it something else?\u2019</p><br/><p>The ones Hansoo had picked just now were the strongest of the 470 here.</p><br/><p>They were the Guards of the village.</p><br/><p>Of course they were much stronger and had better equipment than the Hunters.</p><br/><p>But Marun had purposely made their attires similar to the Hunter\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Since the enemy would be more wary of a special-looking opponent.</p><br/><p>There shouldn\u2019t be that many differences from a glance but for him to pick them out so meticulously.</p><br/><p>\u2018And\u2026 He\u2019s going to go into their nest?\u2019</p><br/><p>Marun pondered.</p><br/><p>In order find out what the hell this crazy guy was thinking about.</p><br/><p>\u2018Shall I threaten him a bit?\u2019</p><br/><p>There was a reason why people did crazy things.</p><br/><p>There are always rewards that suited the crazy and risky things people do.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well\u2026It\u2019s just a threat.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo wouldn\u2019t try to fight their group or anything due to their numbers.</p><br/><p>Marun thought about this and then flinched after seeing Hansoo\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fucking hell\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>There was a beast in the past which had similar eyes to Hansoo right now.</p><br/><p>2nd level Beast, Erona.</p><br/><p>A 4m large beast which looked like a red lion and marked its territory by smashing trees down with its front leg.</p><br/><p>And unlike how it looked, it was a herbivore as it ignored other beasts and only ate the trees within its territory.</p><br/><p>If you don\u2019t cross over to its territory then it wouldn\u2019t do anything to you no matter what you do even if you were right in front of it.</p><br/><p>And the newbies often make the mistake.</p><br/><p>That it\u2019s a timid beast.</p><br/><p>And in order to gain the egg of an Erona, which was said to be extremely precious and rare, they often cross over the clearly marked territorial line.</p><br/><p>Nobody knew what happened to them.</p><br/><p>Since none of them had come back to the village.</p><br/><p>The current situation felt just like that.</p><br/><p>Like he had come right up to the boundary of Hansoo\u2019s territory.</p><br/><p>The moment he tried to work around it he would lose his head.</p><br/><p>He had cold sweat running down his back because the twitching spearhead felt like it would pierce through his neck at any moment.</p><br/><p>His group might be able to win if they fight but what would it matter if his head was cut off already.</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>Roooaarr!</p><br/><p>A desolate cry was heard.</p><br/><p>From very nearby.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you have nothing to say then we\u2019ll head off first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo left with those words.</p><br/><p>The Triple Fusion Beasts would come here if they remained.</p><br/><p>\u2018We\u2019ll only get dragged down dealing with those guys.\u2019</p><br/><p>There was a time limit for how long the entrance to the Maze stayed open.</p><br/><p>He needed to hurry up and get in before more of them swarmed to him.</p><br/><p>Since there was another reason to go into the maze other than the Defeated King\u2019s Crown.</p><br/><p>Tadadak!</p><br/><p>\u201cPhew\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Marun finally relaxed after Hansoo, Ekidu and Karhal disappeared and sighed as he balanced himself with Snake\u2019s Path.</p><br/><p>And Mekill, one of the ex-guards, asked Marun while looking at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cShall we chase? What should we do? It smells a bit fishy.\u201d</p><br/><p>They would be able to catch them if they chased.</p><br/><p>Since their specialties were more for hunting rather than a clash.</p><br/><p>\u2018Mmm\u2026.\u2019</p><br/><p>Marun started to ponder after hearing Mekill\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Booooom!</p><br/><p>\u201cGet behind me!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Hansoo shouted.</p><br/><p>Karhal and Ekidu quickly made their bodies smaller as they hid behind Hansoo.</p><br/><p>And then.</p><br/><p>Booooooom!</p><br/><p>A beam of laser flew in from the distance and smashed into Hansoo.</p><br/><p>Jiiijijijik</p><br/><p>A hot wave of heat radiated into all directions.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo continued to run.</p><br/><p>He was now ignoring the Triple Fusion Beasts and was just running.</p><br/><p>And thanks to this the Triple Fusion Beast who was chasing was able to continue to send out it\u2019s Destruction Beams without being attacked back.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fucking hell\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Karhal clenched his teeth while feeling the intense heat all over his body.</p><br/><p>Just the heat itself was this much.</p><br/><p>\u2018We have to dive into the place where it\u2019s swarming with these things?\u2019</p><br/><p>Karhal made a desperate expression from the situation which was much more dangerous than he had expected.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t like he volunteered because he wanted to help out.</p><br/><p>He had just stuck with him in case he would be able to find his long lost younger sibling if he followed him.</p><br/><p>If this guy really beat up all the Higher Races then finding his sibling who had been taken away by the Blue Jade being found wasn\u2019t a dream.</p><br/><p>But for things to be like this.</p><br/><p>While Karhal was applying every skill he had onto Hansoo.</p><br/><p>Booooom!</p><br/><p>Another beam of light smashed onto Hansoo.</p><br/><p>It might\u2019ve been easy if they dealt with one at a time while advancing but due to them just continuing to run, another one had caught up to them.</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s body got pushed back as it got hit by two Destruction Beams.</p><br/><p>Paaaaang!</p><br/><p>Ekidu saw this scene and then covered her entire body with the White River Demonic Art and jumped in front of Hansoo.</p><br/><p>Chiijijijik</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>A tremendous amount of pain.</p><br/><p>It melted down the White River Demonic Art and heated up the Scarlet Yang Armor.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damnit. It\u2019s just one beam!\u2019</p><br/><p>She had taken one of the two beams that was smashing into Hansoo but it was this painful.</p><br/><p>Ekidu shouted out urgently.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>Karhal had condensed the Quintuple Beam while Hansoo and Ekidu bought him time and then shot it towards the Triple Fusion Beast.</p><br/><p>Booooom!</p><br/><p>Grrrrr!</p><br/><p>The Triple Fusion\u2019s Beast swayed as a single beam stopped as Hansoo, Ekidu and Karhal started to run away from them.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamnit man! Why are we hurrying so much! We can just deal with them one by one on the way! Or go in the next time!\u201d</p><br/><p>Karhal shouted towards Hansoo who was running towards the entrance of the Maze like a mad bull.</p><br/><p>Even if those beasts called for help, they still had a lot of time until they reached the Maze.</p><br/><p>They could just deal with them one by one but why was he running in such a hurry.</p><br/><p>It was the same for the one back there.</p><br/><p>A full frontal battle would be hard but they could deal with it if they used their tactics.</p><br/><p>Why were they leaving those things behind?</p><br/><p>But Hansoo shook his head.</p><br/><p>Those things weren\u2019t the issue right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no time. We have to get into the maze when the door opens this time no matter what!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Booooom!</p><br/><p>Hansoo blocked another beam of laser which had flown into him and then looked into the distance where he had self-destructed Dakidus\u2019s Satellite Fortress.</p><br/><p>He had stopped the interference of the Satellite Fortresses.</p><br/><p>But those Higher Races weren\u2019t stupid.</p><br/><p>They should\u2019ve figured it out by now.</p><br/><p>That the current situation would be impossible without somebody else\u2019s interference.</p><br/><p>\u2018I know\u2026 Something will definitely come.\u2019</p><br/><p>This was why they needed to hide within the Maze.</p><br/><p>The Maze was a place the Sages had built with the Higher Races in mind.</p><br/><p>It was a very useful structure to buy time from the ones chasing them.</p><br/><p>\u2018And\u2026 Gain the King\u2019s Crown during that time. It\u2019ll be good if a suspicious guy came.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo continued to think as he saw the entrance of the Maze that had started to appear in the distance.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go and try to catch them.\u201d</p><br/><p>No matter how much he thought, trying to go in despite the huge amount of possible danger was strange.</p><br/><p>\u2018Taking that wouldn\u2019t be bad either.\u2019</p><br/><p>As Marun made his decision and spoke to Mekill.</p><br/><p>Boooooooom!</p><br/><p>Something giant fell down from the skies.</p><br/><p>And from this Mekill\u2019s entire body had been smashed apart right next to Marun.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>Marun freaked out as the person who he was talking to next to him had gotten smashed apart and then quickly shot out the Snake\u2019s Path.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019ll work even if it\u2019s the Triple Fusion beast.\u2019</p><br/><p>But Marun\u2019s hope had been smashed apart.</p><br/><p>Tuudududuk</p><br/><p>The arrow which had flown away with a vicious red aura had turned into a pile of powder near the opponent\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>From the strange barrier around the opponent\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>And Marun fell into despair after he saw this.</p><br/><p>Not because his attacks hadn\u2019t worked but because he checked the identity of the opponent.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why\u2026Why is the Arukon here.\u2019</p><br/><p>A wolfman who had their entire body covered with the powerful mana of the Blue Jade.</p><br/><p>This place wasn\u2019t the ceasefire zone.</p><br/><p>And this one didn\u2019t look simple either.</p><br/><p>It was a full head taller than Dakidus whom he had seen in the past, a 5m tall wolf.</p><br/><p>And it even had some special gear.</p><br/><p>It was just a meter difference but the bulky muscles and the rough-looking furs radiated a fearsome aura which couldn\u2019t even be compared to that of Dakidus.</p><br/><p>Sssssk</p><br/><p>The Judge, Akitrus, who was looking around while ignoring Marun who had fallen onto the ground and then picked up the terrified bug in front of his eyes.</p><br/><p>Humans whom he had found while tracking the traces from the village Dakidus was supposed to visit last.</p><br/><p>They might be of help.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me everything you know. Is there a special human who has gone past this place?\u201d</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t much detail he needed to ask.</p><br/><p>Since someone like him shouldn\u2019t be normal.</p><br/><p>Grrrrr.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Marun made a terrified expression at the intense amounts of deadly aura he felt but then suddenly shouted out in glee as if he had remembered something.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! There is! Yes! He said he was going to the Underground Maze!\u201d</p><br/><p>Akitrus raised his brows at those words and then smiled contently after thinking for a moment.</p><br/><p>And then smashed an arm of Marun.</p><br/><p>Crack.</p><br/><p>\u201cUaaaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe ones running away kindly told you their destination?\u201d</p><br/><p>Akitrus erased the smile on his face and then mumbled coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are making me really angry. Thanks to you it\u2019s now even more confusing&gt;\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! It\u2019s real..Uaaaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>Screams of despair rang throughout the Jungle.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

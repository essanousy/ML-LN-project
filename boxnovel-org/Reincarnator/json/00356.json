from the depths (5)</p><br/><p>She\u2019d dreamed of this moment.</p><br/><p>Of meeting him again and climbing up again.</p><br/><p>But it didn\u2019t matter anymore.</p><br/><p>She\u2019d been captured, and her body no longer followed her commands.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s too\u2026 tiring.\u2019</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin\u2019s conscious lay in a fetal position.</p><br/><p>She could sense the ripples of battle outside the dark space where her consciousness was.</p><br/><p>But she didn\u2019t want to care anymore.</p><br/><p>There was nothing she could do anyway, and plus, she was really tired.</p><br/><p>\u2018Will you be able to kill me?\u2019</p><br/><p>Being modified inside the research lab, killing people outside all in the name of \u2018testing\u2019, and living as a scarecrow that followed orders.</p><br/><p>As well as\u2026 living in this damned world.</p><br/><p>She was tired of it all.</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know who you are, but\u2026 I hope you succeed.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhhhhh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014boooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo shouted at Enbi Arin who was screaming in rage as she charged towards him.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome back now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo swung his Mjolnir and smashed it onto Enbi Arin\u2019s fist.</p><br/><p>It created a tremendous shockwave between the hammer, which was larger than Enbi Arin\u2019s head, and her fist.</p><br/><p>\u2014crackakak!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo grit his teeth as he looked at the fist and the blue armor surrounding it.</p><br/><p>\u2018...It seems she\u2019s not thinking of waking up.\u2019</p><br/><p>As Melchizedek had left it, Enbi Arin\u2019s body was the same as a shell.</p><br/><p>A shell without a control tower, just acting on impulse.</p><br/><p>The issue was that this body was extremely enraged.</p><br/><p>Rage was instinctive for survival.</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin\u2019s body was currently burning up in rage and was struggling with all its strength to survive.</p><br/><p>As if this was the only way to survive.</p><br/><p>And as if the body was trying to prove this, the red aura surrounding Enbi Arin turned even more vibrant.</p><br/><p>\u2014booooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Enbi Arin leaped off the ground and charged towards Hansoo.</p><br/><p>She\u2019d simply stepped off the ground, but the entire floor shook as if there\u2019d been an earthquake.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo helplessly struck out with Mjolnir again as he watched this.</p><br/><p>Since he couldn\u2019t just sit around and get hit.</p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The hammer and fist collided again as the resulting shockwave swept the surroundings again.</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked sadly at Enbi Arin, who was becoming even stronger and faster than before.</p><br/><p>\u201cWake\u2026UP!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Finding a gap in her movements, Hansoo smacked face again and shouted.</p><br/><p>At this rate, one of them would definitely die.</p><br/><p>Tainted Emotions was the epitome of survival instincts.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a skill without risk and gave her strength whenever she got angry.</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin had told him this in the past.</p><br/><p>The angrier she got, the more the current body used up its future body\u2019s potential to protect itself.</p><br/><p>It was obvious, but\u2026 the longer she used it, the more it gnawed on her body.</p><br/><p>\u2018And that body\u2026 \u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014squirm squirm\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo frowned at the armor connected to her body through various spikes and spines, squirming as if it were alive.</p><br/><p>Armor that continuously sucked out the energy from one\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>It looked extremely efficient, but of course, such efficiency wasn\u2019t free.</p><br/><p>No.</p><br/><p>The armor seemed to want the body to continue using its power\u2014it was pushing Enbi Arin even more.</p><br/><p>Making her continue to fight.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo grinded his teeth at this.</p><br/><p>He had seen a creature like this before.</p><br/><p>Although it gave tremendous strength to its host, it gnawed on the life of its host and caused the host to go insane.</p><br/><p>After Melchizedek\u2019s control tower had disappeared, Enbi Arin\u2019s body was now just filled with a crazed rage.</p><br/><p>The only thing on its agenda was to beat its opponent.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhhh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin continued to scream and charged at him again.</p><br/><p>\u2014crunch!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014crack!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The ground fell apart with every step, shaking their surroundings.</p><br/><p>\u2014boooooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo and Enbi Arin\u2019s bodies collided once again.</p><br/><p>But it was a bit different this time around.</p><br/><p>\u2014crack!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The surface of the blue armor seemed to swirl around strangely.</p><br/><p>The liquid-like armor quickly made crackling noises as it turned crystalline.</p><br/><p>\u2014clang!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Mjolnir, which could push back Enbi Arin before, simply bounced off the armor.</p><br/><p>From the surface of the armor, which seemed to have evolved to counter Mjolnir.</p><br/><p>\u2014booooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Frowning, Hansoo activated his Demonic Dragon\u2019s Reinforcement to its limits in order to block Enbi Arin, who had begun to charge in during that small gap.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026Nelkipa?\u2019</p><br/><p>Before he could finish this train of thought\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014Enbi Arin charged in and smashed at his body.</p><br/><p>Although Enbi Arin\u2019s Reinforcement was a level below his, the armor surrounding her body was more than enough.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhup!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo dispersed the force as he flew back, groaning as he pondered.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Should I retreat for a bit and come back?\u2019</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin\u2019s status was definitely not normal.</p><br/><p>She was burning up her entire body\u2019s lifeforce to fight.</p><br/><p>If that armor was a type of lifeform, it would care about its host.</p><br/><p>If he disappeared, then it would return the host to its original status.</p><br/><p>But then\u2014 </p><br/><p>As if it liked Enbi Arin\u2019s current situation, it started to morph again.</p><br/><p>\u2014kuddduududuk!\u2014 </p><br/><p>To an even stronger form.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhhh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Screams of pain mixed with rage came out from Enbi Arin\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo frowned at this scene.</p><br/><p>\u2018It was more evil than I thought, huh?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo regretted comparing that armor to a parasite.</p><br/><p>That armor was more evil than any abyssal creature in existence.</p><br/><p>Since a parasite at least cared about the survival of the host.</p><br/><p>But that blue armor was different.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t care about the host\u2019s body at all.</p><br/><p>It only cared about how it could suck even more energy out from the host\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>There was nothing else he could do at this point.</p><br/><p>He had to suppress Enbi Arin.</p><br/><p>It wouldn\u2019t be easy, but he had to do it.</p><br/><p>\u2018Melchizedek\u2026 Where did he get such a thing?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014boom! boom! boom! boom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>As Hansoo grasped tightly onto the hammer, staring at Enbi Arin charging towards him again\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014kiiiiing!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014he felt a large amount of energy coming in from the distance.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014booooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>A beam appeared from the distance and slammed onto Enbi Arin who was charging towards him.</p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>After the unexpected long-range attack flung Enbi Arin away\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014something landed next to Hansoo.</p><br/><p>And Hansoo chuckled after realizing who the person wearing the mechanical armor was.</p><br/><p>Although they were in the middle of a battle, Kiriel\u2019s expression was indeed funny.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like it fits just fine, but what\u2019s with your expression?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiriel looked with dissatisfaction at the armor covering her body and spoke out with a frown.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh\u2026 It feels really dirty! It sticks onto your body!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiriel frowned as she saw the Dragon God Armor swirling around and latching onto her skin.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t seem to have any loyalty towards its previous owner as it instantly fell apart and attached itself onto her body the moment she touched it.</p><br/><p>As if it yearned for an even stronger body.</p><br/><p>She\u2019d freaked out when she saw the living parts of the armor inside it.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is there nothing normal in this world? Machine or lifeform, choose between the two!\u2019</p><br/><p>Kiriel had worried about whether the armor, which had been worn by a man, would fit her but it had reconstructed itself perfectly around her.</p><br/><p>She soon sighed and decided to focus on the battle.</p><br/><p>\u2014ssss\u2014 </p><br/><p>Enbi Arin stood up again.</p><br/><p>And it didn\u2019t seem like the beam attack would work a second time.</p><br/><p>\u2014squirm\u2014 </p><br/><p>The armor\u2019s surface was changing again.</p><br/><p>\u2018...That\u2019s a real monster there.\u2019</p><br/><p>Kiriel asked Hansoo:</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat should we do? Should we run?\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Enbi Arin\u2019s speed, it didn\u2019t seem like it would be easy to run away, but her aura was way too vicious to fight her currently.</p><br/><p>Hansoo shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ve figured it out thanks to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Kiriel made a confused expression\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014boooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014Enbi Arin stomped down onto the ground and flew towards Hansoo.</p><br/><p>At a tremendous speed.</p><br/><p>\u2014whoooosh!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2018This\u2026! Too fast!\u2019</p><br/><p>Looking at it from a distance and looking at it up close was extremely different.</p><br/><p>\u201cDodge it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiriel prepared for impact as the now horrifying-looking armor closed in on them, but then a strange sound rang out next to her.</p><br/><p>\u2014tonk!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2018...Huh?\u2019</p><br/><p>Kiriel freaked out after turning her head.</p><br/><p>Hansoo had thrown away his hammer.</p><br/><p>But even before Kiriel could think of the next step in his plan.</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin had already jumped onto Hansoo.</p><br/><p>And smashed Kiriel away as well.</p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u201cHuep!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiriel quickly repositioned herself after the attack flung her away, only to be left speechless at the current scene before her eyes.</p><br/><p>The scene of Hansoo and the monster-like armor grasping each other\u2019s hands and having a power struggle.</p><br/><p>\u2014kuduk!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014kududuk!\u2014 </p><br/><p>It was so strong that Hansoo\u2019s arm was making strange noises as it trembled.</p><br/><p>\u2018What\u2026?\u2019</p><br/><p>As Kiriel was about to charge in and help\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014Hansoo whispered something amidst the power struggle, his expression unreadable.</p><br/><p>Something to his opponent in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome\u2026to me. Isn\u2019t it time to switch owners?\u201d</p><br/><p>Words towards the armor and not Enbi Arin.</p><br/><p>\u2014squirm\u2014 </p><br/><p>A part of the armor squirmed around as if it comprehended Hansoo\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u2014pushook!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014pushkshkshk!\u2014 </p><br/><p>A few of the spines came out from Enbi Arin\u2019s body and pierced Hansoo, then started to suck Hansoo\u2019s energy out.</p><br/><p>As if it were testing the waters.</p><br/><p>And the moment Hansoo\u2019s energy flowed into the armor.</p><br/><p>\u2014tremble\u2014 </p><br/><p>The entire set of armor started to shake.</p><br/><p> A tremendous life force.</p><br/><p>The extreme amount of potential hidden inside this body.</p><br/><p>The blue armor realized instinctively as it tasted the tremendous amount of life force flowing into its body.</p><br/><p>That this was the real deal.</p><br/><p>The \u2018transcendent being\u2019 it had been attracted to was just an imitation of the real deal.</p><br/><p>The original was always better than the fake and had more worth.</p><br/><p>And soon, a change occurred.</p><br/><p>\u2014squirm\u2014 </p><br/><p>The armor quickly changed its form after scanning Hansoo\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>From hard armor to a liquid-like form.</p><br/><p>And soon\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014ssssss\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014the blue liquid swirled around madly as it quickly covered Hansoo\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Good boy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo chuckled coldly at the scene of the blue liquid instinctively moving onto a stronger host and was now covering his face.</p><br/><p>He then looked worriedly over at Enbi Arin, whose face could now be seen.</p><br/><p>\u2018You can rest now. I\u2019m sorry for being late.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014kwaduk!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The blue armor made a strange noise and started to condense onto Hansoo\u2019s body.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

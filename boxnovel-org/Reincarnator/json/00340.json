I was able to hide from the Ark-Roa, and even from the one who created the various Transcendents.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s brows rose up.</p><br/><p>He had always wondered how she\u2019d roamed around without being detected by the others, but it looked like this was how she had done it.</p><br/><p>\u2018It still shouldn\u2019t have been that easy.\u2019</p><br/><p>Her methods were indeed above the norm, and her talents were naturally not inferior to the Keldian in the past.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyway, where do we go now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiriel asked Hansoo, looking around the vast, artificial land.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s too wide.\u2019</p><br/><p>If she were to read everything with her Psychometry, she would burn out very quickly.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t know what she had to look for as well.</p><br/><p>\u2018Right\u2026 Do I have to tell her?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo thought to himself.</p><br/><p>If they were going to continue traveling, there was a need for him to tell her that he had come from the future.</p><br/><p>Otherwise, she would question him every time he did something strange.</p><br/><p>It might even cause confusion during a decisive moment.</p><br/><p>Since Kiriel wouldn\u2019t understand why he was doing certain things.</p><br/><p>But even before Hansoo could finish his thoughts, Kiriel asked him a question, with eyes full of expectation.</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry and show me. I heard you have a weird superpower right?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201c...\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Did she see that too?\u2019</p><br/><p>He had heard that she\u2019d researched him, but it looked like she\u2019d also seen the lies he\u2019d made in the past.</p><br/><p>Hansoo chuckled at Kiriel\u2019s puppy-like eyes and pointed towards a direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go that way then.\u201d</p><br/><p>And Kiriel smiled at Hansoo\u2019s actions.</p><br/><p>This world was a new, unknown world.</p><br/><p>Nobody knew where they were, and they didn\u2019t know what they would encounter or where they had to go.</p><br/><p>But a trait that showed them the path in a situation like this?</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t that the best trait in a leader one could ask for?</p><br/><p>And his goal was cool too.</p><br/><p>Saving all of mankind.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m going to follow him until the end!\u2019</p><br/><p>Kiriel tightly grasped the fang in her hand as she quickly followed Hansoo from behind.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems everything was destroyed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Who lived here in the past?\u2019</p><br/><p>Kiriel mumbled as she ran past countless metal buildings.</p><br/><p>It was strange.</p><br/><p>Robots wouldn\u2019t live in such places.</p><br/><p>And the half-destroyed barrier in the sky had also proved something.</p><br/><p>There was something that needed that exact barrier.</p><br/><p>But strangely, there wasn\u2019t a single trace of a human being in this vast land.</p><br/><p>Only the metal robots that roamed from place to place while making strange noises.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ugh.\u2019</p><br/><p>Kiriel looked around at the tank-like robots, who all seemed to be running around in a hectic state because of their intrusion.</p><br/><p>\u2014sssssk!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2018What the hell?\u2019</p><br/><p>Kiriel frowned at the minute and invisible wave that made contact with her own barrier.</p><br/><p>This was a detection skill.</p><br/><p>Quite a high-leveled one too.</p><br/><p>\u2018No, it\u2019s not just a skill. What is this?\u2019</p><br/><p>One thing was clear at least; they had been found.</p><br/><p>\u2014swoosh\u2014 </p><br/><p>A man appeared from where the wave had originated from in the distance.</p><br/><p>Right where they were heading towards.</p><br/><p>And the man was holding onto a strange rod-like object in his hands.</p><br/><p>\u2014chiiijijik\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2018That. He mixed his skill with that.\u2019</p><br/><p>She wondered how he\u2019d detected her through her barrier, but he\u2019d apparently mixed his skill with a strange object.</p><br/><p>The man wore a necklace, which suddenly created a strange, translucent bubble that surrounded his head.</p><br/><p>Something that allowed him to maintain his fighting abilities in a land that had no oxygen to breathe.</p><br/><p>Kiriel started to get curious as she watched the man. He seemed to be clad in various items that looked different from normal artifacts.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Were you always able to mix skills with technology?\u2019</p><br/><p>That thing looked extremely useful.</p><br/><p>Though the skills looked magical, they were a lot of cases where they fell short.</p><br/><p>Most of them were very inefficient if they couldn\u2019t be used in direct combat or for survival.</p><br/><p>And as if feeling Kiriel\u2019s eyes on him, the man shouted out towards Kiriel and Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait! Please wait a moment!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiriel stopped after hearing the man\u2019s shout, and asked Hansoo: </p><br/><p>\u201cWhat shall we do?\u201d</p><br/><p>She was interested in the man already, but the man had come to find them instead.</p><br/><p>And the man was in quite a perilous situation as well.</p><br/><p>\u2014Kirrrrk!\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cDamnit!\u201d</p><br/><p>The surrounding robots had heard the man\u2019s shouts and were gathering towards this area.</p><br/><p>Apparently, he had come outside even after knowing that it would be dangerous.</p><br/><p>Hansoo pondered for a moment at Kiriel\u2019s words, but then nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hear him out at least.\u201d</p><br/><p>The scene from the memory Kiriel had told him about kept on bugging him.</p><br/><p>And he also wondered why the giant barrier in the sky had broken apart.</p><br/><p>Intel was better the more one had, and somebody who\u2019d been here longer would definitely know more than they did.</p><br/><p>Kiriel chuckled as she nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like we\u2019ll need to rescue him first.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man was screaming while he fought the robots in the distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>She and Hansoo couldn\u2019t be seen by the robots since they were behind her barrier that hid them.</p><br/><p>So all their attention and attacks had been focused on the man.</p><br/><p>Hansoo nodded at Kiriel\u2019s words as he watched the man who was barely dodging the various attacks that flew towards him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014ssssss\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014a mass of red clouds started to appear around Hansoo\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaa\u2026 haaa. Thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man gasped for breath after reaching the barrier Kiriel had set up.</p><br/><p>Kiriel mumbled to herself as she looked at the man\u2019s appearance.</p><br/><p>\u2018Woah. What a hottie!\u2019</p><br/><p>His looks were comparable to some famous superstar.</p><br/><p>But Kiriel moved her eyes away from his face.</p><br/><p>The various machinery the man had on his body was more interesting to her than his face.</p><br/><p>\u2018What are all these things?\u2019</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t an engineer to begin with, so she couldn\u2019t figure out with a single glance how he used his machinery nor how they were created.</p><br/><p>But there was no need for her to know all those details.</p><br/><p>She just needed to know how to use them, and what effect they had.</p><br/><p>And her trait was perfect for such a thing.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s see.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014kiiiiing\u2014 </p><br/><p>As Kiriel activated her Psychometry to read the memories\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014Hansoo spoke to the man, who was still gasping for breath.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you call out to us?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man looked into Hansoo\u2019s eyes and said:</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat else? I was asking for help.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiriel clenched her teeth as she used a touch of her Psychometry.</p><br/><p>She had expected this to some degree.</p><br/><p>Since she and Hansoo had shown off their prowess already, anyone who came to find them would be coming for that exact reason.</p><br/><p>But what gall.[a][b]</p><br/><p>\u2018Is he not scared?\u2019</p><br/><p>Those looks might be able to subdue the rage of some females, but it wouldn\u2019t be that useful against another man.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo looked at the man in amusement.</p><br/><p>He could see the man had something backing his arrogance.</p><br/><p>And the man saw Hansoo\u2019s gaze and nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. We should all be helping each other out. I\u2019m sure you won\u2019t lose out on this deal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you even know who we are?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man shrugged his shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know who you are, but you are human. Since that crazy bastard Melchizedek betrayed the humans, we should be helping each other out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBetray?\u2019</p><br/><p>Kiriel was shocked.</p><br/><p>Betrayal?</p><br/><p>Had they been allies in the past?</p><br/><p>The man looked at Kiriel in shock.</p><br/><p>\u2018What a pretty girl.\u2019</p><br/><p>The man, Jack Hounder, smiled and replied kindly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, betray. That bastard suggested we ally and then betrayed us the moment we agreed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jack looked in the direction of the research center in the distance.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>Outer areas of the giant machine city.</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014 </p><br/><p>A train-like object was quickly scouting through the perimeter of the city.</p><br/><p>But it didn\u2019t seem like a train for transferring people or cargo.</p><br/><p>The giant train racing through the metal ground was simply humongous.</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014 </p><br/><p>The giant train charging over the ground was easily the size of a small island.</p><br/><p>And there were hundreds of buildings that had been built on top of that train.</p><br/><p>And in the middle of this train\u2026 </p><br/><p>Within a giant building\u2026 </p><br/><p>\u2014rummble\u2014 </p><br/><p>A two-meter-tall humanoid form was standing in the middle of a structure, which resembled a factory or research center.</p><br/><p>The man, who had been standing amidst the countless noisy machines, ignored the faint vibrations in the ground as he looked around.</p><br/><p>Though the various machines looked quite disorganized\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014the view from the man\u2019s position was quite a sight.</p><br/><p>To the left, there were thousands of test tubes which held countless humans.</p><br/><p>To the right of the man, there were factories that were quickly constructing things.</p><br/><p>\u2014bubble bubble\u2014 </p><br/><p>The humans who looked to be sleeping peacefully were mostly in parts.</p><br/><p>Just the bottom half, the top half or just the arms and legs.</p><br/><p>The other parts had already melted down into the liquid.</p><br/><p>And these liquified bodies were being sucked into a larger tube that was attached on top of the test tubes.</p><br/><p>\u2014sssss\u2014 </p><br/><p>The man, who had been staring at the factory, turned towards the liquids.</p><br/><p>Towards the direction where those liquids were heading to.</p><br/><p>The man looked at the giant aquarium located in front of him.</p><br/><p>The lifeform that was being created in the middle.</p><br/><p>The lifeform that was receiving the liquefied humans from the left, and nanomachines from the plant on the right.</p><br/><p>The man caressed the aquarium as he mumbled.</p><br/><p>\u2018A step towards\u2026 unification.\u2019</p><br/><p>But this was not enough.</p><br/><p>He needed more.</p><br/><p>As fast as possible.</p><br/><p>As much as possible.</p><br/><p>The man then turned towards the elevator and smiled.</p><br/><p>[a]? like seagulls or gall, like he has such balls</p><br/><p>[b]he has le balls</p><br/>\n</div>"}

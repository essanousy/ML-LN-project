I guess it isn\u2019t enough anymore.\u2019</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just the Forked Lightning that had been wrecked.</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked at the half-destroyed Thousand Soldiers Armor, then shrugged.</p><br/><p>When he\u2019d woken up, his Nurmaha\u2019s ring was long gone, and the two usable artifacts he\u2019d had left were at the point of breaking apart.</p><br/><p>Hansoo chuckled at what a miserable sight he made.</p><br/><p>Well, it made a lot of sense.</p><br/><p>Solo Numbering artifacts meant that they were the best artifacts of the seven zones.</p><br/><p>Though they were top-notch artifacts that had saved his life countless times, ever since the seven zones had collapsed and people started crossing the barrier, these weapons just couldn\u2019t keep up with the changes.</p><br/><p>He needed better artifacts.</p><br/><p>But the issue was that, as of right now, there was nowhere for him to gain any.</p><br/><p>\u2018It would\u2019ve been nice if I still had the Nurmaha.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo muttered, thinking of the ring which had mysteriously disappeared.</p><br/><p>Though it was in the lower ranks of the Solo Numbering, it was still a very powerful artifact.</p><br/><p>Being ranked ninth, it was actually more useful than the sixth ranked Thousand Soldiers Armor, and even the Forked Lightning.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, how I obtained it was abnormal as well\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>He felt like there was something he didn\u2019t know about, but there was no point in grieving over it since it was already gone.</p><br/><p>No matter how good it was, if it wasn\u2019t in his hands then it was even more useless than this broken-down spear.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026I knew this would happen to you eventually whenever you were bent like that in the past.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked at the spear and sighed out loud.</p><br/><p>He then applied some force and broke it apart.</p><br/><p>\u2014snap\u2014 </p><br/><p>Despite him being a transcendent, it shouldn\u2019t be a weapon that could break this easily, but it had still done so way too effortlessly.</p><br/><p>It had already reached its limits.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019ve done well so far. Please\u2026 hold on for just a bit longer.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo held onto the half with the blade, and fed the bottom half to his armor.</p><br/><p>\u2014crunch crunch\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014crunch\u2014 </p><br/><p>A mouth appeared on the chest of the armor, and it started to devour the halved Forked Lightning.</p><br/><p>Soon, the silver armor started to repair itself, with bits of gold appearing to fill in the cracks.</p><br/><p>\u2018This should be good enough.\u2019</p><br/><p>Though the range of his attacks had been considerably reduced, there was no point in using a spear that was already cracked in the middle since he wouldn\u2019t be able to fully utilize its strength.</p><br/><p>It was better to use it as a short spear and feed the rest to reinforce his armor.</p><br/><p>But the Thousand Soldiers Armor was not the only thing that had finished its meal.</p><br/><p>\u2014crunch\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u201cKeke.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Ark-Roa smiled after having finished eating Hansoo\u2019s left arm.</p><br/><p>And soon\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014boooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014the Ark-Roa roared and charged at Hansoo.</p><br/><p>Towards Kiriel, who was behind Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u2018What a smart kid.\u2019</p><br/><p>As Hansoo moved into a defensive position to block the Ark-Roa\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014kwaddduduk!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014another arm extended out from its chest and smashed into Hansoo\u2019s spear.</p><br/><p>Usually, he would just block something like this.</p><br/><p>But then the Ark-Roa\u2019s left hand would kill Kiriel.</p><br/><p>\u2014crunch!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo felt his chest being destroyed, and thought of Kiriel behind him.</p><br/><p>If he gave her up, it would be a much easier battle.</p><br/><p>And that made sense as well.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know what Kiriel would bring, but the current situation wasn\u2019t very optimistic.</p><br/><p>But he decided to just follow his heart.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ugh, just treat it as a form of repayment.

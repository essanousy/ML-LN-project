They really did it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know something?\u201d</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin nodded.</p><br/><p>She had climbed up here and had fought countless battles over multiple floors.</p><br/><p>She had been here.</p><br/><p>She had seen the crystal below.</p><br/><p>She was just surprised because it was her first time seeing the blue armor and the corpses. She had also found out that the crystal existed in Aokan as well.</p><br/><p>The main crystal that controlled the movements of Nelkipa and controlled the flow of energy.</p><br/><p>The two sub-crystals that controlled the subsystems and soldiers in Nelkipa.</p><br/><p>One would only have complete control over Nelkipa if they had all three of these crystals.</p><br/><p>\u2018It seems they divided it between themselves. Even if they\u2019re dislikable, this isn\u2019t bad.\u2019</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin clenched her teeth as she felt the three distinct auras around them.</p><br/><p>If the Valentine siblings\u2014Clementine\u2019s underlings\u2014or Melchizedek had complete control over Nelkipa, then this giant ray wouldn't be flying around in such a calm manner.</p><br/><p>It was lucky for them.</p><br/><p>But the situation still wasn't that great.</p><br/><p>The two sides seemed to have taken extreme measures to reach a conclusion.</p><br/><p>\u201c...Do you know what their plans are?\u201d</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin nodded at Kiriel\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know about one, but not the other.\u201d</p><br/><p>She knew what the Valentine siblings had chosen.</p><br/><p>Self-destruction.</p><br/><p>\u2018They probably decided that gaining control over the Nelkipa was a bit too much.\u2019</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin gritted her teeth.</p><br/><p>If they succeeded in destroying the crystals, this place would become a sea of flames.</p><br/><p>The worse case scenario would be the death of this giant creature.</p><br/><p>The people arriving after them wouldn\u2019t even have a single plot of land they could step on before being killed.</p><br/><p>Even if this giant creature didn\u2019t die, those people would die from Angkara\u2019s attacks.</p><br/><p>They had to take control of Nelkipa before it died and then take it far away from Angkara.</p><br/><p>\u2018In the end, we have to deal with all three places.\u2019</p><br/><p>The issue was Melchizedek; she didn\u2019t know what that thing was planning.</p><br/><p>This was probably the reason why the twins had started up the self-destruction sequences as well.</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t charge in, and they didn\u2019t know what Melchizedek was planning.</p><br/><p>It would\u2019ve been nice if they could charge in there, sweep everything clean and then go up.</p><br/><p>\u2018The best situation would be to deal with them one at a time.\u2019</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin thought to herself.</p><br/><p>Looking at it, Melchizedek and the siblings were all separated.</p><br/><p>It would be best if the three of them dealt with Melchizedek and the twins one at a time.</p><br/><p>But of course, there wasn\u2019t enough time.</p><br/><p>Even if they got to Melchizedek, it would have no meaning if one of the siblings succeeded. But it was too much of a risk to leave Melchizedek alone.</p><br/><p>\u2018...That thing wouldn\u2019t plan something useless.\u2019</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin asked Hansoo:</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat shall we do?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo, in his blue armor, spoke with a heavy expression.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2018Mmm\u2026 This is quite exhausting.\u2019</p><br/><p>Elis Valentine made a tired expression as she held onto the crystal.</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t really doing much.</p><br/><p>She was just stimulating the energy within the crystal to make it go haywire.</p><br/><p>But because of the energy within it, it was hard work.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tsk. We can\u2019t do anything.\u2019</p><br/><p>Elis looked at the spike by her waist that she\u2019d used to stab her skin before.</p><br/><p>Stabbing herself with the spike was the best thing to do when things got boring, but she had to hold herself back.</p><br/><p>She had to finish this up quickly and then go up.</p><br/><p>In a situation like this where they didn\u2019t know what Melchizedek was planning, the easier they dealt with it, the better.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s just finish this up fast and go up. I\u2019ll ask for a holiday after I go up.\u2019</p><br/><p>Others wouldn\u2019t know about what went on above, but she and Ares Valentine had the Soul Fragments, so they knew a few things.</p><br/><p>According to what they heard, the two people in the Indigo Zone above were having the time of their lives.</p><br/><p>They had performed well to a certain degree up until now, but hard work deserves a short holiday, right?</p><br/><p>As Elis Valentine thought of climbing up and leisurely eating crystals and playing around\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014chiiiiiik\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014she felt a faint aura in the distance.</p><br/><p>It was a bit too far for her to feel in detail, but that aura was sharp beyond reason.</p><br/><p>And as she felt this...</p><br/><p>Elis Valentine was shocked.</p><br/><p>\u2018...3-Star? There are 3-Stars?\u2019</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t ignore that aura.</p><br/><p>It was a similar aura to hers.</p><br/><p>\u2018...There are still people who can become 3-Stars?\u2019</p><br/><p>Elis Valentine was truly shocked.</p><br/><p>They had taken everyone with the slightest bit of potential and recruited them to their side. All the others had been turned into artificial Transcendents by Melchizedek.</p><br/><p>She\u2019d never thought that someone else would be able to rise to the level of a 3-Star Transcendent.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is it him?\u2019</p><br/><p>She had heard about it before from Taehee, the owner of the Soul Fragments.</p><br/><p>That the man called Kang Hansoo had risen up to become a Transcendent, so be careful and deal with him quickly if possible.</p><br/><p>Of course, Taehee chuckled at this too.</p><br/><p>A man who had become a 1-Star in the Green Zone below.</p><br/><p>He had somehow managed to deal with a brat who was Jang Oh\u2019s successor and had risen to a 2-Star, but that wasn\u2019t much for them to worry about.</p><br/><p>The difference between a 2-Star and a 3-Star was actually tremendous.</p><br/><p>If they were truly wary of him, then they would\u2019ve long gone down and dealt with him while in the middle of their fight against Melchizedek.</p><br/><p>They wouldn\u2019t want to overlook an unknown variable in such a tense situation.</p><br/><p>But of course, they hadn\u2019t gone down.</p><br/><p>They\u2019d only focused on Melchizedek before them.</p><br/><p>It was for one reason.</p><br/><p>He was weak.</p><br/><p>Someone who\u2019d recently risen to a 2-Star level could not rise to become a 3-Star Transcendent in such a short time.</p><br/><p>Even if he did rise, he would be much weaker than them.</p><br/><p>But this aura was truly overbearing.</p><br/><p>\u2018I see. You\u2019ve arrived.\u2019</p><br/><p>She had been shocked.</p><br/><p>At how he\u2019d actually risen up to the level of a 3-Star Transcendent.</p><br/><p>He really lived up to being the person who\u2019d wrecked apart the lower floors.</p><br/><p>But that was it.</p><br/><p>Elis Valentine realized that defending her position was the right choice instead of going down and dealing with him.</p><br/><p>She realized that there was no point in showing her back to Melchizedek just to deal with Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u2018Come.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014chwaaaaak!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Elis Valentine stopped pouring energy into the crystal and grasped the 50-cm-long spike by her waist.</p><br/><p>\u2014tremble\u2014 </p><br/><p>Elis Valentine couldn\u2019t prevent her own cravings after holding onto the spike and started to stab herself again.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ahhh\u2026.\u2019</p><br/><p>At first, she started on her arm, a location which wouldn\u2019t cause much trouble in a fight.</p><br/><p>But the location of the stabs started slowly rising up.</p><br/><p>Towards her heart.</p><br/><p>\u2014pushuk\u2014pushuk\u2014 </p><br/><p>As the stabs slowly approached her heart, the previous wounds healed.</p><br/><p>\u2014tatatak!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The owner of that aura had already appeared before her eyes.</p><br/><p>And as he appeared\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u201c...?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014Elis put the spike away, stopping short of stabbing it into her heart, and frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201c...I didn\u2019t know that Kang Hansoo was a female. Did you have plastic surgery or something?\u201d</p><br/><p>The woman who had flown across the air, Kiriel, smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cHansoo is a bit too busy to deal with trash like you, so as his fan, I\u2019ve come in his stead. As a fan, it\u2019s my duty to let him focus on his duties, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elis frowned as she spat out a reply.</p><br/><p>\u201c...Not bad. So you\u2019re one of his slaves, huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>The compliment was not directed to Kiriel, but to Hansoo.</p><br/><p>Kiriel giggled as she replied:</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean a slave? I\u2019m just a fan. It seems you have some issues with your mouth. Or maybe your ears.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although she was smiling, the bloodthirsty aura that was radiating from her body kept rising.</p><br/><p>An extremely tense situation.</p><br/><p>Elis Valentine chuckled as she looked at Kiriel and the Dragon God Armor.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have a fun toy equipped. Anyway\u2026 doesn\u2019t he care about his own fans? To let them die in a place like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiriel looked at Elis who had spoken with a smile and replied with a smile as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll be the one getting f***ed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWoah. Language. Anyway\u2026 are you sure you should be here? What about my brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiriel shrugged her shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone else went there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiriel said, pointing towards the other crystal in the far distance.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201cWoah. It\u2019s been a while. Have you been well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin clenched her fists at Ares Valentine's words.</p><br/><p>\u201cYup. I\u2019ve slept very well, thanks to some bastards.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha! It seems you had a good dream. Was it about me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin frowned at Ares\u2019s sleek words which resembled something a lover would say and then said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThe issue was that you appeared a bit too much. A real nightmare.\u201d</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin glared at Ares and spat out:</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 you were my husband.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my. Melchizedek really did put in some effort. He fulfilled one of my small wishes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ares Valentine chuckled at the word \u2018husband\u2019.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

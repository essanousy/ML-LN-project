I\u2019ll...Take it from here.\u201d</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t know what he was going to do.</p><br/><p>But the moment she heard those words.</p><br/><p>Her entire body trembled.</p><br/><p>And even before she could react.</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s left hand moved.</p><br/><p>A simple gesture.</p><br/><p>A light movement that seemed like it was shaking off some water from his hands but the effect of such a movement was not that light.</p><br/><p>The moment the tip of his fingers moved within the smoke.</p><br/><p>Boooooooom!</p><br/><p>A tremendous sound created by an explosion rang throughout the area.</p><br/><p>A force that should be associated to just a simple movement of one\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment the Gold and Scarlet Demons shouted out in shock.</p><br/><p>Whooooosh!</p><br/><p>Something flew through the smoke.</p><br/><p>Towards Sharon Stiller and the other players who were standing in a daze.</p><br/><p>The speed and the force behind it.</p><br/><p>All the hairs on Sharon Stiller\u2019s body rose up.</p><br/><p>\u2018I have to block\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Sharon Stiller instinctively tried to raise the weapon which had the Spirit Stone embedded in it.</p><br/><p>In order to block the object flying towards her.</p><br/><p>The weapon which had a spirit stone embedded in it was many more times more durable than other weapons.</p><br/><p>Logically it should be able to block an attack created by some slight hand movements.</p><br/><p>But Sharon Stiller suppressed her instincts and instead performed another action.</p><br/><p>\u2018No! I must dodge it!\u2019</p><br/><p>Boooooom!</p><br/><p>From the might of the object flying towards her, it was clear what she should do.</p><br/><p>That was not something she could block.</p><br/><p>Sharon Stiller\u2019s entire body quickly reacted and started to shrink.</p><br/><p>And thanks to her body which had been tempered through all sorts of experiences, she had been able to react to it.</p><br/><p>Sharon Stiller\u2019s body moved outside of the trajectory of the object flying towards the Scarlet Demons.</p><br/><p>Towards a location where she would just barely be hit.</p><br/><p>\u2018Good. Then the main target wouldn\u2019t be\u2026.\u2019</p><br/><p>As Sharon Stiller sighed in relief.</p><br/><p>Whooooosh!</p><br/><p>The red object made a sharp turn and curved like a snake.</p><br/><p>At an angle that was impossible with its speed and mass.</p><br/><p>\u2018What the fuck!!\u2019</p><br/><p>A meteor being able to turn at that angle would look more realistic than this.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sharon Stiller tried to scream out at the object that turned at an unreal angle and towards her but that was all she could do.</p><br/><p>Boooooom!</p><br/><p>Her head and the piece of metal collided and created a large explosive sound.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>The meteor-like metal object pierced her head and turned her into gold powder.</p><br/><p>It then pierced numerous tens of people behind her.</p><br/><p>Whooosh!</p><br/><p>Crunch!</p><br/><p>Ududududuk!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUaaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFucking he\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Some tried to dodge and some tried to block.</p><br/><p>The Scarlet and Gold Demons were all prepared for it in their own ways but it was all useless.</p><br/><p>The ones who tried to block had their bodies blown apart and the ones who tried to dodge had their heads pierced by the snake-like metal object.</p><br/><p>In a short moment that was less than a second, numerous tens of people disappeared into golden light.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell! This is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat! What is this!\u201d</p><br/><p>The comrades standing next to them had disappeared into golden light after a single blink.</p><br/><p>They were holding on because it was just a game, if this was reality then they would\u2019ve all pissed their pants.</p><br/><p>As people made dumbfounded expressions at this unreal scene.</p><br/><p>The flail, which had pierced through multiple dozens of people, returned back to Hansoo\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As Hansoo made a discontent expression while looking at the flail in his hand.</p><br/><p>Akun, the leader of the souls, mumbled in his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a missing sentence before this to the players but they soon figured out what Hansoo meant.</p><br/><p>Since Hansoo himself spoke it out loud.</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019ll have to smash with it directly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Hansoo tightly held onto the handle of the flail with his left hand.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Whoooooosh!</p><br/><p>Hansoo\u2019s body flew into the air along with a loud noise.</p><br/><p>Towards the Gold and Scarlet Demons in the distance who were cursing.</p><br/><p>Then his body fell towards the center of all the players.</p><br/><p>And the players were shocked at this scene.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis guy, is he looking down on us this much\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe must be crazy.\u201d</p><br/><p>The attack being powerful and the attack either working or not were two different things.</p><br/><p>The thing they were most worried about was him running around while that weapon destroyed them.</p><br/><p>They could catch up to him in term of speeds at least, but his weapon could not be tracked even with their eyes.</p><br/><p>This was why they even had thoughts of ignoring him and going for the bug players in the back.</p><br/><p>So they could at least get some experience while running around.</p><br/><p>But for him to directly jump in.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t have to fear that weapon if they killed him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well. That\u2019s not the end.\u2019</p><br/><p>One of the Scarlet Demons made a greedy expression.</p><br/><p>What if he got that weapon?</p><br/><p>Top ranker.</p><br/><p>What a wonderful title.</p><br/><p>Even among the countless players, only 100 people in total had the rights to this title.</p><br/><p>If he had that weapon, he might be able to become a top ranker.</p><br/><p>A top ranker who was even more famous than a president and even had more fans than celebrities in the real world.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yeah. There\u2019s no owner to an item. There are no weapons I cannot use, I\u2019m already at the max level.\u2019</p><br/><p>And as if he wasn\u2019t the only one who thought of this, the countless Gold and Scarlet Demons who were thinking about going for the bug players were now heading towards the location where Hansoo would land.</p><br/><p>\u2018Dumbasses. At least some need to attack him to disperse his attention.\u2019</p><br/><p>As a few Scarlet Demons were about to scream towards the Gold Demons.</p><br/><p>\u201cDropping your guard?\u201d</p><br/><p>Whooosh!</p><br/><p>Hansoo mumbled as he dropped and created a red arc by swinging his arm.</p><br/><p>An arc which swung through the head of the Scarlet Demon next to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cKill him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFearless bastard!\u201d</p><br/><p>Countless Gold and Scarlet Demons were charging towards him.</p><br/><p>With their best attacking skills.</p><br/><p>They knew about the strength behind his attacks.</p><br/><p>It would just be better to have trades because of that power.</p><br/><p>Which means they didn\u2019t have to worry about defending, since they couldn\u2019t, or about their mana since all they had was a single shot.</p><br/><p>They only had to attack.</p><br/><p>With their most powerful attack.</p><br/><p>Whooosh!</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>Kuuuguguguung!</p><br/><p>Numerous differently colored lights and shadows exploded out from the hands of the Scarlet and Gold Demons.</p><br/><p>A might that terrified the adventurers watching.</p><br/><p>High level skills which could easily shred them apart.</p><br/><p>And multiple dozens of these flew towards Hansoo.</p><br/><p>Towards Hansoo\u2019s scorching red body which had a similar color as a metal that had been heated up in a forge.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Booooom!</p><br/><p>Kwaaagagagang!</p><br/><p>\u201cYosh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDirect hit!\u201d</p><br/><p>Though some had been dodged and some had been blocked, most of them hit him directly.</p><br/><p>And the Scarlet Demon\u2019s expressions were even better.</p><br/><p>As they had fought before, they knew that this guy wasn\u2019t an immortal like them.</p><br/><p>Which meant that damage of this level would be effective.</p><br/><p>But sadly, their expectations and hope had been shattered.</p><br/><p>Whoooosh!</p><br/><p>Through the loud noises and smoke, a streak red light leaked through.</p><br/><p>A red light that was different from their attack skills.</p><br/><p>And a humanoid form walked through that smoke.</p><br/><p>Without any traces of damage on his body.</p><br/><p>And the red light that was shining out from Hansoo\u2019s body seemed as if it wanted to explode.</p><br/><p>If the light up until now was that of a heated metal, the light that was being emitted now resembled a rising sun.</p><br/><p>And all of the Gold and Scarlet Demons were in a daze.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...Come on, this is too much. Even if it\u2019s a hack.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even if it was a hack, there should be some manners between gamers.</p><br/><p>As the people lost their words.</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked at the red light that was slowly fading away.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust this much huh.\u201d</p><br/><p>A line delivered by a certain voice could be heard inside his head.</p><br/><p>Hansoo thought about the remaining number in his head.</p><br/><p>\u2018No need to use it.\u2019</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Whooooosh!</p><br/><p>As if it the warm up had ended, Hansoo\u2019s hands started to fly through the air crazily.</p><br/><p>Forked Lightning in his right hand.</p><br/><p>And God\u2019s Flail in his left.</p><br/><p>And with this.</p><br/><p>Booom!</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>Kuududuk!</p><br/><p>\u201cWaaaak! This bastard!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRun away!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are you going you bastards!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUwaaaak! Fucking bug players! Let us go!\u201d</p><br/><p>Plenty of different collisions and sounds of explosions rang throughout the entire area.</p><br/><p>Along with the rage-filled yells and the players\u2019 screams.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Korin Kingdom\u2019s fortress which faced the War Fortress in the Keil Kingdom.</p><br/><p>A man stood on a tall mountain nearby.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha. How nice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018For that tiny spirit bomb to have this much of an effect. What an amazing benefit.\u2019</p><br/><p>The man, who had a hand over his eye and was watching the Great Maze, laughed heartily.</p><br/><p>Well, he was actually looking at the frowning expression of Arthus Krancheska due to the seal starting to break apart.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s nothing better than his work progressing well and annoying somebody he did not like.</p><br/><p>Though everyone inside that maze would face the rage of Arthus Krancheska.</p><br/><p>\u2018One of the three godly treasures of the empires huh. What a nice title.\u2019</p><br/><p>An artifact from before the time of extinction.</p><br/><p>Once the ancient artifact, God\u2019s Flail, got ripped apart, the hidden race would wake up.</p><br/><p>And the stopped world would soon start to flow again.</p><br/><p>The kingdoms, empires, Ains and even the players.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s rolling. It\u2019s finally rolling.\u2019</p><br/><p>As he thought up to this point.</p><br/><p>The smiling man\u2019s expression died out.</p><br/><p>\u2018I need to prepare properly.\u2019</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Oooooong.</p><br/><p>From the surrounding shadows, dark energy started to flow out.</p><br/><p>Towards the man\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>And then the man\u2019s body, which had now been shrouded in a large amount of darkness, disappeared.</p><br/><p>Leaving behind the scenery of the War Fortress in the distance.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

You probably came with your underlings anyway. And what are you going to do with your trait if not for this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gyesoo shrugged his shoulders at those words.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well. It\u2019s normal for her to not tell me.\u2019</p><br/><p>She was probably suspicious of what he was going to do.</p><br/><p>And how delightful was Hansoo for Camille.</p><br/><p>She had finally met someone who was going to be with her after so long.</p><br/><p>She was pretending to be astute on the outside but she was probably rather excited on the inside.</p><br/><p>Since Camille\u2019s actions which he had seen for the past 3 years were pitiful and lonely.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tsk. That\u2019s a shame. If she told me then we can save some time finding him.\u2019</p><br/><p>Gyesoo shook his head.</p><br/><p>He had come here with two objectives.</p><br/><p>One was the tourism business.</p><br/><p>The other was scouting.</p><br/><p>He had been preparing the tourism business because the reaction was better than he expected.</p><br/><p>He could find him quickly if he searched but everyone whom he had brought were preparing the tourism business so an empty gap would be created if he took someone out.</p><br/><p>Scouting was something he was preparing here and there while doing his tourism business, why would he waste manpower in that?</p><br/><p>\u2018There\u2019s no other way. I guess I\u2019ll run around a bit.\u2019</p><br/><p>His speciality, , allowed one to find the traces linking one person to another.</p><br/><p>He had been able to find Camille because of this and will be able to find Hansoo as well.</p><br/><p>It will take some time but it won\u2019t be hard.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then. I shall take a stroll around a bit then. I\u2019ll see you later. I hope you succeed this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gyesoo, who had wished her luck when he basically knew that she would fail, disappeared.</p><br/><p>Camille then looked towards the direction Hansoo had disappeared to and pondered.</p><br/><p>\u2018Should I tell this to Hansoo?\u2019</p><br/><p>Gyesoo was a 3rd year just like her but stronger than her.</p><br/><p>Since he had focused on getting strong unlike her and even had artifacts.</p><br/><p>And the number of underlings wouldn\u2019t be small either.</p><br/><p>But Camille just shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damned bastard. You should at least tell me your destination.\u2019</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t have any methods of finding him and if he couldn\u2019t even handle such a thing he didn\u2019t have the qualifications to go in the Calamity Fish.</p><br/><p>And it would be very tight for her to gather every material that he had asked her to within the time limit.</p><br/><p>Which meant that she didn\u2019t even have time to deal with such things.</p><br/><p>The moment she bickers with Quadratus she would not be able to gather the materials.</p><br/><p>And he had told her.</p><br/><p>\u2018I believe in you.\u2019</p><br/><p>Camille then quickly moved in order to gather the closest material to her, Apon\u2019s body fluid.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>Hansoo calculated the things he needed to gather and then nodded his head.</p><br/><p>\u2018The first thing I need to get is\u2026 the which is the core ingredient of the Hardening Liquid.&gt;</p><br/><p>The Hardening Liquid required 28 materiels to be mixed with the exact ratio.</p><br/><p>9 of the 28 had been already gathered by Camille and he had asked Camille to gather another 17 of them.</p><br/><p>But he had to gather the remaining two.</p><br/><p> and .</p><br/><p>The other 26 ingredients acted like catalysts so a large amount wasn\u2019t needed but these two were ingredients that will act as the base.</p><br/><p>A very large amount was needed even if they were going to pour it down a fatal location within the Calamity fish since it was that big.</p><br/><p>Hansoo quickly rushed off into the distance.</p><br/><p>Kukulja\u2019s Heart.</p><br/><p>A material which could be gathered in around the middle area of the End Root.</p><br/><p>The Alchemists took into account of the fact that they won\u2019t have much time and had created Hardening Liquid with things one could acquire near the edge of the End Root, where the Calamity Fish would appear, but for him to get something like these\u2026</p><br/><p>The difficulty of this place was very high for it being within the End Root.</p><br/><p>After a long run a giant lake came into view.</p><br/><p>A humongous lake that could separate two End Roots.</p><br/><p>Surprisingly, this giant lake was something that the Kukulja had dug out.</p><br/><p>A lake which the Kukulja, which live in the toxic waters, had dug out from the bottom in order to mate in a place which was originally land.</p><br/><p>Hansoo thought of the conversation he had with Keldian.</p><br/><p>A toxin which didn\u2019t work against Humans but petrified a part of the Calamity Fish.</p><br/><p>And because of this the Kukulja\u2019s heart, which has a large amount of this toxin, was needed in the Hardening Liquid.</p><br/><p>&lt;\u2026It works even though the effect is so miniscule?&gt;</p><br/><p>It would be safer to make them higher up the Root if they were so scared of the Calamity Fish so why would they make it around the End Root area where it would be dangerous.</p><br/><p>Hansoo finished his thoughts and then watched the swaying lake.</p><br/><p>A giant weird looking fish which had the head of a bull and a human\u2019s arms and legs.</p><br/><p>It was so big that each of them exceeded 2m in length.</p><br/><p>But the surprising fact was that the thing he was looking at was an infant.</p><br/><p>These guys grew up to 5m long in adulthood.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ll get them one at a time.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo, who had seen thousands of them squirming around, poured the Demonic Dragon Reinforcement onto a decent scythe he had found on the way to here and then slowly walked into the toxic lake.</p><br/><p>Splash</p><br/><p>As soon as Hansoo came in, all of the Kukulja\u2019s within the lake raised their bull ears.</p><br/><p>&lt;!!!!!!!!!&gt;</p><br/><p>And then started to madly rush towards the origin of the noise and vibration.</p><br/><p>Though the food was still in a shallow place there was no problem.</p><br/><p>Since they could advance while eating through the root.</p><br/><p>Kakakakakak.</p><br/><p>Thousands of teeth-baring fish gnawed onto the bottom of the lake as they charged at Hansoo.</p><br/><p>Hansoo reinforced the scythe he was holding with Demonic Dragon Reinforcement and then slammed it down onto the center of the bull head.</p><br/><p>Kududuk.</p><br/><p>The Kukulja\u2019s skull had made a cracking sound and had split in two but Hansoo made an unsatisfied expression.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tsk. As I expected, it can\u2019t handle the Reinforcement well.\u2019</p><br/><p>If the artifact was bad then it wouldn\u2019t be able to withstand the power of the Reinforcement and would lose its durability fast.</p><br/><p>Though it was a decent weapon which he had gained by hunting down some beasts on the way here it still wasn\u2019t good enough.</p><br/><p>Since the End Root was a neighbourhood designed for beginners and did not have anything hidden.</p><br/><p>\u2018At least I should use it while I can.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo pulled onto the scythe and threw its body onto the land as whole.</p><br/><p>If he left it in the lake like this then everything including the heart will be chewed up by the other fish.</p><br/><p>Creating the extract from the heart was a job after the hunt.</p><br/><p>Kwadududk!</p><br/><p>Paduduk!</p><br/><p>And soon the thousands of fish baring their teeth got stimulated by the blood as they madly charged at Hansoo.</p><br/><p>Kudududk.</p><br/><p>Hansoo applied his Demonic Dragon Reinforcement onto the scythe and then crazily swung it here and there and pulled numerous fish out.</p><br/><p>Chuchuchuk.</p><br/><p>The thousands of fish charged up with incredible speed across the water and then used that momentum to crash into Hansoo and bite him with their teeth.</p><br/><p>The corpses of Kukuljas were stacking outside the lake but Hansoo\u2019s body was equally gaining injuries.</p><br/><p>And at the same time the scythe cracked as it couldn\u2019t handle the power of the Reinforcement anymore.</p><br/><p>Chuchuchuk.</p><br/><p>Hooooong.</p><br/><p>A very large noise coming towards Hansoo was heard as he was preventing the scythe from getting destroyed by adjusting the strength of the Demonic Dragon Reinforcement.</p><br/><p>Shguguguguk.</p><br/><p>An attack which cut apart all the trees near the lake as it flew.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026Skill?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo made a cold expression as he raised his scythe to block the incoming attack.</p><br/><p>Chwuuk.</p><br/><p>The scythe which was filled up with the Demonic Dragon Reinforcement blocked the flying attack but was crushed apart as the result.</p><br/><p>Hansoo blocked off the single attack, jumped out of the lake and then looked towards the direction where the attack had come from.</p><br/><p>And a guy was looking at him while smiling in that place.</p><br/><p>\u201cWoah. You blocked that.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man, who had sheathed his pulsating sword back into his waist, smiled at Hansoo as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello. I\u2019m called Kang Gyesoo. Calm down, I\u2019m not here to fight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t here to fight huh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Gyesoo smiled and continued to speak after seeing Hansoo looked at the destroyed scythe and mumbled.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was just a test. If you couldn\u2019t even block that well\u2026 you\u2019d be useless. Well you pass first of all. Here\u2019s a business card.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gyesoo then threw a whitish object at Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaving something like this makes me feel like I\u2019m in the real world. It\u2019s actually made by drying the Padro Larva. Though it\u2019s a single use, it increases the regeneration speed on the area which you stick it onto so think of me when you use it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo shook his head while looking at the talkative man who had sent the attack with an intention to kill and then asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy have you come?\u2019</p><br/><p>He had consumed a large amount of his stamina from the fight with the Kukulja.</p><br/><p>There was a need to go along with him for a while and regenerate his health.</p><br/><p>Gyesoo spoke out.</p><br/><p>\u201cSimple. You\u2019ve seen a lot of scouting before on T.V right? Like headhunters?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell long story short I work at Quadratus\u2026 a group which is similar to a religion yeah?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a really untrustworthy line.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s skip over the small details. Anyways, it\u2019s not easy following a god. You need a lot of money in Korea too right? It\u2019s the same here. And we have a lot of different businesses in order to fill that up\u2026 and one of them is recruiting talented people and connecting them to clans above who don\u2019t have spare manpower for places like these. And we receive a reward for that. Ah, and starting from here, we do have currency you know?.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gyesoo then rubbed his thumb and index finger.</p><br/><p>When Hansoo didn\u2019t reply, Gyesoo shrugged his shoulders as he continued to talk.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better to not decline. The person who set you in their eyes this time is a bit\u2026 dangerous. Following him is a win-win for you and me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gyesoo then started to get cold sweat.</p><br/><p>The problem wasn\u2019t the guy in front of him.</p><br/><p>It was because this job was something that he had received from a person from one of the six pillars who had come to participate in their sightseeing which they were preparing.</p><br/><p>\u2018Goddamn gangsters.\u2019</p><br/><p>Six Pillars.</p><br/><p>Six super sized clans who were fighting in the Trunk of the World Tree unlike them who were just playing around the Roots.</p><br/><p>And one of them. .</p><br/><p>Kalz Morenn, the captain of the shock troop left by the previous adventurer Keldian Magus, had told him.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026If we aren\u2019t careful then we might die.\u2019</p><br/><p>But unlike what Gyesoo wanted, Hansoo just shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll decline.\u201d</p><br/><p>And at the same time Hansoo made a cold expression.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tsk. So it turns out like this in the end.\u2019</p><br/><p>His objective was the Calamity Fish.</p><br/><p>A collision with the Quadratus was inevitable for him since the path of attaining the Hardening Liquid intersected with them who were preparing the sightseeing business even though he wanted to dodge as many useless collisions possible.</p><br/><p>\u2018Since it turned out like this already. End it quickly.\u2019</p><br/><p>He had already calculated such things as this.</p><br/><p>As Hansoo prepared to fight, Gyesoo\u2019s expression froze.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou fucking bastard\u2026 being arrogant because you beat Camille?\u201d</p><br/><p>Camille was a monster-like existence to the newcomers but was quite a weakling to those who roam around the Trunk and the Roots.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tks. This is my fault huh.\u2019</p><br/><p>That guy was overestimating his worth since he had offered a scouting towards a new Chick.</p><br/><p>He wanted to talk about it but seeing that it didn\u2019t work he gathered all the energy within his body and then poured it into his relic, .</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh. Look at that retard. Over there. To charge at a newcomer who bickers with him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kalz Morenn mumbled while looking at Kang Gyesoo above the cruise ship which the Quadratus guys had prepared for sightseeing with the .</p><br/><p>MVP Sponsor\u2019s note</p><br/><p>You rested long enough whip get back to work whip Wa Ha Ha Whip Whip Whip he he\u2026 just kidding. thank you! for all your hard work\ud83d\ude42</p><br/><p>Proofreader\u2019s note</p><br/><p>Pillar -&gt; Starting Root -&gt; Central Root -&gt; End Root was changed to Trunk -&gt; Base Root -&gt; Middle Root -&gt; End Root. Thank you Psycho for noticing.</p><br/><p>More seriously\u2026 Ekdud \u201cforgot\u201d Demonic before Dragon Reinforcement. Kobato got so mad that his productivity increased and tomorrow there might be two chapters instead of one.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

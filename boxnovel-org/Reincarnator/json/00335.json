Seriously?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be shocked. I\u2019m really talking to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiriel freaked out at the man who was staring directly at where her consciousness was.</p><br/><p>\u2018No way!\u2019</p><br/><p>A memory was something she read.</p><br/><p>Normally, the memory didn\u2019t react to her presence.</p><br/><p>\u2014clank\u2014 </p><br/><p>An ominous feeling ran through her, and she tried to cancel her trait and escape, but it was useless.</p><br/><p>It was as if she was being held down.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be shocked. I mean you no harm. I just tried it out for fun.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Who are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man then seemed to realize something, and exclaimed:</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve forgotten to introduce myself!\u201d</p><br/><p>The man pointed towards the hammer on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am called Nepallem, greetings.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiriel, who\u2019d been listening to his words in a daze, asked:</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you bring me here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nepallem chuckled as he replied:</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t call you, you just got sucked in while trying to read the Mj\u00f6lnir\u2019s memories.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Mj\u00f6lnir?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nepallem nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. That hammer over there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014chiiiiik\u2014 </p><br/><p>Nepallem pointed towards the hammer currently emitting smoke in the middle of the room.</p><br/><p>A hammer that did not look like something simple.</p><br/><p>\u2018...So that\u2019s what it looks like when it\u2019s fused.\u2019</p><br/><p>Kiriel looked at the hammer\u2014it was letting off sparks and burning the contents of the room. She recalled what Hansoo had wanted her to find out, so she asked Nepallem:</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you make that?\u201d</p><br/><p>This current situation as a whole made no sense, but she wasn\u2019t the type to argue about something that was already happening.</p><br/><p>The most important thing was gathering intel.</p><br/><p>The man seemed quite friendly, which meant she had nothing to fear for now.</p><br/><p>\u2018I need to ask as much as I can.\u2019</p><br/><p>But Nepallem shook his head with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I did not make it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI brought it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Brought it? From where?\u2019</p><br/><p>Nepallem looked at Kiriel, who was tilting her head in confusion, and then shook his finger.</p><br/><p>\u201cTelling you everything would be a bit too much. Anyway, I brought it to help a few people below, but\u2026 it seems to be too strong in this form.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nepallem thought of Tiamet, who would be proceeding to perform his revenge, and smiled as he touched the Mj\u00f6lnir with his finger.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014pachchchchciiik!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The lines on Mj\u00f6lnir\u2019s surface radiated a golden light, and the hammer gradually grew weaker. Kiriel\u2019s brows rose up at this sight.</p><br/><p>\u2018It turned into three pieces.\u2019</p><br/><p>It still looked like a hammer, but it was different.</p><br/><p>Since the flow of mana inside it had turned into three separate circuits of their own.</p><br/><p>At this rate, those individual pieces wouldn\u2019t be able to use even half of half of half of half of the original\u2019s power.[a]</p><br/><p>Nepallem looked kindly at Kiriel, and explained with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis should fit this world\u2019s level a bit more.\u201d</p><br/><p>Was it necessary to break the Mj\u00f6lnir down to Tiamet\u2019s level?</p><br/><p>But since he had restructured the hammer to be disassembled, Tiamet would put it to good use.</p><br/><p>He could either wield the hammer to destroy the world.</p><br/><p>Or use them separately in places he needed to.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t matter anyway.</p><br/><p>Since both outcomes would be fun.</p><br/><p>Nepallem, who had been smiling at the hammer, spoke to Kiriel.</p><br/><p>\u201cApparently, it\u2019s been fused again. Though there are still some restrictions but\u2026 Congratulations.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nepallem congratulated Kiriel, and shook her hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cGoodbye, then. Be careful when wielding it. Since it\u2019s not a simple object. Remember who the owner is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014swoooooosh!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2018Huh\u2026 uhh?\u2019</p><br/><p>Kirie\u2019s consciousness suddenly started to return to reality at a tremendous speed.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThat really happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I wanted to read more of the memory, but\u2026 I can\u2019t anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing Kiriel\u2019s account, Hansoo looked at the hammer.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026Brought it?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014crackle\u2014 </p><br/><p>Even after completely destroying the Ark-Roa, the hammer in his hands was still searching for things to smash apart.</p><br/><p>Like its owner.</p><br/><p>Hansoo frowned at the destructive energy running through the hand holding onto the hammer\u2019s handle.</p><br/><p>\u2018I now understand why it\u2019s hard to handle.\u2019</p><br/><p>This hammer was always desiring to destroy.</p><br/><p>No matter if the opponent was an enemy or its owner.</p><br/><p>The moment it smashed apart the Ark-Roa, the energy heading towards the Ark-Roa flew towards Hansoo.</p><br/><p>It ripped his muscles, burnt up his nerves, and broke his bones.</p><br/><p>\u2014crack!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014kuduk!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The destructive energy flowed through Hansoo\u2019s arm and into his body to rip apart his insides.</p><br/><p>His body was going through an infinite loop; the Mj\u00f6lnir was destroying him internally, and the Immortal Soul and Dragon Essence Blade regenerated any damage inflicted.</p><br/><p>He understood why Tiamet had broken this apart.</p><br/><p>Since Tiamet wouldn\u2019t have been able to hold onto this with his past level of strength.</p><br/><p>And Kiriel carefully asked Hansoo:</p><br/><p>\u201c \u2026 Are you going to keep holding onto it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Though she was also at the 2 star level, due to her lack of regenerative and close combat skills, it was very taxing for her to hold it, even for a brief moment.</p><br/><p>She\u2019d end up a mess with just a single day of slowly being gnawed away by it.</p><br/><p>It would be okay in a fight, but for one to always carry it around\u2026 </p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you carry it around in some container? Like a pouch\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>But Hansoo shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>This thing had a huge amount of pride.</p><br/><p>When he\u2019d released it, he felt the reaction of the hammer being much more powerful after holding onto it again.</p><br/><p>It would not accept those that denied this energy as its owner.</p><br/><p>And another thing\u2026 </p><br/><p>\u2018This is going to be helpful for training.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014pajijijik\u2014 </p><br/><p>Hansoo mumbled as he felt the lightning energy burning up his insides.</p><br/><p>Skill masteries improved the more one used it.</p><br/><p>\u2018I guess the next seed on the list is the Immortal Soul.\u2019</p><br/><p>Between the Nine Dragons Spear and the Immortal Soul, he\u2019d wondered which seed he would use to get to the 3 star level, but then decided on the latter.</p><br/><p>He then shouted towards the two fighting in the distance.</p><br/><p>\u2014boom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u201cHurry and finish! We should greet each other since we\u2019ve been separated for so long!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it! You bastard! Help us or something!\u201d</p><br/><p>Karhal gritted his teeth and roared out loud.</p><br/><p>His expression was full of glee, though.</p><br/><p>\u2014roooaaar!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The Ark-Roa\u2019s clone, the hunting dog, still remained and it was trying its best to resist being killed off by Karhal and Ekidu.</p><br/><p>It was indeed trying its best, but it was not an opponent for the two after its original body had been destroyed.</p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Surrounded by her White River Demonic Art, Ekidu smashed the chest of the dog, and shouted at Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust rest for a bit! We\u2019ll be right over!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026 It really has been a while. For her to use such words.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo then put the hammer down, and sat on it.</p><br/><p>\u2014pachichichiciii!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The Mj\u00f6lnir retaliated as if to say that it wasn\u2019t a chair, but Hansoo ignored it and relaxed.</p><br/><p>He was indeed tired.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ugh\u2026 it hasn\u2019t even been a week since I woke up.\u2019</p><br/><p>But Hansoo chuckled.</p><br/><p>Two years was a long time to rest.</p><br/><p>And there was a long way for him to go.</p><br/><p>At that moment\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014kiriririring\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014a healing aura entered Hansoo\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Right, what shall I do with this child\u2026?\u2019</p><br/><p>One thing was clear: he didn\u2019t dislike this girl either.</p><br/><p>As Hansoo smirked at Kiriel, who was healing him with a happy smile\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u201cHa! Hahaha! This bastard! It\u2019s finally dead!\u201d</p><br/><p>At Karhal\u2019s shout, the black dog fell down with a hole in its heart.</p><br/><p>\u2014ssss\u2014 </p><br/><p>The black dog trembled for a moment in rage as it looked around, but then collapsed.</p><br/><p>It then turned into black powder, dispersing into the air.</p><br/><p>sssss\u2026.</p><br/><p>At that moment\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ekidu, who had been standing in front of the black powder, asked out loud, causing Hansoo, Kiriel, and everyone else to look at where the Ark-Roa\u2019s corpse had fallen.</p><br/><p>Then they saw it. </p><br/><p>A human-head-sized box amidst the black powder.</p><br/><p>Along with a small letter.</p><br/><p>Hansoo focused with his eyes, and looked at the word on the letter.</p><br/><p>[GIFT].</p><br/><p>\u2018So it only treats it as dead when the clone gets killed as well, huh?\u2026 But why didn\u2019t it appear itself?\u2019</p><br/><p>Confused, Hansoo looked at the box that seemed to have been left behind by the fairy.</p><br/><p>[a]Yes it's one eighth, but this is what the raws say xD</p><br/>\n</div>"}

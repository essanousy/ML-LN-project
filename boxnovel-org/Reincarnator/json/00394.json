The issue here is that most of them have been cut off.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Kiriel finished her words\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014Hansoo\u2019s expression froze.</p><br/><p>And he quickly made a decision.</p><br/><p>\u201cGive up the crystal. Leave immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Wasn\u2019t this extremely important?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is. But we can\u2019t touch it anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018We need to go somewhere else first. I now know why Clementine\u2019s forces and Sanjin gave this up.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was a wise choice to do so.</p><br/><p>Unlike the stupid actions of John Stone.</p><br/><p>\u2018I need to clean this place up before we leave\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked at the remaining strands and the crystal as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cKiriel, stay and protect this place. We cannot let anyone take the crystal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? What about you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked up and muttered:</p><br/><p>\u201cThe ones who might cause a catastrophe\u2026 I need to pull them out by the roots.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014boooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>With a loud bang, Hansoo\u2019s body quickly ascended through the hole.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh\u2026 Hurry! We need to stop them before they get the crystal!\u201d</p><br/><p>John Stone gritted his teeth.</p><br/><p>Such horrible timing for a thief to appear.</p><br/><p>He\u2019d worked too hard.</p><br/><p>If he\u2019d been slightly more laid back in dealing with the strands, he wouldn\u2019t feel so pressured to rush over there.</p><br/><p>But sadly, he and his underlings had taken turns day and night and had almost cut off all the strands from the crystal.</p><br/><p>The remainder was more than enough for Hansoo to cut off by himself.</p><br/><p>\u2018No\u2026 That thief! I was so close!\u2019</p><br/><p>All his hard work\u2026</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t let anyone take it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry! Hurry up! All of you!\u201d.</p><br/><p>John Stone continued to scream.</p><br/><p>Not only towards his underlings but to the people of Reyunion as well, who\u2019d armed themselves with their mechanical weapons.</p><br/><p>And everyone frowned at these shouts.</p><br/><p>John Stone saw this, but he didn\u2019t have time to care what they thought.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t usually act this way.</p><br/><p>No matter how strong he was, if he pushed them too hard, then he was bound to end up backstabbed.</p><br/><p>Although he acted arrogantly, they wouldn\u2019t act out of place as long as he treated them well.</p><br/><p>But this situation was different.</p><br/><p>Because of his towering rage, his Trait\u2014Berserk Mode\u2014was continuously active.</p><br/><p>But then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014boooom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014something rose up from the depths like a meteor and landed before them.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn! Prepare for battle!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s expressions turned grim at the terrifying aura of the being currently approaching them.</p><br/><p>But John Stone\u2019s expression brightened up.</p><br/><p>\u2018Kang Hansoo!\u2019</p><br/><p>John Stone was extremely glad that Hansoo wasn\u2019t by the crystal anymore and was here instead.</p><br/><p>Due to this to his rage died down a bit, his sanity returning as he shouted at the man.</p><br/><p>Of course, he wasn\u2019t entirely sane just yet.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastard! How dare you?! Trying to take what\u2019s rightfully mine\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is why I came here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u2019</p><br/><p>John Stone flinched at Hansoo\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Hansoo ignored him as he continued to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt should be fine to leave you guys alone, but\u2026 you\u2019ll probably cause a huge ruckus if I do.\u201d</p><br/><p>The people of Reyunion couldn\u2019t cut the strands even if they wanted to.</p><br/><p>Only Transcendents could manage it, although just barely.</p><br/><p>Without the Flame, they were as good as usual.</p><br/><p>But John Stone was different.</p><br/><p>He would do whatever he could to cut off the strands and take the crystal.</p><br/><p>And he could not let that happen.</p><br/><p>It was better to let those things stay asleep.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ll just drag them all away.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014whooosh!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Red clouds started to seep out from Hansoo\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014boom! boom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>Kiriel listened to the noises echoing from the far distance and looked around the darkness in curiosity.</p><br/><p>\u2018...So, we can\u2019t take the crystal.\u2019</p><br/><p>There was only one reason she could think of for why they couldn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>In case they might awaken the sleeping beings inside it.</p><br/><p>Although it was weird that those beings had worked so hard to reach here just to sleep, but since that crystal was the sole reason for their slumber, it made a lot of sense not to touch it.</p><br/><p>Of course, she had another question.</p><br/><p>\u2018Can\u2019t we just ignore them and take it?\u2019</p><br/><p>Kiriel thought as she looked around.</p><br/><p>She knew that these things were strong.</p><br/><p>Since they had gone through countless Transcendents to reach this place.</p><br/><p>And they should\u2019ve already recovered their strength after their long period of rest.</p><br/><p>If that crystal was that amazing, couldn\u2019t they just take it and use its strength to kill off those beings?</p><br/><p>Even if the crystal didn\u2019t help them in battle, it didn\u2019t seem like it was impossible to go up against those beings.</p><br/><p>But she only questioned this for a moment.</p><br/><p>\u2018There\u2019s probably a reason.\u2019</p><br/><p>Kiriel decided to stop questioning Hansoo\u2019s choices and sat in front of the crystal.</p><br/><p>There was probably a reason why everyone else had given up on the crystal as well.</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s going to come here anyway\u2026 Should I just go up and help?\u2019</p><br/><p>The sounds of explosions were lessening as well.</p><br/><p>But as she was thinking\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? We meet again!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014a familiar voice rang out from behind her.</p><br/><p>\u2018What? There was another entrance in the back?\u2019</p><br/><p>Opposite to where she and Hansoo had entered, somebody was walking through the darkness and approaching her.</p><br/><p>And as she turned to the familiar voice\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014her expression changed to a frown.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, I didn\u2019t expect to see you here. Well, thanks for what happened last time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kiriel looked with displeasure at N-Aroel who had walked out from the darkness.</p><br/><p>N-Aroel, the Nerpa, shrugged his shoulders and answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm, I\u2019ve come to find something I need.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Nerpa pointed towards the crystal that was floating in the darkness.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

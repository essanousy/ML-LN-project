Tens of thousands?\u2019</p><br/><p>Gwanje\u2019s hands flinched.</p><br/><p>It felt like that he will really go crazy if he couldn\u2019t get ahold of that guy in front of his eyes.</p><br/><p>But the thought of tens of thousands of people dying kept on delaying his actions.</p><br/><p>While Gwanje was pondering over this problem, a line of voice rang out from an unknown location.</p><br/><p>Gwanje clenched his teeth at that moment.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damnit.\u2019</p><br/><p>The others would\u2019ve almost reached the Forest of Horns by now.</p><br/><p>He needed to go as well.</p><br/><p>In order to control them.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ll visit there before I go.\u2019</p><br/><p>He needed to calm himself down after getting so worked up.</p><br/><p>Gwanje looked at Bali Roper with a glare filled with rage for the last time and then flew towards the ant tunnels.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is he leaving?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo frowned as he looked at Gwanje backing off in the distance.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s a bit regrettable.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo momentarily made an regretful expression.</p><br/><p>He was going to throw Bali Roper out as a bait if that guy charged at him and then capture him.</p><br/><p>But that guy somehow managed to suppress down his rage and then backed off.</p><br/><p>Of course there still was something that he had gained from this short encounter.</p><br/><p>\u201cBali Roper. Amazing. Looking forward to working with you more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Mmm? Oh okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bali Roper felt strange from Hansoo\u2019s sudden compliments but he just thought of it as Hansoo praising his skills and just ignored it.</p><br/><p>\u2018It seems like I\u2019ll be able to use this guy in the future. I should keep him alive and well.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo labeled Bali Roper a useful bait and then looked at his surroundings.</p><br/><p>Though many clansmen had died, they had maintained quite a large amount of force.</p><br/><p>He just needed to quickly regroup with the Akarons and help them.</p><br/><p>Forest of Horns was basically where the Margoths lived in.</p><br/><p>It wouldn\u2019t be easy even for the five pillars that protected the Priest.</p><br/><p>At that moment a single carrier pigeon flew towards Hansoo.</p><br/><p>There was the direction where they had headed towards that Sangjin had scouted written down on the carrier pigeon.</p><br/><p>\u2018Past the 11th region\u2026 past the 14th\u2026 towards the 19th region huh.\u2019</p><br/><p>11th region located above the thorax region and the 14th region that was located on the neck.</p><br/><p>And the 19 region that was located on the back side of the head of the Margoths.</p><br/><p>Soon Hansoo realized what the destination of these people were.</p><br/><p>\u2018Forest of Horns. They\u2019re going to the Forest of Horns.\u2019</p><br/><p>Forest of Horns.</p><br/><p>The name of the forest located between the two giant mountain-like horns upon the huge head of the Gragos.</p><br/><p>The destinations of the Akarons and these people were the same.</p><br/><p>Of course it might just be a coincidence.</p><br/><p>Though it was called a forest, it was actually extremely wide and vast.</p><br/><p>The location of controlling the Gragos that the Akaron were headed towards was located in this forest as well.</p><br/><p>The Forest of Horns was a location that the clans used very frequently due to the high level skills and artifacts that drop there.</p><br/><p>But the destinations and the times overlapped each other too perfectly.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026These guys. Did they put the Graphite in here in order to drag out the Akarons.\u2019</p><br/><p>How did these guys know about this?</p><br/><p>And how did they know to get to the Forest of Horns?</p><br/><p>At that moment another possibility was thought of in Hansoo\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u2018There\u2019s another Akaron.\u2019</p><br/><p>An Akaron that had gifted Gwanje the body enhancement surgery and the intel.</p><br/><p>An Akaron who couldn\u2019t show itself to the other Akarons and was doing this because of a reason.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m here you damned bastard.\u201d</p><br/><p>An Akaron who was making an arrogant expression nodded as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still arrogant. I\u2019ll allow that much since you\u2019re useful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gwanje snorted inwardly.</p><br/><p>A guy who had all sorts of glamorous artifacts hung around his body despite being holed up in a corner.</p><br/><p>Akarons couldn\u2019t even use those artifacts.</p><br/><p>The Akaron over there, who called himself a previous Great Priest, had these artifacts dangling upon his body in order to disguise himself.</p><br/><p>\u2018He\u2019s like a King of a fallen country.\u2019</p><br/><p>But his own situation was much worse.</p><br/><p>Since he couldn\u2019t even go against that guy\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>The Akaron seemed like it had guessed his intentions, it laughed coldly as it spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t act around as you want. You and I made a contract.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gwanje clenched his teeth at those words.</p><br/><p>His chances of survival when he had jumped into the Reflux Organ 4 years ago due to Bali Roper was actually 0%.</p><br/><p>Since he had received quite a deep injury and had to take care of his unconscious wife as well.</p><br/><p>And the reason why he had been able to live was because of the Akaron that was in front of his eyes.</p><br/><p>The guy who called himself the Great Priest.</p><br/><p>Right before he fell unconscious, the Akaron dragged him out and then whispered into his ear.</p><br/><p>And when he had woken up everything had changed.</p><br/><p>An overflowing amount of strength and a powerful body.</p><br/><p>To the point where he had thought that he had been reborn at first.</p><br/><p>But he knew instantly.</p><br/><p>That this guy hadn\u2019t given this surgery to him out of generosity.</p><br/><p>The Akaron said these words to him back then.</p><br/><p>And as the Akaron in front of his eyes threw a bit of incense, his body forcibly knelt in front of the Akaron.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damnit.\u2019</p><br/><p>Gwanje clenched his teeth after thinking of back then.</p><br/><p>Since he had to work crazily since then.</p><br/><p>In order to accomplish the thing this guy wanted him to.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t hard.</p><br/><p>Since the intel and the strength that this guy had given him were not just a bit.</p><br/><p>Gwanje calmed down his mind and then spoke towards the Akaron.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Akarons popped out after we petrified the body fluid like you told me to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. They\u2019ll need to move.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Akaron laughed coldly.</p><br/><p>They needed to get to the Forest of Horns in order to move the Gragos to another Gragos.</p><br/><p>How could they remain hidden after getting the black warning even if they were hidden so well.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re almost there. Just catch them all. Killing a few is alright as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gwanje frowned at the Akaron mumbling about how killing his own kind was fine.</p><br/><p>How could a previous Great Priest talk about the lives of his own kind with such ease?</p><br/><p>\u2018That\u2019s why he got chased out by his own race.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 What are you trying to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Great Priest laughed coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to know about that. Don\u2019t cross the line. Just go finish off what you need to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Gwanje grinded his teeth but he couldn\u2019t do anything</p><br/><p>Though his body was suppressed, it wasn\u2019t perfect.</p><br/><p>There were many ways he could dodge his control but he couldn\u2019t even if he wanted to.</p><br/><p>\u2018Mihyang my darling.\u2019</p><br/><p>The only person he could find comfort upon after the death of his daughter.</p><br/><p>Gwanje looked at his wife who was sleeping like the dead behind the Akaron.</p><br/><p>The Akaron laughed as if it had sensed that Gwanje was looking at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like my words were a bit harsh. It means that you don\u2019t need to care about it that much. I\u2019ll release your beloved as I promised. I\u2019ll also erase the controlling method inside your body. You just need to go to that Yellow Zone then. Simple right? It won\u2019t matter what happens here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gwanje set his mind from those words.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yeah. This is a trade. This is definitely not a bad thing.\u2019</p><br/><p>Though he had to work like a dog for 4 years, the reward wasn\u2019t bad.</p><br/><p>Since he had escaped a lethal situation and had gained the strength to protect his wife.</p><br/><p>He just needed to go up to the Yellow Zone after he was done with this.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s almost over.\u2019</p><br/><p>The contract was to lure out the hidden Akarons and to capture them.</p><br/><p>He had gathered and increased his power and influence because of this.</p><br/><p>Since he needed to be extremely strong as well in order to capture those strong Akarons.</p><br/><p>But this was now all over.</p><br/><p>Seeing the screwed up Ursa Majors and the Rerorerore clansmen was getting tiring.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t have any ambitions of finding the Temple and taking control of the Gragos in the first place.</p><br/><p>It was that he needed to put on air like this in order to create the clan.</p><br/><p>After this he would be able to leave this damned Orange Zone.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh. One more thing. If you meet those guys later\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Gwanje frowned after hearing what the Akaron said.</p><br/><p>\u2018He has a real fucked up mind.\u2019</p><br/><p>But he had done what he needed to here.</p><br/><p>His mind calmed down a bit more after seeing his wife and felt his sanity returning.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yeah. Right now\u2026 I must focus on the living instead of the dead.\u2019</p><br/><p>He had to act in order to save his living wife instead of being enraged because of his dead daughter.</p><br/><p>Gwanje looked at his wife once more, got out of the dark ant tunnels and then quickly headed towards the head of the Gragos.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Kuooooo!</p><br/><p>Taruhol landed on the ground after smashing the head of the giant herbivore-shaped Margoth Du Gracios with a body full of injuries.</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>A huge soundwave resonated out and Ailen quickly ran upand started to look over Taruhol\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Taruhol shook his hands and pushed back Ailen.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright. You go and fight as well. There\u2019s a lack of manpower.\u201d</p><br/><p>Taruhol mumbled as he saw the two giant horns in the distance.</p><br/><p>The path of the Forest of Horns was much more intense than they had expected.</p><br/><p>Since the numbers of Margoths had multiplied numerous times.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026If we don\u2019t organize these guys then a disaster will happen. Anyways we\u2019re almost there.\u2019</p><br/><p>They just needed to get through the gap in between the cliff in front of their eyes.</p><br/><p>The moment Taruhol turned to catch some breath, something flew in from the distance.</p><br/><p>\u2018What!\u2019</p><br/><p>Booooom!</p><br/><p>The skill which had flown in from above the cliff flipped the grounds upside down and Taruhol, who had momentarily dropped his guard, prepared for the ambush.</p><br/><p>At that moment a large shout was heard from above the cliff.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know I missed you on purpose right?\u201d</p><br/><p>And behind the woman, thousands of clansmen appeared on one of the cliffs.</p><br/><p>Taruhol made an expression of disbelief at the human army.</p><br/><p>\u2018They were waiting?\u2019</p><br/><p>The path to the Forest of Horns was harsh beyond reason for humans.</p><br/><p>Why were these guys there when there wouldn\u2019t have much to do here?</p><br/><p>The woman above the cliff spoke while looking at that Taruhol.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like our friends from the clan will be a bit late. Let\u2019s just play around on our own until then. Oh and\u2026 Our clan leader told us to tell you something to you guys.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then one of the members of the Ursa Major, Akaella, looked at the red carrier pigeon sent by Gwanje and made a confused expression.</p><br/><p>\u2018What does this mean?\u2019</p><br/><p>But there were many things they didn\u2019t understand that came from Gwanje.</p><br/><p>Akaella just read the message on the carrier pigeon.</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulations. My clan. You will soon be able to follow me, your first leader, all over again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Taruhol and the priest, Oteon, made an expression of despair at those words.</p><br/><p>First leader.</p><br/><p>The only person arrogant enough to call himself the first leader that they knew of was one person.</p><br/><p>Great Priest, Karbana.</p><br/><p>The person who had fought with Mekido the Great patriarch, put on all blame and responsibility onto Mekido who had created the Body Enhancement Surgery when the Calamity of Death had hit and had run away.</p><br/><p>\u2018He wasn\u2019t dead huh.\u2019</p><br/><p>But they realized that this wasn\u2019t the time to worry about such things.</p><br/><p>Taruhol clenched his teeth at the three Margoth level adventurers and the thousands of clansmen charging towards him as he went out to meet them.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hurry up Hansoo. I don\u2019t know how long I can keep up with this.\u2019</p><br/><p>Boooom!</p><br/><p>Soon a huge shockwave and a loud sounds ran throughout the Forest of Horns.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018I need to hurry.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo moved quickly.</p><br/><p>It was a race for time.</p><br/><p>Whether Gwanje and the other three Ursa Majors arrive first along with their forces.</p><br/><p>Or him arriving first along with the Crown Clan\u2019s forces.</p><br/><p>If they combine the two forces on both sides then the total strength was similar.</p><br/><p>This was why the side which receives the reinforcement first will be at a much greater advantage.</p><br/><p>\u2018I must arrive there first.\u2019</p><br/><p>Bali Roper cried out while following behind him closely.</p><br/><p>Why was he moving in such a hurry?</p><br/><p>The sensation of his body moving in such a hurry without his own intentions was not quite a good feeling.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s slow down a bit!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo turned around and smiled kindly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Oh yeah, I had a secret weapon\u2019</p><br/><p>If the thing that could move the enemy leader was not a secret weapon then what would it be?</p><br/><p>\u201cOh yes. Our Bali Roper is a man who would do great things for us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018This feels a little bad for some reason.\u2019</p><br/><p>Bali Roper, who felt a chill, started to run even faster in order to get rid of the sensation.</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s note</p><br/><p>I\u2019m still sick. This chapter took twice as long as usual ; n;</p><br/><p>Proofreader\u2019s note</p><br/><p>Regular chapter 3/3.</p><br/><p>This is the 6th chapter of the week, with one sponsored chapter on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday (that made a special double release that day).</p><br/><p>Often we see people acting with a certain mindset only to later on understand that something else was at play\u2026 I almost feel like sometimes the author changed his mind about stuff. Like Gwanje moved up the timeline to attack the Gragos for the audience and Hansoo that would be part of it. Although just maybe, he used this as an excuse in order to get his wife back faster?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

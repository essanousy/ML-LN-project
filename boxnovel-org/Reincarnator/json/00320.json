There\u2019s no better place to gain more slaves than here.\u2019</p><br/><p>This location, where the abyssal race and the newcomers continuously poured out, was the best place to raise their individual strength in the most efficient manner.</p><br/><p>Zeus spoke to Hansoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cGroup them up and control them. Why are you busying yourself? You can just make them into your slaves and make your life easier.\u201d</p><br/><p>In this world, strength was basically the law.</p><br/><p>The reason why he and the other eleven struggled so hard to get stronger was because they had already encountered even stronger beings.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo merely scoffed at Zeus.</p><br/><p>\u2018Crystals\u2026 they\u2019re a convenient item.\u2019</p><br/><p>A convenient item, indeed.</p><br/><p>And he wanted other people to use them to get stronger.</p><br/><p>He was different than them.</p><br/><p>He, who had already gained the rights.</p><br/><p>And they, who needed the crystals to climb higher.</p><br/><p>Of course he would also get stronger much faster if he used that spear.</p><br/><p>He could probably go up through the Blue and Indigo zones faster as well.</p><br/><p>But that wouldn\u2019t do.</p><br/><p>If he did this, the final barrier would block him.</p><br/><p>\u2018You should know how lucky you are.\u2019</p><br/><p>If he needed crystals, Zeus would\u2019ve long been dead.</p><br/><p>Since they\u2019d need to fight over the crystals anyway.</p><br/><p>\u2014crack\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeus cried out as he felt the grasp on his throat tighten.</p><br/><p>\u2018This maniac.\u2019</p><br/><p>Though Zeus also preferred to think with his fists more often than not, this Hansoo guy was just too much.</p><br/><p>Weren\u2019t they in the same boat?</p><br/><p>\u201cHey\u2026 even if you did win, aren\u2019t you being too unreasonable? Damned bastard\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo had clearly said that he was useful.</p><br/><p>If Hansoo really needed him, then shouldn\u2019t he at least treat him like a human being?</p><br/><p>Then\u2014</p><br/><p>Hansoo tightened his grip even more.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe there\u2019s a misunderstanding. We aren\u2019t equals just because we\u2019re in the same boat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014crash\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhuuk! Haa...Haa.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI steer the boat, you row it. Got it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeus attempted to retaliate by using the Thunder King\u2019s Road, but then realized he couldn\u2019t due to the red energy surrounding his heart and his brain.</p><br/><p>His rage instantly died down as he felt the energy surrounding his heart.</p><br/><p>\u2018...I\u2019m in some deep sh*t now. Damnit.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked at Zeus\u2019s eyes and realized that it was the right time to speak.</p><br/><p>Hansoo sat next to Zeus and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201c...You seem to be in a hurry. Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeus\u2019 attitude was not that of an attacker.</p><br/><p>But rather that of a defender.</p><br/><p>Hansoo was curious at Zeus\u2019s actions\u2014he acted like something was bound to come chasing after them.</p><br/><p>\u201c...\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know, it\u2019s possible that I could slow down, too. What do you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeus frowned, but told Hansoo all he knew.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026Who could it be?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo frowned.</p><br/><p>He wondered which one of his enemies would want him dead that badly, but he couldn\u2019t quite put a finger on it.</p><br/><p>Someone that strong would\u2019ve left an impression on Hansoo if they\u2019d ever met.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is it Jang Oh? If I hadn\u2019t just seen that corpse, it wouldn\u2019t be this confusing.\u2019</p><br/><p>He was puzzled by the mysterious corpse that could\u2019ve been Jang Oh.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Zeus spoke out carefully.</p><br/><p>\u201c...Let\u2019s just go up, man. Damn it, it\u2019s not that hard to go up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeus mumbled.</p><br/><p>Though he had his own territory here, it wasn\u2019t as important as his own life.</p><br/><p>Though he didn\u2019t know what lay above, two transcendents should be able to survive.</p><br/><p>The Abyssal Crystals\u2014the tickets for the way up\u2014they were a joke to acquire anyway.</p><br/><p>But Hansoo only chuckled.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have friends who I know will help me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Who?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeus asked in shock.</p><br/><p>\u2018...He had friends?\u2019</p><br/><p>That changed everything.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho? Can you bring them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo shrugged at Zeus\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cDepends on how you do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026F***.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeus grit his teeth as he realized who Hansoo\u2019s \u2018friends\u2019 were\u2014they were his own allies.</p><br/><p>Hansoo continued to speak with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome on, say who your allies are.\u201d</p><br/><p>These guys knew each other for sure, and Hansoo wanted to know everything about them.</p><br/><p>Where they lived.</p><br/><p>Which skills they used.</p><br/><p>What their weaknesses were.</p><br/><p>What they did with their territories.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll add your friends if you do. I told you, I\u2019m only steering the boat and you would be rowing\u2026 Isn\u2019t it better to row together with your friends rather than alone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeus\u2019s expression turned nasty.</p><br/><p>And after a short period of thought, he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cF***\u2026fine! I\u2019ll tell you everything! I\u2019ll tell you, but\u2026 let\u2019s use those guys over there at least!\u201d</p><br/><p>He started out calm, but he was shouting by the time his sentence ended.</p><br/><p>Hansoo continued to just stare at him, so he started pointing at the War Fortress and shouted:</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy! Why aren\u2019t you using them!? You have to live, right? Huh? Look how useful they are! They can be laborers, scouts and\u2026and even meat shields! Shouldn\u2019t you utilize everything at your disposal to win!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Their opponents wouldn\u2019t be easy.</p><br/><p>No, his allies, all eleven of them, were tough nuts on their own.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t want to die yet.</p><br/><p>\u2018Meat shield\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo chuckled.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is why I like you guys.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Eres, you told me before. That\u2026 that I should not kill them.\u2019</p><br/><p>But a small voice came out from the depths of his mind.</p><br/><p>Hansoo chuckled at the whispers of the Pandemic Blade\u2019s seed.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is all because of you anyway, it\u2019s basically all done. Besides\u2026 who could it be?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked to the west.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>The Flier flew through the air and continued to head west.</p><br/><p>Past a city with humans.</p><br/><p>Past a village with a small population.</p><br/><p>Towards the far west.</p><br/><p>The capital of the Empire.</p><br/><p>\u2014rumble\u2014</p><br/><p>A man was standing where the Empire\u2019s Capital had once been.</p><br/><p>In the middle of the White Dragon Arena, where Tiamet had stood and absorbed the enemy.</p><br/><p>\u2014flutter\u2014</p><br/><p>The moment the flier landed, the stone-like expression of the man altered slightly.</p><br/><p>\u2018What is this?\u2019</p><br/><p>The man walked up to the paper and read it.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s expression brightened up.</p><br/><p>\u201c...Finally.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Where have you been sleeping, Kang Hansoo?\u2019</p><br/><p>He had found him.</p><br/><p>Finally\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018Good, it seems that I\u2019ll be able to avenge you, Jang Oh.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2014crack!\u2014</p><br/><p>The man smiled as he smashed the white Rangkom\u2019s Stake into the ground.</p><br/><p>And then\u2014</p><br/><p>D-D-D-D-Diii</p><br/><p>The mana node which flowed through the entire continent started to reverberate.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

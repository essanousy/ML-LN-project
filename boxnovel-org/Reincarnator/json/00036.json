You at least feel good. Since you can escape during times of crisis because you have the crystal.\u201d</p><br/><p>And then Hansoo chuckled at Hyunwoo who was looking at him enviably.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not going.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah? Well. Logically speaking, you\u2019re probably here because you have something to gain.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo chucked as he looked at Hyunwoo who was mumbling \u2018Because you\u2019d gone up if that wasn\u2019t the case.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Well. Those words are right.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was better for him to go up then to stay down here since he wasn\u2019t a Clan Lord who logically had to save everybody.</p><br/><p>Since the hunting efficiency here was rather low.</p><br/><p>The only runes that came out were from killing the Demons but the amount they dropped wasn\u2019t really satisfying it if you take into account their strength.</p><br/><p>Some people who have already fulfilled the requirements of other islands rather quickly were probably already roaming around the most attractive area out of the islands above, The .</p><br/><p>Since this fact was already on the Island Maps.</p><br/><p>But he hadn\u2019t come here for such things from the start.</p><br/><p>\u2018Demonic Jade Crystal.\u2019</p><br/><p>If he didn\u2019t obtain the from the end of the Demon Lord\u2019s Castle then there was no point even if he got to the end of the final dungeon.</p><br/><p>He wouldn\u2019t have known its existence without Eres.</p><br/><p>Eres wasn\u2019t in the condition to utilize it properly but he could pull out all the power from the Demonic Jade Crystal.</p><br/><p>He had come here for the Demonic Jade Crystal, the Judgement and Justice of Dekrados were merely part of the process.</p><br/><p>\u2018About 21 crystals collected.\u2019</p><br/><p>Also, if he were to hunt with ease then he could probably obtain the Justice of Dekrados also.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt kind of seems like the Clan Lords don\u2019t like you much. Is it because you\u2019re strong?\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no reason to hate Hansoo in Hyunwoo\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>He helped others well, was diligent in his own part of the work and felt very secure because he was strong.</p><br/><p>There were basic rules and he was very diligent in following them.</p><br/><p>The reason why the non-clansmen had followed him at the start was because of this.</p><br/><p>Though they had all split up now.</p><br/><p>Hansoo chuckled as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell there\u2019s that but\u2026it\u2019s as you say. They just don\u2019t like me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The road was long and they didn\u2019t know when an enemy will appear.</p><br/><p>If they thought logically then they had to combine their strength in order to defeat the enemy.</p><br/><p>But Lords were a little different.</p><br/><p>Historically speaking, it wasn\u2019t that the kings did not slash off the necks of capable generals because there was an enemy.</p><br/><p>Lords instinctively hated people who didn\u2019t work in their way.</p><br/><p>Lord of a Clan.</p><br/><p>As soon as you awake the trait , you realize it instinctively.</p><br/><p>That your words became the law and the rules within this household.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know himself but according to the words of Eres, it was a very addictive and amazing feeling where you are living in the modern society and then getting into a situation where others had to listen to your words.</p><br/><p>And they tried to increase the number of their clan because of this.</p><br/><p>To increase their influence inside and outwards as well as to apply the rules they created.</p><br/><p>The reason why the Lords increased their power wasn\u2019t just for survival.</p><br/><p>But who would like it when somebody else were to come and then tell them to follow different rules.</p><br/><p>It was a different problem from their own rules being right or wrong, he, who was an , couldn\u2019t have a good relation with Lords from the start.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well they might not be able to judge things reasonably.\u2019</p><br/><p>The Lords who had been around for tens of decades were growing impatient because they couldn\u2019t kill him.</p><br/><p>The fact that the ones who just became Lords were around him and were suppressing themselves was even more amazing.</p><br/><p>Since reason and emotion are different from the start.</p><br/><p>And when somebody sets their mind on something, they\u2019re bound to create some reason for it in their head.</p><br/><p>\u2018They still need to grow a lot.\u2019</p><br/><p>A new ability.</p><br/><p>And a new world where they can use it freely.</p><br/><p>It was obvious that they wanted to swing around the fascinating new sword that they had obtained.</p><br/><p>And getting angry was normal since they met somebody which their sword, which usually worked well, didn\u2019t work against.</p><br/><p>But they needed to see more and hear more.</p><br/><p>And they had to realize that this was just the start.</p><br/><p>And that was why they needed to escape the tutorial area in order to survive.</p><br/><p>The most important quality of a Lord wasn\u2019t suppressing the other Lord.</p><br/><p>Suppressing oneself and knowing how to work with other Lords was the most important thing.</p><br/><p>Even Kwang Goonju and the Lord of Dark Angler weren\u2019t self-assertive.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well. It\u2019s a little early for them to know of it. Anyways, I should try a little bit harder.\u2019</p><br/><p>What would he do by showing off his strength against baby Lords in the tutorial area.</p><br/><p>The people here were people who came from living in the real world and had only been here for about a month.</p><br/><p>They might look at him in a marvelous way but if Hansoo wasn\u2019t able to do at least this much then Kangtae would\u2019ve probably went overboard.</p><br/><p>His real rivals were people who have been here for a few years or even 20 years while going through all sorts of hardships from square one.</p><br/><p>People who had broken through a tutorial like this over 10 or so years ago and had been roaming around the Otherworld for a long time.</p><br/><p>His goal wasn\u2019t to be ahead of others by 1 to 2 years.</p><br/><p>He had to catch up to 20 years between him and them.</p><br/><p>Hansoo loosened up the tension in his body as he approached the first gateway, the Door of Bones.</p><br/><p>\u2018The time it will take to eat up the rest of the members will be about 3 days\u2026 it seems it\u2019ll take a while.\u2019</p><br/><p>The non-clansmen couldn\u2019t follow him.</p><br/><p>They will receive more damage than usual as the environment gets harsher if they did not have the commands of a Lord.</p><br/><p>And that was why he induced the Clan Lords to absorb them back in.</p><br/><p>Since it seemed like most members had been absorbed into the clans, things were doable.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s have a look here.\u2019</p><br/><p>They\u2019ll have some sort of an image as they see how he deals with the Gatekeeper.</p><br/><p>Hansoo smiled at Hyunwoo then slowly walked forward.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Guktae frowned as he looked at the giant door in front of him.</p><br/><p>A giant door that seemed like it was made of hundreds of thousands if not millions of bones.</p><br/><p>One could see that from the door that reminded of France\u2019s Arc de Triomphe, a fearful aura was coming off from it.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s see\u2026 the remaining number is 1200.\u2019</p><br/><p>100 died in 3 days.</p><br/><p>From one\u2019s view it was merely a trivial loss.</p><br/><p>This was a result that came off from Hansoo and the Special forces fighting the Demons competitively.</p><br/><p>If both of them were slugging about then the damage would have skyrocketed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well. Since they have almost absorbed them all.\u2019</p><br/><p>As people saw that Hansoo didn\u2019t care about keeping them safe and was focused on hunting the Demons, they all ran and joined the clans.</p><br/><p>They had all realized.</p><br/><p>Though Hansoo can hunt all the Demons with his body alone, that he could not defend them from the attacks of countless mages</p><br/><p>If they didn\u2019t go into the clans then the special forces wouldn\u2019t defend them and then they\u2019ll be wide open against the attacks of the mages.</p><br/><p>Though the people who had survived from Hansoo hunting the Demons were hundreds, being safer was the better option.</p><br/><p>While Guktae was making a satisfied expression, a familiar existence appeared in front of the Giant Door.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello everyone. Welcome to the first of the three doors, the Door of Bones.\u201d</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t any other name that more befitting.</p><br/><p>The fairy who had seen the people\u2019s expressions nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very simple. Do you see the giant door over there? You just need to get past it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026It\u2019s closed.\u201d</p><br/><p>The giant door that the fairy pointed to was firmly closed.</p><br/><p>But then climbing the walls that stretched tens of meters next to it seemed impossible.</p><br/><p>No, if they were meant to be climbed then why would the door exist.</p><br/><p>\u2018We don\u2019t even know if the fairy might kill us as an example on the way up.\u2019</p><br/><p>Their lives were too precious to test climbing up the wall when they could just talk it out.</p><br/><p>The fairy laughed as it spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cEehee. You need to pay a passing fee.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone made a bitter expression at those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do we need to pay with?\u201d</p><br/><p>The fairy shrugged as it spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat else. The crystals on you guys. Crystals. Just pay 30. Then it\u2019ll be a free pass.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Curses almost exploded out from their mouths.</p><br/><p>The sum total they had hunted in the past 3 days was 50.</p><br/><p>And there were only about 30 in their possession.</p><br/><p>But for them to pay 30 crystals in order to open a door.</p><br/><p>Which meant they had to hand over their lives too.</p><br/><p>The reason why they were able to plan things about while trying so hard was because they had a backup plan which came from the crystals.</p><br/><p>The , which was right above the Central Island, was shown on the Islands Map and was told to have even more opportunities than now.</p><br/><p>The reason why the name Central Island was given was because it was an island right below the Tower.</p><br/><p>And they, who had already gained a lot in the central island, could still look out for opportunities even if they go up with heavy losses.</p><br/><p>But if they lose the crystals then they would have to give up on all of those opportunities.</p><br/><p>And the fairy had told them clearly.</p><br/><p>That there were 3 doors.</p><br/><p>Which means there was a chance that they will get robbed 2 more times like this from now.</p><br/><p>Guktae struggled to maintain his expression and then spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there a way to pass without paying?\u201d</p><br/><p>The fairy nodded at those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cSimple. You need to kill the Gatekeeper.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Gatekeeper.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Gatekeeper.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as the fairy\u2019s words ended, a fearful vibration started to ring throughout the ground.</p><br/><p>The origin of the vibration was the door in front of them.</p><br/><p>Kadududuk.</p><br/><p>Udududuk.</p><br/><p>The hundreds of thousand if not millions of bones that had made up the door mixed and intertwined as it turned into something giant.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Wolf?\u201d</p><br/><p>Somebody spoke out in dismay as they saw the giant wolf that stretched 50m long from head to its tail.</p><br/><p>Grrrrrrrr.</p><br/><p>Though it was made of bones, there were blue flames burning from its eyes.</p><br/><p>And this was from 30m above them.</p><br/><p>It was only 30m on paper, it felt like a building was standing up and growling at them.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t even squeak like the weak skeletons.</p><br/><p>Since the number of bones that its body consisted of was too many to do so.</p><br/><p>The people made fearful expressions as they saw the giant black wolf made of bones that were polluted black.</p><br/><p>The fairy laughed as it saw those people.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere. There isn\u2019t a moon anymore right? If you aren\u2019t going to pay then you just need to walk beneath it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grrrrrr</p><br/><p>The people gulped their saliva as they gazed at the giant Wolf.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026How about giving 30 crystals?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. How are we going to\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>30 crystals.</p><br/><p>A number that could only be gained if they killed 30 demons.</p><br/><p>It actually looked as strong as 30 demons.</p><br/><p>And that was the problem.</p><br/><p>They had hunted 50 of them by killing them 8 or 9 at a time but 30 of them charging at them at once was of a different dimension.</p><br/><p>The Clan Lords made bitter expressions as they looked at each other.</p><br/><p>There weren\u2019t any crystals on the few remaining non-clansmen.</p><br/><p>Which meant that they had to pay 30 crystals.</p><br/><p>No, another person did exist.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t have as much as them but someone in possession of a lot of crystals.</p><br/><p>They looked at Hansoo as they spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s pay the crystals together.\u201d</p><br/><p>That thing was too burdensome no matter what.</p><br/><p>Hansoo shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need to fight it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026what?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s expressions froze.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn\u2026 does he mean it\u2019s not worth it.\u2019</p><br/><p>Guktae frowned inwardly.</p><br/><p>But it made sense that it wasn\u2019t worth it.</p><br/><p>They were 1200.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, he was alone.</p><br/><p>It was possible that he would feel wronged if he had to burden part of the 30.</p><br/><p>But they couldn\u2019t act recklessly.</p><br/><p>The situation would become very complicated if he decides to go up when they try to force him with strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t telling you to pay all 30. Just a part of it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo thought quietly inwardly while listen to those words.</p><br/><p>\u2018Eres. I really think you are extremely amazing.\u2019</p><br/><p>Eres had saved 600 out of 1000 people and ascended.</p><br/><p>Surprisingly, Eres managed to have less than 30 deaths before they reached the Door of Bones.</p><br/><p>The thousand people Eres had numbered a little less but were much more formidable than the ones here.</p><br/><p>Like steel which got stronger as you hammered it, people who were strengthened from 20 days of fighting without rest.</p><br/><p>They had good synergy, kept on fighting against the demons and continuously reinforced their Battle Power from crystals.</p><br/><p>And the only action that Eres had regretted in the central island.</p><br/><p>Eres was scared of people dying while fighting that giant thing so she had paid the crystals she had gathered to pass it.</p><br/><p>And because of this, she had to pay crystals on the next gateway too.</p><br/><p>Since she had already given the crystals once and could not reinforce their battle powers with those crystals.</p><br/><p>And the same with the next gateway as well.</p><br/><p>And after she had arrived at the Giant Crystal at the Demon Lord\u2019s Castle at that pace, she had lost 400 out of 1000 people during the final battle.</p><br/><p>No, It ended with 400 because of luck.</p><br/><p>If they pass through something sweetly once in this world, then it\u2019ll just come back with interest and Eres had felt this through pain in her bones.</p><br/><p>\u2018It seems like I\u2019ll need to make some extra explanations.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo mumbled inwardly as he saw everyone\u2019s frozen expressions.</p><br/><p>KobatoChan\u2019s Note</p><br/><p>The Reincarnator\u2019s \u201cRegular\u201d chapters are scheduled for the Wednesday, Friday, Sunday and/or Saturday.

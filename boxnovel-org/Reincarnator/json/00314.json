Let\u2019s meet that man, first.\u2019</p><br/><p>He focused on the reason why he\u2019d come here.</p><br/><p>He was easy to locate with his newly heightened senses.</p><br/><p>\u2018...I just need to go in this direction, but should I really do it?\u2019</p><br/><p>If the man who had given him this strength had won, there would be no issues.</p><br/><p>But what if the Dark King won?</p><br/><p>Though he\u2019d become strong, he was nowhere near the level of causing a scene like this.</p><br/><p>He started to lose confidence.</p><br/><p>\u2018The Dark King might be perfectly fine\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>He sensed that one of them had a much more powerful aura, and sadly, its owner seemed to be the Dark King.</p><br/><p>Taesang pondered for a moment, and then decided to retreat.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yeah, I\u2019m not ready yet.\u2019</p><br/><p>He possessed unlimited potential.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t want to waste this new opportunity by dying.</p><br/><p>He also had comrades.</p><br/><p>If he met the enraged Dark King after heading into that place, then it would be a worthless death.</p><br/><p>But as he was about to retreat\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2026chhh\u2026chchch...</p><br/><p>\u2014in the distance.</p><br/><p>From where he was now heading towards.</p><br/><p>A vicious aura was seeping out.</p><br/><p>A terrifying aura that made him feel goosebumps all over.</p><br/><p>An aura that penetrated deep into his body and mind.</p><br/><p>He had felt this before.</p><br/><p>Twice actually.</p><br/><p>\u2018...my god. He won.\u2019</p><br/><p>Taesang gulped.</p><br/><p>This was the same aura as before.</p><br/><p>The aura he\u2019d felt when he\u2019d first met that man and had tried to resist.</p><br/><p>And when the man released his aura in the storage area.</p><br/><p>\u2018...it\u2019s that red light.\u2019</p><br/><p>When Misun had tried to resist.</p><br/><p>And when he was finding a candidate to become the transcendent.</p><br/><p>A terrifying aura radiated out from the man\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>And that aura was the same as what he was feeling right now.</p><br/><p>There was only one reason why he would be able to feel this aura.</p><br/><p>It meant that the man had won.</p><br/><p>Though the threat of the Dark King was gone, Taesang\u2019s worries did not.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn...should I have just run away?\u2019</p><br/><p>The vicious aura kept striking the surface of his skin.</p><br/><p>To the point of making him think that the Dark King might\u2019ve been better.</p><br/><p>Taesang pondered if he should continue or not, but soon shook his head.</p><br/><p>If that man wanted him dead, he would\u2019ve been killed already.</p><br/><p>And he had told him to come after digesting this new strength.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t dare go against those words.</p><br/><p>\u2018...f*** it, I\u2019ll go. Who knows, right? He might give me more gifts.\u2019</p><br/><p>Taesang thought positively as he dashed towards the origin of the vicious aura.</p><br/><p>And soon. </p><br/><p>A scene unfolded before his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2014shshshshsh\u2014 </p><br/><p>Dark red smoke was coming out from the man\u2019s eyes and into the seven orifices of the Dark King, who was kneeling on the ground before the man.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Taesang exclaimed out loud when he saw this scene.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201cUghh\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know, I pondered for a long time about how to use you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Dark King grit his teeth while resisting the blood-colored smoke that was invading his body.</p><br/><p>\u2018...Damn it! Just kill me!\u2019</p><br/><p>But he could not speak those words.</p><br/><p>The blood-colored smoke entering his body felt like it was gnawing away at his insides.</p><br/><p>Hansoo continued:</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen a transcendent is born...it is hard to be a righteous person. It\u2019s not a bad thing to become evil. It\u2019s actually quite normal.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was hard to survive alone, so groups were naturally formed.</p><br/><p>Since maintaining the group was the only way to survive, they made rules and laws for everyone to abide by.</p><br/><p>They respected each other since they needed each other.</p><br/><p>Even if one made another unhappy, they held back for the greater good of the group.</p><br/><p>That was the only way.</p><br/><p>If they fought the minute they disliked something, a group would never have been made in the first place.</p><br/><p>But a transcendent realizes the moment that they are born that they can escape from those bindings.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose with strength can easily become childish. Like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUghh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Transcendents were different from humans.</p><br/><p>Maybe because they were born anew, they acted like babies.</p><br/><p>So at first, they would carefully and slowly experiment.</p><br/><p>They would test how their newfound strength impacted their surroundings, then wait for feedback.</p><br/><p>And surprisingly.</p><br/><p>There was no resistance.</p><br/><p>Even if a transcendent did something to make the other party unhappy, they did nothing to harm him.</p><br/><p>Social bindings?</p><br/><p>Laughable.</p><br/><p>This is the main point that all transcendents will eventually realize.</p><br/><p>Even if their relationships worsened or crumbled apart, the result was the same.</p><br/><p>Because they had become a transcendent, all their relationships would change.</p><br/><p>The people they had fought with so far were no longer comrades, they were merely weights holding them back.</p><br/><p>Since the transcendents were that much more powerful.</p><br/><p>At this point, greed rises up inside one\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>Since I\u2019m working this hard to protect you, shouldn\u2019t you return the favor?</p><br/><p>And this mindset slowly changes.</p><br/><p>From a feeling of want to a desire.</p><br/><p>And everyone around the transcendent, as well as the transcendent themselves, start to realize.</p><br/><p>That one side had to fear the other.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo continued to speak towards the Dark King in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was thinking about whether I should take you or not. But I feel like I should at least make one before I go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once he unifies and colonizes the 4th zone, the number of people coming up through the elevator will rise, as well as the number of new transcendents being born.</p><br/><p>Without a figure to fear, chaos would reign once again.</p><br/><p>Those cancer-creating bastards were all settled in the west, and his comrades were fighting against them with their lives on the line.</p><br/><p>Hansoo did not have time to oversee the others, nor could he afford the potential casualties.</p><br/><p>So he needed to make one.</p><br/><p>A symbol of fear.</p><br/><p>He needed to show them.</p><br/><p>Show them what would happen if they thrashed about just because they\u2019d acquired power.</p><br/><p>\u2018Look closely.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo muttered, looking at Taesang.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014crunch\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u201cAhh...AHHHHHH!!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>A tremendous scream of pain and misery roared out from the mouth of the Dark King.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201cKUAAAAAAAAA!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Taesang looked in horror at the scene.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just the screaming.</p><br/><p>\u201cAHH!...AHHHH!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was so painful that the Dark King was screaming while rolling around on the ground.</p><br/><p>While all his limbs were smashed apart and his muscles had been shredded.</p><br/><p>\u2018What the f***\u2026 What did he do!?\u2019</p><br/><p>Taesang frowned.</p><br/><p>With a body like that, even lying down would still be painful.</p><br/><p>And even more so if one rolled around like that.</p><br/><p>But the Dark King didn\u2019t seem to be bothered by that, as he literally thrashed around while he howled.</p><br/><p>\u2014boom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014booom!\u2014 </p><br/><p>The Dark King\u2019s transcendent body caused the surrounding rubble to break apart.</p><br/><p>And then the man approached the Dark King, whispering something into his ears.</p><br/><p>\u2018...what did he say to him?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh...AHH!\u201d</p><br/><p>And then shockingly\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u2014the Dark King clenched his teeth and stood up, wearing a horrible expression filled with pain and misery.</p><br/><p>With a hint of hope mixed in.</p><br/><p>Then\u2014 </p><br/><p>\u201cAhhhh!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Dark King stumbled as he started to move.</p><br/><p>Towards the Kang-Kions in the distance.</p><br/><p>This scene caused Taesang to feel sorry for the Dark King, despite the horrible things he\u2019d done.</p><br/><p>Hansoo slowly approached Taesang.</p><br/><p>\u201c...what did you do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo replied with a laugh as he looked at the Dark King dashing away, screaming as he did so.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

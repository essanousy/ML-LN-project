Tsk. Some bad fate.\u2019</p><br/><p>Bali Roper thought of the incident in the past.</p><br/><p>He had met that guy, his wife and his daughter 4 years ago.</p><br/><p>There aren\u2019t many who travel with their family in the Otherworld.</p><br/><p>And those who came together in the beginning and had even climbed up to the Orange Zone could be counted on one\u2019s fingers.</p><br/><p>It was one of two incidents.</p><br/><p>One of the family members was so abnormally strong that they could protect the other members despite them being weak.</p><br/><p>Enbi Arin, a powerhouse of the Orange Zone, was like this.</p><br/><p>Or that all of the members were decently strong.</p><br/><p>Gwanje\u2019s family were the latter.</p><br/><p>And because of this they couldn\u2019t win over Bali Roper.</p><br/><p>Though Gwanje, his daughter and his wife were quite strong, they were just at the level of those who came up from the Red Zone.</p><br/><p>Though Gwanje was almost at the Baladi level, he himself was one of the strongest out of the Baladi levels and these three mediocre ones couldn\u2019t go against him.</p><br/><p>He was extremely happy when he first found Gwanje and his family.</p><br/><p>One of Bali Roper\u2019s favorite actions was playing around with another family member in front of them.</p><br/><p>Finding such a family was like plucking stars from the heavens but for him to bring both his wife and his daughter, how could Bali Roper not be excited?</p><br/><p>And as if he\u2019d married early, the fact that his wife was still attractive made him quite happy.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn. I should\u2019ve killed him back then.\u2019</p><br/><p>Bali Roper frowned.</p><br/><p>The place where he had lost him was this place.</p><br/><p>Though Bali had caught the daughter, Gwanje had taken his wife and fell into this giant Reflux Organ.</p><br/><p>\u2018I shouldn\u2019t have killed his daughter as a mean of anger relief back then.\u2019</p><br/><p>Who would\u2019ve known that the guy who had come back would\u2019ve become such a monster?</p><br/><p>The guy who was barely at the Baladi level came back as a Margoth level.</p><br/><p>He then used that strength and the lure and hope of the body enhancement surgery in order to madly increase his influence and power.</p><br/><p>Their growth was but instant.</p><br/><p>Gwanje seemed like he didn\u2019t care much about managing the clan, he just took people in as long as they were strong.</p><br/><p>The reason why they had let in Kale Dawson, who was being chased by Enbi Arin, was a tactic as well.</p><br/><p>Since the decision of taking Kale Dawson in while neglecting the possibility of clashing with Enbi Arin was very tempting to those in the Orange Zone who had created enemies everywhere.</p><br/><p>In conclusion, all the people who were strong but couldn\u2019t join a clan and receive their protection because they were such a mess of a character had been recruited into the Rerorerore clan.</p><br/><p>This was the moment where a group consisting of the worst possible individuals had been created.</p><br/><p>The Rerorerore clan, which had instantly caught up to the clan Eres and Keldian had created, the , became an object of caution to other clans in a moment.</p><br/><p>If he himself hadn\u2019t become stronger, gotten to the Margoth level and hadn\u2019t gone into the Crown Clan who were against the Rerorerore clan quickly expanding and recruiting in strong people then he would\u2019ve been ripped apart.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tsk. To meet in a place like this.\u2019</p><br/><p>Margoths were charging in from all directions.</p><br/><p>But there was no need to fight with the Margoths here.</p><br/><p>Though Gwanje had brought the Margoths here, they could also just back off.</p><br/><p>They might receive some damage while backing off but those who should worry about this were the weaker ones and not himself.</p><br/><p>\u2018If Hansoo has some sense then he wouldn\u2019t throw me away here either.\u2019</p><br/><p>Bali Roper frowned after looking around his surroundings with leisure.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026But wouldn\u2019t be we able to kill that guy this time?\u2019</p><br/><p>As he\u2019d been penetrated by the horn upon the Margoth\u2019s head, Bali roper looked at Gwanje who had a giant hole on his side and muttered inwardly.</p><br/><p>Actually Gwanje was like fear itself even in Bali Roper\u2019s perspective.</p><br/><p>That strength, that tenacity and that resourcefulness.</p><br/><p>If such a guy was alive then he wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep at night in peace.</p><br/><p>He had to kill the guy who was always looking for a chance to kill him instead no matter what so he had targeted the Akarons.</p><br/><p>Since combining the strength of the Akarons along with their clan would mean that they would have the strength to smash apart the Rerorerore clan.</p><br/><p>\u2018Though everything went to shit\u2026 Isn\u2019t this a chance?\u2019</p><br/><p>Bali Roper stole a glance at Hansoo.</p><br/><p>The best instance would be the guy next to him and Gwanje in the distance all dying together.</p><br/><p>At this rate he will eventually be killed under Gwanje\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>Since Gwanje had been slowly getting to him for the past 4 years.</p><br/><p>Though he wanted to get to the Yellow Zone but once he tried to do this Gwanje would block his path even if he had to go on a war against him.</p><br/><p>It was a crazy act in Bali Roper\u2019s perspective since he had to cross over the Rerorerore clan\u2019s territory in order to get to the portal to the Yellow Zone.</p><br/><p>\u2018But this is quite worth risking a bit of danger.\u2019</p><br/><p>Bali Roper took out and grasped the small necklace that he had saved for an unknown situation after finishing off his thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked at the guy in the distance while preparing to back off.</p><br/><p>\u2018It seems like that guy is the leader of the Rerorerore clan. Did he lure them over here himself?\u2019</p><br/><p>Kim Gwanje.</p><br/><p>Though it seemed like he had received quite a large injury, that injury was healing at a visible pace.</p><br/><p>\u2018So he received the body enhancement surgery as well. I wasn\u2019t the first huh.\u2019</p><br/><p>The Margoth\u2019s eyes were not targeted on Gwanje who had lured them but at Hansoo and his group who were swarming around in the distance.</p><br/><p>Margoth Du Capucio.</p><br/><p>They were smaller than the giant Margoths with a herbivore\u2019s physique, the Margoth Du Graesios.</p><br/><p>Just about 1km.</p><br/><p>Since they were a bit weaker than the Graesios, a normal Margoth level adventurer could kill around two of them.</p><br/><p>But they were much more dangerous to humans since they had a much worse temper and will kill even if they couldn\u2019t eat them if they felt danger.</p><br/><p>Actually around one Margoth level person would get shredded apart after going into their territory without realizing it and get hunted down by their group hunts.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tsk. To bring 20 of them.\u2019</p><br/><p>Though he might be able to beat them with the new power of the Nurmaha\u2019s ring he had obtained on the way up to the Orange Zone and the power of those behind him but the damage will be substantial.</p><br/><p>\u2018But if he doesn\u2019t bother to plug this place up then there\u2019s no reason to fight.\u2019</p><br/><p>Then he didn\u2019t have anything to do with that guy.</p><br/><p>Though there wasn\u2019t anything bad about killing him but it\u2019ll be dangerous if they go too far while the Margoths are on a rampage.</p><br/><p>Hansoo made the decision to back off here and help the Akarons as he spread the scent behind him and tried to back off.</p><br/><p>\u2018It doesn\u2019t seem like he brought them here to massacre us anyway.\u2019</p><br/><p>Kuaaaaaaaaaak!</p><br/><p>Though the Margoths were madly charging at them, there was a limit to how many can come in at a time due to the structure of the ant tunnels.</p><br/><p>Though there might be small amounts of damage, they would be able to back off.</p><br/><p>Hansoo looked at the Margoth Du Capucios making huge noises as they ran towards the cave that housed the Reflux Organ and gathered mana onto his hands.</p><br/><p>At the same time the most fatal pore of the Pandemic Blade started to gather up at the end of Forked Lightning.</p><br/><p>Hansoo then used the Demonic Dragon\u2019s Reinforcement onto the already enhanced body and whipped the spear out.</p><br/><p>Booooom!</p><br/><p>The Capucio that was charging at them started to shake its head.</p><br/><p>Kyaaaaak!</p><br/><p>The Capucio shook its head from the pain of the skin around its head burning up and then fell, smashed down to the side of the inner walls of the Gragos as if it had become dizzy.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s working.\u2019</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t put in that much mana onto the Pandemic Blade.</p><br/><p>The thing he had put more mana into was something else.</p><br/><p>Nurmaha\u2019s ring.</p><br/><p>The third power after Power Destruction and Hemorrhage.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>Kuuuuu</p><br/><p>The giant Margoth Du Capucio smashed its head against the wall as if it was feeling extremely stuffy.</p><br/><p>No, it even staggered as it crashed onto the other Margoth Du Capucio running next to it.</p><br/><p>Kyaaaak!</p><br/><p>As he saw the row of Margoth instantly being smashed apart, Bali Roper made an annoyed expression.</p><br/><p>\u2018That\u2019s really unfair. Where the hell did he get something like that?\u2019</p><br/><p>Bali Roper thought of when he had been caught by Hansoo.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that one got blind or turned deaf after getting hit by it.</p><br/><p>But it was much more annoying.</p><br/><p>Their eyesight which allowed them to see objects that were kilometers away.</p><br/><p>It suppressed their perception rune that was the basis of that and even messed with their balance.</p><br/><p>And of course such a thing was fatal in a battle where they had to fight madly with all five of the senses being honed on the battle.</p><br/><p>The things over there would feel the same thing at this moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? Let\u2019s hurry and get out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hansoo spoke as he looked to the side.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that they would turn into half of a retard after getting hit once.</p><br/><p>It took more mana the more effective it was and the duration wasn\u2019t that long.</p><br/><p>Bali Roper made a sad expression at those words and then shook his necklace a few more times.</p><br/><p>\u2018Did he not see it?\u2019</p><br/><p>This was all he could do since he couldn\u2019t provoke Gwanje openly when Hansoo was looking at him.</p><br/><p>Bali Roper looked at Gwanje who was looking at his direction with a glare.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u2018To have to send him off. Hoo\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Gwanje looked at Bali Roper in the distance with a neutral expression.</p><br/><p>Though he wanted to rip that guy apart, he had no way of killing him since he had hidden deep within the Crown Clan.</p><br/><p>Though he didn\u2019t know why that guy had come here today but this was a great chance to kill a guy who had climbed up after hiding in the clan for so long.</p><br/><p>But Gwanje shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s too much.\u2019</p><br/><p>He could probably do it.</p><br/><p>But in order to kill that guy he would need to charge in, hold them down and lure the Margoths to crash into them.</p><br/><p>The next stage was too important for him to risk so much danger.</p><br/><p>Since the guys, who already didn\u2019t listen to him, would be impossible to control if he didn\u2019t exist.</p><br/><p>He had to quickly finish off here, regroup with the Ursa Major members he had already sent off and focus on the work at the next location.</p><br/><p>\u2018Since these guys don\u2019t even listen to the leader that well already.\u2019</p><br/><p>Rerorerore clan.</p><br/><p>A chaotic clan full of screwed up people.</p><br/><p>The pinnacle of this example was the Ursa Major.</p><br/><p>The Ursa Major members had only joined under Gwanje for profit.</p><br/><p>Of course they wouldn\u2019t participate in such a dangerous work like this.</p><br/><p>There was a reason why Gwanje, the clan leader, had to lure the Margoths himself.</p><br/><p>\u2018Though I wanted to give them a small gift but\u2026 Is the guy next to him Hansoo? Damn. It wouldn\u2019t even count as a small gift.\u2019</p><br/><p>He thought that he would be able to kill at least a third of them but the Crown clan was safely backing off due to the guy who threw the booming golden spear in the distance.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ll let you live a bit longer.\u2019</p><br/><p>If things go according to his plan, that guy wouldn\u2019t be able to survive anyway.</p><br/><p>The moment Gwanje looked back at Bali Roper with a regretful expression, something got caught in his eyes.</p><br/><p>His eyes which had been enhanced to supernatural levels allowed him to identify the thing that was shaking back and forth on his neck.</p><br/><p>Gwanje made an expression of despair as he saw this.</p><br/><p>\u2018Huh\u2026 My daughter\u2019s necklace? He had it.\u2019</p><br/><p>The necklace which he couldn\u2019t find despite searching for hours from the corpse of his daughter.</p><br/><p>At that moment Gwanje felt something snap within his head.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u2018He saw it.\u2019</p><br/><p>Bali Roper made a content expression as he saw Gwanje\u2019s expression.</p><br/><p>But Roper couldn\u2019t see it because he was focused on Gwanje.</p><br/><p>That Hansoo was glaring at him from his back.</p><br/><p>\u2018I wondered who had sinned against that guy, it was this guy huh.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hansoo laughed coldly.</p><br/><p>Proofreader\u2019s note</p><br/><p>Regular chapter 2/3.</p><br/><p>Twists and turns\u2026 Gwanje doesn\u2019t seem like this really bad guy anymore, although he\u2019s causing a lot of trouble for the Akarons who had helped him with the body enhancement surgery before. I wonder how he will end up.</p><br/><p>Has anyobody ever thought of starting a Wikia for Reincarnator?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

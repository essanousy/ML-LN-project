It was the result of struggling on his own without eating anything for the last few days.</p><br/><p>\u201cHyung-nims\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Orca looked at Yulian and Pere before starting to speak, and then moved his gaze back to Librie as he walked toward her.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother. No matter what the reason was, this incident \u2026\u2026 you were at fault. But rather than asking for forgiveness, you want to curse them\u2026\u2026 Does it make you feel better if you pour out curses to my hyung-nims? Why do you keep hurting yourself like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOrca!\u201d</p><br/><p>Librie tightly hugged Orca and started to cry as she continued to call out his name.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was for you. I didn\u2019t want you to feel the same type of feeling I had been feeling.\u201d</p><br/><p>Orca hugged his mother and started to pat her back as he responded.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was quite happy. I had a mother who loves me like this, and two reliable hyung-nims. What would I have had to be anxious about? Mother, why did you try to take everything on by yourself? I was happy enough before all of this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Orca\u2019s eyes started to tear up as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cShould we die together? Since the reason was me, let us both die cleanly. Don\u2019t put your grudge on anybody and let\u2019s just die right here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOrca!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian and Pere were extremely shocked as they called out their younger brother\u2019s name.</p><br/><p>Orca turned his head while still hugging Librie to look at his two brothers.</p><br/><p>\u201cHyung-nims, please let her keep her life. Please have mercy on this poor mother and at least her life \u2026 please let her keep her life. This Orca will work extremely hard to bring great merits to the tribe to slowly cleanse away her sin, so please let her keep her life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOrca, you\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian was about to say something, but after seeing Orca\u2019s expression, he stopped talking.</p><br/><p>It was an expression he had never seen on his brother before. It was hard to believe that such expression was on the face of that pure and gentle brother of his.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe is still my mother. No matter how big her sin is, she gave birth to me and doted on me. I can\u2019t let her die in front of my eyes. If you must kill her, please kill me with her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOrca! We won\u2019t forgive you if you do anything unnecessary!\u201d</p><br/><p>Pere noticed the shining sosoonta in Orca\u2019s left wrist and urgently shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cWill you let her live?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPut that away right now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian also noticed the sosoonta and shouted toward Orca. Orca just took the sosoonta out and held it in his hand as he asked again.</p><br/><p>\u201cWill you let her live?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPut that down first and we can talk!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHyung-nim, even if I die, I cannot watch my mother be killed. Please promise me. I need a promise from the Glow\u2019s mouth.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian used his left arm to stop Pere from moving forward and reached out his right hand toward Orca.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will do my best. So please hand over that sosoonta.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is not enough. Even if hyung-nim says you\u2019ll let her live, Pere hyung-nim and the others will not forgive her. Please promise me that you will help defend her. Pere hyung-nim as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pere was extremely frustrated.</p><br/><p>He never expected their youngest brother to use such a method. He couldn\u2019t do anything about it. It\u2019s not like he could kill his only younger brother.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it, Orca. You are stabbing this hyung in the back. Fine! If you put down that sosoonta, I will promise not to care about this incident at all. I will not protect her from the others, but I will promise not to kill her myself. So put it down.\u201d</p><br/><p>Orca moved his eyes over to Yulian.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow I just need eldest hyung-nim\u2019s promise. Please promise me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOrca\u2026 you \u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian\u2019s body started to shake.</p><br/><p>But he couldn\u2019t lose his living brother for the sake of a dead person\u2019s revenge.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine. I will promise you. However, be prepared to handle the severe punishment for threatening me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once Yulian also gave his approval, Orca started to smile as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cHyung-nim, even if you say you will beat me to death, I will accept it with a smile. Thank you very much. Hyung-nims.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Orca put the sosoonta down, something nobody could have expected happened. That was why nobody could stop it. Nobody could stop the sosoonta Orca put down from ending up in Librie\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>Librie grabbed the sosoonta with her right hand and pushed Orca away with her left.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother!\u201d</p><br/><p>As Orca lifted himself up and tried to approach Librie, Librie quickly put the tip of the sosoonta at her neck.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother, why are you doing this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Orca was shouting at her, and Yulian and Pere just stood there watching her, not knowing what this woman was going to do next.</p><br/><p>\u201cOrca, as long as this mother of yours is alive, you will not be able to head out into the sun. What this mother of yours hopes for, is that you will confidently stand in front of the others and earn the respect and love of the tribe. I don\u2019t want you to become someone that nobody really knows or cares about.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMother!\u201d</p><br/><p>Orca shouted back at her, but Librie was now looking at Yulian and Pere.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt least you two brothers are willing to take good care of your youngest brother. You are different than your heartless father. To hold back when I know you all you want to do right now is to kill me. Fine, I will accept at least a part of what you just said. However, as long as I am alive, Orca will only be hated by the rest of the tribe. It\u2019ll only be better if I am dead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have already made a promise with Orca. Put down that sosoonta.\u201d</p><br/><p>Librie shook her head at Yulian\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I cannot do that. Being called the wife who killed her husband is enough. I will not also be called the mother who hindered her child\u2019s future. If you continue to take care of your brother like you just did, I will die without cursing you even a tiny bit. Rather, I will die while praying for your future days.\u201d</p><br/><p>Librie looked back at Orca.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother, why are you doing this? Everything has been resolved, so why are you doing something to stab another nail in your son\u2019s heart? Please PUT IT DOWN NOW!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy son. My wonderful son. Your mother will protect you even after death.\u201d</p><br/><p>Librie\u2019s hand moved.</p><br/><p>\u201cNO!\u201d</p><br/><p>Orca screamed as he rushed toward her, but Librie\u2019s neck was already spurting out a fountain of blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cAAAAH! Mother, why\u2026 just why would you do this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cO...rca...kuk...kuk\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>With wind going into her vocal chords, there was no way she could talk normally.</p><br/><p>But Librie used all of her strength to say one last thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cI \u2026 lo...ve you\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMother!\u201d</p><br/><p>Orca cried as he continued to shout. Yulian and Pere were just as shocked. They had never expected that woman to take her life like this.</p><br/><p>\u2018Wasn\u2019t she grovelling just a moment ago for us to not kill her? What must have been going through her mind?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing this mother and son like this, Yulian recalled the moment his mother had passed away. Only then did he start to slowly understand Librie\u2019s thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u2018In the end, she too was a mother \u2026\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Yulian and Pere both thought about their deceased mothers and started to becoming emotional thinking about the love their mothers showered them with while they were alive.</p><br/><p>The three brothers spent a long time in the paoe filled with grief and sorrow.</p><br/><p>____________________________________________________________________</p><br/><p>The chaos that shook Pareia disappeared quickly.</p><br/><p>The quick movements of the chiefs who had already pledged their loyalty to Yulian helped, as well as Grace leading the charge to restore the tribe\u2019s vigor.</p><br/><p>But most importantly, Yulian was already prepared to be the Glow.</p><br/><p>Year 253 of the Continental Calendar.</p><br/><p>The Desert Conqueror, Yulian Provoke, was officially proclaimed as the Glow of Pareia.</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 3.</p><br/><p>Next up:</p><br/><p><strong>First Campaign</strong></p><br/><p><i>The War God of the Eastern Desert had been foretold since a long time ago, but the birth of the War God of the Eastern Desert happened in an instant.</i></p><br/>\n</div>"}

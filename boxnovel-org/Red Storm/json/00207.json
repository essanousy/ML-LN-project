Once he did, Yulian nodded his head in response and looked toward them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Silence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Yulian did not like this type of atmosphere. The Red Storm were the ones who had been with the longest out of anyone. They had shared blood and sweat with him. However, just what was this awkward atmosphere?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cI believe you have a lot of things you want to say.

And I hate this type of atmosphere. In addition, I hate the type of atmosphere that makes it feel like we lost even though we won much more.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The warriors all picked up their heads at Yulian\u2019s response and lookedtoward him. Yulian continued to speak.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cWar is somewhere that we take the lives of others. However, it is somewhere we may lose our own lives as well. Was my judment wrong?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cYou are right. That is what war is about. We sweat and we bleed so that we can prevent ourselves from dying. So what is there for us to say?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Shubeon\u2019s voice definitely held some anger. However, he did not dare to show that anger in front of Yulian. He was their leader and Glow, and Yulian was also one of the warriors who put his life on the line to fight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was a problem everyone was aware of. They knew that to go to war meant to take someone else\u2019s life. However, they did not know how to deal with this situation and atmosphere in front of them. They were not used to losing one of their own; they were not used to losing a friend whose life was just as important as their own life.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cAll of you are amazing. I expected there to be some more sacrifices, but more of you survived than I expected.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The one to speak was of course Runa. All of the warriors turned to glare at him. Their expressions turned to surprise once they did.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Runa was over there bowing to them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cI will accept it. In the current continent, there are no other brigades that have the attack strength of the Red Storm. In addition, thank you for giving this Runa the approval to use that strength for our Pareia.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Yulian was also looking at Runa with shock. Runa\u2019s eyes were starting to turn red.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cI know that it was extremely difficult. I knew that there would be a lot of sacrifices even if we succeeded.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Shubeon clenched his fists and was about to rush forward but Thrint grabbed onto his clothes to prevent him. Once Shubeon turned his head to look at Thrint, Thrint shook his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Runa continued to speak.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cBut you must know this much. We definitely needed to take control of this gate for Pareia, and thousands of warriors would have had to shed their blood if we tried to take it using the normal strategies. That is why \u2026 I can stand tall as I look at you. That is why I do not regret my decision.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Runa stopped speaking and looked around at the warriors before continuing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cNo matter how many hundreds of times I ran through it in my head, that strategy was something the Red Storm could successfully complete. Didn\u2019t you tell me in the past? If it is for our dream, you would glady be my pawns. And that if I do not use you properly, that you would kill me. I will ask you this. Do you \u2026 wish that I act like a sinner in front of you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Shubeon\u2019s fist slowly started to open. All of the warriors who were glaring at him turned away. Wasn\u2019t this something all of them knew? They all knew it was something only they could successfully accomplish. They may be sad, but there was no need to be angry.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Their sacrifice saved their nation and the lives of thousands of warriors. They knew about it even before the mission started.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After a long moment of silence, Thrint finally started to speak.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cAssistant Warrior Runa, what you said is correct. You just used our strength and fame for a job that was fitting. Yes \u2026 it is better than being used for something that is not fitting for our strength. Please continue to use us properly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cEveryone, get rid of your frowns. We have won. In order to show our respects for our friends that have gone before us, let us not blame ourselves.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Everyone nodded at Haisha\u2019s words and look around at each other and started to smile. Although it was a forced smile, this was the time to smile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cGlow, we apologize for causing you so much headache.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As Haisha approached and bowed, Yulian shook his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right now, Yulian was feeling overwhelmed by Runa\u2019s words and the warriors\u2019 words. These amazing warriors were his subordinates.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cShubeon, it\u2019s all your fault. I couldn\u2019t say anything because it might cause you to go off again.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As one of the warriors jokingly answered, Shubeon started to smile as he responded.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cDamn it, I know, I know, but i just couldn\u2019t say anything because i felt sorry for the bastards that left before us.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u2018Is this enough to resolve things for now?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Shubeon thought that to himself while looking at the now smiling Glow and Red Storm warriors.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u2018This is why I like all of them.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Runa wanted to be involved in the conversation as well for a moment, but in the end, shook his head and sneaked out of them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"></span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Silence Empire was obvious, but even the Rojini Kingdom started go wild at the fact that Pareia had conquered Henkel Gate.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">First of all, the Silence Empire became completely shocked at this surprising news. The Henkel Gate that they had considered to be completely safe had fallen, which meant that the other half of Henkel Plains was no longer safe either.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Most importantly, the death of Master Spotch was really unexpected.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Spotch had ranked in the upper echlon of the Empire\u2019s masters, yet he was unable to defend against a single barbarian tribe and died.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Silence Empire quickly entered a state of emergency. They quickly sent reinforcements to the Mobile region, while gathering people for strategy meetings that lasted for days.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">During the meeting, there were many discussions internally among the Silence Empire that they needed to send an envoy to Pareia to call for an armistice. Of course they were careful about bringing it up to not anger their royal hgihness. The reason they were pushing for an armistice was because they did not have many units to move to the back as they were in a fierce battle with the Rojini Kingdom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Crown Prince Shaone had no choice but to send a diplomatic envoy to Pareia, while putting their plan for the Mobile region at the forefront of their discussions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">On the other hand, the Rojini Kingdom was extremely excited. Although they did not originally expect much from Pareia, Pareia had taken victory after victory to significantly oppress the Silence Empire. To be honest, the Rojini Kingdom never expected Pareia to be this great of an ally.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Some of the nobles had even complained about what kind of help the barbarians could give them, indicating that they didn\u2019t need Pareia\u2019s help to start. Surprisngly, Master Aizen and Master Winnie had pushd them to create the alliance with Pareia.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was because of the two of their level of respect that they had given such a significant amount of materials to Pareia. But now, the situation had turned 180 degrees. They wanted to create an embassy in Pareia, and create an embassy for Pareia in the Rojini Kingdom as well. That way, they could always share opinions with each other and create a path of communication.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They also needed to create a diplomat who would focus all of their time on Pareia, while making sure to increase the level of support for Pareia. Basically, they needed to do whatever they could to keep this alliance strong.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Rojini Kingdom\u2019s emperor Finn Rojini III agreed with all of these suggestions and ordered an envoy to be sent to Pareia to discuss everything.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

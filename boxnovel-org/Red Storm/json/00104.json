I know very well that you are having a tough time. But you must not forget why were are all out here! We are here to make our territory larger and bring more people into our tribe so that we can step away from the influence of the strong forces of the continent. We cannot forget that we are here to make our lives better!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOowaaaaaaaa~!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecome strong. Do not die. Shouldn\u2019t you at least see what kind of person your Glow is? Shouldn\u2019t you be here to see the changed desert? Shouldn\u2019t we get out of the current situation where all men become warriors to kill or be killed? I will show you the strength of our Pareia. Look at the strength of the warriors who are about to reach the pinnacle. And follow them. Today, I will show you the goal you should be aiming for.\u201d</p><br/><p>All of the warriors could feel their hearts pounding at Yulian\u2019s loud voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cRed Storm, are you ready?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOowoooooo~!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou may all be allies, but this is a competition. Do your best. Treat the enemy\u2019s wooden sword as a real sword, and if you feel like you have received a hit that would leave you unable to continue in a real battle, step away. That is the only way to have a fair and just battle.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOowoooooo~!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Red Storm warriors looked over their t-shirt shaped leather armor and their wooden swords.</p><br/><p>If they were using their greatswords, these armors would be useless, but since it was a mock battle, they made sure to put them on. It was possible to get a broken bone with a wooden sword, so the armors were there to help prevent any injuries.</p><br/><p>In the middle of the audience of warriors, Red Storm divided into two groups and set up their formations.</p><br/><p>\u201cStart the competition!\u201d</p><br/><p>With Yulian starting the competition, the two formations of Red Storm warriors quickly ran forward.</p><br/><p>Running strength played a large part even in smaller scale battles. And when you are in a battle like this where you are very clear about your opponent\u2019s strength, you needed to take even the slightest terrain advantages you could get.</p><br/><p>\u201cOowaaaaaaa~!\u201d</p><br/><p>The warriors in the audience started to cheer. They were finally getting the see the might of the Red Storm that they had not been able to see clearly until now.</p><br/><p>Clack! Clack! Clack!</p><br/><p>They could instantly start to hear the sound of wooden swords clashing. There were even instances of wooden swords breaking from the first clashes.</p><br/><p>\u201cSquash them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFlip them over and kill them!\u201d</p><br/><p>There were rough words being said in multiple places that it was hard to tell if they really were fellow warriors.</p><br/><p>The Red Storm warriors all had higher levels of pride and competitive spirit compared to most warriors. That personality was the reason they selected to join the Red Storm in the first place, and it was what kept them going even when Yulian was mocking them and putting them down.</p><br/><p>Although they were on the same side, the moment a competition begins, they were the enemy.</p><br/><p>As wooden swords started to break and people started to fall of their pirmas, they started to fight with their fists.</p><br/><p>The Red Storm warriors\u2019 surprising strengths made the other warriors drop their jaws, and some of them even questioned whether they had to go that far, making each other bleed and shout out in pain. Even though it was a competition, they were still fellow comrades.</p><br/><p>Some of them started to be eliminated one or two at a time, and at the end, everyone was down on the ground heavily breathing. There were even a few warriors who had ended up fainting.</p><br/><p>Yulian started to shout after seeing them in that state.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake a close look. This is the Red Storm. They were able to stay alive because they have worked hard and become stronger. Even 20,000 Wikaly warriors could not stop them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since this was all set up to prevent the morale from falling and bring up the warriors\u2019 passion, Yulian started to say things that would light a fire in the hearts of the warriors.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will ask you this. Do you think you can take on the Red Storm? I hope you aren\u2019t scared, are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The warriors started to get angry in their hearts. They saw the strength of the Red Storm warriors with their own eyes, but they felt that if it was them, they would not let a mere 60 warriors get away from them.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think I am speaking nonsense right now? If you can\u2019t even get past the Red Storm warriors, do you still think that you are strong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Their commander was suspicious about their abilities. There was no greater mockery than this.</p><br/><p>And Pareia\u2019s warriors were not calm enough to just take such mockery quietly. After all, these were the warriors who never lost their will to fight even in the long wars against the Shuarei.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will kill the Wikaly. And we will make the Glow apologize for making such remarks.\u201d</p><br/><p>Egane saw the expressions on the faces of the warriors and quickly stepped forward. It was because he realized the purpose of this show today.</p><br/><p>Egane continued to show in a loud voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t this make all of you angry?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The warriors all turned their gazes to Egane.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur Glow is doubting our strengths. I am extremely frustrated at that. I will show him. I will show him my strength. Are you all just going to sit back and let him continue to doubt?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOooooooooooooooo~!\u201d</p><br/><p>The warriors started to shout in one voice. All of their gazes turned toward Yulian. It was as if they were asking him to give them a chance to fight.</p><br/><p>Yulian stepped it up and continued to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you show the same amount of courage that the Red Storm has shown, I will believe you. But I will not believe the warriors who have expressions full of fatigue as you do right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOoooooo~!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShow me with your actions. Your time will come soon. Our warriors have taken over two of the Wikaly\u2019s central oases. They will cut off the enemy\u2019s supply line. If we are continued to be pushed back even in such a situation, doesn\u2019t it mean that we have lost?\u201d</p><br/><p>The warriors hesitated for a moment, not sure whether they should cheer or rag on Yulian.</p><br/><p>The warriors knew as well. They knew what it was like to get your supply line cut off and to be pressured from the back.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s win. Your Glow will always lead from the front. All you need to do is follow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOowwaaaaaaaaa~!\u201d</p><br/><p>The warriors started to cheer once more.</p><br/><p>As Egane approached him, Yulian whispered in a quiet voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making me into the bad guy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you make up your mind to be the bad guy before saying all of those things? If you\u2019re going to do it, might as well do it right. That was why I gave you some help.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess all of their anger will be directed toward me for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHohoho, in return, their morale should not fall any further.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at the smirk on Egane\u2019s face, Yulian ended up smiling as well. No matter what, things ended up the way he wanted it to go.</p><br/><p>Yulian and Egane both turned their heads toward the Wikaly oasis at the same time.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>The Wikaly meeting of Greatest Warriors had currently continued a marathon meeting of six hours because of Runa\u2019s last suggestion.</p><br/><p>\u201cRemove 10,000?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Abham-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>Many of the Greatest Warriors disagreed with Runa\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are able to persist because of the prepared defenses as well as the numbers advantage. If you remove 10,000 from here, we will not be able to last.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI do not understand why the person who said we should avoid a dangerous field battle is now saying we should remove 10,000 warriors.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Pareia attacks us while those 10,000 are secretly moving behind them, we may end up in a very dangerous situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Abham lifted up his hand to stop the discussion and asked Runa a question.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to know what you are thinking.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have already lost two of our central oases and the enemy is already preparing their defenses for those oases. We can\u2019t just sit back and watch like this, can we?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everybody agreed with this much. Wasn\u2019t that why they had discussed retreating from here to merge with the warriors in the center?</p><br/><p>But it was Runa who was completely against that idea, which was why they were even more confused about Runa\u2019s suggestion.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if we retreat from here and merge with the warriors in the center to pressure Pareia, it is possible that we will end up being pressured from both sides. It is possible for us to leave the minimum number of warriors here to defend, but the question becomes whether they can prevent the Pareia warriors in front of us from getting past them. Is there anybody here who is confident that they can successfully defend with 10,000 warriors?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Greatest Warriors could only turn red and let out some fake coughs at Runa\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>They were not confident. They had to put aside their pride and make an unbiased opinion about it because if they ended up losing 10,000 warriors for no reason, that would really be the end of the Wikaly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can confidently say that I would be able to defend with 10,000 warriors, but how quickly can you take back the central oases with the remaining warriors? If you cannot take it back within 3 months, Pareia will send reinforcements even if it puts them in danger elsewhere. Time has not been on our side since Pareia took over the central oases.\u201d</p><br/><p>Runa had determined that they would not be able to take back the central oases quickly.</p><br/><p>Pareia\u2019s warriors had defended their oases against that Venersis for over 10 years. Their defense really was flawless. That was why he has been thinking that he needed to be the one to go.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight now, Pareia knows that time is on their side, but their morale has to be falling. We need to use that to our advantage to hit Pareia with everything we have, before retreating and taking back the central oases. In order to do that, we need to send 10,000 warriors to move behind them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWill they just sit back and watch us do that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe enemy does not know where we will move from, so if we make some movements, their focus will be directed to the oasis. As long as the enemy is not dumb, they will know that they cannot win in a battle where the enemy has 10,000 more warriors than they do. They will plan some kind of scheme to help them. If you head about half a day past Pareia\u2019s current location, there is a location that would allow them to launch such a scheme. All we have to do is ambush them when they get there.\u201d</p><br/><p>The eyes of the Greatest Warriors started to sparkle. Runa\u2019s plan had a decent chance for success.</p><br/><p>:Amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the Greatest Warriors gave Runa a thumbs up as he said that, and Runa started to smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cAbham-nim and I have been preparing for a war against Pareia for many years now. Can\u2019t you tell based on the amount of food that is currently stored in the oasis? Everything around the oasis is already in my head, so this much is nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa! Abham-nim, you really have an amazing lead warrior. I also cannot stop admiring your foresight to have prepared for this war far in advance.\u201d</p><br/><p>At the other Greatest Warrior\u2019s praise, Abham let out a laugh as he answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cKekeke, everything came out of Runa\u2019s head. We suffered quite a bit to prepare, but I did not expect it to be used like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>As the atmosphere in the paoe turned better, Runa started to speak once more.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you will allow me, I will like to personally escort the Greatest Warrior there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. We will do as you say. Then what should the rest of us do at the oasis?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease start to make it look like you are preparing to face them head on. If you do that for a couple of days, Pareia\u2019s Greatest Warriors are wise and will not want to engage in a disadvantageous battle. As a result, they will perfectly fall for our trap.\u201d</p><br/><p>Runa\u2019s true feelings could slightly be seen. He was blaming the Wikaly Greatest Warriors for being a bit useless. But nobody seemed to have noticed that as they were still happily chatting with each other.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s not surprising. Our Wikaly has been peaceful for too long while Pareia has constantly been at war.\u2019</p><br/><p>Runa was shaking his head internally as he had a bitter smile on his face.</p><br/><p>Become a patron and get advanced chapters!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

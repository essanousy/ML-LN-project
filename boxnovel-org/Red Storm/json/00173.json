His enemy was slowly approaching him step by step.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Most importantly, the green flag with a white shamshir that represented Venersis, caught his eye.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">For the longest time, they needed to run away to the oasis as soon as they saw that flag. There has never been a time that this green flag was broken by Pareia.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Since that was what he was attempting to do for the first time, and knowing that failure meant the sacrifices of the warriors who were involved in this plan would have been for naught, Pere had to calm his beating heart to coldly lead his warriors.</span></p><ul style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><li style=\"list-style-type: disc; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre\"><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Do not fight him head on.

Even though he knew he himself had gotten stronger, there was still a large gap between him and his brother. Knowing that, there was no way he could fight against Venersis who was his brother\u2019s equal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, that single line that Pere saw a few days ago made him change his mind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">That was a single perfect escape route, and a way that could completely destroy the enemy. Suddenly being able to see that line was really the heavens helping Pareia. At least that is what Pere firmly believed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Furthermore, the remaining Greatest Warriors agreed with Pere\u2019s opinion. Pere\u2019s line was perfect even in the eyes of the experienced and wise Greatest Warriors.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If they used this line properly, Pere believed they could destroy that Venersis. Everyone truly believed that this was the birth of another Greatest Warrior with great instincts while looking at Pere who discovered this line. Even if it was a coincidence, it would be hard to see such a line without any special abilities.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The question now was how to utilize it properly without the enemy recognizing their plan. They had finished their preparations to make that happen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cI will commend you for your courage to dare to stand in front of us after always hiding away and avoiding the Shuarei\u2019s blade.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Once both formations were prepared, one of the Shuarei\u2019s Greatest Warriors rushed forward and mocked Pareia.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cWhether it is an attack on an oasis, defending an oasis, or even fighting it out on the field like this, it is all part of war.

Almost instantly, Pere\u2019s shamshir broke through Ombrella\u2019s defense and swung toward his chest, but Ombrella leaned toward the side of the pirma to avoid it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After taking the advantage, Pere continued to attack Ombrella. This led to the Pareia\u2019s formation cheering out loudly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u2018He is that young warrior I saw last time.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Venersis looked toward Pere and remembered that he was the younger of the two brothers he saved last time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Yulian was one thing, but seeing even the younger brother having grown up to be a great warrior like this, Venersis was feeling a bit bitter.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Putting aside the fact that he let them go, there were currently no Greatest Warriors in his Shuarei that could fend off these two brothers.

They had already discussed how they will move in today\u2019s battle, and that exchange was to just confirm their plan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Pareia and Shuarei\u2019s warriors quickly approached each other and engaged each other.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was always the same method, but knowing it did not do much good. Venersis and the Desert Sword\u2019s line of attack was unstoppable. It was similar to the current line of attack used by Yulian and the Red Storm.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">For a while, Pareia\u2019s warriors fought valiantly against the Shuarei\u2019s warriors, but their formation was slowly breaking apart through Venersis\u2019s movement. They started to get pushed back and the formation started to break down even faster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Pere realized that waiting any longer would result in all of them dying and shouted out loudly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cAll units retreat!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After receiving Pere\u2019s order, the warriors gathered with their lead warrior before starting their retreat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The three thousand warriors and lead warriors who had already made up their mind to give their lives up to buy the rest time to retreat waited in the rear before shouting out loudly and rushing toward the Shuarei once the main forces rushed by them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Their mission was to defend until the main forces were able to increase their speed of retreat. By the time Pareia\u2019s main forces were able to get their pirmas at full speed, there was less than 1,000 of these warriors left.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cRetreat.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The only one of three lead warriors who was still alive gave the order to retreat, but these warriors were already surrounded by the 20,000 Shuarei warriors and had no escape path.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The remaining warriors were instantly captured or killed, and Pere clenched his teeth watching it happen.

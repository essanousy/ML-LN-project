I also needed to save myself.</i></p><br/><p>Book 2-1.1 Venersis</p><br/><p>Pere\u2019s body was shaking to the point that he almost fell off the pirma. This man was the Western War God and Pareia\u2019s worst enemy. Putting the Shuarei tribe second, if anyone could catch just this one man, Pareia could resolve all the grudges it has had for a long time.</p><br/><p>Pere's wanted to swing his shamshir and try battling him right now. He wanted to catch Venersis and resolve his grudges. However, he needed to protect Yulian and make it to Rivolde.</p><br/><p>Venersis noticed that the murderous aura coming from Pere\u2019s body suddenly disappeared and looked at Pere as if he was surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Venersis had only been looking at Pere because of his strength that he didn\u2019t notice Yulian leaning on the pirma until now.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been hit by poison.\u201d</p><br/><p>Venersis looked at Yulian\u2019s face as he asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is he?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pere hesitated at Venesis\u2019 question.</p><br/><p>\u2018A true warrior will not kill someone who is not holding a weapon. If I pretend he is someone else, there is a higher chance of survival.</p><br/><p>Pere debated for a bit but ended up shaking his head. His brother will need to become Pareia\u2019s glow in the future. He could not use a lie to save his life.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is Pareia\u2019s young glow, the \u2018Desert Conqueror,\u2019 Yulian Provoke, my older brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAn enemy we must catch.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pere put some strength into his hand at Venersis\u2019 response.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, a warrior does not use a crisis for their benefit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pere was confused at what Venersis just said. What did he mean?</p><br/><p>Venersis turned his head and called one of the warriors over. Once he said something to the warrior, the warrior nodded his head and went up to each and every one of the Desert Sword members and said something in their ear. Each time he moved on to a new warrior, they would also nod their head. As he continued on, one warrior nodded his head before handing over a bag to the messenger. The messenger then handed the bag to Venersis.</p><br/><p>Venersis opened the bag and took a sniff before coming towards Pere.</p><br/><p>Even without noticing, Pere\u2019s body shook for a split second.</p><br/><p>Pere felt with his whole body just why Venersis was Venersis.</p><br/><p>Venersis stretched out his arm and held the bag in front of Pere.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is our tribe\u2019s shanana (emergency antidote that desert warriors carry with them. Although each tribe has their own unique take on it, overall, they all share the fact that they can help fight off poison). You should know how to use it, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pere stared at Venersis for a bit before reaching out and taking the bag.</p><br/><p>\u201cNext time, I hope to meet you on the battlefield, young warrior brothers.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Venersis turned around and started to walk away, Pere hesitated before starting to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cWarrior Venersis.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Venersis turned his head, Pere mumbled for a bit before speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will definitely repay this favor. However, I will not forget my grudge.\u201d</p><br/><p>Venersis started to smile as he looked at Pere and then turned to look at Yulian.</p><br/><p>\u2018Her son. He\u2019s grown quite a bit.\u2019</p><br/><p>Venersis was thinking about Mairez. She was the woman he wanted to make his own no matter the cost.</p><br/><p>(TL: Holy crap. Guess we finally get the backstory).</p><br/><p>Short chapter but we start a flashback next so it was a good place to cut it. And a great cliffhanger! I\u2019m back folks! :)</p><br/>\n</div>"}

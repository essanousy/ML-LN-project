I\u2019m tempted to change it to how not to breathe but I\u2019m going to stay true to the raw for now. If something comes up later that tells me it should be the other way, I\u2019ll update at that point)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe first thing to learn is how to breathe, and how to not breathe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian was confused by Chun Myung Hoon\u2019s words and responded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making me say things twice. The first thing you will learn is how to breathe and how to not breathe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my question. What kind of \u2026.?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPOW!\u201d</p><br/><p>As Chun Myung Hoon\u2019s fist struck Yulian\u2019s stomach, Yulian groaned and bent forward in pain as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cOw! Master, why are you hitting me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will explain the rules of learning from me. First, you will never question what I say. No matter what, your answer should be Yes, Master. Got it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of rule is that?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPOW!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven after I explain it to you, you don\u2019t listen. Back then and even now, if someone doesn\u2019t listen to me, I beat them up. That is the second rule. Got it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian changed his response as soon as he saw Chun Myung Hoon\u2019s fist raise up.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat. That\u2019s the way. My word is law and all you need to do is listen and learn. It\u2019s such a simple method to learn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re correct.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chun Myung Hoon nodded, as if he was satisfied with Yulian\u2019s quick adaptation.</p><br/><p>Although Yulian had issues with it, he decided that if this was his Master\u2019s way of teaching, he will not complain again.</p><br/><p>The desert training was also rough. Whether it was a dad teaching his son or an older warrior teaching a younger warrior, it was the same.</p><br/><p>When it came to learning, there was no such thing as your own opinion, and there definitely was no way to not listen to their advice.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s the type of place the desert was.</p><br/><p>The desert is where the thing that you pay attention to today could be what saves your life tomorrow. Because of this, all of the desert tribes pay their respect to the elders in the tribe. There was nothing to throw away amongst the life experiences they had gathered.</p><br/><p>Yulian knew this to be a fact; this is why he was able to make the determination to not complain and follow Chun Myung Hoon\u2019s instructions.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen you are breathing, breathe in until you count to five. When you are breathing out, breathe out until you count to ten. You also need to make sure that you go slowly so that you make no noises when you are breathing. Give it a try.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian tried breathing in and out, following Chun Myung Hoon\u2019s instructions.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething else to pay attention to is that your stomach must move in the opposite direction. When breathing in, suck in your stomach. When breathing out, stick your stomach out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian followed the instructions and replied:</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as easy as I thought it would be.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThink about it as if you are breathing through your back. That should make it a bit easier.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBreathe through your back?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian had questions about Chun Myung Hoon\u2019s incomprehensible words, but decided to do as he was told. He focused on breathing through his back as he took a breath in, and it was a bit easier, as Chung Myung Hoon indicated.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo I have to continue breathing like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chun Myung Hoon replied to Yulian\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo be honest, my martial arts is the hardest in the beginning. You must continue this breathing method whenever you are awake. Truthfully, you should also continue it while you are sleeping, but it is still too soon for that. What I am certain about, is that if you are able to master this breathing method, it will be much easier to learn my martial arts. I guess it will be easier in the beginning if we cut down your sleeping time. We need you to get used to it and master it completely so that you can breathe like this even when you are sleeping.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Yulian tried to determine how this will help, his breathing returned to normal and he did not properly execute the breathing method. In that moment, Yulian felt intense pain on top of his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cPOW!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! Master, why are you hitting me again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you go back to how you used to breathe even though I just taught it to you? I must be strict with you as you are both my first and my last disciple. If you are useless, won\u2019t it make me also look useless as your master?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut do you have to hit me like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPOW!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian felt the pain again.</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you talking back was not allowed. For the next month, you will only be practicing this breathing method until it is engrained in your body. During this month, if you keep forgetting like this, it will only delay your path to learning my skills.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat can I gain through this method? If you could at least let me know that one thing, I will never talk back again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chun Myung Hoon debated hitting Yulian again for his retort but decided against it. It would not be too late to hit him after showing him.</p><br/><p>\u201cPay attention.\u201d</p><br/><p>After talking to Yulian, Chun Myung Hoon headed to the large wooden pillar supporting the center of the Paoe and pushed on the pillar with one finger.</p><br/><p>Yulian was in suspense to see what Chun Myung Hoon would do; he could not hide his surprise after staring at Chun Myung Hoon\u2019s finger. As if he was punching a hole through a piece of paper, Chun Myung Hoon\u2019s hand was going through the wooden pillar.</p><br/><p>When Chun Myung Hoon removed his hand, there was a small hole, the size of a finger, on the wooden pillar.</p><br/><p>\u201cI promise that you will be able to do this if you continue that breathing method for just ten years. Of course, it also depends on whether you listen to my instructions completely or not.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I can do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh yeah? Then first, take a punch since you talked back earlier.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster! That\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPOW!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chun Myung Hoon\u2019s finger, which was able to pierce even wood, struck at Yulian\u2019s forehead. However, like magic, even though the noise was loud and the pain was terrible, you could not see any damage on Yulian. On the outside, he looked fine.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is an art to hitting as well. If your skin got cut, how sad would your dad be?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chun Myung Hoon laughed as he responded.</p><br/><p>Yulian suddenly felt as if despair was gathering around him.</p><br/><p>Yulian thought that he had a lot of endurance, but that type of thought disappeared quickly. In a month, you could not find that type of thought even if you washed your face cleanly and searched.</p><br/><p>Chun Myung Hoon\u2019s flicks hurt so much to be human.</p><br/><p>Chun Myung Hoon followed Yulian around; if Yulian\u2019s breathing became disturbed even by a little, he relentlessly flicked his finger to make Yulian pay for his mistake.</p><br/><p>He even stayed by him and hit him while Yulian was sleeping, so it became normal for Yulian to not sleep well and greet the sun with significantly red eyes and large bags under his eyes.</p><br/><p>People also started to worry because Yulian was losing so much weight, but Yulian clenched his teeth and persevered. This was the first thing his master showed him. He started to develop the confidence that there was no way he couldn\u2019t master this when he was trying so hard.</p><br/><p>Days passed by like this, and just before a month ended, the amount of times Yulian was getting hit started to shrink little by little.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected, there is nothing that cannot be solved by violence.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chun Myung Hoon was satisfied by his teaching methods and made up his mind to move on to the next stage.</p><br/><p>\u201cYulian.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you have shown some progress, I will teach you something else.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand, Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time it is how to walk, how to run, how to sit, and how to lay down.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will follow attentively, Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian had adapted to Chun Myung Hoon over the last month. Yes. Yulian quickly learned that Chun Myung Hoon was a dictator.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time, it looks like you are not asking why you have to learn such things.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve learned that everything you teach me becomes my skin and blood. How could I dare to question you, Master?\u201d (TL: Basically, I know it\u2019s all to help me become stronger is how I take it.)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve improved. Listen well. A person must have good posture and stand up straight. For the time being, this is what we will focus on. Of course, there is also the proper way to sleep. You understand what I mean, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 of course.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian felt like everything was becoming dark again. He finally thought he could sleep well but now it was focusing on his posture.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think you will adapt quickly. You have to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha. Of course\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s start. You know I don\u2019t like to repeat myself, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian could not sleep properly for the next three months.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I understand where you are coming from, Greatest Warrior Venersis, however, it will be enough if we slowly start our attack.\u201d</p><br/><p>Venersis was extremely upset inside.</p><br/><p>\u2018How could someone who knows what honor is ignore my honor and make such an order in the past? You were the one who went against the truce the very next day and ordered an attack. Someone like you dares to talk to me about fame and honor?\u2019</p><br/><p>Venersis looked at Hangry almost to the point he was glaring at him, but Hangry continued on like he didn\u2019t care.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur Greatest Warrior\u2019s flaw is that he is too passionate. Shouldn\u2019t you step back a bit to give the other Greatest Warriors and your subordinate warriors opportunities as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Is that what this is all about?\u2019</p><br/><p>Venersis lamented Hangry\u2019s words in his mind. In the end, Hangry didn\u2019t want to let Venersis go in the fear that Venersis would have too many achievements.</p><br/><p>He had been that way from the beginning, but lately, the other Greatest Warriors as well as the Glow have been trying to limit him too much. Furthermore, Hangry even thought that Venersis was aiming for the Glow position.</p><br/><p>The last Glow was not like this. In fact, the last Glow helped stop the other Greatest Warriors\u2019 envies with his own body. He knew the most about what Venersis wanted, and trusted Venersis more than anybody else.</p><br/><p>In return, Venersis also gave the Glow his complete loyalty, and did everything in his power to increase the 9 oasis they controlled to 11.</p><br/><p>But once Hangry became Glow, he worked with the other Greatest Warriors to limit Venersis, and tried to get in Venersis\u2019s way at any chance he got.</p><br/><p>This was the reason that the Shuarei, which had the War God of the West as well as the greatest warrior brigade known as the Desert Sword, still only had eleven oasis.</p><br/><p>The internal affairs were as rotten as they could be.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you, the tribe\u2019s best warrior, think that is the best course of action, I will think about it. But only if you are planning on giving the warriors of the next generation a chance to build battle experience.\u201d</p><br/><p>Which warrior in Shuarei could handle the two brothers whose fame has spread across the desert?</p><br/><p>In order to go up against his Desert Sword, he created a new warrior brigade known as the Red Storm. The fact that their skills were similar to that of the Desert Sword was something one of the soldiers reported back after seeing it for themselves.</p><br/><p>The majority of the lead warriors in Shuarei with battle experiences were part of Venersis\u2019s brigade. It made sense, since for the last 20 years, 80 percent of the Shuarei\u2019s wars were handled by Venersis.</p><br/><p>With Pareia\u2019s current chaos, there was an absolute chance of victory. However, if it was not himself but a different Greatest Warrior who only sought to achieve some merits for himself, their chances were only 50 percent.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat will not work. Out of Pareia\u2019s Greatest Warriors, only I can handle the Angry Brandistock, The Sharp Teeth, and the Large Spear. \u00a0In addition, there has been news lately about Glow Baguna\u2019s son, Yulian, the young warrior who has enough strength to be called the Desert Conqueror. Please allow me to go. If we miss this opportunity, we don\u2019t know how long we will need to continue to maintain this status quo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreatest Warrior Venersis, aren\u2019t you looking down on our Shuarei warriors a bit too much?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am not looking down on them. I am just speaking the truth. Our current Greatest Warriors have not experienced a real battle for a long time. On the other hand, hasn\u2019t Pareia\u2019s warriors faced a large amount of battles until now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that why I am saying we will help them build the experiences starting now? Since Pareia is in chaos as you mentioned, what better setting to get some experience? Plus, you should have taken warriors from other Oasis with you when you were involved in many wars in the past to prevent something like this from happening.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing what Hangry had to say, Venersis was starting to get angry.</p><br/><p>\u2018If you had not denied my requests for reinforcements time after time, half of Pareia\u2019s oasis would already be ours and our warriors would have gained a lot of experience.\u2019</p><br/><p>Venersis wanted to shout like that.</p><br/><p>If it wasn\u2019t Glow Hangry and the other Greatest Warriors restricting him, he would have been able to even defeat the unified brigades of Pareia\u2019s Greatest Warriors.</p><br/><p>However, even Venersis could not defeat three Greatest Warriors while lacking reinforcements and warriors. How could he manage to defeat the enemy who had over three times the amount of warriors?</p><br/><p>The reason he managed to even take two oasis away was because of the previous Glow\u2019s full support.</p><br/><p>Venersis tried to hold back his anger as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cGlow, the ultimate opportunity for our Shuarei to pounce on has arrived. Pareia\u2019s tight defenses are a mess because of the chaos, and thanks to that, the cooperation levels between oasis are in shambles. If we attack right now, within a month, I can offer you two of their oasis.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Please don\u2019t consider me as an enemy, but as an ally.\u2019 That\u2019s how he wanted to end it, but Venersis continued on as if he was trying to console Hangry.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease allow the warriors of my oasis and a reinforcement of 10,000 warriors to head out. I will definitely dedicate the glory of the victory to the Shuarei and Glow Hangry-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Venersis not stepping back and even bowing a bit as he asked, Hangry\u2019s heart moved a little.</p><br/><p>At that moment, one of the other Greatest Warriors who was with them, The Piercing Bow of the Bushy Oasis, Recharei Breeze shouted toward Venersis.</p><br/><p>\u201cBloodied Hand Venersis, aren\u2019t you seeking too much glory? For what reason do you seek so much glory? If the Glow commands you, you should just follow his command. For what reason must you be the one to step forward?\u201d</p><br/><p>Venersis also let out his anger and shouted back at Recharei.</p><br/><p>\u201cRecharei, a warrior uses all of their strength for the good of their tribe, not for themselves. Are you trying to insult me with those words?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou started the insult. If it is not you, we cannot take on Pareia? Aren\u2019t you the one insulting all of Shuarei\u2019s Greatest Warriors?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAm I wrong? Did you already forget that you lost to Pareia\u2019s Large Spear? Who was it that saved you when that happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Recharei\u2019s face turned red at Venersis\u2019s response. It was Venersis who had come to his rescue at that time.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph.\u201d</p><br/><p>Recharei did not respond to Venersis\u2019s question before looking toward Hangry and starting to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you give this Recharei the warriors of our Bushy Oasis and an additional 10,000 warriors, this Recharei Breeze will guarantee that I will deliver Pareia\u2019s oasis to the Glow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI object. Recharei is a Greatest Warrior who has never led a group of over 10,000 warriors. And please do not forget that to guarantee a victory, I need to take part, Glow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOur Glow will decide whether I go or not, it is not your decision. Why are you flapping your mouth when the Glow has not said anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>Recharei looked at Venersis with an expression and nuance that implied that Venersis made a grave mistake as he scolded Venersis and looked toward Hangry.</p><br/><p>\u201cVenersis\u2019s crime has started to pierce the heavens. Now he does not even wait for the Glow\u2019s decision and decides for himself what is allowed and not allowed. I want to say that the Glow should punish him for his crimes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because many of the Greatest Warriors and the chiefs of the oasis who were there did not like the fact that Venersis had so much accomplishments, they started to agree and say that Recharei was right.</p><br/><p>Hangry became upset after listening and realizing that they might be right, and because he himself did not think positively about Venersis, he took Recharei\u2019s side as he started to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreatest Warrior Venersis, think before you speak. This expedition will be handed to Recharei. Each Greatest Warrior should prepare their warriors and send them to Recharei.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGlow!\u201d</p><br/><p>Venersis shouted loudly but Hangry did not falter a bit as he continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreatest Warrior Venersis should return to your oasis and take a short break. Even if the other chiefs and Greatest Warriors had not said anything, you\u2019ve been active for quite a bit. Shouldn\u2019t you take a break every so often?\u201d</p><br/><p>Stomp.</p><br/><p>As Venersis continued to get angry, he subconsciously started to stomp his foot.</p><br/><p>Stomp. Stomp. Stomp.</p><br/><p>He was going back and forth between anger and frustration.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? Do you dare to throw a tantrum at the Glow\u2019s order?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Recharei shouted at him, Venersis glared at Recharei before abruptly standing up and exiting the paoe.</p><br/><p>Behind him, many were saying he was arrogant, that his haughtiness could reach the heavens, and that he was looking down on the Glow.</p><br/><p>Venersis looked up at the desert\u2019s blue sky.</p><br/><p>\u2018What are the heavens planning to do with our Shuarei\u2026..\u2019</p><br/><p>Venersis was full of lament and had an ominous feeling as he headed toward his paoe.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

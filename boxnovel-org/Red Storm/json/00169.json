Actually, after taking a look once the battle ended, he could see that he suffered more losses than the Shuarei did. This battle was totally his defeat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He prepared everything he could, but it was certain that regular battle tactics would not be able to handle the might of Venersis.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Venersis\u2019s plan was simple. Just like Runa had told Yulian to do against the united tribe, he did not use any type of strategy. He just pushed forward and attacked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Runa had prepared a lot of different traps as well as nets, ropes, and other things to trip their pirmas, but they were useless.

There was no way to surround or cut through Venersis and his warriors. Every method Runa tried out because of the numbers advantage became useless after Venersis moved around a couple times.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Venersis also had the same intuition ability that Yulian had.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Actually, Venersis was much more experienced with that ability when it came to using it in battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u2018How could the heavens allow two such monsters\u2026\u2026\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Runa could not believe it.

He had prepared to completely eat up the Shuarei warriors that attacked. He wanted to land a heavy blow to the Shuarei so that they could attack as soon as the Glow returned. He wanted to make it so that the Shuarei would not be able to even think about attacking for at least a short period of time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">But he could tell with today\u2019s battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Venersis.

Vibli and Egane, as well as Trebol who left this world in the war against Runa in the past. It was like Venersis was proving that it really did take three of Pareia\u2019s Greatest Warriors working together to barely manage to defend against him in the past. Giant gaps were created in the formation wherever Venersis went by.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This would be the same no matter what kind of training the warriors did. The only reason they were able to reduce the damage once they finally realized they will lose and started to retreat was because Pere was able to work together with another Greatest Warrior to hinder Venersis.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cAre you sure you are trying to make me feel better?

However, the question becomes whether we can fend off Venersis\u2019s attack while I am gone. Neither Greatest Warrior Egane or Greatest Warrior Vibli are in Pareia right now\u2026\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was the reason Runa was hesitating even though he had a method to counterattack. You needed to have confidence to launch a counterattack, and he was worried about whether there was a warrior who would be able to fend Venersis off if he was gone. Pere and a couple other Greatest Warriors were here, but even that made him a bit worried.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">That was why he had said either Greatest Warrior Egane or Greatest Warrior Vibli should remain in Pareia as they headed off to fight the united tribe, but the Glow was also lacking in war experience. Because of that, an experienced warrior had to support him. That was why Vibli had gone as his Assistant Warrior.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As for Greatest Warrior Egane, a seasoned Greatest Warrior was needed to draw as many of the united tribe\u2019s forces as possible to their decoy land troops. With things being that way, there was no choice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The biggest reason though, was because of Runa\u2019s confidence. The counterattack method was just something he prepared just in case it was needed. Runa had never considered the fact that he would not be able to win against Venersis when he had multiple times the number of warriors, especially warriors who had been trained exactly as he had wanted them to be trained.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, Runa had a large headache knowing that there really was another warrior like Yulian.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Pound. Pound.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">While Runa was thinking about all of that, Pere pounded his chest twice before starting to speak.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cI will successfully fend him off even if my body breaks in half. I know the other Greatest Warriors may be lacking in comparison to the third generation Greatest Warriors, but they are not lacking too much experience. If it is just defending against Venersis, it should be enough.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cLet\u2019s continue this discussion after we handle the next defensive battle.

They then placed 50,000 warriors toward the quicksand river side, with 20,000 remaining in the center area to reinforce either side as needed. This plan by the united tribe was not a bad plan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They would have been able to do a bit better if they did not lose 20,000 warriors in the battle on the quicksand river, but it was not a bad idea to quickly forget about that and do the most with what they had left.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, a lack of war experience and lack of information ended up playing a critical factor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They needed to know more about Pareia, and should have further researched how the young Glow named Yulian had gained the title of \u2018War God of the Eastern Desert.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Continuing on from the first battle, in the ten battles they have had already, including ones where they were attacking and defending at an oasis, the united tribe had not managed to win even one battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As a result, the united tribe ended up being pushed back until they merged with the 20,000 warriors in the middle area, and after losing a couple oases, they even called back half of the 30,000 warriors defending against Egane to raise their numbers once more.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Pareia pushed for the united tribe\u2019s surrender many times, but the united tribe did not accept it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They too agreed that there was no way to stop Pareia\u2019s momentum, but they could not understand the current situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of the united tribe\u2019s warriors were thinking that \u2018there must be some way to win.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Yulian was angry with their thought process.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The ones to suffer under a useless Glow were the people of the tribe and the Greatest Warriors.

It was because of Pere and Yulian; the weight of these two men made the speed of their pirma much slower than the pirmas of the warriors chasing after them. Thankfully, it was Yulian\u2019s pirma; no other pirmas could run like this while carrying two large men like them.</p><br/><p>The warriors chasing after them smartly cornered them in one direction to prevent them from heading into the tribe.</p><br/><p>Grace and Pere were regretting not bracing themselves for danger and running towards the tribe from the beginning as the two were sweating while guiding the pirmas to avoid the shamshirs flying towards them from behind.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is there nothing we can do?\u2019</p><br/><p>The word despair started to float inside Grace\u2019s mind. As she started to think about it, Grace, who had been following behind Yulian and Pere as if she was defending them, was injured multiple times by the warriors\u2019 shamshirs.</p><br/><p>Seeing her like that, Pere started to shout.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will do whatever I can to handle them, sister-in-law, you must return to the tribe and explain the situation to them. If we can do that\u2026 ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>As another shamshir started to fly towards them, Pere stopped talking and used all of his energy to protect the pirma and his body.</p><br/><p>After listening to Pere\u2019s words, Grace realized that they would both just end up dying if they continued like this, and nodded her head as she spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen...point the pirma towards Rivolde. I will soon follow with reinforcements\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Pere nodded his head and turned the pirma towards the south and started to run again.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease take care of your hyung-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou be safe as well sister-in-law.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pere had never called Grace sister-in-law before today.</p><br/><p>It was obvious, since he didn\u2019t even call his brother hyung, but right now, the term sister-in-law came out time after time.</p><br/><p>Seeing them split up, the warriors also split into two groups to chase down both Grace and Pere.</p><br/><p>Another long game of cat and mouse started.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo not lose to some stupid poison. Are you going to die when I, Pere, am truly admiring you for the first time in my life?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pere continued to shout while riding. He was encouraging himself to keep going.</p><br/><p>The dreams that Yulian talked about in their father\u2019s paoe, as well as his boldness and passion.</p><br/><p>It was the moment that Yulian, who seemed very far away, started to get closer in his mind as his brother. It was the first time that even someone like him, who has a lot of pride, felt the feeling of defeat.</p><br/><p>The level of their dreams were worlds apart.</p><br/><p>His dream as the Glow of Pareia would have been to protect the tribe and make it stronger. It was a simple dream. But his brother was different.</p><br/><p>Watching his brother, who seemed to have thought about everything, respond to all of their questions, made Pere realize that his brother had been planning his dream for a long time.</p><br/><p>It lit a fire in his heart.</p><br/><p>He even mistakenly thought that they could achieve it if he worked together with his brother. No, he was sure that they could achieve it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you are going to die like this, what happens to me, and all the sweat and blood I\u2019ve shed to defeat you?! You must beat it! This Pere will protect hyung-nim until you do! I promise!\u201d</p><br/><p>Warm tears started to pour out of Pere\u2019s eyes. It was both tears of regret that he realized his brother\u2019s thoughts only just now, as well as tears of sorrow for the unfairness of the current situation.</p><br/><p>Pere started to recover his physical strength that he had lost from fatigue. After all, this was Pere who was said to have been born with divine powers.</p><br/><p>If Yulian had not learned martial arts from Chun Myung Hoon, Pareia\u2019s greatest warrior would have been Pere.</p><br/><p>As for the person to fight against the Western War God Venersis, that would also have been Pere and not Yulian. Pere was born with extreme strength, to the point that Baguna would even share the information with Chun Myung Hoon.</p><br/><p>Otherwise, would Chun Myung Hoon have been surprised at Pere\u2019s strength to the point he debated about taking Pere as his disciple for a long time?</p><br/><p>It looked like Pere\u2019s divine power was working hard to save his life, as well as his brother\u2019s life, as they fell in this road between life and death.</p><br/><p>He had enough strength to his use shamshir to strike down against the chasing warriors\u2019 shamshirs and break them in half.</p><br/><p>Once they felt the extremely murderous aura coming out of Pere\u2019s body, the warriors after them felt a sense of fear, and more importantly, their pirmas were surprised and started to run wild.</p><br/><p>Pere used this moment to successfully create some distance with the warriors chasing after them.</p><br/><p>After letting out a sigh of relief, Pere took a look at Yulian\u2019s condition. Yulian\u2019s face had turned dark blue.</p><br/><p>In the desert, there were many types of poison.</p><br/><p>The desert was a place where the multitude of plants and monsters, and even insects and the sand could be poisonous.</p><br/><p>However, as killing someone with poison was scorned, it did not happen often.</p><br/><p>Although the shamans may use poison for their incantations or for healing, there were no instances of warriors using poison.</p><br/><p>The only time warriors could be seen using poison was when they covered their weapon with poison before they headed out to take care of some monsters.</p><br/><p>With their pride, all of them wanted to protect their tribe with their abilities, without relying on something like poison that they did not put in any effort to use.</p><br/><p>It was normal for a strong warrior to defeat a weak warrior, however, the tribe could not accept a weak warrior using poison to defeat a stronger warrior.</p><br/><p>This was why Pere did not have much knowledge regarding poison.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know what type of poison Yulian was suffering from, or even how to treat him. He knew nothing. How could he? He had never used nor suffered from poison before.</p><br/><p>If someone was bitten by a poisonous snake or a scorpion, you cut around the area and suck out the blood. That much he knew, but since his brother had drank the poison, does he have to slice his brother\u2019s neck?</p><br/><p>\u201cHyung-nim, what do I have to do? How should I handle this situation? Hyung-nim, do something! Since this Pere has protected you, you must also defeat this poison!\u201d</p><br/><p>Pere grabbed onto Yulian\u2019s leg and started to shout in frustration.</p><br/><p>\u201cUhh\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Did Pere\u2019s words reach him? Yulian let out a moan before putting on a frown that looked like it could crush his skull.</p><br/><p>Yulian was using all of his force. To protect its owner who had lost consciousness, Yulian\u2019s body was working on its own to utilize the \u2018naegashimbup,\u2019 the internal force that was ingrained in Yulian\u2019s body, to barely manage to prevent the poison from reaching Yulian\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>If it was Chun Myung Hoon, even if someone had fed him poison while he was sleeping, he could laugh in his sleep and his internal energy would force it back out of his mouth or out the tips of his fingers or toes, but Yulian\u2019s limit was preventing the poison from reaching his heart.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t like Yulian was showing to Pere that he was touched by Pere\u2019s shouts and sincerity; it was more of a subconscious response to let him know that he was alive.</p><br/><p>\u201cHyung-nim!\u201d</p><br/><p>Pere was extremely delighted at Yulian\u2019s moaning and started to shake him. This was a very dangerous thing to do. (TL: No duh, who shakes an injured person\u2026) It was even more dangerous than meditating on a running pirma.</p><br/><p>Brrrrrrrrr.</p><br/><p>Yulian\u2019s body instantly started to shiver.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I will prepare everything for you. However, not everything in the world goes the way you want it to go. In the case that an oasis has already promised their loyalty to Orca, wouldn\u2019t it be pretty dangerous? So I will give you 1,000 warriors. With over 1,000 warriors, you should be able to escape from such predicaments.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Dejaine was worrying about potential dangers like a wise old person, Yulian shook his head and responded.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re being honest, I have an ally who is greater than any army in the world. If he goes with me, I know there is no way I will fall into any danger.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is this ally? He? You are talking about one person?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it is a single person. However, he is someone that all of the Red Storm warriors and I could attack together and he still wouldn\u2019t bat an eye. Rather, he would be able to overpower us with a single finger. He is a very strong individual.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you perhaps talking about the old man who cured your poison yesterday?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is my master. He is quite violent but he cherishes me, so you don\u2019t have to worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dejaine was full of curiosity at Yulian\u2019s words and decided to ask.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying that old man\u2019s abilities are really that great, huh? When I saw him yesterday, I could tell that he probably had some amazing skills, but enough to easily take down you and all of Red Storm attacking together?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha. My father was in awe as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFine. Since you put it that way, I will no longer worry. So, when do you plan on departing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGlow Dejaine-nim, while you are preparing the warriors and pirmas, I will finish getting the Red Storm warriors ready.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand. I will get them ready right away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you very much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dejaine pointed at Yulian with his finger before saying one last thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo not forget the promise.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian laughed loudly before nodding his head and leaving Dejaine\u2019s paoe.</p><br/><p>There actually wasn\u2019t much to get ready.</p><br/><p>All he had to do was say something that will get them fired up.</p><br/><p>\u2018Librie. The woman whom I once called my mother. I will show you that the punishment for rebelling is quite severe.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yulian thought like that as he started to walk quickly. He planned on leaving as soon as Glow Dejaine finished getting everything ready.</p><br/><p>Yulian was able to see Pere, who was watching the Red Storm warriors practice.</p><br/><p>\u201cPere!\u201d</p><br/><p>As Yulian called out to him in a loud voice, Pere turned his head and looked towards Yulian.</p><br/><p>Seeing Pere who looked like he wanted to say something but couldn\u2019t say anything, Yulian spoke first.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you. I tried to look for you yesterday to tell you, but I was not able to do so. Pere, thank you very much.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Yulian thanked him and grabbed Pere\u2019s hand, Pere had a nervous look on his face as he moved his hands away before speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo not be like this. It is embarrassing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI never imagined that it would be you who saved my life.\u201d</p><br/><p>At Yulian\u2019s words, Pere spoke as if he was angry.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you think of me...did you see me as someone who would betray my brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, but didn\u2019t you have your own ambitions? If you had left everybody behind and ran away to inform the tribe, everybody would have died and you would have become the Glow. At first, I was surprised that you didn\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am also a desert warrior and a man of the Provoke family. I do not use such underhanded tactics. Plus, hyung, I\u2026..I wanted to beat you fairly and become Glow, I wouldn\u2019t do it like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is why I am both sorry and thankful to you. I\u2019m sorry for being so stupid that I didn\u2019t know your feelings, and thankful that you helped me realize it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pere looked away at Yulian\u2019s words and started kicking the sand under his feet as he started to talk again.</p><br/><p>\u201cHyung-nim, the thing you said then \u2026 about unifying the desert and making sure nobody can look down on us, hearing that, I realized that your ambition is at a different level than mine. All I had been thinking about was how to show that I was better than you to become the Glow\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m very thankful that you understand my dream.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHyung-nim, you are Pareia\u2019s Glow from here on. So please don\u2019t speak to me that way. Once you officially become the Glow, I will even start speaking formally to you. Also, this Pere, swears my loyalty to you from now on, so do not worry about that.\u201d</p><br/><p>At Pere\u2019s words, Yulian was extremely touched and pulled Pere in for a hug.</p><br/><p>\u201cKnowing that us brothers will combine our will to reach for the same dream, this hyung of yours is extremely excited.</p><br/><p>Pere tried to push Yulian away as he answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven I am still not used to this new me. Please stop being like this. It\u2019s uncomfortable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Pere speak as if he was shy, Yulian smiled looking at his younger brother.</p><br/><p>This was the brother who had never called him hyung before; it was normal for it to be awkward.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you figure out your plan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pere hid his awkwardness and asked. Yulian revealed his thoughts to Pere. Pere nodded his head and agreed with Yulian\u2019s decision but asked some questions.</p><br/><p>\u201cHyung, I believe you are right. However, won\u2019t it be dangerous? If even one thing goes wrong, we cannot return alive. If it is an order, I will follow you, but I cannot agree to such a dangerous plan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pere seemed to have the same concerns as Dejaine Nellisi. Yulian\u2019s plan was quite reckless.</p><br/><p>To travel through all of Pareia\u2019s oasis with less than three hundred warriors trying to convince the chiefs. With the internal affairs in a mess like right now, Pareia\u2019s situation will be known by other tribes. The Shuarei, as well as the increasing number of tribes drooling over Pareia\u2019s oasis, will have put the security at each oasis on high alert.</p><br/><p>Yulian convinced Pere.</p><br/><p>\u201cI need to believe in what father has continued to do all these years. I also need to believe in the things you and I have done until now. If we try to take things back by force, there will be too much damage on both sides and Pareia will become the weakest tribe in the desert. If that happens, our dream will become at least ten years further away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI believe that Pareia\u2019s chiefs are not such pushovers. They have eyes and ears. Once they realize everything that has happened is Librie and Silence\u2019s Janet\u2019s doing, it will be easy to convince them.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Yulian spoke convincingly, Pere had no choice but to agree.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you say so, I will follow you. What is it you want me to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll you have to do is show them that you are with me. We just have to instill the belief in them that us brothers will work together to help Pareia rise up like a storm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess, since we are not going to fight them. Hyung-nim, I understand your intentions. Then I will prepare as well. Anyways, those warriors are quite amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think? Aren\u2019t they just full of energy? They are extremely important warriors who will help us achieve the dreams for Pareia.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHyung-nim, I am envious of you. If I knew things would be like this, I would have made some warriors to be with me as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is the problem? You and I are no longer separated. I will make you one of the leaders of Red Storm. Get along with them. We are now all one.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pere became emotional once more at his brother\u2019s words.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

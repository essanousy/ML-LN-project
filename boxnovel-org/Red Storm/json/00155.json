They were surprised that Silence was worried about Pareia, they were surprised that Pareia had enough strength for this large Empire to acknowledge them, and most importantly, they were surprised that Silence had picked them as an ally.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The people of the desert despised using outside help in their battles.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even if you looked at Pareia, the reason Pareia\u2019s oases chiefs backed Yulian during the revolt was because of the fact that the Silence was involved in that rebellion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">That should have been enough reason to chase that diplomat away, but with fire on their heels from the danger with Pareia, the three Glows were paying careful attention to what the other two Glows might do.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cI guess you really don\u2019t know whether Pareia\u2019s blade will be pointed to the Western Desert or to your Empire after they unite the Eastern Desert.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Seeing Kinicks give an answer that was neither an acceptance or decline, the fat man who called himself the Silence Empire\u2019s diplomat was smiling internally.

If you truly are worried about the same thing, I believe I have come with the solution to your problem. Of course we will keep it an absolute secret that we helped you.

However, there was not a single person who was against it. Didn\u2019t the man say that everything will be done in secret? The three Glows looked at each other before starting to write on the piece of paper in front of them. Seeing the three of them starting to write, the man was thinking that it was finally over.

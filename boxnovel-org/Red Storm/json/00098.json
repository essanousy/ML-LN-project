So just relax.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think that is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious? I am the same way. I am nervous without reason. That would be the only reason we feel so nervous even though we have more warriors. It is from the fear that if we lose, it is the end for our Wikaly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Runa finally relented after Abham\u2019s words. It was because what he said was not wrong.</p><br/><p>After finishing his discussion with Abham, Runa left the paoe and headed toward the paoe where the two Greatest Warriors of Pareia were staying.</p><br/><p>The two warriors standing guard recognized Runa and bowed their heads.</p><br/><p>\u201cWere there any problems?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. Both of them have been quiet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must not do anything to offend them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes sir.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two warriors responded in unison.</p><br/><p>Honestly speaking, guarding the two Greatest Warriors was just a formality. If they were to try to forcefully block the two Greatest Warriors from escaping, they just had to kill them or tie them up and bury them in the sand with only their head remaining above it.</p><br/><p>However, the warriors of the desert respected the heroes and strong warriors, regardless of their tribal affiliations.</p><br/><p>Especially Pareia\u2019s third generation Greatest Warriors Vibli and Trebol, these were the greatest of warriors just underneath the shadow of Venersis. The fact that they were able to catch these two Greatest Warriors was a sense of pride for the Wikaly. As a result, the Wikaly were giving them the respect they deserved as Greatest Warriors.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, because Vibli and Trebol were not thinking about escaping as they lost in a fair battle, it really was just done as a formality. They were just hoping for their tribe to pay the ransom and retrieve them.</p><br/><p>Runa lifted the cloth covering the entrance of the paoe and entered.</p><br/><p>Vibli and Trebol were sitting on the carpet with their eyes closed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWikaly warrior Runa Brink greets Greatest Warriors Trebol and Vibli.\u201d</p><br/><p>At Runa\u2019s words, the two Greatest Warriors opened their eyes and looked toward him.</p><br/><p>They had been hearing a lot about this man.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was a great leadership and strategy you showed. Both of us ended up being tricked.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou praise me too much. I was just lucky to have a scheme go in my favor. But I am still happy. The fact that it will not be difficult to hold Pareia back with you two Greatest Warriors here does make me feel better.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Vibli snorted before closing his eyes again, Trebol shook his head and closed his eyes as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have started the negotiations for your ransom.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them opened their eyes again at Runa\u2019s words. They were not expecting the Wikaly to offer to release them.</p><br/><p>Although they were caught this time from a very big mistake, if they were released, they would not make such mistakes ever again. Furthermore, with the two of them, Pareia\u2019s strength will be more than doubled.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur condition was that if Glow Yulian-nim can promise to not invade the Wikaly while he is alive, we will let the two of you go. Shouldn\u2019t we at least get this much ransom for two Greatest Warriors? How do you think he responded?\u201d</p><br/><p>The two Greatest Warriors closed their eyes again. They knew about how much the Glow emphasized the fact that if they miss this opportunity, there will be no other opportunities in the future. And even if there were, they would take too long to appear.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m sure he was extremely frustrated.\u2019</p><br/><p>This was what the two Greatest Warriors were thinking, and they were right.</p><br/><p>\u2018He will not accept this deal.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess you expected it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Runa asked as if he was shocked after seeing their expressions. He was able to verify just how strong of a desire the enemy Glow had to invade them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is what Glow Yulian-nim said. He said that if we do not let the two of you go, he will kill us all. If we let you go, then he will let us live. The thing that makes me wonder about this is whether Glow Yulian-nim understands the current situation properly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think? Do you two believe that you can convince him if I was to let you go?\u201d</p><br/><p>Vibli\u2019s eyes started to shine as he started to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what are you planning to do right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is as I have mentioned. I will let the two of you go. Ah! I can also let your warriors go as well. That part will only be if Pareia releases our warriors as well, but if it is just the two of you, I will let you go with the condition that you will convince Glow Yulian-nim to retreat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you joking right now?! Are you trying to mock us?!\u201d</p><br/><p>As Trebol shouted loudly, Runa had an expression that seemed to ask what Trebol meant.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? I am being sincere right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are telling a Greatest Warrior who leads warriors in battle to tell their chiefs to not go to war? If that is not a joke, then what else could it be?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just want peace. Lately, our Wikaly has never annoyed Pareia by causing issues at our border, and when Pareia\u2019s former Glow had faced that terrible situation and Pareia and the Shuarei went to war, our Wikaly did not act on it. Since he forgot about all of that and turned his sword toward us, how could we not be frustrated by it?\u201d [1]</p><br/><p>At Runa\u2019s words that flowed out like the flowing quicksand, the two Greatest Warriors could not say anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I shall come visit you again in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Runa left the two silent Greatest Warriors and headed out of the paoe.</p><br/><p>Even after these two Greatest Warriors returned to Pareia in the future, their will to invade should be affected by this conversation.</p><br/><p>A smile started to form on Runa\u2019s lips.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Pere and the Red Storm\u2019s four horsemen entered Yulian\u2019s paoe.</p><br/><p>Yulian had called for them.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou called?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian offered each of them a seat and slowly started to look at them once they sat down.</p><br/><p>They were all reliable warriors. He had debated gathering all of the Red Storm warriors to talk about this, but he thought it would have a greater impact for them to share this rather than him. That was why he had called them over.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pere noticed the hesitation in Yulian\u2019s face and quickly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI called to talk about entering the lion\u2019s den.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once Yulian opened is mouth, Pere, as well as Haisha and the others, all looked at each other. They could not understand what he was talking about.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know it is reckless, but I believe it is doable. That \u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what is it that you are beating around the bush so much?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Triquel cautiously asked, Yulian hesitated before finally answering.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wish to go rescue the two Greatest Warriors who have been taken captive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course we have to do that. If we can take over the center of the Wikaly, that should not be too difficult.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian shook his head at Pere\u2019s response.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt will be difficult with just Greatest Warrior Egane. We need the same number of warriors as the enemy, as well as Greatest Warriors Trebol and Vibli. Since we have less warriors than they do, we need to rely on the movement of segmented groups to capture the Wikaly. Right now, our choices are to either retreat, or partake in a dangerous battle.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what is it that the Glow is thinking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Haisha\u2019s eyes opened widely as he asked. It was as if he could vividly see Yulian\u2019s idea.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Red Storm and I will barge into the Wikaly Oasis to rescue the two Greatest Warriors.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHyung-nim!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGlow!\u201d</p><br/><p>The ones to shout at Yulian\u2019s idea were Pere and Shubeon.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could you think about doing something so reckless?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat idea is terrible. We may have accepted the fact that we may die at war, but I do not wish to die such a dog\u2019s death. Even if I die, I wish to do it in a large battlefield after I have done everything I could.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pere and Shubeon each stated their opposition against the plan.</p><br/><p>Yulian looked toward Haisha. Haisha was the warrior who understood Yulian the best. Haisha had understood Yulian\u2019s intentions from the beginning as Yulian was beating around the bush, and had been thinking deeply about it from the beginning. Triquel was just looking at Yulian with his eyes wide open.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it an order?\u201d</p><br/><p>Thrint looked Yulian directly in the eye as he asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you call this an order? I am just bringing up a potential course of action.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you confident?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shubeon turned pale at Thrint\u2019s question and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cThrint, what the hell are you saying right now? It is our job as his personal guards to prevent the Glow-nim from making the wrong decision.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShubeon, are you confident that we will die a dog\u2019s death?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThrint!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have been a part of three different battles where over 10,000 warriors clashed against each other. Have the members of Red Storm ever ended up with injuries in any of those battles?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe had allies with us then. This time, it will be just us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is still the same thing. All we have to do is run toward Yulian-nim\u2019s back. It does not matter whether we have allies with us or not. Answer me. Do you think that all of us in the Red Storm will die a dog\u2019s death while fighting with Yulian-nim?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Shubeon could not say anything.</p><br/><p>He was confident about any challenges as long as he followed after Yulian. The thing that he felt in every battle was that as long as he followed after Yulian, he was certain that there would be no problems.</p><br/><p>The fact that there were no injuries whatsoever to the Red Storm warriors was proof of that.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to ask that question as well. Glow. How confident are you that we will succeed?\u201d</p><br/><p>Haisha must have finished thinking as he finally started to speak.</p><br/><p>The moment Yulian nodded his head, Pere shot up from his seat as he started to shout.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you all saying? Haisha, even you are going to agree with the Glow\u2019s reckless plan? If something happens to the Glow, it will not just be an issue with the war. It will be the end of Pareia.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian reached his arm out and grabbed Pere\u2019s wrist and sat him back down.</p><br/><p>\u201cHyung-nim!\u201d</p><br/><p>As Pere shouted in frustration, Yulian started to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is why I called you here, Pere. In the off chance that something happens to me, you must take control of the tribe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo not say something so stupid. Do you really think that makes sense? How could there be such a reckless plan? You want to take 50 people to take on 20,000 because you have faith in your abilities? Hyung-nim, do you think that you are some kind of god?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPere!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI cannot agree to this even if I die. You want me to take control if you go and something ends up happening? Do you think that the position of Glow is some type of child\u2019s play?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pere huffed and puffed as he looked toward the Red Storm warriors and started to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou all say something as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thrint stood up from his seat and started to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it is an order, I will prepare.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThrint!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shubeon grabbed onto Thrint and shouted, but Thrint did not move as he just stood there looking at Yulian.</p><br/><p>Haisha stood up as well as he started to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cI also believe that we will not have any problems as long as we are with the Glow. I will convince the Red Storm warriors.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaisha, what will we do if even you are convinced by this unbelievable plan?\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, Shubeon looked toward Haisha as he started to shout. He then started to speak toward Triquel who was still looking around at everyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cTriquel, help me stop them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shubeon felt like he could stop this if Triquel was on their side as they would outnumber them three to two.</p><br/><p>But Triquel looked toward everyone before hitting the table and starting to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cShit, whatever. Half of us have already agreed and the Glow is saying let\u2019s do it. All I can do is follow his will.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pere and Shubeon looked toward each other and beating their chests with frustration in their minds.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will never agree with this. But if you still wish to go, I will follow you as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are not allowed to come.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHyung-nim, just why is it that you are allowed to do it but I am not?\u201d</p><br/><p>___________________________________</p><br/><p>[1] Says the guy who was pushing for the Wikaly to attack.</p><br/><p>Become a patron and get advanced chapters!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

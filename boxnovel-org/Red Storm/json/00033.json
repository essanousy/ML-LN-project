It was a way of showing that they were being respectful, and in addition, if the tribe didn\u2019t listen to their demands, it was putting pressure onto the tribe that they were not giving face to the empire\u2019s prince. It was a great diplomatic tactic, however, the immature prince ended up being poison instead.</p><br/><p>\u2018This damn idiot of a prince! Because of you, we just lost thousands of the fiercest warriors available! In addition, the potential danger\u2026\u2026 what are you going to do if they end up shaking hands to work together with the Rojini Kingdom\u2026\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Janet was internally swearing at Shareulo Fury Silence, who was sitting arrogantly next to him.</p><br/><p>Shareulo Fury SIlence was the type of prince who was useless, other than having the blood of the King in his veins.</p><br/><p>If you don\u2019t have the abilities, you need to know how to shut up, however, he didn\u2019t even have that much common sense. Even within the empire, he was causing a headache to the royal family for doing whatever he wants and stealing other people\u2019s wealth to use as he pleased.</p><br/><p>However, among the royal family, the older brother, the crown prince, Shaone Fury Silence III, felt sorry for his immature younger brother, that he forced Shareulo to do all sorts of things, trying to make a man out of him. (TL: Mr., I\u2019ll\u2026. make a man\u2026. out of you\u2026.) But Shareulo couldn\u2019t even understand just how hard his brother was trying to help him, and would only complain and haphazardly do whatever he was ordered to do.</p><br/><p>Crown Prince Shaone knew that Pareia would be extremely repulsed by their request, but would end up having to send over the desert warriors. That\u2019s why he sent his brother here with a veteran like Janet, so that they can solidify his brother\u2019s status for the future.</p><br/><p>Even if you are a prince, if you had no merits, you end up falling down and becoming a useless person. In order to build up his brother\u2019s merit, he sent him on a mission that was guaranteed to succeed.</p><br/><p>Understanding the crown prince\u2019s reason for sending the second prince with him, Janet spoke with the prince before this meeting and reminded him over and over to not to scratch the pride of the desert warriors. Even then, this damned idiot of a prince ended up causing a big issue.</p><br/><p>Janet looked at the Glow and his son with a worried look on his face. Glow Baguna\u2019s face had become completely red, and his son abruptly stood up and started to shout.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou may be the prince of an empire, but right now, if we were to use your language, you are in front of a king! Don\u2019t you think your words are too insulting?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Glow Baguna must have been extremely angry as well, as he did not stop Yulian and just continued to watch. There was a limit to being patient. A desert warrior\u2019s pride is as high as the sky; you don\u2019t even need to talk about the pride of the Glow who rules over them.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you saying you will attack me! You must want to lose your neck for treason.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shareulo did not back down and also stood up from his seat and shouted at the top of his lungs. Yulian clenched his fists tightly before speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is not your empire but Pareia of the desert. Who do you think you are speaking in front of when talking about treason!\u201d</p><br/><p>Who would dare to talk back to him in the empire? Shareulo was not afraid of anyone who was not his father or brother.</p><br/><p>Clang.</p><br/><p>Shareulo drew his sword from his waist and the sword directly started to stab towards Yulian.</p><br/><p>Baguna was completely surprised, and Janet was stupefied. He knew this prince was a moron, but he would have never dreamt that he was this bad! If he was even 1/1000th similar to his brother the crown prince, he would never do something like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cYulian!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPrince!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even in the midst of Baguna and Janet both shouting, Shareulo\u2019s sword continued to stab towards Yulian.</p><br/><p>The moment he thought Yulian\u2019s waist was bending backwards, a large mass of iron flashed in front of his eyes and effortlessly smacked Shareulo\u2019s sword away.</p><br/><p>Yulian could not hold it in anymore and lifted up his greatsword to send Shareulo\u2019s sword flying.</p><br/><p>Shareulo\u2019s sword, which had been struck by the greatsword, flew high up in the paoe before flying outside.</p><br/><p>\u2018When they said the current Pareia\u2019s princes were extremely talented, they weren\u2019t kidding.\u2019</p><br/><p>Being a diplomat, Janet grew up as a civil servant and knew no martial arts. However, he was someone who had met many weapon merchants, warriors, and knights of many foreign nations.</p><br/><p>He had seen many knights during his life, but there were not many who could instantly and effortlessly move a large sword like Yulian did. Just looking at it, you could tell that the greatsword was heavy enough to be difficult for one person to even just lift up.</p><br/><p>Watching his weapon being flung away from his hand, Shareulo turned red in embarrassment as he started to shout.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow dare you swing your sword towards me! You must be begging to die! With one word from me, I can make sure a barbarian tribe like this disappears overnight!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the fuck do you think you\u2019re saying!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian was extremely angry to the point his face turned red. At the moment he was about to move his greatsword, Janet felt that if he let this continue any further, something serious would happen and quickly spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrince Shareulo, I will not allow you to continue speaking like this. Don\u2019t forget that I have been given the full authority of this voyage. This was a command given directly to me by the wise crown prince Shaone Fury Silence III, working in the will of the great emperor Shaone Fury Silence II.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shareulo glared at Janet who was scolding him using his father and brother\u2019s full names, before silently walking out of the paoe. Even Shareulo could not go against the will of his father and brother.</p><br/><p>As Shareulo walked out like that, Janet used his handkerchief to wipe the sweat off his forehead before bowing ninety degrees in front of Baguna and speaking respectfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cI ask for Glow Baguna\u2019s understanding. The prince must have been extremely tired from the journey and full of irritation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me your royal family insults anybody and swings their sword at anybody when they are irritated?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening to Baguna\u2019s voice full of anger, Janet knew that he would not be able to take anything back from this visit. Rather, they needed to give a lot of things to calm them down.</p><br/><p>To lose Pareia right now meant they will not have a source of the black water they desperately needed for the war. Furthermore, no matter how you looked at it, this was their fault. Even using all the flowery language he had learned being a diplomat for a long time could not cover that truth up.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, Janet, apologize on his behalf for insulting the honorable name of Pareia. I will definitely pay you back for causing damage to its name.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian yelled at Janet\u2019s response.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you really think you can pay to make up for damaging a warrior\u2019s pride?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m truly sorry. I can only hope for understanding and forgiveness from Glow Baguna, the Benevolent Eye.\u201d</p><br/><p>Glow Baguna shook his head at Janet\u2019s actions. He was definitely a flawless diplomat. As an envoy of the Empire, they could stick their nose up in the air and do as they pleased, however, this diplomat did not show that type of personality. He was a veteran who made it sound like he was compromising with you while still taking everything he wanted to take. He would rather have a diplomat like the moronic prince from earlier, as they would be easier to deal with.</p><br/><p>Since Baguna did not plan to start a war with the Silence Empire, he decided that he will pretend to lose and give a bit before sending them back quietly. For at least a year, they would not be able to make any types of demands.</p><br/><p>Baguna gestured with his hand to stop Yulian from saying something again.</p><br/><p>\u201cI suppose the prince may have said something like that as he has not had the opportunity to get to know us. It could also be because he is a healthy young man.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI, Janet, bow my head in thanks at Glow Baguna, the Benevolent Eye\u2019s act of goodwill.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cToday is my birthday. Although something bad has happened on a happy day, since you have come a long way, celebrate my birthday, and enjoy before you leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you mention it, we brought a present for Glow Baguna. We are providing both wagons of iron that we brought today as Glow Baguna-nim\u2019s birthday present. I hope you accept it with a happy heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>Janet clearly knew what Baguna was thinking on the inside, but he put on a smiling expression and played along. That was how diplomacy worked. He\u2019ll end up returning empty handed after giving up all the iron they brought with them to trade, but to end it at this level was great news.</p><br/><p>Yulian was very upset listening to his father and Janet.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m sure father is even more upset. To receive this type of insult but need to hold back and restrain himself\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He was also saddened by the fact that one day, it would be on him to take that kind of insult and hold back with a smile.</p><br/><p>At that point, Baguna called Yulian.</p><br/><p>\u201cYulian.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, father.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baguna looked at Yulian for a long time before moving his lips. It looked like he wanted to say something but was holding back, before he said his son\u2019s name again.</p><br/><p>\u201cYulian.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will not forget.\u201d</p><br/><p>Father and son. The two men\u2019s eyes were burning red.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

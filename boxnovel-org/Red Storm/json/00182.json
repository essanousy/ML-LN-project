About three people were sent to the largest oasis that Yulian was at to help institute the reorganization plan as well.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was very complicated and large scale that it took quite a lot of time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They needed to determine the rotation for sending warriors out to collect Monster\u2019s Souls and Black Water. Taking care of monsters or wild animals to keep the oases safe were left to each individual oasis.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Not only that, they also needed people who could come up with a way to utilize the women for different production-related tasks as well so that the nation could become self-sufficient.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Other than the production-related tasks, they started to prepare individuals who could fill necessary positions in the future by training them on the history and culture of the continent, music, and agriculture.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The reorganization was even larger on the warrior side, however, the Greatest Warriors were already very experienced and extremely literate.

Although experience was needed, this would help support their knowledge base for the positions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There were quite a lot of chaotic issues at first, but as time went on, people started to move to the positions they were suited for. Once they started to get used to the positions that fit their strengths, Pareia quickly started to return to stability.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"></span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Twelfth month in the year 260 in the continental calendar.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A lot of people started to gather at this location that had changed its name from the Watery Oasis to Frost.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The majority were chiefs and chieftains who were representing a portion of Pareia, the Greatest Warriors, and the lead warriors.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The reason all these people who were so busy they could barely blink were gathered here was because today was the day they were celebrating the completion of the first stage of the Castle of Storm.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Yulian, as well as the many people gathered, were extremely satisfied with the large castle in front of their eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The construction was extremely large and had taken over five years; and this was the result of monopolizing twenty percent of Pareia\u2019s population for the past five years.However, even with all of that effort and all of the money spent, it was just the end of the initial stage of construction.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It still needed years of construction and repair before drawing in citizens. There also needed to build defenses around the castle as well. This castle still had a lot of remaining construction, and was still lacking quite a bit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, the important factor was that they could now use this castle as the focal point to clash against the Silence Empire.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Everyone started to take a look around the inside of the castle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cWe plan to dig a large trench around the castle in the near future. The continent uses water to prevent enemies from approaching the castle, but we will fill it with Black Water. In times of emergency, we will have an extra layer of defense once we light it on fire. It will be difficult to douse it with water because of the heat. We will have an extra method for castle defense.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The chiefs and chieftains in charge of the internal affairs were interested in the offices and meeting rooms they were going to be using, while the Greatest Warriors were interested in the layout of the entire castle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was because there was something else for them to study. Castle defense was something that even the experienced Greatest Warriors were not used to doing in the desert. After listening to Runa briefly explain the configuration of the castle, they went around looking at each area of the castle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Yulian walked with Grace and Violet to the rooms dedicated for them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cYour offices are already finished.

It wasn\u2019t like a good prayer room made it easier to determine fortunes or strengthen an incantation, but it was always easier to focus and chant somewhere you felt at peace.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Violet had left her homeland alone as a woman to come to Pareia where she knew absolutely nobody. She then confidently filled her position as the Glow\u2019s wife. At the same time, it was true that she had been lonely.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Seeing the sights from her homeland like this made her extremely emotional.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cEven if you are busy, go visit the Shire once with her. Even if you or I am taking care of her, I\u2019m sure she is still lonely. Everybody has been finding it hard to approach her since she replaced Tuma Takaka-nim as the Chief Shaman so she has had a hard time getting close to people.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Grace was whispering to Yulian while watching Violet who was in front of her.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cI should do that.

That\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian was stuttering in embarrassment. He could feel the Red Dragon laughing at him. He could see the smile being painted on its face.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou idiot. Back away.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chun Myung Hoon turned his hand around to grab Yulian by the collar and swung his arm. Yulian\u2019s body went soaring through the sky like a tiny rock and Chun Myung Hoon drew large circles with both of his arms.</p><br/><p>- Breath (Breath of the Soul)</p><br/><p>And the Red Dragon\u2019s mouth opened.</p><br/><p>A powerful flame came bursting out of the dragon\u2019s mouth, and the flame covered Chun Myung Hoon faster than you could even blink.</p><br/><p>Chun Myung Hoon quickly raised his Heavenly Breath to the twelfth level and used internal force to guide the flame.</p><br/><p>It was an amazing sight. The flame from the dragon was becoming a tornado in front of Chun Myung Hoon, and Chun Myung Hoon continued to swing his two arms while moving backwards to get rid of the flame. Yulian\u2019s jaws fell in disbelief as he was watching from far away, and it was the same for the Red Dragon.</p><br/><p>It was not even magic, it was not even a mana field. All it was was a puny human swinging his two arms to put out his breath. At first, he was amused at the vast amount of mana this old man had, and shot out the breath expecting him to block it, but he could not ever imagine him blocking it like this.</p><br/><p>It was a short duration of a few seconds, but it seemed like an eternity. But it finally ended and Chun Myung Hoon yelled out loud.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like you\u2019re a monster I can\u2019t let live. How dare an insect let out such great natural force. I shall defeat you for the benefit of all the people of this world.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Chun Myung Hoon dropped his arms, Yulian\u2019s greatswords ended up in Chun Myung Hoon\u2019s hands before Yulian could even say \u2018Ah!\u2019 and Chun Myung Hoon started to move his two feet quickly.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrrrr.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Red Dragon let out a yell before flapping its wings and flying high into the sky. At that moment, the greatswords in Chun Myung Hoon\u2019s hands scratched the bottom of the Dragon\u2019s feet.</p><br/><p>Clang.</p><br/><p>It sounded like something hit the sword. But all he managed to do was scratch the tip of the dragon\u2019s toenail.</p><br/><p>\u201cA flying insect\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Chun Myung Hoon muttered in disbelief. He thought the wings were not usable, so he was shocked to see it fly so high in the sky.</p><br/><p>- Human, do not swing your sword. I have no desire to kill you.</p><br/><p>The booming voice of the Dragon in the sky came through in the language of the desert, but Chun Myung Hoon only snorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, you think I can\u2019t catch you because you flew up into the sky?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chun Myung Hoon measured the distance between the two of them and started to gather force into the blade before swinging. A strong force, visible to the naked eye, started to form a Crescent shape before shooting off into the sky.</p><br/><p>It was not just one or two. Countless crescent shaped force attacks filled the sky, with another crescent being added every time he swung the sword.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, the dragon did not look like he was concerned about it, avoiding it or using magic to reflect it to make it disappear.</p><br/><p>Seeing that his method was not working, Chun Myung Hoon unwillingly stopped his blade. After flying in circles a couple of times, the dragon landed back on the ground.</p><br/><p>- Human, I predicted that you will arrive in this world. And I have no desires whatsoever to fight you. I was merely curious about your strength and chose to test you. There is no reason to harbor any negative feelings towards me.</p><br/><p>The dragon spoke jovially as it lowered its head but Chun Myung Hoon just snorted as if he did not want to accept it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, an insect becoming curious about humans?\u201d</p><br/><p>- Raaaaawr. Do not ignore me. I am a being that has been here since the beginning of time.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn our world, even dogs and cows have existed from the beginning of time along with humans.\u201d</p><br/><p>The dragon did not know what \u2018dogs and cows\u2019 were, but he was able to understand enough to know he was making fun of him. But there was nothing he could do. The human in front of him was at the same level as the undying granny on the magic tower. In addition, he was the first person to arrive in this world as the prophecy stated.</p><br/><p>As he was not an average person, the dragon spoke respectfully.</p><br/><p>- Put away your hostility. I have no desire to fight you, nor do I have the desire to harm the young human behind you. I finally understand the mission I was given.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph.\u201d</p><br/><p>As if he understood that he too could not do anything to this large insect, Chun Myung Hoon continued to show anger but did not swing his sword anymore.</p><br/><p>- Young Human, come over here.</p><br/><p>As the dragon called Yulian who was staring mindlessly from far away, Yulian looked to his master.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome over here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once he received his master\u2019s approval, Yulian approached the Red Dragon. Seeing Yulian approach, the Red Dragon spoke to Yulian.</p><br/><p>- Due to my silly mistake, I became involved with the large monster known as the sandworm. I must thank you for getting me out of that predicament.</p><br/><p>Technically, the proper name for it is the Giant Sand Dragon, but the Dragon used Chun Myung Hoon\u2019s term for it, as if it could not believe that such a monster would have the title of dragon. That\u2019s why it used the term sandworm when it thanked Yulian.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Ahh\u2026 yes\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>- I can\u2019t stop admiring your bravery, young human. As a result, I am giving you my blessing. Tell me your wish. A contract with a dragon follows you forever. As long as there is no change to the laws of the world, I will grant you your wish.</p><br/><p>Yulian did not expect this from the Dragon and took turns looking at the Dragon and his master, as if the cat got his tongue.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like it has quite the ability. I will not get involved.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chun Myung Hoon thought that Yulian was considering his standing and and let him know.</p><br/><p>Yulian finally opened his mouth to say:</p><br/><p>\u201cI do not know what kind of existence you are.\u201d</p><br/><p>- There are not many humans who know of my existence. All you have to do is tell me your wish. It was thanks to you that I was able to find out my mission, and I may end up being stuck here for hundreds of years because of you too.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease give confirmation and luck to my dream.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Dragon thought Yulian\u2019s answer was quite odd and tilted his head a bit to look at Yulian. Right away, Yulian\u2019s dream was transmitted to him. That type of dream was something he could grant right now.</p><br/><p>The dragon spoke.</p><br/><p>- You\u2019re not asking me to do it for you.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy dream is something that must be achieved by my hands. My revenge must also be achieved by my own hands. If it is handled by someone else, it is not my dream nor my revenge.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chun Myung Hoon was pleased with Yulian\u2019s answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis punk may lack talent, but his determination is firm. He will definitely end up a great being. I\u2019m very proud. But of course. As my, Chun Myung Hoon\u2019s disciple, he needs to show that level of determination.\u201d</p><br/><p>- From the beginning of time, the name that I have been given is Ultima Ops Richard. I use my authority, which has been given to me since the beginning of time to command to you, my blessing will protect you on the battlefield.</p><br/><p>Yulian felt his head clear with the Dragon\u2019s answer. The fatigue that he had instantly disappeared, and it was as if his chest and dantian were rumbling greatly, as if it was vomiting out force. That type of electricity filled his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhhhh~!\u201d</p><br/><p>This type of unbelievable feeling led Yulian to unintentionally shout, and Chun Myung Hoon nodded his head listening to the clear shout.</p><br/><p>At this level when he is only eighteen years old, if he continued to polish his skills continuously, before the end of the year, he should be able to control the force with his sword.</p><br/><p>At that level, he\u2019ll be similar in speed to the talented children in China.</p><br/><p>The dragon then turned to Chun Myung Hoon.</p><br/><p>- I did not know why I came here, but after meeting you, I have learned my mission. Do you know why you are here?</p><br/><p>Chun Myung Hoon thought he might finally learn the reason he ended up here.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know why?\u201d</p><br/><p>- Know, I do. Long discussion, you and I need. (TL: Sounds like Yoda)</p><br/><p>With the dragon\u2019s response, Chun Myung Hoon said to Yulian:</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulations on your coming-of-age ceremony. You caught to monster with your courage so return to the tribe proud. I must chat with this insect for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Yulian politely responded, Chun Myung Hoon traded some words with the dragon before flying up and landing on the dragon\u2019s neck. The dragon then flapped its wings and flew off into the sky.</p><br/><p>Yulian stared until the dragon and his master disappeared into the sky, and once they disappeared completely, he went to get the Monster\u2019s Soul from the two Sand Dragons.</p><br/><p>The Monster\u2019s Soul for the Sand Dragon he slashed remained intact, however, there was nothing left of the Sand Dragon that was ripped to shreds by the dragon.</p><br/><p>After putting the Sand Dragon\u2019s Monster\u2019s Soul in his pocket, Yulian smiled.</p><br/><p>His coming-of-age ceremony ended successfully, and his master showed a satisfied smile. In addition, he received some type of blessing from an ancient lifeform known as the dragon, which filled his entire body with energy. There was nothing else he could ask for right now.</p><br/><p>Yulian\u2019s footsteps as he returned to the tribe felt very light.</p><br/><p>TL:</p><br/><p>This is the end of the \u201cComing-of-Age Ceremony\u201d Arc.</p><br/><p>Next up:</p><br/><p>Red Storm</p><br/><p>The warriors\u2019 mouths were filled with swear words. You couldn\u2019t dream about having complaints while getting stronger, but you couldn\u2019t prevent yourself from swearing.</p><br/><p>(TL: Looks like we are about to see the creation of Red Storm begin!)</p><br/>\n</div>"}

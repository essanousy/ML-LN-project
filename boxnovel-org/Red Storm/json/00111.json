However, we cannot change if we fear that chaos. I want to catch up to the continent in every aspect that the desert is currently lacking in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Runa tapped his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is still a lot in this Runa\u2019s head. All of them cannot be put into play right now, but someday, I plan to carry out each and every one of them. I absolutely need the assistance of the wise oases leaders to make it happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c......\u201d</p><br/><p>The oases chiefs and the chieftains looked at one another without being able to say anything.</p><br/><p>Internally, they were thinking, and even shouting that \u2018we can\u2019t do this, it is too dangerous,\u2019 but it was not easy to say it out loud.</p><br/><p>\u201cRuna, I understand your desire. However, it is too fast. You are correct when you say the faster the better, but the amount of chaos increases the faster we go.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Runa\u2019s face started to turn dark at Yulian\u2019s response, Yulian continued on.</p><br/><p>\u201cCarry out your plan slowly in multiple parts so that we can minimize the chaos and guarantee we will not fail. Then use that to convince me as well as the wise chiefs that have gathered here today.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Yulian responded for the uncertain chiefs, all of them nodded their heads to agree as they looked toward Runa.</p><br/><p>Even Runa was happy knowing that he had at least received a positive response.</p><br/><p>They will automatically start to follow his plan if he slowly showed them the process.</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand. I will slowly show it to you. I will draw the foundation and start to color it one color at a time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Runa answered in a confident voice to motivate himself.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>The extremely long meeting finally ended long into the night.</p><br/><p>Yulian had planned on letting Runa stay next to his paoe for the time being.</p><br/><p>Although Runa became one of Pareia\u2019s people, there may be many warriors who want him dead because of all of the warriors who died by his hands. So this was just a safety measure. He didn\u2019t want something like that to happen, but you could never tell what people were thinking. Yulian did not want even the slightest of dangers to occur.</p><br/><p>Yulian asked Runa a question before they entered the paoe.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did you prepare all of those things?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is something I have been thinking about even when I was in the Wikaly tribe. However, nobody had paid attention. Since I was a man who could not even complete his coming-of-age ceremony properly, they would not listen to anything I had to say.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Runa bitterly answered Yulian\u2019s question, Yulian put his hand on Runa\u2019s shoulder as he responded.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am different. I like people with talent. You might think I am being snobbish, but I believe that is the type of thinking all Glows should have. Show me what you are capable of doing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo not worry, Glow. From here on out, you will have many headaches because of the suggestions I bring up. Hahaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Runa laugh, Yulian started to laugh as well, as the two of them started to walk again.</p><br/><p>\u201cGlow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAbham-nim is not someone who should have lived like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know. That is why he recognized your talent. However, since he announced his retirement as a warrior, there is nothing I can do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even after hearing what Yulian had to say, Abham had stumbled like a weak old man.</p><br/><p>You could say that he had lost all desire to do anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is the only person to appreciate my abilities before you. Please do not take this the wrong way, but if Abham-nim had been the Wikaly Glow, the Wikaly may have won the last war. Even with the Glow having taken control of the quicksand river.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian was not taken back by Runa\u2019s dangerous proclamation. Yulian knew just how much Runa cherished Abham. Yulian started to laugh as he answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha, I will not disagree with you. Honestly, when Greatest Warrior Egane told me to make you one of my people, I had to think hard about it. I admired your abilities, but I lost too many of my close and important warriors because of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess I should visit Egane-nim today and thank him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian started to smile at Runa\u2019s response and put his hand on his chest as he continued to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, deep inside my heart, I knew that you were someone I absolutely needed to have. It became even stronger once I started to think about how having you could save even more lives in the future. That was why I threatened the Wikaly to make you mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c......\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am even more certain about it after seeing you today. I do not question that our Pareia will develop significantly thanks to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will make sure to live up to your expectations. Anyways, when will that merchant named Edwin come again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. Since the war is now over, he should be bringing a load of materials soon. We will give our black water and Monster\u2019s Souls to him, and he will give us items from the continent, as well as high quality iron and food. We need to prepare for the upcoming growth to our population.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am just disappointed that I was not there in the beginning. The Glow has given him too many things.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Runa spoke with disappointment, Yulian shrugged his shoulders as he answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe needed an immediate investor since we did not have much time. Plus, you can\u2019t do anything about the deals we have already promised. You should not need to worry much since we can always ask for anything we need.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am relieved to hear that. Please let me be the one to negotiate with him the next time he is here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will give you the power to make any decisions in my stead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you. We need to be competitive in order to change the culture of our tribe. I hope that this merchant has a large enough guild to make that happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can guarantee his reliability. He is someone who has not broken a single promise we have made.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess it will be easy to work with him.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two men slowly approached the paoe as they continued to talk.</p><br/><p>Guoooooooooooo~!</p><br/><p>Runa flinched after hearing that loud noise and questioned Yulian.</p><br/><p>\u201cGlow, do you hear some type of noise?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat noise?\u201d</p><br/><p>Runa thought he had heard wrong after hearing Yulian\u2019s response. If the Glow, who is a warrior among warriors, did not hear something that he had heard, he must have heard wrong.</p><br/><p>Guooooooooooo~!</p><br/><p>However, hearing this noise again, Runa asked once more.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuo? It is a noise that sounds like a crying monster.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian finally realized why Runa flinched and started to smile as he responded.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is the noise of my wife\u2019s pet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis pet makes quite a strange noise.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha. You\u2019ll need to get used to him so I guess I should officially introduce you. Do not be too surprised. Shopping!\u201d</p><br/><p>Runa could feel something large moving in the darkness after hearing Yulian\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>He then felt something slowly crawling out from behind the paoe...as well as fear.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the head of a large monster head toward Yulian, Runa shouted in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cSand Dragon?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian reached his hand out to pet Shopping\u2019s head as he answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cHis name is Shopping. He is my wife\u2019s pirma, as well as the warrior protecting my wife. You do not need to worry about him. He is completely tamed to the point he does not even drool while looking at people. When he is hungry, he just leaves to eat before coming back. He is a good boy that even brings back wild animals from time to time for us to eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat...you...this monster...is your pet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get used to it the more you see him. We are hoping that this punk ends up becoming a giant. If that happens, we may be able to tame a few more Sand Dragons.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaaaa!\u201d</p><br/><p>Runa let out a noise of disbelief, as Yulian patted Shopping\u2019s head and introduced Runa.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is a new family member. His name is Runa Brink. He is a very smart person, so if you try to trick him, you may end up looking stupid.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe understands human speech?\u201d</p><br/><p>Grrrrr.</p><br/><p>At Runa\u2019s question, Shopping made a noise before approaching Runa. Runa jumped back in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe does. He is after all the strongest monster in the desert. Once you get closer to him, just getting on top of him for a ride will be a good experience for you as well. There is nowhere better to get a good view of the entire desert than Shopping\u2019s head.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaa~, I understand, Glow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Runa calmed his racing heart before looking at Shopping. He didn\u2019t think he would ever get used to it.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go in. I will officially introduce you to my wife.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes...Glow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Runa peeked at Shopping before quickly following after Yulian.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrace.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian lifted the cloth to enter the paoe as he called Grace\u2019s name. Grace quickly hugged Yulian as if she had been waiting and started to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe meeting went very late.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian lifted Grace up as he answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel like it will continue to be like this for a while. I have someone to introduce to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grace blushed a bit after realizing Runa was there before moving away from Yulian and greeting him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe I have met this warrior before. I am the Glow\u2019s first wife, Grace Nellisi.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that Grace\u2019s appearance was even more beautiful than he could have ever imagined, Runa subconsciously started to blush as he lowered his head and responded.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy name is Runa Brink. I greet the Mother of Pa...reia.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPfft, why are you so nervous? The Glow brings warriors over frequently, so there is no need to be nervous. Although it is true that you are interrupting a husband and wife\u2019s alone time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once Grace realized that the young man in front of her was the warrior who had frustrated Pareia for so long, she took a good look at Runa. He seemed to lack the strength of a warrior, but he was a veteran warrior with decent enough looks that some of the desert\u2019s young ladies would like him.</p><br/><p>Still, she decided to tease him a bit since he had caused her husband so much trouble. Runa\u2019s face turned even redder and he was at a loss of what to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrace, Runa is a warrior who is not married yet. Do not tease him too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! Why is a veteran warrior still not married? It is a big sin for a warrior to not be married. Did you not find any girls that you like in Pareia?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat...well, that\u2019s not it...I just \u2026 yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have played matchmaker for tens of warriors already. The majority of the Red Storm warriors met their wives through my introduction. Do not worry. I will find a nice young girl for you. It is tradition for a man to have a wife.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat...yes...thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian laughed while looking at Runa being so nervous and started to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cRuna claims that a warrior needs to have at least three wives even if we have to force them, so introduce him to three young ladies.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOmo! Is that so? He thinks like I do. I believe that a warrior needs to have at least five wives. As the Mother of Pareia, I guess I need to work together with Runa-nim to make that happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes...thank you very much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grace smiled once more before asking Yulian a question.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you have dinner?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot yet. The meeting was so long. Runa was so passionately speaking that everyone just continued to listen to him. Now that I think about it, I am very hungry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will prepare a meal.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Grace went to a corner of the paoe to make the food, Yulian offered Runa a seat as he started to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cTomorrow, we will build a paoe next to mine. You will live there from now on. But for today, rest here.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Runa peeked toward Grace, Yulian started to laugh as he answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha, why is a warrior who was so confident in battle so timid right now? Do not worry. I normally fulfill my duty as a husband very well so she will be understanding for one night.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! So that\u2019s the case.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Pay close attention.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two men started to laugh while exchanging some interesting words.</p><br/><p>That was the first night Runa could get a good night\u2019s rest since surrendering to Pareia.</p><br/><p>Become a patron and get advanced chapters!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

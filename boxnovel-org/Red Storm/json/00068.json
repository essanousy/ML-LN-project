Having been taught by me for ten years, he should be able to take care of this type of situation easily.\u2019</p><br/><p>Chun Myung Hoon continued to grumble, as if he was disappointed at Yulian\u2019s abilities. Although he should really be taking out five of those ten years since he was away traveling the continent, Chun Myung Hoon didn\u2019t give a damn about something like that.</p><br/><p>Since ten years have passed, it has been ten years.</p><br/><p>Although everybody else was in awe of Yulian\u2019s abilities, only Chun Myung Hoon was finding it to be inadequate.</p><br/><p>\u2018He\u2019s become weak because I stepped away for a moment. He really must have been fooling around and not training properly. I let him off easily since there were a couple things that may have been hurting him, but once this ends, I will push him harder. He was always lazy like this that I need to keep my attention on him. Ay~! I wonder if my junior felt like this as he trained his disciple.\u2019</p><br/><p>Did Chun Myung Hoon\u2019s thoughts get transferred to Yulian?</p><br/><p>While he was full of excitement and having fun while swinging his sword, he felt a murderous aura that felt like someone had poured cold water over his head.</p><br/><p>The amazing connection between the master and disciple\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Yulian realized that he was getting too excited and calmed his mind as he started to swing his two swords more elaborately. The results appeared almost instantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh.\u201d</p><br/><p>With a short groan, Recharei started to fall off his pirma. About three meters away from where he fell was a now ownerless single arm, bleeding into the sand.</p><br/><p>\u201cOowaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa~!\u201d</p><br/><p>Another thunderous noise echoed from the Pareia camp.</p><br/><p>Their Glow was able to take the arm of one of the enemy\u2019s Greatest Warriors while fighting against two enemy Greatest Warriors at once.</p><br/><p>\u201cGlow! Glow! Glow!\u201d</p><br/><p>Pareia\u2019s warriors started to chant in unison. This confirmed their belief that their Glow will become the Eastern War God.</p><br/><p>Hearing the shout of the Pareia warriors, the Greatest Warriors of the Shuarei tribe finally realized that this monster-like young warrior was Pareia\u2019s Glow.</p><br/><p>It was so chaotic and happened so quickly that nobody managed to pay attention to this young warrior\u2019s outfit.</p><br/><p>The picture of the Red Sun on his chest.</p><br/><p>It was the picture that only the Glow of Pareia was allowed to wear.</p><br/><p>Mabis and Porangso both disregarded the risk and turned their pirmas around at the same time.</p><br/><p>Nothing good would come out of holding on any longer. Yulian and Egane, who believed that they should not slash a warrior who has shown his back, just let them go before capturing the fallen Recharei. [1]</p><br/><p>\u201cValiant warriors of Pareia, the Shuarei have already fallen thanks to Neo Latin-nim\u2019s protection and our Glow\u2019s might. Now it is time for our valiant warriors to show their might.\u201d</p><br/><p>Egane shouted with a loud voice before quickly speaking to Yulian.</p><br/><p>\u201cGlow, please give the command for everyone to charge.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian quickly nodded his head and lifted his two greatswords high up in the air as he shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, CHARGE! Show them the might of Pareia!\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening to Yulian\u2019s voice that seemed to echo throughout the desert, the warriors of Pareia were full of confidence as they started to charge forward, rumbling the desert sand underneath them.</p><br/><p>Seeing one of their Greatest Warriors being captured and the other two turning their backs and retreating, it was natural for the morale of the Shuarei warriors to fall to the ground.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, since Pareia was charging forward while they were without a Greatest Warrior to command them to charge as well, they could not respond with a proper attack.</p><br/><p>In a group battle like this, especially one where it was not between infantry but where everyone was on a pirma, the side that managed to rush out first with momentum always had the advantage. That was why one of the basic knowledge was to never charge head-on against an enemy that was rushing down from a higher altitude.</p><br/><p>With the Pareia warriors, who rushed first and had the momentum, clashing against the Shuarei warriors who did not have time to gather speed, the Shuarei\u2019s formation quickly started to crumble.</p><br/><p>In the midst of that, Yulian and Red Storm\u2019s charging abilities were what you would call overwhelming. They were able to cause giant holes in the Shuarei\u2019s formation wherever they went, and the other warriors quickly followed after them to continue the assault.</p><br/><p>Porangso and Mabis believed in the fact that they had at least a couple thousand more troops and did their best to restore the formations, but it was not enough to defend against the momentum Pareia had already gained.</p><br/><p>\u201cChange formation!\u201d</p><br/><p>Without missing the opportunity, Egane shouted to the flag warriors. With the lead flag\u2019s signal, hundreds of red flags moved forward, \u00a0backward, here and there, until Pareia\u2019s formation almost instantly started to change into a straight line.</p><br/><p>On top of that, Trebol and his 5,000 warriors appeared from the back, starting to attack the Shuarei from the other direction.</p><br/><p>Being divided in half from the front and being pressured diagonally from the back, the 20,000 Shuarei warriors\u2019 formation quickly broke off into groups of a couple thousand, before all of them ended up surrounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cRetreat! Everybody retreat!\u201d</p><br/><p>Porangso and Mabis continued to shout as they ordered a retreat, but there was no path to retreat. As the warriors wandered left and right trying to find a way out, they even ended up crashing into their fellow warriors and falling over.</p><br/><p>Once Egane signaled his troops as well as Trebol with a flag, a single path of escape appeared for each surrounded group.</p><br/><p>All of the Shuarei warriors started to run for their lives.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why are they letting them go? Isn\u2019t this a good opportunity to kill them all? Was it a mistake? But both of them did it at the same time.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yulian could not understand why Egane and Trebol would let them go when they had them surrounded and could have killed them all.</p><br/><p>\u201cGlow.\u201d</p><br/><p>While he was thinking, Trebol called out and started to approach him, covered in blood from head to toe.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreatest Warrior Trebol.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian relaxed and smile as he greeted Trebol. They had won this battle.</p><br/><p>Trebol stopped his pirma next to Yulian and spoke with elation.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened? I rushed here as fast as I could, but their formations were breaking apart even before I could really get involved. Glow and Egane must have showed quite the performance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha, Egane-nim\u2019s performance was amazing. All I did was fight and shout. Whether it was the time to attack or the movement of the formation, Greatest Warrior Egane controlled all of that. Even now, the two of you commanded the troops to let them go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust the fact of having their Glow with them gives the warriors strength. You do not need to be too modest. Desert warriors need to be able to arrogantly receive some compliments as well. Plus, the Glow will become a much greater commander than us in the coming days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha, I will keep that in mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian let out a big laugh at Trebol\u2019s words and nodded his head. He then asked the question that was continuously running through his mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreatest Warrior Trebol, why is it that we opened a path for them to retreat? Wasn\u2019t this a great opportunity?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt definitely was a great opportunity. In fact, it was an opportunity for us to reduce the number of Shuarei warriors that are retreating to a tenth of the current amount.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why?\u201d</p><br/><p>Trebol finally realized that their Glow was still young. He was also very naive about war.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey say that even a mouse will bite a cat if it is pushed to a corner. With their morale down to the ground we were able to push them around as easily as we did, but if they feel that they have no way to live, they will fiercely attack and try to take as many of us down with them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen the number of injuries to our Pareia warriors will increase as well. In war, it is said that even if you manage to kill 100 enemy warriors, if 100 of your own warriors die as a result, you are a stupid commander. Even if you lost 100 warriors in the process of killing 1,000 enemy warriors, I believe a wise commander should seek a path of protecting his forces. The warriors can go crazy and kill without thinking, but the commander must never be that way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Trebol put on a tiny smile. There were moments when he wished that he was not one of the Greatest Warriors and could just be one of the warriors.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe fall into temptation many times as well. But we need to know when to hold back. That is the only way we can prepare for the next skirmish as well. I\u2019m sure you are aware that Pareia\u2019s warriors are courageous, but we do not have many of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian nodded his head at Trebol\u2019s explanation and kept this advice close to his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let us keep moving. At the end of a battle, we need to just slightly lower the warriors\u2019 excitement and fix up our formation before collecting the spoils of war and capturing any enemy who is still alive and taking them as our prisoner.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let us proceed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Trebol moved first and Yulian followed next to him, remember Trebol\u2019s every move and command to the troops.</p><br/><p>That day, Pareia earned a victory against the Shuarei in battle.</p><br/><p>This was one of their greatest successes ever.</p><br/><p>Of the 20,000 Shuarei warriors, only about half of that amount managed to successfully retreat.</p><br/><p>They also captured a large amount of approximately 5,000 warriors as prisoners, and collected the weapons, pirmas, food, and the other equipment that were left on the battlefield.</p><br/><p>The morale of Pareia\u2019s warriors pierced through the heavens, and the two Greatest Warriors sent the good news back to their individual oasis with a messenger.</p><br/><p>Once the battlefield was swept, the two Greatest Warriors discussed with Yulian once more, before allowing the warriors to have alcohol for just one night. They provided them with food, alcohol, and some free time, which excited the warriors even more to the point that it seemed difficult to lower their morale in the next few days.</p><br/><p>That was how Yulian\u2019s historic first campaign ended up as a complete success as the night started to approach.</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 4.</p><br/><p>Next Up:</p><br/><p><strong>The Meeting of the Two War Gods</strong></p><br/><p><i>The mere fact that the two of them were here together instantly made the battlefield much smaller.</i></p><br/><p>___________________________________________________________________________</p><br/><p>[1] This is different than with Recharei because that was more of a hit and run. This is more of a full on retreat.</p><br/><p>Become a patron and get advanced chapters!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

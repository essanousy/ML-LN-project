This was Yulian\u2019s way of showing his anger. Yulian declared that although they were at the vanguard, the main unit will be made up entirely of foreigner brigades. Many people had complaints about it, but did not dare to express it to Yulian. It was because they all knew that they were not the strongest soldiers their nations could offer to send. The quick-witted knight brigades had already sent a messenger back to their home nation to send extra reinforcements.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If Yulian decided on a nation and corralled all of the monsters toward that nation, a terrible destruction that would shake the foundation of a nation was certain to occur.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cRuna, the strategy meeting for the people who showed up on their own accord should have finished now right?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cYes.

It was night and day; he was pretty much feeding the knight brigades cold rice while giving the adventurers and mercenaries Pareia\u2019s VIP treatment. This was also a point of opposition, but Yulian ended the debate with a single phrase saying that it was only natural. It was his way of telling them to show a respectable amount of strength if they felt it was unfair.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Yulian said some things that could draw the ire of the other nations, but nobody tried to stop Yulian. Yulian\u2019s mental state was very shaky right now. None of them would manage to get through to him anyways.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cMake sure that there are no issues with how we treat them.

It didn\u2019t make sense for them to just suddenly decrease in number, so Yulian urgently sent some warriors to the Shire. The monsters were spawning at the Monster\u2019s Desert and the Shire\u2019s Hero\u2019s Land. It probably would not happen, but he was worried that the Hero\u2019s Land might be destroyed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The nations of the continent that received the message from the original knight brigades sent their strongest brigades to the desert, and Pareia also inserted their regular warriors as they started to investigate the Monster\u2019s Desert.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cIt feels like the number of monsters are going down day by day.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Haisha was wiping away the green blood on his greatsword as he spoke to Yulian.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cI feel the same way.

Everybody looked up out of reflex. There were dark clouds because it was starting to get late, but it was not the type of weather for it to start raining. The moment they felt like the sky flashed, a large empty area started to form in the middle of the warriors. The warriors had moved away in a circular formation for some reason.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Once Yulian and the Red Storm warriors arrived, there was a red image being drawn on the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cAll warriors move back!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Yulian felt an odd murderous aura and urgently ordered the warriors to move back</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Watching the blood colored image being drawn on the sandy ground, Yulian could tell that it was a magic circle. He had heard about it in the past from Mai. Magic circles can transport you somewhere, and an image on the ground alone can be enough to make people fall into hallucinations. The story that Yulian found most interesting was the fact that they could be used to summon monsters. And in a situation like right now where a lot of monsters were being summoned from the other world, this blood colored magic circle had to be a summoning circle. There was no way something good would pop out of it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u2018They said Shopping was afraid for his life and ran away. It would have been very dangerous at that time if master was not there. Based on the aura coming off of this magic circle, this monster is probably on the same level as that monster.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Yulian grabbed his greatsword and ordered the Red Storm to prepare for battle. He was planning on attacking the monster as soon as it was summoned, not even giving it time to realize it was out. In a situation like this where they had no idea what the monster being summoned was, that seemed to be the best course of action.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The summoning finished in an instant. It did not fall down from the sky or shoot up from underground, it just suddenly appeared as if it had been there the whole time. On first glance, it was as tall as those giants that they heard about in fairy tales. It was wearing a large grey robe fitting its height, and was holding a large scythe. They could not verify its face. The only thing they could see were black lights pouring out of where they expected its eyes to be.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cThe reaper of souls\u2026\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Aizen must have felt the ominous aura and hurried over, as Aizen quickly approached and mumbled as he looked toward this oddly dressed giant with shock.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cDo you know anything about it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Aizen responded to Yulian\u2019s question as if he was reading it out of a book.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cA devil that was born from the darkness of Chronos, son of Uranus (sky) and Gaia (earth).

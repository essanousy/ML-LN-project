Should it be called the room of someone who is already all-knowing? The image gave off the personality of the person who used the room.</p><br/><p>Then a boy, who was not wearing a luxurious outfit of a noble, but a majestic looking silk outfit with a clean design, came into the room and sat on the chair.</p><br/><p>Although this room seemed too big to use on his own, this young man had restricted anybody else from entering this room. The only person allowed in the room other than him was the mute maid who was responsible for keeping the room clean. Nobody could go against his order.</p><br/><p>There was only one person who could go against this young man\u2019s order in this place.</p><br/><p>\u201cI greet my master.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as the young man sat down, a black-clad man entered the room and bowed in front of him before speaking in a quiet voice.</p><br/><p>The young man did not even look at him, but asked while looking at the document on the table.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I ask you to please not call me master? Please just call me employer. That is more comfortable for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The black-clad man was quiet and did not say anything.</p><br/><p>Even now, there were many nobles and kings who were trying to scout him. However, the master that he decided to follow had still not accepted him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>As the young man asked, the black-clad man stopped his train of thought and quickly answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey were extremely busy building the foundation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExtremely busy...I can\u2019t understand how Pareia managed to handle that much materials. I also don\u2019t know where they would have hired so many workers. They shouldn\u2019t have that many people available.\u201d</p><br/><p>The young man was ordering the black-clad man to investigate that information.</p><br/><p>But the black-clad man had already worked with the young man for over ten years and had laid down roots in the Silence EMpire as well as throughout the entire Eastern Continent under the unbreakable trust of the young man.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have already researched all of that as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>The young man smiled at the black-clad man\u2019s response. He was a person that was easy to work with, especially to handle things that cannot be leaked to others.</p><br/><p>The black-clad man took a file out of his chest and put it on top of the young man\u2019s desk before returning to his position.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Something caught the young man\u2019s eyes as he read through the document the black-clad man provided him. He had seen a familiar name.</p><br/><p>Edwin Papent.</p><br/><p>A merchant from a slightly larger than mid-tier merchant guild who wanted to trade with the young man. He liked the man himself, but he sent him back because the guild was not the size that he was looking for.</p><br/><p>\u2018Although Pareia does not have more than 1,000,000 in population, they are a strong warrior nation with close to 800,000 warriors. It should be difficult to provide materials to such a tribe, so how? Did I perhaps misread him? Did I mistake a frog to be a tadpole?\u2019</p><br/><p>The young man was thinking about that before shaking his head. He hated thinking or worrying about things that were already over. It was not his style to do so.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><br/><p>The young man let out a snort before starting to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo the merchant guild that was said to be crossing through the desert and making a lot of money was this person\u2019s merchant guild. The rest of the business world was groaning about it\u2026...please investigate more about this person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs you command.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you not to respond like that. I am just your employer. I would to like to be related in any other way. Furthermore, I will deposit the payment for this like I have done in the past.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>\u201cThen I will be on my way now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The elf who had guided them said that before disappearing without even waiting for a response. Yulian and Aizen looked at each other before nodding their heads and started to walk to the entrance of the Magic Tower.</p><br/><p>They saw a large iron door that seemed to be at least five meters tall.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do we go in?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShould we knock on the door?\u201d</p><br/><p>While Yulian and Aizen were talking to each other, Hwai stepped forward and banged on the door with her small hands.</p><br/><p>Bang. Bang.</p><br/><p>She was still very mysterious. She just knocked a few times with her child-like hands, but the noise was so loud they could hear it echo.</p><br/><p>Aizen must already be used to it since he did not seem surprised at all. He was just waiting for a response from the Magic Tower.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuehuehue.\u201d</p><br/><p>They heard a weird laughing noise from inside the door before the large iron door started to open.</p><br/><p>Once the door opened, a weak looking old woman who did not fit the image of large iron door, was waiting for them in the middle of the entrance.</p><br/><p>The old woman had a mysterious smile toward Hwai as she started to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cHwai, the door is going to break.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou damned old hag. If you knew we were coming, you should have left the door open.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwai\u2019s tone was very rough.</p><br/><p>While Yulian and Aizen, who were hearing their conversation, were started to get nervous, the old woman motioned with her hand to call the two of them over.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll of the guests I have been waiting for have arrived.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you saying you were waiting for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Yulian asked in amazement, the old woman nodded her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was all expected. Is this our second time meeting, Aizen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, grandmother.\u201d</p><br/><p>The old woman looked at Aizen as she nodded her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve improved quite a bit. Men really do need a sense of responsibility.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI do not have time.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Aizen anxiously answered, the old woman put on another mysterious smile before responding to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright, head on in. You are prepared to solve the homework I gave you last time, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn hag. Stop making him suffer and just hand it over. Don\u2019t bother our Aizen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHwai, don\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Aizen pulled Hwai toward him as he said that.</p><br/><p>Yulian was confused while seeing that happen. It felt like Aizen and Hwai already knew the old woman, but there was something odd about the way they talked to each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay okay, you two go up first. I have something to say to this young man with the ambitious name of Desert Conqueror and War God.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAize, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>At the old woman\u2019s words, Hwai pulled Aizen forward and headed to the Magic Tower.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh...uh\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Aizen was looking at Yulian while debating what to do, but he was still being dragged by Hwai.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re meant to see him again in the future, so head on up. Don\u2019t you need to talk about Adelia?\u201d</p><br/><p>As the old woman saw how Aizen was acting and answered, Aizen\u2019s gaze suddenly changed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHyung-nim, then I will see you once things are resolved.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSounds good, Aizen. I don\u2019t know what is going on either\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Once Yulian answered, Aizen headed into the entrance of the Magic Tower with Hwai.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must be confused.\u201d</p><br/><p>As the old woman looked toward Yulian and said that, Yulian nodded his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you know my name?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI would not be a master if I didn\u2019t know the chosen ones. Huehue.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Yulian even more confused as she continued to say things that he did not understand, the old woman continued to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s head up. Aizen needs to walk up due to his promise, but since you are a guest that we have invited, I need to be courteous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou knew that I would come?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI even know your master old man Chun, so how would I not know about you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know my master?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuehue. Didn\u2019t he talk about me? About a monstrous old woman in the Magic Tower.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian shouted as if he remembered. He recalled how his master talked about meeting a old woman who might be as strong as him. He finally realized that this old woman was the one his master was talking about.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs my master here as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Become a patron and get advanced chapters!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

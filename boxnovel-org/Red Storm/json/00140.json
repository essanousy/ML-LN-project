There was also a sense of relief that they were able to see the morning sun.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Some of the people were even packing their stuff and preparing to return to the continent. They liked making the money, but they did not want to die in the middle of the night without even the mice or the birds knowing [1].</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The on-site managers of the Serubil Merchant Guild promised their safety and told them they would increase their wages due to the danger, however, nobody could stop the workers from running away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Pareia\u2019s warriors even told them they will have 2,000 guard at night, however, even that had no effect.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The number of people dying fell significantly since the first day with only two or three people dying every night now, however, there was no guarantee that they would not be one of those two or three people killed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">WIth many leaving and even the remaining workers losing their efficiency, the castle building plans were significant dented.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cMm, the situation is worse than I thought.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As Runa let out a groan and started to mumble, Pere was embarrassed. At first, he was confident that taking care of weaklings who did not even fight fairly would be easy. However, even if they remained fully alert all night, a couple of workers still ended up dying every night. It was frustrating.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Pere responded in a weak voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry.

It is my fault for not being able to come up with a proper response. Assassins from the continent were not a part of my plans.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Runa started to frown as if it was his fault.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Runa was a genius who enjoyed creating a perfect plan and then seeing everything run the way he expected it to go. He didn\u2019t have the power to control the minds of others, however, he was pretty good at leading people to the direction he wanted them to go or in a way that he could anticipate their future actions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Just like many other genii react to a crack in their plan, Runa also became nervous and short-tempered when things forced him to change his plans.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This castle construction was started even though things were not exactly how Runa had wanted it to be, however, assassins were not part of any scenarios Runa foresaw getting in their way. The closest thing to it would be moles from the continent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Runa started to think about all sorts of different scenarios since the day after the first assassinations, however, even after spending the majority of his time trying to come up with a response, he could not find a good solution.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The assassins who showed up at night were less than ten total. They all approached from different directions and attacked at the same time. Even if some of them were caught, at least one was able to assassinate some of the workers to instill the fear. They were only able to figure that out by managing to catch some of the assassins trying to stealthily enter from different directions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Apparently there were about 500 assassins, so even if they caught 10 a day, it would go on for 50 days. But if assassinations like this continued to happen every night, all of the workers would leave before the month was up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cWhat if we brought some warriors from each of the oasis to strengthen the protection of this location a little more?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Pere thought hard for a while before asking but Runa shook his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cIt would be a big hit on Pareia\u2019s fame if it gets out that we sought reinforcements because we could not take care of 500 enemies. We are a tribe that will eventually unify the desert. We cannot have anything affect our fame.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cLife is more important than fame.

Pere needed Runa\u2019s permission to increase the amount of warriors or really do anything. That was why Pere was consistently asking Runa to increase the number of warriors.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cLet me think about it for a few more days before making a decision.

If his brother was here, he would definitely have put the lives of the people first, however, Runa cared more about the greater gain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u2018I\u2019m sure he\u2019s doing well.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Pere suddenly thought about Yulian.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"></span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There was a person mumbling nonstop inside the paoe.

There were a lot of books from the continent because his father and his older brothers all were avid readers. There were even scrolls from the tribe\u2019s ancestors who wrote down their personal experiences before their death.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He even had some ancient books that he did not even know where they originated from.

In fact, they had moved the base camp over there as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe were debating whether to go in or just wait.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI had some things to do. Did the training go well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOowoooo~\u201d</p><br/><p>As Yulian responded to Haisha\u2019s question, the warriors responded loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm? What is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian had a satisfied grin on his face at their response before he noticed a Sand Dragon that was tied up with a ton of ropes and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe caught that guy alive to try to tame him like Shopping, but it wasn\u2019t as easy as we thought it would be.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Haisha proudly answered, Yulian started to laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa! How did you come up with that idea?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince there are not too many people in the Red Storm, wouldn\u2019t we be even more unstoppable if we all rode Sand Dragons instead of pirmas? If we could do that, I feel like the Red Storm alone could take on thousands of enemy warriors.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian shook his head in disbelief at Shubeon\u2019s answer.</p><br/><p>He knew that Chun Myung Hoon had personally trained the Red Storm for a while and that their skills had increased from this last war, but he never expected them to catch a Sand Dragon alive.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is a good idea, but I do not think it will be easy to do. Shopping was tamed by my master, not by me. I don\u2019t even know if it would be possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will attempt it. They say that these punks live much longer than humans, so even if we manage to tame one a year, we think it will be a good support for Pareia.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian responded to Haisha\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if we manage to tame this one, Red Storm will have to organize the troops without it. It will be hard for this guy to fight along with us and create a path for us. So if we consider the tactical value of the Red Storm, it will be better to give up on it.\u201d</p><br/><p>If you consider the large size of the Sand Dragon, it was highly likely that the Sand Dragon would also hurt their warriors in battle. So it was a double-edged sword.</p><br/><p>When he first saw Shopping, Yulian had also considered \u2018what if the entire Red Storm became Sand Dragon riders?\u2019 but he gave up on it because of this problem.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing something that they had not even considered, the Red Storm warriors were full of regret looking at the Sand Dragon they barely managed to catch alive.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut there is still value in having at least one as a symbol of the Red Storm. It\u2019ll be unfair for both the catching side and the caught side if you end up just killing it after all of that effort.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Red Storm started to smile again at Yulian\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! Haisha!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Glow.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Haisha arrived in front of Yulian, he handed the Golden Turtle back to Haisha.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is a smart one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe sure is. I had originally planned on leaving him at home, but now I\u2019ve gotten attached so I couldn\u2019t do it. But it looks like something has changed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat changed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say with certainty, but something\u2019s changed with this fella.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI fed him well and he energetically followed me around. There weren\u2019t any issues.\u201d</p><br/><p>Haisha put the Golden Turtle on his hand and looked all over it.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe i am mistaken. It must be because I have not seen him for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian nodded his head and pointed at the Sand Dragon as he started to speak to the Red Storm members.</p><br/><p>\u201cEverybody, beat him up but make sure he does not die. Beat him up until he develops obedience. If we do not instill the fact that we are above him, it will end up being dangerous, so mercilessly beat him up. Since they understand human language, watch what you say as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oowoooooo~</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce we take him to Shopping later, I\u2019m sure Shopping will teach him well. I\u2019m sure he is lonely on his own as well. But how do we tell a female Sand Dragon apart? It would be great if this one was the opposite gender of Shopping.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Red Storm all had a good laugh before sheathing their greatswords and casually walked toward the Sand Dragon that was glaring at them with murderous intent.</p><br/><p>\u2018What is going on?\u2019</p><br/><p>The Sand Dragon was surprised as the Red Storm suddenly headed toward it and flinched its body.</p><br/><p>\u201cAdjust quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Puk! Puuuuuuuuuuk. Paaaaaack. Pooooooooook.</p><br/><p>Close to 100 greatswords almost instantly started to attack the Sand Dragon.</p><br/><p>Kwaaaaaaaaaaak~</p><br/><p>As the Sand Dragon\u2019s scream echoed across the Monster\u2019s Desert, the other monsters did not dare to move around and even the one Sand Dragon that was nearby also slowly crawled into the ground.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>A man with a full head of black hair with small amounts of white hair peeking out to show his age was looking toward the Eastern sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cHohoho.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man must be happy as he started to laugh out loud.</p><br/><p>\u201cVenersis-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man turned his head as someone called out his name. It was Bucord, the leader of the Desert Sword.</p><br/><p>\u201cBucord, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre we really going to just let them do as they please?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPareia.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bucord could not reveal his frustration as he cautiously answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cPareia\u2026 Pareia...they\u2019ve gotten stronger. No, they were strong from the beginning. Our Shuarei had been aiming for them for so long but in the end, they did not fall. Amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018It is not the Shuarei but you, Venersis. If it wasn\u2019t for you, would anybody have dared to fight against pareia?\u2019</p><br/><p>Bucord thought that in his mind as he started to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we let them continue like this, we will not be able to defeat Pareia. Pareia will only get stronger as time goes on. In addition, they have a solid alliance with the Rivolde.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are slowly becoming isolated, Venersis-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know that as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even this time, Venersis looked very calm, as if it had nothing to do with him.</p><br/><p>Bucord could not understand and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you will still just leisurely sit back and watch?\u201d</p><br/><p>Venersis looked directly at Bucord.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it that we can do right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Bucord could not say anything. He wanted to say they needed to hit Pareia, but with Venersis asking like that, he realized that that wasn\u2019t really possible either.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have less than 60,000 warriors. You are not saying we should ignore the Rivolde who are eyeing us and invade Pareia, are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I am saying\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you are not planning to perish together, then it is better to just sit back and watch for now. And if we have made up our mind to sit back and watch, we need to be as quiet as a dead field mouse. We don\u2019t want to surprise them and get their anger.\u201d</p><br/><p>That truth was not something that Bucord, one of the Desert Sword, would not know. However, the diversion from above was too much.</p><br/><p>They were wondering why they were just letting Pareia be. There were even some Greatest Warriors who knew why they weren\u2019t attacking Pareia, but they were still doing it for political influence to go against Venersis.</p><br/><p>Bucord could not believe it when he saw what was going on. Was this how they treated Venersis, who had put his life on the line to fight for the Shuarei for tens of years?</p><br/><p>It had already been twenty years since Bucord started to follow Venersis. The amount of enemies who were in awe at the warrior in front of him during that time were countless, and the number of enemies who paid tribute to his endless passion and fighting spirit were endless as well.</p><br/><p>However, the tribe\u2019s Glow as well as a couple Greatest Warriors who wanted to rip him into pieces, these people were tying this glorious warrior down.</p><br/><p></p><ul style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><br/><p></p><li style=\"list-style-type: disc; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\">Go with me. I will show you the greatness of the Shuarei.</li><br/><p></p></ul><br/><p>Bucord remembered what Venersis said to him the first time he invited him to the Desert Sword. Bucord felt like tears were going to pour out of his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are your eyes turning red? Bucord.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Venersis-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand how you feel, but no matter what anybody says, we must wait. We must wait until the number of our warriors grow and Pareia shows an opening. Either that or for that Rivolde to show an opening. If our Shuarei moves on our own right now, we will perish.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSend a message to the Desert Sword. Maintain your strength, a chance will definitely come.\u201d</p><br/><p>Venersis sounded like he was urging Bucord, but in reality, he was urging himself to be patient.</p><br/><p>(As the 24th section ends)</p><br/><p>The opposition of the Magic Tower and Chaos, as well as the recreation of the world. These are both topics that will be the core of the continent chronicles.</p><br/><p>However, in order to prevent boredom, I have not put too much explanation. I will be thankful if you just accept it as \u2018So that\u2019s how it is!\u2019 I will be even more thankful if you continue to read this series as well. ^^;;</p><br/><p>The characters Aizen and the woman named Hwai Resaruche are the characters of my next project.</p><br/><p>That was why the journey to the Magic Tower was briefly described as well.</p><br/><p>If I am being honest with you, that series is a very different atmosphere than Red Storm, so there were even parts that I took out as well.</p><br/><p>Now that we are at the exact middle of the series, it is time for the main story to slowly get started.</p><br/><p>The composition of the confrontation, which is the core of the series, should not impact Yulian too much if you think about his personality and the environment around him, however!</p><br/><p>I believe that he won\u2019t be able to completely remain unaffected by this influence.</p><br/><p>Honestly, as well head into the fourth volume, the future of the characters in the story is something that even I, as the author do not know for sure, so I cannot accurately say \u2018This is what will happen!\u2019</p><br/><p>I will work hard to give you the feeling of joy and the mentality of \u2018let\u2019s get to the end together!\u2019</p><br/><p>End of chapter 1.</p><br/><p>Next up</p><br/><p><strong>Pain</strong></p><br/><p><i>Once a war ends, it leaves behind pain.</i></p><br/><p>Become a patron and get advanced chapters!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

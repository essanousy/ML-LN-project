Plus, the fact that they were a part of this commemorable war, and the experience they gained from it, will remain with them forever.</p><br/><p>It was a way to console the warriors who had been rushing the Shuarei without getting any proper rest other than the celebration after the first battle, so the strict lead warriors closed their eyes to a good amount of rowdiness, and happily celebrated as well.</p><br/><p>The three people finished by figuring out how to defend their two new oasis and returned to their residences.</p><br/><p>Yulian continued to think about that sensation he felt \u00a0even as he walked into his paoe.</p><br/><p>\u2018If this sensation is really the same as reality, the mythical undefeated streak of his can be explained if he has always had this sensation. Isn\u2019t this what you would call the greatest sensation for war?\u2019</p><br/><p>He would need to wait until the next war to see if he would feel this again, but for some reason, Yulian felt that it will not disappear.</p><br/><p>Since it was an unbelievable sensation anyways, there was nothing to say his confirmation would not be right.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about so hard?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chun Myung Hoon was waiting for Yulian in the paoe.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you wait for me? You should be resting. If you needed me, you could have called me over.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything, so why would I be tired? Plus, as you mentioned, you have become responsible for a whole tribe, so it won\u2019t look good if I keep ordering you around.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are not yourself right now Master. You\u2019re even thinking about this lowly disciple of yours.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Yulian relaxed and joked with his master, Chun Myung Hoon oddly did not change his expression and just asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat were you thinking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026 you see \u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian explained the odd sensation he felt on the battlefield to Chun Myung Hoon as well as the concerns and questions he had about it. Chun Myung Hoon responded as if he was expecting Yulian to say that.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is as I expected. What did you say his name was? The warrior who fought on par with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHis name is Venersis.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHis title?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Bloodied Hands. He used to be called the War God of the Desert until I became a bit famous and it changed to the War God of the Western Desert.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Yulian politely answered, Chun Myung Hoon nodded his head as he responded.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe plays beautifully. He was born with the Mandate of Heaven. He was also born under the Heavenly Slaughter Star.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, what does that mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chun Myung Hoon did not respond and just recalled the way Venersis moved against Yulian.</p><br/><p>The Heavenly Slaughter Star.</p><br/><p>That cursed star. There wouldn\u2019t be anybody who knows more about a cursed fate than himself. Wasn\u2019t his Chun family the family that was born with that damned star\u2019s fate?</p><br/><p>The rage of his blood was barely able to be contained through the lives of many of the church elders and his own will, but that warrior named Venersis oddly received the Mandate of Heaven, so he seemed to have some superhuman abilities to control it.</p><br/><p>\u2018Very odd. Very odd indeed.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, please explain it thoroughly to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>At Yulian\u2019s request, Chun Myung Hoon simply answered like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo not take him on by yourself again. At least until you have achieved the seven finger level of my martial arts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian was extremely shocked.</p><br/><p>After his master returned from his long trip, he asked him to show him just how hard he had been training before coming out on this campaign. When he had asked just how much he had learned, his master had raised 3 fingers as an answer.</p><br/><p>To have that master tell him not to take on Venersis until he had the strength of seven fingers. That was unbelievable.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, I am not just saying this, but today, I was on par with him. Although he looked a bit relaxed, so was I. Didn\u2019t you see it too?\u201d</p><br/><p>At Yulian\u2019s retort, Chun Myung Hoon sternly shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is because he did not feel even an ounce of danger. If he felt threatened at all, you would have been killed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he could not believe it, he had to believe it. His master had a keener eye when it came to things like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cMost importantly, when you are fighting against him, I cannot help you. Even if your life is in danger.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chun Myung Hoon\u2019s next words were most definitely a shock to Yulian. It wasn\u2019t like he was planning on relying on his master, but it would be a lie to say there wasn\u2019t a sense of security in the corner of his mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must have met me because you also have the Mandate of Heaven, and because he was born with the Mandate of Heaven, he would have reached his current strength. Because of that, I can only be a spectator. It is because I am not a person from this world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing shocking things in a row, Yulian\u2019s head was extremely confused. Not a person of this world? Then does that mean he flew in from outer space? Was his master not a human but a monster or perhaps even a ghost?</p><br/><p>All sorts of thoughts flew through Yulian\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis disciple thought he knew a decent amount about his master, but you just keep saying things I cannot understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Yulian calmed his mind and asked, Chun Myung Hoon started to speak with an understanding gaze.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you ever have any doubts about whether your master was not from this world? You never questioned how I spoke a foreign language you had never heard of in this giant place or knew martial arts that you had never seen before?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was weird for sure. But that was it. Aren\u2019t you my master who has taught me a lot of things? If it wasn\u2019t for master, the me of today will not exist as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought that it did not make sense either. But it is the truth. The reason I arrived at this place is because of the Law of Causality that humans cannot even fathom. It is the law of the world. It is not important to you right now, so we will stop talking about this here. Just don\u2019t forget your master\u2019s words. Do not face him on your own.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand, master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian was feeling discontent, but knew he needed to listen.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Now that Pareia is a bit more settled, you must further your martial arts. Only then can I leave in peace.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are planning on going somewhere again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have not completely figured out the reason I arrived here. I am only traveling to figure that out. But my home in this world is still this desert, so I will not be gone forever. Why? Are you sad?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chun Myung Hoon smiled at Yulian\u2019s answer. It wasn\u2019t bad to hear.</p><br/><p>\u201cWork a little harder. Since you are now the Glow, you will not have as much time, but how can the tribe get stronger if you are weak?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI must work hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian also smiled as he answered.</p><br/><p>It was a night when the moon was shining exceptionally brightly.</p><br/><p>End of chapter.</p><br/><p>Next Up:</p><br/><p><strong>Unity and Pet Animal</strong></p><br/><p><i>Our hearts were broken.</i></p><br/><p><i>But thanks to that pain, we became even closer.</i></p><br/><p><i>In addition, Shopping\u2019s charm made it impossible to stop laughing.

Although Pere was confused, he felt like he shouldn\u2019t touch him and removed his hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you awake? Is your condition really bad?\u201d</p><br/><p>Many questions of concern were coming out of Pere\u2019s mouth. This was surprising, because it was difficult for Yulian to hear anything from Pere normally. Unfortunately, Yulian could not respond.</p><br/><p>Pere made up his mind and nodded his head as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. As long as you are alive, that\u2019s all that matters. Just hold on a little bit longer. The Rivolde Oasis is not much further!\u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s what Pere was telling Yulian, but he knew that the road to Rivolde was still long.</p><br/><p>No matter how quickly they rode, it would take at least three days to reach Rivolde, the closest Oasis to Pareia.</p><br/><p>He was worried that Yulian could not last that long, and he was also worried because they would need to cross the Shuarei\u2019s territory to get there. Normally, they would use the northern route, but they were not in the condition to do so right now. They needed to take the fastest route possible.</p><br/><p>Pere started to first push the pirma forward. He might as well travel as he was trying to figure things out. He believed that Grace would soon arrive with reinforcements and the shamans, but he was also worried about that.</p><br/><p>If the evil Librie arrived first and started to take control\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Even Pere knew that if Yuiian is not there, the command would fall to Librie. Plus, Librie would not have stupidly started this rebellion without thinking things through\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Pere was filled with worries as he continued forward.</p><br/><p>The sun started to rise, but Pere\u2019s mind was still the same terrible nightmare.</p><br/><p>How far must he have traveled?</p><br/><p>The sun was high above his head.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s tiring.\u2019</p><br/><p>Since Grace had prepped the pirma only for a night riding session, there were no water on the pirma. Pere was using his strong mental skills to survive the murderous sun\u2019s heat and continue forward.</p><br/><p>Truthfully speaking, crossing the desert without a turban (a hat made by wrapping a cloth around your head), and without any water, was suicide. However, Pere did not despair.</p><br/><p>He knew that his guardian god will help him.</p><br/><p>He had faith and believed that Neo Latin will not abandon him, especially after he had been giving a prayer of abstaining from alcohol. Pere had full confidence in his will to live.</p><br/><p>At that moment, he saw a cloud of sand in the distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>If it was Grace, it should be coming from the back, not from the front.</p><br/><p>Pere grabbed the hilt of his shamshir tightly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn.\u2019</p><br/><p>Pere swore inside once he figured out who the main characters inside the sand clouds were.</p><br/><p>Before he could see any of the people inside, he saw the large blue flag and the shamshir that was drawn on it.</p><br/><p>It was the Desert Sword, the brigade of Shuarei\u2019s \u2018Bloodied Hands,\u2019 Venersis. As he was rushing forward lost in thought, he must have already ended up in the Shuarei\u2019s territory.</p><br/><p>Even if he would have tried to run away, the pirma was tired.</p><br/><p>It was not surprising.</p><br/><p>It had run so far carrying two people.</p><br/><p>\u2018If I don\u2019t have a way to escape, I must meet them and leave everything to the will of the heavens. I\u2019m sure we will not die.\u2019</p><br/><p>Although they met their bitter enemies, Pere felt himself being surprisingly calm and rested. He had a weird confirmation that even if something even more severe than this were to happen, he would not die.</p><br/><p>The Desert Sword soon surrounded Pere and Yulian. They looked to be around fifty people.</p><br/><p>It was as if they were waiting for someone.</p><br/><p>Pere still did not lose his calm expression, and started to spin the shamshir in his hand.</p><br/><p>But suddenly, he felt an overwhelming pressure; that wind of pressure quickly attacked Pere.</p><br/><p>Pere\u2019s eyes opened widely as he turned his head towards the direction of the wind.</p><br/><p>Who would dare to show this type of pressure to him?</p><br/><p>If he was go to one on one with their lives on the line, he was confident that he would not even lose to his brother.</p><br/><p>Pere could see a middle aged man around his size slowly approaching him on a large pirma.</p><br/><p>Pere turned his body towards this man, who was still trying to oppress him while giving off an air of piercing through everything. Then, as if to say he could do just as much, he opened up his chest and lowered his shamshir in front of him as he glared at the man.</p><br/><p>The man seemed to be both surprised and flattered by Pere, and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a sense of danger coming from each and every one of his words.</p><br/><p>It felt similar to his father\u2019s voice when he was angry.</p><br/><p>However, he had no plans on tricking himself.</p><br/><p>Pere overcame the danger he sensed and shouted loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am the second son of Pareia\u2019s \u2018Benevolent Eye\u2019 Baguna Provoke, the \u2018Great Strength\u2019 Pere Provoke. Who is the warrior addressing me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man nodded his head.</p><br/><p>It was a name that he kept hearing these days.</p><br/><p>The two sons of Pareia were extremely talented. The eldest son caught a sand dragon on his own and the second son was known as an extremely strong individual who could defeat anybody he faced.</p><br/><p>If it was a warrior with that much fame, it seemed fine to tell him his name.</p><br/><p>The man answered in a quiet yet powerful voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am Venersis, the \u2018Bloodied Hands,\u2019 of the Shuarei\u2019s strength, the Desert Sword.\u201d</p><br/><p>TO BE CONTINUED</p><br/><p>That\u2019s it folks. We have come to the end of Volume 1 after 334 pages and 3.5 months. It\u2019s been 100 days, so I\u2019d say I\u2019ve been translating at a rate of 3.34 pages a day. Whether that is fast or not, I\u2019m not quite sure, but I\u2019m quite happy to have finished volume 1. As mentioned a few weeks ago, I will be taking a week off; after that we will see the start of Book 2! See you all in a week!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

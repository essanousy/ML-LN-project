But the first person to oppose Yulian\u2019s decision was Runa.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Red Storm needed to remain as the Red Storm.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Runa indicated that he wanted to plant the seed in Pareia\u2019s warriors about the undefeated record of the Red Storm Warriors. He thought that this was absolutely necessary to make the warriors believe that they could not lose a war in which the Red Storm was with them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">So then why were they in front of the groups of warriors right now? They were just standing there in place of the Greatest Warriors and Lead Warriors for this training. This allowed the Greatest Warriors and Lead Warriors to observe their brigade\u2019s formations and inspect the condition of all of the warriors in their brigade.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Pareia\u2019s battle formation revolved around each Greatest Warrior in charge of 10,000 warriors, with 10 Lead Warriors each in charge of 1,000 warriors, and 10 veteran warriors reporting to the lead warriors as squad leaders in charge of 100 warriors each.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">These veteran warriors may each have 100 warriors they are responsible for, but if there were more than 10 veteran warriors in the Lead Warrior\u2019s team, they personally determined seniority amongst the veteran warriors.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Since the chain of command was set up in layers of 10, it was easy to be able to concentrate on how the formations were doing, rather than focusing on all 10,000 warriors at once.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thanks to this, the leaders were able to easily remember the problem areas or personally go and fix the issue to make their formation inch closer toward perfection. The goal of these trainings that they were doing right now was to perfect the formation at the 100 warrior level.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cForward!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Once the flag warriors shouted loudly and started to signal with their flags, the four brigades made of 10,000 warriors started to increase their speed.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was not just an ordinary forward march. They were paying attention to how long they could move while maintaining their formation. The difference between \u2018forward\u2019 and \u2018charge\u2019 was that during a \u2018charge,\u2019 it did not matter whether you remained in formation. That was just an all out charge to defeat as many enemies as possible.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Seeing as how they could maintain their formation even while 40,000 warriors were running at the same time, you could clearly tell how much the warriors had been training these last few months.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cWow~ it\u2019s really amazing. I\u2019ve never seen so many warriors move together in formation like this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Shubeon maintained the proper distance to the warriors following behind him as he admired this amazing feat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cWhat is even more amazing are the Greatest Warriors like Egane-nim who can maintain a good grasp of all of these warriors.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Hearing one of the other Red Storm warriors comment, Shubeon nodded his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cThat is why they are our Greatest Warriors. Their strength alone is one thing, but this ability to maintain a good grasp of all of these warriors. I wonder if this broad perspective ability is actually their greatest strength. I\u2019m glad our Red Storm only has one command: Charge. Hehehe.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As Shubeon mentioned, having this. Broad perspective was a requirement of becoming a Greatest Warrior. Although Shubeon had enough strength to rival the Greatest Warriors, when it came to leading a group of warriors like this, Shubeon would be like a pina in front of a wild animal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cJust focus. They will issue another command soon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Another Red Storm warrior eyed the flag warrior before warning Shubeon. The warriors in the front had an important role. They needed to be the first to respond to the flags.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cChange.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As the command finally came, the formation slowly started to change to a fast but safe formation. As they were changing formations and created a half circle formation, a new command was issued.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cBreak.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The half circle formation instantly broke down into the four different groups and separated into north, south, east, and west.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cCross.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The flag warriors waved their flags and the dispersed warriors ran toward each other before ending up in the original straight line formation. It really was extremely accurate.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even though they were running at a fast speed, they managed to properly pass by each other and get into formation. This type of training was so amazing even in the eyes of people who did not know anything about war.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They needed to be extremely accurate in order to defeat 120,000 with just 40,000 warriors; that was the reason Pareia had committed to such difficult training for the warriors.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They had their Glow who was the War God of the Eastern Desert, as well as a special brigade that was able to handle over 10,000 enemies with just 50 people. They also had their Assistant Warrior who had made both their Glow and that special brigade become full of admiration. With all of these factors, Pareia\u2019s morale was piercing through the sky right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They knew the enemy had numbers that were multiples of their own, but none of them thought that they could lose. In fact, they had so much confidence that the lead warriors had to caution them to stay cautious.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cIt is amazing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Runa, who had been watching all of this on a high sand dune nearby, started to speak to Yulian who had been watching next to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cDidn\u2019t all of this come out of your head?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cEven still, I never expected them to accomplish it so perfectly like this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Runa shook his head before responding to Yulian\u2019s question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cTraining exercises like this have been the focal point of our Greatest Warriors for a long time. In order to fight against the Shuarei\u2019s Venersis, our third generation Greatest Warriors needed to be in full control of the situation.

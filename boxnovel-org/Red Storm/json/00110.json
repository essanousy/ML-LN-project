Please share the things that you have thought about and then follow the things that we decide on in this meeting. Furthermore, I am naming Runa Brink as my assistant warrior starting today. He will start to participate in the Greatest Warrior Meeting from here on out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once Yulian introduced him, Runa stood up from his seat and greeted everyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy name is Runa Brink. Please take good care of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Many of them were stumped at Runa\u2019s greeting.</p><br/><p>The anger from knowing just how much sacrifice Pareia had to make because of this man, the relief from knowing that he was now one of Pareia\u2019s people, as well as the remaining thread of connection to the Wikaly for the former Wikaly chiefs.</p><br/><p>The Wikaly Glow had pretty much selected a bath of destruction by throwing away Abham and Runa.</p><br/><p>Runa and Yulian must have discussed it beforehand, as Runa did not sit back down and started to bring up the topics for discussion.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnder the order of the Glow, I will be leading this meeting. The most urgent issue right now is the protection of the oases. There are only 80,000 warriors left in Pareia right now. We are lacking too many warriors in relation to the number of oases we hold. Pareia did not have a bad relationship with the Oklama up north, but there were some friction during this last war. As a result, it would be smart to consider them as enemy territory now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Runa put the map of the desert that he had prepared in advance at the middle of the table.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat means that the problem we face is how to handle the Shuarei to the south, the Oklama to the north, as well as the potential hostile forced from the Silence Empire. Thankfully, the Shuarei will take at least two or three years to return to the 60,000+ warriors they used to have.\u201d</p><br/><p>Runa stopped talking for a moment before continuing on.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn addition, the Silence Empire to the east is currently being pressured by a kingdom called the Rojini Kingdom. So I believe it is safe to say that they will not be a big problem for a while. As a result, my suggestion is that we throw away the two oases closest to the Shuarei, as well as the two oases closest to Oklama.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as Runa stopped talking, the chiefs all started to whisper with one another.</p><br/><p>This was especially true for the chiefs of the oases Runa suggested they throw away. These chiefs started to angrily shout.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes that make any sense? Why would we throw away any oasis when people are all trying to earn more oasis?\u201d</p><br/><p>None of the Chiefs, and even Yulian, could not understand Runa\u2019s intent. Only Egane was lightly nodding his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo we have the strength to protect them? Do we have the strength to protect twenty oases with 80,000 warriors?\u201d</p><br/><p>Runa glared at the chiefs as he continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe more we split up our warriors, the harder it will be to gather them. It will also be harder to handle any sudden attacks by the enemy. I will not say this if someone is capable of defending against 20,000 enemy warriors with just 5,000. Is anybody confident that they can do that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Runa\u2019s words were not wrong, the chiefs who believed it made no sense to throw away an oasis started to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven so, to throw away four oases. We all sacrificed so much to earn those four oases. What would we say to our warriors?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince we have more women and children in the tribe, our number of warriors should quickly increase again. Why must we give them up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter what your reason may be, it does not make sense.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian lifted up his hand to make people stop talking and then asked Runa.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease break it down and explain it to us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is exactly as I said. Keeping oases that are difficult to defend will not strengthen us. It will instead weaken us little by little. Rather than let that happen, it would be better to focus on our internal affairs to build up the necessary strength to defend them before we go get them back. Furthermore, even if we throw those oases away, the Shuarei cannot take them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd why would that be the case?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t even have 60,000 warriors. Do you think they will have the strength to occupy another oasis? The oases they have right now will be enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd what if the Shuarei end up taking them?\u2019</p><br/><p>Runa looked toward Yulian and the chiefs before starting to smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think the Glow will just let that happen? If you consider the Shuarei\u2019s current situation, they will only be able to gather around 10,000 warriors for an attack.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it is a type of trap?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is not the main goal, but it can end up being that way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what do you plan to do about the Oklama?\u201d</p><br/><p>Runa quickly answered Egane\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe would not be giving it to them for free. In return for the oases, we must get a promise of mutual non-aggression for a couple of years. The Oklama will not be able to reject this offer. If they had the desire to fight, they will have shown their teeth at our last interaction. Since they didn\u2019t, it shows that they are wary of us as well. In a situation like that, if they can gain two oases by agreeing to mutual non-aggression, that would be a great gain for them. We would also buy ourselves some time to focus on our internal affairs. Since Pareia\u2019s population is now close to around 800,000, which means that we should be able to gain around 10,000 new warriors in about three years time. It will continue to increase quickly after that. The most important thing right now is to not lose any warriors during that time.\u201d</p><br/><p>The gazes of everyone in the paoe had all focused on Runa.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have made many plans to make Pareia into a strong nation, and to make strong warriors in exactly 20 years.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe most urgent issue is the ratio between men and women. This is an issue for all tribes and not just Pareia, but Pareia\u2019s ratio is too severe. We need to get it to at least a 1:3 ratio so that we do not lack warriors in the future. This is something that we need to enforce for a long time to fix, so we need to make the warriors take at least three wives even if we need to force them to do so. If we start now, I believe we will be able to see the effects of it in twenty years.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTwenty years?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is the shortest amount of time to get certain results. This is also something that we need for after we unify the desert. Population is tied to the strength of a nation. If it is something we can get started on now, it is better to start now than to wait.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018He has the same thoughts as Grace and her five wives to a warrior opinion.\u2019</p><br/><p>That was what Yulian thought about as he heard Runa speak. The thing that Grace continued to emphasize was the fact that warriors needed to have at least 5 wives.\u201d</p><br/><p>Honestly speaking, he thought it was normal to have two or three wives, but he has not said anything about it because it would feel like they were shoving girls at the warriors if he publicly proclaimed it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe second issue is the economy. I know this is a touchy subject, but please allow people to own private property.\u201d</p><br/><p>The chiefs started to whisper once more at Runa\u2019s words. It was a really dangerous thing to accept private property.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe cannot do that. If we accept private property, there is a chance that the warriors\u2019 loyalty will go down. Furthermore, Pareia provides the most to our citizens compared to any other tribe, so why would we approve of private property?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Shamba, the chief of the sandless oasis jumped up and shouted, Runa lowered his head once before looking around at Yulian and the other chiefs.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am saying relinquish that control. Rather than using allocations to earn loyalty, develop trust with each of them, person to person. Give them dreams and hopes. If it is our warriors, I know that they can be twice as effective as they currently are. You need to accept that the reason the desert cannot stand up to the continent economically is because we do not allow private property. Securing multiple oases have guaranteed us the minimal requirements to survive; this is the only way for the entire tribe to get stronger.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRuna, that is extremely difficult and complicated to do. Have you thought about how many issues we may have to change the tribe into one that allows private property? Talking about the biggest issue first, the warrior spirit will shake if they are fighting for something other than the tribe. Second, what would we use to trade? We do not have any type of commerce system set up and the things that we can sell are limited.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian had not been lazy with his studies until now. He had been using books from the continent to learn about business, economics, history, geography etc, so he knew the strengths and weaknesses of a limited market like the one they had.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know what the Glow\u2019s concerns are. However, didn\u2019t you say that a merchant from a large merchant guild goes through here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you talking about Edwin? We have created a path for him. We have also received a lot of help from him as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe volume of the East-West trade is beyond our expectation. The volume that the merchant named Edwin moves pales in comparison. It is like a single piece of sand in a sand dune. We need to expand the trade route and bring in as many merchants as possible so that they compete with each other. Tell them to research the things they can take from the desert, while asking them to give us the things we need. In return, their safety will be guaranteed and promise them they will receive huge profits. If we do that, then commerce will naturally be created in our oasis as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Watching Runa continue to talk without stopping, everyone could see just how much he had prepared for this meeting.</p><br/><p>But they still needed to be careful about the things they needed to be careful about. Not everything in the world would go the way they want it to go.</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand that the assistant warrior has prepared a lot for this meeting, however, isn\u2019t it too much? There are so many things we need to take care of right away. If we announce that we are approving private property right now, it will cause chaos and slow down our speed to get other things done. How about we do not do this now, and wait until Pareia\u2019s foundations have solidified? I don\u2019t think it would be a bad idea to start it at that point.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yarumaha started to speak.</p><br/><p>Thinking about it holistically, he also believed that allowing private property would raise the efficiency of the warriors significantly. However, this was not the time.</p><br/><p>For someone like him who had already been infected by Yulian\u2019s passion, private property was something he would not even dream about.</p><br/><p>Runa poured out his disagreement.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we don\u2019t do it now, when would we do it? This is the time Pareia needs to do everything we can. I hope you are not saying we should start it once we unify the desert. If we are one year late in doing something now, it will make our dream at least ten years further away. We do not have that much time. We cannot waste any time like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Runa looked around at Yulian and the chiefs before bowing 90 degrees. As all of them became confused about why Runa was doing that, he started to speak again.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease trust me and leave it to me. I have made preparations for all possible issues. This Runa Brink has seen the Glow\u2019s dream and the passion of Pareia. I too have had problems sleeping at night knowing that I am taking part in such a grand vision.\u201d</p><br/><p>Runa ended his bow and looked back to ward Yulian.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou promised that I would be able to use all of my abilities. And I promised that I will do everything I can to help set the foundation for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI did promise you that.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Yulian nodded his head and confirmed, Runa seemed to have received some strength as he started to try and convince the chiefs again.</p><br/><p>Become a patron and get advanced chapters!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

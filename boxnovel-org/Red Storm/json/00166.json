They might be working well together as a united tribe, but if they went with this plan, Kinicks\u2019s oasis, which was the closest oasis to the land route, would be completely eaten up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The three Glows discussed all night to figure out the best course of action.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u00a0</span><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"></span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Normally, the desert tribes participated in an exchange of prisoners or discussed a ransom for the prisoners with each other during times of war.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With it being normal to become absorbed into the other side when you surrender and become a prisoner, you may ask \u2018is there a reason to even negotiate?\u2019 but that is only when one side absorbed an entire oasis.

However, Pareia rejected it. It was because Pareia had plans on absorbing all oases in the Eastern Desert with this war. Because of that, they did not agree to negotiations for the prisoners and just sent them to different oases to live with Pareia\u2019s warriors.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They will not become Pareia\u2019s warriors immediately, but as time goes by, they will end up becoming Pareia\u2019s warriors. If they manage to safely finish this war of unifying the Eastern Desert, they will officially become Pareia\u2019s warriors.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Second month of year 259 in the continental calendar.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As 10,000 warriors led by Egane arrived at the border of the united tribe, Yulian and 30,000 warriors also arrived on land through the quicksand river.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was the official start of the Eastern Desert wars.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"></span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cAll units, attention!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Buchord, the leader of the Desert Sword, as well as the Assistant Warrior to Venersis, the Shuarei\u2019s overall commanding officer, shouted out loud to the group. The 40ish Greatest Warriors and lead warriors who were in the area heard the order and started to stand at attention. Once they were ready, a shabby looking Venersis finally appeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Venersis didn\u2019t seem to be his usual self.

His command was pretty much the will of the Glow as long as it was something relating to war. That was the type of power the Glow had given him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of the people gathered here were warriors that Venersis had personally selected. There were a lot of grumblings during his selection process, but there should be no problems. It was because the person who gave him the power to do so was none other than Elbotta, the Shuarei\u2019s Glow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Venersis could feel his heart beating loudly. It was because it had been a long time since he fought for a Lord who trusted him.

It was because it would be a war he could unleash everything he had.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Venersis\u2019s heart continued to beat quickly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cTo be honest with you, I was against this war.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Everyone had a look of confusion at Venersis\u2019s choice of first words, but that was only for a moment.

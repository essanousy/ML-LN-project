Grace moved back and took out the two Sosoonta (short swords with a curved blade) from her thighs, holding one in each hand before bending her hips and taking an attacking stance.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is the meaning of this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian was surprised as he asked Grace, and she lifted her shoulder once to answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs I indicated, a match. Throw away the thought of going easy on me because i am a woman. I am letting you know now that I am a warrior of Rivolde, who completed the men\u2019s coming-of-age ceremony with a woman\u2019s body.\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening to Grace indicate that she was approved as a warrior, Yulian could not believe it.</p><br/><p>\u2018What tribe would make a woman complete the coming-of-age ceremony? Especially since the Rivolde tribe is the strongest tribe in the West\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Of course the women of the desert had strong personalities, and since the temperament of the desert tribes were fierce in nature, there were women who took part in hunting as well, but earning the badge of adulthood through the coming-of-age ceremony, as well as participating in the tribal wars were the men\u2019s job.</p><br/><p>It was their job to protect the young boys who had yet to become warriors, and the women, not to fight alongside them.</p><br/><p>\u201cReveal your reasoning. Pareia warriors do not fight without reason.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you win, I will let you know the reason.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grace answered like that before quickly starting to attack Yulian in her crouched position.</p><br/><p>Yulian lightly swung his greatsword in response, but Grace lowered her body even more to make the greatsword swing above her head, and continued to get closer, with a movement that looked like she was crawling.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d</p><br/><p>Her movement was so fast that Yulian was shocked before using the greatsword in his left hand to stab into the sand and lift his body up. Just a second later, Grace\u2019s Sosoonta passed by, scratching Yulian\u2019s greatsword.</p><br/><p>Yulian felt a slight bit of anger at the fact that he almost had his body slashed, and yelled.</p><br/><p>\u201cReveal the reason for this battle. If you do, I will accept that you are a warrior and fight you seriously.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you I will let you know if you win?\u201d</p><br/><p>As if trying to taunt Yulian, Grace spoke informally, before using the Sosoonta\u2019s speed and sharpness to attack Yulian again.</p><br/><p>The attack was too accurate to go easy on her for being a woman, and as the opponent has indicated they have received the badge of adulthood, Yulian decided to not go easy on her.</p><br/><p>Yulian reduced his power in half and started to swing his greatsword. (TL: Decides not to go easy on her, so reduces his power in half. What the heck\u2026)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want to give up, feel free to do so at any time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look down on me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grace was angered at Yulian\u2019s warning, and instead started to go at Yulian even harder.</p><br/><p>A battle between a large greatsword and a Sosoonta the size of two hands put together was very abnormal, but Grace seemed to have a considerable amount of skills. Yulian could not help but to also use the greatsword in his left hand every so often.</p><br/><p>After they clashed approximately twenty times?</p><br/><p>Grace, who had been nimbly dodging Yulian\u2019s greatsword could not avoid the greatsword in Yulian\u2019s left hand which arrived almost instantly, and had to use both of the Sosoonta\u2019s together to block.</p><br/><p>\u201cClang.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since it was a training greatsword, the blade was not sharp, but as if it increased the strength, the single greatsword and the two Sosoontas made a sharp clashing noise, and Grace was pushed back from the strength of the greatsword, leading her to slide far back in the same posture, with the two Sosoontas in front of her.</p><br/><p>Annoyed that she might attack again, Yulian chased after Grace who was sliding back and swung his greatsword once more in the exact spot the two Sosoonta\u2019s overlapped. Grace lost her balance and fell back, as if she slipped.</p><br/><p>Yulian felt like he might have been too harsh and quickly ran after her and helped her get back up.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>In a very evident change in personality, Grace received Yulian\u2019s help without saying anything, and stared at him as if trying to look deep into his soul, before kneeling down and bowing her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you suddenly doing this?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Yulian nervously brought her back up, Grace answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you not know who I am?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen you within our tribe before\u2026 Have we met before?\u201d</p><br/><p>Thinking that the other person knew who he was, Yulian tried to think hard about who the woman is, but he could not remember at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrace Nellisi. You\u2019re telling me you\u2019ve never heard of this name before?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Grace asked again, Yulian started to think carefully.</p><br/><p>\u2018Grace Nellisi\u2026 Grace Nellisi...Rivolde tribe\u2019s Nellisi family\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>A thought quickly flew by in Yulian\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u2018If it is the Nellisi family of the Rivolde tribe, the only one is the family of the Glow.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yulian was skeptical as he asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is your relationship with the Great Glow Dejaine of the Rivolde tribe?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe happens to be my father.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, then\u2026 you must be the beautiful maiden Grace\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As he was about to finish his sentence, a lightbulb went off in Yulian\u2019s head and he remembered his father, Glow Baguna\u2019s words before he made a terrified expression.</p><br/><p>- I will proceed with the marriage between you and the daughter of the Rivolde Glow.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As Yulian had a shocked expression and could not continue his words, Grace smiled before answering.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you have heard. I was afraid that you might not remember. The Rivolde tribe\u2019s Beautiful Maiden, Grace Nellisi, makes her formal introduction to her fiance, Pareia tribe\u2019s Young Glow, the Desert Conqueror, Yulian Provoke-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Grace\u2019s words, the Red Storm Warriors, who were surrounding them screamed in delight. It wasn\u2019t bad to see the woman who will end up the Mother of Pareia in the future.</p><br/><p>Yulian\u2019s face was red in embarrassment as he opened his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is it that you are here \u2026 wait, did you come alone?\u201d</p><br/><p>Grace nodded her head and replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I came by myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor what reason did you come here\u2026 does the Great Glow Dejaine Nellisi know of this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course he does not. If he did, I\u2019m sure even my father who dotes on me dearly would not have approved.\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening to Grace answer as her cheeks became red and she cracked a smile, Yulian felt his heart beating wildly and turned his head away.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe reason I came to look for Pareia\u2019s Young Glow today was to see the man who will be my husband. I could not get married to a warrior who was weaker than me, could I?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Grace continue, Yulian became a mute who ate a lot of honey, and the surrounding warriors let out a holler. (TL: Remember, Korean saying similar to cat got your tongue.)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf...I had lost\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As Yulian squirmed while speaking, Grace answered with a confident, yet warm voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you were weaker than me, no matter what, I would have broken off the engagement. However, after seeing that Yulian-nim is very strong, I realize that my thoughts were wrong from the beginning. You truly deserve the title of the Desert Conqueror and I, Grace, am very relieved.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Ha!\u2019</p><br/><p>Yulian was flabbergasted at Grace\u2019s answer. Even if she is a woman of the desert, how could she come and test her future husband.</p><br/><p>The more flabbergasted Yulian was, the surrounding warriors continued to increase their joyous hollering.</p><br/><p>Grace coyishly stood next to Yulian and bowed to the Red Storm warriors.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am sorry that I interrupted the training of Pareia\u2019s strong warriors. However, I was so curious that I came like this, I ask that the warriors not scold this rebellious lady too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWah!Wah!Wah!\u201d</p><br/><p>As the warriors continued to shout in joy, one of the warriors, Quick Two Feet Chenji Warita spoke as he shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are just sorry we are showing such shabby selves to the future Mother of Pareia. I, Chenji, along with the rest of the Red Storm warriors, pray dearly that the Beautiful Maiden Miss Grace will quickly marry and arrive at Pareia.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grace showed no embarrassment to many men cheering for her and bowed her head again.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. I too will be waiting and hoping that the day arrives quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian felt that his face will turn into a tomato if he stayed there any longer and moved away before speaking (TL: the actual statement is that his face will blow up red, but I thought the tomato was a good comparison).</p><br/><p>\u201cSince a guest has arrived, we cannot just stay like this. Let\u2019s head into the Paoe. Mother and Father will be happy to know that you have arrived.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Yulian headed off disrespectfully without even looking back, seeing his awkward steps, Grace smiled, as if she knew what was going through his mind, and said a final farewell to the warriors before following after him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am looking forward to quickly being a part of Red Storm\u2019s training. Then, I shall meet you all again in the near future.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was obvious that the warriors would shout like they were crazy.</p><br/><p>(TL: I debated between continuing with Sir instead of -nim, but after reading some other Korean novels, I want to stay true to the language. So you will be seeing a shift from Sir Yulian to Yulian-nim.)</p><br/>\n</div>"}

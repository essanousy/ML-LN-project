Although Pareia has elected a new Glow, their usually strong organization is probably faltering. Since the Shuarei have proceeded at this time, the Wikaly tribe must attack as well. They are likely to put more of their forces toward the Shuarei than us. This is our chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am also aware of that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Abham nodded his head again at Runa Brink\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why are we still sitting here like this? An opportunity like this is not easy to come by.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRuna.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Abham-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should have followed a better warrior than me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Runa was confused at Abham\u2019s words and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Abham responded in a sorrowful voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like a beggar clutching tightly to gold. Can\u2019t use it as they want and end up dying without using it at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAbham-nim!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the story of my life. Even while having a young man like you by my side, I am still like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHas the Shining Shamshir already rusted? Why are you suddenly saying such weak words?\u201d</p><br/><p>Abham let out a long sigh as he answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cI told the Glow a long time ago. I told him that we should attack Pareia at the same time as the Shuarei.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was cleanly rejected. Glow Gomai-nim has too much fear. No, he\u2019s just too complacent with the present. All he said to me was about how no good can come from messing with Pareia, the strongest in the East.\u201d</p><br/><p>Runa responded with disappointment.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou need to convince him. For how long must our Wikaly walk on eggshells around Pareia? If we manage to take away just two oasis from them, as time goes on, we will no longer need to be afraid of Pareia.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI may be one of the Greatest Warriors, but my foundation is weak. Even during the meeting of the chiefs, my influence is weak. That is why I am saying you could have done bigger things if you served someone else.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can you say something like that? This Runa Brink is someone who has pledge to spend my whole life with the Shining Shamshir after falling for your greatness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Abham shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou picked wrong. You should have selected a chief with a little more influence. I don\u2019t have the power to push for your request.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAbham-nim!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still not too late. Go look for a different Greatest Warrior. Someone who can let you show your skills as much as you want.\u201d</p><br/><p>Runa looked toward Abham and his weak response with sad eyes. He was someone who had spent his whole life as a warrior. He knew how to stay loyal to his mission and how to properly handle his prestige. He was a man among men. But could the passing of time really make him become like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Day after day, that bright shine started to disappear. The person who used to confidently shout that he would make Wikaly into the greatest tribe, that person who was so full of vigor, was starting to change little by little.</p><br/><p>But he was someone who had made up his mind to serve this man since the day he completed his coming-of-age ceremony. Wasn\u2019t he the person who recognized his skills more than anybody else? Abham had treasured him even more than his parents had done.</p><br/><p>Men of the desert had to be strong above all else. But he was such a weakling, so weak that people worried whether he could even complete his coming-of-age ceremony. It was to the point where many of the tribe members even ignored him. It was only this man who believed in his dreams and his abilities.</p><br/><p>\u201cAbham-nim, please don\u2019t give up. Aren\u2019t we slowly building that foundation? One day, this will become the strongest oasis of the Wikaly tribe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven that is thanks to you. But we do not own much, and our oasis is the smallest of the tribe. There are limitations to what we can achieve. I want to put my hope in my future generations, but they all have rocks for brains. All they know how to do is to envy others.\u201d</p><br/><p>Runa put on a bitter smile. As Abham mentioned, it would have been great if his sons were even half the man Abham was. But Abham\u2019s sons already did not have a good relationship with Abham.</p><br/><p>Part of it was because Abham doted on him too much and didn\u2019t pay attention to his children, but even down to the basics, whether it was character or abilities, they were nothing in comparison to Abham.</p><br/><p>\u201cI believe that is my job. It is because I have not shown my skills yet. Once they know about your sincerity and my skills just a bit, we can take care of this issue quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Abham shook his head at Runa\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf they knew who was responsible for making our oasis as plentiful as it is now, they will not be able to act the way they are acting right now. Once my sons follow in my footsteps, you will just end up not having any power in the oasis. You need to go find a different chief or Greatest Warrior to serve before that happens.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere would I go if I left your side, Abham-nim? I\u2019m someone who is useless other than for my somewhat decent brain.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Avignon of the Rising Moon Oasis seems to have a keen eye for people. He is trying to take you. Although I don\u2019t like the things he does, he is still has the most influence after the Glow. Go to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Runa let out a laugh as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa! You want me to go to that old man? As soon as I get there, I will not be able to deal with my temper and kill myself. The complaints from his vice chiefs and warriors are known in our oasis as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut he is also the person who can put you to the best use. I already brought it up to him casually last time, so he\u2019s probably salivating about it by now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Runa\u2019s eyes were full of seriousness as he responded to Abham.</p><br/><p>\u201cAbham-nim. There is nothing I\u2019ve managed to accomplish with you yet. Aren\u2019t you curious? Don\u2019t you want to know how far I can go? Please go with me. A warrior dedicates their life to the person who recognizes their abilities. You were the person who recognized my worth yet I have not done anything for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHearing you say something like that, I am embarrassed at how weak I have become.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is still not too late. Even if it is just our oasis, we must prepare for battle. Since our oasis is the closest to Pareia, we need to prepare in advance and wait for the right moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe right moment \u2026 yes. We must wait. For me, and for you. Go, start getting them ready.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou will definitely be able to see the glory of victory.\u201d</p><br/><p>Runa\u2019s eyes started to shine.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

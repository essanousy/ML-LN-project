That thing can even crawl inside the sand. Whatever. Animals just need to be trained.\u2019</p><br/><p>Chun Myung Hoon thought about his dream as he ran forward until he reached the area with the quicksand.</p><br/><p>One of the biggest factors that divided the desert into East and West was this quicksand.</p><br/><p>In this vast desert, it was not possible to carelessly cross the quicksand that flowed like river water.</p><br/><p>With one wrong step, you could be swept completely in. It was so strong that if you fall in, you needed at least three pirmas pulling at the same time to barely make it out. Because of that, other than the weakly flowing areas or the couple paths where it did not flow, you could not cross it. That was why this quicksand was used as the border to divide the desert into East and West.</p><br/><p>The reason Chun Myung Hoon came to the quicksand was because of a dream he had last night.</p><br/><p>Chun Myung Hoon\u2019s dream.</p><br/><p>It was a dream where he was riding a Sand Dragon across the desert.</p><br/><p>After thinking about it for a long time, he seriously debated about whether it could actually be accomplished, and decided to come out here early in the morning to test it out.</p><br/><p>\u2018They said there are a lot of them in the Monster\u2019s Field and this large quicksand area.\u2019</p><br/><p>Chun Myung Hoon thought about the information he gathered from the old folks in the tribe and made his body light as he took one step into the quicksand. He had made up his mind to be the bait.</p><br/><p>The majority of Sand Dragons rest inside the quicksand and wait for something to fall into the quicksand. When monsters, animals, or a clueless young warrior or travelers and merchants from the continent fall into the quicksand, they appear like ghosts and eat them up.</p><br/><p>Pow. Pooooow.</p><br/><p>Chun Myung Hoon was walking on top of the quicksand while letting out his force around him. He was trying to use noise and vibrations to make a Sand Dragon quickly appear.</p><br/><p>After pounding away like that for a while and not having a Sand Dragon appear, Chun Myung Hoon changed locations and repeated his actions.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is it not showing up? Is it because it is still the strongest monster in the desert?\u2019</p><br/><p>After not seeing a Sand Dragon after moving around for an hour, he was both bored and annoyed as he put even more strength into his hand and made his force make even more noises.</p><br/><p>After around one hour of doing that, Chun Myung Hoon\u2019s eyes started to sparkle after feeling an odd vibration under his feet.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s here.\u2019</p><br/><p>Although he was on top of the flowing sand, Chun Myung Hoon\u2019s sensitivity was not comparable to a normal human, so he could tell what it was based on just the vibration and prepare for it.</p><br/><p>It happened in an instant.</p><br/><p>The moment he felt like something was coming up from underneath his feet, Chun Myung Hoon\u2019s body was pushed about 15 meters into the air. Under his feet was the red inside of a Sand Dragon\u2019s mouth following after him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI caught you, you little punk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chun Myung Hoon shouted loudly as he kicked the Sand Dragon\u2019s nose with his foot and raised his body even further.</p><br/><p>Kwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaang~!</p><br/><p>The Sand Dragon roared as it tried to put Chun Myung Hoon in its mouth, but there was only so much that the Sand Dragon could do since it could not fly.</p><br/><p>It shot up until approximately 30 meters before reaching its limit and lowering its head as it started to fall back down.</p><br/><p>Chun Myung Hoon used his Heavenly Demon Art to make his body really heavy, and then stepped on the falling Sand Dragon\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>Kwaaaaaaaaaaaaang~!</p><br/><p>Maybe it felt the impact on its head, but the Sand Dragon roared again, and after looking for somewhere to grab, Chun Myung Hoon tightly held onto the Sand Dragon\u2019s eyelids and took a deep breath.</p><br/><p>Uwooooooooo~!</p><br/><p>Papapapapat.</p><br/><p>The Sand Dragon roared in pain and started to go into the quicksand.</p><br/><p>The Sand Dragon was moving as fast as it could in the quicksand to throw this human off of its head.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hmm\u2026 so the inside of the quicksand looks like this. I guess since the density in here is low, it makes the sand flow? Is there perhaps a giant slope on the bottom that makes it flow?\u2019</p><br/><p>The Sand Dragon swam quickly inside the quicksand to throw Chun Myung Hoon off, but Chun Myung Hoon was covering his whole body with force and wasn\u2019t affected at all.</p><br/><p>It was just giving Chun Myung Hoon an interesting view.</p><br/><p>Seeing nothing new come up after riding it for a while, Chun Myung Hoon decided that he had seen enough and pulled hard on the Sand Dragon\u2019s eyelids.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Uoooooooooooooong~!</p><br/><p>The Sand Dragon, wanting to get rid of the pain in its eyes, turned its head in the direction Chun Myung Hoon was pulling to, and ended up heading back out of the quicksand.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are listening well. If you listen well like this, I will not kill you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chun Myung Hoon tapped the Sand Dragon\u2019s head telling it that it was doing well, but as the recipient, the Sand Dragon was about to go crazy. It finally realized that this monster-like human was not normal.</p><br/><p>All it could do was move its body in the direction that Chun Myung Hoon pulled toward.</p><br/><p>After riding on the Sand Dragon like he was flying for a while, Chun Myung Hoon came up with a crazy idea.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll like it if I gift this thing to that good girl Grace. Then she might put in even more effort to develop the things I want to eat. Not only that, I have not given anything to such a good girl.\u2019</p><br/><p>Although Grace had learned martial arts from Yulian and was more skilled than the average warrior, you never know what could happen. The greater Yulian got, the more that his family will be in danger of assassination. If that happens, wouldn\u2019t Grace be the easiest target for such an assassin?</p><br/><p>But if she rides this punk or this punk is around her, it would increase Grace\u2019s safety.</p><br/><p>\u201cEverything is good, except for this punk\u2019s violent nature.\u2019</p><br/><p>The problem was that only his disciple and he could take care of this Sand Dragon on their own in the tribe. But Chun Myung Hoon decided to take care of that with a simple solution.</p><br/><p>First, Chu Myung Hoon lifted his arm high in the air and strongly punched the Sand Dragon on the forehead.</p><br/><p>Pooooooooooow.</p><br/><p>Kwaaaak.</p><br/><p>There was an extremely loud noise as the Sand Dragon flailed around in pain.</p><br/><p>Chun Myung Hoon lightly lifted his body and landed on the ground before approaching the fallen Sand Dragon and starting to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom what I hear, a monster of your level has a decent amount of intelligence. No, it only makes sense that you do. Otherwise, I will just skin you and gift that to her. Since your body is pretty tough, it should make some great clothes. Kekeke.\u201d</p><br/><p>At Chun Myung Hoon\u2019s laughter, the Sand Dragon started to shake in fear. It tried to use the fact that Chun Myung Hoon was a bit away from him and tried to run.</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>Pow. Popopow. POOOOOOOW!</p><br/><p>Loud punching noises continuously filled the air as the Sand Dragon twisted its whole body in pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you try to run away one more time, I will definitely rip your skin right off. Get your ass here now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Whiiiiiiine~!</p><br/><p>Maybe it understood Chun Myung Hoon\u2019s words or it was its survival instinct, but the Sand Dragon made a whining noise as it crawled on the ground and headed toward Chun Myung Hoon.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have someone to gift you to. I will train you for a bit before that, so the way for you to live is to follow my orders properly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Roar.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will teach you a couple different commands, so pay attention.\u201d</p><br/><p>Roar.</p><br/><p>Chun Myung Hoon pointed to the front and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo!\u201d</p><br/><p>Roar?</p><br/><p>The moment the Sand Dragon stood there in confusion after not understanding Chun Myung Hoon\u2019s intent, there was another round of punching noises.</p><br/><p>Kwaaaaaaaaaaaak~!</p><br/><p>The Sand Dragon shouted in pain, and Chun Myung Hoon grabbed the Sand Dragon\u2019s eyelid as he pulled it forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt means go forward.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Sand Dragon ran with all its might in the direction Chun Myung Hoon was pulling it.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. Good job. This is the meaning of \u2018Go.\u2019 Do you understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Roar.</p><br/><p>The Sand Dragon peeked behind as it was running forward. If he was a decent distance away from this human, it was going to run with all of its strength.</p><br/><p>Kwaaaaaaaak.</p><br/><p>The moment the Sand Dragon turned its head, it was so surprised that it almost tripped over its own body. This damned human was running right next to him!</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. Now stop!\u201d</p><br/><p>Roar?</p><br/><p>Pow. Pow. Pooooooow.</p><br/><p>Paaaaaaaaak. Puaaaaaaaak.</p><br/><p>Chun Myung Hoon had slammed the Sand Dragon\u2019s neck. As it came to a stop, Chun Myung Hoon nodded his head as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the meaning of stop. Try to listen the first time. Stop making me use my hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>That day, the Sand Dragon was hit to the point it wanted to just die. But maybe there was a positive effect, since it could now understand many commands, such as, \u2018go,\u2019 \u2018come,\u2019 \u2018run,\u2019 \u2018stop,\u2019 \u2018to the left,\u2019 \u2018to the right,\u2019 \u2018a bit faster,\u2019 and \u2018slower.\u2019</p><br/><p>In addition, it even learned some really odd commands toward other monsters, such as \u2018eat it!\u2019 \u2018Rip it to shreds!\u2019 Turn it over on its back and sweep it away!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, this should be enough to keep Grace away from danger.\u2019</p><br/><p>Chun Myung Hoon felt that he was really talented in teaching, and happily got on top of the Sand Dragon\u2019s head and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>Roar?</p><br/><p>Poooooooooow.</p><br/><p>The Sand Dragon, which didn\u2019t know the difference between \u2018go\u2019 and \u2018let\u2019s go\u2019 had no choice but to be hit again.</p><br/><p>Become a patron and get advanced chapters!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

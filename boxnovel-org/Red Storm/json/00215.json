Is there a nation that does not know about the strength of the desert\u2019s shamshirs? Edwin, you can relax. \u00a0If something like that happens, we will compensate you for your losses and pay back the debt of that blood even if we have to go to war with that nation.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Edwin\u2019s jaws dropped once more at Yulian\u2019s stern words. These two people in front of him had really made up their minds. Even if it meant taking a risk, they were set on increasing Pareia\u2019s population. Of course with Pareia\u2019s current strength, it was something that was within their powers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even the Silence Empire had asked Pareia for a truce because they were afraid. WHo else would dare to step forward and attack Pareia? Right now, Pareia was the fastest growing and one of the strongest nations in the entire continent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cOkay.

We will definitely protect them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Runa responded in Yulian\u2019s stead and continued to speak.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cIf it is Edwin-nim\u2019s merchants, we have no issues with them moving under Pareia\u2019s flag.

It was because he knew very well about the meaning of a flag for Pareia. The different chiefs, the Glow, the Greatest Warriors, each of Pareia\u2019s flag meant authority within the tribe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">From the moment Edwin left toward the Eastern Continent with a large caravan once more, the rumor that Yulian and Runa hoped for started to spread like wildfire. The people who were homeless and the refugees who could not farm to feed themselves started to migrate to Pareia in large numbers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">How could anybody resist when it was said to be even better conditions than the Rojini Kingdom?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In fact, some of the people who were living under oppressive and terrible lords were also using the chaos from the war to throw away their homes and lands to participate in this migration. There were so many people that even Runa, who was confident that they would be able to accept any number of refugees, was starting to get a bit nervous.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">But thanks to that, Pareia\u2019s greatest issue of the male to female ratio finally started to get better little by little.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Pareia started to prepare for their transformation one step at a time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"></span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cAre all of the preparations completed?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cYes, Glow.

Relax and treat it like you are going on a vacation. Take good care of your wife while you are at it. Grace mentioned that your wife lives like a single mom.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Runa started to laugh as if he was embarrassed after hearing Yulian\u2019s words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cHahaha.

Do not worry about the tribe too much. There are a lot of things we need to do, but we have enough hands to get it done.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Rojini Kingdom that had just completed their victory over the Silence Empire started to treat Pareia as a reliable ally after the significant amount of assistance that Pareia provided for them during the war. That was why the Rojini Kingdom\u2019s king had invited important members of Pareia to visit them, and after thinking things over, Yulian decided to send the Red Storm and Runa.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was a way to give all of them a short break as they were busier than anyone else in the tribe, but Runa had other reasons for agreeing to go.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Rojini Kingdom, which has now pretty much become the strongest nation on the continent, had developed cultures, administrative offices, and methods of running a nation. By going on this visit, Runa would be able to see it all with his own eyes. Runa started to speak in a disappointed expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cI thought it would be great for all of us to visit together after we unify the desert.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cThere is nothing we can do about it right now.

I leave it to you to handle things in moderation. Do not attack them like you are attacking me.

Furthermore, Runa also suggested that this trip could benefit the Young Glow\u2019s future.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the end, since the Rojini Kingdom had Aizen and both Runa and all of the Red Storm warriors were going as well, Yulian finally managed to convince his two wives to have Verikan join the delegation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Since Yulian only had one son, this was showing a significant amount of respect to the Rojini Kingdom\u2019s king.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Verikan, who was now seven years old, was a bit nervous at the fact that he was leaving the desert for the first time. He held onto Runa\u2019s hand and asked about anything and everything he could see, and Runa did not seem to be annoyed even a little bit as he even thoroughly explained the things that Verikan did not specifically point out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cRuna ahjussi [1], is it true that once we get out of the desert there are lands that are green?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Although Verikan was the only son of the king and the Young Glow, warriors were existences that always needed to be respected in the desert.

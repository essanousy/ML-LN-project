Even without doing that, our Wikaly has not fallen to any sort of pressure for a long time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho said we should bow our heads? All I am saying is our tribe should make an alliance with another tribe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that exactly bowing our heads? If another tribe initiates an alliance request to us, the Glow has every mind to agree to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! You know that our Wikaly is the one who is urgently in need right now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWatch your mouth!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ebinong shouted loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho the hell is urgent? You seem to think that we have lost this war even before we have started to fight, so how can you claim you will win this battle!\u201d</p><br/><p>Runa Brink started to shout back in a stronger voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is not what I mean. Our Wikaly is in a delicate location. So we need to prepare first\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut your mouth. I have no desire to talk any further with a defeatist like you. Leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Runa Brink called out loudly to Ebinong at his words.</p><br/><p>\u201cCommanding Greatest Warrior Ebinong!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you to leave? I am fully capable of taking down Pareia on my own.\u201d</p><br/><p>At Ebinong\u2019s repeated request to leave, Runa Brink just stared at him without speaking.</p><br/><p>Ebinong did not even look at him, and Runa Brink said one last thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cI truly request that you do not move our main forces. If we just maintain our position, Pareia is bound to retreat on their own. It is a simple question if you think about how the Pareia have resisted against the Shuarei\u2019s Venersis.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c......\u201d</p><br/><p>Ebinong did not say anything else, and Runa Brink let out a long sigh before leaving Ebinong\u2019s paoe.</p><br/><p>Runa Brink climbed up the watchtower and looked toward the direction Pareia would be coming from.</p><br/><p>Tomorrow, or the day after that.</p><br/><p>They were about that far away according to the patrol warrior.</p><br/><p>Ebinong really should not move the warriors without thinking. That really was the best course of action.</p><br/><p>But there was something even Runa Brink did not know, and that was the fact that 10,000 warriors were headed toward the center of Wikaly through the quicksand river.</p><br/><p>As long as they don\u2019t know that, the truth was that the Wikaly will be eaten up by this red storm headed their way.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Pareia\u2019s troops were quickly moving toward the Wikaly oasis.</p><br/><p>But they were forced to stop once they arrived at about half a day\u2019s distance from it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are out here defending.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once Egane spoke after taking a look at the Wikaly warriors in front of them, Yulian nodded his head and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere seems to be around 20,000. Do you think we can take them on with our 14,000?\u201d</p><br/><p>Because Vibli and Trebol each took 3,000 warriors to loop around to the flanks, there were only 14,000 warriors in the center.</p><br/><p>Yulian was worried about the 6,000 extra warriors.</p><br/><p>Egane did not even have to think before he responded.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t we have the Glow and Red Storm? There is no reason we cannot take them on. Please remember why we had to defend against the Shuarei with greater numbers. There was only one reason. It was because we could not handle Venersis and the Desert Sword. It\u2019s actually better that the Wikaly came out like this to greet us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are thinking too highly of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Yulian answered with a somewhat serious expression, Egane smiled a bit before answering.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t know unless you have them as your enemy. You won\u2019t know just how much impact the existence of a single person that cannot be stopped can have if you have not gone up against them yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Since they have not experienced it yet, they have come out like this to greet us. Let\u2019s take them apart in an instant, Glow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian had studied a lot and learned a lot through training, but he was still nowhere near Egane when it came to strategies.</p><br/><p>Once Yulian nodded his head, Egane gave the command to move the warriors.</p><br/><p>\u201cGlow, let us use the method that Venersis enjoyed using.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><br/><p>Once Yulian asked, Egane was excited at giving back the same thing that they always suffered from and answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce the battle begins, please take the Red Storm and five hundred warriors and leave the formation. The moment we clash with the Wikaly, just pierce through the Wikaly\u2019s formation and run around causing havoc.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is all I need to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Yulian asked in confusion, Egane smiled as he answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cGlow still does not know what kind of existence you are. You do not know why a War God is called a War God. You did not awaken in our first battle against the Shuarei, but you awakened when you went against Venersis. My heart is pounding just thinking about seeing the effects of that awakening here today. Use the feeling you had when you went up against Venersis to control the WIkaly\u2019s formation. Then this battle will end up an overwhelming victory for Pareia.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian nodded his head. It was because he remembered that weird intuition he had that time against Venersis.</p><br/><p>\u2018Will I be able to sense the same thing this time?\u2019</p><br/><p>Yulian stepped forward as he started to think.</p><br/><p>\u2018If I could use that intuition whenever I wanted\u2026\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>He felt like he would never lose a battle or war if he could do that.</p><br/><p>Pareia\u2019s formation was set up in the T formation. It was one of the most aggressive formations, and it signaled Pareia\u2019s desire to clash once and pierce through. It also proved that they trusted in the training they put the warriors through.</p><br/><p>With Yulian in the lead, four Greatest Warriors followed behind him, and on the Wikaly\u2019s side, Ebinong moved forward, with four Greatest Warriors behind him.</p><br/><p>Once the two camp\u2019s Greatest Warriors faced each other, Yulian pushed forward wearing the red clothes that symbolized the Glow of Pareia.</p><br/><p>\u201cOowaaaaaa~!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian started to speak with Pareia\u2019s loud shouts behind him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, the Glow of Pareia, the Desert Conqueror Yulian Provoke says to you. The Wikaly\u2019s Glow disregarded my will to unite without making the warriors shed their blood for no reason. For how long must our desert walk on eggshells around the strong forces of the continent? It is still not too late. Join me. Join me and join Pareia as we enter the new stage of the desert.\u201d</p><br/><p>At Yulian\u2019s loud shout, Ebinong pushed forward, and this time, it was the Wikaly camp that shouted loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWaaaaaaaaaaaa~!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ebinong shouted loudly along with the shouts behind him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe name of the idiot in front of me is the Glow of Pareia. You are the one who is shedding the blood of your warriors for no reason. Today, under the orders of Gomai Mao, our great Glow of Wikaly, I, the Overwhelmingly Intelligent, Ebinong Albarooque, will set your mind straight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian snorted as he answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis sword of mine will tell us who made the wrong decision. Is there any warrior brave enough among the Wikaly\u2019s Greatest Warriors to fight me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ebinong laughed as if he was saying that was funny and answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really think too highly of yourself. Pride is not one of a warrior\u2019s virtues. Our Wikaly\u2019s warriors will teach that to you today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA warrior is not all talk. Show it to me with your actions.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ebinong glared at Yulian as he started to think.</p><br/><p>\u2018Whether it is the War God of the West or War God of the East, they are rated too highly. Honestly, it was only the Shuarei and Pareia fighting against each other. No other tribes have faced the so called strength of these War Gods. I\u2019m sure these are names they made up because they did not like to lose, so we do not need to pay much attention to it.\u2019</p><br/><p>Thinking that way, Ebinong took a look around at the Greatest Warriors who came with him. All of them were excent warriors of the Wikaly tribe.</p><br/><p>If Ebinong had ever seen Yulian in a battle, he would not have done something as stupid as having a battle of Greatest Warriors against Yulian.</p><br/><p>That is, if he had seen how Yulian managed to take an arm of one of the Shuarei\u2019s Greatest Warriors even when he was going up against two of them by himself.</p><br/><p>But Ebinong had not seen that and only considered Yulian to be a decently strong young warrior.</p><br/><p>Of course he had heard rumors about Yulian, but those are, as they are called, just rumors.</p><br/><p>The distance that he has walked with his two feet are probably more than that puny kid has traveled on top of a pirma, and he probably swung his sword more times than Yulian as well. It wasn\u2019t carelessness or overconfidence at all, but it was not right for a warrior to be afraid even before battling someone once.</p><br/><p>At that moment, one of Wikaly\u2019s Greatest Warriors, Shya, caught Ebinong\u2019s eyes and pushed forward. He was thinking the same thing as Ebinong.</p><br/><p>\u201cYaaaaaaaaaaaap~!\u201d</p><br/><p>With a loud grunt, Shya raised the speed of his pirma as he rode forward with the intent to slash Yulian into two with a single move, and Yulian just smiled as he slowly lifted up his greatsword.</p><br/><p>It reminded him of his first battle with the Shuarei. He remembered how they had achieved an overwhelming victory by his keeping three Greatest Warriors too occupied to lead the warriors!</p><br/><p>Remembering the memory of the battle, Yulian could have instantly killed Shya but decided not to do so.</p><br/><p>If Shya looks to be in danger, he was sure the other Greatest Warriors would come out to help him. In order to make that happen, he suppressed his strength and started to fight against Shya.</p><br/><p>The two of their weapons clashed many times in a short amount of time. Egane had a curious smile seeing what Yulian was doing. He had managed to read Yulian\u2019s thought process.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo not step forward even if the Glow seems to be in danger. The Glow has a plan of his own.\u201d</p><br/><p>Egane informed the other Greatest Warriors of Pareia. It would make things more complicated if some of them decided to try to help.</p><br/><p>As Yulian expected, once Shya looked to be in danger, another one of the Wikaly\u2019s Greatest Warriors rushed forward.</p><br/><p>But seeing how Yulian was not being pushed back while fighting against two of them and instead started to overwhelm both of them, Ebinong had to change his mind.</p><br/><p>\u2018The rumors about this punk were true. For him to not be pushed back even while fighting against two of our Greatest Warriors. But boy, you are trusting your strength too much. There\u2019s no way you can manage to do the same while fighting three of them.\u2019</p><br/><p>Ebinong motioned to one of the two remaining Greatest Warriors who then rushed forward. Now the only Greatest Warriors left for the Wikaly were Ebinong and Abham.</p><br/><p>Abham was amazed at Yulian who could handle three Greatest Warriors without any issues.</p><br/><p>\u2018Amazing. What an amazing warrior. They call him the War God of the East [1] \u2026 that rumor was not a lie.\u2019</p><br/><p>He also remembered Runa\u2019s warning.</p><br/><p>_____________________________________________________________-</p><br/><p>[1] The author goes back and forth referring to him as the War God of the East or West. In the beginning of Book 3, Edwin calls him the War God of the West. Now Abham calls him the War God of the East.</p><br/><p>Become a patron and get advanced chapters!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

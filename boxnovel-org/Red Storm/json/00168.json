Honestly speaking, if she had not showing him her strength, if she had not proved to him that her abilities could reduce the damage to Pareia by at least a little bit, Yulian would have opposed it until the end.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, Yulian had no choice but to approve of her abilities. That was why Violet was here right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Her extremely clear eyes started to shine. At that moment, her two arms headed up to the sky from the altar she had prepared in front of her. Her long white sleeves fluttered in the wind as she closed her eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal;

background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The moment she opened her mouth, both heaven and earth started to resonate with her before an aura surrounded her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The only thing that they could be certain about was the fact that some of the more sensitive warriors could not help but turn their heads toward Violet because of this oppressive force.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, Violet\u2019s song had not ended just yet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The moment Violet\u2019s two eyes opened widely, the extremely compressed power started to change into an overwhelming force.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The force became the wind as it swept through Pareia\u2019s warriors.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The spell wasn\u2019t completely literal, giving the warriors overwhelming strength like wild animals and really making the arrows miss them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, this wind made Pareia\u2019s warriors become like warriors. It made them push forward without fear, and raise their intuition during war so that they moved even a bit more effectively against their enemies.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They may be outnumbered 3 to 1, but Pareia\u2019s warriors were full of certainty about their victory.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They will defeat the enemy as they have done before, and they will take the Glory of Victory with them. That was the thought going through their minds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Pareia\u2019s warriors fiercely pierced through the enemies and pushed forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After releasing the strength that was gathered through the Warrior\u2019s Song, Violet plopped down on the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">She really was not the same as before. Even until last year, it did not take much effort to finishing the Warrior\u2019s Song. But now, it was so taxing that the sky seemed to turn yellow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was because part of her strength went to her newborn son, as well as the fact that she was not at her full strength, having come to war pretty much right after giving birth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Violet took a big breath before fixing her posture and rotating each arm before putting her two hands on her stomach and starting to recover her strength.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was not a battle that would end easily. That meant that singing a curse toward the enemy when both sides were tired would have extremely great effect. She needed to recover enough strength to sing that song.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The air around Violet started to compress once more.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">War...is something that drives people into a frenzy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the worst areas, there already was no distinguishing friend or foe. Since their murderous intent was only facing forward, there were many times that the people who pushed forward fell to their own side\u2019s shamshir by accident.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The only thing in their minds were to push forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If they were trained well and prepared well for war, there were more sights of such situations. However, the important part was that even though some allies might fall from friendly fire, there were a lot more enemies that fell down from those shamshirs.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Surprisingly, Pareia\u2019s 30,000 warriors were pushing back 50,000 warriors. Of course the impact of Yulian and the Red Storm that was creating paths and preventing the enemy formation from reforming played a significant role.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The golden flag with a picture of a bright sun fluttered everywhere he went. The flag that was first placed on Yulian\u2019s back to use him as bait had somehow become the symbol that represented where he was.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">How long must they have fought for?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Yulian could feel it. Now was the right time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The moment he waved the golden flag, Vibli quickly noticed the signal and sent a signal to the drummers and flag warriors to quickly start fixing up the formation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There were some warriors who could not hear because of the brutal battle, but thanks to their extremely focused training, they were soon able to quickly move as Vibli wished.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Pareia\u2019s warriors slowly started to move back as they fixed up their formation. Typically, such actions were difficult in a physical battle like this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, Yulian and Red Storm scurried here and there to overcome that difficulty. Thanks to them, the formation slowly but surely started to become fixed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There was no other reason they practiced this so much before the war. It was just for this movement.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Once the formation was fixed up, the situation flipped almost instantly. They went from being pushed back to pushing the enemy back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Nobody in the united tribe could even imagine in their dreams that Pareia\u2019s formation was starting to become fixed. Wasn\u2019t this a chaotic battle? It was the basic of basic that haphazardly fixing up a formation in a chaotic battle like this would put you on the wrong end of the battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In addition, there was an overwhelming difference in the number of warriors. Maybe that was the reason the Glows and Greatest Warriors of the united tribe were caught off guard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Suddenly, the tide of battle started to turn toward Pareia.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The surprised Greatest Warriors of the united tribe tried to guide the warriors, but randomly pushing against Pareia\u2019s already perfect formation was pretty much suicide.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cWe\u2026 should fix up our formation as well.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The united Glows who realized the situation started to shout loudly. They were extremely anxious now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The ones to become surprised after hearing the Glows\u2019 order were the Greatest Warriors.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201c......!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of them became pale as they looked toward the Glows, and one of the Greatest Warriors who came to his sense quickly started to rush his pirma toward the Glows and shouted at them to rescind the command, but the command had already fallen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As mentioned before, trying to fix up your formation in a chaotic battle would lead to your side being pushed back. It was because you had to show your back to the enemies, and because it took time to go find your spot in the formation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Pareia had practiced significantly for fixing up the formation in the middle of a chaotic battle, but that was not the case for the united tribe\u2019s warriors.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Some ran into each other, and the warriors who had worked with each other before were separating from the warriors they had not worked with before, until the situation became the worst possible situation for the united tribe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The warriors who were fighting in the heat of battle without differentiating friend or foe could not hear the order while the warriors who had not reached that point moved back according to the command. This created an opening that Pareia\u2019s warriors used to push through.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There really was no chance for them to do anything about it. It would have been best to give the command for the warriors in the back to retreat. Holes were created in many spaces with Pareia\u2019s warriors pushing through all of them. The completely broken formation had no hope of survival now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Vibli recognized what was going on and quickly changed the formation once more. An uncommon sight of surrounding a higher number of warriors with a lower number of warriors could be seen on the battlefield.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cGlow! You can still give the command to retreat\u2026\u2026!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Greatest Warriors of the united tribe looked toward their Glows and started to shout. Although the Glows of the united tribe may be great warriors, they did not have any war experiences. That was why they had made the worst decision out of nervousness.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The smart decision would be for an experienced Greatest Warrior to have the role of commanding officer. Yes, just like Vibli who was moving Pareia\u2019s formation right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Three Glows of the united tribe looked toward each other anxiously, before they heard another shout from a Greatest Warrior that sounded more like a screech. They then all nodded their heads and gave the order to retreat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A chaotic retreat would cause them a lot of damage as well, but it was better than becoming completely destroyed like this. They were just thankful that they had the numbers to lessen the impact of the damage from the retreat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Once the warriors of the united tribe completely turned their backs and started to run, Yulian gave the order to chase after them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At that moment, Vibli approached him and asked him to rescind the order to chase after them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cIt is our complete victory. However, thinking about the future, it is better to stop and fix up our formation and get some rest. If the warriors give all of their strength into this battle, the next battle will become difficult.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cBut aren\u2019t we missing out on a great opportunity?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cMaking the warriors not get too excited is also the job of a Greatest Warrior. In addition, this is the enemy\u2019s territory. We do not know what they may have prepared on their escape route.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Yulian thought for a moment before accepting Vibli\u2019s suggestion and calling off the chase.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The extremely frenzied warriors who were excitedly chasing after the warriors of the united tribe had to click their tongues and turn their pirmas around.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

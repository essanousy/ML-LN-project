I\u2019ve been so focused on the internal affairs lately.I have felt that the warriors have been a bit disappointed with it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is because hyung-nim is the symbol of Pareia\u2019s warriors.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian started to laugh as he responded.</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand. I have been feeling that we need to conduct a large scale training in the oasis, and tighten their minds that have gotten loose through this radical reform.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing what Yulian had to say, Pere decided he did not have to share his concern anymore.</p><br/><p>His brother already knew about everything.</p><br/><p>Pere swung both of his arms widely in the air as he changed the topic.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a great night tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes it is. By the way, is it going well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLearning under Greatest Warrior Egane.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pere lightly scratched the back of his head as he responded.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is very difficult. Normally, it is something you are slowly supposed to experience, but to learn it like this\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we can add a Greatest Warrior\u2019s leadership skills and discernment to the herculean strength you already possess, it would be like having another War God in Pareia. Do not be lazy with your studies.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHyung-nim, I am not a little kid. You are worrying about useless things.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Pere answered with a bitter smile, Yulian put his hand on Pere\u2019s shoulder as he started to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou seem to be young as well because of little Sense, hahaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSense Provoke was Pere\u2019s two year old son.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHyung-nim\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Pere had heard from his wife that Grace felt a huge burden from the fact that she still has not beared a child. He also knew that Yulian really liked children to the point that it was hard to take his son or Orca\u2019s daughter out of Yulian\u2019s arms.</p><br/><p>But maybe one of them has an issue, since his hyung-nim has been married for over five years and still has not has a kid. As a result, Pere had to be very cautious with the things he said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Knowing hyung-nim\u2019s personality, he will never take a new wife until hyungsoo-nim [1] has a child. And hyungsoo-nim will drag a single girl into hyung-nim\u2019s life even if she needs to force it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian was very stubborn and it was very difficult to change his mind about anything, and his hyungsoo-nim was also someone who accomplished anything she put her mind to achieve.</p><br/><p>Pere was worried that the two of them would end up getting into an argument because of it.</p><br/><p>Honestly, Yulian was being stubborn because he loved Grace and did not want to see her feeling hurt.</p><br/><p>Seeing Pere\u2019s expression turn grim, Yulian patted his shoulder as he started to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo not worry about it too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am not worried at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will head back now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pere bowed to Yulian before turning around and walking away, as Yulian just continued to watch Pere with a bitter heart until he could not see Pere anymore.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>\u201cCastle?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian looked at Runa with a shocked expression at the unexpected suggestion.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, a castle.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you talking about that thing in the continent?\u201d</p><br/><p>Runa answered Yulian\u2019s question.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. A CASTLE.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot a fortress but a castle? Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you planning on fighting against the Silence Empire?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c......\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian continued to gaze at Runa. It felt like Runa had looked right through his thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need to at least have the entire Eastern Desert under our control. Only then will we have enough strength to take on the Silence Empire.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Just how far has he thought about ?\u2019</p><br/><p>It should have been easy for Runa to figure out why Yulian had a grudge against the Silence Empire.</p><br/><p>But for him to have already been preparing to go against them; that was beyond Yulian\u2019s expectation.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe definitely need a castle. In order to take on the Silence Empire after unifying the Eastern Desert, there are too many disadvantages with the current oasis structure.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut we have so many places to use the materials right now. We do not have the luxury to create such a thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe construction will take a long time. We need to start the construction now so that the castle\u2019s foundation will be completed by the time we unify the Eastern Desert. Of course we will need to continue strengthening it after that, but we need to start now because the foundation is the most important part.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian thought about Runa\u2019s statement for a bit before asking a question.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you thinking about building a castle and then using that as the location to create what they call a capital in the continent?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Glow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut then wouldn\u2019t it be difficult to quickly react to a Shuarei invasion?\u201d</p><br/><p>Runa put his hand on his chest before speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will not move right away. Furthermore, the moment we unify the Eastern Desert, the balance of power in the desert will completely break. I am currently planning for ten years into the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHo! Amazing. I\u2019ve only had the vague thoughts about unifying the desert and fighting against the continent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know that the Glow has made some preparations as well. I\u2019ve just divided into different segments.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am curious about this plan of yours.\u201d</p><br/><p>Runa started to describe his ten year plan.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, the biggest hindrance to our unification of the Eastern Desert is, as the Glow expects, the Shuarei. However, the Shuarei should not be able to have more than 60,000 warriors by the time we have 100,000 warriors. Our population is already at least 1.5 times the Shuarei\u2019s population.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian had been thinking about that as well. Pareia\u2019s population had already passed 1,200,000 while the Shuarei\u2019s population was now around 700,000.</p><br/><p>Runa continued to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cTime is on our side. Three years from now, we will not need to worry about their provocation as long as the Glow and I are around.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRuna, do not look down on the Shuarei\u2019s Venersis too much. He is the only person in the desert that I am unable to defeat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard about Pareia\u2019s war against the Shuarei. It was because I had heard about that war that I was, at one point, able to effectively defend against the Glow. All you have to do is not face a monstrous warrior like that. Furthermore, now I have a Glow who can take him on, so even if we went against him, it would be our complete victory.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian, who started to smile at Runa\u2019s confidence, was laughing as he shook his head.</p><br/><p>But internally, he felt that this confident warrior was very trustworthy.</p><br/><p>He really felt like he could not lose a war as long as he was together with Runa.</p><br/><p>Runa opened one of his hands as he continued to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe quicksand river and 50,000 warriors. If you give me \u00a0the leadership over these 50,000 warriors, this Runa is confident that I will be able to successfully defend against even 100,000 warriors invading from the Western Desert. We have many talented Greatest Warriors, and it seems even Pere-nim is studying to be a Greatest Warrior as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPere was born with a divine power, so soon enough, I expect that other than some of the Red Storm members and myself, none of the other warriors in Pareia will be able to fight him one on one.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Yulian started to happily talk about his younger brother, Runa nodded his head and agreed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is true that he is an amazing person. While Pere-nim and I are defending Pareia, Yulian-nim can take the remaining warriors and move to unify the Eastern Desert.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was what I was thinking about as well. It is just a problem of time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are only three tribes left in the Eastern Desert, with similar numbers of oases. Maybe if the three of them joined forces they would pose a threat to us, but the tribes of the Eastern Desert have not had good relationships with each other for such a long time that it would be difficult for them to work together. As a result, I believe we will be able to defeat them in a short amount of time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Runa smiled again as he opened his hand once more.</p><br/><p>\u201cI believe we will need five years to accomplish all of that. I also predict that the war between the Rojini Kingdom and the Silence Empire will begin within these five years as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian asked with a shocked expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already considered that far?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if we unify the Eastern Desert, the truth is that we will not have the strength to fight against the Silence Empire. The Silence Empire is a strong empire with a population over 20,000,000 people. In addition, their number of troops is over 300,000. Wouldn\u2019t we need to accurately know about the situation of the continent in order to take them on?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian started to shudder.</p><br/><p>And seeing that the person who made him feel that way was saying all of this as if it was nothing made him shudder once more.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe only feeling I can have of you is awe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince I am the Glow\u2019s assistant warrior, I I just worked to make sure my thoughts were in line with yours. And that is why I have a suggestion for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian moved forward as he asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease create a relationship with the Rojini kingdom. The sooner the better.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can dispatch a diplomat or even send a messenger. All we had to do is show them that the desert tribe known as Pareia is able to annoy the Silence Empire. I presume the effects will be multiplied if you also tell them that we are able to provide them with black water they will need for war.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t all of our black water traded to Edwin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will increase our output. In addition, I\u2019m sure Edwin will be the happiest about this deal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is not like we can transport the black water. We will need to send it through Edwin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian tilted his head as he asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would Edwin like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is the perfect opportunity for a merchant guild to make connections with the royal family of a strong Kingdom. War has always been a once in a lifetime opportunity for merchants to benefit significantly. He will also have connections to both us and the Rojini kingdom, so the amount of classified information he will have access to will be very high. There is no way that merchant will not take advantage of this opportunity.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian looked toward Runa with a worried expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cWill he be able to handle it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is that person\u2019s issue and something for him to figure out. If he makes the wrong move and goes bankrupt, we can break the monopoly contract and make many merchant guilds compete against one another to give us the most profit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian started to frown a bit.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is someone who has helped us quite a bit. I do not want to just use him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGlow. War in itself is something people should not do. You must harden your resolve. Furthermore, the decision is in Edwin\u2019s hands so you have no reason to feel guilty.\u201d</p><br/><p>At Runa\u2019s stern words, Yulian started to smile bitterly.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor now, that is my plan for the next five years. I still need to think through the different scenarios for the five years after that, so I will report that once I have everything prepared.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, and Glow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Runa suddenly started to stumble upon his words and could not make eye contact with Yulian as he started to answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026 you see\u2026 well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were talking so well, what is going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm...that\u2026 could you please tell Grace-nim that...I liked the girl...whose hair comes down to her shoulder\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c......\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them stared at each other for a long time.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahahat, I understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGlow\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha, I\u2019m sorry for laughing. But I just can\u2019t help \u2026 hahaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Runa\u2019s face started to turn bright red.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>The sixth month in the year 256 of the continental calendar. Many people of the continent were currently moving around in Pareia.</p><br/><p>There were a lot of people who were gathering black water, and the construction of the Castle of Storm had started in the Eastern Oasis.</p><br/><p>Hold on! As this chapter comes to an end.</p><br/><p>I hope that all of my novels are connected to each other.</p><br/><p>In the next chapter, we will be introduced to two figures who are my next project\u2019s main character and heroine. We will also head to the Magic Tower, which will be the largest arc for this novel.</p><br/><p>I am just telling you in advance in case you start to wonder if this novel is completely changing to focus on martial arts from here on. ^^;;</p><br/><p>From here on, you can pretend that any extra characters with importance (Chun Myung Hoon and Edwin are kind of the representatives of that group ^^;;) are figures from other projects.</p><br/><p>I plan to share with you the stories that I had thought about from the moment I started to write my first novel 3 years ago, one by one.</p><br/><p>The feel of the story might not seem to align with each other (based on the character), but I am cautiously thinking about whether you will develop interest and enjoy the figures that the Red Storm characters come across for the rest of the series. But I am letting you know now that there will be no overlapping in the stories themselves.</p><br/><p>I will briefly bring this up again with the introduction of the Magic Tower.</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 8.</p><br/><p>Next up:</p><br/><p><strong>A New World</strong></p><br/><p><i>The place he returned to.</i></p><br/><p><i>A new world and meeting new people.</i></p><br/><p>_____________________________________</p><br/><p>[1] Korean term for sister-in-law</p><br/><p>Become a patron and get advanced chapters!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

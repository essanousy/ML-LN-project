He was confident that even that Venersis would not be his match anymore.</p><br/><p>Earlier one, he had to hide his strength for the sake of their strategy, but right now, he just needed to kill the enemy as soon as possible. That was the only way to save the thirty members of Red Storm and his wife Violet, who were most likely shedding a lot of blood to take the gate right now. He needed to get there to save them and take the gate.</p><br/><p>\u201cOowoooooo~!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian shouted out loudly and started to swing his greatsword toward Spotch. It wasn\u2019t as accurate because his mind was in a rush, but instead, his strength was amplified even further.</p><br/><p>Clang.</p><br/><p>A loud noise of metal clashing could be heard before Spotch flinched. This was not the same opponent he faced a couple hours ago. His strength seemed to be multiple times stronger than before.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were hiding your strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>Spotch shouted sharply and tried to strategize, but Yulian\u2019s other greatsword was already aiming for Spotch\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>Claaaaaaaaa~aaang. Clang Clang.</p><br/><p>The sound of metal clashing could be heard over and over as Spotch fervently blocked Yulian\u2019s greatswords, and Yulian was getting angry that he could not defeat Spotch quickly and continued to use even more strength to attack.</p><br/><p>As Spotch was continuing to get pushed back and tried to catch himself from falling down, Yulian\u2019s pirma, which was angry from running into the enemy horse over and over, lifted up its large body and flung its front two legs. Those front legs landed on the calf of Spotch\u2019s horse.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Spotch let out a moan from the strong shock he felt from falling off the horse, and the moment he came back to his senses, he saw something flashing in front of his eyes.</p><br/><p>Plop.</p><br/><p>Spotch\u2019s body-less head flew up into the sky and let out a blood fountain before falling back down.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, warrior of the continent. I do not have any time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian showed quick respect to Spotch\u2019s head that was rolling on the floor before taking a deep breath, gathering his ki, and shouting out.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have cut the neck of your commander. There is no reason to fight any further. All knights and soldiers of the continent, drop your weapons!\u201d</p><br/><p>The battle of Henkel Plains was coming to a close.</p><br/><p>The battle that was happening at the entrance of Henkel Gate was definitely a Land of Death.</p><br/><p>There was so much blood on the ground that it became an obstacle every time they moved, and there was almost no open land as the entire area was covered densely in corpses.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuuuuuuuff~ Huuu~huuuuuuff.\u201d</p><br/><p>All of the Red Storm warriors were extremely short of breath. Other than that past battle where they lost their friends, there had been no other battle where they ended up so winded like this battle.</p><br/><p>Was everybody thinking about that battle? They were almost subconsciously swinging their blades, thinking that one of their friends may die if they stopped moving.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhhh~\u201d</p><br/><p>The infantry soldiers in front of them were so afraid that they were getting killed even by such swings.</p><br/><p>They wanted to run away from this terror, but three or four soldiers who tried to retreat were instantly killed by Henkel Gate\u2019s commander Viscount Stearthur and the archers waiting for his command. Death in the front and death in the back, they had no place to go.</p><br/><p>\u201cCharge. Those barbarians are only lasting this long because all of you are so scared.\u201d</p><br/><p>Viscount Stearthur continued to shout and tried to push the soldiers forward, but it was no use. Instead, you could see what the soldiers who were looking at him wanted to say.</p><br/><p>\u2018Then you try going there.\u2019</p><br/><p>Viscount Stearthur was not a noble who grew up peacefully in a fancy house, and he was no coward. That was why he was able to land an important position for a soldier as the commander of Henkel Gate.</p><br/><p>But Viscount Stearthur could not step forward right now. He was the only high ranking officer left at the gate. If he died, the soldiers were sure to get scared and run away.</p><br/><p>Close to 7,000 soldiers would run away because of barely thirty barbarians and a woman.</p><br/><p>Viscount Stearthur continued to shout as he urged the soldiers forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave courage! If they take the gate, they will kill all of your families!\u201d</p><br/><p>That finally brought the soldiers back to their senses. Although they did not have enough to live a luxurious life, there were quite a lot of soldiers who were able to start a family with the salary they received from the gate.</p><br/><p>If the barbarians got past Henkel Gate, there was nothing preventing them from getting all the way across the rest of the plains. And at the end of the plains was their homeland, the Mobile region.</p><br/><p>None of the people there would expect that Henkel Gate could be breached, so there would be a lot of damage if the enemies ambushed the area. Based on the rumors, these barbarians of the desert killed as they pleased while kidnapping the women.</p><br/><p>\u201cDie~ you damn barbarians!\u201d</p><br/><p>The soldiers were still scared, but they were just instinctively swinging their blades now. At least their spears and swords started to carry some murderous intent.</p><br/><p>The Red Storm warriors had already killed close to 2,000 enemy soldiers. As the enemy started to charge toward them with murderous intent, the injuries on their bodies started to grow one by one.</p><br/><p>Violet, who had been singing a song of courage and defending the warriors from the enemy magic brigade\u2019s attacks while standing directly under the castle gate, the safest area of the battlefield, quickly started to sing a new song.</p><br/><p>She started to sing a Warrior\u2019s song to help tired warriors feel strong once again.</p><br/><p>Stand up, warrior.</p><br/><p>Stand up and move forward.</p><br/><p>The enemy blades miss my body,</p><br/><p>And my blades will pierce the enemy.</p><br/><p>Forget your fear and move forward.</p><br/><p>Warrior, do you lack the strength to stand?</p><br/><p>Do not lose to your body.</p><br/><p>Your fiery passion,</p><br/><p>And your storm-like courage</p><br/><p>Sits deep inside of you.</p><br/><p>Why are you trying to lose?</p><br/><p>Stand up, warrior.</p><br/><p>Stand up and move forward.</p><br/><p>If a song of courage was used to raise the strength of the warriors, the Warrior\u2019s song was a song to restore their tired stamina.</p><br/><p>The Red Storm warriors who had originally felt like they had used everything they had inside of them, could feel their strength returning to them. But even that did not last long.</p><br/><p>It is said that the Warrior\u2019s song helps recover a warrior\u2019s stamina, but in reality, it just helped to draw out the warrior\u2019s remaining potential. But for the Red Storm warriors who had already possessed multiple times the strength of an average warrior after going through arduous amounts of training, their stamina quickly started to visibly deteriorate.</p><br/><p>Violet took out a sosoonto from her clothes after seeing that.</p><br/><p>It was time to use her strength that she had been saving until now. The Warrior\u2019s song was not enough to get them out of this situation.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t know how much longer they would be able to last with her strength, but she knew that Yulian and his warriors needed to quickly defeat Marquis Spotch and hurry over.</p><br/><p>Violet closed her eyes to calm herself and confirm her resolve.</p><br/><p>If she had the time and luxury, she would have brought some incantation tools to help her quickly perform incantations, but the situation did not allow for that. That was why she could only rely on her own strength to make it happen. She knew the dangers before coming out here, but it would be a lie to say she was still not scared.</p><br/><p>But she needed to do it.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

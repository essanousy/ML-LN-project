The existence felt like he was so shabby and felt like he could burn away from embarrassment, as he looked up at the empty air and started to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, did you really have to do that?\u201d</p><br/><p>The tone of the voice was very calm and relaxed, but there was a lot of unexplainable emotions mixed into it.</p><br/><p>The existence continued to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you really like them? Didn\u2019t you really love them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy son, I still love them.\u201d</p><br/><p>The existence started to speak louder.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why did you have to do that? Weren\u2019t they the creation you created with your two hands and breath?\u201d</p><br/><p>The father answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy son, I do love them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you destroy them because you love them? Is that why you put them through so much pain?\u201d</p><br/><p>The light started to shake as the existence started to raise the tone of his voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am their father and their creator.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once he heard a response, the existence bowed his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cTheir sins had filled the world, and their every thought was evil that I regretted creating them in the first place.\u201d</p><br/><p>This existence named Lucifer, who was at one point, one of the most radiating of all Archangels but now had revolted against God and left, started to shout.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, why did you not forgive them? Didn\u2019t you forgive them in the past and won\u2019t you forgive them in the future either?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI regret that I destroyed all of them with my water. I regret not loving even their wrongdoings. I will never destroy them with water ever again. And I promise change for the single pair of life that is now left in the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lucifer looked down at the world. Since the speed of time between the world and the location where Lucifer was currently at moved at a different pace, the world was already quickly starting to change.</p><br/><p>Lucifer let out a loud sigh as he started to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t it you who taught me to love? Wasn\u2019t it you who taught me to love and love again? The wails of the people you have ordered to be destroyed continue to pierce this son\u2019s heart. The emotions you gave them to think and feel on their own continues to bother me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tears started to form in Lucifer\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, your son who does not know this thing called oblivion that you have given them is tormented without rest. That is the only thought that has been in my head ever since I have learned of your plan. That was why I put my faith in your love and forgiveness to go against you, father. I took up arms against you because I was afraid of your anger that may endlessly continue.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lucifer already knew of his father\u2019s plan. That was why he went against his father and gathered many angels to revolt with him. However, Lucifer was blocked by the Archangel Michael and ended up falling down to earth.</p><br/><p>He tried to get the people of the world to ask for his father\u2019s forgiveness and make amends for their sins. However, his father\u2019s anger was too scary, and Lucifer wanted to defend the world against that anger regardless of what it took.</p><br/><p>Even with all of Lucifer\u2019s efforts, the beings of the world that his father had created did not reflect on their actions.</p><br/><p>That was why his father had ordered to destroy them with water. The order was carried out and the world was completely submerged under water after around forty days of continuous downpour.</p><br/><p>Lucifer was very pained because of this.</p><br/><p>Because of the abilities given to him by his father, he had already known about his father\u2019s will and was prepared for this pain, but he was not able to adjust and it tortured him.</p><br/><p>If he had not revolted against his father and fallen down to the earth, the order to destroy everyone would have been given to him with certainty.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lucifer continued to feel the pain that could not be relieved and continued to wail out in tears.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am fearful about when the world will go against your will again in the future. I am fearful that they will call forth your wrath again in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lucifer\u2019s whole body started to shake.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe seal where your other wrath is sealed, I am fearful that they will forget about it. I feel that they will question your omnipotent existence. The day that they release the seal that has your wrath sealed within it, I fear about the loudness of their painful wails. I am extremely fearful of that day.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lucifer stopped talking at this point and just blankly stared out.</p><br/><p>The area surrounding Lucifer was filled with darkness.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy father is the light and your son, \u00a0the one who goes against your will is the darkness. I believe in your love father, and I believe in your grand presence, father. That is why this son will revolt against you once more. The seal of your wrath, this son will seal once more. This son may end up an eternal sinner that may never be forgiven for not following your will, but your son will trust in his father\u2019s love and do what he believes to be right.\u201d</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>\u201cThe seal that is stated in the Holy Scripture to prevent the end of the world. The seal of destruction.\u201d</p><br/><p>What the old woman was saying was definitely surprising. However, Yulian was not surprised at all; he was merely curious.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, is that the truth?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince they say that Lucifer himself had said so, there is a high chance that it is the truth. Neither devils nor angels ever lie. They just find ways to hide the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, if it is as you say, then they did not do anything wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is because of the difference of opinion about that aspect that led to the continuous conflict between the Magic Tower and the Chaos Island. Each side believes that their belief is the right one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to turn this conversation in a different direction, but I am not sure why I need to listen to this story.\u201d</p><br/><p>At Yulian\u2019s question, the old woman had a \u2018What a shocking question?!\u2019 type of expression on her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you earlier? You are a chosen one who was born with the Mandate of Heaven.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy am I a chosen one?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow would I know the workings of Heaven?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Yulian made a noise, the old woman cautioned him as she continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cListen closely. There are twelve chosen ones in the world and thousands of people who know and are aware. Six of the twelve chosen ones are destined to meet the Magic Tower first, while the other six are destined to meet the Chaos Island first. Isn\u2019t that amazing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, I already have a lot of things to do. I really don\u2019t understand why I need to hear such a story. I have my own dream and I do not want to get myself involved in anything else.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is not getting involved but just the flow of destiny. Furthermore, how many people would choose not to care about the rift that can bring for the end of the world?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian shook his head at the old woman\u2019s words. How preposterous was all of this?!</p><br/><p>As Yulian thought about it, he remembered Mai saying something very similar. Did he say the recreation of the world?</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, then please continue.\u201d</p><br/><p>At Yulian\u2019s response, the old woman lifted up her hand to draw a weird drawing in the air.</p><br/><p>Once she did that, a dim light started to shine in the path the old woman\u2019s hand moved.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe origin of the rift was from the creation of the seal on Chaos Island to seal the final judgement of heaven. The people of Chaos Island want to use human strength to make the world go around, and to prevent the end of the world. However.\u201d</p><br/><p>The old woman opened her hand and erased the drawing of light before starting to draw again.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is an absolute rule in the world about causality. Everything that happens in the world, and the results of those actions have a cause and reason for it. Our Magic Tower believes in that philosophy.\u201d</p><br/><p>The old woman\u2019s hand started to draw a red image which started to intertwine with the original image. It wasn\u2019t randomly moving, but actually creating exquisite figures..</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Chaos Island goes against that absolute rule. Their action alone will make the world more chaotic, but they believe that is the right way. They believe that this world needs to move based on the will of the people in the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is complicated.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. When humans try to use their head to go against the rules of the heaven, it will always be complicated. But they do not believe that their actions will create the rift that will push forward the recreation. In fact, they believe that they are slowing it down by sealing it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian thought of Mai and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what is Mai-nim doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMai is reversing the seal of Chaos Island to nullify the effects of the seal of Chaos Island.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian finally understood why Mai had spent years down underground without ever being able to see the sunlight.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen Mai-nim must be one of the chosen ones as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven that kid with him, Luff, is a chosen one. And the two of them have chosen to stand on the side of our Magic Tower.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWill I need to make a decision as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Become a patron and get advanced chapters!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

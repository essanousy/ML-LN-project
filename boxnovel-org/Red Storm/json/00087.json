Having two older brothers above him, this young man threw away any thoughts of succeeding the Viscount title a long time ago.</p><br/><p>He discovered his skills in business at an early age and joined the Serubil Merchant Guild, one of the sturdiest merchant guilds in the Inama Kingdom.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t look good for the son of a noble to work in a merchant guild, and Viscount Papent even tried to stop his youngest son\u2019s actions, but Edwin was not used to the life of a noble. Rather than becoming a leech to the family in the future, he firmly decided that he would find his own path and explained this to his brothers and the Viscount with sincerity. Sadly, all it did was make them shake their heads.</p><br/><p>The owner of the Serubil Merchant Guild, Von Serubil, cherished this odd son of a noble very much.</p><br/><p>Edwin had a natural talent for business that others did not have. Any businesses he invested in absolutely succeeded, and he kept any promises he made. Thanks to that, the credibility of the Serubil Merchant Guild went up as well.</p><br/><p>Since he really was what you would call a golden egg laying young merchant, there was no reason not to like him. That was why Serubil had given him quite a bit of authority in the guild.</p><br/><p>However, even Serubil had one issue with Edwin. It was the fact that Edwin had no restrictions when it came to forming friendships.</p><br/><p>This habit, in some aspects, was really good, but it was to the point that Edwin was making friends with criminals wanted by the kingdom. That made things complicated.</p><br/><p>If something happens and he gets wrongfully accused -- although it is true -- of hiding fugitives, not only the Serubil Merchant Guild, but even the reputation and connections Edwin has made would all crumble in an instant.</p><br/><p>Serubil said something to Edwin, as it looked like he was heading out to meet with that criminal brigade again.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it time to stop?\u201d</p><br/><p>Edwin perked his ear and responded back.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat food supply.\u201d</p><br/><p>At Serubil\u2019s answer, Edwin looked toward him with an extremely amazed expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you not want to make money?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho said I don\u2019t want to make money?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why is it that you are complaining when I am trading rare and extremely expensive high quality Monster\u2019s Souls for cheap as dirt food and clothing? Do you know how much money I make every time I make a trip down?\u201d</p><br/><p>You could clearly tell they were merchants as they were talking business even while raising their tones.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut isn\u2019t it dangerous? If the nobles that put bounties on their heads find out, they will not sit still.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, should I tell everyone that their punk of a son raped the precious younger sister of another family and made the older brother beat him to death? Should I tell the world the truth about why the bounty was placed? Or how about the scrooge who has a storage full of money that kidnapped someone\u2019s daughter because they were short a few coins when paying their taxes forcing the girl\u2019s family to burn his house to the ground and run away with his daughter? Should I let the world know about that as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>At Edwin\u2019s words, Serubil tapped his head once before answering.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t do anything about those kinds of things.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy father and brothers are not like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is why your family is respected. It was also the reason I took you in like this. Plus, it is not just our kingdom that is like this. Other than the Rojini Kingdom in the East, the majority of kingdoms live like this. Sigh, the nobles are the problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is the reason we cannot become like the Rojini Kingdom? Look at them. Haven\u2019t they become stronger once the royal family put out a law mandating that the tax rate cannot be greater than twenty percent? The nobles there can apparently rake in money while just sitting on their asses. Since the civilians pay low amounts in taxes, it has led to them working as hard as they can to make more money. But our Inama Kingdom digs out over fifty percent of the people\u2019s money in taxes, so how can they ever take a break? If we continue like this, there will be big trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>Serubil was extremely shocked as he held onto Edwin\u2019s shoulders and started to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cShh. Be quiet. What will you do if someone hears you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLeader, you should work hard to make a lot of money. We can run away from this dirty kingdom together. As soon as I hit my target goal, I will convince my entire family to leave to a different kingdom.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour father, Viscount Papent. Like hell he would go with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFather is not like how he used to be. His upright character is making a lot of the other nobles hate him. Those damn bastards get scared by a single Viscount.\u201d</p><br/><p>Serubil shook his head at Edwin\u2019s temper and started to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake good care. Always be careful. If what you are doing is discovered, there will be big issues for your family as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo not worry so much. This isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve done this. Just make sure you sweet talk the magicians so that we can get a good price for the Monster\u2019s Souls.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once Serubil left, Edwin took another look at the supply items he had and verified whether he had missed anything. Once he verified everything was good, he ordered the cart to head out.</p><br/><p>The passage to the Red Desert was extremely dangerous. Since there were not many cities on the northern end of the desert, there were not many roads and the terrain was dangerous as well. Just pulling the supply cart through was troublesome.</p><br/><p>But since it was a trip Edwin made two times a year, Edwin\u2019s crew had to push forward without falling off pace. They could not miss the scheduled meeting time.</p><br/><p>At the border of the Inama Kingdom, or in other words, at the entrance to the Red Desert, there was always a shabby looking border patrol officer.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you been well, Officer Samaru?\u201d</p><br/><p>Edwin waved his hand toward Nate Samaru, the leader of the 13th Southern Border Defense Force, as he greeted the man.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is you. I expected you would show up around now. It\u2019s nice to see you again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m sure you are not happy to see me but actually happy to see the bribes I give you.\u2019</p><br/><p>That was what Edwin was thinking inside, but he had a bright smile on the outside, one of the special abilities of all good merchants.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am also extremely happy to see Officer Samaru always welcoming me like this. Has everything been going okay lately?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know how it is. Although we are called border patrol, there are no barbarians who would dare to invade from the desert, and there are no kingdoms that would cross the dangerous desert to invade us through here. So I have nothing to do. And sadly my pay is terrible since my job is like this as well. Huhuhu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018He\u2019s being real forward about asking me for it.\u2019</p><br/><p>Edwin frowned internally while taking out a leather pouch from his chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry that I cannot do much for you even though you welcome me like this every time. Please use this to treat your subordinates to a round of beer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is hard to always be in your debt like this. It is not like we are doing much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nate Samaru quickly grabbed the pouch from Edwin\u2019s hand as he said that. Edwin was smiling bitterly inside.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, at least it is easy to deal with you since you don\u2019t beat around the bush. I guess you are better than the other border patrols.\u2019</p><br/><p>He was someone that Edwin will continue to deal with, and since Samaru was good about accepting difficult requests from time to time, Edwin just hoped that Samaru would never leave this post.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs I said, it is just enough to treat them to a round of beer.\u201d</p><br/><p>At Edwin\u2019s words, Samaru took a peek into the pouch and had a satisfied smile on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you as usual. Is it the same items again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. It is always the same. It is not like I can cross the desert with expensive goods. Hahahaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I will trust you and not inspect it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have nothing to worry about, Officer Samaru.\u201d</p><br/><p>Samaru waved his hand toward the patrol members blocking the path of the merchants.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, let them through. Why are you blocking their path like that when we all know each other?\u201d</p><br/><p>The patrol members had also seen everything and smiled as they cleared the path. Edwin said goodbye to Samaru one more time as he started to move.</p><br/><p>\u201cOfficer Samaru, I shall see you when I return.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Be careful out there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Edwin\u2019s crew passed the border area like that and entered the desert.</p><br/><p>The crew had to be more alert after entering the desert. This place was different than the continent. This was a place where many monsters and wild animals resided, so they were forced to always be on alert.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone is coming this way.\u201d</p><br/><p>The lead mercenary protecting the cart shouted loudly and Edwin had an extremely nervous expression on his face.</p><br/><p>They had never run into anybody on their trip out to the desert before.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it a person of the desert? They said that not many desert folks come this way because of the many quicksands in the area.\u201d</p><br/><p>Edwin mumbled to himself as he asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow many people does it seem to be?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAround 50 people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe desert tribes do not accept bands of thieves. I\u2019m sure they are not thieves and are one of the desert tribes, so please tell your people not to carelessly take out their weapons.\u201d</p><br/><p>At Edwin\u2019s words, the lead mercenary moved his hand from the hilt of his sword and answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I will caution them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Edwin stopped his crew and waited for the people to approach them.</p><br/><p>Since they were not far from their destination, if needed, they could always ditch their stuff and ride the horses to run away to that location.</p><br/><p>\u201cEdwin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCaptain Thriger?\u201d</p><br/><p>He heard a familiar voice from the front of the approaching group, and Edwin had a happy expression as he ran forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cEdwin. You are exactly on time as always. I didn\u2019t know how it would be, so I had been waiting since yesterday.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Thriger welcomed Edwin and he held his hand, Edwin thought it was odd and decided to ask.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut what is going on? This is the first time you came to greet me like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThings ended up that way. There is someone I\u2019d like to introduce you to as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIntroduce?\u201d</p><br/><p>Thriger nodded his head as he continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can guarantee that it will be great news for you. Although the decision to invest will be up to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feeling that the smell of money was coming out of Thriger\u2019s words, Edwin started to smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Captain-nim talks so highly of a person, I\u2019m sure they must be amazing. After all, you were once an Admiral that dominated the oceans.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thriger loudly laughed at Edwin\u2019s words and started to respond.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha. It is all in the past. We do not need to go to our base. We docked the ship not too far away, so let us head there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you move your base?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRather than moving, we have found a permanent location. I have found someone to serve.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone that captain-nim is serving?\u201d</p><br/><p>Edwin was extremely shocked as he asked. What kind of individual was Thriger? Thriger used to be an Admiral for the Inama Kingdom, one of the strong kingdoms of the Eastern Continent.</p><br/><p>Thriger was so upright that many nobles plotted against him and forced him to run away to the desert, and had even once told Edwin while he was drunk that he would never serve anyone ever again. For someone like that to make the decision to serve someone, it was absolutely certain that it was an amazing person.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt ended up that way. I can tell you more as we head back. The Glow has been waiting a long time to meet you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen you say Glow\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Edwin was even more shocked as he had a decent knowledge of the titles in the desert.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet us go. I will tell you as we head over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Edwin motioned the crew to move as he started to wonder about the person he was about to meet.</p><br/><p>Become a patron and get advanced chapters!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

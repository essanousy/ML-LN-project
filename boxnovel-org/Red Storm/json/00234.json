The moment it looked like there was so much ki in the swords that even normal people would be able to see it, Yulian twisted his swords and pushed them further into the reaper\u2019s waist.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The reaper\u2019s black light disappeared after Yulian\u2019s attack and chunks of darkness started to spurt out of the reaper\u2019s entire body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Once Yulian and Aizen quickly retreated, the reaper started to blow up like a person who was spurting blood.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Did about three seconds pass?

His greatswords were glowing black and red. Yulian did not dare to touch it because he did not know what might be on it, and looked toward Aizen and the Red Storm as he started to speak.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cThis is not good.

The warriors and foreigners brigade immediately took care of any summoned monsters, and continued to gain experience dealing with monsters in the process. People started to relax after thinking the Monster\u2019s Desert was completely subjugated, and some of the adventurers and mercenaries started to withdraw, thinking that there was no longer any reason to stay. This was when the situation happened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A large number of monsters being summoned at once. Although they had blockades set up at every magic circle, other than the locations that Yulian and Aizen were defending, the teams were unable to handle the large number of monsters. This led to the blockades being run over by the monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Some areas with the Silence Empire\u2019s knights or strong adventurer groups managed to hold on, but they needed to watch their backs because other areas were no longer safe. Thanks to that, they were unable to put their full strength to subjugate the monsters in front of them and ended up being broken through as well.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">That day, the Red Storm and Red Knights had to continuously move around. They did manage to take care of all of the monsters after gathering the warriors and the foreigners brigade in the rear, but hundreds of people were laid to rest in the desert that day.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The number of soldiers increased once more because of that incident, and the warriors and foreigners brigade could not help but be stuck in this Monster\u2019s Desert even if no monsters were spawning.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With the warriors and foreigners brigade complaining because there was nothing to do in the area and no monsters were spawning, each nation\u2019s representatives started to worry. This was also the case for Yulian, who had the highest number of warriors designated to the area.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They would not be thinking about it if they were continuously fighting, but it really was too boring right now.

The spiritual strength of our ancestors were extremely strong. That was the reason it was able to last this long, but we cannot guarantee safety even if we drew some magic circles. It might get washed away with a single rain.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Runa also shook his head and answered back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cI am not suggesting that we draw magic circles.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Yulian\u2019s eyes started to sparkle as he looked toward Runa.

That is it. We will build a castle here with a single entrance. We will use the fact that the monsters rely on their natural instincts to have the shamans install different things that monsters will not like. That way, it will lead them to the single entrance point.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cThen there will be no issues as long as we can properly seal off that single entrance.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Seeing Yulian say the rest of the plan with a smile, Runa also replied back with a smile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cThen there will be no reason for so many people to be stuck guarding this location.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cThat is a good idea.

It seemed to be something that would make them lose face if others heard what they had to say.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"></span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Merchants are scary. People who do everything they can to earn money are also scary. It was funny to see that a marketplace was starting to take shape near the Monster\u2019s Desert. There were large numbers of warriors and soldiers, knights who were willing to spend a lot of money, as well as a large number of citizens.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The construction of the castle in the Monster\u2019s Desert had started. Of course there was not a single cent that Pareia paid for the construction of this castle. In fact, they even received a stipend for 50,000 warriors.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Runa was very confident about that issue. He was just as confident when he brought up the discussion of building a castle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">- To be honest with you, it possesses no threat for our Pareia to not seal off that area. The only reason we are doing this is for our alliance nations, as well as all of your citizens who will shed their innocent blood if we do not do something about it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Runa clenched his fists and continued to speak.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">- That is why we have decided to build a large cage in order to prevent any potential ambush by the monsters. It is not for our Pareia but for all of your nations.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">People started to whisper amongst each other and Runa quickly passed the pile of paper in front of him around to everyone as he continued to speak.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">- This is the blueprint for the castle that we plan to build in the Monster\u2019s Desert. We will need a lot of workers, steel, stone, and magicians. We are not forcing any of you to contribute. However, I\u2019m sure all of you are aware that the weaker the castle is, the easier it will be for the monsters to run wild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It really may have been more of a threat than Runa being confident. However, there was nobody who was upset about it in the room. They knew what Runa was saying was true, as well as the fact that Pareia had sent the largest number of warriors to the Monster\u2019s Desert. Furthermore, the most dangerous role was still on Pareia, so even though the materials for construction might be too much for any single nation to handle on their own, they could have thought that it would not be much of a burden with the entire continent coming together to contribute to this castle. That was how everyone in the room agreed to building a castle at the Monster\u2019s Desert and sent messages to their home nations for materials and workers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">That happened three months ago. Now, the construction was slowly starting and the marketplace was drawing people over.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Runa started to smile with satisfaction while looking at the construction of the castle, as well as the quickly developing village around it.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The important thing was that there was nobody in that meeting that was knowledgeable about economy. They all believed that a large number of people, stones, and steel was necessary to build a castle. They just accepted it as everyone sharing the financial burden of building a castle, and sat in on the meeting as the representative of their nations.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">That line of thinking was a big mistake.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This construction was at least twenty times the size of the construction of the Castle of Storm. It naturally required that much more workers, and many specialists were required to create the necessary components for the castle.

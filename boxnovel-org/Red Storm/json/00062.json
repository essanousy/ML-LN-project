Librie had never expected Yulian to get here so quickly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Father should be doing well right? I know he can win. I heard they have a large army, but they said the warriors of the largest oasis are the strongest of Pareia\u2019s warriors. Father also has many veteran warriors. I\u2019m sure he will win.\u2019</p><br/><p>Librie was asking and answer her own questions like that as she nervously waited.</p><br/><p>She suddenly heard footsteps outside of the paoe and the cloth hanging over the entrance of the paoe was starting to be lifted.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, how did it go? Yulian\u2026 did you defeat Yulian?\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Librie turned her head to the entrance and shouted, a stoic voice responded as the cloth was lifted.</p><br/><p>\u201cLibrie.\u201d</p><br/><p>Librie turned pale at this familiar voice.</p><br/><p>Yulian and Pere slowly entered the paoe.</p><br/><p>\u201cLibrie\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As Pere\u2019s voice, which was full of forcefully suppressed anger, followed Yulian\u2019s voice, Librie\u2019s legs turned to mush as she just plopped down on the ground.</p><br/><p>Fear had filled her mind.</p><br/><p>Soon, fear had taken over her sanity and ignited the survival instincts that rested deep inside of her.</p><br/><p>Librie quickly kneeled and crawled over to Yulian. Yulian just looked toward Librie who was slowly approaching him with emotionless eyes.</p><br/><p>Grab.</p><br/><p>The place where the traces of her crawling ended was under Yulian\u2019s feet. What she had grabbed was the clothes around Yulian\u2019s ankle.</p><br/><p>\u201cWill you kill me? You wouldn\u2019t? Right? You wouldn\u2019t kill me, someone who was a mother to you in the past, would you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Overwhelmed by the fear that she will die, Librie didn\u2019t care how she looked. All she did was hold on to Yulian\u2019s ankle and beg for her life.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know I was wrong. But you won\u2019t kill me, will you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c......\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that Yulian did not have a response, this time, she grabbed onto Pere\u2019s pants as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cPere, right? You know that at one point, I really did take care of both of you. You both know that.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a time like that.</p><br/><p>As she mentioned, there was a time when everyone was happy. Mairez, Yulian\u2019s birth mother, Baguna\u2019s first wife, and the Mother of Pareia. When Mairez was alive, they were so happy something like this could never even be thought about.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you kill her? Was there a reason for you to even kill my mother?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Pere coldly spoke to Librie, Librie\u2019s face turned completely white.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026 that\u2026 I had no other choice. Right, I had no other choice. Seina only cherished Yulian. She cared more about Yulian than you, her own flesh and blood. There was no way she would go along with my plan. I needed her gone so that I \u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian cut Librie off as he started to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou killed our father the Glow, and you killed Seina, the Mother of Pareia as well. But you wish to live? You really must have a thick skin. Not only am I full of anger, now I\u2019m also sad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes that mean that you must kill me? Hmm? Is that what you are trying to say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThinking about the love we used to share, thinking about the fact that as you mentioned, we once called you mother, I will give you the opportunity to commit suicide. Please stop making yourself look bad and pay for your sins on your own.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pere started to shout at Yulian\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou cannot do that. You absolutely cannot do that. I understand letting Duripue do it because he was a warrior and made the right decision as the head of the family, but not this woman. Absolutely not.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPere!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy mother \u2026 my mother will weep in the afterlife. Father died because he had the position of Glow, but for what reason did my mother have to die? She must be so full of resentment that she won\u2019t even head to the guardian. My mother was a pure woman, but to be poisoned to death without knowing what happened, she won\u2019t be able to peacefully head to the guardian because of this resentment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm~\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulilan let out a long sigh listening to Pere\u2019s anger-filled shout.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe must rip her into pieces until she dies to set an example. This woman needs to feel the pain of breaking apart a family and the resulting pain in our heart. That is the best course of action.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although these were not her biological sons whom she gave birth to, hearing her eldest son saying kill herself, and her middle son saying she needs to be ripped into pieces, Librie understood that no matter what happened, she was going to die today. Once she figured that out, she just started to shout in anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I wanted to do something like this. Your so called father, my so called husband. If he had not acted that way, I would have accepted everything as my fate and just lived in peace. But do you know how your father acted after Mairez was killed?\u201d</p><br/><p>Librie\u2019s eyes were full of anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe obviously didn\u2019t look for me, but he didn\u2019t even look for Seina. Pretending to be a man full of purity, he just longed for Mairez each and every day. If he was going to be that way anyways, why didn\u2019t he just die with her? Of course I knew that he was obsessed with Mairez from a long time before that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Librie started to shake in anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know how Seina and I ended up marrying your father? It was at Mairez\u2019s request. After being married for three years and not becoming pregnant, she told him to take in more wives. Once your father rejected her request, she cried and cried until she convinced him. He then married Seina, and after only having two sons, it was then that I entered this family.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c......\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think I married your father because I wanted to? Because my father was the chief of an oasis, I was forced into this family for the sake of solidarity between oasis. However, if he even cared for me just a tiny bit, I wouldn\u2019t have done something like this. Right, I wouldn\u2019t have done something stupid like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Librie could not stop her tears from flowing. She hated herself and hated her dead husband. Even she couldn\u2019t tell where things started to go wrong.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think your father said a single nice thing to Seina or me since Mairez passed away? Seina had always been an understanding person, and since she liked Mairez as well, she could suppress her feelings and live like that, but I couldn\u2019t do it. Actually, I probably could have suppressed those feelings. If it was only me being insulted, I could have endured it. But what about my Orca?\u201d</p><br/><p>Librie started to shout again as she pointed to Yulian and Pere with her finger.</p><br/><p>\u201cYulian, as the eldest son, you will become the Glow. Pere, you were born with a naturally gifted physique so your future looks bright as a fearsome warrior. But what will become of my Orca?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c......\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOrca was born with the Provoke blood just like the two of you, but he has been weak since he was born. He doesn\u2019t have a firm resolve either. He is a kid who quietly lived under the shadows of his two outstanding brothers. While your father was paying attention to the two of you, he didn\u2019t even seem to realize that Orca existed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLibrie, that\u2019s where you are \u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian tried to say something but Librie was jumping up and down as she continued to shout.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould the two of you understand the feelings of a mother watching her son be treated that way? It wasn\u2019t enough that she was insulted, but watching her own flesh and blood be insulted like that as well, what kind of mother could just watch and let that happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>Librie\u2019s continuous tirade rang throughout the paoe. After screaming for so long, her voice was now hoarse and she had expended a lot of energy. Even so, Librie still did not give up on shouting.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is why I had to come up with a way to forcefully lift Orca up to see the sun. That is why I did this. You both might be thinking that this was unfair, but us mother and son are the ones who really have been treated unfairly!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian and Pere just blankly looked at each other. They could not even think about what to say. In the end, there was a lack of communication.</p><br/><p>His father\u2019s indifference, the two of their lack of interest, and Librie\u2019s lack of understanding had caused this travesty.</p><br/><p>Yulian finally started to speak after a long time.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know? Right before father was poisoned, do you know what the three of us were discussing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy should I care? I\u2019m a dead bitch anyways.\u201d</p><br/><p>At Librie\u2019s cold retort, Yulian let out a long sigh before continuing on.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh~. Right before Orca came in with the poisoned alcohol, we were talking about Orca. In fact, father scolded the two of us saying that Orca was continuing to get weaker because we did not take good care of him. He told the two of us to become Orca\u2019s guardians. Did you know about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI cannot believe you. How can I believe anything you say at this point?\u201d</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t want to believe it. All that would remain if she lost this anger was resentment.</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess there is no point to say something like this now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian was conflicted. Even Pere could not say anything. The fault lied with everyone in the family, not just her.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever...however\u2026 no matter what, I will never understand someone like you who tried to hurt their family.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhatever! You already decided to kill me, so what is the point in saying anything else? Kill me! Whether you rip me apart or hang me to death, do whatever you want. Even after death, my soul will curse you forever. I will make sure to curse you so that I can watch the two of you die a miserable death even while I am in hell.\u201d</p><br/><p>Librie started to shout again.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Pareia was not an easy opponent. He even thought that they only reason they were able to get this victory was because Pareia was not prepared to fight against humans.

However, it does not change the fact that we can fight against Pareia\u2019s ships with the magic boats that the Silence has prepared for us.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The items that the Silence Empire had provided for them were these small boats with levitation magic imbued in them. Crown Prince Shione had gathered a lot of information about Pareia and realized that the reason they were able to grow so large was because of the quicksand river.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">That was why he thought that giving this unified tribe a way to contend on the quicksand river would limit the amount of materials Pareia was getting from the continent, as well as restrict Pareia\u2019s future movements in case their war against the Kingdom started.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There was no way they could build large ships like Pareia\u2019s when they did not know where or when the war might break out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">That was the reason he thought of the small boats, as well as the fact that flaming arrows would be useful because this was not the ocean.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even if they were not enough to destroy Pareia\u2019s ships, Pareia still would not be able to move around as freely through the quicksand river. That was why the three Glows accepted the magic and materials the Silence provided for them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">That was how they came to today\u2019s victory.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cWe need to start now in training at least 30,000 warriors to reside on the quicksand river. This attack may have slowed down Pareia\u2019s invasion by a bit, so we need to utilize this time to the best of our abilities.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The other two Glows agreed with Kinicks\u2019s suggestion. They had already planned on putting 50,000 of the 100,000 warriors by the quicksand river and the other 50,000 to the southern oasis. They were then going to observe Pareia\u2019s movements before making any adjustments to the numbers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">But if there was now a balance of power on the quicksand river, they could keep 20,000 warriors in reserve to move them in either direction much faster than before. There was no way any of them would be opposed to this decision.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cThat is a good idea. We need to first raise the accuracy of our archers. It will also not be a bad idea to think about the future and start building a ship the size of Pareia\u2019s. We need a ship that size in order to continue our development.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As Kupepa agreed and brought up another suggestion, the two Glows agreed with this as well.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cI am suddenly getting more confident. It might not be a bad idea to use this momentum for us to be the ones to invade Pareia.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As Nakatin responded in an energetic voice, Kinicks and Kupepa shook their heads internally but smiled on the outside as they had no desire to destroy this good atmosphere.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">***</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Yulian rushed to the port before relaxing after seeing that the enemy was not chasing after the ships.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He had heard that one of the ships had burned down into the bottom of the quicksand river, but he was just thankful and relieved that the injuries to the warriors was very minimal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Honestly speaking, this was only because Yulian and Runa did not know much about ships. It was the case in the ocean and the quicksand river as well; there was no way for a small boat to catch up to the speed of a large ship.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Maybe the small boats might be faster in the beginning as they first start to catch the wind, but as time goes by, there was no way for them to catch up to a large ship\u2019s maximum speed with their multiple large sails.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Furthermore, Thriger was an individual who used to pretty much rule the ocean. He recognized that something was wrong and quickly ordered the retreat. Although they had been ambushed in a method they never saw coming, they were able to limit the damage to one lost ship.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cWhat about Greatest Captain Thriger?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After listening to Thriger\u2019s first mate, Yulian asked about Thriger\u2019s condition.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cHe received an injury from the enemy\u2019s arrow, but it is not enough to endanger his life.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cThe heavens have helped us.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Yulian was extremely relieved. As Runa had mentioned, they were worried about losing Thriger and the warriors who were adept at ship-related information. That was why they had rushed here without rest. They were extremely worried about what may have happened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Both Yulian and the Red Storm had extremely red eyes after rushing forward for two days without any rest, but Yulian could feel all his fatigue going away knowing that there was not much damage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Yulian felt like he was flying as he moved to the paoe that was used as the control center.

They were small but definitely boats. It was large enough to fit four or five people, and it had a small sail and key that anybody could easily maneuver it with a small amount of training.

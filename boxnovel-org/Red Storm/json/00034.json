If that was not the case, there was no way Baguna would want to celebrate his birthday so extravagantly.</p><br/><p>However, because Baguna was a wise Glow, everyone in Pareia were truly celebrating his birthday, laughing and chatting away all night long.</p><br/><p>In one of their hands was a large glass of alcohol, and in the other, a large piece of meat. Even the women were not being shy and participating.</p><br/><p>Other than the women who were preparing and delivering the food, everybody else was acting the same way as the men were and enjoying the celebration.</p><br/><p>However, an incident occurred.</p><br/><p>In the middle of a large area was where the largest bonfire was located, with many smaller bonfires burning around it. It was the location people were gathered and happily dancing the Fenaca (a traditional Pareian dance where you make a large circle and a small circle and dance around).</p><br/><p>Shareulo was not happy because of the arrogant punk and Janet\u2019s declaration. Janet had come to him later asking for his forgiveness and used his eloquent speech to convince Shareulo to take part in the celebration.</p><br/><p>The desert alcohol was tasty, and their dance was also very pleasing to the eye. Since Shareulo liked drinking alcohol and playing around, Janet wanted to help Shareulo feel better.</p><br/><p>At Janet\u2019s goading, Shareulo was drinking and watching the people dance, making him actually feel a little excited.</p><br/><p>As he was in the middle of emptying his glass, his eyes suddenly turned round.</p><br/><p>A woman wearing a yellow blouse and matching skirt was spinning around dancing. Every time she spun around, her long red hair was creating a circle, forming a unique harmony with her yellow clothes. She was so beautiful you couldn\u2019t help but open your eyes wide.</p><br/><p>Maybe if Janet was next to him, he would have stopped him. However, Janet was not there, as he was far away trying to handle Baguna who was watching the celebration in peace.</p><br/><p>Shareulo started to walk towards the beautiful woman. He then forcefully grabbed the beautiful woman\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>Having her hand grabbed by someone in the middle of her dance, Grace was surprised and stared at the responsible person.</p><br/><p>\u2018What the\u2026\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Once she realized who the perpetrator was, Grace slightly frowned. It was someone she knew.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ve had too much to drink, your highness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grace spoke to Shareulo with a bright expression and calm voice, as if she was trying to console him. Shareulo responded in a slightly slurred speech.</p><br/><p>\u201cI did drink a bit. But who might you be?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease let go of this hand before we continue chatting.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Grace slightly turned her wrist to move her hand out of Shareulo\u2019s grip, Shareulo quickly grabbed her wrist again.</p><br/><p>\u201cI would never imagine that there would be a woman who would resist my touch. Do you even know who I am? I am a prince of the Great Silence Empire.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shareulo\u2019s lecherous personality was starting to come out. And of all people, against Grace Nellisi, the future Mother of Pareia.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I was single, I would have been happy to play with you, however, I am already a married woman.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grace was holding back her anger quite a bit as she said this. She thought that this moronic prince would step back based on her words. However, there was a reason he was called the moronic prince even in the kingdom.</p><br/><p>He was completely drunk and spoke with a red face.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe women here care about virtue? How funny.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are extremely drunk. Please go in and rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Grace tried to remove herself from his grip once more, Shareulo put more power into the hand holding Grace.</p><br/><p>Grace tried to forcefully remove her hand, but Shareulo had a surprisingly strong grip, and she could not free herself without using a lot of force. Of course, if it was anybody else, she would not have had any trouble. However, she needed to take into consideration Shareulo\u2019s identity.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour highness, please let go of my hand. All of the daughters of the desert are precious, however, I am the wife of Yulian Provoke, the Young Glow of Pareia.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing that this gorgeous woman was the wife of the arrogant punk who embarrassed him earlier, he held onto her wrist even tighter.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what? If you come to me, all the riches that you desire will follow you. Stop pretending to be an innocent sheep.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grace could not hold back anymore and was about to use her free left hand when Shareulo suddenly pulled her hand and forcefully embraced her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Grace let out a scream in shock, and the many tribe members around them stopped their dance to see what was going on.</p><br/><p>For a brief moment, people were questioning what was going on, but a few warriors from Chalna Penaka\u2019s camp who realized what was going on came running towards them. Red Storm\u2019s Triquel was among the warriors.</p><br/><p>Surrounded by the murmurs of the crowd, the angry warriors started to head towards Shareulo and Grace. Other warriors who realized the situation later started to head there as well.</p><br/><p>Seeing that something weird was going on, Shareulo\u2019s knights also started to rush towards Shareulo.</p><br/><p>In this inevitably surprising situation, Grace thought about continuing like this and seeing blood, but quickly shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop!\u201d</p><br/><p>At the same time, Grace ducked and spun around while pushing Shareulo\u2019s arm with her right hand. Shareulo felt his body falling forward and needed to let go of Grace in order to prevent himself from falling on his face.</p><br/><p>As Shareulo was flailing both of his arms around and stepping forward to prevent himself from falling, the desert people were laughing at him as they watched. \u2018As expected of our future mother of Pareia!\u2019 This was the thought going through many of their heads.</p><br/><p>In the end, Shareulo looked like an idiot as he faceplanted into the sand. Quickly getting himself up, his face turned red with extreme embarrassment. He could not think clearly anymore after being embarassed twice in one day.</p><br/><p>\u201cImmediately restrain that bitch and make her kneel in front of me!\u201d</p><br/><p>As Shareulo yelled towards all the knights who were standing around him, the knights looked at Shareulo with a blank expression.</p><br/><p>They were the knights of the Silence Empire. Furthermore, they were the Royal Knights (the title only the best knights of the Silence Empire could receive), and cared a lot about their honor.</p><br/><p>From the beginning, they were embarrassed that they had to serve such a prince, but to order the knights who were supposed to protect women to restrain a woman and make her kneel? Was he truly a prince of the Silence Empire?</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you not hear my order?! I said, immediately restrain that bitch and make her kneel!\u201d</p><br/><p>As Shareulo yelled again, the Royal Knight in charge of the mission spoke up.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour highness, I believe you have been drinking too much. I wonder if it would be better to discuss this tomorrow morning?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you trying to make me look like a fool?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Shareulo continued to yell, the Royal Knight looked at his subordinate knights around him. Everybody had a perplexed look on their faces.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you going to disobey the prince\u2019s order?\u201d</p><br/><p>Watching Shareulo who was yelling again, the surrounding knights all let out a sigh internally. The first order of the knights was unquestioned loyalty to the royal family. Especially as Royal Knights, this was extremely important.</p><br/><p>Although they did not want to do it, they slowly turned their bodies and looked at Grace. Their expressions all looked apologetic. They had to use force against such a beautiful lady.</p><br/><p>As the Royal Knights headed towards her, Red Storm warriors immediately stood in front of Grace. Although they did not have any weapons on them as it was a time of celebration, they were planning on blocking the knights even with their bare hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease step aside, valiant desert warriors of Red Storm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Grace\u2019s cold voice, the warriors defending her turned their heads to look at her. As Grace nodded her head, the Red Storm warriors looked at each other before awkwardly moving aside. However, they were ready to step back in immediately if need be.</p><br/><p>The Royal Knights looked at Grace with confusion as the warriors stepped away. They could hear Grace enunciate each word clearly in the continent\u2019s language in their ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess men of the Silence Empire have no problems assaulting women who are married?\u201d</p><br/><p>The knights\u2019 faces turned bright red. The Royal Knight who tried to persuade Shareulo stepped forward and respectfully spoke to Grace.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe ask for the lady\u2019s forgiveness. We are knights who must obey the command of the royal family. However, if you stay still, we will put our honor on the line and make sure that you are safe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOur daughters of the desert trust strong men and warriors. However, we detest men who are strong but have no pride. Do you even know the honor that you are talking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, the knight could care less about what Grace had to say.</p><br/><p>\u2018She\u2019s right, but the fact that we are trying to do this already shows that we have no honor.\u2019</p><br/><p>The Royal Knight was thinking that way as he looked to his subordinates and sent a signal.</p><br/><p>\u2018When we return, I will retire.\u2019</p><br/><p>That\u2019s what the Royal Knight was thinking.</p><br/><p>As they were continuing to be forceful, Grace could not hold it in anymore. Even if they were a strong Empire, with her identity as the Mother of Pareia, she could never kneel in front of them.</p><br/><p>Within seconds, both of Grace\u2019s hands were holding onto her Sosoontas. The Red Storm warriors, as well as other warriors of the tribe also stood in front of Grace. They did not have any weapons, but they had made up their mind to fight with them, and the few women and children who were quick-witted ran to the paoes to quickly get the warriors\u2019 weapons (TL: I\u2019d like to watch them try to bring out the greatswords\u2026).</p><br/><p>As the Royal Knights took out their swords, Grace\u2019s Sosoontas created a cross in front of her body. Even though they were in an unfavorable situation, they would not use any cheap tricks like throwing sand in the knights\u2019 eyes to blind them. The warriors clenched their fists as they started to run forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>A cold breeze carried a booming voice between the warriors and the knights.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It would not be easy to catch up to them and disrupt their movement. A thick sand breeze was created in the 450 meter distance between the two groups.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After chasing Pareia for a while, Venersis felt an unexplainable shock in his forehead. The reason he was able to be called a War God was because he was able to see the entire battlefield at once, and because he had this monstrous intuition that helped him recognize dangers before they happened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Venersis looked around. There did not seem to be anything out of the ordinary other than the enemy\u2019s oasis up ahead.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In fact, there was just a straight line toward the oasis. It even seemed possible to follow that line to charge right into the oasis.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u2018What are they thinking?

It was because even they felt like they could push straight forward and take the oasis at once.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, Venersis trusted this intuition that had been with him for twenty years.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cAll units, slow down.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The lead warriors thought it was weird, but they chose to follow Venersis\u2019s order.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Shuarei\u2019s unit started to slow down, and when Pareia turned their pirmas around to change from a retreat to an attack, the warriors in the front of the Shuarei unit suddenly disappeared underground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The warriors behind them saw the group falling into the ground, but they could not stop the momentum of the pirmas and fell into the ground as well.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Your view is limited on top of a running pirma. In addition, it was worse when there was a lot of warriors in front of you. That was why the Shuarei warriors were falling into the trap one after another.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">By the time Venersis and the lead warriors caught on to the trap, a lot of warriors had already been injured.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cHow?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">One of the Shuarei\u2019s lead warriors let out a shocked question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was terrible. There were fallen pirmas all over the place and other pirmas had stepped over them. There seemed to be more warriors killed from being stepped on by their own allies than the trap itself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cUnbelievable.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">One of the Greatest Warriors let out a shocked statement. How did this suddenly happen?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was the exact route that Pareia had used to retreat. It was not possible to create a trap in just a couple seconds. It was possible that they had created multiple traps in advance, but Pareia\u2019s main force was a large group as well. It would not be that easy to change direction.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was a type of magic, and after taking a look at the terrain, Venersis was able to figure out the secret of this magic.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Pareia had used the height of the area and the sand hill to create an optical illusion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">When Pere first found this line, he had discussed it in great lengths with the other Greatest Warriors and even tested it out himself. The results were very successful.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If you leave some distance and follow this line, it creates a blind spot that the person in the back is unable to see. Even if the person in the front changes directions by a little bit, it still looks like they are moving in a straight line.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">That was why Pere had created a trap in that blind spot in advance, and the results were a success. Unfortunately, the Shuarei slowed down their movement so they were unable to deliver the type of damage they thought they would be able to deliver.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Either way, the Shuarei were in a state of chaos, and their formation was breaking apart. Pere was in the lead of the Pareia warriors to use this opening to seemingly want to pay back for their earlier retreat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They split into two sides as they approached the Shuarei.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There seemed to be a trap prepared in the central area.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u2018I made a mistake.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Venersis could not help but accept the fact that he made a mistake. He decided to chase after the enemy even though he knew the enemy had some type of plan, and he didn\u2019t stop to verify the danger when his intuition clearly told him something was wrong.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The silver lining was that he had ordered the unit to slow down.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cGreatest warriors and lead warriors quickly gather the warriors.

They just picked up their shamshirs.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Venersis and less than one hundred Desert Sword warriors charged toward Pareia\u2019s unit. Their goal was to buy time for the warriors who had fallen into a state of chaos so that they can fix up the formation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">On first glance, it seemed impossible, but Venersis knew that he and the Desert Sword had the strength to do such a reckless maneuver.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They started to cut through the charging Pareia\u2019s formation in a straight line. Although they may be lacking in number compared to Pareia, this charge was strong enough to create an obstacle for over half of Pareia\u2019s warriors.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Pere ordered another Greatest Warrior to continue to chase after the Shuarei. It was true that they had successfully managed to pull the Shuarei into a trap, but the damage was minimal. They needed to use this chaos to cause a lot of damage. They must do this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They had lost a lot of warriors in this chase. If they could not cause a lot of damage right now, they would be the ones with the disadvantage as time went on.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They would not have to feel rushed if the Shuarei charged after them at full speed, but since they lowered their speed, they could not even use half of the traps they had planned in advance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Pere personally led three thousand warriors to clash head on with Venersis and the Desert Sword. He needed to buy time for Pareia\u2019s warriors to attack the Shuarei\u2019s warriors who had not had time to fix up their formation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cYiyaaaaaaaaaaaaaa~!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Pere let out a shout as he clashed with Venersis.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">While Pere and his warriors were barely managing to fend off this War God and his subordinates, Pareia\u2019s main forces made contact with the Shuarei who were still in a state of chaos.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The yellow sand started to become painted red once again.

These Desert Sword warriors really were shockingly scary. Their numbers did not dwindle much at all.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the same time, there was another change. They could hear a shout coming from the oasis.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Pere and Venersis both looked toward the oasis at the same time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Whose flag is it?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Venersis started to smile. It was Buchord and the Shuarei\u2019s 5,000 warriors.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Venersis did not know what kind of scheme Pareia was planning, so he had ordered Buchord to take 5,000 warriors and go around to the left to attack the oasis.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Once this happened, the one to feel a sense of urgency was Pere. Since all of the warriors were out here, there were only a couple hundred warriors left in the oasis.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Pere was hesitating whether he should stop attacking the Shuarei and return to the oasis or continue to push forward and defeat the group in front of him before trying to take back the taken oasis.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cIt\u2019s one thing for me to not pay attention, but can you really afford to be distracted right now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Venersis\u2019s monotone voice could be heard as the sound of the air being cut appeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Pere realized where he was and lifted up his shamshir with one hand to defend against this shining shamshir in front of him, but he could not get into proper form and his shamshir was flung into the sky.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cI cannot kill a warrior without his weapon.

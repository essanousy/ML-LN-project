The Thick Bushed oasis needed to remain in Pareia\u2019s hands.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It mattered that it was the strategic crossroad between the two tribes, but most importantly, it was the port for the Desert Runner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It wasn\u2019t that it would be impossible to transport warriors without a port, but the necessary tasks that needed to happen to transport warriors needed a port to take place. That was why the use of the quicksand river will diminish significantly if they lost the oasis.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The absolutely necessary and only possible to do at port task was of course the maintenance of the Desert Runner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Sandstorms blew across the quicksand river whenever and wherever. These sandstorms did not consist only of sand; they also had small rocks mixed in with it. Furthremore, the strong force of the wind caused extra damage to the ship, requiring routine maintenance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">But if they lost the port to do their maintenance, they needed to use the small port up at the end of the north of the quicksand river that the Desert Runner 0 used to use in the past. If that happened, things would slow down significantly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Seeing Runa continuing to jump up and down in anger, the messenger warrior took out a roll of lamb skin before handing it to Runa.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cThis is the information Pere-nim wanted to send to Runa-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Most messages were verbal to prevent interception if the messenger warrior was captured, but Pere\u2019s desire to thoroughly explain the situation and the fact that the quicksand river was completely dominated by Pareia allowed Pareia to describe the details of the battle and the current situation for Runa to read.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cMm\u2026\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Runa let out a long moan after reading the content. Described on the lamb skin was the information about the terrain of the battlefield drawn out, as well as how they moved throughout the battle. It also included information about the current situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u2018There was a terrain like this?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Runa stared intensely at the image drawn on the lamb skin before falling deep into thought. It was a line that he had not discovered. That was why he was disappointed. If Pere had discovered that line when he was there, he felt like he could have perfectly captured Venersis.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u2018I guess a War God really does get the help of the heavens.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Runa knew that the battle was already over but could not stop staring at the lamb skin with disappointment. After that, he stopped blaming Pere for what happened. He did go against his order, but with a method like this, it was definitely worth a try.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, regardless of all of that, Runa could not help but worry. He could not decide whether to return to the Thick Bushed oasis to lead the defense or continue to push forward and pressure Venersis.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There were only about 30 to 40,000 warriors left in the Shuarei, so if he really wanted to, he could focus on the defense of the oasis by the quicksand river and hold off until Yulian returned. However, that was only possible if the Thick Bushed oasis remained firmly under Pareia\u2019s control.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right now, he needed to decide whether to return or charge forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If he could take that oasis in front of him, and then take back the oasis that was lost in the first oasis, he could cut off the supply route for Venersis and attack Venersis from both sides.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the same time, it would also cut his supply route off and it was possible for him to be attacked by the remaining Shuarei warriors and Venersis at the same time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u2018If the Glow was here, we could just charge forward the the Shuarei\u2019s largest oasis and capture the enemy Glow.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Runa was filled with disappointment once more, but he needed to focus on the matter at hand right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Return or charge.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After debating it for a long time, Runa decided on charging forward. The amount of time it would take for him to return to the Thick Bushed oasis would be similar to the amount of time it would take him to take over two oasis. In addition, he believed that Yulian would soon return to Pareia after receiving his earlier message.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Runa informed the messenger warrior to tell Pere to not fight Venersis head on this time even if the heavens crashed down, as well as to gather all of the reserver warriors in the center to focus on defense. He then started to sharply glare at the oasis in front of him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">***</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There was so much blood soaked into the ground by the Thick Bushed oasis that they were worried it might seep into the oasis. The Shuarei was doing everything they could to take it over, while Pareia was doing everything it could to protect it. Every single skirmish was extremely severe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Pere did not respond to any of the Shuarei\u2019s taunts, and continued to develop traps and set up wooden fences to wait until the Shuarei tried to invade to fight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">You had to give credit to Pere and the remaining Greatest Warriors. They were doing well defending against that Venersis.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Shuarei could not get through Pareia that was only defending, and the only method Pareia had to push the enemy back was the flow of time. Because of that, there were only a lot of small skirmishes and the amount of spilled blood just continued to grow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In addition, hearing that Runa was attacking the Sunlit oasis made them feel more rushed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">5,000 warriors had arrived as reinforcement not too long ago. Where else would these 5,000 warriors have come from? They came from the nearby oases. That meant that it would be even easier for Pareia to take the other oases behind them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">That was why Venersis started to rush a bit more.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u2018We don\u2019t have any more time. We need to somehow take over this oasis and develop our defenses before we pincer that warrior named Runa and capture him. If we can do that, we will win this war.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Venersis made up his mind to definitely take over the oasis this time and called over his Greatest Warriors and lead warriors.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Venersis remained silent even after all of them had gathered in his paoe as he took a good look at all of them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cEverybody has gathered.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Once Buchord announced that everyone had gathered, Venersis stood up from his seat and looked around at the gathered warriors.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Venersis took a long time to look around without saying anything. The moment everybody had looks of confusion, Venersis finally started to speak.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cWe do not have time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201c......?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The silence continued once more.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Everyone who gathered here were lead warriors and Greatest Warriors. They were well-informed about how this war was going. That was why they were able to guess what Venersis meant when he said there was no time. However, what was the meaning of this silence?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cWe will attack once more in three days.

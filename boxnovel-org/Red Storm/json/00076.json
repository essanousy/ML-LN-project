Plus, they needed to distribute the now former Shuarei citizens to their other oasis, and send only Pareia\u2019s people to the new oasis. All of this was quite a lot to handle.</p><br/><p>The Shuarei offered an extra oasis as the ransom to return all prisoners, but after discussing with the chiefs, Yulian rejected that offer.</p><br/><p>It was because the citizens of the two oasis were Pareia\u2019s citizens at one point, and an oasis without people does not help much for the nation\u2019s power.</p><br/><p>Normally, the prisoners taken during war between tribes were returned for a fair amount of ransom, but in a situation like this, the scale was so large that Pareia rejected it.</p><br/><p>The new warriors and women and children will take time to adjust, but since everybody knew that all of the desert were one tribe in the past, they will assimilate quickly.</p><br/><p>Most importantly, because the current Shaurei\u2019s Glow was extremely useless, many of the people of the tribe had been grumbling at the distribution of wealth. So there were many people who thought that being absorbed into Pareia like this was actually a good thing.</p><br/><p>After discussing with the Greatest Warriors, Yulian divided the warriors in half to defend against the Shuarei and the Wikaly in the North.</p><br/><p>There will be some grumbling from the warriors who will be separated from their families, but they were going to be changed in a yearly cycle, and if they were separated from their families, they were promised that their family will be given special treatment to settle the grumbling.</p><br/><p>Yulian dealt with these types of businesses without rest during the day, and at night, he continued to train with Chun Myung Hoon. He was tired, but shedding a lot of sweat with his master actually made him feel refreshed, so he continued to fiercely charge at his master.</p><br/><p>Three months passed by like that and Pareia was now in a state of revival.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>\u201cYulian.\u201d</p><br/><p>After eating a dish called Dongpo Meat made of pina (sheep-like animal) and drinking wine with his master, Yulian was happily relaxing on the bed when Grace laid down next to him and called his name.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Yulian became excited at Grace\u2019s movement and responded, Grace started to caress Yulian\u2019s chest with her hand.</p><br/><p>\u2018Now that I think about it, I\u2019ve been so busy I haven\u2019t even embraced Grace in a while.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yulian suddenly felt sorry and tried to hug Grace when she started to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cHoney, what do you think about taking in another wife?\u201d</p><br/><p>At Grace\u2019s sudden question, Yulian was extremely shocked and shot right up from the bed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you saying out of the blue?\u201d</p><br/><p>Grace stood up after Yulian and answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt has already been five years since we got married, but there is no news of an heir. If father was alive and you were still the Young Glow it might be okay, but since you are now the Glow, you need to think about an heir. Honestly, I am starting to get more and more scared.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am still young and so are you. What is there to be scared about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you are young, you need to hurry and get more wives. By your age, there are many warriors who already have three wives and six children.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian\u2019s face changed color as he answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cEverybody has their own stories. Plus, you need to first have a son. I want to see our child first. If they take after you, whether it is a son or daughter, they will become a great individual. Once that happens, we won\u2019t even need to worry about a successor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grace shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am also full of desire for a child. Honestly speaking, with father and mother passing away like that, the only people left in the direct line of the Provoke family are you, young master Pere, and young master Orca. With both young masters not marrying yet, the household is quiet. Where should I stick my love to? I came from a family with nine siblings so it was always loud but here it is just extremely quiet \u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As Grace bitterly answered, Yulian embraced Grace tightly as he responded.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo not worry much nor be afraid. The birth of a person is determined by the heavens. Plus, lately you\u2019ve been busy dealing with all sorts of complaints coming from the different oasis that you have become weak. Do not do anything for a while and get a good rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThose things are normal to do as the Mother of Pareia. I do not want to push away my responsibilities.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are doing your duties admirably. Who could say anything else about it? If Mother Seina was alive, there would be someone to think about an heir, but is there anybody in this household saying anything to you? Even Pere cannot say no if it is something coming from you, so why are you so afraid?\u201d</p><br/><p>At Yulian\u2019s consoling, Grace started to tear up and tightly hugged Yulian as she spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cI myself am scared. What if I end up not having a child at all? Plus, I heard about how your mother Mairez-nim needed to force father to marry other women. I feel like I will need to do the same\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was an issue between Mother and Father; we can do things our own way. There is no reason to follow what they did.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Grace crying like that, Yulian really came to understand that his wife was a woman as well.</p><br/><p>Seeing her not miss a beat and never pushing anything back, Grace had the nickname of Iron Women amongst the chiefs. He had never expected that she would cry because of this reason.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo not cry. Let\u2019s both think about this for a while before making a decision. But you know, I think this is the first time I\u2019ve ever seen you cry.\u201d</p><br/><p>At Yulian continuing to console her, Grace stopped crying and started to caress Yulian\u2019s back as she continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut eventually, you will need to take in a couple more wives. The desert is a place where there are a lot of women and only a few men. I will look around a bit more before I speak to you about it again. Also, please tell the two young masters to quickly get married. I keep talking to them about it, but they just continue to say they haven\u2019t thought about it yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand. So you can relax a bit now.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed like this had been weighing on Grace\u2019s mind for a while. After letting it all out, Grace quickly fell asleep in Yulian\u2019s arms.</p><br/><p>\u2018Now that I think about it, I have neglected the household because of everything I\u2019ve had to do.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yulian thought to himself as he caressed Grace\u2019s cheek while she slept in his arms. Pere was moving around with him so it made sense, but he had not been paying any attention to Orca.</p><br/><p>\u2018He is the one who is the most hurt from the recent events, but I haven\u2019t paid any attention to him. That is my fault.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yulian decided to visit him since he was thinking about it, and slowly got up to make sure Grace did not wake up.</p><br/><p>\u2018Should I go with Pere?\u2019</p><br/><p>Since Pere was with him all the time, Pere probably did not have any time to go see Orca either. Thinking that way, Yulian started to move toward Pere\u2019s paoe.</p><br/><p>\u201cPere, are you there?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian called toward Pere\u2019s paoe, but there was no response from inside.</p><br/><p>\u2018Where did he go?\u2019</p><br/><p>Yulian tilted his head in confusion and decided he will go to Orca on his own. As he was about to move, he felt some people heading that way and ended up hiding behind the paoe.</p><br/><p>\u2018Huh? Why did I hide?\u2019</p><br/><p>Yulian thought it was weird how he instantly decided to hide and thought about moving again. But he heard an unfamiliar voice and decided to stay hiding.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the place, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI confirmed it in the morning. This is it.\u201d</p><br/><p>After the two men chatted with each other, he heard a third man.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did they put their paoe so far away in the middle of nothing? The Glow-nim and Orca-nim all have their paoes in the middle of nowhere.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRegular warriors like us would never understand their reason. We just need to do what we came to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening to the voices and the footsteps, Yulian could tell there were at least five people. Based on the fact that they were addressing them with respect, there didn\u2019t seem to be any malice behind their actions.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut will it be okay with the five of us? Pere-nim is known for his strength. Wouldn\u2019t we end up being defeated?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is why five of us showed up. Shut up and start digging the trap. The moment he falls in the trap, don\u2019t forget to shoot the Sleep Pin (a weapon used by the desert warriors, it is a weapon that is a blow dart where you put in a needle that\u2019ll make your enemy fall asleep once they are hit. The name is different depending on the poison). He will probably need at least two hits to fall asleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Are they planning on kidnapping Pere? For what reason? The way they are talking doesn\u2019t seem like there is any malice\u2026\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Yulian thought like that before deciding he could not let them continue. In the end, they were planning on kidnapping his younger brother. The moment he started to lift his body up to confront them, he heard the men talking again.</p><br/><p>\u201cWill we need two hits? The lady mentioned she was going to get him extremely intoxicated.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf he end up just falling over there, isn\u2019t what we are doing all for nothing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is all for just in case. But since he just recently ended his fasting prayer, it it possible that he will get intoxicated easily.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian, who was amused at their words, decided to just keep watching for a while. The men never even thought that Yuilan could be hiding behind the paoe and continued to talk.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways, our lady is very cute. Of course Pere-nim is like the number one husband material, but how could she have thought about taking the initiative like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is all because she is like Trebol-nim. Isn\u2019t Trebol-nim\u2019s style the same way to push first and see what happens? Since Pere-nim has not married yet, if she manages to succeed, it is the chance to become Pere-nim\u2019s first wife. Do you think the lady would miss this chance?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Oho.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yulian finally realized who they were and what their goal was.</p><br/><p>A while ago, he went with Pere to meet Trebol\u2019s family, where Pere ended up sweating quite a bit.</p><br/><p>Trebols\u2019 daughter Prada, who had just turned nineteen, looked at Pere with a sparkle in her eye and would not leave him alone.</p><br/><p>Trebol had no thoughts about stopping his daughter and rather encouraged her. With her father in her corner, how could Prada, as someone who inherited her father\u2019s personality, let go of that opportunity?</p><br/><p>She pretty much stuck to Pere, continuously asking questions like \u2018Is there a girl you like? What kind of girl do you like? What do you think about me?\u2019 Yulian recalled how in the end, Pere turned really red and used training as an excuse to slip away first.</p><br/><p>He just found it to be really funny at the time, but witnessing the current situation, she wasn\u2019t someone to take lightly.</p><br/><p>Seeing as how she was able to recruit the family\u2019s warriors to do this, Trebol must be involved in this plot as well.</p><br/><p>He really thought they were a funny father-daughter duo and continued to laugh internally as he just waited.</p><br/><p>Become a patron and get advanced chapters!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

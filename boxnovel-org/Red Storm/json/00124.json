That was why it was important to pay close attention to it.</p><br/><p>In addition, even the warriors with high status never left the maintenance of their equipment to someone else. It was because all warriors felt like that was equivalent to leaving their lives in someone else\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thrint finished maintaining his greatsword and let out a noise of satisfaction as he lifted it up high in the sky into the sunlight. It suddenly made him reminisce about the suffering he went through to lift this stupid sword in the beginning.</p><br/><p>\u201cDinner is ready.\u201d</p><br/><p>A woman who seemed to have no vitality in her face cautiously spoke to Thrint as he nodded his head and responded.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you look so tired?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTired? No I am perfectly fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>As the woman slightly bowed and answered, Thrint shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s not what I meant. Is there something worrying you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c......\u201d</p><br/><p>As the woman kept her head down and could not respond, Thrint approached her and hugged her as he started to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cTalk to me. Tell me what is bothering you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing...it\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>The woman started to tear up after saying that. Thrint let her go as he spoke with frustration.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t know what the issue is unless you say something. As you know, I am not a romantic person, but I am not so terrible to just sit back and watch my woman cry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSob\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The woman started to cry the moment Thrint said \u2018my woman.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cI am frustrated. Just what is making you like this? Is it Verena? Is she being jealous of you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Verena was Thrint\u2019s first wife. Once her name was brought up, the woman quickly shook her head and answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. Verena-nim is very kind-hearted. She is always paying a lot of attention to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen just what is the reason? It\u2019s frustrating.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is nothing. I just\u2026\u2026 There are times when women are like this. You do not need to worry about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thrint sighed internally as he shook his head at the woman\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, dinner is ready.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. I understand. Let\u2019s go in.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Thrint was late, Thrint\u2019s first son Mereo ran out of the paoe to get him. Thrint held the woman\u2019s hand and walked into the paoe.</p><br/><p>Inside the paoe, Thrint\u2019s two wives and four children were waiting for him with payanat (a baked dish using paya, a grain of the desert, which is prepared by soaking it and making it into a dough) and saoota (a dish boiled with potato from the continent and pina meat) among other dishes in the middle of them.</p><br/><p>Thrint sat the woman and Mereo down before taking the center seat on the inside. Once Thrint sat down, Verena started to put food in everyone\u2019s plates.</p><br/><p>Thrint put some saoota in his mouth and chewed on it before swallowing it and starting to speak to Verena.</p><br/><p>\u201cStarting tomorrow, we have three days of group training with the Red Storm, so I will not be home for the duration of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meal time was the time for the entire family to gather together and chat. The desert warriors were very busy, and since each wife resided in different paoes, it was difficult to get everyone together other than during meal time.</p><br/><p>The problems that the family needed to know were discussed with the first wife first regardless of how many wives you had, and the first wife took care of the children and the other wives.</p><br/><p>That type of tradition had been practiced since a long time ago, and the woman who would become the first wife were trained early on by their mothers from a young age to learn the responsibility of their position, so they considered it the greatest virtue to take a good care of the family and assist their husband.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, we may get some allowance from the Glow. I leave it up to you to take care of the little wives and the children.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Verena respectfully answered and looked at her husband with satisfaction. It was a bit difficult with the household atmosphere being strict and quiet, but it was rare to find a husband of Thrint\u2019s caliber.</p><br/><p>He was faithful, and even though he was stoic, he did not lack anything when it came to taking care of the family. Having a dad like that, even the young children in the house did not cause much headache, so Verena could not be any happier.</p><br/><p>Thrint said a couple other things to his little wives and the children and finished the meal in satisfaction before starting to speak again.</p><br/><p>\u201cVerena, let\u2019s talk a bit after dinner.\u201d</p><br/><p>Verena blushed a little as she nodded her head. That meant that he would be spending the night with her.</p><br/><p>Once night arrived and he was left alone with Verena, Thrint asked her a question.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know why Tuomi is acting that way?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Verena asked back in surprise as Thrint suddenly asked about the third wife.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe is frowning all day like someone who has a lot on her mind. I am asking because I feel like something is wrong.\u201c</p><br/><p>Verena was a bit disappointed that her husband was asking about another woman when this was their first time together in a long time, but she decided to be understanding.</p><br/><p>It was because Tuomi was a slightly special woman to Thrint. If it was not for that reason, her husband would have never brought up another woman when he was with her.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, did she say something to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Thrint shook his head at Verena\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>\u201cI asked her but she told me it was nothing and that women are sometimes like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Verena thought for a moment. There were a couple things that came to mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease only stay with her for awhile. I will tell Pona - second wife - so that she will have no complaints as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Thrint made a confused expression, Verena pulled her husband\u2019s hand to sit him down before starting to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe is thinking about Triquel-nim right now. Triquel-nim was a very romantic person, so he is not someone a woman can easily forget.\u201d</p><br/><p>Verena cautiously looked toward Thrint as she said that.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course you are an amazing man as well, but this is a different aspect. Please do not get the wrong idea.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTriquel was a manly man. I will not get the wrong idea. But is that really the reason?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn addition, she does not have a child. Honestly speaking, you are not someone who shows much love, and you are also busier than other warriors, so she is feeling down because she has not felt any love.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thrint nodded his head at Verena\u2019s words and started to speak in a mumble.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard something from Shubeon-nim\u2019s first wife not too long ago. Shubeon-nim was worried about that as well but did not know what to do so he had come to her for advice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm~\u201d</p><br/><p>Thrint let out a long sigh.</p><br/><p>Tuomi was the dead Triquel\u2019s fourth wife.</p><br/><p>After agreeing that the wives and children of the dead Red Storm members needed to be taken care of by the rest of them, the Red Storm warriors each went and brought a wife and children of their dead comrades to be a part of their family. Tuomi was the one Thrint had brought over.</p><br/><p>No matter how much help they get from the side, it was difficult for a woman to raise a child on their own. That was why the families of their dead comrades all followed the Red Storm warriors, and the Red Storm warriors felt like they had done the right thing. There was a positive factor that if they somehow ended up dying, they could be at peace knowing their comrades would take care of their remaining wives and children.</p><br/><p>But the titles of husband and father were in front of the title of warrior.</p><br/><p>That was because a warrior existed to protect the family and the tribe.</p><br/><p>Thrint had thought about a lot of things, but longing was not something you could forcefully get rid of. That was why he could only ask Verena for help.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt would be good if you could take good care of Tuomi. If there is something for me to do, please let me know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo not worry. I will make sure to not cause you to worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Verena.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thrint hugged her and started to caress her back.</p><br/><p>Become a patron and get advanced chapters!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

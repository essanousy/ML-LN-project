Your mother, Seina, is no longer a person of this world. You will also die in this spot. What are you all doing? Capture him! He poisoned Glow Baguna-nim!\u201d</p><br/><p>Now what was this about?</p><br/><p>Who poisoned who?</p><br/><p>How?</p><br/><p>Then Pere realized why he did not faint.</p><br/><p>\u2018Then really, in that alcohol?\u2019</p><br/><p>Pere did not have the time to think anymore. Sharp swords and shamshirs were coming closer to his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been planning a rebellion!\u201d</p><br/><p>As Pere took out his shamshirs and defended against the warriors\u2019 attacks and shouted, Librie answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you are going to die soon anyways, what can I not tell you? It is not a rebellion but a decision for the future of Pareia. Whether it is a crazy Young Glow who says he will attack the Empire or Baguna who will allow such a person to become the next Glow, I am doing this to prevent the destruction of Pareia.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou...crazy\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Librie no longer cared for Pere and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just one person. Why are you so slow! Hurry and kill him and feed Orca the antidote!\u201d</p><br/><p>Pere realized that he could not stay here like this.</p><br/><p>He needed to hurry and let the warriors know. Since all the chiefs brought the warriors of the Oasis, as long as he let them know, they would be able to assemble quickly.</p><br/><p>Pere avoided the swords of the knights and the warriors as he rolled back into the paoe.</p><br/><p>Baguna had yet to lose his consciousness. Baguna had heard everything going on outside, and shouted as soon as Pere entered.</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry! Your brother, take your brother and run!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFather!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThinking about the future of Pareia, your brother is more important than me. I\u2019m sure you can feel that as well!\u201d</p><br/><p>Pere shook his head at Baguna\u2019s shouting.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather and hyung-nim. I will take both of you and escape from here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pere shouted like that as he quickly ran over to Yulian and put him on his shoulders.</p><br/><p>He then headed back to get Baguna, but Baguna forcefully slapped Pere\u2019s cheek and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re always cold-hearted, but why are you so anxious right now that you can\u2019t even use your brain? I know you are strong, but do you really think you could escape with both of us right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>The warriors and Librie who had already come into the paoe responded in his place.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if was not two and just one, no, even if he was by himself, I doubt he could escape.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLibrie!\u201d</p><br/><p>Baguna tried to shout but his voice was not very loud. He was spending a lot of energy just remaining awake in his present condition.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would you?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Baguna asked while staring at Librie, Librie avoided his gaze as she spoke.</p><br/><p>You and your son are too reckless. And when have you given me any warm gazes or touches? Since Mairez died, you\u2019ve never hugged me even once.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust that...for just that reason you did this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t for just that. Our Orca will be like his mother, being unable to shine under the shadow of his two brothers. Even if I die, I could not watch and let that happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Maybe Librie could no longer speak with Baguna; she turned towards her father, her uncle and her cousins as she spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? It\u2019s for your grandson and nephew. Plus, shouldn\u2019t our family handle the honorable position of Glow at least once?\u201d</p><br/><p>The warriors could not easily step forward. Librie had convinced them of this from a long time ago, and they did end up falling for her temptation, but it was extremely difficult to use their shamshir against Baguna, whom they had pledged their allegiance to for a long time.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll all die soon even if you leave them alone, so just kill that punk named Pere. Can\u2019t any of you use your heads?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Librie continued to shout, the warriors who felt less remorse headed toward Pere.</p><br/><p>\u201cPere! What are you doing?! Do you plan on just letting them kill you?!\u201d</p><br/><p>As Baguna started to yell at Pere this time, Pere cried a single tear from each of his eyes as he shouted back.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, I\u2019m sorry. But this revenge..this revenge\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Pere started to make a path through the warriors with his shamshir with Yulian still on his shoulder.</p><br/><p>Pere was so strong that people would even say he was born with a divine power, and because there was a venomous nature to his personality, he had suffered through hell and back during his training to catch up to Yulian.</p><br/><p>Pere was prepared to lose his life, but as he was swinging his shamshir with the goal of vengeance in his heart, the knights and warriors could not easily block him.</p><br/><p>A battle for their lives. As the saying goes, a battle for their lives had started.</p><br/><p>They had only made it about thirty paces outside of the paoe, but both Pere and Yulian\u2019s bodies had a lot of injuries.</p><br/><p>\u2018To die like this\u2026...I can\u2019t die like this.\u2019</p><br/><p>Pere continued to mutter to himself without stopping. How long did he work to make his dream a reality? To die a dog\u2019s death like this; he did not put in so much effort to die like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that right, hyung-nim!\u201d</p><br/><p>Pere shouted while putting power into his whole body.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t care if the strength was not his own and came from his anger or desperation, or even if the power was given to him by the devil. He could not die here.</p><br/><p>Pere swung his shamshir like a storm and fended off the warriors and the knights as he moved forward one step at a time. However, he was about to reach his limit.</p><br/><p>Were the heavens helping him? A savior arrived at that moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cPere-nim?\u201d</p><br/><p>Grace, who was riding a pirma, called out to Pere with a shocked expression.</p><br/><p>After seeing all the other chiefs return but Yulian not being present, rather than waiting for him, she had decided to meet up with him and planned to ride their pirmas through the night as a hike. That is why she had her pirma as well as Yulian\u2019s pirma with her.</p><br/><p>It was a nonsensical coincidence, and the help of the heavens.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister-in-law! It\u2019s a rebellion!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing an escape route in front of him, Pere\u2019s feet became full of energy as he shouted towards Grace and ran forward.</p><br/><p>An average woman may have become anxious, but Grace was not an average woman.</p><br/><p>She was the woman who crossed multiple oasis and quicksands on her own and came to a different tribe to test her husband.</p><br/><p>Grace saw the soldiers of the Silence Empire and the desert warriors running right after Pere and immediately realized what was happening. She squeezed her legs together to make the pirma run. At some point, she had even gotten out her sosoontas and they were in both of her hands.</p><br/><p>As the warriors hesitated at the Pirma\u2019s gallop, Grace had already arrived next to Pere and started to yell.</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry and get on!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Pere was putting Yulian on the pirma, some of the warriors who had regained their thoughts started to run towards them to stop them.</p><br/><p>In response, Grace jumped off of the pirma without much movement and landed on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are throwing dirt in the name of Pareia.\u201d</p><br/><p>The level of shame in these warriors were already as high as it could go; they started to swing their shamshirs at Grace without any response.</p><br/><p>In a normal situation, they would never even dream about waving their shamshir against a woman.</p><br/><p>\u201cHah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Was that the reason?</p><br/><p>Grace, who felt that there were many gaps in their shamshirs, let out a shout and quickly used her sosoontas to take down two warriors.</p><br/><p>After being surprised at Grace\u2019s unexpected reaction, they finally used their full strength to overpower Grace.</p><br/><p>However, by that time, Pere had already put Yulian on the pirma and he was on it as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister-in-law, hurry!\u201d</p><br/><p>Once Pere shouted, Grace rolled her body backwards and quickly got on top of the pirma.</p><br/><p>Her quickness was something even the Red Storm warriors were amazed at.</p><br/><p>The two pirmas started to run.</p><br/><p>\u201cCatch them! To not be able to catch one warrior and a girl, can you still call yourself warriors?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Librie who came after them shouted, the warriors urgently grabbed their pirmas and started to pursue them.</p><br/><p>Librie knew that if she gave them time, everything would be ruined.</p><br/><p>She needed to meet with the chiefs first.</p><br/><p>Librie also got on a pirma and started to head towards the tribe.</p><br/><p>\u2018If my uncle and cousins have any brains, they will make sure they can\u2019t go back into the tribe. I need to finish it in that time.\u2019</p><br/><p>Librie kicked the side of the pirma to make it go faster.</p><br/><p>If she could make it to the tribe first, she would be the winner of this game.</p><br/><p>The command of the Pareia warriors went to the Glow, then the Mother of Pareia, followed by the Young Glow, and when none of the three were present, it would fall to her.</p><br/><p>It was only temporary, but in this situation, that was enough.</p><br/><p>In order to have that command, she had murdered the current Mother of Pareia, Seina, before putting this into action.</p><br/><p>Librie\u2019s two feet continued to kick the side of the pirma.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

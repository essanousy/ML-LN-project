Wouldn\u2019t that be more useful than being here for a defensive battle? The only problem is that in order to use it, I need to get decently close to a castle wall and will require protection from the other warriors.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cIf you can do that, I will personally protect you since protecting you would mean more of our warriors can live.

Many tribes had expected the Shuarei to use the opening once Pareia\u2019s forces headed toward the Eastern continent to strike, and Pareia had expected the same. That was why Greatest Warriors Egane and Vibli were left behind in the tribe to defend against that potential attack. Surprisingly, the Shuarei\u2019s decision was not to attack Pareia, but the other tribes of the Western continent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Nobody could tell the reason behind or even the conditions of the Shuarei\u2019s alliance with the strong nations of the Western continent, but after receiving weapons and soldiers as reinforcement, the Shuarei confidently started to move up north.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The first tribe that had to fight against the Shuarei was the Rivolde tribe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Pareia\u2019s Commanding Warrior Egane was gathering the reserve warriors to deploy some reinforcement, as he urgently sent a messenger to the Eastern continent to inform Yulian of the situation and ask for them to return.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, the 50,000 warriors at the border could not return because of their promise with the Rojini Kingdom.

They also started to rush the invasion of the Silence Empire\u2019s territory a little more as well.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Seventh month in Year 262 of the Continental Calendar.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The fierce battle that seemed to be at a stalemate between the Silence Empire and the Rojini Kingdom finally started to change. The reason for this was of course the fact that the Crimson Desert\u2019s Pareia stopped simply pressuring the Silence Empire and started to actually get involved in the war.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At this point, the continent could not help but become amazed once more at \u00a0Pareia\u2019s strength.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They used the Castle of Storm that many others thought was good for nothing as the base to secure a steady supply route, and that supply route allowed for 50,000 strong warriors to be stationed at the border.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They then surprised everyone by taking over the Silence Empire\u2019s Fedore region within just one week.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was not that the defense of the Fedore region was sloppy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Silence Empire\u2019s crown prince Shaone had ordered them to prepare for an attack from the desert a long time ago, and they had been making their preparations all this time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Although they did not send out masters and extra brigades like they would if they were going against a really strong opponent, they at least had enough soldiers to defend the castle walls. They also had enough supplies stationed there so that they could train the soldiers to be prepared for Pareia\u2019s attack.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Castles would normally survive siege battles even if the strength of the defense was one third of the strength of the offense, as long as the castle was sturdy.

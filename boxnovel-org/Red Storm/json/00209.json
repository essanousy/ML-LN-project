While Yulian was gone, a mountain load of items requiring Yulian\u2019s approval had built up. However, he did not have the time to thoroughly go through them right now. He delegated most of it to different Greatest Warriors before preparing to go back to war. There was no time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry for your loss.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Yulian bowed to his father-in-law, Dejaine.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cSigh~ he sure lived up to his name as the War God of the desert. He definitely deserves it.

However, this old warrior in front of Yulian was no longer that energetic warrior. The deep wrinkles on his forehead, the extremely thin cheeks. All of this showed just how much worry and concerns Dejaine had suffered until now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Glow.

He was a trusted friend of his father, and once his father passed away, Dejaine had been a father figure for Yulian.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Seeing someone who cherished him so worn out looking like this made Yulian extremely sad.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cI seem to be causing sorrow for someone who came back after achieving something big. Furthermore, I am no longer a Glow. Although the Shuarei may have used the strength of the continent, the battle was fair. I was cleanly defeated and need to accept the reality.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cI will personally head over.

I would have hope if my son was even half the man that you are...but it is now your time.Do not worry about me. The warriors must be tired as well.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cI cannot do that. If it was not for Glow\u2019s help back then, would there even be a me of today? I will definitely take the Rivolde back and return everything back to normal.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Dejaine smiled back at Yulian. Although he did not have any luck with his son, he did have luck with his daughter and his son-in-law. He believed Yulian would become a great individual from the first time he saw him; that was why he had no issues with giving his daughter to Yulian for marriage.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cDo not make me look so bad. A Glow who could not protect his tribe does not deserve to be the Glow. Instead of recovering the Rivolde, take over the land and turn it into a part of your tribe. That is the correct course of action. Don\u2019t worry about this old man and go take control.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cWe need to fight them before the Shuarei has time to gain more oases and warriors anyways. That is the reason I came back as well. We have already started to prepare the warriors to head back out, so we should be heading to the Western Desert soon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As Yulian had mentioned, the Shuarei was taking control of the Western Desert very quickly right now without stopping.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After taking control of the Rivolde, there were no more obstacles in their way. There were only three tribes that were still safe from the Shuarei\u2019s invasion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Yulian was planning on taking control of at least two of those tribes before the Shuarei could get there. Since they are going to battle, they would need a base on the Western Desert. They needed to take control of these oases to even think about fighting the Shuarei.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cIt should be possible because the Shuarei are exausted from their restless march forward. But you must absolutely not overdo it for this old man. As you already know as well, Venersis is a scary person.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cI know.

Now stop worrying about me and go do what you need to do.

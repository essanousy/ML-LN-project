Even still, there was quite a lot of information for them to know.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Emperor of the Empire. Once Emperor Shaone Fury Silence II relinquished all power to the crown prince and retired due to old age, Shaone Fury Silence III had to look for important information from even a large pile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The biggest issue for the Silence Empire right now was of course the upcoming war with the Rojini Kingdom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A population of 25 million, 50,000 knights and 400,000 infantry soldiers. In addition, 5,000 members of a Special Forces team made up of people with special skills.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The only kingdom that could take on the Silence Empire with that much military force was that Rojini Kingdom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They had gone through an unexpected reform after a civil war and was growing at an extremely quick pace.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Most importantly, their citizens were receiving a lot of support from the royal family that their national pride was extremely stable. It was something that citizens of other countries could not even dream about.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cDamn it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Shaone threw the information about the Rojini Kingdom before uncommonly swearing. After spending a lot of effort and money, he had finally received information about the strength of the Rojini Kingdom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u2018They have ten war-related weapon masters?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Shaone could feel his head aching. Masters played an extremely important role during war.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">You could consider that a single master had the strength of thousands of knights. Of course they didn\u2019t really have the fighting force of thousands of warriors, but with the right strategy, they definitely had enough strength to have such an impact.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Most importantly, they served as a symbol. The amount of masters greatly impacted the morale of the soldiers. That was why this number of ten brought such a headache to Shaone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Silence Empire had a total of nine masters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u2018Damn it. How could they have ten? Things are getting more complicated. The only thing we have on them is the number of warriors. We should have either not touched them at all or destroyed them completely while they were going through their civil war.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Shaone had such thoughts, but it was already too late to regret it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Shaone pressed down on his temples as he started to look through other files. He then landed on a report about the desert.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Shaone clicked his tongue. His idiotic younger brother had screwed things up, and the diplomat tried to fix things up before actually making things worse.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If the empire had been able to get some warriors from the desert, he would not have such a headache. Things would not be like this if they were able to even get one of Pareia\u2019s third generation warriors, who were known to be at the continent\u2019s master level, as reinforcement.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">But this was also too late to regret. Shaone was not someone to regret anything, so all he could do was curse and hold back his anger. However, he could not help but become angry again after reading the report.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The report indicated that Pareia\u2019s construction of the castle was definitely aimed at the Empire. It wasn\u2019t like he did not expect this, but looking at the construction speed and the size of this castle, it could become a great danger for them in the future.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It would normally not be an issue, but they were currently preparing to go to war with the Rojini Kingdom.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even the Assassin Guild who was a hidden power for him could not properly damage them before becoming disbanded. Shaone had another source of headache.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cHmm?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He then read through multiple pages of information about the desert.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The reason Pareia was suddenly able to develop like this. As well as the unification of the remaining tribes in the Eastern Desert.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Shaone lowered the hand on his temple and rubbed his chin. His cheeks then started to rise toward his eyes as he smiled.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"></span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This warrior, who anyone could tell was not average, was sitting on a sandy hill looking toward the falling sunset as he was deep in thought.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u2018I wanted to make your will a reality, but the time and people are not moving as I wish.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The warrior let out an uncharacteristic long sigh. He had never felt like this since becoming a warrior. This warrior was someone who had always given his best no matter the situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">But his surroundings had given this warrior quite a lot of wrinkles.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He was already over 40 years of age. The fact that he had not managed to achieve anything made this warrior even more depressed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He longed for some people. He really missed them a lot. The wise Glow who understood and relied on him, as well as the other Greatest Warriors. It was because of them that he was able to forget about everything else and show them everything he got. But there was nobody left who could understand him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There were now only people who envied him while leaning on him for everything.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u2018Pareia has now become an entity that we cannot touch unless they show a really big opening.

This must have been the reason this warrior\u2019s heart was so unsettled. He was unable to find a way for his tribe to push forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cVenersis-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At that moment, the warrior looked back toward the voice calling out to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cBuchord.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Venersis called out to the warrior who represented the only group of people he could rely on.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cYour image from the back looks quite foreign.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Venersis put on a bitter smile at Buchord\u2019s words.

He could no longer see the tough warrior who led this group of tough warriors and could only see an average warrior full of anxiety.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cDid the Glow again\u2026\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cNo. I think I just became reflective after seeing the fallen sunset.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Venersis shook his head as Buchord cautiously asked. This type of worry was enough for one person to have.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">But Buchord was not someone who would not recognize such a thing. Buchord had already been running through the battlefields with Venersis for over twenty years already. The years he spent drawn in by Venersis\u2019s pure strength helped him understand Venersis better than anybody else.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cI know that you are coming back from meeting with the Glow.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Venersis looked toward Buchord with disbelief as he started to answer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cIt\u2019s the same everyday.

He wanted to help lessen the burden on the warrior he served, but he didn\u2019t really have any other way but to make him think about other things.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">How could someone dare to try to help him resolve a situation Venersis could not solve?

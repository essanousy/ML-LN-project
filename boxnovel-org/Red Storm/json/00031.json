It is where the patriarch of Chaos lives. They are enemies of the Magic Tower. They believe that the human world is built by the powers of humans and that all you need is human potential to make everything happen. They aren\u2019t necessarily atheists, but they believe that order and god, all of this was created by humans. They aren\u2019t completely wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand the gist of it. Then Mai-nim, you must be on one of those two sides?\u201d</p><br/><p>At Yulian\u2019s question, Mai didn\u2019t know whether or not to share it with Yulian and had a worried expression on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cTruth be told, I don\u2019t like either of them. However, I am here on my own will. The work that I am doing is to seal something here so that it cannot use its power. I guess it\u2019s a bit complicated of an explanation. If you think about it slowly, you\u2019ll understand what I mean.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian thought about it for a while before nodding his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, that explains what I am doing here, and as for what you can do to help, prepare yourself for the chaos. The desert might end up the most dangerous place in the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am unable to seal it on my own anymore. I am doing what I can to suspend it as long as I can, but you can\u2019t prevent the natural order of things from happening with just human strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mai started to draw some lines from the center of the desert.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrepare for the chaos of the world. That might be a war or monsters spreading across the continent. I don\u2019t know what kind of mayhem will occur. If it ends up that the number of monsters go up significantly, the center point is this desert. That\u2019s because this evil being is sealed right here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian\u2019s eyes opened wide.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere will be more monsters than there are now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMonsters continue to regenerate endlessly. The time for humans to rule the world has ended. Rather than saying that, it\u2019s more proper to say that they\u2019ll be purified as a new type of people and be reborn. Either way, if you are a desert warrior, prepare for this chaos. I believe that people can change their fate. If even one more person prepare for the chaos, that will be what helps me out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian could not come to his senses after Mai\u2019s unbelievable words. It was as if Mai was playing a prank on him or telling him an old folktale.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo not take my words as a joke; I hope you prepare properly.\u201d</p><br/><p>As if he could tell what Yulian was thinking, Mai said that to dig the stake deep into Yulian\u2019s heart. Yulian nodded his head and replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy mind is everywhere after suddenly hearing such unbelievable story. However, there are no cons to preparing. You said the monsters will spread from the desert?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince the hole is here. From a long time ago, there were people who sacrificed themselves to seal this thing, and now, I am the one sealing it. I believe that the monsters would still mainly remain around this area.\u201d</p><br/><p>After listening to Mai, Yulian now understood why the monsters stayed in the Monster\u2019s Desert without leaving it. The man in front of him was responsible for keeping it that way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow much time does the desert have to prepare?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mai tilted his head before answering.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure of the exact amount of time. All I can tell is that the seal is starting to get too strong for me to handle. Don\u2019t put on such a serious face since the world is not ending right away, but just start to prepare.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm...I feel like I learned such a large and important truth about the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you end up finding everything out like I have, it feels like it\u2019ll break your head. It\u2019s better to resolve all things simply. Prepare your defenses well since you don\u2019t know when war will break out or monsters will leave the desert. See, how simple is that? Right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian nodded his head at Mai\u2019s words. EIther way, if he achieves his dream, there won\u2019t be much of a problem.</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLooking at you makes me feel happy. Looking at Finn makes me happy; you\u2019re the same.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is Finn?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe crown prince of the Rojini Kingdom.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian opened his mouth in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s one of the Eastern continent\u2019s strongest nations.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not even that surprising. WH\\hat\u2019s more surprising is the fact that in this tiny area, there you, the prince of the desert kingdom, and me, who still has some level of respect in the world, along with a swordsman who can instantly slash low level monsters.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStill\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou ended up a person who knows after listening to my story. We call ourselves the special people. If you learn a little bit more about what is going on, your solidarity with the special people will increase. That\u2019s because we have to work together to survive. Since you are part of the desert royalty, I will give you a small gift. If you need a line to connect you to the continent, sell my name. Whether it is the Eastern or Western continent, if you say my name, there will be some kings who flinch. Of course, you must never tell them that I am here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Watching Mai draw the entire map of the world from his head and listening to him talk about how his name alone would surprise the powers of the continent, Yulian could not help but debate if this was all just lies.</p><br/><p>To be lies, Mai\u2019s tone of voice was too casual and he was speaking as it was certain. But to call it the truth, isn\u2019t this too farfetched of a situation?</p><br/><p>Looking at Yulian\u2019s expression, Mai laughed before speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t have that type of eyes; later, just say it to any of the continent\u2019s powerful royal families. All you have to tell them is that Mai Dreeno and Luff Micklop sends their regards.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mai nodded his head at Yulian\u2019s answer and spoke again.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve been talking for too long after saying I\u2019ll keep it short.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s important for me to hear.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be best if I don\u2019t have to come find you, but if the seal ends up breaking, I will come to visit you in the desert. If Luff knew you were leaving, he would hold onto you to make you stay, so leave while he is sleeping.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I have to at least say goodbye\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian wanted to see Luff, who had been giving him so much pointers, one last time, but Mai stopped him from doing so.</p><br/><p>\u201cSaying your goodbyes will make it harder for you to leave. Nobody can handle Luff\u2019s strength, and since he knows the amount of time I need to cast a magic circle and how I do it, he will definite obstruct it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess I have no choice. If you have not come to visit before I have achieved my dream and prepared all the defenses, I will come once again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo what you have to do. Then I will start the casting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian nodded his head and Mai started to draw the magic circle and throw some magic powder to prepare for Yulian\u2019s teleportation. (TL: This makes me think of the Floo powder in Harry Potter)</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? What are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Luff saw the light pillars shooting up around Yulian from far away, and started to head over, recognizing that the fun playmate he had was leaving.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSee you next time, Luff-nim!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go! Don\u2019t go!\u201d</p><br/><p>Luff looked like he had created a deep bond with Yulian and continued to cry out to Yulian to not leave. This made Yulian upset. If he was going to leave, he wanted to leave together.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook, look. I told you he wouldn\u2019t let you go if he knew. I\u2019ll visit you with Luff to play later, so work hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian could not take his eyes off of Luff, but nodded his head at Mai.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeleport.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mai\u2019s casting ended and once he said the chant, Yulian instantly noticed that the scenery in front of him changed.</p><br/><p>Hot sun. A world of yellow sand. It was the desert.</p><br/><p><end chapter=\"\" of=\"\"></end></p><br/><p>Next up:</p><br/><p>Conspiracy</p><br/><p>Please get rid of him</p><br/>\n</div>"}

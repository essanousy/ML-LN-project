And then move around all you want. Honestly speaking, even without fighting, Glow has already participated in the battle.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBy that you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just thought about it now as well. But it is enough if you consider the Glow and your subordinate warriors\u2019 strengths. You will be able to see a battle firsthand, and that alone will be enough to get you involved in the battle. Isn\u2019t that what we would call catching monsters and earning money?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Yulian was laughing on the inside, he still maintained a calm expression as he answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven so, I can\u2019t believe you would try to use me as bait.\u201d</p><br/><p>Egane responded without the slightest of change in his expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, then please stay beside me and watch how the formations change. That is not bad either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha! I was just joking. So all I have to do is move around like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian quickly took the clothes out of his bag and asked while putting it over himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. That is all you have to do. However, please make sure that you are not surrounded by the enemy. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll realize it after experiencing a few times, but war is the one place you can never let your guard down. Although they may be lacking in strength and abilities compared to you, they have hundreds, no thousands of shamshirs. It will not take long to surround you and capture you, or kill you. You need to remember what the result will be if the Glow is captured. You must definitely remember the consequence of such a thing happening.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. No matter what my strength may be, I know that I am no different than a young warrior on the battlefield. I will not move carelessly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Egane decided that they should now start moving and nodded his head as he responded.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am relieved to hear you say that. It looks like the formation is almost ready. Please start moving ten minutes after the first clash. From here no, I cannot take care of the Glow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must focus on the battle. I\u2019m sure this probably sounds really weird, but I will make sure to learn well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Egane slightly smiled at Yulian\u2019s response and moved his pirma forward to command the troops.</p><br/><p>Warriors carrying Pareia\u2019s red flag stepped in front of the troops, and warriors carrying Shuarei\u2019s yellow flag moved forward not too long after. They were the flag warriors signaling the beginning of the battle.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou Shuarei who do not know the definition of honor. Even this time, you show your dirty personalities. But our Pareia\u2019s Glow, the Desert Conqueror, Yulian Provoke-nim is someone who has the magnanimity to embrace your wrongdoings. It is not too late to do the right thing and give up. If you do, we will help make those honorless blades shine with honor.\u201d</p><br/><p>As one of Pareia\u2019s flag warriors shouted, one of the Shuarei\u2019s flag warriors responded back.</p><br/><p>\u201cListen carefully you weaklings of Pareia. By the order of the Shuarei\u2019s Great Glow, the Desert Mole Hangry Elbotta, the Piercing Bow Recharei Breeze-nim and 20,000 warriors are here to protect all of you. Instead of shedding unnecessary blood, isn\u2019t it better to give up and partake in our Shuarei\u2019s glory?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there any animal as sly and greedy as the desert mole? The Shuarei think a mole is great? WIth such an honorless name, it is preposterous to call it glorious. The Piercing Bow has already been defeated by our Greatest Warrior, the Large Spear, a long time ago. Do not proceed with a battle you are destined to lose and give up now.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was like Pareia\u2019s flag warriors had anticipated what the enemy would say and easily twisted their words. The one to be provoked by their words was Shuarei\u2019s Greatest Warrior, Recharei.</p><br/><p>Recharei urged his pirma forward and lifted up a bow the size of his body and started to shoot his arrows. His arrows surprisingly started to hit Pareia\u2019s flags one by one.</p><br/><p>Ding. Ding. Ding.</p><br/><p>\u201cWaaaaaaaaaaah~!\u201d</p><br/><p>As he pierced the flags one by one, the red flags started to fall to the sand before the flag warriors could do anything. As the flags hit the sand, the Shuarei camp let out a loud cheer.</p><br/><p>Seeing that happen, Egane twisted the spear in his hand as he pressed forward.</p><br/><p>Recharei lifted his bow back up and fired an arrow toward Egane, but Egane used his large spear to block the arrow.</p><br/><p>Jii~iiiiiing~</p><br/><p>It shook the spear so much that it was difficult to believe that it did not pierce through, and Egane felt pain in his wrist. It was definitely bow skills fitting the Shuarei\u2019s Greatest Warrior. However, he had already experienced Recharei\u2019s skills during the last war.</p><br/><p>Back then, Recharei\u2019s arrow almost blew away Egane\u2019s arm. In the end, he was able to approach Recharei and make him retreat within ten attacks, but he was not an enemy you could peacefully approach.</p><br/><p>That was why he recalled the past events and prepared his defense as he quickly pushed forward to Recharei.</p><br/><p>As Egane approached him, Recharei let out his last arrow and turned the pirma around. Recharei recalled the past events as well. He knew he was no match for Egane in close combat.</p><br/><p>\u201cOOwaaaa~aaaaa~!\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, it was Pareia\u2019s camp that cheered on as a different Greatest Warrior, the Scorpion Tail Mabis, recognized his peer\u2019s weakness and headed out to meet him.</p><br/><p>The moment Egane\u2019s large spear aimed for Recharei\u2019s back, Mabis\u2019s spear was stabbing toward Egane\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>As his name indicated, Mabis\u2019s shamshir quickly and powerfully moved in a straight line, forcing Egane to retrieve the spear trying to pierce through Recharei\u2019s back and parry Mabis\u2019s shamshir.</p><br/><p>Claaaaaaaang~!</p><br/><p>First the sound of the weapons slashing through the air, the the sharp noise of the spear and shamshir quickly clashing twice soon followed. Egane and Mabis both had fire in their eyes as they put in all of their effort to defeat their opponent.</p><br/><p>Following that, Recharei, who had turned his pirma back around, worked together with Mabis to pressure Egane, forcing Egane\u2019s spear to shake violently.</p><br/><p>Greatest Warriors usually command between 5,000 to 10,000 warriors, and the Shuarei sent three Greatest Warriors to war with them, but Pareia only had Egane and Trebol, two Greatest warriors with them this time.</p><br/><p>No matter how quickly they managed to squash the rebellion, Pareia\u2019s internal affairs were still slightly chaotic compared to before, with the Greatest Warriors of each oasis tied down at their individual oasis. Since they assumed that Venersis would be the commanding officer for this war, the Angry Brandistock was defending the Deep Deep Oasis.</p><br/><p>Each tribe\u2019s Greatest Warrior, as the name indicates, means they are the best amongst the warriors. The only warriors who can take on the Greatest Warriors are warriors of the same rank, meaning only the Greatest Warriors of the other tribes. But with Trebol leading 5,000 warriors to the back for the pincer attack, he could not come to save Egane.</p><br/><p>Parei\u2019s valiant lead warriors were about to lead their pirmas to support Egane, when, before they could make a move, there was a single pirma that shot forward like an arrow.</p><br/><p>\u201cGlow!\u201d</p><br/><p>The lead warriors realized the owner of the pirma as they shouted.</p><br/><p>With a greatsword in each hand, Yulian rushing forward with his legs fixed on the side of the pirma looked like a piece of art.</p><br/><p>At Yulian rushing forward, the shouts of Pareia\u2019s warriors really reached the zenith.</p><br/><p>None of them even considered that Yulian could lose. Their Glow was a man, no a warrior, who could even catch a Sand Dragon on his own. He was the Desert Conqueror.</p><br/><p>With the shouts of Pareia\u2019s warriors behind him, Yulian quickly interjected in the battle where Egane was struggling.</p><br/><p>Booooooooooong~!</p><br/><p>Yulian\u2019s large greatsword made a loud noise as it cut through the air.</p><br/><p>Tang!</p><br/><p>Yulian managed to fling Recharei\u2019s shamshir into the air with a single swing. Seeing Yulian\u2019s overwhelming strength, the Pareia warriors cheered loudly once more, while the Shuarei warriors\u2019 jaws just dropped.</p><br/><p>Although Chun Myung Hoon had taught him how to use two greatswords to fight against multiple opponents at once, that overwhelming strength was amazing against a single opponent as well.</p><br/><p>Booooooooong~!</p><br/><p>Yulian\u2019s greatsword attacked Recharei one more time, and Recharei became frantic as he used his iron bow to parry Yulian\u2019s greatsword.</p><br/><p>As the situation completely turned in an instant with Recharei and Mabis\u2019s lives in danger, the remaining Greatest Warrior rushed out from the Shuarei camp.</p><br/><p>This Greatest Warrior of Shuarei called the Splendid Light Porangso swung a shamshir as bright as his name, and barely managed to rescue Recharei.</p><br/><p>But that\u2019s all he managed to do. As Yulian leisurely handled Recharei with his left hand and Porangso with his right, the two men were full of disbelief.</p><br/><p>Even if people say that Recharei is weak in close combat, that was only in comparison to the other Greatest Warriors. So this was Recharei, who had at least the same level of close combat skills as a veteran warrior, and one other Greatest Warrior being dominated by one warrior.</p><br/><p>The story about how Venersis effortlessly fought against Pareia\u2019s three Greatest Warriors was known throughout the desert, but Venersis was known as the undisputed Greatest Warrior of the desert.</p><br/><p>But wasn\u2019t this a baby warrior who was barely twenty years old?</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t like they were looking down on him because he was a young warrior, but this was just too much.</p><br/><p>All they could do was put all of their efforts in defending against Yulian\u2019s sword and finding a way to escape from this clash. With this fact that they could not do anything else filling their minds, the two Greatest Warriors could not help but lose their fighting spirits.</p><br/><p>Become a patron and get advanced chapters!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

According to Sesuna, the Royal Knight, Yulian was a master. In addition, Sesuna claimed that Yulian\u2019s level of strength could not be compared to any average sword master.</p><br/><p>What kind of existence were masters?</p><br/><p>Even in the Silence Empire where there were numerous knights, they had less than ten masters. Even in the Rojini Kingdom which rivaled the strength of the Empire, they also had less than ten masters.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is going to be a problem.\u2019</p><br/><p>Janet could feel the headache starting to form.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must be really happy about this. Thanks to you, Yulian\u2019s popularity has soared up to the heavens.\u201d</p><br/><p>Two women wearing thick veils entered Janet\u2019s paoe and started to antagonize him.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a single plan of action entered Janet\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>There was hostility on both sides.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know about the oldest son, but clearly, this woman\u2019s side was hostile with them.</p><br/><p>A force-using master. That was an existence that should not exist in one of the Empire\u2019s provinces.</p><br/><p>When a war begins between kingdoms, magic, sword, spears, the number of masters in all disciplines play a critical role in the war strategy. The Silence Empire, which had an army of 500,000 soldiers only had eight masters.</p><br/><p>There are the rare strategists who claim that a single individual cannot do much in large-scale battles, however, they were rookie strategists who have never experienced war, no, who have never experienced a war that included masters.</p><br/><p>Their strength to push through in a straight line; masters were existences who had so much power than it required three to four commander level knights to barely manage to block them.</p><br/><p>\u2018We must get rid of him. We must DEFINITELY get rid of him.\u2019</p><br/><p>Janet\u2019s mind started to spin quickly. His plan was perfected in a very short amount of time. In situations like this when they had allies in the enemy camp, a shrewd diplomat like Janet could come up with tens of different methods.</p><br/><p>\u201cMadam, you have come.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once the thoughts in his mind were settled, Janet greeted Glow Baguna\u2019s third wife, Librie, with a calm expression.</p><br/><p>He was full of greed. Although this woman wasn\u2019t crafty or smart, he was confident that this woman would get rid of Yulian.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so good that you can have such a calm expression? I asked you to get rid of Yulian, but all you managed to do was make them praise him even more.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even with Librie continuing to antagonize him, Janet did not lose his calm demeanor. Rather, he started to smile while preparing to roll Librie in the palm of his hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo not worry about it. I have a plan to handle this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat plan? You think you have a plan to lower Yulian\u2019s fame?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHoho, Madam, please stop. Today, I will let you know the method to get rid of Yulian.\u201d</p><br/><p>Librie felt her ears opening up and quickly sat down and spoke in a small voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow? There is a way?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. This Janet is someone nobody can ignore, even back in the empire. Originally, I had planned to slowly progress, however, after seeing him today, I can no longer let him be.\u201d</p><br/><p>Librie followed along.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did I say before! Didn\u2019t I tell you from the beginning about how scary that child Yulian is? There are no warriors in the desert who do not know of his name. And two years ago, he gathered the young warriors and created some brigade called the Red Storm, and quickly, he turned all of them to be stronger than most veteran warriors.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething like that happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Janet asked with a surprised expression, Librie got excited and started to continue.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is nobody in Pareia who does not know about it. He said it was a brigade to take down the Shuarei\u2019s Desert Sword, and those Red Storm warriors are so loyal to him that if he told them to \u2018Die!\u2019 they would even pretend to be dead. Do you think that\u2019s all? The majority of Pareia is hopeful that once Yulian becomes the Glow, he will be able to defeat our nemesis, the Shuarei tribe, and unify the desert.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo unify the desert\u2026 he has some lofty dreams.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe problem is that everyone believes that he could achieve such unbelievable dream.\u201d</p><br/><p>Janet was amazed that Librie could speak like that, even if she was full of greed trying to make her son become the Glow.</p><br/><p>He was also curious about how she planned to get rid of the second son, Pere, even if Yulian was removed from the equation.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, it\u2019s not like this is the first time I\u2019ve seen someone like this. I just have to focus on completing my end of the bargain properly. Hehehe.\u2019</p><br/><p>Janet was laughing inside as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am worried about the future of Pareia. If someone so rash becomes the Glow, the foundation of the tribe will start to shake.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly my point! Yulian, that child has such absurd thoughts! To unify the desert...it\u2019s not normal for someone who has not even turned twenty to think he could do something that nobody has managed to do for hundreds of years.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is why Librie-nim\u2019s son Orca must become the Glow and have Librie-nim serve as the regent. That is the way to lead Pareia to prosperity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI appreciate your words. Anyways, how do you plan on getting rid of Yulian?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLibrie-nim\u2019s tribe members have all gathered, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe majority of them are here. Other than the minimum required to protect a young Oasis, they are all here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAround how many are there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAround five hundred or so.\u201d</p><br/><p>Janet started to smile at Librie\u2019s answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat should be plenty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Janet came close to Librie and started to whisper his plan in her ear.</p><br/><p>A smile started to form on Librie\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Next Up:</p><br/><p>Betrayal.</p><br/><p>Thoughts that he didn\u2019t want to bring up again\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The things he worked hard to forget\u2026...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

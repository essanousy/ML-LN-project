And you followed your Heaven\u2019s Mandate to get here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI do not understand anything you are saying.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo not be too curious or try to find out. That is not your destiny. I will tell you what you need to do upstairs.\u201d</p><br/><p>The old woman grabbed Yulian\u2019s hand before starting to speak again.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd up we go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian shouted out in surprise. His body was flying up at a fast speed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you getting surprised at something like this? Old man Chun walked up the side of this wall.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean this wall over here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. He walked up like that all the way to the hundredth floor that I questioned my eyes. They must have that kind of talent in the foreigner\u2019s world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian was thinking that he really couldn\u2019t consider his master in terms of human limits. He felt like five floors would be the limit for himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut doesn\u2019t it feel nice?Using levitation (One of the middle-tier magic. SImilar to the magic that is inscribed in the Desert Runner) to go up this high is not something just anybody can do. Huehue.\u201d</p><br/><p>The old woman was speaking as if it was amusing, but it was not the case for Yulian. When he moved his head to look down, it was scary for even Yulian, who did not fear many things.</p><br/><p>\u2018There won\u2019t be anything left of me if I fall from this height.\u2019</p><br/><p>While Yulian was having that type of thought, the old woman and Yulian had pierced through the clouds and arrived at the top floor of the Magic Tower. Yulian felt a bit relieved once he felt the solid flooring underneath his feet again, but just looking down from the balcony was still pretty scary.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe world is so small when you look at it from here. I don\u2019t understand why everyone is so anxious to go to war and kill each other.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian started to speak at the old woman\u2019s mumblings.</p><br/><p>\u201cEach person has their reason. There are no battles without reason.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRegardless, they\u2019re only going to be alive for about a hundred years.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian was not feeling good because he felt like the words the old woman was saying were directed at him, asking why he continued to fight.</p><br/><p>\u201cI must have upset you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I am just telling you how I feel.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess people have to follow the will of the heavens and your mandate from heaven is that of war. Why they gave you such a brutal mandate, tsk tsk tsk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian saw the old woman clicking her tongue and started to ask.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does that mean? Are you saying I am destined to always be at war?\u201d</p><br/><p>The old woman nodded her head but did not respond.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease explain it to me in detail, senior.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the world, there are quite a lot of people. But not everyone is the same. There are people who know something and those who don\u2019t, the ones who can move and the one who cannot, the ones who can defend and the ones who cannot. And finally, the chosen ones and the not chosen ones.\u201d</p><br/><p>The old woman rubbed her staff. Almost as if she was giving Yulian some time to think it over.</p><br/><p>She then slowly started to speak again.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf there are 10,000,000 people in the world, about 100,000 know something, about 1,000 can move, about 100 people can defend, and only 1 will be the chosen one. That is the ratio that has not changed among people and part of destiny.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian could not understand anything she was saying.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease explain it in simple terms.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am explaining it in a way for you to understand. How nice would it be if that punk Mai explained everything to you beforehand? He knows about everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>The old woman started to grumble.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeople receive their destiny based on this ratio. But in order to return to the will of the world, you need a somewhat special destiny. Within it, a destiny is created where the person living a mundane life is the happiest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm. So you are saying out of 10 million people, the heavens only give a special destiny to 10,000 people?\u201d</p><br/><p>The desert tribes each believed in a guardian of the tribe, and believed in destiny. There were plenty of things to make them feel that way as men who were born in the desert to fight as warriors.</p><br/><p>The old woman stared at Yulian as if she was trying to pierce him with her gaze and started to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is why the destiny of the twelve chosen ones are so shitty.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you perhaps saying I am one of those twelve people?\u201d</p><br/><p>The old woman did not turn her gaze away from Yulian and answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo put it simply, yes. Aizen, who came with you, is also a chosen one as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need to fight in wars because we were chosen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRather than war, it is better to say you fight to protect. Didn\u2019t Mai tell you? In the middle of the desert is the center of the rift.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018The Monster\u2019s Desert.\u2019</p><br/><p>Since he had heard about it before, Yulian quickly started to think about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cMai-nim told me that if I try to know too many things, my head will hurt and did not teach me anything. What is this rift you are talking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt will give you a major headache. However, you are someone we cannot leave in the dark. You may be one of the chosen ones, but you still have one decision left.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA decision?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA shitty decision indeed. Why did the heavens make you decide on such a thing? The more it continues, the more humans break apart from each other.\u201d</p><br/><p>The old woman looked to the sky as she mumbled in lamentation.</p><br/><p>Yulian scratched his head because he knew he had to think really seriously about what was happening to him.</p><br/><p>He selected the opposite path due to sheer curiosity, and it led him to the Western continent, and along the way, so many unbelievable things happened. Now, he had instantly arrived at this unknown continent.</p><br/><p>In addition, now he was at this unbelievable tower called the Magic Tower, and an old woman started to ramble about how he was a chosen one who was destined to be at war for the rest of his life. She was also sighing as she told him that he had a decision to make. He could not understand any of the things that were going on.</p><br/><p>The old woman started to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cListen well, Yulian. Your master should be in the process of finding his path and his answer after realizing the truth.</p><br/><p>Once she started to talk about Chun Myung Hoon, Yulian focused and looked toward the old woman.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen I see you, I see both things that make me relieved as well as worried. The part that I am thankful for is that you possess a strong mental fortitude, endless bravery, and relentless sense of responsibility to easily defeat your destiny.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c......\u201d</p><br/><p>The worried part is that as a member of a desert tribe, you do not know about the Holy Scripture. Without knowing that, I cannot explain anything about the rift.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know a bit about the omnipotent God. I have also memorized everything the tribe\u2019s Guardian has passed down as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was altered to meet the needs of the desert. How should I put it? The father loves all of his children, but does not teach them all in the same way?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><br/><p>The old woman groaned before looking toward Yulian and continuing to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if I try to explain it in the simplest of ways, it will be difficult without knowing the Holy Scripture.\u201d</p><br/><p>The old woman contemplated for a long time before clapping and starting to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. I will give you a short explanation. Listen well. I had to think really hard to come up with this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian started to smile as he answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will listen to it as if it was my master giving me a lesson.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the world, there is a god and angels and devils. Since you are also the king of a nation, you should have read many books right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is a devil? The majority of people call Satan, who was born with the name Lucifer, to be the essence of evil.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am aware of it. The Archangel who descended down after going against the omnipotent god.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh you know about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho would not know about angels and devils? Even our tribe makes sure to teach about religion. Neo Latin-nim, the guardian of our tribe, is one of the Archangels as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt should be easier to explain than I thought then. Then listen well. I will tell you about why the devil split away from the Lord.\u201d</p><br/><p>Become a patron and get advanced chapters!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

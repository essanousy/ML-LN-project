The efficiency and morale of the warriors tended to go down when all of them were not around.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">That was why Yulian had sent the trio after discussing the situation with Runa. It was a way to train them to become Greatest Warriors by having them lead a brigade of warriors.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Of Pareia\u2019s third generation Greatest Warriors, Trebol had already lost his life at war. In addition, Egane and Vibli were getting older and older. So when thinking about the future of Pareia, it was time for a changing of the guards and train new Greatest Warriors.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cWarriors who cannot be touched in the desert will be the same in the continent.

The workers who had gone through the desert many times were relying on their know-how to persevere, but for the people who were going through the desert for the first time, it was painful.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The only thing to make them feel better were the desert warriors who were slowly guiding their pirmas around them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Their eyes seem to radiate as they looked around, and each of them seemed so valiant to the point that you could tell they were not your average person.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was not just in their physical appearance.

It was no wonder the new merchant workers were amazed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The three of them who seemed to be the leader were holding onto two greatswords each that seemed like normal people would never be able to even lift, and managed to split a Giant Scorpion in half with a single slash. The new workers could not stop themselves from being filled with awe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Being protected by warriors like this, they didn\u2019t need to worry about thieves or monsters. Thanks to that, they were able to sleep peacefully at night.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cThe workers seem to be struggling quite a bit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Shubeon started to talk to Edwin.

Well, the majority of those workers are part of the nobles\u2019 guilds, but it is not like they did anything wrong to deserve this. It is making me feel a little bad.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cIf we go a little further, we will see the last oasis before we arrive at the continent.

This caravan has a mountain load of items from the nobles of the Inama Kingdom, so there shouldn\u2019t be much issues. I didn\u2019t expect them to be of assistance for this though. Hahaha.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">While the two men were chatting away, they arrived at the oasis and prepared their campsites. Pareia\u2019as warriors set up their paoes and created a reconnaissance team and a boundary team before getting ready to rest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Once everyone finished eating dinner, Haisha called the lead warriors over to chat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cI\u2019m sure you are all aware that the protection of this caravan is very important for our Pareia as well.

Because of that, Haisha showed them respect whenever they were alone, and the lead warriors followed him with their whole heart because of it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Haisha sent the lead warriors away before calling over Shubeon and Thrint.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cWho shall lead the reconnaissance and boundary teams first?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thrint opened his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cI will go first.

Almost instantly, the lights inside the paoes and tents started to light up.

We have over 50 warriors on reconnaissance; there is no way we would have missed them while looking through this small area. Plus, even I did not hear anything.

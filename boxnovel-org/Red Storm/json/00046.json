He then sent the warriors out and secretly paid attention to the situation in the paoe. But after watching everything, he just decided to return.</p><br/><p>\u2018If it was not her son \u2026 would I just let them go again today like I did back then?\u2019</p><br/><p>Venersis was thinking. He would not kill them because of his pride as a warrior, but he might have taken them as prisoners.</p><br/><p>Venersis grabbed two pouches of water from his pirma and threw them to Pere as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m going to help, I should help properly. Oh, and tell that young warrior that Venersis will be waiting for him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Venersis turned away from Pere who was watching him with a surprised expression and directed his pirma forward. The warriors of the Desert Sword followed after him.</p><br/><p>After watching their backs for a bit, Pere started to do what he needed to do.</p><br/><p>He first pulled Yulian off the pirma and laid him down on the sand. He then poured the shanana on his palm, mixed it with water and dripped it onto Yulian\u2019s dry lips.</p><br/><p>Maybe it was his survival instincts; although Yulian was still unconscious, he drank the water Pere dripped in without letting it spill.</p><br/><p>After feeding Yulian plenty of water, Pere took a couple gulps of water for himself. If you drink too much water while being under the sun, you were guaranteed to become dehydrated. You won\u2019t die if you just drink enough to wet your throat.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is enough for me to survive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Holding onto the water pouch, Pere was relieved that he was able to get enough water he needed for survival and once again started to head for the Rivolde Oasis.</p><br/><p>____________________________________________________________________</p><br/><p>Grace was late. This was because Librie had arrived at the tribe one step ahead of her.</p><br/><p>\u201cCatch that heinous bitch!\u201d</p><br/><p>Librie shouted as soon as she saw Grace, but the chiefs and warriors who were gathered together in shock hesitated.</p><br/><p>There was nobody here who did not know about Grace, the young glow\u2019s wife and the future mother of Pareia.</p><br/><p>How could they not know the person who was always full of energy and working to make the oasis better?</p><br/><p>\u201cMother \u2026 no Librie, you, for what benefit did you hatch such a plot to hurt father and his sons? And what did you just say? Did you just say I was heinous?\u201d</p><br/><p>Grace was angry and started to shout and the chiefs and warriors looked back and forth between the two women before becoming anxious about the chaos that was going on in their heads.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Glow, Young glow, and Pere-nim have all been hit by poison! And that woman\u2019s tribe is currently chasing after the two brothers. Chief-nims, please hurry and seize that woman and save the young glow and his younger brother who are in trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>The chiefs were fidgeting after hearing what Grace said.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing! We need to hurry up and catch that heinous bitch and catch those worse than animals sons of his. Seina \u2026 Seina \u2026 when I went to her paoe, Seina was already dead. I knew something big must have happened so I told my father and cousins to use greeting the glow as an excuse to visit him, and that immoral act was going on! Yulian, that immoral child and Pere knew they were caught red-handed after seeing my father and cousins and hurriedly ran away!\u201d</p><br/><p>As Librie shouted, the chiefs continued to fidget.</p><br/><p>Yarumaha stepped forward and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll chiefs and warriors, immediately escort the two of them and go to the Glow\u2019s paoe. We must first determine if they are telling the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening to Yarumaha\u2019s orders, his warriors captured Grace and Librie.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you all doing! Don\u2019t capture me, capture that bitch!\u201d</p><br/><p>As Librie continued to shout at the top of her lungs, the warriors looked towards Yarumaha and he started to speak to Librie.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease endure it for a little. Since the two of you have different stories, shouldn\u2019t we first go meet with the Glow?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I just tell you that the Glow was poisoned to death by them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yarumaha shook his head as he answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe must verify it. We need to see if the Glow really passed away. My mind is very chaotic as well right now, so Librie-nim, please don\u2019t say anything and just endure. We must uncover the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>At Yarumaha\u2019s stern words, Librie shut her mouth, and Grace also silently followed after him.</p><br/><p>Librie\u2019s tribe warriors were already taking care of loose ends inside Glow Baguna\u2019s paoe.</p><br/><p>There were shamans next to Orca, and the chief shaman Tuma Takaka was next to Baguna.</p><br/><p>\u201cTuma Takaka, what happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yarumaha and the chiefs urgently headed towards him and asked.</p><br/><p>Tuma Takaka looked at Yarumaha and the chiefs running towards him with a devastated expression and started to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cGlow Baguna-nim has left the desert.\u201d</p><br/><p>The people staggered for a bit before falling to the ground.</p><br/><p>Perhaps, they thought probably not, Librie and Grace must have made a mistake when they said that. That\u2019s what they were all thinking as they headed here. After Glow Baguna\u2019s death was confirmed, they had received a great shock. He was the Glow who had earned all of their respect.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho dared to do such a thing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yarumaha and the other chiefs let out their rage and everyone\u2019s attention turned directly to Librie and Grace.</p><br/><p>Librie spoke as if she was shouting.</p><br/><p>\u201cAccording to the law of the tribe, when the Glow, the Mother of Pareia, and the Young Glow are all missing, the command of the warriors and the final decisions goes to whom?\u201d</p><br/><p>The chiefs looked at each other for a second.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe highest ranking person in the Glow\u2019s family.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once Yarumaha answered, Librie nodded her head and started to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen since the Glow, the Mother of Pareia, and Yulian, that immoral child has ran away, then all decisions are mine, correct?\u201d</p><br/><p>All of them were sitting there like mutes who had eaten honey and could not answer. Neither Librie nor Grace were people who they could not treat improperly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI asked if I was in charge of making the decision for the tribe.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Librie asked again, Yarumaha and the other chiefs nodded their heads.</p><br/><p>\u2018I did it.\u2019</p><br/><p>Librie was cheering loudly in her mind.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

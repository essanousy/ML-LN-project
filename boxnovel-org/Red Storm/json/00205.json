The only sources of light were from some shining ores that were providing just barely enough light for humans to see.</p><br/><p>Shine.</p><br/><p>The odd red symbol on the ground could not spread out. It was just roaming around the height of a person\u2019s knee. It was red enough to look like fire, but was just light.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man standing in front of it started to curse as he stretched out both of his arms. A blue light started to pour out of his two hands and started to suppress the red strand of light.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease \u2026 please\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The man continued to mumble as if he was chanting a spell, and his forehead started to become filled with sweat.</p><br/><p>\u201cLuff!\u201d</p><br/><p>He then suddenly shouted out loudly, and another man approached him and stood by his side.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Mai.\u201d</p><br/><p>These two men were exactly Mai and Luff, the two who were under the Monster\u2019s Desert.</p><br/><p>As usual, they were working very hard to seal this annoying seal underneath the Monster\u2019s Desert.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s actually fun for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luff smiled at Mai\u2019s words and lifted up his sword.</p><br/><p>Rumble. Rumble.</p><br/><p>The ground started to shake. The red light disappeared with a shout, but something had already managed to come out of the seal.</p><br/><p>\u201cBalrog?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mai was extremely shocked as he looked toward the demon from another world that had shown up.</p><br/><p>Maybe it was because the ceiling was low, but Balrog held its head low as it looked toward Mai and Luff.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a human. A quite annoying one.</p><br/><p>Mai\u2019s body started to shake at that growling voice. He could not do anything about this fear that did not care for his will.\u00a0</p><br/><p>The one to stand in front of Mai at this time was Luff.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a big one this time. But this one isn\u2019t strong enough to fight me. I already beat one up last time. Right, Mai?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Luff smile while talking to him, Mai nodded his head. What Mai was worried about wasn\u2019t the Balrog in front of him. It was the fact that a Balrog managed to come out of the seal. A Balrog was a demon among demons.</p><br/><p>The fact that such a demon like Balrog managed to push through the seal meant that the seal had become that much weaker.</p><br/><p>\u201cBring it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mai looked toward Luff who was fighting against even that Balrog with a smile and consoled himself.</p><br/><p>\u2018At least a couple years more \u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulations on your victory.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulations on your victory.\u201d</p><br/><p>The lead warriors nearby also bowed and congratulated their commanding warrior once the Greatest Warriors congratulated him first.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is not much that I did. All I did was stand in the front. Today\u2019s victory is a result of everyone working hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>The warriors\u2019 hearts started to shake at Venersis\u2019s stoic response.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut this is just the beginning. All of the desert tribes have started to look down on our Shuarei. It is probably because we have brought in outsiders. But everyone needs to become deaf for this war. Only focus on victory. We will deal with the rest after the war.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt will become difficult if the other tribes start to unite like in the Eastern Desert. I urge you to remember that we need to move very efficiently to prevent that from happening.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease do not worry. It will happen as you said.\u201d</p><br/><p>Venersis looked out toward the Greatest Warriors and lead warriors who finished well with him today and was pleased at what he said.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat. For today, relax and drink all you want.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWaaaaaah~!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Greatest Warriors and lead warriors started to cheer.</p><br/><p>It was okay to do that today. It was the day they managed to completely take over the Rivolde, the largest tribe in the Western Desert.</p><br/><p>The bloody battle at the gate had already continued for many hours. Their stamina really surpassed the limits of humankind.</p><br/><p>But the situation was not favorable for the Red Storm. The Empire\u2019s soldiers were tired and the Red Storm were tired as well, but the Empire still had many more people than the Red Storm.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey~ bastard, hurry up and get up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shubeon shouted loudly as he approached his comrade who had fallen and started to slash the spear-wielders who were trying to pierce the fallen Red Storm warrior.</p><br/><p>\u201cShubeon\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The warrior\u2019s body started to shake as he called out Shubeon\u2019s name and looked toward him.</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard, hurry up and get up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shubeon continued to shout while slashing the continuously approaching soldiers of the Empire, but Shubeon was aware of it as well. It was difficult for a completely exhausted body to get back up.</p><br/><p>More than that, there was too much blood flowing from the arrows that managed to get through the cracks in the armor. This warrior could not live much longer.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard, if you\u2019re going to say something like that, just go ahead and die. If you don\u2019t want to just die, then get up. You\u2019re going to let your kids be fatherless ugh\u2026 fatherless children? You want to put that sadness in the hearts of your friends once again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shubeon really didn\u2019t even have any strength to shout. But that dam bastard was irritating him so much.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fallen warrior looked toward Shubeon who was burdening himself to defend against the enemy and protect him. He could see that Shubeon\u2019s injuries were growing and put on an apologetic smile for Shubeon.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop saying the same thing and hurry up and get your ass up. What is that expression of yours? Fix your face and hurry up and get up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shubeon suddenly felt uncomfortable and started to take more peeks toward his fallen comrade.</p><br/><p>Every one of them was in a line with Violet behind them. All of them were worried. The two warriors next to them moved forward to take some buren off of Shubeon. They wanted to give Shubeon some time.</p><br/><p>But the fallen warrior did not think that way. The entire Red Storm was being burdened because of him. For someone who probably did not even have any strength left. In the end, they would all end up dying because of him. And it would happen quickly.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it. I\u2019m sorry everyone. Please don\u2019t die. And \u2026 I leave it to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The warrior slashed his own throat.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey...you fucking bastard!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shubeon gasped and shouted, and the other warriors around him were shocked as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cThi...this\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Shubeon was trying to say something, but he felt like something was stuck in his throat. He then become extremely angry.</p><br/><p>\u201cOowooooooo~!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shubeon was someone who always had something sarcastic to say to irritate his comrades, but the reason he did that was to hide the fact that he was a very affectionate man. Everybody knew about his stupid attempt to cover his kind nature.</p><br/><p>Shubeon was the one who was the most upset the last time they lost some members. That was the reason he was the one who hated Runa the most. But after losing another member today, nobody knew how it would be after this battle.</p><br/><p>\u201cShubeon, no!\u201d</p><br/><p>Thrint gasped after seeing Shubeon trying to move forward and shouted toward him.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Shubeon stepped forward. Nobody could explain how he was breathing, but he continued to push forward without stopping.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it. Everyone, get aligned with Shubeon. Are you going to let him die like this?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Thrint questioned whether anyone could hear him and started to flail his arms, as he started to move forward while continuing to shout.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d</p><br/><p>The other warriors all started to swear as they moved forward. Everybody, other than Haisha and two other warriors who moved backwards to protect Violet.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will kill them all. Every single one of them!\u201d</p><br/><p>The extremely tough Shubeon of the Red Storm was about to lose his sanity.</p><br/><p>His mumbling started to become less and less coherent, but his strength seemed to sore up as he seemed to recover his energy to swing his sword.</p><br/><p>The other Red Storm warriors started to turn pale after seeing Shubeon becoming like that.</p><br/><p>The subconscious state of losing their sanity.</p><br/><p>This was something Yulian had warned them about since the beginning.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat stupid bastard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thrint wanted to run forward and pull Shubeon back, but Thrint did not have much strength left right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou damn son of a bitch\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It was at the moment that Thrint started to swear and had made up his mind to move forward while allowing small injuries that will not kill him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThrint, step back.\u201d</p><br/><p>The familiar voice coming from behind him. It definitely was a very welcomed voice for sure, but in his current situation, his anger was even greater.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you come just a bit faster!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Thrint turned his head, someone flew right over him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was the short response from the person who lowered his head to look at Thrint.</p><br/><p>Thrint stabbed his greatsword into the ground and leaned on it. Once the tension disappeared, he no longer had any strength left to even stay standing up.</p><br/><p>\u201cShubeon!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He felt like things would work out now.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did it go, sister-in-law?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Pere urgently asked, Grace bit her lips and shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cLibrie had already taken command of the warriors. When I arrived in the tribe, the different chiefs were all surrounding Librie.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pere closed his eyes tightly at Grace\u2019s response. He thought positively, and thought that Librie\u2019s plot was revealed when he saw Grace and the warriors. However, he was discouraged by her words.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Pere spoke with his eyes still closed, Grace shivered as if she didn\u2019t even want to think about it, and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs soon as Librie saw me, she shouted at the crowd to capture me. She said I was the traitor\u2019s wife.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLibrie told them that my husband and Pere-nim killed father with poison...as well as Pere-nim\u2019s mother Sena-nim as well\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Pere\u2019s eyes opened wide. His body faltered as if the heavens were crashing. It was his own will to fall to the ground.</p><br/><p>Pere asked as if he couldn\u2019t believe it.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather\u2026...and mother\u2026\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Grace avoided Pere\u2019s gaze and lightly nodded her head. Pere, who was having a hard time even talking, let out a cry.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! Ahhhh! That bitch \u2026...I curse my lips that called her mother at one point. I will kill that bitch by ripping her to pieces.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pere pounded his feet and flailed his arms as if he could not hold in his anger. Grace just quietly waited until he calmed down before seeing Yulian and running towards him. She started to caress his face gently.</p><br/><p>\u201cYulian \u2026 what should we do about this? Ah, ah, what should we do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Grace was a wise and calm woman, but the things that happened in the last two days, the shock from it, was hard to handle.</p><br/><p>She lamented the fact that she didn\u2019t run to the tribe in the beginning. To lose the lead to that evil woman and become a rebel like this felt frustrating and unfair.</p><br/><p>She even wanted to curse the heavens for causing something like this to happen when her husband was heading towards his dream one step at a time.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Pere finally stopped his flailing and after looking at Grace and Yulian, he approached Tuma Takaka and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cTuma Takaka-nim, seeing you like this truly makes me happy to see you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tuma Takaka was the chief shaman in Pareia, and his powerful strength was the best in the desert. The reason Pareia was able to get eleven oasis and defend against the approaches of the other tribe and even the Shuarei\u2019s Venersis, was because of the strength of this old shaman and his assistance to the three generations of the Provoke family.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026 just what happened? Do you know how surprised I was after hearing Librie\u2019s words? Afterwords, I saw Grace-nim hurrying over and sharing her side of the story and I needed to confirm things with my own eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tuma Takaka wanted to hear the truth from a Provoke. He had been connected with the family since the days of Baguna\u2019s father, and when Baguna as well as his three sons were born, they all received his protection from opponent\u2019s spells. For something like that to happen to these people\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThat bitch, that ruthless bitch attempted to poison father and us brothers. I happened to be doing a fasting prayer to Neo Latin-nim so they failed\u2026...but father and hyung-nim\u2026...Tuma Takaka -nim, how could I pay them back for this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pere spilled his guts as if he was talking to an elder in his own family. Baguna regularly relied on Tuma Takaka as the Glow, but Yulian and his brothers saw him as a highly regarded elder in the family.</p><br/><p>Tuma Takaka felt another shock go through his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026...how could something like this \u2026...how could something like this happen to Pareia?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease take a look at hyung-nim\u2019s poison first. I used the Shuarei\u2019s shanana, but he has been poisoned for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Pere\u2019s words, Tuma Takaka wondered for a bit as to where he got the Shuarei\u2019s shanana from, but he hurried over to Yulian since that wasn\u2019t very important right now.</p><br/><p>Grace was feeding Yulian Pareia\u2019s shanana but handed him to Tuma Takaka as he approached.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe effects of the poison\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The blue flower that was blooming on Yulian\u2019s face was starting to get darker. It meant that the effect of the poison was getting worse. Tumama Takaka thought about the poisons that caused this type of symptom, but even he, who had handled poison for a long time could not figure out which poison it was.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter how I look at it, it is definitely not a poison of the desert. If it was, I would know what it is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone grew more anxious hearing Tuma Takaka talk. They had full confidence that Yulian would live because they had him with them, but hearing that it was a poison even he didn\u2019t know about, everyone\u2019s faces quickly changed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is definitely that bastard!\u201d</p><br/><p>As Grace shouted, all of them looked towards her.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it isn\u2019t a poison of the desert, is there anyone other than that fat pig from the Silence Empire? Librie isn\u2019t bold enough to do something like this on her own. I\u2019m sure that Silence bastard was in the shadows.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone became angry after hearing Grace\u2019s words. Especially the Red Storm warriors, they felt a burning desire to turn the pirma around and go murder all of them.</p><br/><p>Unlike the chiefs and other warriors who couldn\u2019t make up their minds after hearing Librie talk, the Red Storm warriors were extremely loyal to Yulian that they knew something like that would never happen and went against Librie\u2019s orders to follow after Grace. They also knew and understood Yulian\u2019s passion more than anyone else.</p><br/><p>\u201cEverybody, calm down. I will do what I can. Right now, it is best to get far away from here. The chiefs and the lead warriors of the large oasis might be hesitating and taking their time, but the command of the ruler is law. I\u2019m sure they will soon follow after us.\u201d</p><br/><p>As someone with a lot of experience, Tuma Takaka was good at figuring out what the priority was. He asked Pere and Grace.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere do you think we should go?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pere looked to Grace. There was only one place they could go right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Rivolde Oasis is not far from here. I\u2019m sure my father will help us. Librie wouldn\u2019t dare to track us down to Rivolde, so let\u2019s all go there and discuss.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no way anyone else would have any other opinions.</p><br/><p>The group started to head towards the Rivolde oasis.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

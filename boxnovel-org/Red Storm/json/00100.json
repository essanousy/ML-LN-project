Although they still could not compare to the third generation Greatest Warriors of Pareia, they were at the level of the other Greatest Warriors. Two to three Wikaly warriors were falling at their hands each time.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey really are amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Abham could not help but be marveled at the sight.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter how strong they are, they will not be able to escape. As long as they are human, they will not have infinite stamina.\u201d</p><br/><p>Runa spoke as if he was mumbling to himself and quickly waved the flag to move the warriors.</p><br/><p>Although it looked funny that they were moving 20,000 warriors to handle less than 60 warriors, the opponent had that much value.</p><br/><p>\u2018Who knows, they might not be human.\u2019</p><br/><p>Runa was having some thoughts that were contradicting what he had just said, but quickly shook his head. Whether the opponent was human or not, they still needed to catch him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI must move as well. There is too much injury to the warriors. Wouldn\u2019t it be better for me to defend them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Runa urgently grabbed Abham as he started to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou cannot do that. I believe their goal is Abham-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>Abham could only watch the warriors being slashed with despair at Runa\u2019s opposition.</p><br/><p>As Runa mentioned, Yulian was aiming for Abham.</p><br/><p>He determined that Abham was the Commanding Greatest Warrior as he was the first to step forward and wanted to catch him, but there were too many warriors in the way.</p><br/><p>As he continued to move here and there to avoid being completely surrounded, he was starting to get further and further from Abham.</p><br/><p>He even started to worry that the Red Storm warriors\u2019 stamina will fall before he could get to Abham.</p><br/><p>They were still moving vigorously so that kind of worry was not needed right now, but they will eventually reach their limit. He needed to push forward even if it was reckless.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuuuuuuu~!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian took a deep breath. After that, once his body had enough ki, he shouted out loudly.</p><br/><p>\u2018One breath, that will be the end.\u2019</p><br/><p>The moment Yulian made up his mind, his movement started to change.</p><br/><p>\u201cOowooooooo~!\u201d</p><br/><p>Like a flag fluttering in a hurricane, Yulian continuously started to swing his greatsword as he moved forward.</p><br/><p>If there was something in his way, he slashed and stabbed past it without lowering the speed of his pirma.</p><br/><p>He was moving so fast that the Red Storm warriors were starting to fall behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cAbham-nim, please escape!\u201d</p><br/><p>Runa shouted loudly, but Abham shook his head.</p><br/><p>This was an opponent who was showing great strength to fight him. Looking past the warrior\u2019s etiquette, he could not escape while watching the Wikaly warriors fal one by one trying to prevent Yulian from getting closer. That was not something Abham\u2019s pride would allow him to do.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fine, I will think that I am dead and take you on. If we can catch you even at the cost of my life, we will win this war. Our Wikaly will still have Runa.\u2019</p><br/><p>Abham started to let out a loud shout.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, come. I will not retreat!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOowaaaaaaa~!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Wikaly warriors started to forget about their fear of Yulian and Red Storm thanks to the shout of their Greatest Warrior and started to increase their efforts.</p><br/><p>Yulian could not hear anything at that moment. Well, he could hear it, but it was so quiet that you could barely call it noise. The sound of his heart beating that was ringing through his chest and head was the only thing he could hear.</p><br/><p>The distance between Yulian and the warrior he was aiming for was not very far now. Yulian jumped off from his pirma high into the air. Although he didn\u2019t fly high like a bird, the height of his jump in the midst of a fierce battle stole everyone\u2019s attention and made the shamshirs stop moving for a moment.</p><br/><p>Although the amount of time it took Yulian to jump up and land back on the ground was only long enough to blink twice, the only thing everyone could remember was the memory that Yulian had flown like a bird.</p><br/><p>Yulian started to dance as he was running. He was swinging his arm around and jumping up and down. That kind of dance. Maybe it is best to describe it as feeling free moving on his own two feet after being on top of the pirma for so long. Now this may be hard to believe, but he was actually running faster than he was moving while riding the pirma. That was the truth.</p><br/><p>The Red Storm did all they could to follow behind him, As they continued to swing their swords, arms and legs started to fly away as a mist of red blood flooded where they were standing.</p><br/><p>As Yulian and the rest of the Red Storm became covered in blood, they truly embodied their name of Red Storm.</p><br/><p>\u201cYaaaaaaaaaa!\u201d</p><br/><p>Abham shouted toward Yulian who had almost instantly arrived in front of him and ran toward him on top of the pirma.</p><br/><p>\u2018I will kill him with a single slash.\u2019</p><br/><p>The shamshir that he was swinging wildly held that type of desire.</p><br/><p>Boooooooong.</p><br/><p>The unique noise of the greatsword rang through the air and Abham could feel his shamshir that arrived at Yulian\u2019s side widely being pushed away. Although he had not moved his eyes from Yulian, the sight in front of his eyes was changing.</p><br/><p>This warm feeling that hit his face. Abham felt like it took him quite a long time to realize that he had fallen off of his pirma. Yulian, who had broken the legs of Abham\u2019s pirma, tried to get toward the fallen Abham, but the Wikaly warriors protected him with their bodies.</p><br/><p>The Red Storm warriors tried their best to get to Yulian who had advanced far far ahead, but the Wikaly warriors did not easily let them through. Although the Red Storm had strong abilities to charge through, they still did not have enough experience to pierce through a dense formation like this one.</p><br/><p>Until now, Yulian had used his overwhelming strength to create even the smallest of gaps for them to push through, but right now, Yulian was far ahead of them.</p><br/><p>Warriors who cannot move end up being captured. The reason they were able to come so far was because they were running and Yulian was leading in the front.</p><br/><p>The Red Storm warriors continued to shout and used whatever strength they could muster, but as they were starting to become overwhelmed by the Wikaly encirclement, they heard Yulian shout loudly once more.</p><br/><p>\u201cOowoooooo! My warriors, what are you doing! Come to me! It is time to show them your strength!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOowoooooo~\u201d</p><br/><p>The Red Storm started to respond. They started to ignore the shamshirs and started to run forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will gladly take the hit from your shamshir. There is no way it is going to hurt more than my greatsword!\u201d</p><br/><p>Haisha shouted in a loud voice as he started to rile up the warriors.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it, I told you we needed a proper plan!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Shubeon shouted in an annoyed voice next to him, his actions were faster and stronger than anyone else in Red Storm that all the warriors who were hit by Shubeon\u2019s greatsword lost either an arm or a leg. The Red Storm started to sustain some injuries all over their bodies. But they continued to move forward and managed to successfully get rid of the warriors who were around Yulian.</p><br/><p>With nothing to get in his way, Yulian once more started to approach Abham. Everything happened in an instant.</p><br/><p>Booooooong.</p><br/><p>The Wikaly could hear that terrifying noise once more.</p><br/><p>All of the warriors around Abham ended up dead, and although other warriors were running toward them, Yulian had already broken Abham\u2019s shining shamshir into two pieces. Runa quickly tried to lead 500 warriors to prevent Yulian from getting any closer, but Yulian was already too close to Abham.</p><br/><p>Tap.</p><br/><p>Yulian\u2019s greatsword finally landed on Abham\u2019s shoulder. The moonlight made the dark blade shine as the tip of the blade inched closer to Abham\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>\u201cAbham-nim!\u201d</p><br/><p>Runa was regretting that he could not convince Abham to get to safety, and looked toward Abham and Yulian with a shocked expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cOrder them to lower their weapons.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian started to speak after seeing the Red Storm warriors who were covered in blood and starting to slow down.</p><br/><p>\u201cKill me. I will not be lonely as there will be many of you joining me in death.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Abham answered with a cold smile on his face, Yulian slightly turned his wrist and the blade created a small injury on Abham\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you already? I came here to make a deal. I will trade you for my warriors.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Yulian speak so casually, Abham clenched his teeth and started to shout.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave the respect of a warrior! Do you mock me and kill me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Abham\u2019s shout stopped the battle. The Wikaly warriors finally saw that their Commanding Greatest Warrior was captured, and looked at each other with shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing! I told you to kill them all!\u201d</p><br/><p>At Abham\u2019s shout, the Wikaly warriors started to pick up the pace that they had slowed down. The expression on the face of the Red Storm warriors started to turn dark. Their stamina had already hit rock bottom, and they were just persevering with their mental fortitude. They would not be able to last much longer.</p><br/><p>Yulian decided there was no need to see anything else. He had made a mistake. He tried to smudge a warrior\u2019s honor.</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess I was wrong. It will be hard to capture you. Then I will cleanly kill you. You will have died on the battlefield and since we have ended up in danger for your life, I\u2019m sure you will not regret it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian\u2019s sword quickly went up and was right about to come down. But at that moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian stopped his sword at the voice and looked to his side. It was a young warrior who was not over 30 years of age. Well, his body was too small and did not have much muscles to call him a warrior. He might actually be a priest.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll units stop!\u201d</p><br/><p>The lead flags started to move at the young man\u2019s voice, and the oasis instantly became quiet.</p><br/><p>\u2018He is an amazing individual. Is he another Greatest Warrior?\u2019</p><br/><p>As the young man in front of him had more authority than he imagined, Yulian was slightly surprised and carefully waited for the young man\u2019s next move.</p><br/><p>\u201cRuna, what are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow will we protect an oasis without our Commanding Greatest Warrior? I can only agree to his request.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is an order. Kill all of them right now. As you mentioned, if we do not take this opportunity, there will not be another one. Didn\u2019t you see it with your own eyes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe cannot defend this oasis without you Abham-nim. I also won\u2019t have the desire to defend it without you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about, Runa?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think I would have remained here if Abham-nim was not here?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Abham closed his mouth and glared at Runa, Runa continued to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere will be no problems even if those two Greatest Warriors are returned. Please do as I ask.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Runa said that last thing only loud enough for Abham to hear, Abham looked toward Runa with a complicated expression before lowering his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI speak to the Pareia\u2019s Glow. In return for letting the two Greatest Warriors go, release all of the Wikaly prisoners.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey say that a deal is advantageous for the one who agrees later. It is already too late. You must return the two Greatest Warriors as well as all of our warriors you have taken captive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRuna!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Runa agree so easily, Abham loudly called out to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do if you let their warriors go as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Runa spoke to Abham once more.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust trust me. We are just returning to the beginning. I was feeling a bit iffy about using such a scheme to catch such a large fish in the first place. All we have to do is properly capture all of them again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Iffy? He feels iffy after capturing two Greatest Warriors?\u2019</p><br/><p>Yulian was listening to Runa not with shock, but a feeling of admiration.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must be greater than you look, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>As he subconsciously asked Runa, Runa looked toward Yulian and started to smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could I compare with the Pareia\u2019s Glow and the warriors who came this far with just that many people? No matter how it goes from here, please take good care of me from here on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThrilling!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian shouted loudly as his body started to shiver.</p><br/><p>Yulian and Runa, the two men\u2019s gaze made each other start to shiver.</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 4.</p><br/><p>Next up:</p><br/><p><strong>Runa Brink</strong></p><br/><p><em>A warrior who could not complete his coming-of-age ceremony.</em></p><br/><p><em>A warrior who could not even properly swing a shamshir.</em></p><br/><p><em>But in some aspects, his name was the same as fear itself.</em></p><br/><p>Become a patron and get advanced chapters!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

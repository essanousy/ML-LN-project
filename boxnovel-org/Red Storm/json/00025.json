If they were warriors who just became twenty, that meant that they weren\u2019t even veteran warriors.</p><br/><p>Even though the tribe\u2019s greatest warriors and the chiefs of the Oasis were trying to persuade them otherwise, Yulian and Red Storm were still heading to the Monster\u2019s Desert.</p><br/><p>Red Storm\u2019s next training location.</p><br/><p>After seeing that the Red Storm warriors had developed a certain level of skill, Yulian decided on this location for them to experience real battles. Collecting Monster\u2019s Souls was just an extra benefit during the process.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will finally be able to hold our heads up in front of the master blacksmiths who keep complaining that too much money is being spent on our weapons.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everybody started to laugh at Triquel\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Even though they were with Yulian, who had survived in this place on his own, and they were confident in their abilities, the fact that this was the Monster\u2019s Desert still made them all nervous.</p><br/><p>Yulian looked around before speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will set up our paoes here. Since we will be here for two months, you will need to dig deep and make sure that it is sturdy. It\u2019s true that the monsters here are dangerous, but the sandstorms are even scarier than the monsters.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Yulian\u2019s words, everybody got off their pirmas and started to set up their paoes.</p><br/><p>Yulian reflected back to his suffering here during his coming-of-age ceremony as he instructed the warriors to dig deep into the ground, to the point where almost half the paoe was inside the sand.</p><br/><p>Setting up the paoes and putting their containers of water and dried rations inside the paoes took a while. Before they knew it, a few hours had gone by.</p><br/><p>\u201cFall in formation once you are ready.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Haisha shouted out loud, the majority of the warriors started to fall into formation. The few stragglers quickly completed their preparations and joined them shortly.</p><br/><p>Once everybody was gathered, Yulian informed them of the dangers surrounding them.</p><br/><p>\u201cStarting from now, it is truly the real thing. Throw away your laid-back attitudes and make sure to focus. We will be spending sixteen hours a day fighting monsters and eight hours to sleep and eat. If you consider that four of those hours will be spent on guard duty, the duration of our sleep will only be four hours a day. I know that an extreme amount of fatigue will come over us. I also know that it will be dangerous. However, we did not come out here to play. We came here to gain real battle experience; we came to sharpen our abilities.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian\u2019s voice started to get louder.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the battlefield, the enemy will still attack us when we are tired; they will not care if our fatigue makes us slower. Take this time to experience that before it happens in the battlefield. Our enemy will not just be the monsters here; it will also be the dangerous natural disasters that occur here as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian stretched out his hand to feel the wind as he continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you all know this already, but if you see that a sandstorm is brewing, hide underground. Even then, you will need to make sure to keep your eyes and ears open, as there are monsters even underground.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at the warriors with fire in their eyes, Yulian was a bit concerned.</p><br/><p>It was going to be a painful training session.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe last thing I have to say is for you to value your own body. Not just for yourself but for Pareia, and for me, make sure to take care of your body. If you sense that danger is near, work together with your peers around you. I will not forgive any injuries or deaths. Understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, we understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Red Storm warriors responded in unison. They all had at least that much resolution.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat. I will divide you into squads. Haisha, Triquel, Shubeon, and Thrint.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian called the names of the warriors he had considered. Each of them had their own unique talents and amongst the group, they had been labeled the Red Storm\u2019s Four Horsemen. They also had the abilities to live up to that name.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian spoke to the four warriors who answered his call and started to come forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cEach of you will have a squad of twelve members. The remaining eight will be with me. As you are forming your squads, rather than your friends, consider each person\u2019s individuality and abilities as you will need to work well together. I\u2019m sure you understand what I mean. Begin.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as Yulian gave the command, the Four Horsemen started to form their squads, considering each person\u2019s personality and abilities. It took a bit of time, but the four squads were created and the remaining eight warriors came towards Yulian.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat. From here on, we are in competition with each other. The winner will be the squad who can collect the most Monster\u2019s Souls. Of course we will also consider the quality. A regular scorpion\u2019s Monster\u2019s Soul cannot be treated the same as a Giant Scorpion\u2019s Monster\u2019s Soul. On the last day of training, we will determine the first place and the last place squads and great rewards and harsh punishments will be given. I will say it again. This is a battlefield. When the war is over, we need to reward achievements properly. Since that is the case, I\u2019m sure how we treat some of you will change.\u201d</p><br/><p>The warriors\u2019 fighting spirits burned even hotter with Yulian\u2019s words. As they were all prideful warriors who believed they would not lose to anybody else, it couldn\u2019t be helped. Before they were teammates, they were now competitors.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt noon and at midnight. Twice a day, you MUST return to this paoe. Each squad will send two members at a time to protect the paoe. Including me, the five squad leaders will take turns overseeing the protection of the paoe. The remaining amount of time is left up to each individual squad. When to sleep, when to eat, that type of stuff. Any questions?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shubeon lifted his hand high into the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think each squad is capable of taking down a Sand Dragon? Asking for a friend\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian pondered for a bit before shaking his head no.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. If you meet a Sand Dragon, run away. I believe that your abilities are enough to avoid critical danger. However, as I mentioned before, I will not accept any injuries or death. Wouldn\u2019t it be such a waste to go through all that training just to die here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen isn\u2019t it too advantageous for your squad? Since you can take a Sand Dragon down on your own and all\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian smiled. He finally understood what Shubeon was worried about.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m sure the other warriors are thinking about this as well but Shubeon just asked as the representative.\u2019</p><br/><p>The warrior Shubeon had massive strength, and his personality was one where he hated being on the losing end. His name of Three Toras (small animals that live underground and prepare many entrances and exits to their home in case of a predator\u2019s attack) proved that to be the case.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I will only put forward enough power to make up for the four members we are missing. Of course, on the day I am watching the Paoe, our squad will face more loss than any other squad, so I will compensate as needed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven Yulian-nim can surprisingly be so calculating.\u201d</p><br/><p>Triquel started to speak after laughing at what Yulian said.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s obvious. I will also follow the same rules that you are all following. Still, there is no doubt in my mind that my squad will not be last place. I will say this now, the winning squad will receive a big reward while the squad in last place\u2026 well, I\u2019ll leave that up to your imaginations.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey say you need to put the two next to each other to see which is longer and shorter. Who knows? We may be able to see Yulian who needs to give a punishment to himself.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other warriors all started to laugh at Triquel\u2019s response.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. You need to put the two together to tell which is longer and shorter. I am getting a bit embarrassed thinking about giving myself a reward.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Yulian retorted without backing away, the warriors\u2019 laughter became even louder.</p><br/><p>\u201cAny other questions?\u201d</p><br/><p>Red Storm\u2019s Four Horsemen looked at each other before shaking their heads no and responding in unison.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo other questions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen we will start now. I will not say something like I wish you luck. Show me your skills. Dismiss yourselves by squad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The warriors quickly sped off in their individual squads to get an advantage over the other squads.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

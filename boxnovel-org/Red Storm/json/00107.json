Everybody was satisfied with just those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet us run like a hurricane. Let us drench them in red.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian quietly said that to the Red Storm warriors as they quietly followed behind him.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>The Wikaly warriors were full of rage.</p><br/><p>Their morale had spiked up since they overwhelmingly defeated Pareia in the last battle, so trivial issues would not bring their morale down.</p><br/><p>If they did not have that victory, their morale would probably be crawling on the bottom right now.</p><br/><p>The reason was because the trip to the central oasis that should have taken them about a week has taken them longer than half a month.</p><br/><p>It was because Pareia showed up and disappeared like the wind to hinder them, as if they were the Jeria tribe (a wandering tribe without a home oasis. They have special abilities that make others revere them).</p><br/><p>The thing that smaller units had over large units was their mobility and ease of movement. They did not fight. They just showed up without warning and quickly disappeared.</p><br/><p>But it wasn\u2019t like they could just ignore them.</p><br/><p>If they just let Pareia do whatever they want, they would strategically hit them and injure tens of warriors in the process. But more importantly, it was the fear that that group would work together with the enemy Glow and his personal brigade called the Red Storm.</p><br/><p>The Red Storm swung their swords faster than any other Pareia warriors and moved much faster as well.</p><br/><p>In addition, leading them was one of the desert\u2019s War God who could not be stopped by even hundreds of warriors.</p><br/><p>Runa had prepared many schemes to catch them - dig traps, prepare nets, ambushes, etc, but they were all useless.</p><br/><p>That was why their only choice was to stop and create formations whenever the enemy units showed up.</p><br/><p>In addition, since their supply transports were raided, the main unit had to move with the supply carts to prevent further raids. This made their speed even slower.</p><br/><p>At the same time, they had no idea what happened to the unit of Pareia\u2019s warriors that took over the central oases. All they heard was that they moved up north.</p><br/><p>And there was no way for there to be any warriors remaining to defend the oases up north. All of the Wikaly warriors were gathered in the oasis where the Glow resided.</p><br/><p>They wanted to quickly chase after Pareia\u2019s warriors up north, but the 3,000 Pareia warriors behind them would not sit back and let them do as the wanted.</p><br/><p>The morale of the Wikaly warriors which was as high as the sky couldn\u2019t help but slowly fall back down.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d</p><br/><p>As one of the Wikaly warriors started to swear, it created a domino effect and the warriors all started to whisper to one another.</p><br/><p>The lead warriors tried to calm them down, but since they were annoyed as well, they didn\u2019t put much effort to ending the whispers.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh~!\u201d</p><br/><p>Runa shook his head after seeing what was going on.</p><br/><p>Warriors needed to know how to wait and be patient, but he could not see any of that right now. This was the problem cause by having a long time of peace.</p><br/><p>That day, even though Pareia\u2019s warriors were at such a disadvantageous position, he saw how all of them still precisely carried out the leader\u2019s commands. These were valiant warriors who were thoroughly trained.</p><br/><p>If the other Wikaly oases chiefs trained their warriors as Abham and he had done, they definitely would not have let 3,000 of Pareia\u2019s warriors return that day.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe warriors are faltering.\u201d</p><br/><p>Abham was looking around with a worried expression on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they are worried about their families. They know that desert warriors will not harm anyone other than enemy warriors, but it is still concerning.\u201d</p><br/><p>Abham let out a small sigh internally at Runa\u2019s response before speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey really are amazing. To be able to hold back 20,000 warriors with a brigade that is not even 50 people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey have 3,000. I could do the same if I was just hindering speed and not fighting. In fact, I could do it for over one month and not a half of a month like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Abham making the Red Storm into this amazing brigade was not good for the warriors\u2019 morales.</p><br/><p>As the Commanding Greatest Warrior, he should not be saying things like that.</p><br/><p>The expressions on the faces of the lead warriors around him were already turning darker.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are just like an annoying hyena. Just hyenas that wait until you are out of strength before they approach. Nothing more than that, Abham-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>Abham must have realized his mistake at Runa\u2019s words, as he opened up his shoulders and moved his pirma to encourage the warriors. Runa could not help but let out a sigh watching Abham head forward.</p><br/><p>They needed to merge with the 10,000 warriors currently with the Glow as soon as possible to slowly push Pareia out. The enemy had only around 10,000 warriors, and they should need at least another month to get reinforcements.</p><br/><p>\u2018We need to finish it before then. We can\u2019t let them run amok within our territory.\u2019</p><br/><p>Runa thought like that as he turned his gaze toward the quicksand river. There was something that was constantly nagging at him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Did the enemy really travel up the quicksand river?\u2019</p><br/><p>He had thought about using the quicksand river a long time ago, but could not figure out a way to achieve it.</p><br/><p>How could you use something that will drag you in even with the slightest misstep?</p><br/><p>Runa was feeling like something was off, but decided not to pay attention to the quicksand river. It wasn\u2019t like he could stop them even if he knew what they were doing.</p><br/><p>Deep wrinkles were starting to form on Runa\u2019s forehead.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Time quickly passed by.</p><br/><p>Yulian and Red Storm, as well as the individual Greatest Warriors who were leading around 500 warriors each, seemed like they were flaunting that low number as they successfully managed to slow down the movement of 20,000 enemy warriors. The 10,000 Pareia warriors who were in the central oases used that time to move north to an empty oasis and avoided getting pincered on both sides by the Wikaly.</p><br/><p>Runa wanted to quickly catch up to them, but the continued harassment from Yulian\u2019s forces took up too much time.</p><br/><p>Another half a month had passed by when they finally managed to catch up to the 10,000 warriors. He urgently sent a messenger warrior to the Glow\u2019s territory up north to ask for a jointed attack, before starting to prepare a strategy to take back the oasis Pareia had taken.</p><br/><p>A thunder-like message was delivered to Runa who was deep in thought. More of Pareia\u2019s warriors had shown up in the central oases.</p><br/><p>Runa could not help but be completely shocked. They had arrived about half a month earlier than he had anticipated. This was not possible. They could not move that quickly.</p><br/><p>After a while, Runa had to accept the truth. Pareia had taken control of the quicksand river.</p><br/><p>\u2018Since that has happened, are they going to pincer us instead?\u2019</p><br/><p>The moment Runa was sighing in disbelief, Yulian had already merged with Metro who had taken the northern oasis.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou suffered quite a bit, Glow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Metro greeted Yulian and bowed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave the other Greatest Warriors returned?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Yulian asked while getting off his pirma, Metro answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey have all already gathered. Glow, you really are amazing. To do that with just 3,000 warriors.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe heavens have blessed our warriors. It also shows that we have enough strength to receive that blessing.</p><br/><p>Yulian seemed to have changed a lot from this past month of battling. He had always been slim, but now, he had lost so much weight and looked so thin.</p><br/><p>But the powerful muscles of his were still there.</p><br/><p>In addition, his voice was calm and majestic. Metro thought this bloody war was helping Yulian grow and started to smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. This war will prove that to be true.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet us enter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian took the lead and Metro followed behind him. The moment they entered the leader\u2019s paoe, Vibli, as well as the other Greatest Warriors who were covered in dust greeted, Yulian. All of them must have come to strategize as soon as they arrived and did not have time to clean.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe damage?\u201d</p><br/><p>Vibli answered Yulian\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf the 3,000 warriors, we only have about 1,000 left alive. Of them, 300 are seriously injured and cannot fight.\u201d</p><br/><p>To block 20,000 warriors with 3,000 warriors. Even though they did not engage in battle and just annoyed the enemy, it was not something that just anybody could do.</p><br/><p>The fact that the Greatest Warriors personally took charge was the reason this was possible. But there was no way to completely prevent any injuries.</p><br/><p>\u201cCall the priests over to treat them as much as possible. They are heros. They are the heroes who fearlessly fought against the enemy to give our Pareia hope.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have already informed the priests.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is the morale of the warriors?\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, Metro answered Yuilan\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe morale is very high after hearing that our troops have once again taken over the central oases.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe enemy should also be excited because Abham is near. What have you decided to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Vibli answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are still debating it. Regardless of which side we attack, we will be leaving our back vulnerable. The enemy has not made any movements yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are bitten no matter what we do. But we cannot just sit back and wait like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Vibli shook his head. He knew that Yulian was anxious right now, but they could not rush this.</p><br/><p>\u201cGlow, calm yourself. They are anxious as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are at max 20,000 while they are 30,000. I can\u2019t help but worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t we have the Glow with us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian smiled at Vibli\u2019s words. He even thought that it would be great if he could divide himself into two or three and be present all over the battlefield.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe must wait. The one that has taken control of the center is none other than Egane.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Vibli continued to urge Yulian to remain calm, Yulian nodded his head before coming up with an idea.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if we move someone else?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe other side is empty, but the enemy has more warriors than we do. If we just focus on defending the oasis, we should not have any problems.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom what I have heard, it didn\u2019t seem to be well defended.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf an enemy manages to make it this far, it would have meant that the Wikaly was done for. That was why the warriors here were not trained as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Yulian slowly nodded his head, Vibli continued to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter how I look at it, it was completely different than the oasis that Abham was protecting. They are our enemies, but Abham and Runa, those two warriors are really amazing. I never expected the Wikaly to have such warriors.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was not saying this just because he had lost and had ended up as prisoners to the two of them.</p><br/><p>Vibli was one of the people who had originally said that \u00a0they could defeat the Wikaly in a head-on battle even with just 20,000 warriors while Metro used the quicksand river to conquer the center.</p><br/><p>The other Greatest Warriors had agreed with his statement.</p><br/><p>So how surprised were they with the turn of events? Hearing that Egane went back to bring up the 5,000 reserve warriors made them even more shocked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen do we just have to wait forever?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Greatest Warriors looked around at each other at Yulian\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>Each of them shared their thoughts with their expressions, but all of them were hesitating. In a situation like this, the first to move was always at a disadvantage. Only if they could figure out how the enemy was going to move\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>They would not be able to come to a solution even if they discussed for days. In a situation like this, a different type of good news was delivered to them.</p><br/><p>Become a patron and get advanced chapters!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Venersis is, without a doubt, a warrior among warriors. We do not know how many warriors he will bring with him, but we have around 20,000 warriors here right now. We need to first figure out their military strength first.\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the Greatest Warriors, the Large Spear Egane Paisse, shared his thoughts. After hearing what Egane had to say, Yulian asked a question.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there also the possibility that the enemy will strike from the Deep Deep Oasis side?\u201d</p><br/><p>Egane pointed to the front of the Deep Deep Oasis on the map before answering.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis area here has the borders to the Rivolde, Shuarei, and our Pareia. They will not thoughtlessly attack there. They do not want to irritate the Rivolde for no reason. The fact that the Rivolde Glow-nim is pressing on this side is already a tremendous help to us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Shuarei will not expect that we overcame our chaos this quickly and managed to make full preparations. Let\u2019s use this opportunity to try to take back the oasis we lost around 10 years ago as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>All of the people in the paoe looked toward Yulian with concerned gazes. The war they lost that oasis was when Mairez had died.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said that until now, they could not even dream about pushing forward because of our Pareia\u2019s three valiant Greatest Warriors going up against him, right? This war will be different. I will block Venersis and his Desert Sword, so the other Greatest Warriors can start to think about how to take down the other forces and advance forward.\u201d</p><br/><p>At Yulian\u2019s continued words, their gazes turned from concern to anticipation. It was because what Yulian had said was not wrong. They were confident that if it was their Glow, he would be able to defend against Venersis.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Glow can do that, us Greatest Warriors and our troops will break their formation and take back the lost oasis without a problem. If the Shuarei did not have Venersis, they would just be a tribe with large bodies.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Egane spoke with joy, Yulian nodded his head and looked toward his subordinates.</p><br/><p>\u201cI trust that you can do that. And because I have not experienced a war of this magnitude yet, please do not see me as the Glow but as a subordinate warrior and teach me your ways. The ways of war, the methods of attacking and defending in the desert and the wilderness, the actions of a commander \u2026 I still have a lot to learn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will guide you with our utmost sincerity, Glow.\u201d</p><br/><p>All of the warriors in the paoe bowed their heads and shouted. Yulian also raised his voice and answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis war is the first step towards our Pareia\u2019s victory. Looking past Pareia, we must win for the future of the entire desert. We need to win until there will never be a day the desert tribes have to fight each other again. Let\u2019s all work hard for that day.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment all of the warriors\u2019 eyes shined, the patrolling warrior came into the paoe.</p><br/><p>\u201cReporting. Shuarei warriors have appeared around the border. Based on the reports of our spies, the commander of the Shuarei tribe is not Venersis, but the Piercing Bow Recharei.\u201d</p><br/><p>Egane was extremely excited at the patrol\u2019s report and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that true? It really is not Venersis but Recharei?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Both the first and second report indicated it was Recharei. We also got news that the total number of warriors is around 20,000.\u201d</p><br/><p>Egane shouted at the patrol\u2019s report.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe heavens and the Shuarei\u2019s Glow are helping us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Egane was excited and many of the Greatest Warriors looked full of life.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is it not Venersis and some other Greatest Warrior? Could something have happened to Venersis?\u201d</p><br/><p>Never having been in a war, Yulian did not understand the Greatest Warriors\u2019 excitement and asked, thinking something must have happened to Venersis.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt might be a problem. But what we are certain of is that the Glow and the other Greatest Warriors are preventing him from coming out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPreventing? You are saying they are hindering their own tribe\u2019s Greatest Warrior?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is why I mentioned that the Shuarei\u2019s Glow is helping us. It is suspicion. He is worried that Venersis might be staging a rebellion. The members of the Shuarei tribes see Venersis as a War God and the tribe\u2019s guardian, so it makes sense that he is concerned.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian tilted his head in confusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cI cannot understand it. How can he not believe his own warrior.\u201d</p><br/><p>At Yulian\u2019s words, Egane, as well as the other Greatest Warriors started to smile. Their Glow truly lacked that type of political sense. But it might be because he was that way that his charisma to pull people to him had reached the zenith.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeeing other tribes like that, it makes us happy. We serve a Glow who trusts in us to show our strength as much as we want in battle.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are praising me for something obvious. Either way, if Venersis is not involved, our chances for success should increase quite a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even Pareia\u2019s third generation Greatest Warrior, the usually silent \u2018Sharp Teeth\u2019, Trebol, couldn\u2019t hide his excitement as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe must bring over the Angry Brandistock as well. Because it was Venersis, he had to stay back to defend the Deep Deep Oasis, but now we don\u2019t need to do that. Until he shows up, Egane and I can be the focal point as we divide our brigades into two and push forward as much as we can. Before the Shuarei realize the danger and call on Venersis to show up, we need to advance as much as possible. This time, I believe that we can truly take back the oasis that we have lost.\u201d</p><br/><p>At Trebol\u2019s words, the other Greatest Warriors each shared their thoughts as well. Thinking that this war was already won, even some preposterous strategies were brought forward.</p><br/><p>But watching the warriors like this, it actually made Yulian understand the fear they had of Venersis. Listening to them, he also thought that he was still far from becoming a great commander for the tribe.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is the beginning. All I have to do is learn the things I do not know, and strengthen the aspects I am weak at. This is the beginning of the unification of the desert.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yulian reaffirmed his goal once more in his mind.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>\u201cRed Storm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Glow.\u201d</p><br/><p>At Yulian\u2019s loud voice, the Red Storm warriors chanted back.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is our first expedition. It is time to show the world the might of the Red Storm warriors.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOoowoooooooooo~!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope for us to create a legend of being undefeated. We have prepared enough to make that happen. Can you imagine it? Can you imagine us being struck by an enemy sword?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOoowoooooooooo~!\u201d</p><br/><p>The shouts of the warriors.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will decorate the first page of Pareia\u2019s history. We will engrave the name of Red Storm, the immortal brigade in the heart of our enemies. And most importantly, we will take one step forward toward our dream.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOoowoooooooooo~!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDeath is not permitted. Your lives are not your own but Pareia\u2019s life and my life. You must not die and leave behind disgrace. Slash and slash again and live. That is the reason we trained this whole time. Are you ready? Who are we?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRED STORM!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust like our name, let\u2019s blow through like a red storm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOowaaaaaaaaaaa~!\u201d</p><br/><p>The warriors raised their two greatswords to the sky as their morale continued to increase.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Red Storm took their place behind Yulian.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

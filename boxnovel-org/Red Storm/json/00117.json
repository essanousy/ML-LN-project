Then, the moment he felt like there was nothing under his feet, he navigated his ki to slowly lower himself down.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeeing this place again makes me really nostalgic. The last time I was here, I never expected all these things would have happened\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A lot of things had changed. His father had passed away, he had become the Glow, he fought against Venersis, and he conquered the Wikaly.</p><br/><p>Yulian was full of nostalgia for a bit as he mumbled to himself before putting the Golden Turtle on his shoulder and starting to walk.</p><br/><p>\u2018Now that I think about it, I have never been to the other side\u2026\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>The thought that suddenly crossed his head. One side was where Mai and Luff were, while the other side was somewhere he had never been.</p><br/><p>This emotion called curiosity surrounded Yulian.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhatever. I\u2019m just taking a look. There shouldn\u2019t be any problems.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian decided to head down the opposite path and started to quickly move in that direction.</p><br/><p>How long must he have walked? Everything was still pitch black in front of him, but he started to see red lights shooting up from underneath the ground every so often.</p><br/><p>\u2018What is that?\u2019</p><br/><p>Yulian had a surprised expression as he started to run forward. The area in front of him was still pitch black, but the monstrous symbols underneath his feet all started to radiate in a red light.</p><br/><p>\u2018What could it be? The sealed area is in the opposite direction\u2026 is there perhaps some type of crystal that glows red underneath the ground?\u2019</p><br/><p>Yulian hesitated for a while before bending over and putting his hand lightly onto a symbol.</p><br/><p>\u2018Oh?\u2019</p><br/><p>He then instantly felt like his body was being sucked in.</p><br/><p>Yulian had briefly lost his consciousness from that odd feeling. When he regained his consciousness, he was floating in the air. He was floating in a sky full of auroras in every direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Yulian anxiously shouted, he felt his body being sucked in one more time.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Chirp chirp chirp.</p><br/><p>A wind as soft as cream soup was blowing, and the sound of birds chirping could be heard in this plain that was full of the refreshing fragrance of the flower and grass. Unlike the sticky and burning heat that he was used to, Yulian woke up to a refreshing and chilly wind hitting his face.</p><br/><p>Bushes.</p><br/><p>The thing that Yulian saw as soon as he opened his eyes was the green light of the sun that was breaking apart through some tree branches. Seeing this environment that he had never experienced before, even though he had opened his eyes, Yulian just continued to lay down and move his eye around.</p><br/><p>A small animal had been staring at Yulian from the bush, but once their eyes met, it quickly ran away into the bush without looking back.</p><br/><p>\u2018Am I dreaming?\u2019</p><br/><p>There was no way a place like this would be in the desert. There were trees, flowers, and even that green sunlight in the desert, but it did not feel like this. Wasn\u2019t this place like the place in the desert, that forest place that is said to be full of bushes?</p><br/><p>After laying around like that for a long time, Yulian abruptly stood up. This sensation was too realistic to be a dream.</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible!\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the real world, and this was absolutely not the desert. There was nowhere in the desert that looked like this.</p><br/><p>Yulian quickly looked around him. He was looking for some type of marking.</p><br/><p>Those monstrous symbols that he had seen on his way here. He realized that those must have been the instant teleportation magic circle that Mai had shown him last time. But no matter how much he looked around, the only thing around him were trees that showed off the width the size of two warriors\u2019 heights.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! I shouldn\u2019t have gone that way without asking. I should have met with Mai-nim first and asked. That would have resolved my curiosity, wouldn\u2019t it?:</p><br/><p>Yulian was regretting his actions, but it was already too late.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter what, there should be people living here, and since he said you cannot move very far with a magic circle, I should start looking around.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thankfully, the two greatswords on his side were still right there, so he wasn\u2019t too worried.</p><br/><p>Yulian slashed the small bushes, weeds, and branches in his way as he moved forward.</p><br/><p>How long must he have traveled like that? His sensitive ears could hear the sound of weapons clashing not too far away.</p><br/><p>\u2018There are people nearby.\u2019</p><br/><p>He was so happy about the fact that there were people that he didn\u2019t care that someone was fighting, and Yulian quickly started to run toward the sound of the weapons.</p><br/><p>The sound started to get closer as he continued to run, and Yulian saw a surprising scene where a man with white hair being attacked by people wearing black armors.</p><br/><p>Next to the young man who was surrounded, was a girl wearing a white outfit who had fainted. She too, unsurprisingly, had beautiful white hair.</p><br/><p>Yulian could feel his heart starting to beat quickly seeing that woman.</p><br/><p>And he was shocked. He never expected there to be another girl as beautiful as Grace in this world, but that woman who had fainted was as beautiful as Grace. The only difference was that while Grace looked strong, the fainted woman looked a bit weaker. That was the only difference.</p><br/><p>Yulian turned his gaze back to the white-haired man. The man was showing so much skill that Yulian\u2019s hand subconscious went to the greatsword at his waist.</p><br/><p>There were already tens of armored soldiers fallen around him, but there were too many armored warriors surrounding him.</p><br/><p>In addition, the pressure coming from the man with the black cape who was surrounded by the armored warriors was overbearing as well.</p><br/><p>As time went by, the white haired man was starting to be pushed back, and the armored warriors reached toward the fainted woman from time to time, but the white haired man did everything he could to prevent them.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know what the consequences may be, but Yulian made up his mind to first help the white haired man and started to move.</p><br/><p>As Yulian instantly swung his two greatswords and clashed against the armored warriors, both sides sent gazes of shock toward him. Yulian pierced through the armored warriors\u2019 encirclement and arrived next to the white haired man and started to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought it would be the right thing to help you. You\u2019re not a bad person, are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c......\u201d</p><br/><p>The white haired man had a confused expression.</p><br/><p>Yulian realized he spoke in the desert language and switched the the language of the continent before saying the same thing again.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought it would be the right thing to help you. You\u2019re not a bad person, are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Thankfully, he must be in the Eastern continent as the man nodded his head as if he understood what Yulian was saying.</p><br/><p>It really was a stupid question, but in the perspective of the white haired man, he couldn\u2019t be more helpful.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The white haired man wanted to say more to Yulian, but the man in the center of the armored warriors started to shout.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe must be reinforcement from the Magic Tower. Quickly take care of him and then we will return with Hwai-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>At the man\u2019s command, the armored warriors who were standing by started to move toward Yulian and the white haired man.</p><br/><p>\u201cOowoo!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian shouted out loud as he started to swing his greatsword and prevented the armored warriors from approaching.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you last any longer?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Yulian asked the white haired man, the man nodded his head. He had been able to catch his breath thanks to Yulian.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian answered briefly before running into the group of armored warriors. Yulian\u2019s sword was one that shined even brighter when he was going up against a large amount of enemies.</p><br/><p>\u201cOowooo~!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian let out a unique shout as he started to swing his sword. The green sunlight flowed following Yulian\u2019s greatsword and started to send light in multiple directions.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe has amazing skills. The Black Brigade will not relax and make sure to suppress him properly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once the cape-wearing man, who seemed to be the leader of the armored warriors, stepped forward and shouted, the armored warriors gathered together and slowly started to push Yulian back.</p><br/><p>Yulian wanted to slash them all at once with the greatsword, but the armored warriors were pretty skilled as well.</p><br/><p>Their strength seemed to be on par with the Red Storm warriors.</p><br/><p>Yulian had swung his sword in multiple directions, but the number of fallen armored warriors were less than ten. Yulian was completely shocked.</p><br/><p>As he peeked toward the white haired man while fighting, the man seemed to be barely dodging the armored warriors swords and shields, while killing them off one by one.</p><br/><p>It seemed that his specialty was not a group battle but a sword art focused on one-on-one battles.</p><br/><p>Become a patron and get advanced chapters!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

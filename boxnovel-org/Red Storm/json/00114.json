It was a deal that everyone can be satisfied with.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo not put him too much into a corner.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is an experienced merchant. He will only accept a deal where he will not face a loss.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is true.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian stopped walking as he agreed with Runa\u2019s statement and continued to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know we do not have much time, but we do not need to be rushed. There are a lot of things to do, but I am young and you are also young. The Red Storm is young as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am only pushing it a little further than we can handle. There should not be any problems.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian nodded his head as he started to walk again.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you having fun?\u201d</p><br/><p>The kids who were having fun in the water were shocked to see Yulian approach them and ask them a question.</p><br/><p>But that was only for an instant. The three children quickly got out of the puddle and stood in a line in front of Yulian before bowing their heads.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe greet Yulian-nim, the Desert\u2019s Great Conqueror, the Eastern War God, the future undisputed War God of the Desert, and Pareia\u2019s Glow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian thought that these children, who seemed to not even be ten years old, greeting him so respectfully like this was very cute. Yulian and Runa were smiling without even realizing that they had started to smile.</p><br/><p>\u2018These are the children and the lives that I need to protect.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yulian recognized his responsibility once more as he kneeled down to make eye contact with the children.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt must have been difficult to memorize that long name.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, my father and mother told me that even if I do not memorize anything else, I needed to memorize that. They said it was the pride of Pareia.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing one of the children boldly answer, Yulian caressed the child\u2019s head as he answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, that is only a little correct.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>The child\u2019s eyes became extremely round.</p><br/><p>\u201cPareia\u2019s pride is your parents, and the warriors who are sweating over there while training themselves. This Glow is just one person who is with them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the children\u2019s eyes become extremely round, Yulian lifted all three children with his arm as he continued to speak to them.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd all of you, who will be warriors in the future, are Pareia\u2019s pride as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing what Yulian had to say, the children all started to smile like their lips were going to rip. It was the destiny of all male children to learn from an early age that they will grow up to be warriors; and they learned the way of a warrior from a very young age.</p><br/><p>But today, they met the warrior among warriors and even received some encouragement.</p><br/><p>Seeing the children smiling so widely, Yulian ended up putting a little too much strength into his arm while thinking they were so cute.</p><br/><p>\u201cOwwwww~!\u201d</p><br/><p>As one of the children suddenly shouted in pain, Yulian released the strength in his arm i shock and let them down.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen grow up strong to become Pareia\u2019s great warriors. That will be your pride.\u201d</p><br/><p>The children bowed once more to Yulian before running off to show off to their friends and parents. Yulian smiled once more after seeing them run off.</p><br/><p>Yulian was now 26 years old. Other men of similar age already had three of four children, but Yulian still did not have a child.</p><br/><p>Pere had a two year old son, and even Orca had recently had a cute daughter who was taking the attention of everyone in the family, but Grace showed no signs of being pregnant.</p><br/><p>Yulian really wanted a child, but he had started to be cautious after hearing Grace sigh while he was having too much fun with his niece and nephew.</p><br/><p>Yulian started to talk to Runa as if to calm his sad heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cRuna, shouldn\u2019t you get married as well? Since you are the Glow\u2019s assistant warrior at such a young age, the single ladies might want to make you their man.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMake me their man? Do not say something so scary, Glow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShould we make a bet to see how long you can last?\u201d</p><br/><p>Runa tilted his head at Yulian\u2019s question and responded.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by how long I can last?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUntil you are married.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have no thoughts right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian started to smile at Runa\u2019s uncompromising response.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you say we need to force warriors to have multiple wives?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease consider me to be the exception. I would prefer if you would consider that one hour of my time is like one day\u2019s worth for Pareia.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian smiled once more at Runa\u2019s uncompromising response.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is why I said let\u2019s make a bet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI do not bet on things I am not certain about. Furthermore, I am not lacking anything to fill by winning a bet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut who cares? You\u2019ll end up doing it anyways.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease be more clear, Glow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, nothing much. There should be five to six single ladies waiting for you when we get home.\u201d</p><br/><p>Runa was completely shocked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo not blame me. I may be Pareia\u2019s Glow, but Grace is the Glow of the Provoke family.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI suddenly have a stomachache. It\u2019s been hurting for a while, but I think I need to visit a priest today for treatment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian smiled at Runa\u2019s very visible lie and answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo not think about running away to a priest\u2019s house. One of the single ladies who are waiting for you is Tuma Takaka-nim\u2019s granddaughter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Runa turned stiff where he was standing and started to contemplate. Unfortunately, there was nowhere for him to go.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Yulian happily watched as Runa was being overwhelmed by Grace and the ladies inside the paoe.</p><br/><p>Seeing Runa, who was able to speak his mind in front of over 10,000 warriors, and even in front of the murderous aura of the Red Storm, suffering in front of the women was pretty sweet to see.</p><br/><p>\u201cHyung-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>While he was laughing, Yulian heard Pere calling for him and stepped outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease come with me for a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian thought of something based on Pere\u2019s words and quietly followed after him.</p><br/><p>Once they got far away from the paoe, Pere turned around and started to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey have failed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c......\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian let out a groan. However, he had expected as much.</p><br/><p>It was something he attempted even while knowing that the chances of failure was very high. To take the head of a diplomat of a strong nation like the Silence Empire was not something your average assassin could accomplish.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHonestly, I did not like this method. We sent the assassin because of our grief and sense of urgency, but it is best to take revenge with our own hands. Let\u2019s just wait 10 years. We just need to take the heads of those fancy nobles within that time. We will have 100,000 warriors in three years.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHyung-nim, you are right. A cheap revenge like that is not our style.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two brothers had hired an assassin to try and kill Janet, the diplomat of the Silence Empire.</p><br/><p>He was the reason their father and mother had died. He was the reason their tribe was almost broken into pieces.</p><br/><p>Yulian had wanted to get his revenge since he became Pareia\u2019s Glow, but in some aspects, getting revenge on Janet was even harder than getting revenge on Venersis. That was why they had hired an assassin.</p><br/><p>Pere had brought the results of it today.</p><br/><p>Yulian had not expected much, and hearing that the assassin had failed, Yulian thought that it really was important to take revenge with his own hands.</p><br/><p>Maybe his father had made the assassin fail because he wanted Yulian to do it with his own hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat. I was feeling iffy about it but I feel much better now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Become a patron and get advanced chapters!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

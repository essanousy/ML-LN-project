The construction in the desert was so tiring that if you did not get enough rest at night, it would impact your efficiency the next day.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Everybody had gone to sleep to prepare for the next day. \u00a0Other than the moonlight and couple bonfires nearby, there was no other light over the construction site. It was at this time that a group of people were stealthily approaching while avoiding the sharp gazes of the patrol warriors.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cWe need to instill as much fear as we can today. The security will get stronger and stronger as time goes by.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As the man in the lead warned the black-clad men behind him, they all nodded their heads instead of responding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cWe will separate here. I trust that you will all do a good job. Don\u2019t forget that Master has said we will be paid based on our merits. Losing to other brigades will hurt the pride of our Claw Brigade.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The black-clad men nodded their heads to say that was obvious. The mission consisted of four brigades attacking from the North, South, East, and West. And the Master said he will pay the brigades based on merit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The most skilled of these four brigades was this Claw brigade made of twenty A-grade Assassins. They had less members than the brigades attacking from the other three directions, however, in their world, fame was very important. Thanks to that, if they managed to achieve greater merit than the other brigades, some of the assassins from the other brigades may crawl over to join them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In addition, there was also the revenge of the Eastern Continent\u2019s greatest Assassin Guild the \u2018Black Knife\u2019 on the line with this mission. That was why the members of the Claw felt a sense of excitement as well.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the man\u2019s order, the assassins started to quietly enter the paoes where the workers resided.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It took them a while to completely sneak into the paoes as the patrol warriors were being very careful with their duty to the point that the assassins felt a sense of burden. But they were A-grade assassins. Unless someone was completely focused on protecting the paoe, it would be difficult to spot them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The assassins could finally start to complete their mission. The workers said goodbye to this world without letting out a peep thanks to the assassins\u2019 daggers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As they had been ambushing the workers, a loud noise of a drum started to echo around five minutes later.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Boom. Boom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Pareia\u2019s warriors jumped up out of their paoes and put on their gears. The sound of the drum signified that enemies have invaded. Many warriors gathered with the veteran and lead warriors in less than five minutes before directly heading over to the construction site.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cShit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The leader of the Claw started to curse. The brigade that attacked from the north was discovered even before they finished infiltrating the camp.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He felt like they would have been able to achieve more if the Claw was the only brigade to attempt this mission. He put a wooden flute the size of a fingernail into his mouth and let out a long noise.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Tweeeeeeeeeeeeet-</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was so low that it was almost impossible to hear, but for the trained assassins, this was like the sound of thunder.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of the members of the Claw stopped their actions and started to escape from the paoes. They needed to escape as quickly as possible as the patrol warriors were already heading in their direction.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They had been trained over and over before coming out here. They were trained to not treat the barbarians of the desert like the soldiers of the continent. They were also told to never think of taking on these warriors 1 on 1, even if they were A-grade assassins.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The sound of many assassins shouting out loud could be heard less than five minutes after the leader of the Claw blew his flute.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was an unbelievably fast response.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cYou damn trash who don\u2019t know how to fight fairly dare to\u2026\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Pere let out his anger as he rushed his pirma toward the escaping black-clad men and stabbed them to death.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Yes, Pere was the warrior in charge of the three thousand warriors residing at the construction site.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Pere had already heard from Runa, who had come together with Grace, to be very cautious.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Runa had told Pere about how Shubeon almost died from the assassins of the continent, as well as how Thrint killed the Master of the assassins. Runa warned that there may be retaliation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">That was why he had increased the number of patrol warriors as if they were at war, and trained them to respond quickly in case of an enemy attack. Even still,close to 100 workers were hit. Pere became extra angry at the fact that the damage could have been much worse if he had not prepared in advance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cKill them all. We already know who the enemy is and do not need to think about getting any prisoners. Just kill as many of them as fast as possible.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Pere shouted out loud as he ran amok left and right.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">One of the Claw\u2019s assassins looked toward Pere as he retreated. He could clearly tell that this barbarian was the leader of the warriors.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u2018If I kill that bastard, it will make it easier to move in the future. I will also gain a lot of fame.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The assassin thought like that as he lowered his body as much as possible and shielded his body with his camouflage cape.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With only the moonlight and some bonfires to light up the night, the assassin was almost impossible to see once he covered his body up like that.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It did not take long for the barbarian to approach the location. In fact, it was so fast that the assassin did not even have time to calm his breathing. However, for an A-grade assassin like himself, killing an enemy who was caught off guard because of the camouflage was like taking candy from a baby.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The assassin confidently kicked the ground and jumped up toward Pere and flung his dagger toward Pere\u2019s neck.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cHmph!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Pere shouted out in contempt as he blocked the flying dagger with his shamshir. He had debated catching it with his hand, but did not do so as he was warned about their daggers being coated in poison.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cDisappointing. You thought you could get me with something like this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Pere was someone who had an even sharper intuition than Yulian on a normal basis. Even without that intuition, there were less than five individuals in the entire desert who could trick Pere\u2019s eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Pere had so much strength that if his older brother Yulian was not there, Pere would have easily gotten the title of War God of the Eastern Desert. So for an assassin to camouflage himself and throw a dagger at Pere? That was not even funny.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The assassin gasped and tried to run away, but fell down in place without being able to move a single step. In his back was a sosoonta that was stabbed so deeply that you couldn\u2019t even see the blade anymore.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cDo not let a single one of them live.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Pere did not care whether the sosoonta he threw hit or missed the enemy. He started to shout again while riding through the site again.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

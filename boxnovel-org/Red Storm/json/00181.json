I have not agreed with your idea yet. Having a center to rally around and the fact that it will bring stability is great. However, it is still possible with our current system. You cannot change tradition overnight. It is also not a tradition that should be easily thrown away.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The person to state their opposition to Runa was actually Yulian himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cI am not saying we should be having the Glow become a king like in the continent with the chiefs serving as nobles or calling the warriors as knights. We can take our current titles and keep our desert\u2019s unique traditions alive. We can even share opinions in meeting of Greatest Warriors like we are doing right now. If there is anything that is changing, it is just stability regarding the Glow\u2019s bloodline. The only title that would really be changing is that we would be calling our tribe a nation.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cDo you mean that we will need to forever keep the Provoke family as the Glow?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At one of the chief\u2019s question, Runa nodded his head, as if to say that was obvious.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cYes. Please do not react negatively at the fact that the titles or system will change. Our Pareia is not just a small country fighting over a few oases anymore. We need to establish a system that fits our status as a nation, as well as create a base that can stand up against the continent.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Runa looked toward Yulian before continuing on.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cI am saying this because I believe that is the first step to reach the Glow\u2019s dream. The same dream that initially stirred my desire to serve you. I am talking about a strong nation that is self sufficient.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Silence filled the room once more. Everybody was looking around at one another. Originally, the selection of the Glow was determined by the recommendation of many of the chiefs. Of course it had become hereditary as long as the household of the Glow did not commit any critical mistakes or ended up dying.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, it was still different than having a king and letting the position be determined by the bloodline. They felt like it would make them miss out on potential future opportunities.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">You could see the conflicted expressions in everyone\u2019s eyes. If they could continue to have Glows like their current Glow, it would be possible to get all of them to agree. However, how could that be the case? If there are wise Glows, there are bound to be stupid Glows as well.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The current system allowed them to select a wise Glow while preventing a stupid person from becoming the Glow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There were a lot of things people wanted to say, but nobody dared to say any of their thoughts out loud. They did not want to be the ones to say it, because it would come out as if they were saying a stupid person will be born in the Provoke bloodline. Just as Runa just mentioned, if this hero named Yulian was to disappear, it basically meant the end of the current Pareia. That was how influencing Yulian was to Pareia right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cI understand what the Glow and may of the chief-nims are worried about. To say it one more time, what I am suggesting is being reborn as a nation. In order to be a nation, a lot of preparations are needed. That is why it is important that we have a strong Glow to control that, as well as making sure the education is in place for the Glow of the next generation.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Yarumaha responded on behalf of everyone as expected.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cWe understand what Assistant Warrior Runa is trying to do. There are many people who agree. However, it is just difficult for us to destroy a tradition that has continued for so long. Nobody knows what will happen in the future. There is nothing to complain about our current Glow. However, there is no way to know that it will be the same story with even his descendants.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Yarumaha looked back and forth between Yulian and Pere before continuing on.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cAs Assistant Warrior Runa mentioned, our Pareia is no longer a small tribe but a strong nation that has unified the Eastern Desert. This Yarumaha agrees with you that we need to stabilize our territory and develop a new system. However, and I apologize to the Glow for saying this, but we need to keep an escape route in case the worst possible scenario happens.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cWhat Yarumaha-nim says is correct. I have studied the history of the continent before, and some nations have something called a senate, where they can show their opposition for the King\u2019s suggestion if all of them agree. It might be good to have a similar system with our chiefs meeting together like a senate.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Runa sighed internally at Yulian\u2019s selfless words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u2018Without a strong system for succession of power, it will be difficult to create stability in a short amount of time. Even if it is difficult to get an unanimous vote to oppose the king, if there is the possibility for a king to be opposed, that can end up as a source of weakness.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Yulian seemed to know what Runa was thinking, as he looked toward Runa and asked with his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u2018What are you so worried about? Do I look that weak?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u2018The Glow is not weak, but \u2026\u2026\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Yulian may not have a problem, but it frustrated Runa as he thought about the next generation. Yulian may be the War God of the Eastern Desert, but he was a Glow that frequently was in the frontlines of war. The Glow was still human. A human who could end up dead by a stray arrow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If he falls, his child will need to take power. At that time, this system will definitely end up a weakness. Subordinates under a weak leader are bound to work together to antagonize the leader. That was what Runa was worried about.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u2018Amazing.

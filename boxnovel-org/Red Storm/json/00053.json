What do you mean by that? Glow Baguna has passed away and his first and second sons are responsible for it. Shouldn\u2019t that make it obvious that our Orca will succeed the position of Glow?</p><br/><p>Nurapa looked around at the other chiefs before speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the history of Pareia, we have never served a boy who has not even completed his coming-of-age ceremony as the Glow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOrca will be an adult next year so why it that such a big issue? You lot, are you trying to make it so Yulian or Pere can be the glow?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf those two really did murder the Glow, how could they be Pareia\u2019s Glow?\u201d</p><br/><p>Librie glared at Nurapa at his response.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat means that all of you still don\u2019t believe my side of the story.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is not it. We are trying to let you know that it is time for Pareia\u2019s Glow to move to a different family. We must decide on a new Glow at the gathering of the Chiefs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBlasphemy. You\u2019re against our Orca becoming the Glow because you are trying to take the position for yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nurapa looked around, as if to ask for help.</p><br/><p>Yarumaha of the Deep Deep Oasis started to speak, as if he understood Nurama\u2019s intentions.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is not what Nurapa is trying to say. If there is nobody in the Provoke family to take on the position of the Glow, it is only fitting for the chiefs to gather to determine a new Glow. As Nurapa mentioned, there has never been a case where a boy who has not had their coming-of-age ceremony has taken the position of Glow. Librie-nim, as you mentioned, we can wait until Orca-nim completes his coming-of-age ceremony next year, however, what kind of traits does Orca-nim show that says he will make an outstanding Glow?\u201d</p><br/><p>Librie started to get nervous seeing that Yarumaha, the most revered chief, agreed with Nurapa\u2019s suggestion.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t it. She needed Orca to take the position of Glow and start building up his power base so that they could fend off Yulian and Pere\u2019s attempt at retribution.</p><br/><p>Because of her nervousness and anxiousness, Librie ended up saying something that ended up making the Desert warriors angry.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur Orca has earned the trust of the Silence Empire. If that boy becomes the Glow, we can receive the protection of the Silence Empire. When that happens, we won\u2019t need to worry about something like the Shuarei anymore, so our Orca must become the Glow.\u201d</p><br/><p>All of the chiefs instantly frowned after hearing what Librie had to say, and even Janet, who had been quietly sitting in the back started to frown as well.</p><br/><p>\u2018This useless woman can\u2019t even eat the feast that I\u2019ve prepared for her. Did sje think they would be jumping up in joy if she mentions us? I really can\u2019t understand this woman.\u2019</p><br/><p>That\u2019s what Janet thought about Librie\u2019s speech, and he also started to think that it would be hard to set a puppet Glow here in Pareia. However, it shouldn\u2019t be a big issue.</p><br/><p>He managed to get rid of Yulian and Pere, who would have been a thorn in their side, and with all of Pareia shaking like this, he could regain the things that he thought he was going to lose. None of the chiefs will be able to go against their requests.</p><br/><p>\u2018All we have to do is sit back and watch before returning with the things we want. If we are lucky, we will also be able to set up a puppet Glow as well.\u2019</p><br/><p>Internally, Janet had a devious smile, and he decided to just quietly watch how the situation goes.</p><br/><p>Sanatu, who had the worst temper of all of the chiefs that have gathered, started to shout at Librie.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince when have we decided on Pareia\u2019s Glow with Silence\u2019s permission! Since when did our warriors of Pareia feared going to war with the Shuarei?\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking past at whether their temper was good or bad, Librie had left a large scar on their pride. That was why all of the chiefs were glaring at Librie.</p><br/><p>The shocked Librie urgently looked towards her father Duripue and Janet for help, but Janet just shook his head while Duripue was regretting the actions he took while being manipulated by this terrible daughter of his. (TL: His name is different than in the manhwa)</p><br/><p>However, he could not just sit back and watch.</p><br/><p>Duripue got up from his seat and started to calm the angry chiefs down.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that is not what she meant. The news about Glow Baguna\u2019s passing has surely spread throughout the desert. I\u2019m sure there will be a tribe drooling at taking our Pareia\u2019s lands, and the Shuarei will also not sit still.\u201d</p><br/><p>The mumbling in the paoe quieted down after hearing Duripue\u2019s words. That was the thing they had to pay the most attention to right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s first return to our individual oasis and prepare out defenses. We will leave the work of the Glow to Librie-nim for now. Not because she is my daughter, but because Librie-nim has the command according to the rule of the Desert. Nobody has any complaints right? Once everything has settled down, the chiefs can gather together to decide on a new Glow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because what Duripue has said was true, the other chiefs agreed and started to exit the paoe chatting with the people they were close with.</p><br/><p>Once everybody left, Duripue started to speak to Librie.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou made a mistake.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did I do?\u201d</p><br/><p>At Librie\u2019s retort, Duripue sighed internally before shaking his head.</p><br/><p>It was certain that she made a grave mistake. However, it was already spilled water. Duripue just had to convince his daughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you plan on doing by touching their pride? You need their support in order for Orca to become the Glow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, even you heard what they were saying.\u201d</p><br/><p>Duripue let out a sigh before starting to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh~ It may be temporary, but currently, you are Pareia\u2019s Glow. Speak your mind but go with their plan for the time being. You need to stall for time. Orca just needs one year to finish his coming-of-age ceremony. You can start trying to convince them at that point. We need to highlight Orca\u2019s abilities and earn him some merits he currently does not have, so that there won\u2019t be any issues of him becoming the Glow. We need to make sure there won\u2019t be any issues even if Yulian or Pere try to cause any issues in the future. Do you understand what I am saying?\u201d</p><br/><p>After listening, Librie felt that what Duripue had said was right and nodded her head.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, as they were heading out of the paoe, Sanatu started to speak to Yarumaha in a grumpy voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cHonestly, I cannot believe Librie-nim\u2019s words. Yarumaha-nim, you were there at that time too. You were there when Yulian-nim convinced us with his extremely passionate speech. But for him to murder Glow Baguna and cause a rebellion on that same day? Logically, no, even if you consider Yulian-nim to be abnormal, does that make any sense?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yarumaha just silently shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop just shaking your head and say something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat would an old man like me have to offer?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say things like that. I\u2019m sure you know just how much everybody is focusing on your words now that Glow Baguna has left this world. I believe there is a high chance that you will become the Glow if the chiefs get to decide on the new Glow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yarumaha shook his head again at Sanatu\u2019s words and started to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou cannot select me. I am too old to be the Glow and none of my children have the aptitude to be the Glow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen are you just going to sit back and watch?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have many thoughts going on as well. However, if we start getting on each other\u2019s bad sides because of the Glow selection, we will be eaten up by the Shuarei and that devious Silence. That is why I am holding back.\u201d</p><br/><p>At Yarumaha\u2019s words, Sanatu, as well as the other nearby chiefs all admired his wisdom.</p><br/><p>He definitely saw things differently than they did.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what do you plan to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, we must prepare our defenses. There is no way the Shuarei will let go of this opportunity. The Wikaly tribe to the north has been aiming for us as well. Tell the warriors to not let down their guards. The Young Glow brothers are not dead yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone looked at each other after his meaningful words. They couldn\u2019t tell the reason this wise old man said the last thing that he did. Yarumaha looked around at the chiefs looking at him with blank expressions before speaking again.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you just standing around? Prepare to return to your individual oasis as soon as possible. Don\u2019t forget what I just said as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>After that, he headed towards his paoe. As he was leaving, the remaining chiefs stared at Yarumaha\u2019s back before hurriedly heading back to prepare to head back to their individual oasis.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

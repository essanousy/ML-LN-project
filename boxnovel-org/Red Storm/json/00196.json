The Henkel Gate was placed on top of that path.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Henkel Gate added on to the natural protections of the Henkel Mountain range, with tall cliffs and mountains on both sides of the single path, making it impossible to cross the Henkel Plains without going through this single path. That was why the Henkel Gate was called a natural fortress, even with the manual construction of the gate itself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There was only a single door into the gate. If they could pierce through that one door, they would get the opportunity to perfectly capture something that Pareia has longed to have for such a long time. They would be able to have a region of their own that could grow food.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u2018It is fitting of its name as a natural fortress. WIthout taking control of that gate, we will need to constantly be on guard about the Silence Empire invading us in this side of the plains. In addition, with us not being able to do anything to the enemy who is right in front of us, this would end up a useless region.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Runa thought about that as he slowly stepped forward. He wanted to take a closer look.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cRuna-nim, it is dangerous if you go any further.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Runa stopped his movement as one of the guard warriors cautioned him. This path with mountains and cliffs decorating the side and the gate cutting off the only path across really was a path of victory for the defenders, and a path of despair for the attackers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The arrows from the fortress reached all the way to the beginning area of that path of despair, and the path was pretty narrow that less than ten battering rams or siege weapons could make it through. Furthermore, that path became even more narrow as you continued forward to the point that it was impossible to properly attack the castle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It also did not help that the gate was completely made of steel, making it difficult to tell how long they would need to ram at the door for it to break.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Runa continued to think.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u2018Even if we use Orca-nim\u2019s magic to break the castle wall next to the gate instead, it would still be impossible to evade the rain of arrows that can cover the sky completely back. No, even if the castle gate is destroyed, how many of our warriors can really make it through at once \u2026\u2026\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The warriors could charge forward putting their lives on the line, but the pile of corpses will start to grow quickly, and even if the others climbed over the corpses to continue moving forward, it would quickly become a mountain of corpses. That damn gate was configured that way.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Runa naturally turned his gaze toward the mountains and cliffs on either side. He then slowly shook his head. That was impossible. Even if a small team somehow managed to successfully climb it, \u00a0the gate had wickedly build watchtowers around the mountain ranges in the off chance that they managed to find a path up the cliffs. This prevented them from even considering climbing the cliffs.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The defense of Henkel Gate was pretty much perfect. With that being the case, there really was not anything Runa could do.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He even wanted to cry to the heavens and ask how such a rough mountain range that is difficult for people to cross could exist in the middle of a plain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Their only choice was to wait for the enemy to give up the gate and come out to battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">But what kind of idiotic commander would give up the gate that guarantees their victory and come out to fight?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">But even if they were confident in their own abilities and came out, as long as they left about 5,000 soldiers to protect the gate, it would be almost impossible to break through it even with 100,000 warriors.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u2018Who knows, maybe they don\u2019t have enough arrows or rocks \u2026\u2026\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Runa thought about that before starting to laugh. Their enemy was extremely prepared to the point that they built watchtowers in the mountains, so how would they forget to prepare such basic necessities as arrows or rocks? It was a laugh to scoff at himself for even considering that might happen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They had the Glow whose martial arts transcended everyone\u2019s imaginations, as well as a strong group of warriors called the Red Storm. They even had tens of thousands of warriors who were stronger than the soldiers of the continent. Finally, they had him, someone that even the Glow, who was the overall commander, trusted with all of his heart. But for them to face a battle they could still not win.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u2018No!

The war between these two powerhouses drew in all of the nations of the Eastern continent.

Nobody had expected this desert tribe to completely pressure the Silence Empire. But after seeing it happen, they had to believe it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">For example, Master Spotch, one of the strongest cards of the Silence Empire, was not sent to battle with the Rojini Kingdom.

In their point of view, the fact that they lost this region to us is a shock in itself. If they leave it like this, the morale of their soldiers will take a hit. That is why I am certain that they will make a move. We cannot be careless.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cThat is why I felt like we should be raising the warriors\u2019 morales even more.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cWe would do that if this was the desert, but this is still a foreign land for us. Their morale may go up, but they will lower their guards. It will not be too late to celebrate after we take our goal of the Henkel Plains. The Henkel Plains is right in front of us, Glow.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cYou are right, but \u2026\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Yulian knew what Runa was saying was right, but he was feeling iffy about it because he knew what the warriors liked and enjoyed the most.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cOur first priority is to defend against the Empire\u2019s attack that will come. We need to strengthen the defenses around the Fedore region and make sure we do not lose the trust of the people living here. Thankfully, Count Terros who was the lord of this region does not seem to have been an outstanding lord. At least that is what I think since all of the citizens are so quiet since we took over.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cAccording to Edwin, other than the Rojini Kingdom and a few other smaller kingdoms, the rest of the nations have a significant wealth gap between the general population and the nobility.

They probably did that to give the soldiers the joys of victory and keep their morale up, but Pareia\u2019s warriors did not act like that in the first place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">For the warriors, war was a necessary even for the protection of the tribe, not to fill their own personal greed. In addition, the lead warriors had already reminded them multiple times to stay in their respective areas, so they shouldn\u2019t lose the trust of the people in the Fedore region because of that.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be bad to pick a representative of each village and speak with them.

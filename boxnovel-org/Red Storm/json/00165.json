It is also a monster that is difficult for people to see. It is because they sit at the top of the food pyramid.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">And a Giant Sand Dragon is even larger. Even if you looked throughout the desert, there were probably less than five of them. Of course this meant that the number of people that have seen there were extremely rare.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">That large body and loud roar that easily made people shiver was enough to make people freeze in fear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Especially when they were in the quicksand river with nowhere to run, this would be much much worse.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cWhy are you getting scared? Is this your first time seeing that giant blob?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It seems the united tribe was not the only ones to be affected by the roar. It was scary enough to make even the warriors on the Desert Runner plop down in fear. Their eyes may be used to Shopping, but their ears were not. The moment they heard the roar of a Giant Sand Dragon that would make all monsters in the desert shiver, it was like a magic was placed on their legs so that they had no strength.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thriger flinched a bit as well, but he kept his cool and shouted at the warriors with a loud voice to get their heads back in the game.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Since Pareia was affected this much, the united tribe\u2019s warriors were in a state of complete chaos. In fact, there were even some warriors who voluntarily jumped into the quicksand river.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There were some that managed to luckily escape the no-wind zone, but they had no choice but to choose to head back into it. The monsters that were peeking their heads out around there were definitely Sand Dragons.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They could hear roars from multiple directions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thriger had coordinated this plan himself, but this overwhelming fear made him regret not making the enemy surrender with their own hands.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">But once the united tribe\u2019s Greatest Warriors started to shout out in a loud voice the lead warriors started to come back to their senses, and the more courageous warriors of the united tribe started to grab their bows. This was the strong mental fortitude that only the desert warriors possessed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">But with their boats moving as it pleased, the arrows they shot toward Shopping and the Sand Dragons did not even get close to them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Yulian had no plans on allowing Shopping or the Sand Dragons to eat the people. Although many of the enemy will end up falling into the quicksand river because of Shopping, eating them was a different issue. He would not allow such a sight as a fellow human. It was also because he was thinking about the future.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The short-term gain would be Shopping and the Sand Dragons swallowing up a couple of people, but Yulian had to avoid this at all cost. He was planning on making all of them their prisoners and turning them into Pareia\u2019s warriors.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Wouldn\u2019t it be obvious that people would not like him as much if they think about how their Glow let a monster eat people as they pleased?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Yulian wanted to be remembered as a more humane person. He wanted to be like his father, Baguna, the Benevolent Eye.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Yulian took out his greatsword. The sunlight reflected off of it to send a glaring light. He then started to shout loudly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cListen. I am the Glow of Pareia, Yulian Provoke. Swear your surrender and I shall let you live.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The warriors of the united tribe could not believe that Pareia\u2019s Glow was casually standing on top of that scary monster. Shopping then started to push through the boats. The Sand Dragon was the fastest monster in the quicksand river. Even if they shot their arrows, it would only be headed toward a fellow warrior, so they could not even shoot their arrows at him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Boom. Boom. Boom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Well, it wasn\u2019t really that loud of a noise. But they could start to hear a terrifying noise as Shopping crashed against and flipped over any and every boat in his way. They only heard short bursts of screams before the sounds completely disappeared. Nothing could be heard once you were sucked into the quicksand river.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cThe Greatest Warriors of the united tribe. Is this the result you want? Do not be fools. Give the order to your warriors.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Yulian stopped Shopping in front of the united tribe\u2019s Greatest Warriors and looked down from above as he shouted at them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The warriors of the united tribe all turned toward their Greatest Warrior. It was a warrior\u2019s mission to put their tribe before their lives. But if they managed to avoid death because their Greatest Warrior surrendered, that would not be them throwing away their warrior\u2019s mission.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The warriors of the desert were completely faithful to their order.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Greatest Warrior of the united tribe looked toward Yulian with disbelief. He could not even imagine something like a Giant Sand Dragon Rider, but he was seeing it with his own two eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He then looked toward the warriors of the united tribe. They were all looking at him. If he did not surrender, they would not beg for their lives. But what purpose is there for these 20,000 warriors to sink into the quicksand river?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At that moment, one of the Sand Dragons could not hold back and picked up a couple of people into his mouth. He must not have been able to hold on because he was hungry in a place full of people.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cYou bastard!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As everyone was looking at the Sand Dragon in shock, Yulian angrily stomped his foot.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Grraaaaaaaaaaaaar~!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Shopping shouted out in pain and started to twist his body. It was the first time he felt this kind of intense pain in a long time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Shopping felt his owner\u2019s anger with his body and looked toward the Sand Dragon that caused him to feel this pain with angry eyes. He seemed to be saying \u2018I warned you not to do it!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Shopping was not very patient, and the owner on top of him did not show any signs of stopping him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Shopping instantly bit down on the neck of the Sand Dragon that was trying to run away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Squeal squeal~!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Sand Dragon failed around trying to escape, but he could not fight off Shopping\u2019s strong jaw strength. It took less than a few seconds for a Sand Dragon, one of the strongest monsters in the Desert, to die.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The body of the Sand Dragon that swallowed two people instantly fell into the quicksand river and disappeared. This instilled fear in both the people who saw what happened, as well as the other Sand Dragons that were gathered by Shopping\u2019s calling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As Yulian reached a level that he could not see without raising his head up, the Greatest Warrior of the united tribe could not think about anything else. They had completely been defeated and they needed to surrender if they accepted their defeat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cEverybody, drop your weapons.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The warriors of the united tribe put their pretty useless weapons down on the bottom of the boat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At this moment, the 20,000 warriors and 5,000ish small boats that the united tribe and the Silence Empire ambitiously and secretly prepared had easily come into Pareia\u2019s hands.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">End of chapter.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Next up:</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Charge</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">I will win again today.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

Even Venersis\u2019 quick action could not prevent the dagger from stabbing her heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy tribe \u2026 and my son \u2026 will follow the rules of the desert and make sure to get rid of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mairez looked at Venersis with eyes full of grudge, and Venersis felt like every place her eyes landed on hurt more than when he was slashed by a shamshir.</p><br/><p>As Mairez\u2019s body started to grow cold in his arms, Venersis just blankly stood in place.</p><br/><p>Now, he could no longer get rid of the stigma that Venersis, the \u2018Bloodied Hands\u2019 murdered the Mother of Pareia. He could not make any kind of excuse. His name and his pride had both received a large scar.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Venersis looked down at Mairez with a blank expression before letting out a loud moan. He then carefully laid her down in the paoe and walked out.</p><br/><p>A long time later, the large box that was in the corner of the paoe started to move around.</p><br/><p>Thunk.</p><br/><p>The lid of the box made a noise as it flipped open, and a young boy came jumping out of it.</p><br/><p>His eyes that were open extremely wide looked to be very shocked.</p><br/><p>Although he had opened the box just slightly to make sure nobody was around before opening the lid, the shock in the heart of the child had not subsided.</p><br/><p>The next moment, the child\u2019s eyes grew so wide they looked like they might rip. The black pupils in his eyes grew large before suddenly shrinking.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother.\u201d</p><br/><p>The boy who looked to be around ten years old had seen Mairez\u2019s body. The boy urgently called to her as he ran towards her.</p><br/><p>Yulian Provoke.</p><br/><p>The first son of the Glow of the Pareia tribe, Mairez\u2019s one and only son Yulian, could no longer speak after seeing the bloody chest of his mother and just kneeled down next to her.</p><br/><p>\u2018Mother\u2026..\u2019</p><br/><p>Tears started to fall from Yulian\u2019s eyes. He put a hand over his mouth to muffle his cry and hugged his mother\u2019s body.</p><br/><p></p><ul style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt\"><br/><p></p><li style=\"list-style-type: disc;font-size: 11pt;font-family: Arial;color: #000000;background-color: transparent;font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">You are foremost a prince, the Glow who will lead out tribe forward in the future, and a warrior who will lead the tribe. However, since you are not an adult yet, you do not have the mission nor authority to protect the tribe just yet. So go in here. If you end up as prisoner, it will not be good for Pareia.</li><br/><p></p></ul><br/><p>Knowing that Venersis\u2019s attack had started outside, Mairez tried to hide her son, but Yulian was stubbornly not listening. He was a male and a son, so he felt that he should protect his mother, who was a woman.</p><br/><p>What Mairez had said to convince her son after feeling proud seeing the small practice shamshir in her son\u2019s hand, ended up being the last words Yulian ever heard coming out of his mother\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>With his hands and face completely covered in blood, Yulian laid on his mother\u2019s chest and cried quietly. He needed to keep his mother\u2019s wish.</p><br/><p>Although he was very young at 10 years old, he knew exactly what he had to do. If he cried loudly right now, he would simply end up a prisoner. The cost to get him back would be quite heavy as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother, I will not be sad. I will only cry this one time. Mother, I \u2026 this son of yours will make sure to return this grudge...I will follow the law of the desert and return it in the exact same way \u2026 so I will not be sad.\u201d</p><br/><p>A boy\u2019s promise.</p><br/><p>The child of Baguna, the Glow of Pareia, and Mairez, the Mother of Pareia.</p><br/><p>While Yulian Provoke was making this promise, outside, the dry desert sand and the dust of the wilderness had absorbed a lot of human blood. It then combined with the wind that you often see in the desert wilderness.</p><br/><p>A red wind befitting the name Red Desert started to blow.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

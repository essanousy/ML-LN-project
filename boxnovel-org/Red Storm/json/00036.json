Thirty knights were being warned by one desert warrior. However, with Yulian\u2019s next move, they confirmed that he had the abilities to back up his warning.</p><br/><p>They saw a faint haze starting to rise from Yulian\u2019s greatsword. They were able to see it even when the moon and the bonfires were the only sources of light lighting up the night.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is not possible\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Sesuna, as well as many of the knights were all muttering that quietly. From the beginning, it seemed impossible for him to be able to swing those large greatswords. Those swords were difficult to swing even with both hands, but using one in each hand? How was that possible? Plus, the extremely destructive power he showed\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>If that wasn\u2019t enough, now he was pouring mana into the greatsword. This was something only a master was able to do.</p><br/><p>\u2018I know of one two-handed sword master, however, a knight \u2026\u2026 no, a master who uses two of them \u2026...I\u2019ve never heard of such a thing.\u2019</p><br/><p>Sesuna was calmly assessing the situation. Currently there were five Royal Knights here in the desert. If they were to have a battle for their lives, even if it was against a master, they should be able to defend. After all, the Royal Knights of the Silence Empire were only one level, or maximum two levels under the masters\u2019 levels in comparison.</p><br/><p>Plus, they also had over twenty veteran knights. If they were to fight, they probably would not lose. However, the ones who will end up spilling blood will be the knights, and they would not be able to protect the prince either. There was nothing you could do if a master set their target on a specific person and only headed towards them.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve warned you.\u201d</p><br/><p>With those short words, Yulian started to run towards Shareulo.</p><br/><p>\u201cBlock him!\u201d</p><br/><p>No matter how moronic this prince was, and even if the enemy was a master, the Royal Knights, and really, all knights, had to protect the royal family and could not retreat. Once Sesuna\u2019s orders came out, all the knights blocked Yulian\u2019s path.</p><br/><p>In return, just as he had warned them, Yulian ruthlessly attacked the knights.</p><br/><p>Clank! Slash Clank!</p><br/><p>As steel hit steel, the loud noises of their weapons clashing echoed in the desert. The moans soon followed after that.</p><br/><p>With one swing, the knights on both the left and the right were pushed away and Yulian continued to move forward. They could not block him. After that, two more knights were pushed away and finally, when the Royal Knights were blocking Yulian, Yulian\u2019s greatsword started to change.</p><br/><p>The knights\u2019 swords were being cut into two and their full chainmail made of durable iron was being crushed or ripped apart. It was a sight you would not believe unless you saw it for yourself.</p><br/><p>Seeing that, Shareulo started to yell again.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat! What the heck are you doing?! Block that punk right now! Call the soldiers! Kill that punk this instant!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian smirked and showed some sympathy that these magnificent knights had to serve such a prince, but the knights were too busy focusing on Yulian\u2019s swords that nobody heard what he said. It may have been better that they did not hear him. Those type of words would only make them lose their strength.</p><br/><p>It took less than ten minutes for all the knights to be flung backwards. None of them had any severe injuries that would impact their lives. Yulian\u2019s anger had moved onto Shareulo, and he knew they had to follow orders.</p><br/><p>Even though all of his knights were knocked down, Shareulo continued to arrogantly yell towards Yulian.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow dare you lay your hands on the knights of the Silence Empire even after knowing who I am! Once I return, I will make sure to torture you to death, however, if you admit your wrongdoing and beg me for forgiveness, I will pretend that none of this happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian could not believe what Shareulo was saying. If he\u2019s able to shout like this even in this type of situation, what would have happened if he was not strong enough and had been caught by the knights?</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think you will be able to return to your Empire?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shareulo\u2019s face turned pale and traces of fear started to develop on his face at Yulian\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 you would dare to do something to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I? You insulted my country, you insulted our warriors, and now, you even dared to try to assault my wife. Why should I not kill you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shareulo\u2019s entire body started to shake at the thick murderous aura.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can try to attack me too. Pareia\u2019s warriors do not kill a person who does not have a weapon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian picked up one of the swords that a knight had dropped and handed it to Shareulo. Shareulo was not able to receive the sword and started to speak in a shaking voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you kill me \u2026 don\u2019t you know what would happen if you kill me? Fi...fine\u2026\u2026 I\u2019ll\u2026 pretend that none of this happened. We will return now. I promise I will not seek revenge\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018This truly is one of Silence Empire\u2019s princes?\u2019</p><br/><p>Seeing that Shareulo\u2019s shameless behavior made his anger appear to be too much, Yulian debated stopping right there. However, he knew that he could not stop here as the people of Pareia were watching. If he was to just back away now, it\u2019ll plant a seed in their hearts that no matter how strong you were, you had to walk on eggshells around the strong forces of the continent.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, to back away when it was the wife of the Young Glow who was assaulted, that would cause a large wound on the pride of the Pareian people.</p><br/><p>Yulian lifted his hand as he headed directly towards Shareulo and started to slap him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis one is punishment for looking down on our Pareia.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shareulo\u2019s left cheek became swollen in an instant.</p><br/><p>\u201cAck!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shareulo did not consider his reputation and shouted like he was about to die. As he started to rub his left cheek with both hands, Yulian\u2019s large hand slapped Shareulo\u2019s right cheek.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat one is punishment for looking down on our warriors.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shareulo was now down rolling on the ground while rubbing both of his cheeks and screaming at the top of his lungs. Watching this, the people of Pareia felt good while thinking that he was getting what he deserved.</p><br/><p>As Yulian looked over at Grace and started to head towards Shareulo, Grace quickly came up to Yulian and held his arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou do not need to punish him on my behalf. I am content he has received this much punishment.\u201d</p><br/><p>At Grace\u2019s request, Yulian looked around to read the expression of the tribe members. After seeing their satisfied faces, he thought that this was enough. Plus, seeing Shareulo suffering on the ground rubbing his whole body, he thought that there would be no point to continue.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease stop the fight.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, there was someone shouting while running towards them. It was the diplomat from the Silence Empire, Janet. Janet was surprised after seeing the knights and prince on the ground and started to shout at Yulian.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Glow, what is the meaning of this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian coldly responded.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about you explain to me what the meaning of this is? Your prince was insulting Pareia earlier and now tried to assault my wife. Well?\u201d</p><br/><p>At Yulian\u2019s answer, Janet\u2019s body swung as if the back of his head was hit by a hammer. In the end, that moron could not hold in his lecherous ways and caused an incident. Shareulo\u2019s lust was famous even back in the Empire.</p><br/><p>After seeing the woman standing next to Yulian, he could imagine Shareulo\u2019s actions without having seen it for himself. However, he could not just let it be when the prince was in such a condition.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter what may have happened, to insult the Empire\u2019s prince like this, don\u2019t you know this will gravely impact the relationship between the great Silence Empire and the Pareia tribe?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen are you telling me that I have to just sit by and watch my wife get raped? How should I watch it? Should I be laughing as I watch it for the friendship between the Empire and our tribe? If you come as an envoy of a nation, then you should not have acted this way! Don\u2019t you agree?\u201d</p><br/><p>At Yulian\u2019s reprimand, Janet had nothing to say.</p><br/><p>\u2018What shall I do about this?\u2019</p><br/><p>Janet once again cursed the crown prince who ordered him to travel with that moron, and could only worry about how to resolve this situation.</p><br/><p>As the other members of the envoy carried prince Shareulo and the knights into their residence, Grace quietly pulled Yulian\u2019s arm.</p><br/><p>Once Yulian followed Grace into the paoe, Grace put herself in Yulian\u2019s embrace and spoke as she stroked his chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know you are angry, but this incident will have some severe consequences. There should have been other ways to resolve it\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI held back not once, not twice, but three times. What else could i have done?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have to hold back because you are the Glow. If not three times, then four times, five times, even one hundred times if you can do so.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you scolding me right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Yulian was starting to get angry at Grace\u2019s words, Grace hugged Yulian tightly and started to rub his back as she answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not. I was extremely happy at your actions. How could I scold you when my husband cares so much about me. That\u2019s preposterous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why are you keep saying things like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think I felt that it was unfair? I had to hold back when that was happening to me. However, if it is for you to become a great Glow, I can hold back even thousands of times. Can you not understand my heart?\u201d</p><br/><p>As tears started to form in Grace\u2019s eyes, Yulian let out a sigh as he started to hold her tightly as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh~. How could I not know how you are feeling? However, this situation was just too much. How dare he put his hands on you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grace lightly smiled on the inside, however, tears were still hanging on her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cStill, I hope that you can restrain yourself in the future. Since you showed your might this time, the knights of the Silence Empire who now know of your strength will definitely not leave you alone. It\u2019s not even about hurting their pride, it is because they now know you are a dangerous presence. That is why I have told you all this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand. I will be careful from here on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou promise?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d</p><br/><p>At Yulian\u2019s answer, Grace got on her tippy-toes and kissed Yulian\u2019s cheek.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m relieved.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian could never win against Grace.</p><br/><p>(TL Note: Friends, my fellow Red Storm warriors, with this release, I have now been translating for 12 weeks and 36 releases have come out including this one. We have 1 more release before starting the last chapter of Volume 1. After finishing Volume 1, I will take 1 week off before coming back to translate Volume 2.

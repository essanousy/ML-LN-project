This little warrior looking up to my senior warriors\u2019 souls here today is named Yulian Provoke, a strong warrior hoping to follow in the footsteps of my seniors. A warrior who has the desire to conquer the desert and have everyone live together as a single tribe just like in the past. This little warrior who has the name of the Desert Conqueror will receive the will of the great heroes before me and make a vow that my will will not waver even if I am standing in the middle of a Sand Storm.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Yulian continued to shout out loud and his booming voice gathered the Red Storm and the Shireans.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The charisma and dreams that managed to convince the many oasis chiefs and chieftains at the young age of twenty started to show themselves once more. Seeing Yulian\u2019s confident appearance made everyone become absorbed by his speech and even the Hero\u2019s Land started to react to Yulian\u2019s booming proclamations.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The smell of blood started to disappear and the purple lines had become completely transparent, no longer visible to the naked eye. At that moment, tiem completely stopped.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">- Come to us.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Was he hearing things? Yulian did not even realize that he was slowly starting to walk toward the Hero\u2019s Land.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">- The one who wishes to see our will. Come to us.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">His surroundings instantly changed. He was not on a battlefield. Everything in front of his eyes was currently burning, and the area was full of the smell of blood and the smell of the warriors\u2019 sweat. There were many warriors who looked strong enough to easily destroy him working hard to slash against something.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He could not hear any shrieks, but there was definitely something being defeated by them, and there were times some of the warriors were even pushed back. But the warriors next to them would quickly help them to recover and instantly return to defeating the invisible existence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">- Welcome warrior who has revealed his will on his own.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As soon as he heard that voice, all of those strong warriors started to turn their gazes toward him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">- Your will and cheer has become a source of great strength for us. We were wondering what was going on as we were unable to receive any strength from our descendants for the past half month.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The person speaking in front of Yulian with a burning shamshir in his hand was the Great and Mighty Warrior Venekan, the Glow of the now forgotten united desert tribe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The overwhelming pressure Venekan gave off was welcomed by Yulian. He could feel himself start to get excited.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">- The Shire is the ones with the most righteous will out of all of our descendants. I was worried about their silence but now I know it was because of the arrival of the savior.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Yulian did not dare to respond. He was like an ant compared to them. How would an ant like himself dare to respond to Mount Tai? But he could tell. The Shire was singing the warriors\u2019 song and continuously maintaining their incantations to lower the burden on these warriors.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">- Your strong will has given us great strength. The name of this place is Valhalla, the Hero\u2019s Land. The Land of the End. It is the location countless numbers of heroes from all over the world have gathered to prepare for the final battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The scenery changed once more. Yulian could now see hundreds, no thousands of strong individuals. Venekan had shown it to him as the heroes had accepted him as one of them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was not just warriors from the desert. There were even knights from the continent wearing their armors and wielding their swords, as well as magicians carrying their staffs and wands. There were even people whose white hands were shining.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There were old people and young people, men and women, and even some who were not human. The important thing gathering all of them together was the fact that they were strong heroes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">- Another savior has been born in front of our eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cWhat \u2026 do i have to do?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As Yulian stumbled over his words and asked, Venekan reached the burning shamshir out to Yulian as he answered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">- You are already a warrior. Do as you wish. A warrior must use their will to overcome all obstacles. As you wish, in your own method. Just show us your actions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cAs I wish?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">- You are already a warrior we have accepted. Your will alone has already made you the savior. Take this shamshir.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The moment Yulian cautiously accepted the burning shamshir, an intense heat filled his entire body. This pain that felt like he was burning hurt so much that he would end up fainting if he let his guard down even for an instant. But Yulian did not faint and just clenched his teeth to keep his eyes open.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">- This is a small gift from us to you. We hope you can become a great warrior.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Yulian continuously used his ki to divide up the immense amount of strength that was flowing into his body. The strength used Yulian\u2019s veins to flow through his body before becoming completely absorbed in his blood and dantian.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He could feel his consciousness fading. He had no thoughts, no feelings, and even felt like he himself did not exist. Yulian realized this was the \u2018State of Nothingness\u2019 that his master had mentioned and let the power take over his body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He did not know how much time had passed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">By the time he was able to divide up the power and absorb all of it, Yulian had changed. It felt like everything that was clogged was now suddenly free and he could feel a level of strength that he had never felt before flowing through his body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Once he realized that he had changed, Venekan started to speak.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">- For so many saviors to be born in one generation and for two to be born in the desert alone is definitely a sign of troubled times. Before trying to decide who is right and who is wrong, just focus on what you personally believe to be justice. That is the will of the savior.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Yulian had to ask a question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cAm I doing the right thing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">- I am not a god. I am in this battle not because of who is right and wrong, but because it is my will. You should do the same thing. If you believe that what you are currently doing is right, push forward. But if you think that it is wrong, stop and turn around to reflect.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">No matter how noble the cause may be, many people will die in war. Yulian was certain that this sacrifice will lead to saving more lives in the future, but killing even a single person was not a good thing. It was because even the enemy stepped forward into war because of their own mission and responsibilities.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Killing such people would not be easy even if Yulian had an Iron Will. Yulian started to change once more at this point.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">War itself was a fight between two different perspectives on justice and two different wills.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cI hope to become a hero and step foot on this land once more.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Yulian\u2019s eyes started to glow to the point that the best way to describe it would be that there were beams of light coming out of his eyes. Venekan sent Yulian a warriors smile as he watched Yulian\u2019s eyes glow like that.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">- We would welcome that although it also means that the final battle is near. But it is not time yet so let us speak once more once your life is over. Return for now. Many people are waiting for you right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Venekan sent Yulian away with a slight gesture just as he had done so to call Yulian over. Yulian could feel his surroundings change once more. The first thing he saw was the desert moon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u2018I entered at dawn but it is already light. It is very peculiar.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cGlow!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As Yulian looked toward the direction of the voice, he saw Violet, the Shireans and the Red Storm all waiting for him.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

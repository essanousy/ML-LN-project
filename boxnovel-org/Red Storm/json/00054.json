Once he arrived, he found Dejaine who had just woken up.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou came very early.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to disturb your sleep so early in the morning, Glow Dejaine-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo worries, I always wake up at this time. Anyways, are you feeling okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel like I can immediately run around and hunt down a thousand wild animals and monsters.\u201d</p><br/><p>At Yulian\u2019s confident answer, Dejaine smiled before asking.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear. Let\u2019s get to the point. I\u2019m sure you came to look for me so early in the morning since you had something you wanted from me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian nodded his head and got straight to the point.</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope you can lend me two hundred of Rivolde\u2019s valiant warriors.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dejaine, who was curious as to what kind of plan Yulian would have come up with, was surprised at this request.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian nodded his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, that is it.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Yulian confirmed his request, Dejaine was shocked again.</p><br/><p>Honestly speaking, Dejaine thought Yulian would request a minimum of 5,000 warriors. Of that, the amount of warriors he could lend Yulian was around 3,000. That was the most he could spare in order to protect the oasis that the Rivolde controlled. However to just need two hundred\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean to tell me you can overpower them with only two hundred warriors?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have the Red Storm warriors as well as Pareia\u2019s Chief Shaman, Tuma Takaka-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven so, the total number is less than 300. (TL: THIS IS SPAAAAARTAAAA!) I know your Red Storm has many veteran warriors, and the warriors I would lend you will all be strong warriors who could rival their strength, but Pareia has so many valiant warriors. What can you do with that small amount\u2026\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian shook his head as he responded.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no reason to go against all of them. What I need the most right now is time. I\u2019m thankful that I was able to recover quickly and plan things out. I\u2019m sure it was my father blessing me from the heavens.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me. What do you plan to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian looked at Dejaine. Dejaine was his deceased father\u2019s sworn brother, and his wife\u2019s father. In addition, it was because he had such a great influence that he was known as the Great Glow.</p><br/><p>Yulian was sure Dejaine was tempted by Librie. There is no way that the devious Janet didn\u2019t think about the aftermath of the rebellion. The stupid Librie would have just followed whatever he told her to do.</p><br/><p>Yulian asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is something I need to first ask you as the Great Glow of Rivolde, as well as my father-in-law.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAsk.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did Librie request?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dejaine hesitated at Yulian\u2019s question. For a moment, he thought that someone released the details of that meeting. However, there was no way his son-in-law, who woke up yesterday and realized what happened before setting up his course of action, would know about it.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m sure it is just his intuition. His extremely sharp intuition.\u2019</p><br/><p>Dejaine thought like that as he started to laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you doubting me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I doubted you, I would have disappeared and you would not know where I have gone. I choose to trust the Great Glow and my father-in-law. However, I feel like I need to know. That is why I am asking.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dejaine was satisfied at Yulian\u2019s answer and responded.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure if that was the case, you wouldn\u2019t ask like this either. Fine, I will tell you. About a day after you arrived here, Librie sent someone over. She promised that she would hand over two of Pareia\u2019s 11 oasis in return for us catching you and returning you to Pareia as soon as you got here, or not giving you any help and pretending like we didn\u2019t see anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis! What a heinous woman.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had anticipated it, but hearing Dejaine say it out loud made him extremely angry, leading him to shout.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought that it would be better for me to pretend like I didn\u2019t know what was going on and accepted the request.\u201d</p><br/><p>At Dejaine\u2019s word, Yulian looked towards Dejaine with a shocked expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that? You need to make your opponent feel at ease in order to easily stab them in the back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c......\u201d</p><br/><p>This was why you could not ignore the old warriors. He was a very scary person, fitting the many years he has sat in the position of Glow.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are amazing. And very scary, Glow Dejaine-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dejaine smiled at Yulian\u2019s words and responded.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith just this much, I kept my loyalty to your father Baguna, as well as the love I have for you as my son-in-law. I am saying this because it was brought up, but I\u2019m sure you know better than I do that there needs to be a compensation for this help.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dejaine\u2019s words were expected and Yulian accepted it. And believed.</p><br/><p>Dejaine Nellisi. His father-in-law was someone he could spill everything to.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. Once we handle the rebels and defend against the Shuarei\u2019s attack, my gratitude for your help in this endeavor, I will return it a thousand, no ten thousand fold.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dejaine was very happy. The only thing that continues to develop as you get older is your ability to read people.</p><br/><p>His son-in-law was a really great warrior. He will become a hero. Dejaine believed that this promise will definitely be worth quite a bit in the future.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan I ask you about your plan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian started to share everything he thought about throughout the night.</p><br/><p>\u201cTime is of the essence. Before Janet and Librie can cause any more issues, I need to go around to each of Pareia\u2019s oasis.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor what reason?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI need to visit them individually to get their sworn loyalty. I trust in the wise chiefs of Pareia. I know that they will recognize that this plot was Librie and Janet\u2019s doing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dejaine challenged him.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd if they did not?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware. The position of Glow is one that only those who have been recognized as deserving can hold. Unless your abilities are recognized, no, more importantly, they will not accept Orca, who has not even completed his coming-of-age ceremony to be the Glow. I\u2019m sure they will think that it will be smarter to pick a new Glow from a different family. By now, the chiefs should be meeting to discuss this issue.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dejaine could not find any fault with Yulian\u2019s logic. The position of Glow in a tribe was not something that a little kid who has not completed his coming-of-age ceremony could hold.</p><br/><p>If it was his son-in-law\u2019s other brother Pere who had plotted like this, it would have been quite difficult.</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess you should be thankful that it wasn\u2019t your immediate younger brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian smiled at Dejaine\u2019s words as he responded.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough I lost my father because of this incident, I have gained my younger brother. If Pere was the one who caused this, I\u2019m sure I would not have had any way to fight back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian had the same thought as Dejaine.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it was Pere\u2026 if Pere had done this, everything would have been over.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

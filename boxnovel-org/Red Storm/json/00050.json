They were there to protect Grace, the Glow\u2019s daughter, from any potential followers.</p><br/><p>When Dejaine Nellisi arrived at the oasis, Yulian was still wandering between life and death. Even with Tuma Takaka\u2019s magnificent healing skills, Yulian didn\u2019t look like he was going to get better.</p><br/><p>The Red Storm warriors, as well as his family members, were all fearing that this was the end, and their faces were getting darker.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf my darling \u2026 if my husband Yulian dies, I will take his name. Yes, I will make sure to take his name and pay back this grudge of blood ten times worse.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grace\u2019s eyes were filled with a murderous aura before it went back to the sad look of despair as she watched Yulian laying down next to her. She was just spilling her thoughts to her father, Dejaine Nellisi.</p><br/><p>Grace had not moved a single step away from Yulian the last three days. She had a hard time eating anything; all she had been eating were small sips of juice squeezed from fruits.</p><br/><p>Her lovely and shiny hair was dry and full of knots, and she was getting so thin that you could clearly tell that she was getting weaker and weaker as time went by.</p><br/><p>Dejaine couldn\u2019t stand it anymore and was going to try to force his daughter out of there, but listening to Grace look at him while saying something like that, all he could do was stand there and listen to what his daughter had to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will hang her upside down in a tall pillar underneath the desert sun, make large holes in her shoulder and put a ton of bug bears that enjoy eating human flesh underneath her. I \u00a0will make sure to feed her everyday and lower the height of the pillar by 1 centimeter each day. I will not kill her. Until she dies from running out of blood, I will not let her die.\u201d (TL: Don\u2019t get on Grace\u2019s bad side, folks\u2026)</p><br/><p>Grace\u2019s words were so fierce that she could probably kill someone with just her words, and she was pouring out terrible curses for Librie to suffer.</p><br/><p>The thing that worried Dejaine the most was that even from a young age, this daughter of his always managed to do the things she said she would do. Nobody else knew just how much he wished Grace was born as a man because of his admiration of her tenacity and persistence.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve grown too weak. It\u2019ll be great if Yulian wakes up, but even if he cannot wake back up, it doesn\u2019t make sense for you to get this weak. Only healthy people can manage to get things done.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grace turned her head towards him as Dejaine continued speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cRevenge? Of course you need to get it. If my daughter says she needs to get revenge, we must get revenge. However, if you don\u2019t eat anything and don\u2019t get any sleep, will you even have the strength to get your revenge? You must take care of yourself first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, you are right. I need to be healthy to get my revenge. However, I will prepare for that once I know for sure whether my love is dead or alive. Right now, I feel worried if I don\u2019t see his face for even a split second...just too too worried\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Grace\u2019s sorrow, Dejaine approached his daughter and quietly hugged her while patting her back.</p><br/><p>Right at that moment, there was a lot of noise outside and Dejaine shouted out to them.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is going on out there to cause such a commotion?\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the warriors ran in from outside to answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is an old man claiming to be Yulian\u2019s master, as well as a member of the Pareia tribe named Veruna.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cVeruna?\u201d</p><br/><p>Grace remembered that he was Glow Baguna\u2019s personal warrior and ran out with Dejaine.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrace-nim!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Grace stepped out of the paoe, Veruna noticed her first and shouted towards her. Grace nodded her head and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cVeruna-nim, how did you come here\u2026\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Veruna looked back and forth between Chun Myung Hoon and Grace while answering.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is thanks to this person. This is Yulian-nim\u2019s wife, Grace Nellisi-nim\u2026 Grace-nim, this is Yulian-nim\u2019s master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grace, who had heard many stories about Yulian\u2019s master, weakly ran towards them and bowed her head in front of Chun Myung Hoon as she started to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, I, Grace Nellisi, pay my respects to you. I\u2019ve heard many things about you from my husband.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chun Myung Hoon took a long look at Grace.</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess my disciple at least has some luck with women. Taking a look at her aura, she has the aura of a phoenix. There\u2019s probably no issues in the bedroom.\u201d (TL: ;) Get it Yulian.)</p><br/><p>Chun Myung Hoon had a satisfied expression on his face as he started to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you are my disciple\u2019s wife, I will speak casually.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, of course.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou look very weak right now. I heard that you have suffered quite a bit. However, you do not need to worry anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Grace did not know the reason why, hearing Chun Myung Hoon speak made her feel calm. Was it because of all the stories she had heard from Yulian? She felt like everything would get better since he was here.</p><br/><p></p><ul style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt\"><br/><p></p><li style=\"list-style-type: disc;font-size: 11pt;font-family: Arial;color: #000000;background-color: transparent;font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">If I\u2019m being honest with you, my master is not human. When he first arrived, he didn\u2019t understand any of the languages of the continent, and his method of doing things were very different than what we consider to be normal. However, each and every one of his words hold weight and none of it is useless. His abilities are out of this world. I told you about it right? He was able to put out a dragon\u2019s breath of fire with a single wave of his hand.</li><br/><p></p></ul><br/><p>Yulian often spoke to Grace about Chun Myung Hoon. Most of the time it was about his master\u2019s ruthlessness, but Grace knew more than anyone else that hidden in those words were a sense of deep admiration and trust.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, this Grace is feeling calm just by meeting with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chun Myung Hoon was satisfied at Grace\u2019s actions and words and smiled again.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, where is Yulian?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the barracks\u2026 he is currently floating back and forth between life and death because of poison. Because it is not a poison of the desert, everybody is just helplessly watching\u2026...Senior, is there anything you can do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chun Myung Hoon had a look of surprise as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet us go take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Chun Myung Hoon entered the barracks, Yulian was indeed laying down as if he was dead. Seeing his disciple like this after not seeing him for five years, Chun Myung Hoon was very unhappy and started to frown.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow long has it been?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout ten days. We have worked hard during that time to find an antidote, but nothing seems to be working. Senior\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As Grace answered restlessly by his side, Chun Myung Hoon lifted up his sleeves and sat Yulian down. He then put his hands on Yulian\u2019s back and chest before his frown became even bigger.</p><br/><p>The poison had into his main acupuncture points, and was starting to seep into his heart.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

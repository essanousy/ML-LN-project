What they focused on was how much skills and incantations abilities a person had in order to protect the Shire and the sanctuary that has been passed down through the generations. That was what determined your status in the Shire.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With the young man speaking as the representative of the group, you could tell that he had the highest status amongst the group even though he was the youngest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cGrand Elder Shulmirutz-nim who has already returned to heaven told us something in the past. When Tuma Takaka-nim left with Orisen-nim, he mentioned that Tuma Takaka-nim acted according to your name. He said that you did not leave the Shire but left to fulfill your destiny. That was why Tuma Takaka-nim was approved as an elder of the Shire ten years ago.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Seeing the young man speak his teacher\u2019s name, Tuma Takaka closed his eyes and thought about his teacher. His teacher was very strict with his teachings as Tuma Takaka was being groomed to become the Grand \u00a0Elder of the next generation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cHe said something like that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Tuma Takaka\u2019s voice was shaking.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cPlease enter.

There was also a castle that was not the typical 5 meter tall castle, but one that was surrounded by one meter stone walls that were creating a giant circle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Inside of the circle were buildings made of stone instead of paoes. This was definitely a sight that Yulian and the Red Storm had never seen before. Even in the continent, the buildings made of stone were reserved for small castles for nobles or temples. It was rare to find.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Furthermore, each of these houses were all elaborately constructed and looked very luxurious.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cI feel like I am in a different world.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The young man simply smiled as Yulian spoke out in awe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Tuma Takaka responded instead.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cThis is a place that has existed together with the history of the desert.

The Shire is a place that is protected by magic and incantations that have existed from a long time ago.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Tuma Takaka said that to Yulian as he first took out different metallic items from his chest and put it on the ground. Yulian also put his greatsword and a sosoonta that was hidden at his chest on the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even the Red Storm who were showing signs of opposing the young man\u2019s words put their greatswords down on the ground. They did not like it, but seeing Yulian and Tuma Takaka stepping forward and dropping their weapons, they followed suit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cThank you, Glow.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cI need to follow the laws of the Shire since I have come as a guest.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As Yulian smiled and responded to the young man\u2019s words, the young man lightly smiled before bowing his head and motioned to his group once more.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The five members of the Shire started to move and Yulian and the Red Storm noticed their surroundings starting to spin. Yulian was thinking that it was odd when Tuma Takaka started to whisper next to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cThat entrance is a trap.

Yulian was used to this sensation. It was the same feeling he had when he touched the magic circle in the underground dungeon in the Monster\u2019s Desert.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The moment he closed his eyes and opened them back up, Yulian and the Red Storm were already inside the Shire. Once he blinked once more, there was a woman wearing a light purple silk outfit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cWelcome to the Shire, Yulian-nim, Tuma Takaka-nim, and the Red Storm warriors.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The woman, who had eyes shining brighter than the fireflies in the night sky, had purple hair that flowed down like a waterfall down to her hips. The tall woman who seemed to be at least 170cm tall, spoke in a voice that made you feel relaxed as she bowed her head at Yulian and the group.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"></span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The desert suns were shining down ruthlessly hot rays. There were many workers moving large pieces of stone underneath it. The masons were busy hammering away at the rocks to make them into the right sizes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Some of the site managers were shouting loudly as they were getting verbal about each other\u2019s work. The construction master that Edwin worked so hard to bring over was running around endlessly with the blueprint in his hand to talk to the site managers, stop people who were fighting, and give commands to keep the construction going.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This construction was harder than any other construction in the continent. Even with Pareia\u2019s shamans using incantations to change the weather every day, there was a limit to how much humans could do to lower the heat in the desert.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, they promised better wages than any other job. The person to make the contract with them was also not a noble but the Serubil Merchant Guild which had a great reputation so they didn\u2019t need to worry about not getting paid for their work. Thanks to that, the workers were able to persevere through the heat and continue their work.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cMm.

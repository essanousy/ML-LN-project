How much must you have been slacking off while I was gone that a single glass of poisonous water would make you like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian heard the blunt and familiar voice in his ear.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian suddenly sat up that Grace, who was in his embrace started to fall.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! Grace, sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian quickly grabbed Grace to prevent her from falling and turned his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve finally coming to your senses? The poison is all gone, so if you pretend you are still sick, I will kill you myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, when did you return? Oh, but where is this\u2026\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian looked around him. He was not in his paoe or his father\u2019s paoe.</p><br/><p>At Yulian\u2019s response, Chun Myung Hoon scoffed in disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cI save you from almost dying, but you\u2019re an idiot who didn\u2019t even know he could have died. Yes, if I wasn\u2019t here, you\u2019re the type of punk to ask King Yama \u2018what? I died?\u2019 aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian was confused at Chun Myung Hoon\u2019s words and looked at his master with a confused expression before turning to Grace.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you not remember anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRemember? I was in my father\u2019s paoe drinking alcohol with father and my brothers. Orca said he had some good alcohol so I drank it...and while I was drinking it \u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He remembered until drinking Orca\u2019s alcohol. However, he did not remember anything after that.</p><br/><p>Grace continued the restory on his behalf.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou fainted. There was poison in the alcohol. You and father fainted because of the poison, and Librie\u2019s tribe\u2019s warriors immediately charged into the paoe.</p><br/><p>Grace explained everything that happened to Yulian.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2026 how could something like this\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>While listening to Grace\u2019s explanation, Yulian was so angry he could not finish his words and just sat there with his fists clenched tightly on top of his thighs. Something he could not believe had happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather? What happened to father?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian realized the situation and urgently asked about his father Baguna\u2019s condition. Grace responded with a sad expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that your father still had a little bit of consciousness after drinking the alcohol. After father realized the rebellion that was happening, he ordered Pere-nim to take you and escape. There were too many warriors from Librie\u2019s group that Pere-nim could not escape with both father and you\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, what happened? What happened after that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhile Pere-nim and the Red Storm warriors were escaping with you to Rivolde where my father was, Librie sent people to each of the oasis. She said that you \u2026 that you murdered father and ran away and to kill you as soon as they found you\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Thump! Crack!</p><br/><p>Yulian was extremely angry and hit the couch; and the sound of the couch breaking could be heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cAAAAAAAAH!\u201d</p><br/><p>Soon, Yulian\u2019s sorrow-filled voice rang throughout the paoe.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone looked towards Yulian with sad expressions, and even Chun Myung Hoon turned his face away. Even he knew just how close the father and son were.</p><br/><p>Yulian shouted like that for a while before suddenly stopping.</p><br/><p>\u201cLibrie, I, that\u2026 that\u2026 bitch \u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian\u2019s eyes were extremely red and a murderous aura poured out of Yulian\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t just tell me, show me with your actions.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Chun Myung Hoon\u2019s words reached Yulian\u2019s ears, Yulian looked around him before standing up and bowing to the people around him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like all of you have suffered quite a bit because of me. There is something I need to think about. Please let me be alone for a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>At Yulian\u2019s request, everybody went outside the paoe. They couldn\u2019t feel the shock that Yulian was feeling, but they could imagine just how much shock he was in.</p><br/><p>Yulian came out of the paoe around the time the first moon started to come up.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chun Myung Hoon was waiting outside the paoe and asked once he saw Yulian.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is all thanks to you, master. Where did the rest of the people go?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI sent them all away. It looked like there was something you needed to tell me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou saw them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chun Myung Hoon nodded his head at Yulian\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry master. I went against your word. I was prepared to be beaten to death by you when I passed on the martial arts to my wife and the Red Storm warriors. It was something that I really needed to do...I\u2019m sorry, master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Watching his disciple bowing in front of him, Chun Myung Hoon continued to worry. Chun Myung Hoon had seen the Red Storm warriors training and noticed signs of his martial arts.</p><br/><p>His strength was not something that could thoughtlessly be shared in this world. He confirmed that thought while traveling through the western continent with the dragon for five years.</p><br/><p>In this world, those who could even just barely manage to use some sword force were known as masters and received a lot of respect. Of course, there weren\u2019t that many people who could let out their sword force in China, but it wasn\u2019t as rare as it was here. In a large or famous sect back in China, there were at least ten or so masters at that level. However, to pass on such martial arts in this world would end up causing chaos.</p><br/><p>Chun Myung Hoon continued to worry before finally asking.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow many of them are there in total?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are fifty-seven of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow much do they know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI taught them the basic methods and foundational stances. I did not dare to teach the rest before getting your permission\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Chun Myung Hoon cut Yulian off.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is it. I cannot accept anything more than that. It may be called the basic methods, but if they train long enough, they will figure things out on their own. That is the core of my arts. You are trying to make Pareia into a monster land in the continent aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Chun Myung Hoon indicated, although it was known as the basic methods, the thing that made the Gun Gon Shrine Law unique was the strength that came from setting the foundation and gaining experience (TL: I don\u2019t think he ever told us the name of it before, so GGSL it is.)</p><br/><p>If it was someone with Yulian\u2019s level of potential, with about twenty years of harsh training, they would all become masters for sure.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for giving me permission.\u201d</p><br/><p>Getting Chun Myung Hoon\u2019s approval made Yulian extremely happy and he kneeled in front of Chun Myung Hoon and kowtowed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYulian, I will give you a stern warning. I will approve of you having a kid in the future and passing down the martial arts to him, however, it must end with the current group of warriors. You may only pass it down to your blood. Nobody else.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you master.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no reason to be so happy. If I find that you\u2019ve went against my word one more time, I will chop off your head myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian did not stop smiling even at Chun Myung Hoon\u2019s harsh words.</p><br/><p>By the time the next generation of Red Storm was created, the current Red Storm warriors\u2019 abilities should be about his current level.</p><br/><p>If that\u2019s the case, even if it was not the GGSL, they can pass down the other training methods they have learned, and that alone will make them stronger than any of the other tribes.</p><br/><p>Plus, didn\u2019t his master say he could pass it down to his own children?</p><br/><p>Yulian kowtowed again and thanked him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you very much, master.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, so, what are you planning to do from here on? Glow Baguna was my friend as well. If you are okay with it, I want to get the revenge for you. Then the situation would calm down quickly; wouldn\u2019t that be great?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chun Myung Hoon was saying that he would get rid of all of those involved in the plot and restore things as they were, but surprisingly, Yulian shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure everyone will want me to take care of it with my own hands. In the end, this is an internal issue for the Provoke family, and it will only mean something if I take care of it myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou make it sound like I\u2019m an outsider.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Chun Myung Hoon spoke like he was upset, Yulian quickly shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour disciple treats his master as the heavens, how could you say such sad words?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian, who seemed to have regained his energy with Chun Myung Hoon giving him permission to train the red Storm warriors, spoke with a vigorous voice. This made Chun Myung Hoon feel better.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is fine. As long as you feel that way, that is what we will do. Then I will not take any part.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, just the fact that you are next to me makes me feel like I have hundreds of warriors with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chun Myung Hoon, who seemed to like what his disciple had to say, started to laugh while waving his hand once and returned to his paoe.</p><br/><p>Yulian waited until his master disappeared before looking at the moon in the sky.</p><br/><p>\u2018I will make sure to get my revenge.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian clenched his fists so tightly that his fingernails were digging into his palms.</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 1.</p><br/><p>Next up:</p><br/><p><strong>A Bloodless Civil War</strong></p><br/><p><i>Compared to the things that happened, it was resolved too easily.</i></p><br/><p><i>Should he pity their stupidity?</i></p><br/><p><i>Or, should he blame the woman who made everything a mess?</i></p><br/>\n</div>"}

It might not be responsible of me, but I truly feel that way. Nobody can kill me. And Red Storm just needs to chase after my back. Nobody in the desert can stop the Red Storm when we are charging in a straight line.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe enemy has already prepared and are waiting for us to attack. They also have over 20,000 warriors.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhether they have prepared or not, whether they number hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands, the ones who will be in our way will only number in the tens at once. I will pierce through and Red Storm will follow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you are so confident, why did you call us all here? Furthermore, how come I am not allowed to go?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy master mentioned that you must always be cautious just in case. No matter how perfect a plan is, as long as it is not something being done by the heavens, there will always be an opening. I am just hoping that you will fill that opening.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! You...you make me speechless.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t you always more action than words?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pere started to breathe heavily. Thanks to that, his shoulders went up and then fell down. He had given up. His hyung\u2019s head was already filled with this plan of his.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo whatever you want. To ask for our opinions when you have already made up your mind is the same as ignoring us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pere said that as if he was really angry and left the paoe. Shubeon watched with a disappointed gaze, as if he had lost a sturdy ally.</p><br/><p>\u201cShubeon, are you planning on opposing this until the end?\u201d</p><br/><p>Once Yulian asked, Shubeon signed internally as he responded. How could he convince him when his own flesh and blood failed to do so?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat good will it do for me to oppose it on my own when the other warriors have all agreed? I will start to prepare.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once the four Red Storm warriors left the paoe, Yulian put his greatsword on top of the table.</p><br/><p>This sword will be drenched in blood tonight.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuuuuuuuu~!\u201d</p><br/><p>Since he was nervous about it as well, Yulian started to take some deep breaths.</p><br/><p>At first, he considered asking his master for help and just charging in with just the two of them. However, he quickly go rid of that idea.</p><br/><p>\u2018If I keep on relying on my master, I will not be able to do anything without him in the future.\u2019</p><br/><p>That is what Yulian was thinking. That was why he had not told Chun Myung Hoon about this plan. Although his master wasn\u2019t one who wouldn\u2019t figure it out just because Yulian didn\u2019t tell him, he wanted to do it without his master\u2019s help.</p><br/><p>\u2018That sensation came every time I was in a battle. Since I felt it again this last battle, there shouldn\u2019t be any problems. The only question is whether I can succeed with just that.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yulian was seriously thinking.</p><br/><p>Honestly speaking, this plan was made relying on that intuition alone.</p><br/><p>The scenarios that get created in his mind even without him looking. The location of the enemy, the movement of the allies, this intuition was something that expanded his senses to the point that if he wanted to, he could even hear each person\u2019s breathing.</p><br/><p>He had wondered about how he had developed such intuition after the first campaign against the Shuarei, and what he finally realized after thinking about ti for a long time was that it was the blessing of the Red Dragon he met during his coming-of-age ceremony.</p><br/><p>- May you have the protection of the Gods.</p><br/><p>IT was hard to believe, but there could not be any other answers.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m sure Venersis has this type of intuition as well. He must have become a War God because of the protection of the Gods.\u2019</p><br/><p>That was what Yulian believed. According to his master, both Venersis and he had received the mandate of heaven.</p><br/><p>As complicated thoughts started to fill his mind, Yulian strongly shook his head. He decided to only think about one thing right now.</p><br/><p>\u2018As long as I do my part we will not fail.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yulian firmed that resolve in his mind and decided to only think about that right now.</p><br/><p>The Red Storm were warriors who had trained like that.</p><br/><p>A bit later, Haisha returned to let Yulian know that they were prepared to move. Yulian stood up from his seat and put his greatsword on his waist as he stepped out.</p><br/><p>Yulian slowly looked around the Red Storm warriors who were lined up in four lines under the sunlight.</p><br/><p>Although this really was a reckless plan, he could not find even a glimpse of fear in the eyes of his warriors. Rather, they were all shining as much as the swords on their sides.</p><br/><p>Yulian asked in a loud voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you all hear?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOOwooooooooo~!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOthers may think that this is reckless. However, I believe in myself, as well as us. Am I wrong to feel this way?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOowoooooooooo~!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you confident? Are you confident that you will not die? Are you confident that you will be able to follow me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOowooooooooo~!\u201d</p><br/><p>Each time Yulian said something, the Red Storm warriors chanted back in union.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, let\u2019s go. Once today is over, The Wikaly, as well as the entire desert will know. They will know why we are the Red Storm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOowoooooooooo~!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will finish this before the sun comes back up.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Red Storm started to move forward at Yulian\u2019s command.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>As the sun started to head down, the Wikaly patrol warriors saw a group of warriors in the distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there some type of training today?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hear about anything like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>One warrior answered another warrior\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what are those warriors?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. Did anybody receive a message?\u201d</p><br/><p>The other warriors shook their heads.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it perhaps Pareia\u2019s warriors?\u201d</p><br/><p>When one of the warriors asked that, the rest started to laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t even seem like there are 100 of them. Maybe 60, or 70 max? You think Pareia will charge in with that many people?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess unless they were crazy, they would not attempt to charge in with that small amount.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey might be the diplomatic team. Since two of their Greatest Warriors are captured, wouldn\u2019t they need to come negotiate the ransom for their release?\u201d</p><br/><p>As one of the warriors shared their thoughts, all of them nodded their heads. They were moving pretty fast and had quite a large party for a diplomatic team, but it wasn\u2019t too many people to the point that it would be really weird.</p><br/><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we still question them?\u201d</p><br/><p>The five patrol warriors agreed and started to ride toward the arriving bunch.</p><br/><p>Their thought process was pretty normal if you think about it. Nobody would expect someone to try to do something to an oasis with 20,000 warriors with less than 60.</p><br/><p>But their mistake was that all five of them rode toward them.</p><br/><p>At least one of them should have rushed back to the oasis to notify them of the situation.</p><br/><p>The heads of the five warriors who were just talking flew up in the air with the sun to their back, before falling to the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe cannot give the enemy any time to prepare. We need to rush in like a storm and escape like the wind.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian shouted toward the Red Storm warriors.</p><br/><p>\u201cOowooooooo~!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although they were the enemy, to kill the patrol warriors like this did not make any of them feel good.</p><br/><p>But this was not the time to become emotional about something like that. This was the middle of a war and it was their fault for forgetting about their mission as patrol officers.</p><br/><p>Yulian and Red Storm killed other Wikaly patrol warriors like that as they continued to rush forward.</p><br/><p>The Wikaly camp only realized what was going on when two moons rose up into the night sky. It was only after Yulian and the Red Storm crossed the wooden fences around the oasis and reached right in front of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is a surprise attack from Pareia!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Wikaly warriors who noticed the Red Storm rushing forward while killing their peers started to shout and there was chaos in the oasis as they were surprised by the warriors\u2019 shouts.</p><br/><p>As they were still prepared for battle, that chaos did not last too long.</p><br/><p>Abham quickly gathered his equipment and started to command the warriors with Runa, and it quickly felt like Yulian and the Red Storm was captured in their encirclement.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Glow of Pareia, the Desert Conqueror Yulian Provoke and the Red Storm have come to retrieve Pareia\u2019s warriors.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Yulian lifted up his chest and shouted loudly with 20,000 Wikaly warriors watching him, all of them could not help but be shocked.</p><br/><p>They came with just that many people?</p><br/><p>And where is he getting such arrogant confidence from?</p><br/><p>Yulian looked around at the frozen Wikaly warriors, and the ones who made eye contact with him subconsciously turned their heads away.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are Vibli and Trebol? Their Glow has arrived.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Yulian shouted once more, Runa finally came to his senses and started to urgently talk to Abham.</p><br/><p>\u201cAbham-nim, are you just going to sit back and watch? The morale of our warriors is falling.\u201d</p><br/><p>Abham nodded his head at Runa\u2019s words and started to shout as he stepped forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cPareia\u2019s Glow, I respect your courage. However, we are in the middle of a war right now! Do not think we will let you return safely when you have dug your own grave. We will end this war by capturing you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Yulian turned his head toward Abham, Abham almost subconsciously flinched.</p><br/><p>If he did not remember that he was the Commanding Greatest Warrior, he certainly would have done so.</p><br/><p>\u201cToday, I will show you why I am called the Desert Conqueror. I will show you why I have received the title of the War God of the East. I suppose I can retrieve my warriors by capturing you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian shouted like that as he lifted his greatsword high into the sky. As the moonlight reflected off of the sword, it felt like that light was enveloping Yulian\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Yulian started to move and the Red Storm started to follow.</p><br/><p>Yulian and Red Storm were like a wild animal in a herd of pinas. Nobody could stop Yulian\u2019s movements, nor could they stop the Red Storm warriors following behind him. All they could do was chase after them once they passed by.</p><br/><p>Some of the valiant Wikaly warriors tried to get in between them, but they just ended up injured or dead for no reason.</p><br/><p>The saying that one hand cannot block ten hands did not apply to them.</p><br/><p>Each of their greatswords had no problem overpowering ten shamshirs.</p><br/><p>Runa, who was seeing Yulian and Red Storm\u2019s might with his own eyes for the first time, could not hide his astonishment.</p><br/><p>This must be why the Shuarei, as well as Ebinong, suffered terrible defeats. It was because they did not know about this overpowering strength and ability to charge forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cAbham-nim!\u201d</p><br/><p>Runa called out to Abham and Abham was finally about to take his eyes off of their power that he was seeing again.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must hand out orders! If we cannot handle them quickly, it will become a curse in our warriors\u2019 minds. Please move the warriors. This might actually be a chance for us. If it is not today, who can catch them in battle?\u201d</p><br/><p>Abham looked back toward Yulian and Red Storm. They still did not seem to be having any trouble.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll units, change to the Old Moon formation.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Wikaly warriors started to come together at their leader\u2019s command. As long as they had an order, they must follow it even if it leads to their death.</p><br/><p>At first they were shocked, and then it became chaotic, but as time went by, their fighting spirit started to burn and their movement started to become more agile.</p><br/><p>And as layers after layers of encirclement surrounded Yulian and Red Storm, Yulian\u2019s intuition started to awaken.</p><br/><p>The enemy\u2019s movements, location, where they were the strongest, where they were weakest, all of those images were drawn in his head. Most importantly, the exit route that he needed was drawn as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am the Glow of Pareia!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yulian shouted at the top of his lungs as he ran forward to head toward that exit route.</p><br/><p>\u201cOowooooooo~!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Red Storm warriors responded to Yulian\u2019s shout and did their best to stick behind him.</p><br/><p>Become a patron and get advanced chapters!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

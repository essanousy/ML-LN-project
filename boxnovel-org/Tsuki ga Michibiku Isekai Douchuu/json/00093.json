No, honestly speaking, none. The most would be the occasional times I go to shoot the bow.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not like I have gotten into a fight with anyone. There was a more simple reason.</p><br/><p>\u201cShiki, can we go now?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Even if I am trying to evade it, I still have business there so I have no choice. That\u2019s why Shiki and I are returning.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, it is fine. I have already arranged the reports on our side. It should be okay to leave the business to Lime\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Wait, you intent to open?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>It makes me uneasy, so maybe we should just make it a break.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t a regular holiday and it hasn\u2019t been that long since we opened the store, so I think it isn\u2019t that recommended to close arbitrarily. I have ordered them to put on wait any business offers, so there\u2019s no need to worry\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>I am leaving a lot of the handling of the store to Shiki after all. I feel some sort of dignity there.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Chief Shiki says so, I will believe. Then\u2026 let\u2019s go\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Without waiting for his answer, I open a mist gate.</p><br/><p>While holding a melancholic feeling, I return to the Asora I missed.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, I feel a thick smell and heat.</p><br/><p>Just by being there I was beginning to sweat, and the warm and damp air enters my lungs.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, the climate of Asora that was unstable has recently been stabilized in a high temperature tropic climate.</p><br/><p>How discomforting. It is hot and humid, and there\u2019s no sight of rain. I\u2019m not really sure if there are, but this makes me feel like there are tropical rain forests out there.</p><br/><p>If it were on the level of everlasting summer it would be bearable, but this one easily surpassed the summer in Japan and it was on the level of murder.</p><br/><p>This is the reason why I haven\u2019t visited Asora recently. I mean, it is really harsh you know!</p><br/><p>I thought it would soon change its climate again, but there is no signs of it changing. At this rate, won\u2019t the agriculture be affected?</p><br/><p>I ordered Tomoe to investigate and she told me that she has gotten to the stage where the report is in order, but she will certainly come with a proposition which has high experimental rate. Well, for now this heat hasn\u2019t affected the area that much.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hot as usual\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. The Academy seems to be in spring and it is easy to live in, so it makes this place feel even hotter\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though you say that, you have a refreshing expression though, Shiki\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind heat that much after all. Raido- I mean, Waka-sama\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 In this place I don\u2019t really mind which way you call me you know?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cMio-dono\u2026 doesn\u2019t seem to like you being called Raidou-sama that much so\u2026\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>While making a wry smile, Shiki scratches his cheek. He is worrying about the small details huh.</p><br/><p>I just nod lightly and, shaking the air coiling around me, enter my home.</p><br/><p>It is even night and it is still this hot. Seriously, what is going on?</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u201cWaka-sama, welcome back!\u201d</p><br/><p>When I open the door of the hall where Tomoe and I decided the meeting to be, a big amount of voices suddenly welcomed me!</p><br/><p>That scared me! My heart is beating like crazy you know?! What, just what is happening?!</p><br/><p>With my mouth still open, I look inside the room and there I saw the residents of Asora gathered.</p><br/><p>Doesn\u2019t this look like\u2026 everyone is here?</p><br/><p>Surrounding a big table, all of them were gathered without care for the race.</p><br/><p>Was there such a crazy big table like this? No, there wasn\u2019t. That means it was recently made. Using an incredible trunk of a tree just like that, they\u2026 Eh?</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t it way too big? A table that can easily take more than a 100 people easily, just what kind of giant tree is that? Did they cut a world tree or something?</p><br/><p>Also, this hall. The house was on the big side, but even so, it wasn\u2019t this wide. With this, it isn\u2019t a hall made for meetings, this is more like the halls aristocrats use to do their parties!</p><br/><p>With surprise still showing in my face, I shake my head to the sides and check the situation. Everyone is looking at me with smiles in their faces.</p><br/><p>And then, Tomoe and Mio as well as Ema come to where I am.</p><br/><p>\u2026 That Tomoe, she is showing a face like her surprise was a total success.</p><br/><p>Damn it, why is she so happy about tricking Shiki and me?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Shiki, are you okay?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Waka-sama\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>He doesn\u2019t show any signs of being agitated. The retainer that has been the longest time with me recently. Not only that, he is smiling.</p><br/><p>Eh?</p><br/><p>Eh, eh?</p><br/><p>\u201cWelcome back, Waka\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cWelcome back, Waka-sama\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>When they are in a close distance, Tomoe and Mio welcome me once again. Ema was one step away and lowering her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cA, yeah. I am back\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>While still confused, I answer with \u201cI am back\u201d.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood work, Shiki. Just like planned, it seems like Waka didn\u2019t notice anything\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Tomoe grins while talking to Shiki across me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWaka-sama, I am sorry. Tomoe-san said she wanted to do a surprise no matter what so\u2026 Lately, you haven\u2019t come here at all, so please just think of this as a cute prank\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Even Mio.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Shiki, you too huh. You were also involved in this.</p><br/><p>Aaah!</p><br/><p>Geez! They got me!</p><br/><p>\u201cHaaah~ you really did surprise me. I am back! Also, I am sorry for not coming back often!\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, Waka seems to not be used to heat that much so I understand how you feel. Everyone wants you to return a little bit more often. Then, this\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Tomoe gives me a glass. It has a characteristic scent. Alcohol huh. A night party, I don\u2019t really mind. It\u2019s a substance with pink color. If I remember correctly, this is a Sake that\u2019s made by some sort of fruit and sold well in Tsige.</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s gazes gather on me and all of them contain expectation. Ah, I see. This being a dinner party and me, the leading person, holding a glass means that huh.</p><br/><p>\u201cCHEERS!!\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I lift the glass high and announce the cheers. From several places, the sound of glass hitting resonates.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been so long right? Tomoe, Mio. Also Ema\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Before I noticed, Mio was holding a plate of food with the hand that\u2019s not occupied by the glass. Wah, so fast. But the party has begun, so it isn\u2019t bad to have as much fun as you can.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeriously-desu zo. Asking us to investigate while you go to the Academy, only minding about children and business\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone missed you. Waka-sama, please come back to Asora more often. I beg of you\u201d (Ema)</p><br/><p>It\u2019s from Tomoe and Ema. Well, I receive the obvious scolding. If it were just hot it would be one thing, but I simply can\u2019t handle the humid sensation that coils around too well. When I don\u2019t have business I don\u2019t really want to do it that much, but I really should return to Asora a bit more.</p><br/><p>My knowledge gathering in the Academy is going well too and there is no point in learning this world\u2019s knowledge and common sense completely. It isn\u2019t like I knew all about my place of origin Japan after all.</p><br/><p>When I gain the basic common sense and knowledge, I should move to the next step. Knowledge is gained to be used after all. Actually, I am able to playback my memories in Asora and I am clearly reading more than I did in my previous world.</p><br/><p>I feel a bit bad about copying all the contents of the library just by reading, but it isn\u2019t like I am selling them so please forgive me, is what I use as an excuse. I am a small being.</p><br/><p>However, I am a bit worried about how little Mio has talked. She spoke with me a while ago, so I don\u2019t think she is in a dangerous state. I was actually prepared to accompany her in all her talking.</p><br/><p>\u201cU-Uhm. If you want, please accept this\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>And when I thought that, Mio encouraged me to take the plate of food in her hands. T-To bring food for others. Maybe it was because she has been influenced by the adventurers and the people of town? That\u2019s admirable Mio!</p><br/><p>\u201cMio, thank you. Heh~ it looks like what I have eaten in Tsige. Un, the flavor is thicker than in Tsige and suits my taste. It\u2019s really delicious\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>It\u2019s like the improved version of the food of Tsige that I was thinking would be better if its taste was thicker. The details are subtly different, but it is probably made by someone from the sub-branch who took an interest in the cooking of Tsige.</p><br/><p>I see. Just like this, there\u2019s also the pattern of Tsige influencing the culture of Asora. It is a happy happening to be able to eat the food of that town. I have been in Academy Town so I haven\u2019t eaten the cooking of Tsige for a while.</p><br/><p>\u201cN, what\u2019s wrong? Mio, you were the one who brought it, so you eat as well\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even when she recommended the food, Mio looks like she is enduring something and closing her eyes in silence. What? Today Mio is really weird.</p><br/><p>\u201cMio?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cAhahaha! Waka, Mio is overcome with emotions!\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cTomoe\u2026 overcome with emotions?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. What Waka ate was actually something Mio made\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>W-What?!</p><br/><p>\u201cMade?! Mio did?!\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. It seems that she has awakened to cooking lately. She lowered her head to the cooks in Tsige and is learning cooking from them. Also, she is cooperating in reproducing Japanese food. Sadly, we didn\u2019t make it in time for this occasion. The food over there is practically all made by Mio with all her heart\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Being told that, I once again look at the food spread on the table. Large plates filled with food, fruits beautifully cut up, soup in pots\u2026</p><br/><p>This\u2026 was made by Mio.</p><br/><p>\u2026 Isn\u2019t that impressive?</p><br/><p>Even if she awakened to cooking, it has only been a few months.</p><br/><p>If you ask me about what food I could cook with that amount of time\u2026 Ah, it would be the time when I messed up the water in the rice cooker and it became a big uproar. A past I want to forget. </p><br/><p>I am totally in despair about the difference in learning capabilities. And at the same time, I am honestly impressed by how amazing Mio is.</p><br/><p>To be able to reproduce the food she ate in the stores in such a short period of time.</p><br/><p>\u201cMio, you are incredible. It was really delicious\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I tell her my honest feelings.</p><br/><p>Mio trembles for a second and slowly opens her closed eyes. Her face was filled with satisfaction.</p><br/><p>\u201cWaka-sama, to think that cooking was such a wonderful thing. I didn\u2019t know\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Weren\u2019t you practicing for a while now? Also, you were practicing because you liked it right?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 No, I didn\u2019t understand. And today, I have learned true happiness\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I see\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! Waka-sama, next time I will prepare something even more delicious! That\u2019s right, more, more-desu!\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Suddenly making a proclamation, I thought that Mio was going to head to the food in the table, but she actually went the opposite way and left the hall.</p><br/><p>W-What happened?</p><br/><p>\u201cYareyare, that Mio. Looking at her like that, she probably intents to ignore the report meetings that are to come-ja na. Well, aside from the ingredient reports, she only has a few cases in Tsige that I already know of, so it shouldn\u2019t pose any problems\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cTomoe, uhm, Mio is\u2026?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cProbably in Tsige. Right now, it seems like an adventurer with rare cooking techniques is there. It seems like in exchange of learning cooking from that person, Mio is taking care of a lot of difficulties for her. I pity her, looking at Mio\u2019s state, she will probably be dragged into an all-nighter\u201d (Tomoe) </p><br/><p>What a nuisance she is being. Even though cooking is like an odd job technique for adventurers. Well, Mio is looking after a lot of problems so it should prove as beneficial for her principal occupation. Well, there\u2019s no need to worry huh. It seems like she is engrossed in cooking, so I don\u2019t have to worry about her injuring that adventurer.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it is good that she is satisfied\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for your lenient words. Then, there are A LOT of people that have been wanting to meet Waka, so let\u2019s go together. The meeting can be done later. Ah, I don\u2019t mind you drinking sake, but please try not to get drunk. Shiki, and master as well\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like it will be a long night huh\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cI will restrain from Sake. I feel like it would affect my actions in tonight\u2019s report meeting after all\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cShiki is really uptight-ja no. I won\u2019t say it is bad, but you are being too stiff. I think it would be nice to have a bit of alcohol in your system. Ah that\u2019s right, since we have the chance, let\u2019s have food brought into the room of Waka where we will be holding the meeting. Ema, can I leave this to you?\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I will have it done. Everyone seems to be so happy to see Waka-sama after a long time. Today\u2019s drinks seems to be quite a lot, so there will probably be people who will be dead drunk soon. I will gather people and have them prepare to nurse\u201d (Ema)</p><br/><p>Ema lively gives orders as she disappears into the crowd. Even if she looks like that, she is the type that likes Sake. We have made her take on a hard task. I will have tell someone to bring her food and Sake later.</p><br/><p>Anyways, that Tomoe. I thought this at the time of Lime as well but, this girl, she really acts like a rogue. To drink while deciding our plans huh. Since it is like this, I feel like I will hear good news but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cNow now, Waka. From the eldwas first, in order. They can\u2019t wait anymore. They have been doing their best. Do reward them please\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I understand\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>No objections here. Everyone is really doing their best. I haven\u2019t been coming that often, but I understand plenty enough.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no need for Tomoe to tell me. If I am enough, I want to go to the places of everyone and give them my thanks.</p><br/><p>Along with Tomoe and Shiki, I head to the residents who have made a line and waiting for me.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

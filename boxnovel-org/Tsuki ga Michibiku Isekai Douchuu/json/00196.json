And yet, in this place that he has brought her into himself -In Asora-, Sari has been unable to make contact with Raidou properly.</p><br/><p>The actual state of affairs is that the time she has been staring at the starry sky has increased.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be that Raidou is the king of a different world?\u201d </p><br/><p>Sari looked at the starry sky and thought this.</p><br/><p>It is heavily different from how Raidou himself sees it, but the understanding of Sari wasn\u2019t that far from reality.</p><br/><p>He has a space called Asora.</p><br/><p>That space has been expanding in size, and currently, it has a vast land, sky, and sea. It is already in a state where it is fitting to call it a \u2018world\u2019.</p><br/><p>And one can only enter Asora with them as intermediaries, and they themselves can enter and exit as they want.</p><br/><p>From the standpoint of Sari who doesn\u2019t know the circumstances, Raidou is the king of a parallel world, and she is a guest of his world. Without any decorated words, she can even be considered an \u2018intruder\u2019.</p><br/><p>His attitude of antagonising the Goddess could now be understandable in her view.</p><br/><p>But if that\u2019s the case, the fact that \u2018Raidou is a hyuman\u2019, would be a contradiction in itself, is how Sari thought.</p><br/><p>Or could it be that there\u2019s hyumans in parallel worlds as well, and this world is under the protection of an existence like that of a Goddess?</p><br/><p>If that\u2019s the case, why is there no other hyuman in this world called Asora?</p><br/><p>What about an existence that is related to that Goddess?</p><br/><p>For a while since she is been here, Sari has been flooded by this thoughts that had no answers, and was unable to act.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways, becoming a friend of Raidou is the first priority. If I become a close friend of his\u2026Raidou probably wouldn\u2019t do \u2018something as meager\u2019 as turning his fangs towards the demon race\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Raidou \u2018always\u2019 moves by his emotions.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s what Sari guesses.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why, she will be by his side, and if she is able to change those emotions of his, she will be able to obtain safety.</p><br/><p>She has been calmly looking at Raidou when she was outside, and that\u2019s why, she reached this conclusion and acted in this way. It could be said that she got a good grasp on him.</p><br/><p>\u2026It can\u2019t be considered a perfect analysis though.</p><br/><p>In Sari\u2019s view, it was a scary result.</p><br/><p>If imprudently dealt, Raidou might not even care about the whole picture, and destroy a country and race just because of a reason like being asked by someone close to him.</p><br/><p>If someone with a deep hatred towards the demon race becomes a close friend of his, or a lover, there\u2019s a possibility of Raidou turning hostile towards the demon race.</p><br/><p>Things like diplomacy, period, or economics; those kind of things would hold no weight.</p><br/><p>If even Raidou turns into an enemy, added with the heroes and the Goddess, the demon race will be exterminated.</p><br/><p>Sari was sure of this.</p><br/><p>Looking at Asora, she thought exactly like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cTotally self-sufficient. Even though powerful races are mixed here, they have an army that works together splendidly well. They clearly possess crafts that surpass ours by several steps. A teleportation ability that not only makes it possible for them to attack any place without the need for a march, it can also be used for retreats. Added to that, there\u2019s the abnormally high individual battle power of the close aides of Raidou.\u201d (Sari)</p><br/><p>If she had to put out a weakness of them, it would be their numbers.</p><br/><p>Asora doesn\u2019t have that much population.</p><br/><p>For a fertile land, it has a low population to the point that it was strange.</p><br/><p>Sari still didn\u2019t know of the reason why.</p><br/><p>But even the hyumans that are the strongest force in her world, would they really fight against them just because they are winning in numbers, when all of these disadvantages are lined up?</p><br/><p>If her father the Demon Lord had accurate information of Raidou and Asora, what would he have done? She tried to imagine it.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if it\u2019s slightly disadvantageous, he would probably make an alliance. Fufufu, it doesn\u2019t sound like it would be a talk to a company, but a talk between countries.\u201d (Sari)</p><br/><p>By the way, if Sari were the Lord, she would have wished to migrate into this Asora.</p><br/><p>But that\u2019s because she still hasn\u2019t been in a position of responsibility within the race, and he is a rare type of hyuman that the demon race doesn\u2019t hate.</p><br/><p>As long as Raidou acknowledges it, it would be a great proposal that would lead to the least sacrifices, and would bring a peaceful future.</p><br/><p>In a sense, it would be a proposal that would be ideal for the future of the race.</p><br/><p>But\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWithout doubt, there will objections from the majority, moreover, there\u2019s the danger of me being assassinated for it. The hatred for hyumans\u2026and the will of the demon race. If this is the will of the demon race, his Majesty would oppose this proposition even if it is the path to destruction.\u201d (Sari)</p><br/><p>Sari had a sad expression in her face.</p><br/><p>Thinking about her father, this is something that comes into her mind at times; just what kind of existence is an excelling Lord?</p><br/><p>There\u2019s probably several different types, but the Demon Lord Zef is the type of Lord that would make reality the demon race\u2019s will. </p><br/><p>For that sake, he would easily shelve his own will.</p><br/><p>In that sense, the actions of Zef are incredibly simple.</p><br/><p>Pass judgement to the hyumans, and prosperity to the demon race.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s all.</p><br/><p>And those two come in a set.</p><br/><p>It can\u2019t be toppled.</p><br/><p>Sari does think that having the demon race prosper and triumphing over the hyumans is one way of revenge, but most of the demons don\u2019t think that way.</p><br/><p>They want the blood of hyumans.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Raidou were to approve of the demon race\u2019s objective of passing judgement to the hyumans, there would be a different path. Just that, the chances of it are way too low.\u201d (Sari)</p><br/><p>In the end, she couldn\u2019t put anything in order.</p><br/><p>It was at that moment\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cSari, are you available now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c!! Yes, go ahead, Waka-sama.\u201d (Sari)</p><br/><p>Sari heard a voice there\u2019s no way she would hear wrong.</p><br/><p>By the way, the one who opened the door was the owner of the voice.</p><br/><p>The lifelong master of Sari; the person who she bounded her own stigma with.</p><br/><p>No one was accompanying him today.</p><br/><p>Without knowing about her worries at all, Raidou naturally entered her room.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look well. Are you okay?\u201d (Raidou)</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay. I am just slightly in disorder because I am still not used to my surroundings. I am sorry for making you worry. Is there something you needed?\u201d (Sari)</p><br/><p>\u201cI wanted to have Sari work a bit in something, you see.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cJust say the word. Giving this much hospitality to a slave like me, there\u2019s no need to be reserved.\u201d (Sari)</p><br/><p>These were the true feelings of Sari.</p><br/><p>As a slave, Sari has received a better treatment than what she was prepared for.</p><br/><p>They are not forcing her into any work, so right now, the treatment they are giving her is like that of a guest.</p><br/><p>It was temporary, but she was still in an unbelievable situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. Tomorrow morning, there\u2019s a race I want you to meet. Meet them, and well, I want you to hear their requests and what they have to say.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind but, is that a job that\u2019s okay for me to be doing?\u201d (Sari)</p><br/><p>Even with this light explanation, it was clear that this had an atmosphere different from that of a miscellaneous job.</p><br/><p>Because of that, Sari asks to confirm.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. We are low in people, and Shiki did say that you seem to have past knowledge.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Meaning that I can be useful, right? Understood. I am happy that you believe in me enough to give me work.\u201d (Sari)</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause you can\u2019t betray us, right? With the ritual and all that.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I don\u2019t have the intentions to betray you either, and I can\u2019t betray you. Even so, you don\u2019t have any suspicions that there may be some sort of loophole. I am truly lucky that the person I have decided as my master is an open-minded person.\u201d (Sari)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Loophole huh. I didn\u2019t even think about it. Because there\u2019s no need to think about it, right?\u201d (Makoto) </p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d (Sari)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Because if you do something like that, Sari would be my enemy, right? You must have some reason to work under me with the resolve to die, so something as careless as that, the intelligent Sari wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am not good at thinking that much. Betrayers are enemies, contributors are allies. That\u2019s how I think, and that\u2019s all. I want to go simple.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>What a scary thing to say, is what Sari thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor example; in the case that it looks like a betrayal when it was actually for the good of Waka-sama?\u201d (Sari)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I notice that it is good, then an ally; if I don\u2019t notice it, enemy. Simple, right?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Raidou nonchalantly said this.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Sari was speechless.</p><br/><p>She added into her data that he is someone with a thought pattern that\u2019s scarier than she originally thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing. I will keep those words in mind.\u201d (Sari)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I see. And so, about the race I want you to meet.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d (Sari)</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a race that wants to migrate to this place you see, a race called Lorelei. It seems like they were originally from the demon race, but as they were living in the sea, it seems like they have become a different race and things changed. Have you heard about it?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Lorelei?!\u201d (Sari)</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, it looks like you know them.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cI have heard that in a long past, there was a household of the demon race that was called Lorelei that had escaped into the sea and disappeared.\u201d (Sari)</p><br/><p>\u201cThen it is probably them. Their outward appearance is similar to the demon race after all. It seems like they were in quite the cold sea, but because of a slight connection, there was talk about having them migrate here, you see.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cMigrate?!\u201d (Sari)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so, there\u2019s going to be an interview. But there\u2019s the need to arrange the information of the race and the requests the other side has beforehand, right? I am counting on you for that.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026This place accepts the migration of a race?\u201d (Sari)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, well, depends on the situation though. This time it is applications for people that live in the sea, it seems.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems? Wasn\u2019t Waka-sama the one who ordered it?\u201d (Sari)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, would that be the case? Asora is big after all. Even if everything moves as I order, there\u2019s just no time. The people that want to live here can participate in an interview by all means, is how I feel. But in reality, there\u2019s a lot going on, and it can\u2019t go smoothly like that.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Is that so.\u201d (Sari)</p><br/><p>\u201cSari, you can have a house made somewhere eventually. If you want to, after the migration of the Lorelei is decided, it should be fine to live with them. It seems like you were the same race in the past after all.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Raidou continued making carefree statements.</p><br/><p>But he is the king of this Asora.</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I see\u2026 Uhm! About the investigation, I will properly do it. Is it okay to begin starting tomorrow?\u201d (Sari)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I am counting on you. I will place a Gorgon and an Orc to assist you, so go at it without pressure.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>(\u2026Is it for surveillance? Or is it really out of goodwill? This plan is probably from someone else, so there\u2019s that chance, and it makes it hard to tell.) (Sari)</p><br/><p>\u201cSari?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, sorry! Thank you for your kindness, Waka-sama.\u201d (Sari)</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, good night.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cGood night.\u201d (Sari)</p><br/><p>Sari still doesn\u2019t know Raidou\u2019s real name.</p><br/><p>She hasn\u2019t been told.</p><br/><p>Leaving aside Raidou himself, she is in a situation where her surroundings don\u2019t trust her.</p><br/><p>She doesn\u2019t know that reality, but she does feel like she is being tested.</p><br/><p>Even if she is ready or not, Sari thought that from now on, it was a critical moment for her.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Shiki. About the preliminary investigation, I have requested it from Sari just like you told me.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks, Waka-sama. If we don\u2019t make those kind of people work, it would be a bad example. You have been a big help.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cI was being reserved because she was a girl after all. Because you told me, it served as a chance. The one that should be giving his thanks is me.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cI am grateful to hear that.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way, what\u2019s that?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>After returning from asking Sari to investigate the Lorelei, I met with Shiki and follow his gaze, and there, I saw Ema and the Al-Elemera.</p><br/><p>Just that, the Al-Elemeras that are always flying around, are now on the floor.</p><br/><p>What a rare sight.</p><br/><p>Reflexively, I ask Shiki for an explanation of the situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, just like you see. The Al-Elemera are, how to say it, partly similar to Waka-sama.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cEhm\u2026\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t understand the meaning of Shiki\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooking for a place to live in, they were strolling the forest, and in the very first day, they broke onto the den the wolves live in.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Uwaaa\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>All of a sudden they were at that place huh.</p><br/><p>What an unlucky bunch.</p><br/><p>Ah, they are indeed similar to me in that part.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey were splendidly scattered and are now like this. Not everyone can cut through their bad luck like Waka-sama does after all. Well, it can be said that they are normal.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that I look properly, they are doing dogeza. Ah, Ema did say something like that. I see\u2026the king and the important people are doing dogeza huh.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, all the race is.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Quite a big part was caught by the wolves huh.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Their numbers are a lot less than when I saw them last time.</p><br/><p>The wolves against them wouldn\u2019t even amount to a fight.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey have been scared witless and have run back here.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>The wolves of Asora are crazy strong.</p><br/><p>No, it seems like the living beings of Asora in general are quite strong. The carnivorous beasts are especially strong within that group.</p><br/><p>Currently, the wolves are in the strongest class.</p><br/><p>If it turns into a serious fight with them, even Orcs and Lizardmen might be in danger. </p><br/><p>They are like experts in forest and group fights.</p><br/><p>\u2026The first time I encountered them, I was truly relieved that I was sturdy.</p><br/><p>Also, I was deeply moved when I was able to speak with the wolves.</p><br/><p>Because of reasons, I am the only one that\u2019s able to though.</p><br/><p>Well, wolves are intelligent, so even without speaking, they are able to communicate with their actions.</p><br/><p>They properly give warnings.</p><br/><p>The problem is if the other side complies with those warnings.</p><br/><p>And it seems like the Al-Elemera weren\u2019t able to do that.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I wonder if Ema will forgive them.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if she does, the Al-Elemera will probably not be able to lift their heads to Ema anymore.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that you mention it Shiki, it wasn\u2019t Al-Efemera.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cMy apologies. Remembering the names of something like flying insects, is pretty difficult huh.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>He easily admitted it.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t even try to smooth it over.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though they are feisty, their impression is weak after all.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cSeriously.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, by the way, did you hear the talk about what they said of their forest?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I remember correctly, it was done in by a purple cloud.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know the details?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. It is a big disaster, but it is a phenomenon that happens pretty often in the wastelands. Thick accumulated dark purple clouds bring about strong rain and it fills the land in poison.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>A cloud that rains down poison huh.</p><br/><p>Sounds dangerous.</p><br/><p>I am glad I didn\u2019t encounter that when I was in the wasteland.</p><br/><p>When he says thick and accumulated, does he refer to a form like that of a cumulonimbus cloud?</p><br/><p>If that\u2019s in purple color\u2026it would have quite the intensity.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s troublesome.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is only possible to take refuge, so things like bases that have a set location would be completely wiped out. Just that\u2026\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>Shiki who was explaining, slightly hesitates in saying the next.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust that?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I urge him to continue.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard this from Tomoe-dono, but that purple cloud isn\u2019t actually from the weather; it is actually a living being.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cLiving being? A cloud is?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s hard to believe.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe said they were a group of small gas living beings. Normally, they are not much of a threat, but when it surpasses a set number of them, they grow bigger in a breath and bring about disaster. As expected of someone that has lived a long time, she has quite the vast knowledge.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cA gas living being. As I thought, it just doesn\u2019t ring well.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut being a living being means it has life force, so in other words, I thought that it might be possible to kill them or scatter them.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. It is certainly true that if we kill the living, they will stop.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut well, they are special beings that move in group, so if they are a gas type where each one is as small as a grain, trying to kill them might not be realistic. It doesn\u2019t have much relation to Asora in the first place, so I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much need to research it.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to see it at least once. How about you, Shiki?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cTo tell the truth\u2026I am also interested. There\u2019s a mountain of work to do, so right now I can\u2019t move though.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cHm\u2026in that case, how about asking Tomoe and Mio to bring a sample?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like the two of them are busy as well, so\u2026how about asking the Winged-kin? It seems like they haven\u2019t heard of it, but maybe they will be able to bring new information of it.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected of Shiki. Yeah, let\u2019s try that!\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>If it has an interesting special characteristic, I might be able to use it in the lectures of the Academy.</p><br/><p>In the case that it is hard to utilize, it would be biohazardous, so I will refrain from using it.</p><br/><p>Even if there\u2019s still a brief time before going to Limia, I still have to do the things I can do at Asora and the Academy.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I think that it will be impossible to utilize it in the lectures of the students.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026As expected of Shiki. Wait, since when did you learn to read minds?!\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cGuessing what my master thinks, is a basic skill of a butler; is what Morris-dono said, so I tried learning it.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>It is not \u2018I tried learning it\u2019.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s normally not possible.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are a diligent one, Shiki.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cI am honored.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u2018Maybe I should just throw all the classes in the Academy to Shiki\u2019, is what I slightly thought.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

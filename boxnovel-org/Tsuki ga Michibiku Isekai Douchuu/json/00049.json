When I asked Mio who was the one in charge of them, she pointed at the plants.</p><br/><p>\u201cI asked these children directly. We properly talked out that there won\u2019t be any problems with their propagation-desu wa\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>These children?</p><br/><p>In this world plants can talk too huh. Fumu, this was a blind spot.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo Mio can talk with plants huh. Alchemy, curing, you really have too many hidden specialties\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>It\u2019s to the point that I might mistake her for a surprise box*. </p><br/><p>\u201cEven if I say that I can speak with them, it\u2019s not like I can speak with them clearly. We can exchange our intentions\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd? Will it be able to take root here?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will know that from now on. If it\u2019s no good, we can bring them back to their original place and have Tomoe-san create a barrier\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>If hyumans find them, they would be taken out by the root and they would perish after all, is what she added.</p><br/><p>I think so too. Mio, you really are growing up! I am truly happy!</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, Waka-sama, there is one problem. No, even if I call it a problem, it\u2019s just a petty thing though\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Right now it looks like things are proceeding smoothly though.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt may be self-proclaimed, but there are actually people protecting the ambrosia. This time we took it without telling them, however, I think it would be better to explain them at a later time or it will become troublesome\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 People protecting it?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I see. If that\u2019s the case, they would certainly turn to search for the one responsible. Because depending on their actions, it could turn into Tsige knowing the location of the ambrosia after all.</p><br/><p>If handled poorly, it could even turn into a war between this forest people and Tsige.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s no good.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, judging by the trace, I think that they are from a fairy race. A serious and hard headed race that doesn\u2019t listen to other people\u2019s situation. I don\u2019t know if they will seriously listen to us even if we talk with them\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut if we have the consent of the plants themselves, it shouldn\u2019t become a serious issue, right?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, as I stated previously, it is self-proclaimed-na no desu. As they don\u2019t seem to have any methods to exchange their intentions with these children. They just look over the important plants, and are protecting them, is how it most likely goes\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u2026 As expected, speaking with plants must be a pretty rare skill. The fairy race looks like the type that would be able to talk with trees and grass, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case.</p><br/><p>Finding a plant that is on the verge of extinction and after that we protect it and look after it. We have consent and moreover, we are able to sympathize with them.</p><br/><p>Fairies, fairies huh. Pixies, dryads, if she is saying that they are serious and hard headed, they could even be knockers. If it\u2019s a dryad, it would be the appearance of the first one in my conquest strike zone.</p><br/><p>The people of Tsige are just way too beautiful that I can\u2019t get my hands on them you know~. I\u2019m a good for nothing after all. On top of that, leaving aside the merchants, the adventurers are the problem. From neck to bottom they are so exposed that one has to look twice.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s to the level that even at great subcultural events it would be totally out, a cosplay that would leave you with a ghastly pale look. For women it was poison to the eye and for men it caused you to wanna puke. Either of them made you question their sanity.</p><br/><p>One time, there was a woman that her upper half was practically leaves, there was one who only had a small cloth wrapped around her chest. Moreover, most of them had the lower half dressed as Arabia girls, the order is completely reversed~! Is what I wanted to tsukkomi.</p><br/><p>There are people that have real moving beast ears and elves that have unbelievably slim bodies, and it\u2019s also filled with various race beauties that fulfill all types of tastes walking around. Even the normal beauties are walking with radical attires.</p><br/><p>MO.RE.O.VER!</p><br/><p>Because of my two followers\u2019 high level (I am completely sure this is the reason!), there have been a number of women that have tried seducing me lately!</p><br/><p>When I return to Asora, leaving aside Tomoe, Mio looks at me with an aroused face (it\u2019s probably not my imagination) and there are times when she comes to my room uninvited. Geez, it\u2019s already tiring. Seriously tiring. It\u2019s an important thing so I said\u2026 meh, I don\u2019t care anymore. That\u2019s how tired I am.</p><br/><p>Being trapped in a trauma-like experience with a love confession and become an adult in one go. Losing my gas in a lot of meanings and becoming a sage.</p><br/><p>Yeah, there was a time when I walked to the red-light district filled with brothels.</p><br/><p>That was a mistake. I don\u2019t even want to remember it.</p><br/><p>I was forcefully returned by Tomoe and Mio, and they made a big uproar about who I should embrace. When they began undressing, I silently tried to get out of there, but I was stopped by a pinkish mist that looked like it would not be good for my body and a sticky spider web.</p><br/><p>Even though I was thinking about paying to graduate from my cherry status with no strings attached. To embrace the two that are like relatives, for it to enter that kind of relationship, I honestly felt like it was close to a taboo. Tomoe and Mio are way too close. They cause me so many problems that I feel like they are troublesome sisters.</p><br/><p>Even though they are my companions, followers, our relationship is more close and profound.</p><br/><p>In terms of acquaintances, I have Toa-san that looks exactly like my kohai, and with just that it makes my stomach churn. Even if I lose my reasoning to the point that I would attack any woman that crosses my path, I probably wouldn\u2019t attack Toa-san.</p><br/><p>Honestly, if a woman that looks like Higashi appears as well, I am sure that I would raise a canopy in Asora and become a hikikomori*! </p><br/><p>Right now, there isn\u2019t anyone that I would like to connect my body with. It hurts my heart. It may have been a different story if Tomoe and Mio had separated from me and mobilized by themselves.</p><br/><p>Oh, let\u2019s leave my sex circumstances for now. So I have to give my greetings to the fairies that are supposed to be overlooking the ambrosia, right? Understood.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not like they are bad guys. At any rate, we should meet them and have a talk\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cWon\u2019t it cause troubles to Waka-sama?\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way~ leave it to me. (Maybe I should have just searched for them and ate them. For them to take the time of Waka-sama, such an honor)\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>What, just now, did I hear an incredibly dangerous thought? No, I shouldn\u2019t be able to hear thoughts. Then what is it?</p><br/><p>It must be that. It\u2019s my instincts telling me that leaving this to Mio is dangerous. No doubt about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cMio, isn\u2019t it good to walk out together once in a while?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c!! Together?!\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, together\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I will go! Going out huh*!\u201d (Mio) </p><br/><p>Are you a rascal? What kind of tension is that?</p><br/><p>So, the fairy race huh. What kind of race will they be?</p><br/><p>\u2026 It would be nice if they have a big body and have a maid disposition, furthermore an Ane-sama* type. </p><br/><p>My followers are truly filled with freedom only.</p><br/><p>If there is an Ane-sama type, I would welcome her with open arms.</p><br/><p>No, more importantly.</p><br/><p>\u2026 At this occasion, it would be fine if I put the Ane-sama type as the runner-up condition.</p><br/><p>Not people like Tomoe and Mio that put me as a symbol of adoration, an existence that becomes the counter of those two, I am super looking for someone like that.</p><br/><p>Author Note:</p><br/><p>Mio is, so to speak, dumb.</p><br/><p>That Makoto can\u2019t leisurely put her hands on her is because, saying it bluntly, he is a good for nothing.</p><br/><p>But because she is there, the women around him can\u2019t put a hand on him as well (because she would get in the way). Being blocked, Makoto is in an edgy state that would make him explode at any moment. The person himself doesn\u2019t notice yet that he is being cornered to that extent, and the dangerous gauge is just slowly filling up.</p><br/><p>Well, he is a teenager protagonist. In a not so distant future.</p><br/><p>The development isn\u2019t that fast so in a story sense, it may be distant though. ^^;</p><br/><p>\u201cAre we really leaving the rape part with Tomoe and Mio like that?! I want to know more damn it!\u201d \u2013 Thoughts of a sad adult</p><br/><p>Okay, let me explain. They couldn\u2019t rape him xD. The author himself is telling us that he is in a dangerous state where he is being cockblocked. So I am sure he hasn\u2019t done it yet.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Here I go-desu wa\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Kaleneon.</p><br/><p>The place where there was a small hyuman country in the past.</p><br/><p>Right now, the people that obey Misumi Makoto, no, the representative of Kuzunoha Company, Raidou, were standing at this land.</p><br/><p>Tomoe and Mio were at the lead, and the mamonos were lined up.</p><br/><p>The Highland Orcs and Mist Lizards that lived in the wasteland.</p><br/><p>With a total number that doesn\u2019t even reach the hundreds, they were all completely armed, and when the moonlight shines sometimes, their equipment reflects the light.</p><br/><p>As if acting in concert to Mio\u2019s words, they raised their voices with an: \u201cOooh!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWeb radar and joint link huh. Truly a convenient spell-ja. I can grasp the surroundings as if I were touching it\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Tomoe\u2019s words sounded satisfied.</p><br/><p>It was at the moment Mio linked the perception area with the others.</p><br/><p>Its range is around 20 km.</p><br/><p>Thinking about the area of this time\u2019s plan, this range was plenty enough.</p><br/><p>In essence, her perception area is actually wider, but it seems she judged that it was pointless to link all that area.</p><br/><p>She linked all the area with Tomoe, but she limited the area the Orcs and Mist Lizards received to the space of the strategy.</p><br/><p>Tomoe said it was like a radar, and it is quite the accurate depiction.</p><br/><p>Right now in the units that have come here from Asora, every one of them has a radar manifesting inside their heads.</p><br/><p>They still haven\u2019t made contact, and yet, they completely knew how many enemies there were in the location, and just how their forces were distributed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, this is a night raid. I wonder how much they will struggle\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time, a declaration of war is unnecessary. Because it has \u2018already been done\u2019 after all. In this occasion, Waka\u2019s intentions will be achieved\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I can\u2019t hold back any longer. I will be heading out, excuse me\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Mio?! Can\u2019t be helped huh. I totally feel the same way after all. You guys, I don\u2019t know if I will be able to hold back tonight. Mio will be in charge of the Fortress\u2019 inner part. In that case, I will go secure the gate of Asora. Don\u2019t get close to us for a while\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>When Mio did one step forward, her figure disappears.</p><br/><p>Tomoe confirms the place she is heading to and makes a smile. Then, she turns towards the units.</p><br/><p>To the words and expression filled with fighting spirit that can\u2019t normally be seen in Tomoe, the Orcs and Lizards silently nod.</p><br/><p>While showing an unconcealable fire in their eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone must be feeling the same. Highland Orcs and Mist Lizards, rampage to your heart\u2019s content. It is okay to not pursue the ones escaping. You understand, right? In context, this a war between Kaleneon and the demon race-ja\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Cutting her words, Tomoe inhales.</p><br/><p>Thrusting her unsheathed katana to the sky, she gathers everyone\u2019s will.</p><br/><p>\u201cA war dedicated to Waka-ja! Everyone that opposes! Completely! Trample them down!!\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>As soon as she finishes her speech, Tomoe kicks the ground, and in the moment she reaches mid-air, she was enveloped by mist and disappeared.</p><br/><p>Immediately following that, a war cry resonated in the whole region.</p><br/><p>With excess vigor, a blaze of many colors shine in the sky.</p><br/><p>This is the deed of the Mist Lizards.</p><br/><p>This was the beginning of the war, no, of the genocide.</p><br/><p>With a force that can\u2019t be called a big army at all, they shouted a thunderous roar that made the ground tremble as they march.</p><br/><p>Their aim is a part of a town that has been repaired and utilized as a fortress. The stronghold that pertains Kaleneon.</p><br/><p>From what Tomoe investigated, there are around two thousand demons stationed in that place.</p><br/><p>They are not tempered enough to be in the frontlines, but as an army, they are a force in a level plenty enough to stand in battle.</p><br/><p>They were distracted by Mio who had already begun rampaging, but when they noticed the group of mixed mamonos, with a reaction slightly slower than usual, they began preparing.</p><br/><p>At nigh time the gate was already closed, and they apply a defensive enhance to it. Immediately after, the archer and magician units position themselves at the outer walls and grasp the position of the enemy.</p><br/><p>They commence their attack on them.</p><br/><p>Their moves were not bad.</p><br/><p>If taking into consideration that Mio is rampaging within, it can be considered a reaction speed worthy of praise.</p><br/><p>However\u2026</p><br/><p>Their enemy was too much.</p><br/><p>What they are currently facing are crazy fellows that have been living in the world\u2019s border as if it were only natural, moreover, they have been trained by a Supreme Dragon, the Black Calamity Spider, and also demi-humans. Of course, the defense unit has no way of knowing this.</p><br/><p>They in itself are formidable enemies, and yet, right now their morale is at their climax.</p><br/><p>It isn\u2019t something they can deal with.</p><br/><p>Actually, if they were to teleport with the help of Tomoe or Mio, they would have been able to fight from the inside as well.</p><br/><p>But the Orcs and Lizards wished to fight right from the front.</p><br/><p>Everything was for the sake of showing their power to this distant land, about the power of their Lord.</p><br/><p>For them, Kaleneon is an offering.</p><br/><p>The arrows and spells that were fired towards them were all thwarted.</p><br/><p>Not even a rock could reach.</p><br/><p>\u2013Something is wrong.</p><br/><p>By the time the defense unit noticed the strangeness of the situation, it was already too late.</p><br/><p>The attackers moved.</p><br/><p>\u201cGO!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOoooh!\u201d</p><br/><p>A large-builded Orc roars with a giant mace in hand.</p><br/><p>Being ordered by the delicate-looking magician female orc, the Giant Orc kicks the ground.</p><br/><p>That body radiated a red luminescence, and as if being pushed forward, he soared the sky.</p><br/><p>The one who valiantly ordered this, was Ema.</p><br/><p>She was currently showing the face of a warrior, something that no one would be able to imagine from the girl that normally does deskwork.</p><br/><p>Applying a specially dense enhancing magic to the warrior that plunged in, she again blocks the attacks from the outer walls.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is the fortification of the defensive wall?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSufficient! After placing another layer, we will soon be able to shift to defense\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. First we will begin by crushing those Orcs!\u201d</p><br/><p>The charge of an Orc that was in the units.</p><br/><p>Understanding the reason why he was trying to plunge onto the gate, the demons immediately react.</p><br/><p>\u201cOoooh!! Like hell they will stop me!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Drawing a parabola, the Highland Orc suddenly draws closer to the gate.</p><br/><p>Holding the mace that looks giant even when in the hands of the big-builded orc, he brandishes it.</p><br/><p>Without showing any signs of breaking his stance, he smashes that one attack onto the gates.</p><br/><p>A specially loud sound, as if a lightning fell, resounded in the Fortress at night.</p><br/><p>In the smoke that ascends, a big shadow rises.</p><br/><p>Smoke was rising from the Orc\u2019s body as well.</p><br/><p>The solid gate protecting the fortress was already turned into a miserable wreckage.</p><br/><p>They most likely thought that it would be best to attack the Orc while his vision was still not clear. Several shadows commence their attack.</p><br/><p>It seems several lights from inside the fortress served as illumination.</p><br/><p>The result was a tragedy.</p><br/><p>The mace was quickly swung horizontally.</p><br/><p>All the shadows were thrown to the opposite direction with good momentum.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t underestimate the pigs of the wasteland. Don\u2019t lower your guard, do your best. There are plenty behind me that are a lot stronger than me! If you guys are weak, we can\u2019t show our best you know!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOn my lead!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let them have their way! To let this no-names do any further than this\u2013!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are just Orcs and Lizardmen. On top of that, there\u2019s not even a hundred of them!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The troops of Asora flood into the fortress.</p><br/><p>It doesn\u2019t even reach the hundreds.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s exactly right.</p><br/><p>Normally, Orcs and Lizardmen are not that much of a high standing among the demon race army.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s exactly right.</p><br/><p>In the lands that are under the rule of the demon race, no one would imagine that strong troops originating from the wasteland would be attacking them.</p><br/><p>Therefore\u2026</p><br/><p>Their utmost resistance was being trampled down.</p><br/><p>The morale that the people of Asora emit hasn\u2019t shown any signs of weakening.</p><br/><p>The two thousand soldiers protecting the fortress were being challenged by an enemy of less than a hundred, moreover, they are dispersed.</p><br/><p>Because of Mio\u2019s favour, the Lizardmen that are able to accurately grasp the enemy\u2019s\u2019 position and situation, divided in groups of 3, which is the smallest configuration they have, and were tearing down their foes.</p><br/><p>It was nothing other than reckless.</p><br/><p>If Makoto were to give an impression of this fight, it would be that this is a battle that disregards strategy.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a difference in number of troops that normally wouldn\u2019t even be able to break down the gate.</p><br/><p>But even so\u2026</p><br/><p>The fortress\u2019 gate was opened, and the warrior that opened it, taunted the two thousand that were there.</p><br/><p>All the troops of Asora understood the situation of the battle.</p><br/><p>They knew that Mio had already arrived at a place that has a big reaction, and Tomoe is heading to her target location at an incredible speed.</p><br/><p>Every single one of them led the way and placed strength in their fists.</p><br/><p>For the demon race, this nightmare-like fight had just begun.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u201cAra, I am sorry for Tomoe-san but, it seems I drew a winner-desu wa\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 If I asked who are you, woman, would you answer?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. My name is Mio. And you?\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I am one of the soldiers under the rule of Demon Lord-sama. Is there any need to know more?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t know your name, I won\u2019t be able to report who I did what to. It would be troublesome\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Mio pleasantly laughs while responding the man.</p><br/><p>In the inside of the fortress, at a space where it was most likely used as a big meeting room.</p><br/><p>At this place, she met what the bunch at this place would call: \u2018the strongest amongst them\u2019.</p><br/><p>His upper half is close to that of a hyuman, but his lower half is that of a serpent.</p><br/><p>He had presence, and power can he sensed from him as well.</p><br/><p>Wanting to defeat the biggest game to report to her master Makoto, in Mio\u2019s eyes he was the most suitable game.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis one\u2019s name is Reft. A variant dragon, Mildi Dragon Reft\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAra, a mutation of the dragon race. How rare. I thought you were a snake\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said your name was Mio, right? Without even a declaration of war, just what in the world are you bastards? A force that commands Orcs and Lizards. I can\u2019t think of it as a hyuman army\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUfufufu\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Mio was truly in a good mood.</p><br/><p>So happy, so happy, so ever happy.</p><br/><p>Even when she understands that she is in the battlefield, she can\u2019t stop her face from smiling widely.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t even intend to answer huh. Sorry but, that I was here was unlucky of you guys. I will have to crush you\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I will offer you the answer-desu wa\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201c?!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have already finished declaring war. No, you guys were the ones who declared war upon us, you know?\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 What?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are Kaleneon. The ones that should leave this country are you demon race-desu wa\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cKale-neon, you say? The hyuman country that was here before? Are you saying you guys are an army from a ruined country?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. Kaleneon has not fallen. It has always been here\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Are you crazy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Reft made a dubious face at Mio\u2019s entranced way of talking.</p><br/><p>From his point of view it was natural, since Mio was acting as if she were under the effects of a drug.</p><br/><p>\u201cFufufu. \u2018That\u2019 will become the truth, from now on. By our hands\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Mio continued without changing her behavior and way of speaking.</p><br/><p>Even if it wasn\u2019t Reft, anyone would have felt madness from it.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll the land until Stella Fort, is land under our control. This Kaleneon is also one of the lands the demon race possesses! I am not free enough to accompany you in your nonsense!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 That\u2019s why it is convenient-desu yo. Hyumans won\u2019t believe much of what you guys say after all. Even if one obscure country wasn\u2019t destroyed\u2026 no one would be able to deny it. If the country in itself was truly there, that is\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cWh-at?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2013Is what she said. Honestly, I don\u2019t understand well myself. I actually don\u2019t care about those kind of matters. I will deal with you, and offer this land to Waka-sama. That is the only most important thing. No matter if this place was Kaleneon, or a place that continued being Kaleneon; I don\u2019t care whichever one it is-desu wa\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 you guys, just what are you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s begin\u2019, is what Mio says as she holds her folding fan and points it at Reft.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like I can\u2019t simply kill you. Because I still have things I have to ask you\u201d</p><br/><p>Reft turns his giant spear at Mio.</p><br/><p>His half-hyuman, half-snake body twists.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you are able to win against me, do as you wish. Ufufu, the gate has been broken huh. It seems like they are also doing their best to offer victory to Waka-sama. Of course, today, in this very day, there\u2019s not a single one in our forces that are unable to do that though\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cThis pressure is\u2026 not something a simple lunatic group is able to exude. To think that I would have to do this kind of battle before meeting the hero\u201d</p><br/><p>The variant dragon, Reft.</p><br/><p>One of the demon generals that was at this fortress by chance.</p><br/><p>An upper echelon of the demon race.</p><br/><p>While receiving the blood thirst with her body, Mio narrowed her eyes and laughed.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u201cI see\u201d</p><br/><p>Outskirts of the imperial capital.</p><br/><p>The woman that had obtained several amounts of data, crumpled that paper into a ball and threw it onto the table.</p><br/><p>Blue skin and no horn.</p><br/><p>Wearing a tight suit, she has an exaggerated coat on her shoulders.</p><br/><p>One of the demon generals, Rona.</p><br/><p>Even if she is in the outskirts, she is still inside the imperial capital.</p><br/><p>The exaggerated coat is something that is only provided to demons in the upper echelons.</p><br/><p>To wear that in the capital of hyumans is pretty dangerous.</p><br/><p>Even so, Rona paid it no mind, and with no impatience, she stayed sitting in the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood work. I have no right to say this but you know, Rona, you are pretty daring\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSofia. I don\u2019t mind you rampaging as you wish you know? With your power, you should be able to stir trouble even without encountering the hero after all. Also, you easily slaughtered the so called treasured corps of the Empire, right? Keep going that way\u201d (Rona)</p><br/><p>Rona glances at Sofia and the boy that entered the room along with her, and then turns her eyes towards her documents again.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey showed no resistance. I came to hear Rona\u2019s: \u2018I see\u2019. I was interested in the reason for this weird dispersed attack which I don\u2019t know if you even have the intention to attack or not\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there plenty enough casualties appearing from the Empire\u2019s army? We have sufficient intent to attack. Don\u2019t worry about it. Also, Sofia, and Lancer as well. Isn\u2019t it bad to show yourselves in the imperial capital? The unit here is being pushed back, so I would be grateful if you provided backing though\u201d (Rona)</p><br/><p>\u201cAt the beginning that\u2019s how we did it. Using a unit that seemed to be close to wipe out as bait, we get them in a pincer attack and crush them. I thought this was that kind of strategy. But that\u2019s not it, right? Rona has thrown away quite the amount of units before. We are not subordinates but collaborators, so I would like you to share information you know~\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Fuh~ The strategy huh. Well, for the time being, you two are under my care. If you are collaborators, cooperate in making the strategy proceed smoothly\u201d (Rona)</p><br/><p>\u201cSo she says, Mitsurugi\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>\u201cWords that chip away my motivation. To hear those kind of words from the person in charge itself makes it even more so\u201d (Lancer)</p><br/><p>The faces of Sofia and Lancer were showing clear dissatisfaction as they look at Rona.</p><br/><p>The female gestures and that playful behavior Rona used when she was confronting Makoto, were nowhere to be found.</p><br/><p>With cold eyes and a strict expression, she organized the information that came up and was looking at the situation of the war, but she temporarily stopped reading the documents.</p><br/><p>Maintaining her face as a commander, she looks at the two collaborators.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Empire\u2019s hero has a two-sided nature. At times he will become aggressive, and at others he will show caution. And those two sides are switching no matter what type of plan we use. I thought that it would be best to understand the reason of this, since I felt that this would prove beneficial later on. So I have been concentrating the investigation mainly on this point. Other than that, I wanted to know the strength of the cherished force the Empire was raising. In that point, you two easily brought them out and, even if it was only one corp, you wiped them out. You were a great help. Thanks to you both, I think I will be able to make some countermeasures. How is that, is this enough? Let me tell you this, you owe me one with this, okay?\u201d (Rona)</p><br/><p>\u201cI see~. Open as many drawers from the Empire as possible, is what you are trying to say. Hmph, well well. That corp wasn\u2019t a big deal anyways. Even if it wasn\u2019t me, things would have managed somehow. They were unbalanced and left a lot of openings after all\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>\u201cI was worried that the adventurer system would interfere, but there were no problems. Now that I fish out and see, this is indeed one of the special traits of a hero. It may have been troublesome if this were to reach the ears of the Kingdom, but fortunately, they hold no proof. At that side Io is going at it seriously, so they are done for anyways\u201d (Rona)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems that girl\u2019s party has broken free of the level restrain. It was eerie to see high leveled soldiers being mass produced, but even if their levels are high~\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>\u201cRona, if you say we owe you, you should talk about that two-sided nature of the hero you speak of, right? Don\u2019t worry, I have a proper collateral prepared already\u201d (Lancer)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 How unpleasant\u201d (Rona)</p><br/><p>Rona looks at the boy with heartfelt unpleasantness.</p><br/><p>Both of them don\u2019t even differentiate the things that can and can\u2019t be said.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not that they pursue without knowing. They pursue while knowing.</p><br/><p>An extraordinarily bad personality there.</p><br/><p>It is also because Rona doesn\u2019t trust them at all.</p><br/><p>Even if she has to admit their skills, she can\u2019t trust her back to them.</p><br/><p>As long as she can\u2019t be sure that their interests match, she didn\u2019t want to make them participate in important strategies, is how she truly felt.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why, instead of having them participate in the Limia capital plan, she had both of them act at the Empire where Rona herself can keep a check in their actions.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Empire\u2019s hero, Iwahashi Tomoki, is a hero that is equipped with anti-army equipment. Maneuverability of a flying dragon, defensive power of a royal guard, a golem-user alchemist; the type that uses diversions and boosts in several aspects to avoid the opponent from drawing closer. It may look like force-pushing, but he actually thinks relatively well\u201d (Rona)</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about such a regular assessment though\u201d (Lancer)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Got it. What we understood from this time\u2019s strategy was the peculiarity of this switch of his. He is probably changing his fighting style depending if it\u2019s day or night, in a more specific way, the lunar phase. Probably the time of the moon. Just in the nights, he gains some sort of strong healing power, is what I think\u201d (Rona)</p><br/><p>\u201cA healing power that only activates at night?\u201d (Lancer)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I have heard of no such thing though. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a mistake there. That\u2019s why, if we are going to corner him, it would be best if it were at noon. I think it would be best to continue the strategy by avoiding the nights or letting them pass\u201d (Rona)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 In other words, he is stronger at night, right?\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the conclusion, yeah. It is clear that he is using high powered skills and making bolder moves mostly at night. Lancer, what is the collateral?\u201d (Rona)</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, right. Princess Lily is returning. Accurately speaking, she has already begun giving orders from several towns away of the town of Robin she was in\u201d (Lancer)</p><br/><p>\u201c?!! Are you speaking the truth?!\u201d (Rona)</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. This is certain\u201d (Lancer)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Tch, so she is already moving. It depends on what happened to Rotsgard though. If that woman has returned, it is unnecessary to stay here for long. We have already achieved our objective anyways. After this, it would be enough to just go from the back huh. A step faster towards Stella\u201d (Rona)</p><br/><p>Nervousness appeared in Rona\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>It was information that changed the situation of the war greatly.</p><br/><p>It was definitely information that she couldn\u2019t speak of even if negotiated.</p><br/><p>\u2018As I thought, I can\u2019t trust these two\u2019, is what Rona reaffirmed.</p><br/><p>Just like what the saying says \u2018Can\u2019t see the forest for the trees\u2019, Rona was giving orders inside the capital itself.</p><br/><p>She swiftly burned the documents and headed to the entrance of the room.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 What are both of you doing? We are returning\u201d (Rona)</p><br/><p>\u201cFufu, I have received good information. With this, the return is just not enough right, Mitsurugi?\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>\u201cSofia, people like you are just\u2026\u201d (Lancer)</p><br/><p>Rona tilts her head at both Sofia and Lancer who she thought would be accompanying her, but were not showing signs of moving.</p><br/><p>\u201cRona, I will give you a bit of service. You should cross the river and go to the safe sphere. I will\u2026 go play with the hero for a bit\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>\u201c?! Lady, were you listening to what I said?! At nights we don\u2019t know his strength accurately, you know?! Even if we seal his powers with the ring, he is currently only using weapons that are suited for him, so it doesn\u2019t have much effect. In the past we would have been able to crush him with just this much, but in the current state\u2026\u201d (Rona)</p><br/><p>\u201cI will leave the thought transmission open, so shut up. If you go as far as saying all this, I won\u2019t be able to stop anymore. I wonder if every person that has connections with the Goddess ends up like \u2018that person\u2019. I am looking forward to it\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>Sofia was emitting a blood thirst from her whole body which she wasn\u2019t even trying to hide.</p><br/><p>In the latter half, she muttered as if talking to herself and felt like it wasn\u2019t for anyone to hear.</p><br/><p>Just who is \u2018that person\u2019?</p><br/><p>There\u2019s only one other person that knows this.</p><br/><p>After Lancer makes a small sigh, he disappears along with Sofia.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, wait\u2014 Just how difficult they are to deal with! But if Princess Lily is returning, staying here would be dangerous. No choice but to return huh. If she were to just die off, the variables would decrease\u201d (Rona)</p><br/><p>Without chasing after the two, Rona leaves the building.</p><br/><p>She is not disguising herself. She was in her natural demon form.</p><br/><p>She must have judged that it was unnecessary to do so.</p><br/><p>Without turning back, she blows up the building that was there and activates the previously set-up teleportal, escaping to the outsides of the capital.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

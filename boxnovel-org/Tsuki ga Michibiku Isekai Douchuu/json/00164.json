This thought had occurred to me earlier in Limia as well.</p><br/><p>I mean, look.</p><br/><p>The Green Berets, the Spetsnaz, the Australian commandos, COBRA, the CIA, the KGB, MI6, the FBI...</p><br/><p>TLN: The Green Berets are the US army special forces. The Spetsnaz are the Russian special forces. COBRA is the UK government\u2019s special meeting, held when there is a national crisis. Hopefully the rest are self-explanatory.</p><br/><p>Err, I think my list is slowly changing as I go.</p><br/><p>Anyway.</p><br/><p>When you see those really amazing-looking armed forces or special intelligence organizations on television or in movies, you get the feeling they have amazing military power, right?</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a good thing that there weren\u2019t any casualties, so let\u2019s just be happy that I was wrong in my expectations.</p><br/><p>Even the injuries were mild, like a Lizard\u2019s tail being stomped by a Highland Orc.</p><br/><p>\u300cI wonder if Shiki is alright.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>I received an explanation that I didn't really understand, saying that the enemy\u2019s general was a strangely glossy, palm-sized dragon that Mio showed me.</p><br/><p>TLN: \u201cDragon\u201d is more or less equivalent to \u201cserpent\u201d here, referring to the enemy general's body shape \u2013 The Japanese term \u201d/ryuu\u201d tends to be used for Chinese dragons, which are more serpent-like.</p><br/><p>Tomoe also mentioned that there were cliffs instead of national borders.</p><br/><p>However.</p><br/><p>An interruption prevented them from reporting any further.</p><br/><p>As a report on what happened on our side, Shiki explained that we engaged Sofia and Lancer and finished them. He did this with a happy expression that didn\u2019t even try to conceal his sense of accomplishment.</p><br/><p>Tomoe and Mio\u2019s presence suddenly became restless, though their expressions remained the same.</p><br/><p>As Shiki was about to go into an explanation about our contact with the demons and details about the goddess\u2019s power, Tomoe put a hand on his shoulder and Mio seized his hand.</p><br/><p>They both demanded a detailed explanation.</p><br/><p>And then the two of them took him away for a discussion \u2013 no, an evaluation meeting \u2013 and I haven\u2019t seen him since.</p><br/><p>In the end, Ema had to take over. I was grateful for her summary of events, then I dismissed the rest of Asora.</p><br/><p>So that everyone could rest, we decided to hold the victory celebration that Ema suggested the next day.</p><br/><p>In other words, it\u2019s tonight.</p><br/><p>Right now Ema\u2019s tired so she might still be sleeping, but someone has probably taken command and started making preparations for the party.</p><br/><p>But I can\u2019t do that.</p><br/><p>In fact, the battle we fought last night was an irregular one. We\u2019re supposed to be finishing off the mutants in Rotsgard today.</p><br/><p>\u300cThough I think it\u2019s odd to call them mutants after fighting Io and Sofia. I\u2019m still sleepy~\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>Even so, I have to go to the academy in the morning.</p><br/><p>That means that I can sleep for only another one or two hours.</p><br/><p>Rona said something that worried me too, and I\u2019m thinking that the demons might have had something to do with the mutants that gathered in the wealthy district.</p><br/><p>It seemed like there might be demi-humans living in Rotsgard that are on the demons\u2019 side.</p><br/><p>Hyumans or demons.</p><br/><p>Now that I think about it, I don\u2019t know which side demi-humans would choose.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s actually strange to think that they would fight against the demons without any conditions.</p><br/><p>Since, except for the few that are being treated well, demi-humans aren't seen as people by hyumans.</p><br/><p>In that case, even if there was a merit system, there would be those that think that the demons are better, since they give them rights.</p><br/><p>Not to mention that up until now, the demons only had cold, frozen lands. So there are probably demi-humans who had no choice but to approach hyumans so that they could live properly.</p><br/><p>When I saw that army... This thought occurred to me on the other side, too, but I honestly think that the Demon Lord is an amazing person.</p><br/><p>*Knock knock.*</p><br/><p>Hmm?</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah, come in.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cGood morning, Master.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh it\u2019s you, Lime. Good morn\u2013\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cSorry for bothering you so early in the morning. I was sent from the academy to come and get you immediately. You should go to the academy ahead of time.\u300d(Lime)</p><br/><p>\u300cIs everyone there already?\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>If I recall, Lime was supposed to regroup with Mondo and the dwarves at the academy.</p><br/><p>But he came to wake me up.</p><br/><p>\u300cYes. It seems the headmaster wishes to clean up already. Also... It is astounding that he is saying this so late, but it seems he wishes for to pretend that we and the Master acted at his request.\u300d(Lime)</p><br/><p>Ahaha...</p><br/><p>It is quite late to be saying that.</p><br/><p>\u300cAnd... The important lecturers wish for you to say that in this incident, your actions were performed under their orders, which they gave to protect the people.\u300d(Lime)</p><br/><p>They\u2019re all idiots.</p><br/><p>In any case, listening to both of these requests is... impossible.</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that exactly what they said?\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cYes.\u300d(Lime)</p><br/><p>As if Lime knows what I want to say, he nods.</p><br/><p>\u300cIf I had to pick, I\u2019d say the headmaster\u2019s one is better. I\u2019ll talk to Shiki and decide later. At any rate, I\u2019d like to spend my first day or two doing as I like before I have to go to the academy.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cAs you say. By the way, Master.\u300d(Lime)</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat?\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cThere was a woman outside your room. Someone loitering around the shelter?\u300d(Lime)</p><br/><p>But there is no woman there now.</p><br/><p>As he describes her features to me, I realize that he\u2019s talking about the ane-san* who has been coming to talk to me about things on her mind ever since I saved her at the brothel.</p><br/><p>TLN*: Term to refer to a woman somewhat older than you</p><br/><p>If I recall, her name is Ester-san.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, no, it\u2019s a person I brought to the shelter. I guess she\u2019s the one I\u2019ve talked to the most among the hyumans here. I wonder what she wants.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cShe disappeared after I gave her a single glance, so it must not have been anything important. I ended up imagining something indecent, thinking that she had surely spent the night here, hehe.\u300d(Lime)</p><br/><p>\u300c... Spare me. Don\u2019t think that you\u2019re the norm, when you\u2019re so popular with the Gorgons.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300c... Too much of anything is a poison*. But I think you, Master, should learn to enjoy yourself more.\u300d(Lime)</p><br/><p>TLN*: A Japanese phrase equivalent to the English one: \u201cYou can have too much of a good thing\u201d, or however that phrase goes.</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah, yeah. Well then, shall we go to the academy?\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cIs Shiki-san not coming?\u300d(Lime)</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ve been trying to reach him with telepathy since a little earlier, but he\u2019s not replying. He seemed pretty tired, too, so I was thinking that you could come with me, Lime.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cWith pleasure. Also, please accept my belated congratulations on your safe return.\u300d(Lime)</p><br/><p>\u300c... Tomoe. She\u2019s done it again.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>I wondered why Lime already knew, but I realize that Tomoe has probably been going around explaining to everyone.</p><br/><p>Or it might have been Mio.</p><br/><p>How is it that Lime knows, even though he never shows his face here in Asora?</p><br/><p>\u300cThe merchants\u2019 guild, the Lizards from the arena and the Arke were worried. They thought that we might have failed over here.\u300d(Lime)</p><br/><p>\u300cIt wasn\u2019t really a success or a failure... Ah, tonight\u2019s the celebration. You can drink as much as you want as well. Since I don\u2019t think there\u2019ll be any left tomorrow.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>Now I\u2019ll go to the academy and take care of things there.</p><br/><p>Maybe I\u2019ll go and make a complaint to Root while I\u2019m at it.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6</p><br/><p>To summarize.</p><br/><p>The demon collaborators that Rona mentioned are nowhere to be seen.</p><br/><p>But there are three mutants that are all bigger than Io.</p><br/><p>With bodies over four meters tall, they\u2019re rampaging and destroying a part of the city.</p><br/><p>It seems that they have the ability to fuse.</p><br/><p>Although, they aren\u2019t like \u201cgachiin\u201d, they\u2019re more like \u201cgucho... gucho.\u201d</p><br/><p>TLN: These are onomatopoeias, so I can\u2019t really translate them in any other way... I believe that the \u201cgachiin\u201d refers to the metallic, mechanical sound of the fusions between mechas (like in Guren Lagann, if you\u2019ve watched that). \u201cGucho gucho\u201d is more like a squishy sound. Therefore, this sentence is emphasizing that it\u2019s a biological fusion rather than a mechanical one.</p><br/><p>And in the end, it was decided that the ones who have to deal with it aren\u2019t the academy\u2019s army, but the Kuzunoha company.</p><br/><p>The academy\u2019s army, who were easily cleaning up the remaining mutants, were completely defeated by these mutants that have become resistant to all attributes.</p><br/><p>But the damage from no-attribute magic wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up with their regeneration, so it just became a wasted effort.</p><br/><p>They've retreated, scattering like baby spiders, and now we\u2019re left standing here.</p><br/><p>Haah...</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, you don\u2019t have to do anything, Shiki. You can just sleep.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cI cannot allow that. For waka-sama to be working while I do nothing.\u300d(Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, no, I\u2019m not going to do anything either. Let\u2019s leave it to the others, since it\u2019s such a pain.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>Since Lime and Mondo are here, too.</p><br/><p>Shiki somehow regrouped with our suppression force, but he looks even more exhausted than I am.</p><br/><p>I have no doubt that he hasn\u2019t slept.</p><br/><p>He might have been in a coma, though.</p><br/><p>When I was told to secure the surroundings and left out of the main suppression force, I was actually happy inside.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, we will go.\u300d(Mondo)</p><br/><p>Lime and Mondo take a step forward.</p><br/><p>\u300cWe wish for you to leave this one to us. Since we did come all this way with our weapons ready.\u300d(Lime)</p><br/><p>Even the Eldwa workers look ready to fight, holding an axe whose height far exceeds their own.</p><br/><p>If you were to ask me to describe how big the axe is, its handle is so long that it appears as if the axe is walking on its own.</p><br/><p>They can\u2019t walk around the city unless they hold the axe straight up.</p><br/><p>But it\u2019s not causing any problems in a situation like this, so I won\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>\u300cSo Lime and Mondo take down two of them, and the Eldwas can take the other. Good luck!\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cNow then... We\u2019ll kill it in one blow with our first attack. Let\u2019s go!\u300d</p><br/><p>There are three dwarves.</p><br/><p>The one in the middle holds the axe on his shoulder as he points at the mutant\u2019s right side, and they all charge in.</p><br/><p>... Last night\u2019s discussion, they heard it too.</p><br/><p>The tension\u2019s so high.</p><br/><p>\u300cEh? Where\u2019s Lime and Mondo?\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cMaster. The Tree Punishment will be fine, correct?\u300d(Lime)</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, I see. You\u2019re right, shall we prepare a new symbol for the city\u2019s revival? Two trees lined up. It might be a nice addition to our new special products for Rotsgard.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, sir.\u300d(Lime)</p><br/><p>\u300cMhmm, you can do what you want. Lime, the enemy is big, so you know what to do, right?\u300d(Mondo)</p><br/><p>\u300cOf course. It won\u2019t even take three minutes. Are you ready, Mondo? Wait, you\u2019re already going in?!\u300d(Lime)</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t be so slow, Lime! They\u2019re just slowpokes with large bodies, but somehow, facing such large opponents gets me quite excited!\u300d(Mondo)</p><br/><p>Lime and Mondo are lively, too.</p><br/><p>Normally, I wouldn\u2019t think that it\u2019s an opponent that Mondo could use Tree Punishment on by himself.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s huge, and because the enemies are fused together, their combined resistance is unusually high.</p><br/><p>But if Lime\u2019s here.</p><br/><p>Before long.</p><br/><p>Its large body is wrapped in light.</p><br/><p>Lime specializes in enhancing the power of others.</p><br/><p>Though there are a lot of athletes who play sports doubles and are proficient at drawing out their teammate\u2019s ability.</p><br/><p>Lime uses that concept as his special ability.</p><br/><p>To compare this ability to opposing mirrors* is an exaggeration, but he strengthens and amplifies power.</p><br/><p>TLN*: If you have two opposing mirrors, you get a seemingly infinite image, and you might consider this as some kind of \u201camplification\u201d, and Lime\u2019s power is compared to this effect here. It doesn\u2019t make all too much sense to me, but maybe it makes more sense if you\u2019re Japanese.</p><br/><p>For example, if he teams up with Mondo.</p><br/><p>To a certain extent, when Mondo is trying to defeat an enemy with one use of Tree Punishment, Lime allows it to work on some opponents that would normally resist it.</p><br/><p>Known as the Aquarius combo, the two of them have good compatibility.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a clever ability that\u2019s useful in any situation.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a power that suits him, since he\u2019s such a helpful person.</p><br/><p>While I was thinking about this, two large trees have already been added to the city.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s pretty amazing.</p><br/><p>They\u2019re not just four meters tall.</p><br/><p>They\u2019re definitely tall enough to become a landmark of academy city.</p><br/><p>\u300cKaratakewariiiiii!\u300d</p><br/><p>TLN: The literal translation for \u201ckaratakewari\u201d is \u201cbamboo splitter/divider\u201d. It\u2019s actually the name of a martial art technique where you perform a knife-hand chop that strikes the head.</p><br/><p>Oh.</p><br/><p>And at the moment the Eldwas drop the axe \u2013 no, the huge axe that has somehow grown even bigger \u2013 on the other mutant\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>That mutant.</p><br/><p>Splits cleanly in two.</p><br/><p>The Karatakewari strikes the head perfectly.</p><br/><p>Wait, that axe can grow even larger than its original size?</p><br/><p>It seems like a weapon that\u2019s really limited in what enemies it can be used against.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t think it could be used in one-on-one fights.</p><br/><p>During the long time the Eldwas spent living in seclusion, it seems they went and created a weapon I don\u2019t really understand.</p><br/><p>But there\u2019s no regenerating from that.</p><br/><p>As I look at the mutant that was split in half, I see its insides bubbling and swelling up.</p><br/><p>Ah, they defeated it.</p><br/><p>Huh?!</p><br/><p>\u300cWait, it can\u2019t be...\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>I had a bad feeling, and I was right.</p><br/><p>It bursts open, and the contents fall like rain down towards the city...</p><br/><p>\u300cGood grief, now the city is going to be covered in a foul smell, isn\u2019t it. Never mind the center, but at least the parts of the city where it\u2019s landing.\u300d(Shiki)</p><br/><p>Although Shiki is tired, he\u2019s created huge magic circles overhead, slightly above the height of the buildings.</p><br/><p>Not just one, but several of them in three dimensions, and the sky is covered with them.</p><br/><p>I guess they form a spherical shape.</p><br/><p>\u300cAmazing, what a sight.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cNot at all, I\u2019m just using a weak power to burn up the raining matter; this technique was originally made to incinerate areas of land. I put up several of them and just altered how it looks.\u300d(Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, thanks to that, the city doesn\u2019t have to take a mutant shower.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cTo swing that axe around without thinking. Those Eldwas must be punished later, as well.\u300d(Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u300cAs well?\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300c...\u300d(Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u300cAs well, Shiki?\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cWaka-sama, please do not say it twice.\u300d(Shiki)</p><br/><p>Shiki is trembling delicately.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s not touch on that any deeper, then.</p><br/><p>At any rate, we\u2019re finished now.</p><br/><p>Now once the academy finishes surveying the area and declares an end to the state of emergency, the city will be restored to normal and be calm again.</p><br/><p>... I really don\u2019t get the sense that there was a battle here.</p><br/><p>I stare at the huge trees, whose bright green leaves I can see swaying even from here.</p><br/><p>I wonder whether those are evergreen trees.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

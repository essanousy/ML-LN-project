It refers to the people that are called the ancestors of the currently existing adventurers.</p><br/><p>They travelled through the whole world and helped out the people, and became the role model for the brave that came after. Of hyumans and demi-humans alike.</p><br/><p>However, their names currently remain only in a small part of the Lorel Union.</p><br/><p>Why is that? That kind of question popped.</p><br/><p>Just like how Rokuya-san said about it not being anything hide about, he spoke about it fluently.</p><br/><p>But he also said that this is not something we need to talk about in a room filled with people, so he began the talk after guiding us to a space that seemed to be a secret room in this floor.</p><br/><p>When we entered the room, I felt something strange, as if we passed through a thin film. It was something slight that doesn\u2019t warrant much attention though.</p><br/><p>It is probably something to make it so that even if we were to come here on our own, we won\u2019t be able to find it or won\u2019t be able to enter it.</p><br/><p>Well, let\u2019s leave aside the topic of the hidden room for now.</p><br/><p>I am still half in doubt, but it seems like this Rokuya is actually the one from the legendary Adventurers of Origin.</p><br/><p>In other words, immortal.</p><br/><p>It is not that they are always awake and active, they live in a style where they wake up every now and then and move, and have been living like that for a long time.</p><br/><p>Honestly speaking, I wouldn\u2019t be able to imagine a life like that.</p><br/><p>At this moment, I felt like Rokuya-san and the other people called the Adventurers of Origin are existences I wouldn\u2019t be able to comprehend.</p><br/><p>Living for eternity.</p><br/><p>How does that feel?</p><br/><p>If I were forced to choose between death or immortality, the current me would probably\u2026choose death.</p><br/><p>If it were longevity, it would be a different story, but immortality\u2026</p><br/><p>Even if I become immortal, my surroundings will definitely continue dying.</p><br/><p>I kind of don\u2019t like that.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, and so, we ended up cooperating, and that guy Munemori not only got the trust of Root, he even married her, and founded one of the nations that would be counted as one of the five major powers, Elysion.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s still quite a lot of anecdotes remaining about the foundation of Elysion, and the dragon princess that appears in those, I could somewhat understand that it referred to Root from the talks the person himself told me, but\u2026there was no mention about Apfel(Apple), you know?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>By the way, this is my first time hearing that his husband was a person named Sou Mamoru.</p><br/><p>If I remember correctly, he was a swordsman.</p><br/><p>And after building up his country, he began liking love affairs.</p><br/><p>\u2026I feel like this part of his subtly overlaps with Tomoki.</p><br/><p>But well, there was no information regarding charm, and Root said his husband didn\u2019t have those kind of powers.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, we were erased from history after all.\u201d</p><br/><p>In those days, it seems Rokuya-san\u2019s group called themselves Apfel, which is written as Apple. </p><br/><p>It is a name I have no recollections whatsoever.</p><br/><p>It seems like Lorel remembered them as Apple instead of Apfel, and called them Apple and people of Apple.</p><br/><p>\u201cEra\u2026sed?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>It sounded conspiracy-like. Ominous words.</p><br/><p>Moreover, Rokuya-san is one of the affected parties, and yet, he doesn\u2019t seem to be blaming anyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou see, Munemori revealed it to Root. About us\u2026more accurately speaking, about the power of our master.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201cYour master\u2019s\u2026\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>It seems like Rokuya-san\u2019s group, the Adventurers of Origin, have a leader they call master.</p><br/><p>But rather than a relationship of one being in higher standing than the other, it sounded more like another word denoting a friend.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s with this.</p><br/><p>I myself\u2026feel like I have a relationship like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot only Munemori, us as well, the heroes, and also you; when coming here, you received a power, right?\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes\u2026eh?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cFor example; Munemori received \u2018the Sword of Ambition, Desire\u2019 and \u2018the Sword of Oath, Damocles\u2019. A cheat sword that responds to his will and becomes stronger without the need of a blacksmith, and\u2026the sword of resolution that you make an oath and as long as you protect it, all of your abilities are raised. The second one, in the case that he broke the oath, he receives a big wound, so it wasn\u2019t all merits though.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201cEhm\u2026\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd in my case, it is a bit special, you see. I can\u2019t talk in detail about the second one, but the first one is a bit different from norm, an ability that links my comrades.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In other words, Rokuya-san is \u2013no, all the Adventurers of Origin are\u2026Wise?</p><br/><p>And as if natural, it seems he also sees through me as well.</p><br/><p>But what is this second one he is talking about?</p><br/><p>In my case, I was summoned by a God, and at that time, I received [Sakai] from Tsukuyomi-sama. That\u2019s the only one I got.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t tell me, is the language comprehension of the Goddess that she jammed inside of me also counted?</p><br/><p>Is that the second one?</p><br/><p>\u2026Seriously?</p><br/><p>\u201cUs six came here at the same time, and noticed that we had acquired an ability. And the one who was able to exercise that ability was master. That\u2019s why\u2026yeah, link would be the correct understanding of it.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201cLink ability.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Six.</p><br/><p>If that\u2019s the case, at least they wouldn\u2019t be lonely. Even if they had come to a terrible world.</p><br/><p>But this link ability, I don\u2019t really understand it well.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, that\u2019s the \u2018Blood Pledge, Guild Verse\u2019. Don\u2019t know what sort of fate this is, but we were companions in an MMO -or so to speak, an online game- we played in those days. And our abilities were connected with it. What a joke.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Ah, a net game.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>So that\u2019s what it is.</p><br/><p>Rokuya-san and his companions, and then there\u2019s the master .</p><br/><p>Guild comrades in an online game.</p><br/><p>I see.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe details of it are\u2026to put it in an easy to understand way for you, it would be the reproduction of the online game system. Well, strictly speaking, it is different though. In other words, from a novice, I can hunt mamonos and change my job to thief, and after that, assassin, and further after, I can decide on a specialized job\u2026it is that kind of setup. There\u2019s also a shared warehouse that other people can\u2019t see, side quests, and other fine details in the ability.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>It is truly a guild.</p><br/><p>And this entered the ears of Root, and that\u2019s how the current guild was established.</p><br/><p>They are truly the adventurers of origin.</p><br/><p>No lies in their name.</p><br/><p>But from what I have heard until now, I don\u2019t understand the meaning behind them being erased from history.</p><br/><p>It doesn\u2019t explain the point about the immortality either.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn other words, it is that right? Root took the idea of the Adventurer Guild from the ability of you guys? If the information of Root\u2019s husband was about that ability, that\u2019s plausible but\u2026\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>It seemed like Tomoe was putting it all together, but at the same time, her eyes were saying there\u2019s more to it.</p><br/><p>Rokuya-san silently nods.</p><br/><p>He continues.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Root took an interest in the structure called a guild, and tried to replicate it. It is certainly true that she heard about Guild Verse from Munemori and got the idea. But the part that would serve as the core, in the end, she was unable to create it.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s strange. In the end, he did create the guild and is the guild master.</p><br/><p>And in present, Root is still the guild master.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if she is the heavenly dragon Root that governs over a percent of the world, as expected, there\u2019s no way she would be able to grasp the essentials of the Earth\u2019s pc online games. She desperately gathered information from me, master, and the other members.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026must have been annoying.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>To the point you would want to call the police.</p><br/><p>\u201cNah. Even if she was a dragon on the inside, her appearance was that of a peerless beauty. The three men counting me actually enjoyed it, you know. Root was aggressive, she wasn\u2019t as stubborn towards one person like Munemori, she let us enjoy without any hesitation.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026I see.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Eh?</p><br/><p>Could it be, I\u2019m quite the herbivorous?</p><br/><p>Or is it that, Root had quite the appeal in the past?</p><br/><p>Judging from the atmosphere in the story, not only Rokuya-san, the other two members also enjoyed it.</p><br/><p>I am currently receiving a culture shock here.</p><br/><p>Rokuya-san is a Wise -though I don\u2019t know from what era he is- he must be a japanese person.</p><br/><p>If he is a person of the Showa era, were the men of that era this indiscriminate?</p><br/><p>In that era, did they dig in when a woman made advances on you?</p><br/><p>Seriously?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026By the way, I was born at the end of the Showa era. I don\u2019t think our perceptions are that different, Raidou-kun.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201cA\u2026Ahahaha\u2026\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Did he master mind reading?</p><br/><p>I am blocking the magic type, and there\u2019s no signs of him probing.</p><br/><p>My expression as well, I have lately been able to hide the things that show on my face.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like you are not self-aware of it, so this might be a good chance to tell you. You are a late bloomer. There\u2019s a limit to being herbivorous. It has been several years since you came to this world, right? In age\u2026you are already over twenty huh. \u2018Sleeping with somebody will only be with the person I have decided to marry for the rest of my life\u2019, that kind of ideal is so far from reality it is close to being a delusion, you know? If you are being desired, it is fine to desire as well. That\u2019s all there is to it, and there\u2019s no need to think too deeply about it.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>He looks at Tomoe, looks at Mio, and even looks at Shii, and then, sighs and points a finger straight at me as he said that to me.</p><br/><p>Shii is also okay with you, Rokuya-san?</p><br/><p>It is true that I am an adult, but that\u2019s clearly already crimina\u2014no, let\u2019s leave it at that.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo well, you see, it is been a while already, so there\u2019s things that are just hard to advance towards\u2026\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Are you seriously saying that? Going through the trouble of finding a partner for one night would be just\u2026 there\u2019s two women at both your sides that are practically shouting that they are ready anytime you want, right? If you are at a lost, if it\u2019s those two, even if it is the two at the same time, they would probably not complain, you know?\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201cRokuya-san! You are going too far.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What is this person saying.</p><br/><p>I hurriedly object as I look at the two.</p><br/><p>Tomoe and Mio are obviously angered\u2026or not?</p><br/><p>Oh.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>On the contrary, Mio was stealthily giving a thumbs up to Rokuya-san. Her face is slightly red.</p><br/><p>Tomoe didn\u2019t say anything, but she was nodding and going \u2018Umu Umu\u2019.</p><br/><p>No well, it isn\u2019t as if I didn\u2019t know, but\u2026in the past, the figures of Hasegawa and Higashi were definitely bigger than Tomoe and Mio.</p><br/><p>Then, if asked now, it would be about the same, or actually\u2026</p><br/><p>But if we were to cross the line, I feel like a variety of restrains will be broken.</p><br/><p>Thinking about my determination of returning to Japan wavering and disappearing\u2026honestly speaking, I am scared.</p><br/><p>And in reality, whether it is Rokuya-san, that Munemori person, and the Adventurers of Origin; they have all stayed in this world without returning.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Fuh\u2026 Sorry. It was probably not something for me to talk about. Let\u2019s return to the main topic.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Sorry.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is fine. And so, Root thoroughly researched about us and Guild Verse, but it didn\u2019t bear fruit. However, Root thought that an adventurer guild was a necessary existence in the future of the world. Just as her attitude showed, she wasn\u2019t the type who would obey the Goddess after all.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, Root is like that. I think his stance is different from that of the Goddess.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I can tell by the fact that he is thinking of things like thinning out the hyumans.</p><br/><p>So Root has been like that in the past too, and Rokuya-san had noticed that way of thinking Root had.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why\u2026\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Rokuya-san slightly narrows his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cRoot has already diverged from the Guild Verse system, and she is trying to make it a permanent existence in this world.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201cIn other words, it means that Root is trying to make it possible for the Adventurer Guild to have your ability as well?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. But for the sake of that, he needs the cooperation of the Goddess, and more than that, there\u2019s the need for our cooperation as well.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. Leaving aside the Goddess, the cooperation of you guys would definitely be a necessary.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, the price that was asked for was way too big. You probably already have an idea but\u2026for the sake of that, all the people related to the Guild Verse ability are required to live forever. If the Wise die, the ability goes with them after all.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201c?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why, a lot happened, Raidou-kun. By the Goddess, Guild Verse became the core of the Adventurer Guild, and we became immortal. But you see, a problem was born in this.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201cProblem?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u2018Yeah\u2019, Rokuya answers with a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt that rate, our achievements would be way too big. Moreover, the Adventurers of Origin are immortal. I was a charismatic person in those days, you see. If I wanted to, I would have been able to become the king of a major power.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201cObviously. Receiving immortality, bringing the Adventurer Guild to this world; those are achievements that would surpass a king of a major power.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why it was inconvenient for Root. Her unyielding wish was for Munemori to be the greatest brave of that time. Fufu, in the end, she beared the child of Munemori. Even if she was a Superior Dragon, it was her first time having a child. She went wild probably because of the maternal instincts that were suddenly born in her.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201cMaternal instincts have nothing to do with that. That\u2019s way too much of a selfish wish.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha, right. It is just as you say, Raidou. But this is not something that\u2019s happening now, it is all history that was settled thousands of years already. Also, it is not the history of winners, you know? It is the history of people that are fading away. It is not something for you to be so riled up about. In the first place, I who am one of the related parties don\u2019t feel anger towards Root.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?! If what you have done is true, then that bad treatment of Root would be similar to what the Goddess did to m\u2014!!\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter the sequence of events and the conclusion of it, the Adventurers of Origin became a minor fairy tale of Lorel, but Root has been able to properly maintain the Adventurer Guild in this thousands of years.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe hyumans growing haughty was in part the Goddess\u2019 fault, and even Root wouldn\u2019t be able to stop that, but a diverse amount of demi-humans and a narrow amount of demons have been able to survive until today. It is certain that she has been able to carry out her role in the Adventurer Guild which she fervently spoke of in the past.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Even so, there are things that can\u2019t be forgiven as well.</p><br/><p>Being forced immortality, and have your existence erased, that\u2019s just\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why, the Adventurers of Origin, as well as I, have accepted most of our circumstances already.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2018Most\u2019?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cAs troublesome as it is, the one man that has to accept it the most, is still fighting against it. And so, at that time in the past, there was one kind dragon that was enraged by this, just like how you are, Raidou-kun -no, that rage was even higher than yours.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>Dragon.</p><br/><p>Could that be\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cA dragon, you say? I don\u2019t think there was anyone who would be able to fight against Root in the past. At the very least, I don\u2019t know of one.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Tomoe tilts her head.</p><br/><p>I see.</p><br/><p>Leaving aside if both of them have met before, Tomoe was alive at that time as well.</p><br/><p>She learned about the Guild when she heard of it from Root, so she was probably asleep at that time anyways.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo surprise. In those days, the other Superior Dragons aside from Root and Futsu didn\u2019t boast much strength after all.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201cAs I have said, I don\u2019t know of a dragon named Futsu-ja. It seems like it is known widely in this country, but who in the world is that-ja?\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>After a brief silence, Tomoe seeks an answer from Rokuya-san.</p><br/><p>It is certainly true that the name Doma is spread in Lorel Union as well, but the name of Futsu surpassed that.</p><br/><p>And Doma is being seen as a dungeon\u2019s Superior Dragon, but it felt as if Futsu was being directed something like reverence.</p><br/><p>It felt like the kind of reverence they direct to Spirits and the Goddess.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Ancestral Dragon of Heavens, Heavenly Dragon Root; directly opposite, the Ancestral Dragon of the Land, Land Dragon Futsu. The matchless Superior Dragons that possess the highest of powers, however, Futsu was against the creation of the Adventurer Guild, and\u2026as a result, its power was snatched away by Root and was terminated.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201c?!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a matter of Superior Dragons. It is a top secret matter that would be bad if Root knew, so Raidou, please keep it a secret as well, okay? After that, its existence was thoroughly erased by the hands of Root, even more thoroughly than in our case. That was way too pitiful you see. We saved it.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201cAs I thought, I don\u2019t know of it. If we are talking about a land dragon, it would be Grount, right?\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cMore accurately speaking, that girl is a Sand Dragon. Can\u2019t be helped, we are talking about Root here. She probably persistently chipped off the memories of Futsu from the other Superior Dragons every time they were dormant or were reincarnating. It was probably easier than erasing the Adventurers of Origin from the history of people.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat damn Root\u2026\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Futsu had acted as how it normally acts, the situation wouldn\u2019t have gotten so screwed. In the end, whether it is people or dragons, what decides things is most likely emotions over logic. Fufu.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>Rokuya-san was probably reminiscing the events of one thousand years ago, he laughs.</p><br/><p>Even though this was their defeat.</p><br/><p>Receiving the curse of immortality and having their existence erased from history; that\u2019s right, it is supposed to be a defeat.</p><br/><p>And yet, is this really something that one can look back at it a thousand years after and laugh?</p><br/><p>I\u2026probably will end up fighting them at the floors below the tenth.</p><br/><p>Since they are immortal, there\u2019s only one way to beat Rokuya-san and the others, I have no choice but to break their will.</p><br/><p>No, Tomoe and Mio are probably already investigating this immortality of Rokuya-san.</p><br/><p>If possible, his memories of it as well.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s probably the reason why the two aren\u2019t speaking much and simply look like they are listening to the story.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s the possibility that there will be some sort of way to break through this situation from what they might figure out.</p><br/><p>But\u2026the will of people that are able to accept defeat in this manner, if I have no choice but to break it, just how am I going to?</p><br/><p>Is it breakable?</p><br/><p>I currently\u2026don\u2019t know.</p><br/><p>I felt something heavy slowly accumulating in my stomach.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

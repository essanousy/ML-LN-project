As the Head of the Adventurer Guild, I am sorry for showing you this pathetic shape of mine.\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>What kind of laudable things are you saying this late in the game?</p><br/><p>In the first place, what\u2019s this about being wounded?</p><br/><p>Root\u2019s whole body is covered in bandages. And his left foot is plastered like how they classically do when one has a bone fracture; lifted up and hanged.</p><br/><p>It is true that he looks like a picturesque wounded person.</p><br/><p>It even looks grave.</p><br/><p>But from what I have heard, the reason why he is down is because of the after-effects of using blaze, in other words, exhaustion.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoing something stupid in a divine form, and when you return, you do a cosplay of an injured person? You must be betting your life in this joke.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cHow rude to call it cosplay. These are all real wounds, Raidou-dono.\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that it was exhaustion and that it will take one week for full recovery though.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Raidou-dono, that information is old. A while ago it would have been true though. From what I see now, it will take around 1 month to recover.\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u2026What\u2019s that about \u2018from what I see\u2019?</p><br/><p>Have a doctor look at it.</p><br/><p>Now that I think about it, in this world, there\u2019s no big hospital.</p><br/><p>There are small places for medical examination, but I don\u2019t see a place that has a good amount of beds and medical staff.</p><br/><p>It will mostly be done with magic, and it is true that there are many medicines that show their effects in a really fast manner, but\u2026a doctor huh.</p><br/><p>Treating dragons would be a special case, so excluding that point, yeah\u2026a veterinarian, or a demi-human doctor, it might be good to try raising one.</p><br/><p>Well, even if I say that, the one who will do the actual raising will not be me, and the one who will be thinking about the curriculum and producing it will not be me either.</p><br/><p>I will just be telling and leaving everything to others, so I can\u2019t just carefreely tell them to try it and it is also unknown if it will actually give form.</p><br/><p>Well, it would be good if it serves as some sort of impetus.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you make a diagnosis by yourself?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, Raidou-dono. Even if I look like this, I am confident that my medical skills are better than those of the doctors and priests around.\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>For a while now he has been going \u2018Raidou-dono, Raidou-dono\u2019.</p><br/><p>What he is saying is also normal, so maybe today he is scheming something.</p><br/><p>It is a saving grace that I don\u2019t have to hear the thoughts of a pervert, but this is eerie.</p><br/><p>He always calls me Makoto-kun.</p><br/><p>He calls me Raidou-dono only when he is acting as the Guild Master.</p><br/><p>But right now we are inside the office, so there\u2019s no need to do that.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd? You are quite distant here. What are you scheming today, Ro\u2013?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cRaidou-dono!\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>?</p><br/><p>How unusual for him to cut off my words.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like you get along pretty well. There\u2019s a lot of mysteries regarding him, but it seems like it has increased by one more. Well then Falz-dono, please rest properly and have your body recover. About the matter of the representative, I have understood the situation, so it is fine now.\u201d</p><br/><p>!!</p><br/><p>\u201cI am sorry for not being able to give you much hospitality and has ended up all being talk about work, representative Zara. In the meantime, I will be counting on you.\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cBetween us, visits are a pretext. Don\u2019t mind it. I see, Falz-dono and him, both have a lot of secrets. Maybe that was the motive to how you get along? Then, maybe I should have secrets myself and see how it goes, hahaha.\u201d (Zara)</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t joke.\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe cooperation of you two was a big help in the recovery of Rotsgard. Being in good terms with each other is something to be happy about. I might have been a bit jealous. Now then, see you later.\u201d (Zara)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, you as well, take care of yourself.\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>W-Why is Zara-san here?</p><br/><p>I should have activated Sakai.</p><br/><p>In the first place, Root should tell me with thought transmission.</p><br/><p>Ah, in this room you can\u2019t use thought transmission.</p><br/><p>It seems to be the prided technology(self-proclaimed) of Root.</p><br/><p>(Raidou, when you finish the visit, lend me your time. I will be waiting, not at the merchant guild, but at my store.) (Zara)</p><br/><p>As he passes beside me, he whispers.</p><br/><p>Without hearing the answer, Zara-san leaves.</p><br/><p>Ah, my next plan has been decided.</p><br/><p>My plans were to eat, check my store, and then go to the Academy though.</p><br/><p>It is bitter that all of those plans are postponable.</p><br/><p>It is hard to refuse a person that has been taking care of me in this town.</p><br/><p>\u201cRoot, aren\u2019t you cruel?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought I was doing a good enough follow-up for you to notice though.\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>After Zara-san left, I immediately voice out my complains.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the first place, if you have a visitor already, it is alright to just have me wait. From what I see, the conversation was over already after all.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cMakoto-kun too; I thought that since you are standing in this stage, you maybe would be able to manage, and wanted to try it out.\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cDo tests in tests. Don\u2019t suddenly go for it in crucial moments.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I remember correctly, in the olden days, Zara got very good at erasing his presence. But it isn\u2019t something that can\u2019t be sounded out. Wouldn\u2019t it be good for Makoto-kun to be able to do something a high ranked adventurer can? It seems like you have magic that specializes in searching, but do that without relying on it.\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cGuh.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, just like what I said before, I am currently gravely wounded.\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cI did hear. It will take 1 month to recover, right? Weren\u2019t you only tired because of using blaze?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026While I was down on bed, I had visitors you see. Two women with fiendish smiles.\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cWomen huh.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>There\u2019s still brave people out there that can do this much to Root huh.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose women entered this room I was resting in, and in an instant, they flipped me out of bed, and while laughing malevolently, they assaulted me with punches and kicks.\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>Malevolently\u2026scary.</p><br/><p>We are talking about this pervert, so there\u2019s no doubt he has bought the grudge of many.</p><br/><p>But to invade when he is weakened and assault him while laughing\u2026</p><br/><p>Your daily actions are important.</p><br/><p>Lately I haven\u2019t taken care of my students, so maybe there\u2019s a need to be slightly gentler with them.</p><br/><p>Yeah.</p><br/><p>\u201cKarma, what a deep word, isn\u2019t it?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Words that have no trace of sympathy towards me. Even though one of them was the samurai otaku of your place though.\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>Hah?</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though I was so exhausted that I couldn\u2019t make a single move, that samurai otaku and that middle-aged desert lizard woman brought blunt weapons and came to beat me up!\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>Tomoe, just when I was wondering that she was strangely kind when speaking of Root, it wasn\u2019t because she was bribed, but because she had already been refreshed.</p><br/><p>I remember the words of Tomoe a few days ago: \u2018Even if he is like that, it is true that he has been taking care of us, so how about going to visit him at least once, Waka?\u2019 </p><br/><p>When I look at this terrible spectacle and look back at what she said, the meaning changes into having a loyal dog showing its hunting results to its master.</p><br/><p>Leaving aside if she is actually a loyal dog type.</p><br/><p>In that case, the other one is Sand Wave, Grount-san?</p><br/><p>Regarding her, I was told that she doesn\u2019t leave the White Desert so I had to bring the egg to her.</p><br/><p>If she can come to Rotsgard to beat up Root, shouldn\u2019t she be able to come get the egg?</p><br/><p>\u2026Or could it be that this pervert is that much troublesome even within the superior dragons?</p><br/><p>\u201cI see.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the first place, isn\u2019t the original reason for it because you brought out that possibility from the sacred treasure? Just what kind of luck you have, Makoto-kun?! And yet, that Tomoe said: \u2018You went all the way to a demon race city to stalk Waka? It seems like Waka has collapsed, what will you do about it?\u2019! And Grount was Grount, the only thing she said was: \u2018Hohohoho!\u2019! That\u2019s scary!\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201c?!! That\u2019s wrong isn\u2019t it?! You are the main culprit for setting up a stupid attack that would make you drop for 1 week! In the first place, I wasn\u2019t the one who activated it, it was the demon race people! Do you know how much trouble I had to go through to stop that genocidal weapon by the name of blaze?!\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cFor some reason, I am absolutely sure that it wouldn\u2019t have happened if you weren\u2019t there! It troubled me as well you know?! I was in the middle of seducing my new secretary in a restaurant with good atmosphere, when I was forcefully summoned! Thanks to that, she thought I suddenly ran away from her, and because I have been bedridden, it is incredibly difficult to do a follow-up!!\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cLike hell I care! Here I nullified all of those buckshots and the thick one that came after, and collapsed from that! Even so, one of the attacks fell to the far mountains, and things turned hectic. I later received a report that there were no casualties, so I was a bit relieved though! There were several tens of deaths at the city, so don\u2019t turn defiant!\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cI set it up with power enough to cause a hole on the level of a country after a\u2014,wait, several tens?\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>There were probably more, but as far as I know!</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! Because of the roar that came before the blaze, severals tens of deaths appeared, mainly within the children and old ones of the demon race! If we were to count the other injured ones, the digits would increase by two you know?! Reflect on what you have done, reflect on it!\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, isn\u2019t that place in cinders, or more like, didn\u2019t it end up with a deep hole? I heard the place of Crimson Red was safe, but the demon race settlements that were around the area were wiped out, right?\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way. I received it all and nullified it. The price was that I collapsed though. You made me feel the stifling sensation of having my magic power deplete, something that I would have prefered not tasting it ever. Why did I have to collapse from taking care of your own blunders? Remembering it, even now I\u2026yeah, Tomoe did good! That\u2019s how I feel!\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Makoto-kun.\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, suddenly going quiet.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you make it disappear?\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cI had Mio gather it, and then, I received it and extinguished it.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cWith magic?\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>The atmosphere of Root changed.</p><br/><p>How to say it, it was as if a mass of curiosity was reflected in those eyes.</p><br/><p>His eyes being blank was also kinda scary.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy changing my Magic Armor, or something like that. I had Shiki provide support, so I actually don\u2019t know the details well.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I felt like it would be better to not mention Creation, so I decide to play the fool.</p><br/><p>I explain by mixing in some truth and make it hard to discover.</p><br/><p>\u201cA change to Materia Prima\u2026That\u2026can you do it now?\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really don\u2019t listen to what others say. Didn\u2019t I tell you that I had Shiki provide support? I can\u2019t.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I see. You were able to, in essence, stop it by yourself without having casualties in the surroundings\u2026I see\u2026\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>It seems like he has begun muttering by himself.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s new.</p><br/><p>Just that, in Root\u2019s case, the new facets I see of him are all disappointing.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeey, are you alive? While I was in this visit, I was thinking about receiving the candidates list of the adventurers that can go to Kaleneon; you can do it, right? Hellooo~\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Makoto-kun, I am hurt.\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you are saying that, use the word wounded, or maybe, \u2018I have been wounded\u2019, would be more accurate? No wait, listen to what I am saying.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it. Those two wounded my body, but Makoto-kun has left my heart in shambles. That\u2019s why saying: \u2018I am hurt\u2019, is correct.\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026You know, I am sorry to say this but, that goes for both of us.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why, please leave for today. If it\u2019s about the list, I have left it with the girl that guided you here, so you can just take it. I may be in this state, but I haven\u2019t cut corners, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I see.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. A few moments ago, Zara called for you, right? Go there already.\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>How cold.</p><br/><p>That helps me a lot.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood. Take care of yourself.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cI am waiting for you to creep in my bed at night.\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I will tell Tomoe and Grount-san that message.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I have already gotten used to his sexual harassment.</p><br/><p>Now then, let\u2019s go to Zara-san\u2019s store.</p><br/><p>If I remember correctly, the brothel\u2026I mean, the real estate store.</p><br/><p>When he is speaking about \u2018my store\u2019, he means that place.</p><br/><p>Publicly, Zara-san doesn\u2019t touch brothels.</p><br/><p>I give a backward glance at Root, and head outside to receive the tube that has the list inside from the reception lady.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you been doing outside work lately? Since that incident, your popularity has increased, and beginning with the major powers, the other countries are also calling for you, is how things are going?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Just as you have surmised.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Arriving at the store of Zara-san, I was acquainted enough with the reception and the employees to exchange greetings and be welcomed, and was allowed inside the room of the representative.</p><br/><p>It seems like there\u2019s pretty few merchants brought into the room of Zara-san instead of his office, and the first time I was allowed to the room, there were eyes of surprise and doubt directed at me.</p><br/><p>And so, Zara-san is in the middle of seeing through the outside work I have been doing recently.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like you have done a bad management in your visits to the places\u2026is what I want to say, but there\u2019s no way you would be able to refuse Gritonia and Limia, so well, there are times when people have to taste busier times than others. This can\u2019t be helped.\u201d (Zara)</p><br/><p>Oh?</p><br/><p>I thought he would get angry at me, but he is being kind of nice.</p><br/><p>Because of his looks, I feel around 50% more kindness.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are always absent in the Guild meetings, but the representative is properly coming out, so there should be no problem. I was surprised that the representative was not Shiki-san but a demi-human. After the incident, this town has lessened its discrimination towards demi-humans. There have been many survivors that were saved by demi-humans after all. I don\u2019t know how long this will last, but it seems like it still isn\u2019t that time.\u201d (Zara)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good inclination.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Church doesn\u2019t seem to like this much, but the tops of this town\u2019s church are good willed. The current head at that place may not look like it, but she is a good listener.\u201d (Zara)</p><br/><p>The only thing I remember about her is that she has a nice voice, but it seems she is somewhat exemplar.</p><br/><p>For people that are dispatched to other towns, it is a necessary ability.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour representatives are also doing their part, you know? Those girls\u2026Akua and Eris, was it? Those girls have given a number of sharp opinions and interesting proposals. There are people that say it with a joking tone but with serious eyes that they would prefer to have them attend more instead of you.\u201d (Zara)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I would prefer if you were to just mention the joking part.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cIdiot, learn of the atmosphere. Every time, there\u2019s someone that proposes those two to start a business, but they always immediately reject it. I don\u2019t know why, but you were blessed with good subordinates. Treasure them, and make them useful for your own growth.\u201d (Zara)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I will do my best.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cSince the time Rembrandt told me of you, I have been watching you, but it seems like it is not that you are messing around, just that you haven\u2019t caught up, that\u2019s all. Despite this, your surrounding environment and the goods you have are so extraordinary, that you are steadily increasing your position. That\u2019s close to terrifying.\u201d (Zara)</p><br/><p>Totally true.</p><br/><p>\u2026Like seriously true.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t expect that Zara-san would be the one telling me this though.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am still inexperienced, and I\u2019m lacking a lot.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, really. If we are to seriously raise you as a merchant, I think it would be best to cut you off your surroundings and have you work at a branch store of some random town. If it were me, I would do that. But in your case, you are a \u2018fighting merchant\u2019 after all, no, an \u2018army merchant\u2019 would be more fitting, maybe? It kinda feels lukewarm. \u2018Annihilation Merchant\u2019, \u2018Landmine Merchant\u2019\u2026it somehow isn\u2019t coming out well, but it is around those types. There\u2019s no precedents.\u201d (Zara)</p><br/><p>W-What cruel comparisons.</p><br/><p>Moreover, the word merchant totally feels like an extra.</p><br/><p>\u201cUhm, and so, what business did you have?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Being teased more than this will make me sad, so I decide to hear what he has to say.</p><br/><p>My stomach doesn\u2019t hurt from just meeting him anymore, but after this, I want to go to the Academy.</p><br/><p>I want to finish the irregular business as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, yeah, I have two. The first one is regarding the cooperation for the future reconstruction. The other is about Ester.\u201d (Zara)</p><br/><p>Leaving aside the reconstruction, the place of Ester-san?</p><br/><p>Something to do with the brothel?</p><br/><p>In that case, it must be about \u2018those girls\u2019.</p><br/><p>I haven\u2019t been told about any problems.</p><br/><p>I would be able to understand if Ester-san has opinions she would want to tell Zara-san but, I wonder what it is about?</p><br/><p>\u201cCooperation for the reconstruction, is it.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, currently, you are leaving the reconstruction to your employees and your students. It has been quite helpful. And about that, there\u2019s something I want to confirm but, can we continue the cooperation in this pace?\u201d (Zara)</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. There\u2019s still areas that haven\u2019t been reconstructed, and the places where the last variants rampaged, are still in shambles. I heard that that place will be serviced as a park, so it should be the first to be constructed, right?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a great help. Honestly, the cooperation of Kuzunoha Company is so crucial that it is influencing the pace of it. The two big trees that suddenly appeared have enough presence to become the symbol of Academy Town in the future. I can\u2019t increase the priority in construction, but I would want to work in that area.\u201d (Zara)</p><br/><p>If the variants are able to provide a restful place for the people of this town in the future, it isn\u2019t a bad place to die.</p><br/><p>The park may not be high priority, but if we are able to maintain the speed of reconstruction, it is not a far off future.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so, was there some sort of problem in Ester-san\u2019s place? They are girls that are inexperienced with the outside world, but I thought that they didn\u2019t cause any problems though.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026No problem has been caused. Raidou, you, where did you kidnap those girls from?\u201d (Zara)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Zara-san, that\u2019s not a funny joke. I just purely worked as an intermediary. I just tied the girls with a place to work in.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no way I would be trafficking hyumans.</p><br/><p>Kuzunoha Company won\u2019t do business that I don\u2019t want to do.</p><br/><p>I am already in depression because of the matter of that demon, Sari.</p><br/><p>It seems like no matter what, trafficking slaves is not fit for me.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuh, it is a joke. But I didn\u2019t think that you would bring women when I gave you that free pass to the brothels. And it seems you haven\u2019t \u2018used\u2019 it, not even once, Raidou. Ester was sad that you didn\u2019t come.\u201d (Zara)</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease spare me from that. I don\u2019t have the time to\u2014\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cTime to embrace a woman is something that can be created even if busy. If you really wanted to embrace one, that is.\u201d (Zara)</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the first place, Ester-san is not a prostitute but the store manager, isn\u2019t she?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cManager and prostitute. If she likes the customer, she will accompany them. She must have proclaimed herself as a prostitute when she spoke with you, right? Well, in truth, the amount of people that she likes can be counted with the fingers of a hand, so you can brag about it, you know.\u201d (Zara)</p><br/><p>\u201cBrag about what. Then there\u2019s no real problem with those girls, right?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cIn general, no. If I had to say one, it is that I was asked if I can increase the numbers more.\u201d (Zara)</p><br/><p>\u201cNumbers?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou presented them as demi-humans, but in reality, we are able to put them out in the store as hyumans to the customers. It is quite popular. There are customers that have become addicted already.\u201d (Zara)</p><br/><p>If I called them mamonos, they wouldn\u2019t accept them, so I told them they were demi-humans. And yet, at some point in time, they were beginning to treat them as hyumans huh.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not turning into a problem, so oh well.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs a hyuman? Well, there are no special traits that can be seen in their outward appearance after all.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. There are no few amount of idiots that only take hyumans within the customers, but if they don\u2019t notice it, it doesn\u2019t matter to us. If they don\u2019t like it, they should notice it. In that case, we show them as hyumans in good faith.\u201d (Zara)</p><br/><p>In those parts, I don\u2019t have that way of thinking.</p><br/><p>The kind of thinking that it is the customers\u2019 fault for not noticing what the goods taken from the store are and fool them.</p><br/><p>By the way, in this world, it is quite normal for customers to request connoisseurs, so people that have a standard of only using genuine articles like me, are in the minority.</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout the popularity, is there no envy from the other girls?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that aspect, Ester is properly holding the reins. And so, the reconstruction is going well, and the customers, the men from town, workers from outside, guardians of the students, and a variety of other people have been increasing. There\u2019s been talk about creating a new community building. And, I was asked if there were other girls from their village that can come here. Ester-san has been pestering me about it.\u201d (Zara)</p><br/><p>\u201cI see.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I think I heard something about the guardians of the students, but I ignore it.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust like you told me, I have not investigated the backgrounds of those girls. That\u2019s why I am asking you in this way. How about it?\u201d (Zara)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026If it\u2019s a few, I think there will be some that will want to. In a near future, I will have someone from my company give you the details of my answer.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Actually, it is limited to the Gorgons that have been able to somewhat control their petrification ability though. I have been sending a few of them to the brothel of Rotsgard.</p><br/><p>Regarding this matter, Zara-san is also referring to those girls.</p><br/><p>It doesn\u2019t seem like they have been causing any real problems, so it looks like it is going really well.</p><br/><p>When I got the free pass, I thought it was a waste of a treasure, but I am happy that it was able to work as a plus for the Gorgons, Zara-san, and me.</p><br/><p>But the petrification control is a bottleneck, and it isn\u2019t something that all of them are able to do.</p><br/><p>Right now, unless they are quite the strong Gorgons, they are unable to leave Asora.</p><br/><p>From within them, half of them have been sent to the brothel, and half have been placed around the company and as clerks.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am counting on you.\u201d (Zara)</p><br/><p>\u201cHere as well, I am grateful to have them working.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I am truly relieved that it didn\u2019t come to having them die without me noticing and ending up in a dispute with you. They are able to suppress the violent customers as well after all. They are truly priceless treasures. Please tell them from my part that they can come work at my place anytime they want.\u201d (Zara)</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, it seems like those girls are sleeping at your Kuzunoha Company but, are you okay with the rumors? If you want to, I can prepare a place for them to live in. If they have some sort of custom that makes it hard to live together, it doesn\u2019t have to be in the brothel, I can prepare a house for them if necessary.\u201d (Zara)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are really rating them highly.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cI like people that are positive and talented at their own job after all.\u201d (Zara)</p><br/><p>\u2026I am positive, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m talented, so\u2026</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s just honestly accept the acknowledgement he has given to the Gorgons.</p><br/><p>They are also working diligently in the company as well, so I am grateful.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will tell them. If business here is done, I will be taking my leave now.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I had to say. Just, this is something I am curious about, so I will ask. Raidou, do you intend to do something at the sea this time? From here to the sea, it is quite far, but you smell like salt, you know? Even if you are working outside, the sea was unexpected. In winter, the sea gets rough, so it doesn\u2019t serve as good business.\u201d (Zara)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, this is\u2026\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it is related to your business, there\u2019s no need to force yourself to tell me. I don\u2019t think I will hear it. Actually, I want to scold you to keep it to yourself.\u201d (Zara)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Thanks for the lecture. It is related to a business that I might have in the future, so I will be keeping it to myself.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. That sincerity of yours, hide it when doing business here. It is ideal, but the places where that can be used are few.\u201d (Zara)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, well then, I will be taking my leave.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry for having you come all the way here. Be careful\u2026well, it might not be necessary for you, but there\u2019s unnecessary trouble littered anywhere. Tread smartly.\u201d (Zara)</p><br/><p>How to say it, every time I meet with him, it always ends with a lecture.</p><br/><p>As I thought, I am no good with him.</p><br/><p>Ehm, add in my schedule: \u2018how many of the Gorgons can currently go outside\u2019.</p><br/><p>When I return to Asora, I was planning on having the Winged-kin bring a few people related to the sea.</p><br/><p>I was thinking of having the Gorgons tag along with that, but it seems like that won\u2019t do now.</p><br/><p>In the first place, I am having those girls do something close to stock-farming in Asora, so it is fine to leave it like that.</p><br/><p>It is going well after all.</p><br/><p>Now then, there will soon be new residents, so it is not a pressing matter.</p><br/><p>It is close to noon, and in this time, the store gets quite busy, so it will be better if I don\u2019t go.</p><br/><p>The business I have left now would be, contacting Limia, and the Academy.</p><br/><p>The contact from Limia will be sent to the store, so first is the Academy huh.</p><br/><p>Right now it is lunch time, so it will be easy to find Jin and the others.</p><br/><p>When they are in the middle of classes, I would have to leave messages, and it will increase the trouble.</p><br/><p>I will have to do a follow-up since they have been working hard in the reconstruction.</p><br/><p>It is proper to tell them that classes will be beginning for real.</p><br/><p>About the applications for new students, it will probably go smoother if I first head to the office department.</p><br/><p>Just that, it will be troublesome with the Academy Principal and the teacher faction.</p><br/><p>While feeling my feet slightly heavy, I head out to the main street that has completely returned to its original state.</p><br/><p>Now then, next will be the Academy.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

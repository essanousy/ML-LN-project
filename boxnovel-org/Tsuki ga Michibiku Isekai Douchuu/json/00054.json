For them to still want to bring down their opponent even after he had defeated them once, how scary.</p><br/><p>\u2026 That\u2019s bad, I didn\u2019t notice it at all.</p><br/><p>When we talk about capital punishment, it reminds me of the death penalty, the one where you are incarcerated for an indefinite amount of time until you\u2019re dead. However, it seems that\u2019s not how their capital punishment works.</p><br/><p>\u201cHoh~! For that punishment to have been revived. I wonder why they still do it\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Tomoe seems to have already known about it, but it looks like she didn\u2019t expect it and was surprised by the mention of that weird thing called Tree Punishment. She later told me that it\u2019s a long lost punishment.</p><br/><p>I had already given up completely on it, but it seems that they didn\u2019t kill all the hyumans and there were even some strong ones that survived (narrowly) and have arrived to this village.</p><br/><p>Ah~, it\u2019s already no good. I drew my own conclusions and didn\u2019t try to investigate myself about it, leaving everything to Mio. How pathetic of me.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s take this as an example. When you get an SLG or RPG for the first time and don\u2019t know left from right but you still go Leroy Jenkins and get killed. In games you can reset, so you can just say \u201cDAMN IT!\u201d and that\u2019s it, but\u2026</p><br/><p>That there were a number of hyumans incarcerated.</p><br/><p>It was truly a blunder.</p><br/><p>The next morning, I was guided to the place of execution and discovered how heartless and scary this forest ogre\u2019s punishment was.</p><br/><p>Those guys, how dare they say the dark magic I used to scatter magic power was disgusting when they do these kind of thing.</p><br/><p>By the way, I don\u2019t think the hyumans were the ones who gave them that name, but I think I strangely understand why they were named \u2018forest ogres\u2019.</p><br/><p>This is what I thought of them before I came here.</p><br/><p>That their way of living was protecting the surroundings of the forest, or at least that was my impression. Being lumberjacks and hunters, maybe even carpenters. Honestly, it was to the point that I didn\u2019t understand why they abandoned the ability to talk with spirits and plants.</p><br/><p>Because I pictured them the exact same as elf that live in the forest after all.</p><br/><p>That was too sweet.</p><br/><p>The word forestry was truly a word that described them. Because they think of the plants and shrubs that grow and everything around that can be called forest as \u201ctargets to manage\u201d. They weren\u2019t targets for religious belief or targets for a friendly relationship.</p><br/><p>Hearing their voice, understanding their wills, talking with them.</p><br/><p>Any of those would have been bad influence for them.</p><br/><p>The ability to talk with animals aimed for consumption, being able to trade your thoughts with the vegetables you farm and cultivate. If you ask me if it would be beneficial for the people\u2026</p><br/><p>At least for me, it would be impossible. I wouldn\u2019t stand it.</p><br/><p>Moreover, this Tree Punishment. It\u2019s not completely, but it doesn\u2019t give me the image of an elf that protects the forest.</p><br/><p>The thicket of trees and shrubs that spread out before my eyes.</p><br/><p>There is a reason I don\u2019t call it a forest. It\u2019s because the things that were growing there had a fixed interval and it reminded me of the afforested forests that were artificially made.</p><br/><p>Moreover, all of them were developed to a certain extent. There were no signs of them slimming in between or breaking.</p><br/><p>And below every tree. The planted area was strange.</p><br/><p>Normally, there should be grass and dried leaves. The various evidences of it growing up and all of its circumstances were not there.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s the same earth as the wasteland I have been walking before.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this the Tree Punishment?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>My words became polite unintentionally.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 everything?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I was shocked, but it seems that Tomoe and Mio weren\u2019t at all. Tomoe already knew about it so it\u2019s okay, but for Mio to be like that as well. The standards of an otherworldler are, as expected, different from those in this world huh. Of course that\u2019s the case.</p><br/><p>Tree Punishment.</p><br/><p>A capital punishment that actually benefits the forest ogres.</p><br/><p>A unique skill that they can use on races that have a certain amount of magic power.</p><br/><p>It was the punishment \u2018to change your existence to that of trees\u2019.</p><br/><p>The beings that are changed will lose their consciousness with time and, in the end, they will lose their own memories. After a while of being transformed (several years to several decades), since your sensations still remain because of your soul, when branches are broken or your skin and interior are damaged, you will still feel pain. What a nightmare.</p><br/><p>The skill will be activated practically in an instant, and if the abnormal effect takes place, seconds later you will turn into a tree. What\u2019s up with these guys?</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, these are the people that have done outrageous things to the forest and the ones who invaded unreasonably\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the elders tells me as if it were nothing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis was a long lost ability of ours, but the person over there\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At the place where he points out, there was the muscle brain who was staggering while being carried by AB\u2019s shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt may be because of an ancestor. He awakened this power, so the Tree Punishment revived\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see, his blood must have been thicker or his element attainment was uncommon. To think that there was an individual that could reach such a level. What a surprise-ja na\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Tomoe seems to be convinced by something and nods repeatedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlong with the barrier\u2019s weakening, invaders have begun appearing in the area that we supervise and in our village. We left the combat matters for those fellows to deal with\u201d</p><br/><p>The combat leaders huh.</p><br/><p>Certainly, those type of people are\u2026 how to say it\u2026</p><br/><p>They have that kind of unreasonable strength and reliance. If one of them takes a flag, it would make you think that person is the bodyguard of a king. It\u2019s the type of muscle brain that is sweltering and has an excelling amount of instinct. Moreover, there are some that may actually think things thoroughly and have multiple types of brain tissues, the cheat type. I hope they are not that kind of type.</p><br/><p>This time, the situation was clearly hopeless. Those two that were supposed to be goners, were perfectly saved.</p><br/><p>Those AB that would soon wear me out if I try to keep them company, may be in an aide-like position with that man. They are lending him their shoulders and having a face that clearly tells the people in the vicinity of their worry.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have a plan regarding the barrier. Don\u2019t worry\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cLord Shen, I truly thank you very much. With this, there is no need to fear foreign enemies and we will be able to live in peace once again\u201d</p><br/><p>This is not a place I want to stay for long. I have finished most of what I came to do in their village.</p><br/><p>I signal Tomoe with my eyes and it seems that she understood what I was trying to say. I can\u2019t help but feel gloomy here.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, let\u2019s return. And also, forest ogres. I am Tomoe-ja. Don\u2019t make me repeat myself so much\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cWa, yes, Tomoe-sama\u201d</p><br/><p>The words of Tomoe were filled with anger.</p><br/><p>I have to shake off these chills running down my spine one way or another. Maybe it\u2019s because this is the first time in my life I have come to an execution place. It\u2019s extremely unpleasant.</p><br/><p>At the end, once more.</p><br/><p>I look at each and every one of the trees which I don\u2019t know what their past was about. Maybe they are hyumans, maybe demi-humans, or they could even be demonic beasts.</p><br/><p>Even when I use [Sakai] or Mio uses cure and curse release, they didn\u2019t return to their previous form. The moment it\u2019s activated, even I am unable to do anything. In my heart I carved the fact that this people have existed in this world.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t plan on leaving it like this.</p><br/><p>They committed a crime, so they received their punishment. It is one thing if they only use this power for these situations, but there is also the chance that they go rampant and use this power in battle as well.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know if I can do it, but I will try to look for a cure to it. Luckily, I have a skilled spider and her brethren as well.</p><br/><p>~ Muscle Brain ~</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t notice at all that a gross guy like Lich was using my body as a nest.</p><br/><p>The fatigues I have had lately and the strange sensation of getting steadily stronger doesn\u2019t seem to be because of awakening the power of the Tree Punishment.</p><br/><p>No, he may have been there before my ability awakened. This is something that no one will know though.</p><br/><p>The dragon that had created a barrier for us called Shen dealt with Lich. The deep mist that resembled haze, enveloped that fellows\u2019 body and erased it without leaving any trace behind.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t even a fragment of miasma left, it was a high-ranking usage of power. I see, I have clearly understood what kind of existences are those so called superior dragons.</p><br/><p>My body was not properly listening to me, but I was somehow able to attend the trip to the execution place.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s shameful to have Akua and Eris lend me their shoulders, but they told me that my vitality was drying up or something like that, a pretty dangerous state, so I couldn\u2019t say complain about it. I should be grateful that I am still alive.</p><br/><p>While I was doing small talk, I observed the black woman and the masked man, and also the dragon woman.</p><br/><p>No, to be honest, I was looking at the masked man.</p><br/><p>That guy seems to have used an unknown skill to defeat Lich. The dragon woman seems to be of the superior dragon race which Nirgi old man has been telling me stories of endlessly since I was small. The black woman as well, I don\u2019t feel like she is a hyuman.</p><br/><p>But that guy, that kid is a hyuman. And despite this, those two hold the same appearance as him. Could they be obeying him?</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t understand.</p><br/><p>Lately, since the time I returned from outside, I have been cautious of one unrestful guy.</p><br/><p>The elder\u2019s son who has been moving strangely.</p><br/><p>Because I was in bad condition, the management of the area and protection of the forest has been entrusted to other people. The times I stayed in the village grew longer.</p><br/><p>The movements of that guy, who seemed as if he were searching the village, convinced me that my worries were not needless.</p><br/><p>There were times when he seemed to be keeping in contact with someone, but I couldn\u2019t get a hold of that person.</p><br/><p>\u2014 It was at that day \u2014</p><br/><p>Akua and Eris returned safely without any injuries along with the invaders.</p><br/><p>In short, the intruders held back and they still managed to lose. Lately, the pattern of them losing and baiting the hyumans to the village has been more frequent. This is the first time for Akua and Eris, but with this I will have to make everyone go through the super training course.</p><br/><p>That means, later the intruders will be crushed in the banquet and throw into jail, is how it should go but\u2026 Adonou moved.</p><br/><p>Maybe they are the ones he has been keeping in contact with?</p><br/><p>I thought about that, but it seems that wasn\u2019t the case. He made a number of questions and went somewhere else. I was wrong huh.</p><br/><p>In the room there was only them and my disciples.</p><br/><p>It seems that my disciples wanted to bring them to my place.</p><br/><p>Even though I am so close to them, they still don\u2019t notice my presence. I will have to scold them severely later.</p><br/><p>I see.</p><br/><p>That means they are that much of a danger huh.</p><br/><p>To the point that they want to skip all that banquet business and bring them straight to my place.</p><br/><p>Then there\u2019s a change of plans.</p><br/><p>I will defeat these guys first. The result will be the same after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cYo! Are you guys the guests?!\u201d</p><br/><p>I quickly break down the walls and greet them. </p><br/><p>The black woman was vigilant of my disciples while taking me in mind. She is good, this one is strong.</p><br/><p>The masked one also grew vigilant the moment the sound rang out. Fumu.</p><br/><p>However, it is futile. Against me.</p><br/><p>It seems that they bullied my disciples, so I will be finishing this promptly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that you treated Akua and Eris as kids? That\u2019s quite impressive, hey, the Nii-chan over there, handshake! Let\u2019s do a handshake!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShishou!\u201d</p><br/><p>I do a big smile and stretch my hand to the masked one. My disciples seem to have noticed what I intended to do, I could feel their slight tension.</p><br/><p>And then, I certainly forced the masked man to do a handshake with me.</p><br/><p>This is it.</p><br/><p>Tree Punishment activated.</p><br/><p>In a few seconds, this guy will be turned into a tree and\u2026</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t turn.</p><br/><p>I try to grip him a number of times. I could feel the sensation transmitting, but the reaction is weak.</p><br/><p>\u201cC-Can you release me already?\u201d</p><br/><p>I could tell the strength in his hand was leaving. Just a bit longer huh. But this is the first time this has happened. What is going on?</p><br/><p>It\u2019s somehow\u2026 interesting. Nice. These kind of situations also happen huh.</p><br/><p>A moment later.</p><br/><p>A shock ran through my wrist.</p><br/><p>By the time I noticed it was pain, in front of me something appeared!</p><br/><p>I felt an overwhelming impact in all of my face, and while I was forcefully getting a hold of my face, what I saw was the posture of the black woman holding a folding fan.</p><br/><p>I was hit! I couldn\u2019t react at all!</p><br/><p>Feeling numerous strong shocks from my back, I continued in the momentum and fell. At the place I fell onto, I became the  character.</p><br/><p>Terrific. That woman is terrific!</p><br/><p>To think that she could throw such a fast blow with that appearance. Just what in the world is she?</p><br/><p>While I was hearing the voice of my disciples in the distance, I take out a tobacco from my breast pocket.</p><br/><p>\u2014 Those were my last memories from yesterday \u2014-</p><br/><p>After that, it seems I did a lot of actions, but I didn\u2019t have any memories of it. It\u2019s still in the area of conjectures, but Lich was probably using my body as he wished.</p><br/><p>My consciousness returned at the morning of the next day.</p><br/><p>My whole body was unbelievably heavy and sluggish.</p><br/><p>They told me that the existence called Lich came out from my mouth like black smoke, or something like that.</p><br/><p>And the one who defeated that Lich was this masked man. I don\u2019t know with what or how he was able to defeat him, but it seems that the real finishing blow was dealt by the blue haired Shen.</p><br/><p>Raidou. The newbie merchant from Tsige huh.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s definitely a lie!</p><br/><p>The conversation with those guys and us, the forest ogres, continues even after returning from the execution place.</p><br/><p>However, it was only the elders and them.</p><br/><p>We couldn\u2019t even hear the outcome.</p><br/><p>In this case, I will keep in secret that I did the Tree Punishment on Raidou. I feel like it would only make the situation more complicated.</p><br/><p>But, why didn\u2019t it work? This hasn\u2019t happened before.</p><br/><p>\u201cShishou, I want to ask something\u201d</p><br/><p>Akua, while waiting for the meeting to end, began speaking to me with a strange tension.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout that guy called Raidou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, uhm\u2026 Later okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>I wanted to answer her question, but it seems that the meeting was over.</p><br/><p>What will be our future treatment? In the worst case, we will become their slaves. In the best case, it would be somewhere around retainers?</p><br/><p>A meeting with the black woman, the dragon woman, and the merchant that had both of them at his sides. It wouldn\u2019t be strange to be forced an impossible order.</p><br/><p>Well, if anything happens, I will take front. Even if the Tree Punishment doesn\u2019t work, it doesn\u2019t mean that I can\u2019t fight.</p><br/><p>If I somehow get that Raidou in a one-on-one, even I should have a chance.</p><br/><p>Also, if I make it a fist fight\u2026</p><br/><p>Magicians are all like that, if you get close and are able to hit them once, they are done for.</p><br/><p>The hard part is to make Raidou enter a one-on-one with conversation skills though. But I will have to do it somehow.</p><br/><p>The one who has the highest ability in combat among the forest ogres is, with no doubts, me.</p><br/><p>Raidou and the others.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t think that we will yield obediently.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

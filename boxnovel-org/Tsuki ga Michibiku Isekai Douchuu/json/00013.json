Bad news, Metal Gear Solid V is out.</p><br/><p>I will soon be going on dangerous infiltration missions to save the world so my speed in translation may be affected. Before I enter this dangerous missions I will try to squeeze out some chapters though.</p><br/><p>But you see, no one can get in the way of my MGS craze\ud83d\ude42</p><br/><p>Anyways, enjoy! ^^</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><br/><p>Persist, me.</p><br/><p>Presently I am facing a sudden turn of events that I can\u2019t understand, and for now I have tried to encourage myself.</p><br/><p>Asora has clearly gotten bigger. It has become more and more into something I can\u2019t understand.</p><br/><p>Wow.</p><br/><p>At the horizon I can see a pitch-black forest. That place was supposed to be a green prairie before. Moreover, another forest was made close to our vicinity.</p><br/><p>Also, a river that looked like it was here from the very beginning, was now flowing. It traversed to the distance and crossed the orcs village and continued heading downstream to somewhere. Maybe there is a sea in the end?</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not an optical illusion.</p><br/><p>I investigated but, physically the topography had expanded and changed as well. The wall that was in the far away distance of Asora, now I have to use [Sakai] to be able to see where it is. The water flow disappears somewhere inside it so in the future it may become even bigger.</p><br/><p>The size may even compete with Hokkaido. I said whatever came to mind. But I think that this place is just too vast to call it a prefecture.</p><br/><p>In its entirety, I get the impression that the vegetation and water has increased. I am worried that more and more it feels like the lands of Japan. There is no houses or paddy fields but it\u2019s just the atmosphere.</p><br/><p>J-Just how unstable is this place. Seriously this place, is it safe to reside in it?</p><br/><p>And then, I lifted up my hands and breathe in. Because I recalled it.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>I woke up in the tent that the orcs had prepared for me.</p><br/><p>When I did that, a woman with black hair was beside me, bowing while pressing three fingers on the floor. (TN: a REALLY formal way of presenting yourself. Mostly when you are greeting your fianc\u00e9)</p><br/><p>In a horribly awkward silence, the girl lifts her head up.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks for the meal, master-sama. Thanks to you I have tasted the experience called full stomach for the first time since I was born\u266b\u201d</p><br/><p>With tears surfacing, she said these words in great joy.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t understand the situation at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait for a second, stay there\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I ignored the girl that was saying something and one-sidedly said so, and for now went out of the tent.</p><br/><p>I was just planning to calm down but in that place I was faced with even more disorder.</p><br/><p>Damn Asora, what is so fun in driving me to a corner when I am already in a confusing situation. If you are going to change the scenery I want you to at least tell me beforehand.</p><br/><p>But, I can\u2019t seem to find an escape to this situation. The time is already late huh, it seemed like no one was close. I have no choice but to return to where that girl is.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s return.</p><br/><p>\u201cWelcome back\u201d</p><br/><p>The only person I can talk to is with this beautiful woman. There is no other choice so I decided to ask her a number of things.</p><br/><p>??</p><br/><p>That girl was the spider.</p><br/><p>It was that full throttle perverted black thing. It eats magic, no matter how much I cut it it regenerates, over that, I could only end in agony.</p><br/><p>To my surprise, she told an incomprehensible thing as \u201cI have made a pact\u201d and deeply lowered her head.</p><br/><p>Pact. From the words I thought it was something that needed the approval of both parties but.</p><br/><p>In reality, it looks like it doesn\u2019t matter. It may be that there is something, but I don\u2019t understand at all.</p><br/><p>Maybe she took my thumb print while I was sleeping and that worked, I really doubt the rules of this world. Ah, I see. That goddess was the one who decided them. Then there is no remedy.</p><br/><p>With my intuition I began approving the words of the girl.</p><br/><p>I could feel that everything was beginning to connect.</p><br/><p>I understood.</p><br/><p>You can\u2019t cancel it and there is no cooling-off. It is an extremely unaffectionate system to the related party.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, tying all that I have said, that I am right now in human form and restraining in front of you is because of the great favor you have given me. I have, for the first time, felt a sensation different from starvation. In all of my life that is to come I will offer you both my heart and body to serve under you\u201d (Spider)</p><br/><p>It must be her true feelings. I can\u2019t imagine the times when she was just a spider driven by her instincts but this was surely not a lie.</p><br/><p>Besides, if I make the conversation turn worse, I would have to face random encounters with this hungered lady. For who knows how many times.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t want to do that again. I really don\u2019t want to. I have, for the first time, experienced facing a bulldozer.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why I nodded. It is the first rule of reality.</p><br/><p>Uooooo!! In this world there are too many forced events, and the development is way too fast!</p><br/><p>This is weird, I had confidence in my skill to walk smoothly in the world though. After all, it was only the self-confidence of a high school student, \u2018a frog in a well\u2019 is what you could say.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way, where is Shen?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I could tell that this is my own tent.</p><br/><p>It must be late at night right now.</p><br/><p>I heard that the time of Asora is connected with the outside so there is no doubt.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf its Shen she is outside on standby\u201d</p><br/><p>E, I was sure that there was no killing intent but.</p><br/><p>I check my surroundings.</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, there is. The one that is just outside the entrance is Shen without doubt.</p><br/><p>It is so late in the night and she is outside on standby huh. She may have some business with me but, I can\u2019t help but have a bad feeling about it.</p><br/><p>The times where she has brought me something that I would feel happy about are practically none.</p><br/><p>But.</p><br/><p>To have been here until now and waited until I woke up. I couldn\u2019t just leave her abandoned there. (TN: Really, I am pretty sure you said no one was around when you went out)</p><br/><p>\u201cCould you call her?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, danna-sama\u201d (TN: a really flirtatious way to call someone, its like calling you hubby)</p><br/><p>\u201cBu!!\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Danna-sama?! What danna-sama?!</p><br/><p>Just a moment ago you were calling me master-sama were you not?! I don\u2019t like that one either though?</p><br/><p>A woman, that for some reason had a strangely transparent black cloth that showed her figures body line, stood up without making a sound.</p><br/><p>Well~ she is refined isn\u2019t she?</p><br/><p>Wait no!</p><br/><p>No good, if I brought these two followers to a town.</p><br/><p>Conspicuous.</p><br/><p>It will be super ultra-conspicuous.</p><br/><p>With feelings anew I watch ane-sama and black hair from the entrance.</p><br/><p>Bob haircut and the color is jet black. Slightly lifted up long slit eyes.</p><br/><p>A white skin that could be mistaken for porcelain, brilliant lips.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a beautiful girl that could be thought of as Japanese. Well as usual, she is taller than me. But still, not as tall as Shen.</p><br/><p>I have been thinking this at the times of Shen and Ema as well but, why is it that the ones that approach me are not human?</p><br/><p>Now that I think about it, she greeted me bowing but I haven\u2019t heard her name.</p><br/><p>Should I call her nameless? Or maybe number two? (TN: Oh god no, she will kill number one if you do that)</p><br/><p>Names that should fit both beautiful girls, not names that should go for unpleasant persons.</p><br/><p>A name, I have to think of a name. If I continue to call them like this, their disposition may come to light after all.</p><br/><p>Talking about disposition, if Shen decides to bring in an enemy to Asora and make me fight it again, I have to think of a suitable place to do it so the residents in here don\u2019t get affected by it.</p><br/><p>If that\u2019s how things are, there is a need to talk with Shen about Asora.</p><br/><p>Also, the city creation has not taken proper form yet but we have to plan for the future and think about the size of it as well.</p><br/><p>There is a lot to do. A mountain of it.</p><br/><p>And also the luggage I brought with me when I was transported here.</p><br/><p>It could be clearly said that it has had zero use.</p><br/><p>Why did I even bring books here? When I search in my memories, thanks to Shen the books I had in my room were all taken away anyways! I thought I had made a good choice but, it just makes me tear up.</p><br/><p>The diary and the pen are doing a great job though, but the need for it is as expected, low.</p><br/><p>Name, examination, lands, name, examination, lands\u2026</p><br/><p>From where should I begin?</p><br/><p>The one I can take care of immediately is the name. Okay then, I will begin from this one.</p><br/><p>And while I am at that I will inspect the surroundings of Asora and look at this worlds actual constructions. And then the plan of city creation.</p><br/><p>Well, beginning from the orcs vicinities, I should just leave a space between villages and it will be fine. Until the city\u2019s planning is properly established there is no need to rush.</p><br/><p>The hands of the orcs are also full with just trying to stabilize their own village. Isn\u2019t that right? Shen is not doing anything excessive right?</p><br/><p>At any rate, if I leave everything to Shen I feel that she will actually try recreating Edo or Kyoto and that is really scary.</p><br/><p>Just like in the ancient times or in the medieval times of my world, she would work them like horses without consideration.</p><br/><p>A riot in Asora is seriously no joke.</p><br/><p>\u201cO~ master, you have woken up\u201d (Shen)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, somehow. It seems that I have done a new pact but, what were you doing?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, I was helping with the pact. It is a lot better than being eaten right? Also, if we don\u2019t do a pact or kill it and just leave it alone, in the times to come, we wouldn\u2019t know when it would jump on us\u201d (Shen)</p><br/><p>Saying this, Shen points at the girl that was once a spider.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s true that I wouldn\u2019t want that. That is one of the reasons I accepted this pact.</p><br/><p>Well, Shen is that\u2026 whatever grows, it goes.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have been blessed as a loyal retainer and am happy\u201d (Spider)</p><br/><p>Shen smiled like saying \u2018it\u2019s not that much\u2019 while the spider was like \u2018I am so happy-desu\u2019 with her face colored.</p><br/><p>Neither of them notice a speck of my ill will.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd, what is it that you need me for? That you are here at this hour must be because of some business right?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s right. Hey, it\u2019s fine now\u201d (Shen)</p><br/><p>She faces towards the entrance and makes a beckoning gesture.</p><br/><p>The one that came in was the fuzzy haired guy.</p><br/><p>O~. This very short and stout body.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a person that is shorten than me! And its face is normal! From what I think!</p><br/><p>Oo~ in this world there is someone that is the same normal as me.</p><br/><p>Now I remember, before the spider appeared, Shen was doing princess carry to someone like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cDwarf?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Shen, the spider girl and dwarf(?) change their facial expression at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, you are really insightful-ja no\u201d (Shen)</p><br/><p>Shen came in as the representative and praised me. The dwarf-san seemed to be surprised that I knew of its race. The spider was nodding.</p><br/><p>Are dwarfs a rare race?</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd furthermore, it\u2019s not a simple dwarf! It\u2019s an ancient race that has made sacred treasures and legendary tools, a dwarf that has the name of elder-yo\u201d (Shen)</p><br/><p>N?</p><br/><p>Does it mean it\u2019s an impressive dwarf?</p><br/><p>Well, it should be rare.</p><br/><p>When I tried to think for a bit, the dwarf took a step forward and brought me back to reality.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is an honor to meet you. As you have said, I am a dwarf-de gozai masu. I am truly grateful that you have saved me\u201d (Dwarf)</p><br/><p>\u201cA, don\u2019t worry. My name is Misumi Makoto. Call me Makoto please. Um\u2026\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cI am sorry for my rudeness!!!! I am called Beren\u201d (Beren)</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks for your courteousness. So, Beren-san. That I have saved you, if my memory serves right, it was Shen that saved you though\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cMu? That\u2019s not it. The moment he was about to be eaten I just brought him to Asora though\u201d (Shen)</p><br/><p>Shen, that was silent and just listening, had interrupted.</p><br/><p>No well, it is normal to think you have saved him with that.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Shen-sama brought me here to hide from that giant spider and\u2026\u201d (Beren)</p><br/><p>He cuts off for a moment. Beren looks at the girl and makes a complicated expression. He was attacked by her so it\u2019s no surprise.</p><br/><p>In a space of it I could feel the eyes of him seeing her as if finding fault. That it was only for a second is as expected from his thick facial expression. Even though it was a person who tried to eat him not too long ago.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd that giant spider, you have taken care of it. I have heard that its curse has been lifted and it has turned into that girl over there\u201d (Beren)</p><br/><p>Moshimoshi? (TL: Hello?)</p><br/><p>It was just a spider that was starving right? Why did it become a fairy tale like that Shen?</p><br/><p>I talk to her with my eyes.</p><br/><p>Well, master-yo. With this it would be resolved swiftly wont it? And it seems we will be able to make these dwarfs our comrades.</p><br/><p>No, you see. You only want to make a katana right?</p><br/><p>They were almost going to be eaten so they should not have any objections-yo. This is just fine.</p><br/><p>The eye exchange ends.</p><br/><p>Ku\u2026 What a wicked woman. I feel a bit of pity for this dwarf.</p><br/><p>When I look at Beren-san, he seemed to have noticed my gaze and continued his talk.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat spider has, since ancient times, devoured everything and then disappears. It was an entity that could be called Calamity. In the past it past devoured works from us and the orcs\u201d (Beren)</p><br/><p>So you even eat metal. Everything is fine with you huh!</p><br/><p>When I look at the girl that was once a spider, the thin waist Japanese beauty turns bashful. So it\u2019s true.</p><br/><p>But it really might be better to just leave the story as it is. As the dwarfs are going to be staying here, it would be best that they think the spider has turned a new flower.</p><br/><p>Well, it\u2019s fine.</p><br/><p>He seems to still want to continue to talk. Let\u2019s hear him out.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so, I have a favor to ask of Makoto-sama, who possesses such a domain\u201d (Beren)</p><br/><p>What is it? Another event flag? I want to seriously head to the town though.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat could it be?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cWe live in the wasteland and we produce tools for others. That we live in such a dangerous place is for the sake of protecting our creations from usurpers such as the black spider. But, that place is just way too barren\u201d (Beren)</p><br/><p>That it\u2019s safe there, it is safe. That place is hard to locate and the ones that try to infiltrate the place are few.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why there are few who would try to steal from them. And it also seems that Shen didn\u2019t even know that the dwarfs had a stronghold there.</p><br/><p>Taking off the fact that it\u2019s a barren land, that place is safe.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are right. The treasures may be safe but the food and materials seem to be scarce\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. And so, the request I am talking about is\u2026\u201d (Beren)</p><br/><p>I stay silent. Well, with how the conversation has moved I already know where he is trying to lead it to though.</p><br/><p>\u201cWill you please accept us here?\u201d (Beren)</p><br/><p>Yeah. Compared to the wasteland, this place is safe and has materials too.</p><br/><p>Furthermore hereafter, with the migration of other races, the knowledge and goods should increase.</p><br/><p>And the ones supervising this world, Shen and the spider that was once a threat. Also, me.</p><br/><p>There is no need to say it.</p><br/><p>Shen is super happy that it wasn\u2019t only one person, she gets to migrate their whole race. It is good that Beren-san doesn\u2019t see it. I have never seen such a happy face on her.</p><br/><p>A girl that has a figure of a Japanese and a calm bearing, slightly licked her lips with her tongue. She also looked as if it was delicious, I mean, she looked happy as well. I have to tell her that she can\u2019t eat the products.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is fine\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cImmediate response?!\u201d (Beren)</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, we do have land so. If you are able to coexist with the orcs then you are free to do whatever\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cT-That is, of course\u201d (Beren)</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a face like saying \u2018is it fine with just that?\u2019 But well, if it\u2019s just living here, I have no big issues with it.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, to cooperate with the construction of the city. Supply us with tools. And, in the future we will also be requesting land rent. By the way, I will have you guys acknowledge that the lord of this place is master\u201d (Shen)</p><br/><p>Shen begins to give out additional requirements one after the other.</p><br/><p>This fellow actually had all of the conditions prepared beforehand.</p><br/><p>\u201cA city huh? The tools and land rent is a matter of course. I don\u2019t mind\u201d (Beren)</p><br/><p>It seems that this Asora looks really comfortable to live in for him. I had the image that dwarfs were pretty stubborn people but Beren that is right in front of me seems to be an understanding person.</p><br/><p>He continuously accepts all of the conditions Shen is putting out.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right-ja. We are planning on creating a city in the future. Of course, I don\u2019t mind it if you guys want to bring in your village over here\u201d (Shen)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026 sounds pretty interesting. On the other side of the mist there is a bountiful land and a city huh. Truly interesting!\u201d (Beren)</p><br/><p>Beren-san seems to be all into the city creation plan. That Shen is lucky.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor the three of you, it\u2019s of course, a weapon. I was also thinking of providing you guys\u2019 armor\u201d (Beren) (TN: Not clear of what he says here. \u304a\u306b\u306f\u3082\u3061\u308d\u3093\u3001\u30fb\u3092\u3055\u305b\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3060\u304d\u305f\u3044\u3068\u3063\u3066\u304a\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f)</p><br/><p>To the spider as well? She must have been a real threat for them. This fellow.</p><br/><p>No. It is true that she was scary.</p><br/><p>To have been said \u2018delicious\u2019 by someone that I tried to kill is a first for me.</p><br/><p>In a sense, it must have been scary that the dwarfs\u2019 brethren also got their creations devoured without any say to it.</p><br/><p>And moreover, it was because she was hungry. It is a lot scarier than any simple and extremely poor evil.</p><br/><p>\u201cFumu, then, it is okay to bring your brethren here. I will make you a path\u201d (Shen)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, then without any delay. I think I will be able to return in one or two days but, will you please wait for me?\u201d (Beren)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, when you finish collecting everything necessary, tell me. When I receive your call I will transport the whole village\u201d (Shen)</p><br/><p>Again with that. How grand. And it\u2019s also the easiest way to moving. The packing could also be done to the minimum as well.</p><br/><p>Just by leaving it inside the house it can be transported huh.</p><br/><p>So is it that? If you use Asora as a relay you would be able to do something close to instant teleport?</p><br/><p>Fumu, in places that we will be stopping often, let\u2019s confirm if Shen is able to create gates there.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen!!\u201d (Beren)</p><br/><p>Beren-san went flying out as if he was a bullet. Even so, as expected.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can talk with him normally\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t feel awkward while I was talking with Beren-san. Maybe I just need tuning at the beginning?</p><br/><p>No, dwarfs are humanoids. It could be that on the other side he was able to understand human language?</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected of master-ja\u201d (Shen)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, impressive-desu\u201d (Spider)</p><br/><p>It seems that\u2019s not it. No, to even be able to talk with a spider is an impressive thing itself. If you can call that \u2018talking\u2019 though.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seemed like he could understand the words that this spider spoke as well. It is truly unbelievable\u201d (Shen)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd that maryoku is so sweet. He is truly the ideal gentlemen-desu wa\u201d (Spider)</p><br/><p>Umu, I am not happy!</p><br/><p>A boyfriend that can be eaten. That kind of context is not going to be popular. Meal boy? I definitely don\u2019t want to become that.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow then, there is actually one thing I want to request master\u201d (Shen)</p><br/>\n</div>"}

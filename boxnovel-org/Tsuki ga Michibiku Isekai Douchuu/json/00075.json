Half of his left hand\u2019s fingers are gone and bleeding like hell. One of the reasons he isn\u2019t thinking clearly.</p><br/><p>Thanks for correcting this raj72616a.</p><br/><p>\u201cAra, the color of the clothes changed. Could it be a countermeasure for us? Even though you should not be a new recruit that has smelled the scent of war for the first time. You are quite the carefree Goddess errand boy huh\u201d</p><br/><p>I ignore the woman named Sofia and prepare myself for battle. I have fought dragons, spiders and skeletons; in terms of fighting I am a bit used to them by now. But against a human being is, as expected, different.</p><br/><p>I am fine when dealing with people like Lime Latte who just know how to make creepy smiles, but I didn\u2019t expect I would fight against people that can create blood thirst resembling that of my sensei. If I can stay in the mental state I was when I killed that idiotic woman, would I be able to create that kind of blood thirst?</p><br/><p>Even if I think about this and that, if I can\u2019t do it, there is no point. There is no need to imagine it, I am already in front of the very people that can achieve it. My head is in a mess and I can\u2019t think properly.</p><br/><p>I changed the color of my coat into red. Behind me there is a forest. It is in my field of vision, but there is quite the distance. If I use the speed attribute, I might be able to shake them off and enter the forest. If it goes well, I will be able to withdraw from here! The red color also increases my resistance against edged attacks, so it works as a countermeasure for that woman as well.</p><br/><p>About the hyumans\u2026 in this occasion, I will ignore them. If casualties appear, go complain to your Goddess.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt may be an act to make us lower our guard, don\u2019t lose your concentration. See, he is trying to do something. I feel a radical magic power convergence\u201d (kid)</p><br/><p>I click my tongue internally at the words of the kid. So he can sense magic activation huh. Then that means there may not be much merits in doing voiceless arias.</p><br/><p>Even so, to not move immediately, are they leisure or maybe just negligent? I hope they are just negligent.</p><br/><p>I was a bit uneasy about using a one shot spell, so I did a chain activation on [Brid] balls and leave them at my sides, I create from 5 on 5.</p><br/><p>I inserted keywords on the Brids to arrange a few things, but I am reaching my limit. I want to quickly go to Academy Town and learn new knowledge. Magic knowledge that can fill up the deep precipice of my understanding in magic in order to comprehend the book Shiki gave me.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake this!\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>The moment I activated them, the balls are drawn to the limit until they become lines and are released on the woman and kid at high speed. At the same time, I turn around and run at full speed to the forest.</p><br/><p>?!</p><br/><p>A wall?!</p><br/><p>In front of me there is a giant wall. A light of some sort is merging and working as a wall. Just a moment ago this wasn\u2019t there. But I can\u2019t just stay standing here. Luckily, the width is just a few meters. If I avoid it and advance, I can manage somehow.</p><br/><p>I had stopped for a second, but soon I resume my running. I do a zigzag and try to evade it, that I am taking my time must be because of my own lack of ability. I want more instinct. Enough so that I can predict these walls that keep appearing one after the other.</p><br/><p>Damn it, even though I have this speed, doing brakes all the time reduces the merit by half.</p><br/><p>\u201cTch, how troublesome\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh~ for an impromptu you were able to create this chain of high-power magic? I thought your fighting experience was the very essence of immaturity, but you are unexpectedly good. Mitsurugi, I am counting on your foothold and obstruction!\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>This extremely strange spectacle of having a wall appear continuously. The forest that should not be impossible to reach to, feels so far now! Moreover, from under my feet a shining thing is sticking out as well. This is\u2026 a sword?! No, just the edge?!</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t understand anything!</p><br/><p>I concentrate on making the barrier at my feet stronger and scatter the edges that are popping out while running.</p><br/><p>Ah~, so difficult to run! At this rate\u2026</p><br/><p>I felt a bit anxious about the obstruction I placed, so I turned my head a bit in order to confirm the situation. At that place\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAhahahaha! This is incredible. Not only is it conceited, it also chases you!\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>\u201cTaking them head on would be a bit heavy huh. Well, there won\u2019t be problems if we divert it. More importantly, Sofia, if that is a secret card of the Goddess, there is something we should do right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know! But that will be when I do a formal greeting on him and he is still alive, okay?!\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>\u2026 It\u2019s, not working as an obstruction. Just what the hell are these guys?</p><br/><p>The rapid-fire Brids are definitely not low in firepower. I have these clothes and these rings so my magic power should be pretty strong. And yet, what is that?</p><br/><p>The kid is probably using a magic barrier to divert the rapid-fire Brids to different locations. Of course, some of the blown off brids end up to where the demons and hyumans are, but it seems he is not doing any follow up for that. How heartless!</p><br/><p>So it is possible to change the length and angle to divert magic huh. When I have time, this is a technique I want to learn. But I don\u2019t have the leisure to observe that kid carefully.</p><br/><p>The woman\u2019s side is doing an unbelievable thing. She is using her sword to cut the rapid-fired brids, dashing like a keen beast to shake off those homing brids and evading left and right. Also, the numerous shining sword-looking things floating in mid-air, I don\u2019t know if those are made by the woman or by the kid, but she is using those swords as \u201cfooting\u201d to perform acrobatic moves, reducing the distance between her and me at a terrifying speed.</p><br/><p>\u2026 You are kidding me right? She is cutting off the magic that is coming at high speed with a giant sword that requires both hands. What kind of monster is that?!</p><br/><p>Moreover, she does that acrobatic-like mid-air sprint so easily!</p><br/><p>Even though I am not the Goddess\u2019 hidden card or anything like that!</p><br/><p>Ah, this wall. They are swords. A lot of swords are intersected to knit a wall. That girl, is she a special magic user or something? A sword magician maybe? The usability is questionable though. Well, I can\u2019t say anything in respect when I am currently surprised by it.</p><br/><p>While I was trying to escape reality by thinking random stuff, she appeared right in front of me. A monster?!</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t she behind me a few moments agoooo?!</p><br/><p>There is such a bullshit hyuman in this world?! No, is she really a hyuman?</p><br/><p>Her skin color and looks may be hyuman but, could it be she is actually a new creation from the demon race?!</p><br/><p>The problem is not only that she caught up with me! She kicked the sword wall, raised her giant sword and dashed towards me!</p><br/><p>\u201cCau~ght you!!\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>Contrary to the light words she said, the figure of the girl wielding that giant sword grew blurry in an instant. The girl who was in mid-air didn\u2019t wait until landing, and just straightforwardly swung her sword at me! I expand a barrier at my front and enhance it with Sakai to confront her attack. It\u2019s not like I don\u2019t belief in the resistance of my armor, but I will do everything I can.</p><br/><p>\u201c?!\u201d</p><br/><p>An incredibly high-pitched sound reverberates and the sword of the girl was bounced upwards. I blocked it. But the barrier was also offset and destroyed! No way, that sword. Don\u2019t tell me that sword has a crazy property like \u201cmagic killer\u201d or something like that right?!</p><br/><p>I wanted to try expanding a barrier again but I won\u2019t make it in time. Her chase and mowing is faster. To be able to do such a feat with an unstable stance, just what kind of body control is that?!</p><br/><p>Just like how I was surprised she was able to destroy my barrier, she was also shocked that her sword was repelled. That means she was pretty sure that attack would decide everything but was stopped. To be able to think that way when doing it with such an outrageous posture.</p><br/><p>This woman, won\u2019t she get astonished or waver? Or is it just that my decision-making is too slow? The ability to instantly decide on your next action at a fight of life and death, I haven\u2019t learnt that before and there is no way I will suddenly be able to do it in real combat.</p><br/><p>What to do? What should I do?!</p><br/><p>I place the [Sakai] to protect only my body, and cross my arms to defend against the attack coming from my left. This time I can only wager on the eldwas. To avoid the worst case scenario, I thought about springing my body back but my reflexes couldn\u2019t follow so I was unable to do it. Rather, to be able to raise my arms is enough to make me wanna praise myself.</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t close my eyes. There is no assurance that she won\u2019t do a follow-up. I resolve myself and prepare for the swing.</p><br/><p>There is no doubt this is an imperfect attack stemming from a crazy posture. Even so, I can\u2019t relax.</p><br/><p>However, it seems I won the bet. It was a dull attack and there was no pain. The part that was hit only felt a bit numb. I wasn\u2019t even sent flying.</p><br/><p>I knew this in an armor that the eldwas are proud of, but to actually block a sword with clothes feels strange.</p><br/><p>This time she landed and looks at me with eyes wide open, taking her distance from me, arriving at a pretty distant place. To do so many movements in mid-air and still be able to land with her two feet. Truly awe inspiring.</p><br/><p>At her side there is the kid. So they have destroyed all the batteries huh. Well, I did set them up thinking only about defense though. Seriously, what are these guys?</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t tell me\u2026 heroes?!</p><br/><p>No, that\u2019s not it. If that were the case, they wouldn\u2019t be with the demon army. What am I thinking?</p><br/><p>If I remember correctly, this girl is called Sofia. The kid, I think the woman called him in the name of a famous sword. Mitsurugi. I feel like I have heard that name before\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWait~ that funny lump, what is it? He is way too amusing. He has ability and movements that aren\u2019t even worth mentioning, and yet, that hardness, reflex, magic power; his standards are on an abnormal level. A mismatched pervert\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>\u201cI also feel that way. Even though he is incredibly strong, he is way too crude. I don\u2019t understand at all\u201d (Mitsurugi)</p><br/><p>\u201cThen provide me cover at least once\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>\u201cI was busy destroying the source of those attacks. Don\u2019t ask for the impossible\u201d (Mitsurugi)</p><br/><p>Are those commentaries about me? I am sorry for being amusing to the level of laughing and an incomprehensible existence. Also, I am glad to have left the batteries stationary there. I think I am the one that needs support the most though not you.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, once we take control, the situation should change. Ghjkop \\ kkjjgf\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, so we are using the ring on this single opponent? At least say when you are going to use it Sofia\u201d (Mitsurugi)</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no other choice right? This kid seems to have received quite the blessings from the Goddess after all\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>Hah? What kind of incantation is \u201cTrample down on the God\u2019s prayer\u201d?</p><br/><p>The latter half of what Sofia said made no sense and left me questioning. Words I haven\u2019t heard before. Are those keywords to activate something? But if I remember correctly, the tools that are filled with magic are normally activated with common language?</p><br/><p>This language is a first for me.</p><br/><p>As if responding her aria, the ring in Sofia\u2019s right hand crumbles. Not break, it was more like, crumbling to a state that would be impossible to restore.</p><br/><p>Just like when I expand Sakai, a mysterious undulating sensation spreads out from the circumference of the crumbled ring.</p><br/><p>With this\u2026 what does it change? It doesn\u2019t seem like the situation has changed at all though. My lifeline which is magic power can still be used without any problems. At the very least, the amount I still have inside me has no problems.</p><br/><p>\u201cUmu. It seems it is a success. With this the tests are done. However, this is interesting. To think that the day would come when we would be able to negate the interference of the Goddess. The worldwide influence she provides can now be changed at our whim\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>Success. Then that means some sort of effect is in place. Damn it, I can\u2019t see what their hand is at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom the beginning you and I were not blessed by it, so there is no demerit. Also, the demons and demon beasts as well. Basically, it is a tool that only has merits when used by someone that\u2019s not hyuman. Not only that, the effect of negating the Goddess blessing seems quite fast\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut the one who created this was\u2026\u201d (Mitsurugi)</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it. There are still Goddess believers here after all\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>Saying that, Sofia looks at me. Removing the interference of the Goddess? Doing something like that. Just what would that hyuman girl gain from it?</p><br/><p>If she were a demon, it would be a topic that has high research value though.</p><br/><p>They\u2026 don\u2019t take their eyes off me. I thought this was my chance to create a gate while they are talking, but if I concentrate and begin my aria, I feel like I will become chopping wood in an instant and that scares me.</p><br/><p>Or more like, why am I on the side of the Goddess? I have gone through terrible things because of that bug you know?</p><br/><p>Ugh, the sensation of my left hand is numbing. This is bad. Should I loosen the bandages? No, that\u2019s no good. I don\u2019t know how much blood I am allowed to bleed. I feel like it is a bad call to worsen the situation if I end up suffering blood loss.</p><br/><p>This is the worst. Can healing magic cure an arm necrosis? Shiki, when I return I am really counting on you. I don\u2019t want to become a one-armed person at this age.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am not on the side of the Goddess\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Even though I know it won\u2019t get through them, I still say it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHoh~, what does that mean?\u201d (Mitsurugi)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, Mitsurugi. You understood those words? That was clearly not common language though\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>Wa? Wait a moment, that girl. Don\u2019t tell me, she is a hyuman? This is bad, I did a blunder once again. Even though I knew my verbal expressions were fantasy-like, this \u201ccomprehension\u201d that was given to me really doesn\u2019t distinct. As expected of a Goddess given ability.</p><br/><p>\u201cRed one, answer. What do you mean when you said you were not on the Goddess\u2019 side? You were without doubt brought to this battlefield by the Goddess. Aren\u2019t you like the two heroes that have been summoned from another world, someone that was brought here to protect Limia? That crazy power, I can only think it was given to you by the Goddess\u201d (Mitsurugi)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, you are not a hyuman?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>While asking the kid if he was a hyuman, I pick up the word Limia.</p><br/><p>Limia, if I remember correctly, it is a major power that is directly confronting the demon race. If they are calling me a protector, does it mean this is a key location for Limia?</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, for now yeah. Right now I have chosen to take the form of a hyuman that\u2019s all. You can talk if I am not hyuman? You get more and more mysterious. From your looks, could you be the half of a hyuman and something else?\u201d (Mitsurugi)</p><br/><p>Pointing a finger at Sofia, the kid makes clear that he is a different living being that has taken the form of a hyuman. What do you mean by me being a half from my looks? Sofia also called me a synthetic beast. I can\u2019t accept that.</p><br/><p>But this kind of situations where they tell me this things as if looking for a fight without any ill intentions, I already got used to it. It doesn\u2019t anger me that much.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have no reasons to fight in this battlefield and I have no intentions on joining hands with the Goddess. How about it? Will you guys please leave this as a misunderstanding and leave me be?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is impossible. I will have you die here. You were summoned here by the Goddess. There is no misunderstanding anywhere\u201d (Mitsurugi)</p><br/><p>\u201cI just have a sort of previous connection with the Goddess that\u2019s all. To kill me here, why is that? Because that hyuman woman called Sofia is allying with the demon race? I won\u2019t be telling anyone that information\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>The kid that was indifferently complying with my words, suddenly becomes silent. He was looking at me with a dumbfounded expression. What is it?</p><br/><p>I thought it was definitely because it would be bad for others to know she was cooperating with the demon race though?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Hyuman woman, you say? Kuku\u2026 Ahahahahaha!\u201d (Mitsurugi)</p><br/><p>The kid suddenly raises his voice and laughs loudly. Did I say something bad?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Why did you suddenly begin laughing?\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>\u201cSofia, listen. This guy, it seems he doesn\u2019t know about you\u201d (Mitsurugi)</p><br/><p>I think this is obvious though. This is the first time I have met her after all. Moreover, she suddenly tried to cut me down.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Huhn~ Well, if he is the same as the heroes, that is a given right?\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut he doesn\u2019t seem to be a hero. And he is pleading for his life. Saying to \u201cplease leave me be\u201d\u201d (Mitsurugi)</p><br/><p>What\u2019s so strange in that? Just, there is no doubt the situation is bad. Because the hostility has increased.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Goddess does incomprehensible things. To think she would throw such an unknowledgeable person to the battlefield. I don\u2019t think she just ran out of pawns though? You, being killed by people you don\u2019t know and people that don\u2019t even know your name. That is not something you would like right? I permit you to tell us your name\u201d (Mitsurugi)</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t intent to be killed. However, in these times, isn\u2019t your side supposed to name themselves first?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I try my best to play strong. Also, if possible, I want to avoid an encounter with this monster. I want information, seriously.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuku, your tongue is first rate huh. Fumu, fine. Then we will start first. The one here who is swinging the number one sword in this world is Sofia Bruga. Her nickname is \u201cDragon Killer\u201d and level 920, a famous woman. And I am Lancer. Well, Sofia calls me Mitsurugi most of the time though\u201d (Mitsurugi)</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026.. Eh?</p><br/><p>Sofia Bruga? Dragon Killer?</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t that the name of the previously strongest level in the guild? Moreover, Lancer, that name, if I remember correctly, is the name of the dragon that was killed by Sofia isn\u2019t it? That\u2019s right, if I remember correctly, his nickname was Mitsurugi.</p><br/><p>Moshimoshi? Moshimoooo~shi!</p><br/><p>There is absolutely no reason for such a big fish to aim at my neck!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I am Raidou. A merchant\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I barely manage to name myself. However, the waves in my heart are not showing any signs of calming down. To be attacked by the highest peak of hyumans and the previous comrade of Tomoe. This situation is something I still can\u2019t put together in my mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cRaidou\u2026 huh. Saying you are a merchant, such an obvious lie-\u201d (Mitsurugi)</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph~, Raidou huh. You have finished introductions right? Once again, I am Sofia Bruga. Just as you see, I am an adventurer that is trying out being on the demon\u2019s side. And, the person that will be killing you\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>Sofia interrupts the words of Lancer and announces her intent to kill me. This woman, just what is she thinking? If you are rising up against the Goddess, I feel like we could become friends, but why is it that it turned into killing me?</p><br/><p>\u201cSofia, I was in the middle of talking. Then the so called Raidou, this is sayonara. You have seen something that shouldn\u2019t have been seen after all\u201d (Mitsurugi)</p><br/><p>You were the ones who told me.</p><br/><p>Faster than his words were finished, in the surroundings of Lancer and in my own, as well as in the sky, swords created by him were beginning to appear.</p><br/><p>It is a situation where it is not the appropriate time to talk.</p><br/><p>This makes me laugh. It really makes me laugh.</p><br/><p>This unreasonable checkmate, like hell I will let it! Not being able to depend on the companions that I finally obtained, and die without anyone knowing. Like I will let that happen.</p><br/><p>I won\u2019t think about holding back anymore. Or more like, I have been surprised left and right and have had no chance to hold back or anything!</p><br/><p>No matter what, I will create a chance and escape!</p><br/><p>Blood has been coming out too much and it is worsening my state. Damn Goddess. Calling me at a crazy place. I have decided to learn a way to go against her summoning as my utmost priority. I wonder how far the Academy teaches in regards to summoning topics.</p><br/><p>Even when doing all this, that bug didn\u2019t say anything to me. Is she really looking? Say something at the very least!</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, I am coming. Your crazy defensive power should be gone now that the Goddess\u2019 interference has disappeared. It will become a simple massacre now\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>Ah, so that\u2019s what she meant with \u201cinterference\u201d.</p><br/><p>That means, she called me all the way here no questions asked and now she is unable to do anything? No, it is because she can\u2019t do anything that she called me here? Uh\u2026 which one is it?</p><br/><p>No matter which one it is, how stupid of her. As expected of bug Goddess, she is an idiot. Instead of saying \u201cI found you\u201d say \u201cI want you to do something\u201d. I would totally run the opposite direction of her words though.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems the heroes are being cornered by the demon general. To remove the remains of the Goddess in here as well is not a bad idea\u201d</p><br/><p>It seems this world has an Anti-Goddess faction. It reliefs me quite a bit and at the same time I am amazed that there is an anti-force in the world she manages.</p><br/><p>I am a bit interested in the heroes though. Tsukuyomi-sama told me to treat them well after all.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s just, my life is foremost. I am sorry but, you heroes manage something by yourself.</p><br/><p>Anyways, these idiots, they finally lowered their guard.</p><br/><p>I feel their atmosphere has slightly slackened. They must have confidence in the effects of that ring.</p><br/><p>They are free to believe I was being enhanced by the Goddess\u2019 interference. Even if I deny it, they wouldn\u2019t listen to my words anyways. They are confident they can defeat me now.</p><br/><p>But well~ that won\u2019t be happening.</p><br/><p>Unlike before, I am going to \u201cstrengthen\u201d after all.</p><br/><p>Being in a battle stance, while feeling anger, I take off the rings left in my left hand and in my right hand. I take off all of my rings.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

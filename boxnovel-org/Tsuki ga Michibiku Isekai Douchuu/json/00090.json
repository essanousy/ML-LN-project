But your corrections are on the level of harassment. Bullying I say, this is bullying already. I will sue you all!</p><br/><p>P.S: It\u2019s a joke, don\u2019t take it seriously. Keep pointing out errors.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, Hibiki and the others were looking for weapons and were in the middle of heading to Tsige?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Our original plan was to use the gold highway and teleport until reaching Tsige, but we had some circumstances and have used ships and inconspicuous routes to transport until here\u201d</p><br/><p>In the highway with people, 5 persons were walking.</p><br/><p>The sun is still high up and with the sparse number of people in this highway, one can tell that it isn\u2019t used that often.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s the shortest route that connects Koran to Tsige. At both sides there are a number of mountains, forests, lakes. To fulfill requests and train their skills, the adventurers that live in Tsige head to those places.</p><br/><p>It has been 2 days since Mio and Hibiki met.</p><br/><p>Mio while still not knowing that Hibiki\u2019s an otherworldler, she is being taught various knowledge about how to cook marine products by Hibiki. And Mio also visited numerous restaurants and passed her days eating things she has tasted for the first time. Right now she is accompanying Hibiki to her objective Tsige by Hibiki\u2019s suggestion and so they are now walking along in the highway like this.</p><br/><p>Hibiki has not revealed Mio her birthplace and that she is a hero. Hitting it off with Mio who wants to recreate food, she talks about the knowledge she has of food in her previous world.</p><br/><p>The group of the Limia hero is travelling incognito while vigilant of their surroundings just in case, but because of the death of one of their comrades, they are fatigued in spirit so noticing that the conversations with Mio were a good diversion, all except the person herself, silently consented Mio accompanying them.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am sorry to interrupt in the middle of your conversation but, can you please give me a bit of your time?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Mio and Hibiki had begun conversing about cooking, the magician who was silently walking, Wudi, cuts into the conversation. Because from the few days accompanying them, he knows that when the two of them begin talking about cooking, they don\u2019t finish for a long time. He thought that it was better to first digest the things that must be asked and the questions they had. His decision was the correct one.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it Wudi?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cMake it short. Today I want to ask about drop-lid simmering-desu kara\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, Mio-dono. This may be a late question but, just what in the world are you? A cook, an adventurer or a merchant? Even though you did quite the shopping in Koran, you are not holding anything. You also didn\u2019t have a carriage. I haven\u2019t heard of a spell that one person can use to store that many goods\u201d (Wudi)</p><br/><p>Mio isn\u2019t that used to be called a cook. That also goes for being treated as a merchant and an adventurer. It\u2019s like when throws away the world and lives long years of retirement, like a rich daughter secluded in her room. She gave off this aura that she is not used to this world yet.</p><br/><p>Even so, she is traveling alone like this and has travelled from Tsige to Koran and she is accompanying them on the way back. For Wudi there\u2019s something that doesn\u2019t fit. He had some bad feeling.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I am a person who is currently interested in cooking and I have registered as an adventurer. Also, I am part of a company. If you ask me what am I, that is my only answer\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 What a jumbled personal history. You say you are an adventurer but, you are not forming a party with anyone?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was Bredda. While he consented travelling together with Mio, he is cautious of her. He didn\u2019t go as far as thinking that the demon race has expanded their influence up to this point, but even so, as long as he is traveling while protecting the hero, his approach isn\u2019t wrong.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, because the levels don\u2019t match or something like that. I actually wanted to party with Waka-sama, but since there\u2019s too much difference and because he is right now far away. The person who is closest to my level is someone called Tomoe-san who is in the same company as me, but it is not on the level where we can form a party so\u2026 Ah, that\u2019s right. I was originally a bodyguard of Waka-sama, so I am probably a bodyguard as well\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>With no malice or anything of the like, Mio answers Bredda\u2019s question disinterested. Depending on the points of view, this could also be taken as feigning ignorance.</p><br/><p>In truth, she really is not partying with anyone. The person she wants to party with, Makoto, is in level 1, and even the one who is the closest, Tomoe, is over level 1,300. Mio who is in level 1,500, isn\u2019t able to party with anyone, so it can\u2019t be helped.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis may be rude but, what is the level of Mio-dono?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry. Waka-sama has nailed onto me that I can\u2019t tell other people my level without a reason, so I can\u2019t answer. In exchange, I won\u2019t ask for your levels, so please do forgive me\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Wudi, and also Bredda! This is not an interrogation, so let\u2019s go with a more fun mood! We are doing a fast pace in the shortest route, but even so, she is still a person travelling with us!\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Hating the fact that the mood was getting bad, Hibiki scolds her two companions.</p><br/><p>The two of them apologize and obediently step back. It was not their intention to make the mood bad.</p><br/><p>In the route from Tsige to Koran that Tomoe and Mio planned to advance through has a number of hyuman and demi-human settlements, a roundabout route that takes several days. In contrast, the one that the five of them are walking in right now is a slightly steep and certainly the shortest route, where the adults could use magic to assist them to get through it in a single day. On top of not being able to pass with a carriage, there are chances to encounter mamonos, but if you are an adventurer, this route is a choice. Taking into account the girl Chiya who has a questionable amount of stamina, this route would take them at least 2 days to reach Tsige.</p><br/><p>\u201cHibiki, thank you. By the way, this is something I thought after the talk of level, but Hibiki and the others are reasonably strong-desu yo ne?\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Well, I think we are able to put good fight\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Bredda holds in his growing anger and Hibiki answers Mio\u2019s question. That reply had emotion mixed and the faces of Hibiki\u2019s party get slightly clouded.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see\u2026 I normally don\u2019t do this, but I am accompanying you guys while being cautious of the surroundings. And it seems that something unusual is heading towards us-desu. Is it fine to leave it to you guys? Or do you want me to help you?\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t joke around. I don\u2019t feel anything\u201d (Wudi)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I also don\u2019t feel anything around\u2026\u201d (Chiya)</p><br/><p>Wudi and Chiya refuted Mio\u2019s words. The two magicians had a hostile perception spell they were expanding in shifts. Saying something like that, Chiya who was resting, expands the spell again but in the effective range there was no reaction.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is being expanded a bit wide so I can see why. Ah, there wasn\u2019t the need to try perceiving it. See, there it is\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Mio points out at the far mountain range.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026 is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe wind is raging about?\u201d</p><br/><p>There, many trees were dancing in the sky. And the forest was visibly shaking.</p><br/><p>The sound had not yet reached, but it was clear that something abnormal was occurring. And the abnormality was increasing its speed as it headed towards Hibiki and the others.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow do you understand-desu ka? And so, what will you do?\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cMio-san, do you know what that is?!\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were able to perceive that\u2026 from this distance? Isn\u2019t that impossible\u2026\u201d (Wudi)</p><br/><p>\u201cI am not really sure but\u2026 it is probably a bug type mamono that has mutated in the wasteland and has crossed the mountains. It happens from time to time-desu\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Mio ignores Wudi and answers Hibiki\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>\u201cA mamono from the wasteland?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bredda was clearly agitated. Even though they were thinking about trying out the wasteland after preparing their equipment in Tsige, they didn\u2019t expect that they would encounter a mamono before reaching the town.</p><br/><p>In the time they were talking, from the forest, the mamono doesn\u2019t change its direction and continues charging at them.</p><br/><p>It will soon come in contact with the perception spell of the hero party.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIncredibly strong! And also big!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do Hibiki?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Mio-san. The thing that is heading here\u2026 is it stronger than the black calamity spider?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, spider?\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, a hungry spider monster. Don\u2019t you know about it?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cI do know about it but\u2026 Well, if you ask me which one is stronger, I have to say the spider is stronger-desu ne. But, is there a need to compare them?\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>For Mio, the spider or in other words herself, hasn\u2019t fought anyone seriously until meeting Makoto. That is to say, what\u2019s the point of comparing strength when it wasn\u2019t even clear?</p><br/><p>Even so, there\u2019s no doubt that if she compares herself before her pact (taking out the hunger) and fought with her original strength, there\u2019s no doubt she would win against that thing charging at them. That\u2019s why she answered Hibiki like that.</p><br/><p>It isn\u2019t wrong. But the difference between the spider Mio is taking into account and the one Hibiki uses as measure, is what will make Hibiki do an incorrect decision.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat means we are enough. Everyone, we will be fighting so, prepare!\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Hibiki unsheathes her sword. Matching this, the other three prepare their fighting stances.</p><br/><p>(Ara, they are really doing it? Even though it is clearly stronger. This people, are they the type who die an early death when entering the wasteland? That\u2019s troubling-wa ne. Well, if Hibiki seems to be in danger, I just have to save her so there no real problem-desu wa ne) (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. Then I wish you good luck. If you think it gets bad, say so okay?\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Practically at the same time as Mio says so, a strong wind is raised in the surroundings. She jumps gently and sits down on a tree branch a bit faraway while resting her chin on one hand.</p><br/><p>There, something that had 4 legs extending from its abdomen, supporting its body and from its upper half there were two giant characteristic scythes in the place of its arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cA praying\u2026 mantis?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. Just like how Hibiki said, there was a giant monster there which was probably based on a praying mantis. Its height is over 3 meters.</p><br/><p>Without even a single instant\u2026</p><br/><p>It did an action that clearly told that the objective of the praying mantis was not the hero party. It does a swipe with its giant scythes that scatters the obstacles and heads onto the hero party.</p><br/><p>(Ara)</p><br/><p>Seeing the horizontal swipe of those scythes that cut off the surrounding leafs in an instant, Mio notices something.</p><br/><p>(I see. It\u2019s a variation that was weakened and got possessed by a wind spirit. From its size, it most likely ate a lot after that. And so, because it was troubled by food, it crossed the mountains. It would normally be a case where an emergency request is made in Tsige and gets noisy) (Mio)</p><br/><p>Mio is in a place outside the range of its attack and observes the praying mantis calmly.</p><br/><p>She has done requests in the wasteland and has experience protecting adventurers she accompanies so she knows how to act in this situations.</p><br/><p>Honestly speaking, taking into account the boost that Tsige has received because of Tomoe and Mio, Hibiki\u2019s group is about third place in Mio\u2019s eyes. She doesn\u2019t know about their level, but considering their survival abilities and instant decision making, they are just one of those parties that has some skills and has somehow not been buried.</p><br/><p>\u201cBredda!\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cRoger!\u201d (Bredda)</p><br/><p>With Hibiki\u2019s voice, Bredda takes a step forward and stops the scythe attack with a wide width sword and deviates it.</p><br/><p>(Heh~, it is quite the well done defense. But well I have seen their weapons and I have to say, they have quite the poor equipment\u2026 Eh?!) (Mio)</p><br/><p>Mio\u2019s surprise.</p><br/><p>That reason was Bredda. Mio instantly understood that his sword was already not in a state where it could be used properly, but maybe because Bredda still didn\u2019t understand that, he was preparing himself to receive the other incoming scythe with his sword.</p><br/><p>Moreover, it looked like he didn\u2019t notice the difference in nature of the attack at all.</p><br/><p>Seeing how low their observation ability is, Mio clicks her tongue. It seems like she was overestimating Hibiki and the others and has been left disappointed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdiot! Evade it!\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Without any other choice, Mio warns him.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>From Bredda\u2019s look, it seems like he didn\u2019t take heed of Mio\u2019s words. The reason he let those words slip was because Hibiki was aiming for a counter.</p><br/><p>Flash.</p><br/><p>Bredda takes on the second attack of the praying mantis.</p><br/><p>But the result will not be the same as last time.</p><br/><p>The right scythe had passed through.</p><br/><p>Bredda\u2019s sword gets torn in two and without stopping, it cut through his left shoulder that was protected by metal like it was paper.</p><br/><p>The heavy armor young man coughs fresh blood and falls face up.</p><br/><p>His eyes were not filled with despair, but surprise. How pitiful that sight was.</p><br/><p>But he is still not dead. The healing light of Chiya who is in charge of recovery envelops Bredda. Wudi\u2019s aria doesn\u2019t stop and the battle is just begin, or at least that\u2019s how it was supposed to go.</p><br/><p>\u201cBredda!! No\u2026 M-Mio-san, I am sorry but please!\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Just like that.</p><br/><p>Unrest runs through Wudi and Chiya.</p><br/><p>Mio also gets surprised by the unexpected words. It\u2019s true that Bredda suffered severe injuries, but he is still able to continue fighting. Or more like, if he doesn\u2019t get up somehow, it is certain that everyone will die.</p><br/><p>For her to change her thinking to running because of this, is way too fast.</p><br/><p>Of course, there is no way for Mio to know this, but it was because Naval\u2019s death had become a heavy trauma in Hibiki. Outside it looks like she had already gotten over it, but in reality it was far from that.</p><br/><p>Actually, the slight escapism of Hibiki to her previous world had something to do with the cooking discussion she had with Mio.</p><br/><p>The normal Hibiki, after seeing the ability of Mio in the beach, she would have answered her questions while asking her to have a bout with her. And yet, she answered all of Mio\u2019s questions and just conversed about cooking. Because of the peaceful conversations, she must have unconsciously felt peace of mind.</p><br/><p>For the mamono, the people\u2019s circumstances are totally not its business.</p><br/><p>Mio, while thinking about the unexpected request of reinforcement this early, moves at high speed to the vicinity of where Bredda is fallen.</p><br/><p>\u201cHibiki, you have disappointed me. How pathetic. If you are weak, understand that you are weak and evade the danger. It\u2019s a bother-desu. Those two over there, I leave the treatment of that knight to you\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Hibiki\u2019s shoulders make a big tremble.</p><br/><p>\u201cGeez. For a mere insect to think he is allowed to devastate the forest. How will you compensate if with this the number of mushrooms and fruits lower?\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Beating its fang and making an obnoxious sound, the mamono didn\u2019t show any signs of answering Mio\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>She stopped the swung scythe with her folding fan, no, not only that, she repelled it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWa!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDie\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>She swipes her folding fan horizontally. She didn\u2019t even pay attention to whose voice it was.</p><br/><p>Mio easily cuts the praying mantis in two along with the forest behind it.</p><br/><p>The mamono that had the upper half imitating that of a hyuman and the lower that was of an insect had separated.</p><br/><p>\u201cDone. With this you can even get raw materials from it right?\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>To not have words must refer to this kind of situations. That praying mantis was without doubt a strong one with clear presence and she defeated it like if she were taking care of a hoodlum in the road.</p><br/><p>Even though she hasn\u2019t sweated at all in the battle, Mio fans her face with her opened folding fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs the knight fine?\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, ehm, yes. I think we will somehow be able to close the wound\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. Then there won\u2019t be any need to assist right? Hibiki, help in dismantling\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cMio-san!!\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>The distressed words of Hibiki didn\u2019t reach in time.</p><br/><p>Without any time to turn back, Mio\u2019s back was slashed.</p><br/><p>Losing her posture, Mio steps forward several times. There was no scream.</p><br/><p>Flapping its wings at a speed that eyes couldn\u2019t catch properly, it made its body hover.</p><br/><p>\u201cMio\u2026san?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Hey, Hibiki\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>The tone that was being directed at Hibiki was clearly low. Remotely different compared to the time at the beach.</p><br/><p>If Makoto saw this he would raise his hands in surrender. That\u2019s how dangerous the current anger of Mio is.</p><br/><p>The praying mantis that had its body bisected, had gone mad and continued to slash at Mio\u2019s back. But Mio was showing no signs of being affected. Of course, there was no blood and unlike the viciousness of the attacks, it was quite peaceful.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs my kimono loosening?\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Uhm\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ragged, Mio-oneechan\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I see\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Taking the place of Hibiki who was having troubles saying it, Chiya explains her the situation. Mio puts her folding fan in her bosom. She breathed deeply and exhales.</p><br/><p>And then she turns and faces the praying mantis. There, a domain of two giant scythes were raging.</p><br/><p>And yet\u2026</p><br/><p>Mio thrusts both of her arms without hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 inseeect!!\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Grabbing the left scythe with one hand, she ties its other scythe whole with the darkness that was gushing out of her right palm.</p><br/><p>Thinking that the darkness had gone into the praying mantis\u2019 arm, the arm that was wrapped up in tight muscles had been instantly sliced into thousand pieces and fallen to the ground. Hibiki and the others gulp their breaths. The mamono makes a painful shriek.</p><br/><p>But Mio doesn\u2019t stop at just that.</p><br/><p>With her open right hand, she firmly grabs the remaining scythe that was grabbed with her left.</p><br/><p>And then, with Chiya\u2019s scream in the background\u2026</p><br/><p>She cuts it into thousand pieces.</p><br/><p>With the slender arms of a girl.</p><br/><p>She does that to a mamono that is praised for its strong build.</p><br/><p>To the prided arm that had a scythe.</p><br/><p>Once again, an inhuman shriek reverberates around the surroundings.</p><br/><p>Losing its lower body and its two arms\u2026</p><br/><p>The mamono had already noticed its own demise. But even so, it still tried to cling to life and with its flying ability that was still left, it tried to escape from the fight.</p><br/><p>However, even that was not possible.</p><br/><p>Mio\u2019s right hand was still holding the mamono\u2019s arm. Its left arm\u2019s scythe was cut in thousand pieces and thrown away, but her right hand was still holding its arm.</p><br/><p>Increasing the strength of its flapping, the praying mantis that had already lost its original form, created a gale while trying to escape.</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>The giant body is send flying in the air in a form that it didn\u2019t wish to. Mio had raised it with one hand. And just like that, she smashed it to the ground. The ground that had received the body of the mamono, showed a fissure.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow dare you do that to the kimono Waka-sama praised!!\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>The lower body that was lying powerless and the upper body that was being smashed, were wrapped by darkness at the same time.</p><br/><p>Even though it was darkness created by magic, a part of it makes you think it\u2019s a living being. The wriggling darkness begins to expand and envelops that giant body, and after that, it slowly gets smaller.</p><br/><p>In time, the darkness disappears in midair. There was nothing left.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Ah\u2026 Because I continue letting my guard down. Can the kimono be fixed?\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Changing into a troubled face that one would even think it\u2019s not the same person, Mio looks at the state of her back. However, Hibiki and the others had no words, and were only overwhelmed by the being that was on a whole different level.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo good. As expected, this is not the time to be leisurely returning\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Mio seems to be pondering about something.</p><br/><p>(Mu, thought transmission? Is she talking to someone?)</p><br/><p>Wudi who had left Bredda\u2019s treatment to Chiya, goes to where Hibiki is and while confirming her state, he notices that Mio\u2019s pondering look was because she was talking to someone and he had taken an interest in it.</p><br/><p>In time, Mio faces in the direction of the three.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have decided to hurry and return to Tsige. I can\u2019t just leave you behind so, please do forgive me\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Darkness envelops the three.</p><br/><p>A sound of powerless falling reverberates.</p><br/><p>Mio who had taken away the consciousness of Hibiki and the others, confirms their state and once again connects the thought transmission.</p><br/><p>(Tomoe, I have taken down everyone. I am counting on you to get us to Tsige-desu wa) (Mio)</p><br/><p>(I am not a taxi-ja ga na) (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>(Taxi? A word I still don\u2019t know of huh. Didn\u2019t I tell you that this has to do with my learning of Japanese food?) (Mio)</p><br/><p>(Ah, that you did-ja na. Well, if it\u2019s about that, I will cooperate. Is the gate of Tsige fine?) (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>(Yeah) (Mio)</p><br/><p>In the place where an intense fight had taken place, a number of presences disappeared.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

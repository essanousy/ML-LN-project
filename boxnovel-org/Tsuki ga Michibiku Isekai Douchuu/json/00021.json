Really, the way Tomoe talks is so hard to translate\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2013</p><br/><p>Good grief. It should be fine for waka to be a little gentler.</p><br/><p>With how he is, in the generation of Koumon-samas he would be in the mean old man type.</p><br/><p>The wise and intellectual type of Koumon-donos are more to my taste.</p><br/><p>If I think like that then the cast in the new memories of waka are to my taste.</p><br/><p>I would like waka to stick his head into troubles a bit more.</p><br/><p>In the matter of the guild and the matter of the market as well, waka noticed both of them but he tried to ignore them.</p><br/><p>If he does that then there won\u2019t be any incidents and nothing will happen. If it weren\u2019t for my quick-wittedness I don\u2019t know what would have happened.</p><br/><p>That is no good. We won\u2019t be able to reform the world. Then \u2018it ends in something petty\u2019 and I won\u2019t be able to take out my katana.</p><br/><p>Even though I had finally gotten something similar made by the elder dwarfs, wait that\u2019s too long, eldwarfs in short.</p><br/><p>Mio had done a good job with her foolish behavior. That is truly a \u2018Hachibe-san\u2019, careless and with normal equipment but someone who you can\u2019t underestimate.</p><br/><p>And now if only waka would get serious we would be able to enter the \u2018Middle Age\u2019s World Reformation Arc\u2019 without any problems.</p><br/><p>But I am now made to do night guard at the carriage while hiding my presence.</p><br/><p>There is the misfortune that I won\u2019t be able to have a meal but tonight is the night where I can expect a development to occur.</p><br/><p>When I think like that, fumu, I feel that I should thank waka for this order.</p><br/><p>Anyways, I am still investigating the way to produce uncooked rice, and my chopstick skills are still not at a satisfactory level. Regarding the katana I am still investigating it thoroughly, the sword I have right now is a sword in the form of a katana that has its cutting edge concentrated at one side of it.</p><br/><p>The basics of katana-making are still in the middle of close investigation so there is no helping it. Waka has gone with his parents a number of times to a town called Seki for the \u2018Hamono festival\u2019 and has stayed over there. I will try to investigate the memories that relate to those times to get the knowledge I want.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a lifesaver that waka is a person with lots of miscellaneous knowledge. He seems to be the type that will investigate things that interest him. That he begins his investigations from scratch is truly a habit that fits my convenience. I sincerely thank you-ja no.</p><br/><p>In my breast pocket I have \u2018My Chopsticks\u2019 but I am still too unskilled to use them.</p><br/><p>As I thought, my first meal should really be a Japanese style meal. And one day I will be able to show off my skill with chopsticks that rival a knife and fork.</p><br/><p>In a sharp and magnificent way!</p><br/><p>As I thought, I should raise orcs that are specialized on making Japanese style food. So that when I feel like eating a Japanese style meal I don\u2019t have to ask waka to make it. To ask waka to make it is, as expected, a bit too much of a stretch for me who is a slave.</p><br/><p>I cast a glance to the cargo.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s the fruits that were in Asora. It seems that they are the exact same food from waka\u2019s world. So we had waka decide if they were edible or not.</p><br/><p>Every one of them was filled with vitality and there were many who were incredibly juicy. Their taste was also extremely good.</p><br/><p>As expected from the fruits that can survive the superior and harsh world of waka, they are truly filled with vigor.</p><br/><p>In an occasional whim I tried to recreate the things that I have heard from waka and have seen in his memories, right now I am barely \u2018crawling\u2019.</p><br/><p>Because the maryoku in the air is zero after all, and it doesn\u2019t work with the release of inherent maryoku. If it\u2019s only the appearance I am able to replicate it.</p><br/><p>We have taken a big amount of ripe things from different varieties and for now there is not a single one that is going bad. They are all still lively-ja.</p><br/><p>\u201cMu, should I get moving?\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Completely understanding their numerical strength, I also grasped their habits and some of them have begun showing movements that tell me they were in an organization of some sort.</p><br/><p>From the people\u2019s movement proficiency I am able to understand their patterns but the ones tonight feel a bit rough.</p><br/><p>They have a bit of coordination.</p><br/><p>But, I am a supreme dragon, an existence that can be counted. Of course, the ones who challenge me all belong to the top class.</p><br/><p>Thinking in that way, these guys may be pretty competent.</p><br/><p>If I were to consider that.</p><br/><p>Right now I am just delighted that I will be able to fight with my katana like a samurai.</p><br/><p>However, this appearance is an appearance that was \u2018taken\u2019 after completing the pact with waka.</p><br/><p>There is no error in saying that compared to the past, my power has increased.</p><br/><p>Waka had to go through the trouble of asking the dwarfs to make a tool that restraint him but, I have no such counter-measure on my body.</p><br/><p>Now that I think about it, the preparations of fighting with someone, honestly, having waka as the opponent doesn\u2019t work as a reference.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s better if I don\u2019t count Mio either.</p><br/><p>If that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to be\u2026 I pity them.</p><br/><p>These guys will have to become my practice partners in my training to \u2018hold back\u2019.</p><br/><p>Two are keeping watch and four are coming to steal huh.</p><br/><p>I am thankful.</p><br/><p>Waka told me to please not slaughter everyone and gazed at me with slightly serious eyes. Even if I mess up my adjustments I still plan for those two to somehow live through this.</p><br/><p>From the four of them, two of those took the lead.</p><br/><p>They are planning on getting their hands on the carriage by infiltrating it. This is a good time huh.</p><br/><p>In the darkness without making a single sound .</p><br/><p>I stood beside the carriage with katana in hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy my, what business do you have with our carriage?\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>I will speak with them in an extremely friendly manner.</p><br/><p>They all stop their movements at the same time and their gazes all concentrated on me. Along with their bloodlust and caution.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t intent to instill unrest in them with my friendly voice but, to have such thoughts right now is pointless.</p><br/><p>My golden serpent eyes were drowning in the excitement of battle. They were fierily gazing at them.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>No words huh. I see that they are having a conversation only with their eyes.</p><br/><p>It seems that there is no room for negotiations. That\u2019s fine, it\u2019s the so called \u2018no questions asked\u2019 huh. You damn ronins*! (TN: wandering samurais that don\u2019t have a master)</p><br/><p>The lookouts don\u2019t show signs of moving.</p><br/><p>The two that were close to the carriage had something short and glittery in their hands. The two that were far away threw something soundlessly from their hands!</p><br/><p>I catch one of the two knives and the other one I evade it. To the flying things that were coming at me, I use the scabbard to block them.</p><br/><p>Light and also slow.</p><br/><p>They are not even worth the talk.</p><br/><p>The moment the next knife was about to reach me, the knife that I had evaded turned around and shot at me once more. In an angle that was practically screaming at me to kick it.</p><br/><p>I complied with its wish and without placing my body weight in it I kicked relying on speed alone. I will return the knife to your hand!</p><br/><p>With a dull sound, the man was send flying to the sky.</p><br/><p>I seriously held back though? He has certainly broken now. I felt that it would be a bit bad to swing my katana but it\u2019s true that it\u2019s better to test it out.</p><br/><p>\u201cFumu\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>There shouldn\u2019t be any problems if I just aim at their weapons.</p><br/><p>\u201cNa!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Trying to open the distance I do a step backwards. At the same time, I target the blade part of the dagger that the frozen man had in hand and sweep horizontally.</p><br/><p>He truly couldn\u2019t react at all. He probably didn\u2019t even notice that I had jumped behind him. He must be thinking I have disappeared. So that is the reason for your frozen state huh, how unskilled.</p><br/><p>The voice of the man suddenly became high-pitched with the surprise of his prey being so close to him.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s almost like he didn\u2019t even feel that I have cut him. The efficiency of my body with the weapon is too good. You eldwarfs, I am really looking forward to the time when you are able to create a real katana, kukuku.</p><br/><p>Then\u2026</p><br/><p>Dosa*</p><br/><p>N? What sound is that?</p><br/><p>When I checked it out, at that place\u2026</p><br/><p>The man that was screaming in fright, his top chest \u2018portion\u2019</p><br/><p>In that place there was a cut line and a body with his whole top missing.</p><br/><p>Wow, to think it would be this efficient?!</p><br/><p>No good! The unrest will carry over to the other four that are remaining. Then there won\u2019t be any person to talk and all of them will try to flee.</p><br/><p>I will not be able to interrogate them!!</p><br/><p>The lookouts had already distanced themselves significantly. With how things are going it might become a commotion.</p><br/><p>I have no choice. Let\u2019s capture the two that are here for now!</p><br/><p>I hold my katana in reverse. I should have done as waka said and used the reverse blade of the katana huh.</p><br/><p>They had their backs turned without any shame and were escaping, one of them is a woman huh. I can\u2019t make out their faces. They have cloths wrapped around it.</p><br/><p>If I am to capture one it would be better if it\u2019s the woman, that way waka would be happy as well. With one glance I could tell it was a woman with big breast. It was a style that brought discomfort with the black clothes she had on.</p><br/><p>Well, waka was saying that the girls were beautiful over and over even when they weren\u2019t that beautiful. It may be that he is thirsting for a woman.</p><br/><p>Even if I say that, he hasn\u2019t requested any \u2018attending\u2019 from us. Waka is quite a mysterious person.</p><br/><p>Wait!</p><br/><p>Won\u2019t waka call me an evil magistrate again if I capture the woman?!</p><br/><p>No, if its waka that\u2019s what he would do!</p><br/><p>Kuu~! What an ingenious trap. To utilize the feelings I have for waka.</p><br/><p>As expected of waka. N, wait. I feel like something is wrong here\u2026</p><br/><p>Well, let\u2019s not think about the complicated stuff. For now let\u2019s let the woman escape and capture the other one.</p><br/><p>I place a bit of strength and kick the ground. It\u2019s obvious that our speeds are different so this was good enough to catch up.</p><br/><p>I stand in front of the black clothed one without chest and hit him in the solar plexus.</p><br/><p>The one that was few distances away turned around but I pretend to take out my katana.</p><br/><p>That fellow must have seen the scene a few moments ago so.</p><br/><p>With an excessive reaction she ran away.</p><br/><p>Fu fun, what a splendid skill I have.</p><br/><p>And now if I just get the information from this man.</p><br/><p>We can begin the capture of this base\u2019s evil-ja na!</p><br/><p>Fufufu, this is going pretty well-na no ja!</p><br/><p>\u2014-</p><br/><p>Translator note:</p><br/><p>10 bucks that \u2018man\u2019 is a trap!</p><br/><p>And the big breasted woman was her sister! My years of anime tell me this!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

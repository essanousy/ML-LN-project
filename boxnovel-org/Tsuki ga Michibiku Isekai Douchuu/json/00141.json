The other one was already dead and in no state for treatment\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>[Got it. Please return to the students\u2019 side]</p><br/><p>\u201cAs you will\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>Finishing his report to me, Shiki greets the Limia King and heads to where the students are.</p><br/><p>[We were unable to save one of the knights. I\u2019m truly sorry. Also, no words are enough to apology for the result of Ilumgand-sama]</p><br/><p>He was able to save one huh.</p><br/><p>I have to thank Shiki for that.</p><br/><p>\u201cRaidou, there\u2019s no need for you to mind it. Just remembering those wounds, I am happy that at least one has been saved. Let me thank you once again for saving the life of the knight and the prince. You defeating that monster was also splendid\u201d (King)</p><br/><p>Prince.</p><br/><p>Ah\u2026</p><br/><p>I suddenly recall that sensation in my hands.</p><br/><p>I feel like that will definitely turn into something troublesome later.</p><br/><p>For now, I should be grateful that the topic is not touched yet.</p><br/><p>In the first place, the breasts of the prince were nowhere to be found.</p><br/><p>But for my hand to accidentally end up in that kind of place after her sarashi or something similar to hide her chest was torn, what kind of accident is that?</p><br/><p>[Those words are wasted on me]</p><br/><p>\u201cYour students were also great. Even if it was with a group of seven, they were able to defeat an opponent that our imperial knights couldn\u2019t. It is to the point that I want to bring all of them back to my country. Of course, also you who the defeated the same type of monster\u201d (King)</p><br/><p>His gaze is going back and forth between me and the short katana.</p><br/><p>How to call it, it was like the eyes of an influential person.</p><br/><p>Also \u2018the same type\u2019 huh.</p><br/><p>I wonder about that. Ilumgand felt a few steps stronger and troublesome.</p><br/><p>As I thought, maybe he was special?</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know what activities Rona did in this town, so I don\u2019t know the background either.</p><br/><p>[Sorry to say this, but the variant I fought was a lot weaker than the one my students were fighting. So please acknowledge them instead of me. I think it was a harsh experience for them, but they fought well. Also, each one of them may have some thoughts about their future, but receiving the praise of the Limia King will definitely encourage them]</p><br/><p>\u201cUmu. But, weaker huh. I was unable to tell but, is that true? In that case, there\u2019s the chance that the work towards Ilumgand was more through\u201d</p><br/><p>The Limia King looks like he is thinking.</p><br/><p>This is Rotsgard, but that assaulter \u2013 and victim at the same time \u2013 is Ilumgand, the son of a noble in Limia.</p><br/><p>Also, the school festival that is occurring in this town gathers people from around the world.</p><br/><p>If they want to narrow the suspects, there would be way too many candidates and would have a hard time with it.</p><br/><p>The demon race would be the biggest suspect, but there\u2019s quite a lot going on between hyumans as well.</p><br/><p>Anyways, Jin and the others have received a godsend.</p><br/><p>To receive words that are practically an unofficial offer from the literal top of one of the four major powers.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s the fact about national power, but there\u2019s also the climate and geography that\u2019s comparable to the Empire, and can expect much from Limia in the future. If someone asked me in which of the four major powers I would like to live, Limia would be the one I would most likely choose.</p><br/><p>If I choose an area where the nobles are better, I think that it would be easier to live.</p><br/><p>Those kids would be happy if they heard this.</p><br/><p>From an academy scholarship student into a knight corps or a magician corps in Limia Kingdom is a straight path to success.</p><br/><p>Maybe everyone except the Rembrandt sisters will go.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The Hopelace Head was on his knees, looking at the lump of meat.</p><br/><p>Even if it was his second son, it is still the remains of his son.</p><br/><p>He most likely lost his strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cRaidou-dono, I have something to talk with you about later. I don\u2019t mind if it\u2019s after this turmoil has calmed down, so please make some time\u201d (Joshua)</p><br/><p>[Understood, Prince Joshua]</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t plan on telling anyone about that previous shock.</p><br/><p>But the problem would be, how am I going to make her understand that?</p><br/><p>Well then\u2026</p><br/><p>We have already secured this place, so let\u2019s contact Tomoe and bring this people to the safe place where the other guests are.</p><br/><p>And then, have the remaining spectators evacuate.</p><br/><p>For now there have been no emergency calls from anyone, so I want to confirm the situation once.</p><br/><p>I was prepared to receive several problematic reports from the Mist Lizards, but there wasn\u2019t a single one.</p><br/><p>As expected of Rembrandt-san.</p><br/><p>He must have explained it well.</p><br/><p>Well it would have been easier to explain if I called something more hyuman-like for example: Gorgons, Arkes, or the safest choice Forest Onis.</p><br/><p>As long as I show it to Rembrandt-san, it would be a matter of time before his daughters also learn about their existence.</p><br/><p>It would be troublesome to explain every single thing, so leaving it as if I can only summon the Blue Lizard race is easier for me.</p><br/><p>[Even if we stay here, there might be an attack again. Please take refuge in the same safe place as the guests. The matter related to your country has already been resolved]</p><br/><p>\u201cBut to stay in a safe place like that, do you think I would be able to face the residents of this town?\u201d (King)</p><br/><p>[The chief of this town, the Academy Principal, is also there. Of course, he is most likely moving in order to protect this town. Staying in a safe place to make more precise orders should help in calming down this turmoil faster. We will endeavor in evacuating the residents. I am not used to this kind of situations, but I will do my best]</p><br/><p>\u201cEvacuate? With power like yours, shouldn\u2019t you be going for suppressing?\u201d (King)</p><br/><p>[Of course, if there\u2019s the need to, I will. Just that, since the academy force is concentrating on suppressing like what happened a while ago, I thought that we should take on the job of guiding the evacuation and aiding which is lacking in personnel]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Similar\u2026 to the just descended\u2026\u201d (King)</p><br/><p>In a low voice, the king mutters something.</p><br/><p>Damn it, I missed what he said.</p><br/><p>I think he said something about resembling.</p><br/><p>Was that a monologue? Well, might as well confirm.</p><br/><p>[Sorry, can you please repeat?]</p><br/><p>\u201cAh no, there\u2019s no need to mind it. I see. Then if we stay here fretting, it would only cause trouble huh. Umu\u2026 Joshua\u201d (King)</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t tell me.</p><br/><p>But he didn\u2019t reject my idea of prioritizing evacuation.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d (Joshua)</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if it will make it in time, but have an available unit head to Rotsgard. Reinforcements are definitely needed. I don\u2019t mind if it\u2019s after taking shelter, so please contact them. I will talk with the Academy Principal regarding the permission of it. You pass a thought transmission to a relay point and have them hurry the report to the Kingdom\u201d (King)</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood. Well, the closest unit is the unit of the Hopelace household that has a territory in the Kingdom\u2019s southern tip. When we secure a safe place where I can do thought transmission, I will transmit it immediately\u201d (Joshua)</p><br/><p>Joshua glances, but the Hopelace household head doesn\u2019t react.</p><br/><p>Is he alright?</p><br/><p>He lost his son, so I wonder if he can do any normal decisions currently.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, Raidou. It might be troublesome, but please teleport us. After that, can you please lend a shoulder to that absentminded one over there?\u201d (King)</p><br/><p>[I would be happy to]</p><br/><p>I confirm the location with Tomoe, and make mist that connects to the place she is in.</p><br/><p>Thick mist that one can\u2019t see through appeared in front of the king.</p><br/><p>I glance at Shiki and Mio.</p><br/><p>Looks like they are doing the follow-up of the students.</p><br/><p>I thought they could be taken as a fighting force in a matter of this degree, but it is probably no good.</p><br/><p>They probably still have in mind that those monsters were former hyumans. The weakening in their strength is heavy.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know how the evacuation of the other students is going, but I feel like it would be better to send these kids to an evacuation point and have them quietly wait there.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no assurance that there will only be one opponent, and there\u2019s also my promise with Rembrandt-san.</p><br/><p>It wouldn\u2019t be good to push them.</p><br/><p>While feeling disappointed, I look at the unit that has purple clothing and blood mixed.</p><br/><p>Is this the level of the corps that are working as a mainline defense against the variants?</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know their real strength and their numbers, but depending on the number of people that can actually fight decently, this matter will probably take several days.</p><br/><p>While thinking in my own way about how this situation would develop, I see off the back of the staggering knight.</p><br/><p>While at it, I confirm that the Limia King and Prince Joshua disappear into the mist.</p><br/><p>Well then.</p><br/><p>I take the arm of the Head-dono that is grabbing the rails, motionlessly looking at the lump of meat.</p><br/><p>[Hopelace-sama, excuse me. I will see you off, so please depart]</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment I take his arm and try to make him stand, he brushes off my hand and yells.</p><br/><p>It was quite the high volume, and the eyes of the students and my followers turn to where we are.</p><br/><p>Waving my hand to convey that it\u2019s nothing, I wait for the Head-dono to stand by himself.</p><br/><p>This may be something that can\u2019t be helped. He glares at me hatefully and without the need of lending him a shoulder, he staggers to where the mist is and disappears inside it.</p><br/><p>Well, not like I was planning on having everyone feel indebted to me though.</p><br/><p>Hah\u2026</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t even look at Amelia once, and yet, why am I the one getting so much hate?</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t understand.</p><br/><p>Did he inherit the hate his son had?</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t even know the reason of his son\u2019s hate either, so I am still here with a question mark.</p><br/><p>I really don\u2019t understand the nobles.</p><br/><p>I suddenly remember the words of Prince Joshua.</p><br/><p>A rampaging beast that one can\u2019t feel any trace of personality in it, huh.</p><br/><p>The last shout of Ilumgand that was mixed with the thunderous sound of the explosion.</p><br/><p>\u2018I just wanted to apologize\u2019</p><br/><p>Is what he said.</p><br/><p>\u2026 This is probably something that will never be realized now.</p><br/><p>In the many times that I heard the voice of that variant, I didn\u2019t expect to actually understand something he said, but well, since I ended up hearing it, it can\u2019t be helped.</p><br/><p>If there was someone you wanted to apologize to so much that you shouted it at your last moments\u2026.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t waste your time pestering me and just do thought transmission or write a letter to tell that person how you felt.</p><br/><p>I sympathized with him for a moment, but after seeing off the Head-dono, I see Mio leaving the stage and running towards me, so I change the gears in my emotions.</p><br/><p>No matter what he wanted to say or who it was to, I won\u2019t know.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no point in worrying about it now.</p><br/><p>\u201cWaka-sama, did anything serious happen to you?!\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>I nod once and answer Mio.</p><br/><p>Right now Tomoe should be guiding the Limia group.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s Root there as well, and the distinguished people have their own point of view, so being there is better for their job.</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m fine. In your side, it seems like\u2026 it has turned into something complicated]</p><br/><p>In a sense, it is to be expected.</p><br/><p>The atmosphere around the students isn\u2019t only of the victory in that battle, a complicated atmosphere.</p><br/><p>Especially Amelia, her exhaustion is terrible.</p><br/><p>Looks like she also got injured.</p><br/><p>Her shoulder huh.</p><br/><p>Even if Shiki treated her, he can\u2019t regenerate the clothes and armor, so the place she was injured is easy to tell.</p><br/><p>Anyways, even if she has her own circumstances, as long as she doesn\u2019t tell me about it, it means that I am not qualified to hear it.</p><br/><p>Her loving Shiki is with her, so I will just leave it to him.</p><br/><p>If Shiki hears about her circumstances and he finds it necessary to tell me, he will.</p><br/><p>There doesn\u2019t seem to be anything I can do regarding her.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was close. At the end, when he howled and the vanguard was unable to move, I thought that there was no choice but to lend them a hand, but Amelia somehow did it. To endow a completed spell to an arrow, counting Sif, those two really did something reckless-desu wa. It was probably an imitation of Shiki though\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>[Endowing a spell huh. And that\u2019s what caused the explosion. It was pretty amazing]</p><br/><p>An imitation of Shiki huh.</p><br/><p>Endowing a completed spell to a weapon, it increases the attack power explosively.</p><br/><p>Just that, the effective time is really short.</p><br/><p>Shiki said that he can only maintain it for several minutes.</p><br/><p>Bluntly speaking, the consumption rate is bad.</p><br/><p>As long as you are not that concerned about the attack power of your weapon, there isn\u2019t much point in using it.</p><br/><p>Even with Shiki, he said that he mostly used this only when he wanted his opponent to mistake it for endowing magic and create an opening out of it.</p><br/><p>It seems the two of them were able to do it, but if it\u2019s them, they would only be able to maintain it for a few seconds.</p><br/><p>I see, that\u2019s reckless.</p><br/><p>With an opponent like the variant that has high defensive power against magic itself and has a limited amount of elements that are effective against it, this technique barely enters the degree of being useful.</p><br/><p>With arrows, there\u2019s the merit that the power won\u2019t decrease even if it distances from you, but if the effective time ends before it reaches the target, it would be completely useless, so the demerits are big.</p><br/><p>I approach the vanguard group that is sitting.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Sensei\u201d</p><br/><p>[Jin, you did well]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 I was supposed to not care about what happened to him. Actually, I should have been pissed off. But when I thought that I would be killing him\u2026 I just\u2026\u201d (Jin)</p><br/><p>It looks like he is confused.</p><br/><p>The point is, he thought he would be able to but he couldn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>And he is unable to accept it.</p><br/><p>\u2018Even though I defeat mamonos without mercy\u2019, is probably something they all hold in their minds.</p><br/><p>[He was a hyuman in the beginning. It\u2019s not something strange. Don\u2019t push yourself and rest for now]</p><br/><p>\u201c?!! Are you saying we will only be in the way?!\u201d</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s not it. You guys are students. There\u2019s no need for students to fight in the frontlines. Fighting is the job of others]</p><br/><p>Honestly, there\u2019s a part of me that actually thought they would get in the way. But there\u2019s no need to say that and hurt them, so I told them my main reason.</p><br/><p>Leaving aside if they are dependable or not, the Academy Town has their fighting force as well.</p><br/><p>People like the purple clothed guys.</p><br/><p>Information will be steadily gathered, so beginning with the Academy Principal, the influential people of the Academy will most likely plan out counter measures for the variants.</p><br/><p>At the least, the situation is definitely not to the point that there\u2019s the need for the enrolled students to step into the frontlines.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut we can also fight plenty enough!!\u201d (Jin)</p><br/><p>[For someone that fought only once and is already this tired, quite the big words there. Also, even if she was healed, Amelia received quite the injury you know?]</p><br/><p>If the second variant intruded in that fight, there\u2019s the possibility that deaths would appear.</p><br/><p>Well, the fact that they haven\u2019t touched the topic of that second variant even once might be because they didn\u2019t even notice it.</p><br/><p>If that\u2019s the case, I can say for sure that what they need right now is not battle experience but rest.</p><br/><p>They don\u2019t have the freedom to fight several variants at once.</p><br/><p>Even if I said it was weaker than Ilumgand, depending on the power of the opponent, there\u2019s the chance they might die.</p><br/><p>It doesn\u2019t change the fact that they were former hyumans, so there\u2019s the chance they will waver again.</p><br/><p>My uneasiness in counting them as fighting force is big.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh\u2026 that is\u2026\u201d (Jin)</p><br/><p>[I wanted to restore him]</p><br/><p>\u201c?!!\u201d</p><br/><p>[That was your true intention, right?]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t for Sensei? Am I\u2026 na\u00efve?\u201d (Jin)</p><br/><p>The frail words that Jin said were an affirmation that, till the very end, he didn\u2019t choose to kill him.</p><br/><p>[I felt that instead of having you guys die, it would be better to bring down Ilumgand. For me, you guys are more important than him, and Amelia probably felt the same way when she took action. If you lament your naivety, it is okay to just improve yourself in your remaining time at the academy. I think that this trait of yours is a strong point and also an important part of you]</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t work in his favor in this occasion though.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s true that it is one of his biggest appeals.</p><br/><p>The composed disposition and the coldhearted trait don\u2019t fit him at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was a naivety that brought everyone into danger. To call it a strong point is just\u2026\u201d (Jin)</p><br/><p>Oh? An unusual display of heavy weakness from him.</p><br/><p>Even though it is fine to just leave the complicated thinking and concentrate on resting.</p><br/><p>[It is fine to just think about that later. Right now you should rest. This is an order as a teacher. I have received information that variants have appeared in this town and in the towns around. This matter will probably take time]</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way\u2026 what in the world is going on?\u201d (Jin)</p><br/><p>[Anyways, today you guys should take refuge in the place where the other students are and rest. Even if you want to fight, if your body doesn\u2019t follow, there\u2019s no point. Also\u2026]</p><br/><p>[Sif and Yuno]</p><br/><p>I call the Rembrandt sisters that are together.</p><br/><p>\u201cRaidou-sensei\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSensei\u201d</p><br/><p>[Your parents are okay. I have placed dependable bodyguards with them, so there\u2019s no need to worry. You will obediently evacuate right?]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Understood\u201d (Sif)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I will evacuate, for today\u201d (Yuno)</p><br/><p>Yuno is also a troublesome lady.</p><br/><p>Is she saying that she intends to fight?</p><br/><p>Sif also responded as if she was harboring something as well.</p><br/><p>I told this to Jin too but, you guys are students so there\u2019s no need to get so eager.</p><br/><p>Even though other parts of their body are clearly showing exhaustion, their eyes were strangely vivid.</p><br/><p>Is the battle excitement state still continuing?</p><br/><p>No matter which, the best choice seems to be rest.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s leave the thankful words of the Limia King for a later time.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s also the issue with the Prince as well.</p><br/><p>It would be troublesome if she gets rash and does something reckless.</p><br/><p>Especially when the person she wants to protect is being targeted.</p><br/><p>I was able to experience this just a few moments ago.</p><br/><p>[Shiki, Mio. Please guide the students to the evacuation point. If there\u2019s the need to, it is okay to put that place as the guarding priority]</p><br/><p>\u201cEeh?! Uhm, and Waka-sama?\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>[I will go hear the situation from Tomoe. I leave these kids in your care]</p><br/><p>I make mist that connects to the same place as before.</p><br/><p>Tomoe, just how long does she intend to watch and wait?</p><br/><p>It would be troublesome if the guests were to catch me, so I will just quietly go there, quickly hear what she has to say, and then head to my store to see how it is going.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I\u2019m honored to have been called here today.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll try conducting myself like I\u2019m a lower-class person.</p><br/><p>Incidentally, the prince\u2019s appearance is as it always has been until now; she is dressed in men\u2019s formal clothes.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m not taken by surprise by her wearing a dress or anything like that.</p><br/><p>\u300cI heard that you are now able to speak; it seems that you have become completely fluent in conversation. I, too, am thankful that you accepted my request to meet, Raidou-dono.\u300d(Joshua)</p><br/><p>The prince is speaking in her usual polite tone.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m a little of tired of having my speech mentioned every time I meet someone.</p><br/><p>\u300cSo, what did you need of me?\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>As according to my plan, I\u2019ll give her an apology and have her forgive me for my rudeness the other day.</p><br/><p>I'm not entirely sure how to address royalty in a polite manner, so I\u2019ve accepted that I\u2019ll be impertinent many times today as I listen to what she has to say.</p><br/><p>... I\u2019m also busy these days, so I kind of want to finish this quickly.</p><br/><p>\u300c... Well. Let us get straight to the issue at hand.\u300d(Joshua)</p><br/><p>\u300cPlease.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cFirstly, the thing you found out about me the other day, that...\u300d(Joshua)</p><br/><p>Joshua looks like she\u2019s having a hard time saying it.</p><br/><p>She\u2019s talking about that, isn\u2019t she.</p><br/><p>\u300cThe fact that you\u2019re a woman?\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300c... Yes. I\u2019m sure you would know this by seeing my appearance, but this fact is known only to a few in Limia Kingdom. It has not been leaked at all to other countries, or at least, that should be the case.\u300d(Joshua)</p><br/><p>That should be the case, huh.</p><br/><p>Regarding the demons and the empire, does she feel there\u2019s a possibility that it has been leaked?</p><br/><p>Ah, I wonder if there\u2019s a chance that the room is bugged.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Joshua-sama is talking about quite a serious matter here, it\u2019s probably fine.</p><br/><p>We\u2019re not discussing anything that would be bad for me, so there\u2019s no need for me to worry anyway.</p><br/><p>\u300cI see.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cOf course, I understand that it was just an accident while you were trying to save me. However, regarding this subject... I would like to request that you do not mention this to anyone.\u300d(Joshua)</p><br/><p>Request.</p><br/><p>Zara-san said it sarcastically, but considering our positions, this request is more like an order.</p><br/><p>At the very least, it feels that way.</p><br/><p>Well, this person might be from the kingdom of Limia, but she did seem to support the Kuzunoha company.</p><br/><p>Even I know whether or not it\u2019s wise to disclose the prince\u2019s real gender.</p><br/><p>\u300cI understand.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300c... Huh?\u300d(Joshua)</p><br/><p>\u300cEh, err. I understand. I will not tell anyone.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cUmm. But you know my secret.\u300d(Joshua)</p><br/><p>She looks like she wants to ask me if I\u2019m not going to make a demand in exchange.</p><br/><p>Her expression has been slowly stiffening since we began our meeting, but now in a single instant, it\u2019s relaxed completely.</p><br/><p>\u300cI will not tell anyone.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll say it to her clearly.</p><br/><p>More like, listen properly.</p><br/><p>What else would I do when knowing the secret of a large country\u2019s prince?</p><br/><p>Threaten her, for example?</p><br/><p>That would definitely be troublesome.</p><br/><p>Have her be on good terms with me?</p><br/><p>Even though our social position isn\u2019t equal and I\u2019m the only one who knows the other\u2019s secret?</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t picture her being my friend.</p><br/><p>Also... Limia is the country where Hibiki-senpai lives.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t want to have a dispute with the prince of such a place.</p><br/><p>\u300c... I\u2019m sorry, but I cannot trust you.\u300d(Joshua)</p><br/><p>\u300cEven if you say that \u2013\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cIs there nothing that you wish for? If it is within my power, I will make an effort to grant it.\u300d(Joshua)</p><br/><p>She\u2019s thinking that nothing is as costly as a free gift, huh.</p><br/><p>\u300cCurrently, there\u2019s nothing in particular. Though I think it might be best for you to return to your country with haste and devote your power to its restoration.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300c... I am speechless. Indeed, that is one thing that I should do.\u300d(Joshua)</p><br/><p>In the first place, it\u2019s odd that the prince is still in Rotsgard even though the king has already returned.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, please do so.\u300d(Mokoto)</p><br/><p>In fact, I can see her face occasionally looking like she wants to go back.</p><br/><p>\u300cAt the same time, investigating you and negotiating with you are also things that I should be doing.\u300d(Joshua)</p><br/><p>Joshua-sama puts on a troubled smile.</p><br/><p>Perhaps it\u2019s because it\u2019s to do with the first topic that we discussed in the meeting.</p><br/><p>However, I don\u2019t have any intention of making a deal or submitting to any demands. Since Rotsgard is in this state and Asora is in commotion as well.</p><br/><p>\u300cI would be relieved if you would report that there are no problems at this moment in time. I\u2019m currently busy with the restoration of Rotsgard. You would know this if you did some investigating, but we don\u2019t have any thoughts to offer our cooperation to any single country in particular.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300c... It does seem that way. Other countries seem to be thinking of ways to bring you over to their side, although they are not showing any results.\u300d(Joshua)</p><br/><p>\u300cYes. And I would think that they should not expect any results from now on, either.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>Most likely, because we won\u2019t become attached to any particular country.</p><br/><p>In fact, it\u2019s unlikely that we\u2019re going to be allied with only the hyumans.</p><br/><p>... Though I can\u2019t say that.</p><br/><p>\u300c... When I tell you to report to me, exactly as you said, this is what happens. Hmm...\u300d(Joshua)</p><br/><p>TLN: This one is really tough to translate, basically Joshua is displeased that Makoto rejected her negotiation in the previous dialogue line</p><br/><p>\u300cI have no intention of threatening you. Definitely not with me wanting something as the reason. I just made the suggestion because I thought that in your position, you should be returning to your country as soon as possible rather than concerning yourself with me, your highness.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>If I\u2019m the only concern, then she could probably just return.</p><br/><p>\u300cI see, then I shall accept your suggestion. It seems that I gave you a meaningless warning in our discussion.\u300d(Joshua)</p><br/><p>\u300cBetween the academy, the merchants\u2019 guild, Falz-dono of the adventurers\u2019 guild and the visitors from the temple, we don\u2019t have the time to pursue additional endeavours.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300c... I have some influence within the temple. It is not much, but I will tell them to restrain themselves.\u300d(Joshua)</p><br/><p>\u300cThat would be of great help.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>It really would be.</p><br/><p>The fact that no actual work gets done just by talking causes a lot of stress for me.</p><br/><p>\u300cI am sorry for taking your time when you are so busy. I do not have any more... No, Raidou-dono. Could I ask you one more thing?\u300d(Joshua)</p><br/><p>\u300cPlease.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat do you think of me?\u300d(Joshua)</p><br/><p>Oi, isn\u2019t that quite an ambiguous question?</p><br/><p>What I do I think of her?</p><br/><p>About the fact that she\u2019s pretending to be a man?</p><br/><p>Or is she asking about my impression of her as a woman?</p><br/><p>The fact that she\u2019s stayed here to discuss these things with me instead of returning to her country?</p><br/><p>It\u2019s hard to decide which of these possibilities I should answer.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat do I think? I am not sure if this will be an answer to your question, but I think that you are having a hard time.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cA hard time?\u300d(Joshua)</p><br/><p>\u300cYes. The fact that you are putting on that appearance, the fact that you are royalty, the fact that you\u2019re having to have these conversations with a strange youngster like myself. I feel that you are standing in a difficult position.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300c... Fufu, excuse me. Position, you say? It seems that you have quite a strange way of thinking.\u300d(Joshua)</p><br/><p>I wonder if I gave an unexpected answer.</p><br/><p>Those are my honest feelings, though.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, I will excuse myself, your highness.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>Just in case, I address her as \u201cyour highness\u201d so as not to continue treading on the fact that she is a woman.</p><br/><p>I lower my head to Joshua-sama and bid her farewell.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u300cOh my, if it isn\u2019t Raidou-dono. It has been a while since we\u2019ve met like this, hasn\u2019t it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c... Falz-dono. I have been busy.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>I finished my discussion with Joshua-sama and met with several lecturers afterwards.</p><br/><p>As I was walking through the corridors to leave the academy, I ran into Root.</p><br/><p>As Root said, it\u2019s rare to see him in the academy.</p><br/><p>I haven\u2019t seen him in a while, either.</p><br/><p>... Now that I think about it, I let him borrow something, didn\u2019t I?</p><br/><p>Though I intend to have him return it when the adventurers\u2019 guild acknowledges the existence of Kaleneon.</p><br/><p>\u300cCan I have just a little of your time?\u300d(Root)</p><br/><p>\u300cIf it is only a little.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s good. Well then, over there is a steeple that nobody visits at this time of day, so let\u2019s head there.\u300d(Root)</p><br/><p>\u300cAlright.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>Following Root\u2019s lead, I arrive at the empty steeple on the upper floors.</p><br/><p>Wow.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s quite a good view.</p><br/><p>I can get an uninterrupted view of the half-destroyed city from here.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m sorry about this incident. I didn\u2019t think that the adventurer Sofia would stand in your way there. Even though I could not anticipate the goddess\u2019s interference, I feel guilty towards you and the others, Makoto-kun.\u300d(Root)</p><br/><p>\u300cYou watched me through Sofia\u2019s eyes and you feel guilty?\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>It\u2019s amazing that he can say that.</p><br/><p>Part of the reason I followed him to this deserted place without thinking is because he feels indebted to me.</p><br/><p>Another part of me is also thinking that if he treats this and that as separate matters, I could throw him out.</p><br/><p>Virtues are important.</p><br/><p>\u300cAhahaha... Actually, I made it so that I can use high-level adventurers as something of a safety net \u2013\u300d(Root)</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s unusual that you\u2019re lying so obviously today, Root. The reason Sofia could do something like that is because she was a hyuman who had a close connection with dragons \u2013 no, with you, isn\u2019t that right?\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>I noticed it there, which is why I can notice it in his eyes now.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a weak lie considering it\u2019s coming from Root.</p><br/><p>\u300c... It\u2019s unusual that you\u2019re so sharp today, Makoto-kun. You noticed Sofia\u2019s secret?\u300d(Root)</p><br/><p>\u300cI don\u2019t know exactly what it was. But I know it was related to you. I just thought it was impossible for a hyuman to mutate spontaneously and gain the power of a dragon.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cI see.\u300d(Root)</p><br/><p>\u300cAnd her obsession with you was no joke... Both of them. That\u2019s why I said I just lent it to you. It seemed pretty rough on our Shiki, too.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cShe was quite a high-level dragon, but it\u2019s weird that you\u2019re criticizing me with such a rich tone, even if I did make an agreement with you. I did teach Shiki-kun various things, but I didn\u2019t think that he would be able to destroy Lancer.\u300d(Root)</p><br/><p>Shiki himself mentioned that he barely made it through that.</p><br/><p>For his sake, let\u2019s not tell Root that.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ll pass that on to Shiki.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cPlease do. In any case, I\u2019m grateful that you took care of both of them.\u300d(Root)</p><br/><p>Hey hey, are you planning to keep playing dumb after all that, Root?</p><br/><p>\u300c... Look here. You\u2019re not finished, are you?\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300c... Eh?\u300d(Root)</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat I\u2019m saying is, I \u201chanded over\u201d management to you, but I only meant that I would lend it to you.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300c!\u300d(Root)</p><br/><p>\u300cTomorrow, no, maybe as early as tonight, right? Jeez, there\u2019s something wrong with you today, you know? You\u2019ve been having all your tricks seen through easily by someone like me.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cMakoto...kun. You are...\u300d(Root)</p><br/><p>\u300cOnce we\u2019re done cleaning up, I\u2019m going over there to ask for my reward for all of this. Get a hold of yourself, chief-dono of the adventurers\u2019 guild.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300c...\u300d(Root)</p><br/><p>With no trace of his usual joking attitude, he simply returns my gaze.</p><br/><p>How do I put this. Is this guy underestimating me that much?</p><br/><p>I\u2019m extremely surprised.</p><br/><p>Sofia, and I guess in this case, Lancer and the other high-level dragons as well.</p><br/><p>I entrusted all of their ends to Root.</p><br/><p>That is what I let him borrow.</p><br/><p>Tomoe was a little concerned, but I don\u2019t intend to ask for all the details.</p><br/><p>After tomorrow, I\u2019ll just go to Root to have him take care of Kaleneon.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m fine with that.</p><br/><p>\u300cPeople mature in the blink of an eye... That has really been the case for you, hasn\u2019t it...\u300d(Root)</p><br/><p>\u300cThanks for the compliment. Well then, I\u2019m going back to work. I need to show my face in the office as well; I\u2019ve got more work than I can handle right now.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>Leaving the astonished Root behind, I leave the steeple.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

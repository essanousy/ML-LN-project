Well then, over here.\u201d</p><br/><p>I am already feeling terrible though.</p><br/><p>As expected, even I am questioning all this.</p><br/><p>Azu-san was walking to the front of us carefreely as if he were a tourist guide.</p><br/><p>This is the other side of the balloon torsion. In other words, the world of the dead.</p><br/><p>Something shining faint red was drifting in the atmosphere.</p><br/><p>Or maybe not? Is the air itself changing colors?</p><br/><p>Is this air that can be inhaled?</p><br/><p>From what I remember him saying, I should be fine as long as I have the Magic Armor deployed, but\u2026well, I can\u2019t feel relaxed.</p><br/><p>I feel as if we are walking at dusk in a place where sound has died out.</p><br/><p>For some strange reason, there\u2019s no sound of footsteps either.</p><br/><p>The sensation at my feet is soft like that of sponge, a soft sandy beach; there\u2019s no other words I can find that can describe this accurately.</p><br/><p>From here, the landscape before Azu-san who is at the front is changing constantly.</p><br/><p>At times, he stops and continues walking again, and at those times, when he does a step forward, the surrounding landscape changes completely.</p><br/><p>A stone paved path, a forest, sand dunes, lake surface, deep inside a jungle, and also a townscape that felt familiar\u2026and at times, there\u2019s even the ironic cemetery. Even though the feeling at my feet was not changing at all, the scenery in front of us was changing constantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is no illusion, but this is not real either. World of the dead huh. What a strange place.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Looks like Tomoe is still fine.</p><br/><p>Just in case, I have strengthened her into her silver haired mode.</p><br/><p>Even so, I have no assurance that allows me to feel relaxed. That applies to me as well.</p><br/><p>The impressions she is voicing out are not that different from the ones I have.</p><br/><p>But, as expected of a person that uses illusions, it seems she also suspected that the abnormality in our surroundings could have been the work of an illusion or something related to it.</p><br/><p>I see, an illusion huh.</p><br/><p>It is true that this view is somewhat similar.</p><br/><p>I have only experienced this a number of times in the past though. It reminds me of the feeling I get when I experience the ability of Tomoe.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s similar points with what\u2019s happening right now and the experiences inside my head.</p><br/><p>Even if this is not an illusion, it might be related to the past memory of a lifeform.</p><br/><p>\u201cCalling them inhabitants would be weird but, aren\u2019t there any dead people here? I don\u2019t see anything of the sort here though.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I try asking what was bothering me.</p><br/><p>It seems this is not the first time here for Azu-san, so it should be worth a try.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Fumu, if you are imagining something like undeads, there\u2019s nothing like that here.\u201d (Aznoval)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It is true that I was imagining things like skeletons or zombies; in other words, things that were related to bones and dead bodies.</p><br/><p>So there\u2019s none here?</p><br/><p>Now that I think about it, undeads are dead people, but maybe they are the figures of the people that didn\u2019t want to come here and stayed in the world of the living.</p><br/><p>Or maybe they had grudges or lingering feelings that bound them to the world of the living?</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>It may not always the that way in Buddhism, but in Shinto, I feel like there\u2019s a tendency of judging them as impurities.</p><br/><p>Or more like, practically everything was like that.</p><br/><p>In that case, my way of thinking of the world of dead might be closer to that of Shinto.</p><br/><p>\u201cApparently, they are going around in the form of souls. I don\u2019t really have much perception abilities of that type, and I am not the type that has high sensitivity to those things, but there\u2019s souls existing here and there, so it seems people that have perception abilities normally die here.\u201d (Aznoval)</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh~.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>The situation is overwhelming me right now, lessening the amount of words I let out.</p><br/><p>I try to deploy the [Sakai] I normally use to search for living things in the other side.</p><br/><p>At that instant, everything I could see in the area was filled with reactions.</p><br/><p>I see. It doesn\u2019t work at all.</p><br/><p>I have to adjust it to one that can be used in this world. I wonder if it is possible.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems the landscape here is also because of the ubiquity of the souls or something like that. If you have interest in the details of the area around here, Futsu who is waiting at our destination can tell you about it, but\u2026if you can\u2019t understand the world travelling explanation of Root, you won\u2019t be able to understand this one either, you know? By the way, it was impossible for me.\u201d (Aznoval)</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, it would be impossible for me too.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you felt dozy at the middle of it until it ended huh. From what I remember, there\u2019s only one time I have been able to hear that explanation of hers until the end and the questioning time also lasted for several hours. There\u2019s no need to feel ashamed about it. It was a pleasant experience after all.\u201d (Aznoval)</p><br/><p>Azu-san laughs heartily.</p><br/><p>This lively laugh of his didn\u2019t fit this place at all.</p><br/><p>Or more like, pleasant experience?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRoot has spoke of this to most of the Wise she has met, has made joke-like conditions, and has carried them out. Could it be Root was Makoto-kun\u2019s first?\u201d (Aznoval) </p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s that explanation, we were also present and listened to it till the end. And while at it, Waka\u2026hasn\u2019t been attacked, Aznoval.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Oh, that\u2019s quite the rare case. There\u2019s only been one who has been able to listen till the end, and they had a discussion in a mysterious language, and after that, if it\u2019s from the opposite sex -and at times, even of the same sex- she would attack them and it would go all the way. Makoto-kun wasn\u2019t able to understand the explanation, moreover, wasn\u2019t attacked huh. From the atmosphere you let out, I thought you were born in the Heisei period , but maybe you were born in the Showa period ?\u201d (Aznoval)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did it turn into talk about my age?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t understand what this has to do with anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cRefusing something like that would need quite the hard personality, right? I simply thought the Showa period had more guys made of tough elements, you see. Or maybe you already have a woman set in your heart?\u201d (Aznoval)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Ah.\u201d</p><br/><p>The face of two women surfaced in my head.</p><br/><p>\u2026Eh?</p><br/><p>Without even one second passing, the figure of Tomoe and Mio were also added there.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>This is the worst.</p><br/><p>Is my way of thinking such a pushover? That\u2019s no good.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, but even if you had such a woman in your time at Japan, you are currently in a parallel world. It won\u2019t serve to inhibit your desires at all. Then\u2026aah\u2026\u201d (Aznoval)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What-ja, Aznoval? You are making a face unbefitting of a knight-ja ga.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s how it is. It is not Mio-san, so that means, you were already in that kind of relationship with Tomoe-san huh. Ah, so that\u2019s why Root noticed this and didn\u2019t try anything.\u201d (Aznoval)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I am impressed by your discerning eye. Umu, you didn\u2019t hit the mark, but it isn\u2019t far from the truth-ja na. It is true that Root couldn\u2019t do anything because of me-ja yo.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>It is far from the truth.</p><br/><p>We are not in that kind of relationship.</p><br/><p>Regarding the latter half of that, Tomoe listened till the end, so we were able to reject it ourselves, so in a sense, he is indeed correct though.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Is Ne-san a court lady? I see\u2026that is plausible. But Makoto-kun, Mio-san is lovable as well. That woman is definitely the type that would be by your side till the end no matter what happens, you know? Luckily, this world accepts polygamy, so\u2026\u201d (Aznoval)</p><br/><p>In the time I was feeling self-deprecation at the harem thoughts that were somewhere in my head, the conversation between Azu-san and Tomoe was flying at unbelievable places.</p><br/><p>Seriously, these two ride way too well in horrid topics.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce the legal wife is decided, things might turn that way unexpectedly fast. Umu, now that I think about it, we haven\u2019t had much of this kind of conversations. Looks like even a troublesome knight-dono like you can be of use to some extent.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cOya, isn\u2019t Tomoe-san the legal wife?\u201d (Aznoval)</p><br/><p>\u201cHm? I wonder. I don\u2019t really mind the order anyways.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut if you get married faster, it would make it possible to leave many more children faster, right? Giving birth to the child of the man you love; this is the privilege given to women. From the people I know, there\u2019s a Japanese man who married a dragon woman half, and many have lived happily.\u201d (Aznoval)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Children huh. The holy child of Waka\u2026 Fufufufu\u2026kukuku\u2026True. I do want it. I want it fast.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>The face of Tomoe had turned into the \u2018grinning face\u2019 she rarely shows.</p><br/><p>But this doesn\u2019t look like the face of a woman that got happy about understanding the privilege of women.</p><br/><p>The closest comparison would be that of a grandparent waiting for her grandchildren.</p><br/><p>It probably has already surpassed the level of parents.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is something natural.\u201d (Aznoval)</p><br/><p>Azu-san nods in understanding.</p><br/><p>No, don\u2019t go nodding.</p><br/><p>In the head of Tomoe, I probably have married who knows how many wifes in the future.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>What\u2019s this?</p><br/><p>Just now, I felt a strange chill running up my body.</p><br/><p>Also, I feel\u2026a strange gaze I have never felt before.</p><br/><p>It is not the gaze of someone. I feel as if I am being watched by the whole world. That shouldn\u2019t be possible, but I have no other way of describing this feeling.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was thinking of arranging everything first so left it for later, but it might have been a huge mistake. Mio and I are different from hyumans, so who knows what will happen in the future. Are you saying this was a task that we should have tackled as soon as possible?!\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are still young, moreover, it seems your company is doing well. In that case, there\u2019s no worries in terms of the assets. If you can count on the support from your surroundings, this troublesome knight proposes this foolish idea that even if you don\u2019t suddenly aim for childbirth, you should begin training for the step before that, princess Tomoe.\u201d (Aznoval)</p><br/><p>The step before that.</p><br/><p>Ah, I see. So that\u2019s what it is.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, troublesome? I was simply ignorant of your consideration. Forgive me, Aznoval. Now that I think about it, it is exactly as you were worrying about-ja. There should be women aiming for him even within the Gorgons, and his resistance towards us might make him wish for a child from Tamaki.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>H-How should I enter the conversation to change the topic?</p><br/><p>It is so deep that my countermeasures for it are right now completely blank.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like you have heard about the knowledge of Japan from Makoto-kun, so there\u2019s probably no need to say this but, in Japan, no matter how excelling or appealing of a man or woman you may be, you can only marry one person.\u201d (Aznoval)</p><br/><p>\u201cUmu, I know.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why, you may at first not care about being the second wife or lower than that. The men that have become the husbands of Root get used to harems pretty fast, but Makoto-kun is most likely different.\u201d (Aznoval)</p><br/><p>\u201cFumu fumu.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly why being the first wife is important. Depending on her, it will affect his view of a second wife.\u201d (Aznoval)</p><br/><p>\u201cI-Indeed.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom what I have seen, there\u2019s no doubt that first wife will be Tomoe-san or Mio-san. A happy married life is definitely awaiting you! In that case, when are you going to make your move? There\u2019s no need to even ask that! Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d (Aznoval)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are right! The moment is now-ja!!\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>No no, it is still only been one day since we met Azu-san for the first time\u2026</p><br/><p>Saying stuff like \u2018isn\u2019t that right?\u2019 and \u2018when are you going to make your move?\u2019, from which company did this seller come from?</p><br/><p>Also, no, the moment is not now-ja.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah yeah, I am glad to see that you understand. I want Makoto-kun to have a fulfilling Isekai life with no regrets.\u201d (Aznoval)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s totally a lie.</p><br/><p>You are currently trying to destroy my peaceful life with all you have, you know?</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way-ja ga, how many wives can a Japanese man manage to support-ja?\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026This one depends on the person. From my acquaintances, the highest number is 60, but I also know one who fell apart with 4.\u201d (Aznoval)</p><br/><p>\u201cMumuu, even when thinking about the highest number, there\u2019s the need for each one to give birth twice to even reach the hundreds. T-Then what about the age-ja? Is it possible to make children no matter the age?\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>T-Tomoe brooke!!</p><br/><p>No, she got broken!!</p><br/><p>My throat is dry.</p><br/><p>Throwing away the part about the number of wives\u2026a hundred children, she says?!</p><br/><p>Moreover, it sounds as if she is not satisfied with that many?!</p><br/><p>Is this a conversation you should be doing in the world of the dead?</p><br/><p>Or more like, this is just a joke right? Where is the \u2018you got pranked\u2019 panel?!</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, but this also depends on the person. The top age I know of is 82, but the lowest was 40, he was unable to fertilize children no matter how much he tried\u2026\u201d (Aznoval)</p><br/><p>\u201cW-What?! If we think about it from the worst case scenario, that means Waka only has 20 years left?!\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>What are you saying with such a straight face, Azu-san?</p><br/><p>The guy that was able to make children at 82 years old must have been some sort of superhuman, and the guy that couldn\u2019t make children by 40 probably had some sort of circumstances behind it!</p><br/><p>A disease, a wound, or maybe something happened in an adventure, there\u2019s also the possibility that he led an excessive sexual life and it dried him before time.</p><br/><p>I totally refuse a lifestyle like the latter one, okay?!</p><br/><p>Also, don\u2019t say things like \u2018only has 20 years left\u2019, that\u2019s incredibly improper!</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>The moment I opened my mouth because I felt like my life was seriously going to be rewritten\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAznoval, what are you joking around for? I thought you were going to be guiding them here as guests, but you have only been talking loudly about their lives. Don\u2019t you see that the souls are losing their composure and beginning to get noisy?\u201d (???)</p><br/><p>I could hear a voice reverberate in my head.</p><br/><p>It was a voice that was directed at Azu-san, but I certainly heard it as well.</p><br/><p>Tomoe must have heard it as well, but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMaking babies\u2026 what a blunder-jatta. Making babies-ja\u2026\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>She probably heard it as well, yeah.</p><br/><p>I have an idea of who that voice is.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s only one possibility after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cFutsu, it has been a while. Also, I wasn\u2019t joking at all.\u201d (Aznoval)</p><br/><p>The words of Azu-san confirm my guess.</p><br/><p>A blue hitodama in a form similar to the souls that I imagined them to be were appearing countlessly around, gathered together, and combined to make a single form.</p><br/><p>It is a dragon, but the oriental snake type of dragon.</p><br/><p>What a fresh sight.</p><br/><p>It is floating, and compared to its big body, its arms are small, and on its hands, it is holding spheres.</p><br/><p>The contours of its head are slowly becoming clearer.</p><br/><p>The horn is incredible.</p><br/><p>An extravagant horn with ramifications like that of a reindeer, and at each section, it becomes wider as it goes up.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo this is the existence that is on equal footing with Root\u2026 Futsu.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cNow I am only the manager of souls though. Nice to meet you, outstanding one, Misumi Makoto-kun.\u201d (Futsu)</p><br/><p>A pleasant voice permeates inside my head.</p><br/><p>At the place I am looking at, there\u2019s Futsu.</p><br/><p>It has taken form with its body covered in silver scales.</p><br/><p>But it wasn\u2019t as if its form was fixed to only that one.</p><br/><p>At times, Futsu would turn into a pale dragon that felt as if it were made out of ectoplasm, and at other times, it would turn even paler, transparent like wind. And there are times when it is in the middle spot of materializing and being transparent.</p><br/><p>But the form Futsu used to greet me with, the one where it materialized completely into a body where it is covered wholly in silver scales, was a mysterious view like no other.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tomoe\u2019s eyes were wide open.</p><br/><p>It was easy to tell that it was because of surprise.</p><br/><p>This type of presence is not one that can be faked.</p><br/><p>Meaning that, at the very least, it is already clear that there\u2019s actually a dragon that\u2019s comparable in strength to Superior Dragons.</p><br/><p>The appearance of a comrade that didn\u2019t exist in the vast knowledge she had of this world.</p><br/><p>It would be great if she gets into her serious mode and the conversation just now gets washed away though.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

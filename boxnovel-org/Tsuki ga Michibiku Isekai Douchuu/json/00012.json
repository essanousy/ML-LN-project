As expected of the incarnation of darkness. It means that its body is like a shadow huh.</p><br/><p>Master is clearly surprised by it and in one breath it became a defensive fight.</p><br/><p>It hasn\u2019t changed its simple-pattern attacks but it seems that because of its excitement, the body doesn\u2019t stop. Umu, it\u2019s really an instinctive beast.</p><br/><p>I wanted for him to gain as much experience as possible so I left it alone but it seems this is as far as it goes.</p><br/><p>So, should I ask you to leave this world?</p><br/><p>It happened just the moment I thought that.</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye master got crucified into a tree and got bitten by that spider.</p><br/><p>Blood. It seems I have been a spectator for too long. I am sorry master I will soon treat you\u2026??</p><br/><p>\u201cMu, this is?\u201d (Shen)</p><br/><p>It looked like master was trying to do something. Interesting. Are you telling me you still have something up your sleeve? How frightening.</p><br/><p>In the space master and the spider were, an explosion occurred.</p><br/><p>The distance between both of them opened.</p><br/><p>Being released from the claws master was already standing on his two legs.</p><br/><p>On his sides were 4 deep crimson balls. They automatically draw to their utmost and turn into arrows and launched in turns. The moment one shot through the spider another one would soon come after.</p><br/><p>The result.</p><br/><p>Without any pause the red arrows, no they were practically spears already, were piercing the spider one after the other. The fire ball that was in midair in standby and was charging energy was like that but the ones here were what?</p><br/><p>It\u2019s most likely a magic that in the middle of activating it he changed the process of its aria. He must have set a second step trigger on it.</p><br/><p>In short, as long as the user doesn\u2019t run out of maryoku he is freely able to manipulate it however he wants. In the ranks of supreme dragons there is one who does something similar to this but to see the magic of a human is a first. That fellow\u2019s magic was so complicated that just watching it made my head hurt but\u2026</p><br/><p>How was he able to make such a magic out of the elementary magic [brid]?</p><br/><p>In the memories of master there was something called game and a window appeared where you could highlight your skills. Does he possess that?</p><br/><p>When I tried to ask him to explain it to me he said: \u201cI don\u2019t have such a convenient thing given to me!\u201d and got angry.</p><br/><p>However, that thing is unbeatable. That fellow will receive damage but in the end it will swallow it and recover itself.</p><br/><p>Well, before its able to grow them again it\u2019s already pierced though.</p><br/><p>And the attacks from master also prevent him from moving from his place.</p><br/><p>But the next moment, a freezing sensation ran through all of my body. That\u2019s right, this is like the time when I slipped in the mist and had certainly captured master. Its fear.</p><br/><p>Master was preparing its bow in the middle of that attack.</p><br/><p>No, \u2018it looked like that\u2019</p><br/><p>In reality he was only moving his body as if he were carrying a bow.</p><br/><p>But in that vigor I certainly caught a glimpse of a bow with my eyes.</p><br/><p>The red attacks wouldn\u2019t stop. In other words, the magic was still in effect. I don\u2019t know if the five automatic battery became a single collective spell or he is activating them individually but the attack he is about to release was not on equal to those, I could see that it was concentrated to its utmost limits.</p><br/><p>Master extended his left hand out and in his right hand he was holding the ceremonial dagger as if it were an arrow.</p><br/><p>I could see a blue light. I could faintly see a blue mist lingering around him and it was as beautiful as an illusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo he was holding back\u201d (Shen)</p><br/><p>I was sure that he was going serious already.</p><br/><p>Right now the maryoku that was being knit and collected could not be compared to just a few moments ago. Its attribute was also different. It\u2019s most likely water. It seems to be the attribute that fits master the most.</p><br/><p>I think that maybe it is actually not that. The compatibility of master with water is simply because of his pact with me. I think he originally had another strong point and it is something that naturally shows up.</p><br/><p>I see.</p><br/><p>The current attack is not only using the maryoku inside his body but it\u2019s also using the maryoku in the surroundings. Before, he had only been using the maryoku inside of him. And even that, he has a lot.</p><br/><p>Master must have been considerate on the fights in this world and the use of the maryoku in it.</p><br/><p>It seems he has given up on that. He is planning on blowing everything up. He is being controlled by his emotions but his calm face doesn\u2019t seem to change.</p><br/><p>Then no matter the result, with this I will call it a close.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t interrupt.</p><br/><p>I will clearly watch your attack, master.</p><br/><p>It was released. The dagger that was in his hands become the core of the magic. Separating from master\u2019s hand it became a blue light and accelerated directly to the spider.</p><br/><p>That dagger wasn\u2019t just a dagger for etiquette?</p><br/><p>In the middle of the tyrannical fire, one string of blue pierced the body of the spider.</p><br/><p>And the red lights also stopped.</p><br/><p>No.</p><br/><p>The blue string in a single breath became big and swallowed everything around it. Even the whole body of the big framed spider.</p><br/><p>It was so strong it made the whole world tremble. The air and the earth trembled as if in fear.</p><br/><p>Before long the light slowly settled down.</p><br/><p>A slightly far away rock mountain had become rubbles and it had signs of a spider there.</p><br/><p>It looked as if only its shadow was remaining.</p><br/><p>Awawawawawa. This\u2026 I could only laugh at it.</p><br/><p>That kind of attack.</p><br/><p>I confirm it. The attack just now would even slaughter a dragon.</p><br/><p>Leaving aside my \u2018invincible\u2019 name, there are a number of supreme dragons that boast on their defensive capabilities.</p><br/><p>If it is an acquaintance it would be the sand wave, Zanami. But even that fellow if it received such an attack it would become a fatal wound.</p><br/><p>Master with a face that looked like it had lost all its vitality, slowly tottered to the shadow of the spider that was remaining there.</p><br/><p>Is it to retrieve his dagger?</p><br/><p>\u201cHas your stomach filled up you pervert?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>But just saying that must have taken his all because his face turned blue and he toppled over.</p><br/><p>Using that much maryoku, well it is the obvious result. His physical strength must be at his limit as well.</p><br/><p>No other choice. Let\u2019s carry him.</p><br/><p>It was the moment I thought that.</p><br/><p>\u201cWha?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The shadow become solid in a second and had revived. Impossible, it is an attack that not even a supreme dragon would be able to take you know?!</p><br/><p>Even if that spider is an incarnation of darkness it shouldn\u2019t be able to endure it!</p><br/><p>If I hurry\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t make it. The distance is too much.</p><br/><p>And without doing a single movement of preparation it jumped onto the body of master who couldn\u2019t move anymore.</p><br/><p>No good! This is what they call an error of a lifetime!</p><br/><p>This is bad this is bad this is bad!!</p><br/><p>What?</p><br/><p>That fellow\u2026 its rubbing its body on him and not trying to eat or kill him?</p><br/><p>\u201cAhaaaa~\u201d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s happy again! This is truly a pervert!</p><br/><p>\u201cDelicious~!!!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWa?\u201d (Shen)</p><br/><p>What did it say? Delicious?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe best, you are the best! My insides are filled! This is a first for me~~~!!\u201d</p><br/><p>W-What is happening?</p><br/><p>That spider is saying something. Nono, more than that, this one had reason?</p><br/><p>\u201cWonderful wonderful wonderful! So painful, so delicious, so pleasurable! This is the first time someone has shown me all this!!\u201d</p><br/><p>There is no doubt that it is its inborn nature. If it\u2019s possible I don\u2019t want to get close to it in a lifetime but I can\u2019t say that right now. I feel that instead of his life his chastity was more in danger.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am sorry to interrupt you while you are happy but, can I have a moment?\u201d (Shen)</p><br/><p>\u201cI will never let you go! I have decided to always, always be with youuuuu!</p><br/><p>Master, I\u2019m sorry. This Shen has really done an error of a lifetime. I have involved you with an unbelievable fellow-ja.</p><br/><p>I have prepared myself to accept even your stylish names.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t want to stop. Moreover, it is not hearing a single word of me.</p><br/><p>\u201cOi, pervert! Hear me!\u201d (Shen)</p><br/><p>I kick the spider off while apologizing to master.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh it hurts! Wait. What are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am sorry but you see, I want to let master rest. Long timed black spider\u201d (Shen)</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust because I have changed my form you don\u2019t recognize me. It\u2019s Shen. Supreme dragon Shen\u201d (Shen)</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know you. I haven\u2019t been able to think about anything up until now because my stomach was starving. More like, master? What kind of relationship do you have with this gentleman?\u201d</p><br/><p>The issue you are preoccupied is that. Incredible.</p><br/><p>Well I don\u2019t know the reason of why it has continued to starve to its utmost for so long.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell it was just a few days ago though. I made a pact with this man. So we are connected by the pact we have made\u2026\u201d (Shen)</p><br/><p>In the middle of my words I was left dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>Killing intent. Suddenly we turn to this huh.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuun~, so you have made a pledge huh. I see, I understand. I at least have knowledge of a pact so, then I just need to kill you and make it again right?\u201d (Yandere Spider)</p><br/><p>Its common sense is different. Even I wouldn\u2019t think that way.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, wait for a moment. In a pledge I wouldn\u2019t call him master\u201d (Shen)</p><br/><p>What a short circuited spider. It must be because it doesn\u2019t have much brain tissue. Being a relative of bugs and all. Though there have been lots of times that a spider\u2019s brain could be compared to that of a bug.</p><br/><p>Well, you know. It only uses it to hunt its prey so no matter how much it had it wouldn\u2019t be important.</p><br/><p>\u201cUaaah. Then a parent-child pact? So you are the child?\u201d (Spider)</p><br/><p>A tone of voice that tells me that it finds it unbelievable. Well that\u2019s of course. It is normal that when we make a pact with a hyuman that wouldn\u2019t happen. But master is a \u2018human\u2019 after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s ruling-ja. I am what you would call a slave. 80-20 ruling pact. That\u2019s why I have this form-ja\u201d (Shen)</p><br/><p>I show off my human body to it. For this fellow it is surely an enviable thing.</p><br/><p>After all, only when you are human-shaped can you wear a kimono and wield a katana. And in reality, my power has increased so I feel excellent. I already have no regrets of abandoning my dragon body.</p><br/><p>\u201cRuling?! You, you are supposed to be a supreme dragon right?\u201d (Spider)</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t repeat it. It hurts me a bit. More like, don\u2019t you understand? What this relationship means\u201d (Shen)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 it means, that?\u201d (Spider)</p><br/><p>With a little time it was able to understand what I was saying huh. For an idiot, no, it isn\u2019t that stupid huh.</p><br/><p>\u201cUmu, imagine being followed around by a pervert like you. Master\u2019s heart will break in a second\u201d (Shen)</p><br/><p>Well, what it is trying to do right now is not that much different though.</p><br/><p>But it is better\u2026 better\u2026 right?</p><br/><p>\u201cBut what about his agreement?\u201d (Spider)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just how it is\u201d (Shen)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are really a slave?\u201d (Spider)</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course-ja. If he so wants I would even become his attendant you know?\u201d (Shen) (TN: attendant ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0))</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I will be doing that first\u201d (Spider)</p><br/><p>\u201cI get it. But the one who will have its name given first will be me. This one I won\u2019t let you have it\u201d (Shen)</p><br/><p>Just this one I will not give in. The one who receives the name first has more seniority.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s okay right? That I, with this person\u2026\u201d (Spider)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah it\u2019s okay. Just do it already\u201d (Shen)</p><br/><p>\u201cUfufufu, thanks. Senpai~\u266b\u201d (Spider) (TN: OMG what are you going to do?!)</p><br/><p>A pact ceremony spell that I saw not that long ago was now surrounding the body of the spider and master\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>To have a contract with another one is something that has never been seen before but the pact seems to proceed without any problems.</p><br/><p>But will it really suffice with ruling? Also there is more freedom on master than when he did with me.</p><br/><p>Taking this fellows character it will go for the same rank. But, freedom? The increase in maximum capacity of maryoku normally doesn\u2019t happen though? Does that mean the spider will end up in a lower rank than me?</p><br/><p>To think that, is natural. My uneasiness doesn\u2019t disappear though. It is master after all.</p><br/><p>I check out once more the color of the pact. Red is the ruling pact. It\u2019s confirmed huh.</p><br/><p>The incarnation that has been devouring everything since ancient times, that black spider.</p><br/><p>It slowly shrinks its figure and inside the red light, I see the shape of a person.</p><br/><p>Now it was my turn to be surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will serve you for a lifetime-wa. My master-sama\u201d (Spider?)</p><br/><p>\u201cWa\u201d (Shen)</p><br/><p>My admiration didn\u2019t subside.</p><br/><p>A truly glossy gloss black hair was flowing.</p><br/><p>Her seductive and womanly figure was being shown without a single thread on her body.</p><br/><p>In accordance to the ruling pact, it became human shaped and has formed a pact with my master, Misumi Makoto.</p><br/><p>Yareyare, he really is a person that will never bore me. My master.</p><br/><p>I also wanted black hair.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014-</p><br/><p>The nightmare of all, an undying spider has now become harem member +1!!</p><br/><p>Will she continue being a nightmare or will she be the best waifu of them all?! Will Shen ever get black hair?! Will Makoto\u2019s chastity be able to survive?! Find out on the next chapter of Drago- Tsuki ga Michibiku!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

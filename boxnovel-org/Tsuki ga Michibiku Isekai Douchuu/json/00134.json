It\u2019s an interesting idea-ja\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 A Shining Wizard and a midair combo. Don\u2019t tell me Yuno is the same type as Eris\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>The team battle finals concluded.</p><br/><p>He may have shown surprising defensive power and toughness, but it didn\u2019t turn into as much of a close game as I thought, and Ilumgand sunk.</p><br/><p>In the middle of it, there was something that caught my attention, but that was also finished when I saw the midair combo.</p><br/><p>As the Hopelace\u2019s second son, he talked about authority, showed a fight that was completely different from his general notion, and without being able to show off much in the match, it finished.</p><br/><p>His relatives must have come to see him as well. How pitiful.</p><br/><p>The last spear totally hit his face too.</p><br/><p>Even if it\u2019s wooden, it was still impressive that the spear broke.</p><br/><p>Was the throw of Yuno that good, or was it the face of Ilumgand that was hard?</p><br/><p>Whichever it is, I think his consciousness was taken away with that attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe ideas of Waka\u2019s students are interesting. They are weak, but I could feel that they are used to scheming\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. The finals were pretty fun. The body techniques of that girl were great\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Tomoe and Mio seem to have enjoyed it.</p><br/><p>That they didn\u2019t show any will to evaluate the fight in the end is, well, it can\u2019t be helped.</p><br/><p>They are not hyumans to begin with, and in their perspective, they honestly feel that they are no more than chicks.</p><br/><p>But I feel a bit relieved.</p><br/><p>If they are able to think that well by themselves and look for their own style with a clear objective in mind, no matter when my class finishes, they would still be fine.</p><br/><p>Well then, I will go to the waiting room as well and congratulate them.</p><br/><p>And while it, check Hopelace\u2019s state\u2026 No, I should not do that one.</p><br/><p>It would be troublesome if I get into a problem again.</p><br/><p>I stand up and was about to move, but then, I noticed an abnormality.</p><br/><p>Jin and the others prepared their weapons. Yuno lost her spear so she made a stance with her fists.</p><br/><p>Those movements were already at the level of martial arts.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t teach her that at all, or more like, I can\u2019t teach her that, so she probably learned hand-to-hand combat from another teacher.</p><br/><p>But the referee already declared the end of the match.</p><br/><p>There should be no need for them to prepare their weapons.</p><br/><p>And in the direction they are facing, there\u2019s the fallen Ilumgand.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWaka, there\u2019s a strange magic power coming out from that brat. He is releasing an incredibly wicked aura that is coiled around emotions\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Tomoe tells me.</p><br/><p>I am not using the [Sakai] for search and examination.</p><br/><p>I am using it to suppress my power after all.</p><br/><p>Also, my perception ability without using Sakai is not impressive at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally, but it is strange-desu wa. It looks like it is not only the current emotions, old emotions are joined together as well. It feels awful-desu\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Mio is looking at Ilumgand as if looking at something weird.</p><br/><p>The released magic power was probably amplifying. It changed into the special color that appears when powerful magic power is unleashed or used.</p><br/><p>At that point, even I can clearly tell.</p><br/><p>What I am saying is that his magic power had changed to the color suitable for water magic, blue.</p><br/><p>I am not saying it defines the weakness and fortes of an individual, but it does have a big effect in the path you take.</p><br/><p>His gentle blue that\u2019s close to light blue is normally seen in people specialized in healing and support.</p><br/><p>By the way, in my case, it is a darkish deep blue. Its specialty is\u2026 Tte, this is not the time for that.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem\u2026 like he is doing this out of his will. Should we stop it?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t the people managing the tournament the ones who should do something? It does feel strange though\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>In the middle of Tomoe\u2019s words, Ilumgand stands up.</p><br/><p>Jin and the others take proper battle formation. But Amelia who is outside the stage shouts something.</p><br/><p>After that, the three dissolve their stance and go down the stage. As if following Amelia, they all simultaneously left through the exit.</p><br/><p>Ah.</p><br/><p>They went to take the weapons in the waiting room huh.</p><br/><p>That means\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWaka-sama, it seems it has turned into a slightly bad situation. Should I say, it has eaten a lot?\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>Just as I thought, Shiki speaks.</p><br/><p>\u201cJin and the others went to retrieve their weapons right?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I told them that it was a reward from Waka-sama for winning the championship. Just in case, I thought they would be able to hold it back temporarily with those so I instructed them to return\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026 noble, just what is going on with him?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is in an incredibly dangerous state. No, it can already be considered too late. He has taken a dosage of at least several months to make his body get used to this abnormality, and that time has come\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe time\u2026 has come?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>So it is really not his will.</p><br/><p>But it is surprising that it was able to escape all the diagnosis of the academy.</p><br/><p>Doping for several months?</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. That\u2019s not hyuman anymore. It is already beginning to change into a variation\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 What\u2019s a variation?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cJust as the word implies. It\u2019s when a hyuman changes into something that\u2019s not hyuman anymore. I am also a type of variation. I turned into it by my own will, so my circumstances are different from his though. There was a period of time when I was interested in the borders of hyumans and non-hyumans, and experimented with it. I presume there\u2019s no mistake\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cJust for what or who did he do this for? Hopelace is a big noble right? Is there anyone who would choose to make them their enemy? From what I hear, it seems to be quite planned out, and it feels ominous\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Waka-sama, are you really saying that? This kind of advanced magic, use of drugs, and the nature of the plan. Hyumans are the target. Seeing the situation, there\u2019s only one power that would execute this kind of plan\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? But the demon race is different right? Rona-san pulled back her troops and she said that she would cooperate for the sake of Jin and Amelia\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right.</p><br/><p>I requested Rona-san to hurriedly withdraw the demons in Rotsgard. There\u2019s no way she would do something like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, did that woman say anything about not doing anything in Rotsgard?\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. She just listened to my request, and then I promised her I would meet the demon lord later, that\u2019s all\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, even if this is the deed of that woman, she hasn\u2019t broken her promise with Waka-sama. At the very least, that\u2019s what Rona would say\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>Wouldn\u2019t that just be a play of words? Sophism?</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t want the demon race to cause any problems in the school festival.</p><br/><p>Because the matter with Hopelace suddenly came up, I asked Rona to temporarily withdraw the demons since I have scarce personnel.</p><br/><p>She accepted that.</p><br/><p>Then, that would mean she doesn\u2019t intent to cause anything here right?</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t it mean she accepted that?</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that just sophism?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was only a verbal promise after all. Even if she acts in a good willed manner, Waka-sama is still hyuman. I don\u2019t think Rona would reveal everything to you. Also, that woman saw a part of Waka-sama\u2019s power and has caught a hold of my existence. In that case, no matter what strife they cause, we would be able to get through it, that\u2019s why she didn\u2019t say it beforehand. Or maybe, if she told you and you were to do something to counter it, it might bring big disadvantages for her\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>The demon race\u2026</p><br/><p>I thought at least the demon race would be\u2026!</p><br/><p>In terms of forming a relationship or negotiating, I thought they would not be a bad option, and yet\u2026</p><br/><p>In the end, maybe the thought of expecting a genuine ally was wrong.</p><br/><p>Advantages and disadvantages, phrasing, diplomacy.</p><br/><p>It is truly filled with troublesome things.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom what I hear, the demon race is also not the type that one can deal with ordinary methods\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cEvery single one deceiving Waka-sama\u2026 They only think about themselves! How unsightly. I can\u2019t forgive them-desu wa!!\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>In truth, I didn\u2019t feel confident working along with hyumans, so I wanted to try talking with the demon race and see. But, are you trying to tell me that that thinking was na\u00efve?</p><br/><p>Or are you telling me to swallow something of this level and negotiate with the demon race?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The regret that had no place to smash into and the mortification that couldn\u2019t turn into words, were turned into breath and exhaled.</p><br/><p>Damn it.</p><br/><p>Damn it, damn it, damn it, DAMN IT!!!!</p><br/><p>I know!</p><br/><p>I have already noticed!</p><br/><p>This place is bigger than I thought.</p><br/><p>Me and the Kuzunoha Company have gathered quite a lot of attention and have begun receiving interference.</p><br/><p>This place doesn\u2019t belong to any country, so I thought it wouldn\u2019t gather that much attention, but I have understood that it was completely the opposite.</p><br/><p>Not only the four major powers, even the demon race has locked their eyes on us.</p><br/><p>Getting played around by the hyumans, Merchant Guild, demon race; not only can\u2019t I freely do business, I am beginning to lose my understanding of how to act.</p><br/><p>I stayed unaware of the wideness of the stage I am standing in for way too long.</p><br/><p>Can I do it? At this late of a time?</p><br/><p>Using Kaleneon, I would hide from all troublesome things in a place I can\u2019t be found.</p><br/><p>Even so, as long as I have talked to the Ansland sisters, there\u2019s no way I can just not do it!</p><br/><p>\u201cR-Raidou-sensei, this is terrible! There are several monsters rampaging in town!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAt the surroundings of Gotetsu, at the surrounding of Kuzunoha Company as well; everywhere has fallen into a terrible chaos! For now it doesn\u2019t seem like there is that much damage, but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The voice of Eva and Ruria.</p><br/><p>When I turned, I see that the two of them were there, out of breath.</p><br/><p>Truly good timing.</p><br/><p>For them to come talk to me when I thought about them.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s also monsters in the town huh.</p><br/><p>Because of my experience in this kind of things, my head was able to stay calm.</p><br/><p>Tomoe told me that getting ahead of myself is not good, but the summer vacation was valuable for me.</p><br/><p>I see.</p><br/><p>Ilumgand\u2019s variation. Things similar to that are probably happening in several places.</p><br/><p>Rona-san\u2026 Rona.</p><br/><p>Damn it.</p><br/><p>You\u2026 deceived me right?</p><br/><p>\u2018I didn\u2019t lie\u2019 or \u2018You didn\u2019t ask me\u2019, I don\u2019t care about any of those.</p><br/><p>If as a result, I have seen it in that way\u2026</p><br/><p>You won\u2019t have any problems if I act dishonestly as well right?</p><br/><p>It is okay to think that you guys had nothing to do with this and cope with it while having that thought in mind, right?</p><br/><p>I do think it was a one-sided trust.</p><br/><p>Even so, I can tell that the feeling of being deceived and my opposition to her are welling up.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we don\u2019t run away fast or deal with it, this place will also be dangerous sensei!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Eva-san, Ruria, calm down]</p><br/><p>\u201cBut!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt feels incredibly dangerous!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yeah. Please tell me everything you know. Also, it may be a bit fast, but I want the answer as well. I want to hear the answer from the question a few days ago]</p><br/><p>\u201c??!!\u201d</p><br/><p>I could tell that both sisters gulped their breath.</p><br/><p>It is weird that, seeing the restless state of these girls, I am steadily growing calmer.</p><br/><p>The surrounding audience that saw the abnormal state of Ilumgand, and some that maybe heard the information from outside, suddenly fall into a state of panic, and the noisiness also increased at a fast rate.</p><br/><p>The only ones calm around were us.</p><br/><p>\u2026 It thoroughly makes me hate my own naivety.</p><br/><p>I have not been through any bad things with the demon race, so they are good guys. Truly a childish thought.</p><br/><p>I am an idiot who doesn\u2019t even know the \u2018N\u2019 in negotiation.</p><br/><p>The enemy of my enemy is my ally.</p><br/><p>Even when I was in Japan, I thought: \u2018like hell that\u2019s the case\u2019, and yet, in reality I thought exactly like that.</p><br/><p>I am an idiot, truly an idiot.</p><br/><p>Even I think I am hopeless.</p><br/><p>\u2014 But\u2026</p><br/><p>Even if it is an idiot, it doesn\u2019t mean whatever they do will be forgiven.</p><br/><p>No matter how stupid that person is.</p><br/><p>No matter where I go, I won\u2019t change my thinking that: \u2018Instead of the one being deceived, the one doing the deceiving is the wrong one\u2019.</p><br/><p>No matter what.</p><br/><p>If this were a genuine negotiation and business discussion, me who was deceived would be the losing one.</p><br/><p>But that\u2019s wrong.</p><br/><p>This is a fighting scene where strength dictates the direction.</p><br/><p>In that case, there are plenty of things I, we, are able to do.</p><br/><p>First, I will hear Eva and Ruria\u2019s feelings.</p><br/><p>And then, decide what I should do.</p><br/><p>Without showing my disarrayed inside, I wait for the answer of the two with the usual face of Raidou.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It\u2019s not!</p><br/><p>Translator:</p><br/><p>Wow, just wow. This chapter changed my whole perspective regarding Makoto.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2013</p><br/><p>A *clang*clang</p><br/><p>I, Raidou-san, am holding a knife and a fork and eating a particular meal.</p><br/><p>Nom! Glomp!! Nom!\u2026.</p><br/><p>Beside me, there was an elegant Japanese style beauty that was only using a fork and was barbarically wolfing down the food in front of her.</p><br/><p>I should teach Mio some table manners.</p><br/><p>I need to have her \u2018act\u2019 the part in moments of need, at the very least. I seriously need to!!</p><br/><p>Well~ we attract attention.</p><br/><p>Aside from us, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any adventurer-like people around.</p><br/><p>The ones that are here are mostly guests that have come to have a meal and I feel like they are a different quality of customers compared to adventurers.</p><br/><p>I will be repeating myself but, that damn boy. He sold us the most expensive plan.</p><br/><p>He led us in a scared way to a high class restaurant that from the looks of it, it could even have a dress code.</p><br/><p>In a refugee camp you know?!</p><br/><p>Just how much of a luxury is this? Is what Makoto, Makoto tried to think. (In a certain younger sister way*)</p><br/><p>Misaka Misaka Ref</p><br/><p>I was wondering what kind of food would come out and when I arrived to the table I saw a knife and a fork.</p><br/><p>Heyhey, is it \u2018that kind\u2019 of food that will come out?</p><br/><p>And that\u2019s exactly how it went.</p><br/><p>So, with a meal that didn\u2019t betray my expectations, I began checking my surroundings.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s filled with people that look like royalty or merchants. I don\u2019t know if they are really royalty but I am impressed at how they are able to wear such clothes that look so hard to move in. This place is supposed to be the peak place for people that are looking to train themselves. It makes me question their sanity.</p><br/><p>Even if the adventurers had the money for it, I don\u2019t think they would come to such a stuffy place like this.</p><br/><p>Gorgeous looking food was spread out in every part of the place that could even serve as a refreshment for the eyes, and the black haired person beside me with her lively way of eating, that I try to mind too much.</p><br/><p>Thanks to \u2018that person\u2019 I couldn\u2019t feel the taste of the first decent food that I have received since arriving to this world, at all. Not a single bit.</p><br/><p>Even though I want to survey without being noticed, I am in a situation where everyone is watching us intently\u2026</p><br/><p>Of course, I am using [Sakai] to complete my objective thoroughly. Counting the observation of Tomoe and the tailers.</p><br/><p>In a size that enables me to pick up their conversations as well.</p><br/><p>Well, how do I say it?</p><br/><p>If Tomoe were here, she would most likely be jumping in joy.</p><br/><p>The shady conversations in here, are truly plenty.</p><br/><p>About the stockpile of weapons or the profit margin of comestibles, experiments, materials, etc.</p><br/><p>Without doubt, more than half of the people here are evil.</p><br/><p>Saying it in a magistrate of period dramas way, it would be \u2018Just how many sections are there?\u2019* (TN: Really not sure what he said. \u306a\u306e\u304b\u306d\u3048)</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t want to think that rich people = evil but, when the situation is like this it just can\u2019t be helped.</p><br/><p>Could it be that from now on I will be coming to this kind of restaurants in order to gather information? I don\u2019t mind though~</p><br/><p>\u201cWaka-sama, this food, the taste is good but, isn\u2019t the amount too small?\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Even when you stop the fork the only thing that is in your mind is the food. Just what should I do with you Mio-san?</p><br/><p>[N? This is not the kind of food that can be taken out so easily so there is nothing that can be done] (Makoto)</p><br/><p>There are people watching so I write words in front of my chest for Mio to see.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt will be finished with just a bite\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Mio really looks like she is sad. The fish that was probably smeared in a butter-like substance to increase the scent of it, that high class meal, was eaten in one bite.</p><br/><p>It was swallowed just like that.</p><br/><p>I see, it looks like the meuniere that is used on white meats. It has a scent that can be compared to butter but it\u2019s probably just a \u2018difference in worlds\u2019.</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s why you should use the fork and knife like this and slowly enjoy it] (Makoto)</p><br/><p>With words showing that I was already tired of it and pressure mixed in it, the color of Mio\u2019s face changes and she just nods.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know if she is being considerate or not. I mainly can\u2019t understand her.</p><br/><p>This is so complicated, more like, Mio is clearly having a complex expression while taking that knife in her left hand.</p><br/><p>You don\u2019t have to practice it today though, it can be at a later time. Are you having a desire to improve yourself?</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s okay if you slowly get used to it] (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I glance at the absent minded Mio.</p><br/><p>With how this is going, I feel like Tomoe will take out her own personalized chopsticks. I will have to warn her.</p><br/><p>The dishes are coming one after the other, it\u2019s nice to see that this place is as lively as a pub.</p><br/><p>We are underage so there is no sake though. In the past there was a time where I went with my friends to a pub and had a non-alcoholic party.</p><br/><p>That is what I would call a happy and enjoyable time.</p><br/><p>But.</p><br/><p>How unpleasant.</p><br/><p>The recent conversations that I have been hearing from my surroundings\u2026</p><br/><p>There are some that think we are upper class people, and that feels unseemly.</p><br/><p>It even gave me nausea. Ah~ the meal is so good. Probably. (TN: stress is making him unable to taste the food. He is going Naofumi on us)</p><br/><p>They are really thinking we are upper class people that have lots of gold, but I could only feel sarcasm from those words.</p><br/><p>At least that\u2019s how it was with the \u2018Incredibly rich people\u2019 that were in my surroundings.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t care if we are out here to learn about the world but, when the concept of level itself is different, I feel that that itself will become a barrier in our learning.</p><br/><p>The person in question seems to be having fun and it felt like an attraction. The virtue of her was not in the saving of money but in wasting a lot of it.</p><br/><p>When I took her to eat a hamburger, she said \u2018What is this clay that has flavor? Is this food?\u2019</p><br/><p>I felt like her eyes were glittering when she said that. They really were. (Far away eyes)</p><br/><p>No no, their levels are different. And they don\u2019t even seem to pay attention to the economic situation of their friend.</p><br/><p>They are fellows that have no influence in the economic powers\u2019 balance. Maybe it\u2019s because they have an amount of money that makes them think it\u2019s not important at all.</p><br/><p>In reverse, the people here.</p><br/><p>They use their friends to change them for money. That\u2019s the only thing they think.</p><br/><p>And the one that is even higher than these ones, is using large interests in order to get money to use.</p><br/><p>No matter how I think about it, I don\u2019t think I will be related to that super rich guy.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t think but\u2026</p><br/><p>The world\u2019s rich people all begin practically as thieves, burglars, raiders, that kind of types. In a hundred of years or so, they might obtain some dignity.</p><br/><p>Umu.</p><br/><p>The thing called life is so deep.</p><br/><p>The summary of the conversations the people around here had, was like this.</p><br/><p>The ones that have no money should just buy weapons and go hunt.</p><br/><p>If he can\u2019t get his hands on resources and raw materials, when he returns you just have to loan him dirt cheap money with low return time and you will get a nice guinea pig. It\u2019s as easy as baiting a kid.</p><br/><p>If he is able to get his hands on something you just have to invite him to a nice meal and retrieve the money. Commodity is alchemy my friend.</p><br/><p>I can understand the first part. If you are in the area of physical strength then the best way to gain money is using your body. On top of that, people that come here are mostly concentrating on training their bodies rather than gaining money so that might be a reason as well.</p><br/><p>But a guinea pig\u2026 That\u2019s a word that I can\u2019t just let slip by.</p><br/><p>They are selling weapons at a really cheap price and manipulating the person. If they bring things back it could be sold at a high price but the food and commodities are all rip-offs. And they have to stay in expensive inns.</p><br/><p>If they are unable to get anything they will have to rely on loans and their end will be to become \u2018guinea pigs\u2019.</p><br/><p>In the end, the money will return to them. Moreover, it will increase.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, the things that work as salvation; food, opposite gender, luxury, they sadly have to live with the reality that all of this things are being provided by the weak.</p><br/><p>A vicious circle, no, it\u2019s a well-made system created by the ones who obtain the profit.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause of the surroundings I can\u2019t even enjoy my food-desu wa ne\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>And.</p><br/><p>It still shows in my face.</p><br/><p>It seems that Mio is at least paying attention to her surroundings. Well that\u2019s the only thing she is doing, but I must admit that she is progressing. Umu umu.</p><br/><p>[I am sorry, it looks like it showed in my face] (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo no, I am the one that is pouring cold water in this meal we are having together-desu\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>??</p><br/><p>Now that I look carefully, I can see that Mio has a face that seems to be enduring something.</p><br/><p>This girl is not good at holding it in after all.</p><br/><p>Fumu, Is this what\u2019s called \u2018silliness\u2019?</p><br/><p>No nono.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s make conclusions leisurely.</p><br/><p>[Well, in the end it looks like we will be sacrifices to the hobbies of Tomoe. When I think about it I feel a bit pitiful] (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Because this is the path where you go \u2018divine punishment!\u2019</p><br/><p>Should I go \u2018I struck with the back of the sword\u2019?</p><br/><p>First I will be going all out.</p><br/><p>I will straightforwardly dance in the rain of blood.</p><br/><p>When I think about it rationally, I will probably be killing someone in the near future.</p><br/><p>However, I have been living for many years considering this as the highest taboo so there is nothing I can do about it.</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t think of doing it for real.</p><br/><p>If I fall into panic and can\u2019t do it, I still have Tomoe and Mio so there should be a way around that.</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t get a moment of leisure huh.</p><br/><p>Kill, kill, kill.</p><br/><p>Stab, slash, hit and kill.</p><br/><p>In the time of the Liz I had no intentions of doing it, it was an accident so I didn\u2019t feel much about it.</p><br/><p>At that time with the demon race I didn\u2019t know of their existence.</p><br/><p>In the cases of Tomoe and Mio, it was me instead who was fearing for life.</p><br/><p>When I imagine that the target will change to the human beings*. (TN: we meet again)</p><br/><p>I laugh, no, I am surprised maybe.</p><br/><p>That I can \u2018easily\u2019 think of a scene of me killing human beings.</p><br/><p>Though I don\u2019t really think I will not feel anything when I actually do it.</p><br/><p>That shouldn\u2019t be possible, it shouldn\u2019t be but\u2026</p><br/><p>I continued my meal while thinking about that anxiety inside of me.</p><br/><p>\u201cTomoe-san is wishing for conflict somewhere inside of her after all\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s because it\u2019s the first hour*] (Makoto) (TN: I don\u2019t get this idiom. \u306e\u3006\u3060\u304b\u3089\u306d)</p><br/><p>\u201c??\u201d (Mio) (TN: and Mio seems to have the same thoughts as me)</p><br/><p>Mio didn\u2019t grasp my words and had a confused face. This is quite picturesque. Umu, it means that beauties look good no matter what they do.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. Maybe I should go for a little walk. In any case, tomorrow we will be going to the commerce area. I should get a preview of the place and learn my way there while I\u2019m at it.</p><br/><p>I will just have Tomoe take care of the cargo.</p><br/><p>It also seems that Mio is drinking sake and is already done with the meal.</p><br/><p>By the way, I haven\u2019t drunk any. It\u2019s because I don\u2019t think this is a safe place to do that.</p><br/><p>And I also suggested that to Mio. Though I want to know if the effects of alcohol work the same way for them. (TN: you want to learn that with MIO?! I think Tomoe is a safer bet)</p><br/><p>Oh well, let\u2019s get going. She seems to be slightly drunk though. I also look up and fake as if I am drunk in sake, the \u2018two drunkards\u2019 play.</p><br/><p>If the tailers have something other than following in their sleeves, I feel that this will be time they will act.</p><br/><p>Now.</p><br/><p>Will an Oni appear or will it be a snake?</p><br/><p>[Lets go out, Mio. Let\u2019s walk for a bit] (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know if Mio understood the true meaning of my words but she jumped out of her sit and nodded vigorously.</p><br/><p>\u2014-</p><br/><p>Translator Note:</p><br/><p>Damn, I got shivers. So we are actually going to go that path? I am totally into that!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

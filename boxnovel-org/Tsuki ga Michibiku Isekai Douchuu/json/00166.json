I\u2019ve never worked so hard in my life.</p><br/><p>\u300cIs it really necessary to meet with the important people from other countries right now?\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>I unconsciously let out a complaint.</p><br/><p>This is needed, that is needed \u2013 In every meeting each night, one after another, additional materials are requested (in other words, my workload increases).</p><br/><p>In order to get the lectures at the academy started again as soon as possible so that academy city will appear as if it\u2019s returned to normal, I\u2019ve been getting nothing but unreasonable requests. (We\u2019re still in the middle of restoring the city and they\u2019re worried about the damn lectures; I wonder if they\u2019re idiots.)</p><br/><p>I have my hands full with this alone.</p><br/><p>Despite that, for some reason, the prince of Limia, the leader of Lorel and the important people from the temple are taking turns calling on us for assistance.</p><br/><p>I had to resist the urge to tell them to shut up multiple times.</p><br/><p>Today, we\u2019re fixing the main street.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s been about a week since we started on that, and quite a number of places in the street are looking like they\u2019re back to how they were before.</p><br/><p>However, the prospects for our shop still aren\u2019t looking good.</p><br/><p>The temporary stores near the temporary housing facilities have become important so even if we hurried to restore our normal store, it would actually be inconvenient for the customers. So we\u2019re putting that off until later.</p><br/><p>\u300cSensei, how can you even call this a lecture?!\u300d(Jin)</p><br/><p>Jin is shouting.</p><br/><p>\u300cSif and Yuno are working for the merchants\u2019 guild in the warmth, this is discrimination!\u300d(Amelia)</p><br/><p>Amelia is shouting.</p><br/><p>Indeed, today\u2019s wind is quite strong so it might be a bit cold.</p><br/><p>\u300cI don\u2019t think this is the work that we\u2019re supposed to be doing...\u300d(Izumo)</p><br/><p>Izumo is complaining as well.</p><br/><p>It seems that each and every one of the students attending my lecture is unhappy with its contents.</p><br/><p>The people here are my students, minus Rembrandt-san\u2019s two daughters.</p><br/><p>I wonder if those idiots have lost their minds. As soon as I returned to the academy I was told that they\u2019ve scheduled lectures to be resumed.</p><br/><p>Of course, I told them that the lectures can wait until academy city has calmed down a bit, but they went and said that they want lectures to resume as soon as the academy is up and running.</p><br/><p>My schedule for meeting people is packed and my business with the merchants is even busier, so it\u2019s not the time for... No, a lot of areas in the city are still in ruins, and there are a lot of people who lost their loved ones.</p><br/><p>People tend to forget the danger too quickly once it\u2019s passed.</p><br/><p>TLN: This was some weird expression, literally \u201conce it passes the throat, you forget the heat\u201d, so this is quite a liberal translation.</p><br/><p>Therefore, under the pretense of solidifying the foundations, we decided to demolish the various partially-destroyed buildings and have some people work on engineering works all day.</p><br/><p>Participation is mandatory.</p><br/><p>Right after the academy is finished, I\u2019m finishing the negotiations to get the personnel we need to restore the rest of the city. There\u2019s a considerable increase in the speed of the city\u2019s restoration if magic is used.</p><br/><p>Therefore, the participation of the people who can use magic is quite important.</p><br/><p>For some reason, Rembrandt-san heard about this beforehand and told us that he had assigned Sif and Yuno other work, so they managed to get out of it.</p><br/><p>Well, it might be a good opportunity for those two to watch and learn from their father\u2019s work up close, so I didn\u2019t force them to work.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s because you complain about this kind of stuff that you panic when facing mutants. Your weapons are crying, you guys.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300c... Raidou-sensei, now that I\u2019m talking to you directly, I was thinking.\u300d(Jin)</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat is it, Jin.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>As if he\u2019s fallen for my words, Jin is talking back to me.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou\u2019re the same age as us after all, aren\u2019t you? Actually, I get the feeling that you\u2019re younger than us.\u300d(Jin)</p><br/><p>\u300cAre you saying that it's a waste for me to be talking?\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cYou have more dignity in writing... Wait, that\u2019s not what I wanted to say. I was wondering whether the work would be finished sooner if Sensei were to participate. Since you\u2019re young and all.\u300d(Jin)</p><br/><p>\u300cI could consider it as long as I\u2019m not being made to do something bothersome like being in charge of the site. Well, if you guys don\u2019t proceed according to the schedule, I\u2019ll probably end up having to make it a regular part of the lectures.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cYou mean to say we haven\u2019t actually been assigned anything?!\u300d(Amelia)</p><br/><p>\u300cThe other guys are already getting lectures on practical skills at the academy, that\u2019s horrible!\u300d(Izumo)</p><br/><p>Amelia and Izumo interrupt the conversation between me and Jin.</p><br/><p>Even though they\u2019re girls around the same age as me, being looked down upon and glared at is enough to make me want to take a step back.</p><br/><p>\u300c... There\u2019s no way that\u2019s true. If I\u2019m working behind you guys at the site, we all have a collective responsibility and we\u2019ll all receive the same penalty.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300e... P-penalty?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300cA practice battle with Youthrie-kun, no, I\u2019ll add Blue-Lizard-kun and Zwei-san to the group.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300eImpossible, impossible, impossible!\u300f</p><br/><p>All three of their reactions were in harmony.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s pretty amazing synchronization.</p><br/><p>Incidentally, Youthrie-kun is the third Mist Lizard.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, or rather, unfortunately for them, they didn\u2019t have any opportunities to participate in the recent fighting. Even so, they kept demanding for lectures without understanding the situation, so I set up a mock battle with him for them.</p><br/><p>All of the students versus Youthrie-kun.</p><br/><p>They will make a formation with the weapons I\u2019ve given them, while Youthrie-kun will just be wearing elbow-pads and shoulder-pads, light protective equipment that won\u2019t slow down his movements.</p><br/><p>Yes.</p><br/><p>Youthrie-kun is an unarmed fighter.</p><br/><p>Apparently he was originally someone who found it easier to fight with his bare hands rather than use weapons, but he\u2019s a strange person who took a liking to some of the hand-to-hand fighting techniques in my memories and earnestly practised them.</p><br/><p>He ditched the dagger that he had been using for the sake of having a weapon, and now he\u2019s the one and only grappler in Asora.</p><br/><p>If you say that Blue-Lizard-kun has technique and Zwei-san has power.</p><br/><p>Youthrie-kun has both technique and power.</p><br/><p>In short, he\u2019s strong.</p><br/><p>He could have held back against them, but I requested that he kept that to a minimum. For them, his strength must have seemed like that of an emissary from hell.</p><br/><p>They were knocked down by Youthrie-kun like bowling pins in a strike.</p><br/><p>Their weapons were completely destroyed, and they were treated to a full course of being punched, kicked, thrown around and arm-locked.</p><br/><p>Seeing their fear, I\u2019m guessing it caused some trauma on them.</p><br/><p>They got their weapons fixed nicely by the Eldwas and they\u2019re back to normal, but even I was honestly surprised by Youthrie-kun\u2019s Wave Fist.</p><br/><p>\u300cSo do it seriously. In any case, I think assisting in the city\u2019s restoration would only be a good thing, for both the academy and yourselves.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300c... There are plenty of people among the townsfolk who are just trying to leech off of us and make profits, though. You\u2019re the one that\u2019s changed, Raidou-sensei.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ll make myself clear. For me, returning the city to normal is more important than giving lectures. That being the case, I\u2019m going to stop giving lectures for a while, you know? Students would have to reapply. Is it alright if I close my lectures for now?\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cThe way you\u2019re saying that. T-the rumor that you turned down becoming a full-time lecturer, was it actually true...?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah, I turned it down. I don\u2019t intend to feed myself by being a lecturer forever.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s a person that you can\u2019t apply common sense to! We\u2019ll do it, we\u2019ll work hard! Please spare us from having to reapply. The acceptance rate will be crazy! We shouldn\u2019t have said anything...\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou should have said that from the start. Even if you get kouhais, they\u2019re going to overtake you guys in no time.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>TLN: Kouhai means junior; as opposed to senpai which means senior</p><br/><p>For some reason.</p><br/><p>After hearing my last words, these three have stopped complaining and are showing a lot more spirit to work.</p><br/><p>In reality, I was joking about making them reapply, but I will have to accept new applications once everything\u2019s calmed down.</p><br/><p>I have to continue with my lectures for these guys, too...</p><br/><p>But if the uncomfortable feeling I had in Limia is correct, these guys might already be pretty strong right now.</p><br/><p>I have to give a little thought about how hard I want to train them.</p><br/><p>It wouldn\u2019t be funny if I created students that were stronger than the Knights\u2019 Order.</p><br/><p>I thought I was looking to raise elite students so I used the adventurers from Tsige as a baseline standard and evaluated the students on their individual specialized abilities. Looking back, that might have been a mistake.</p><br/><p>I\u2019d thought that this would be a basic requirement, but I have to set the level of being able to survive trips into the wasteland as a goal, too.</p><br/><p>Today, Shiki is portioning rations with Sairitsu-san from Lorel, and Mio is in Asora.</p><br/><p>Tomoe is helping with the transportation of goods around the city, so... Haah. We won\u2019t be seeing each other until the evening.</p><br/><p>I wish I could go back to the night of the party.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6</p><br/><p>The morning\u2019s work is finally finished.</p><br/><p>The students and workers are on their lunch break, so they\u2019re scattered around doing as they please.</p><br/><p>As for me?</p><br/><p>I have to go and meet some people for a little while.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ve given orders for what needs to happen with the repair work, so it\u2019ll be fine even if I don\u2019t come back for a few hours.</p><br/><p>As long as nothing bad happens, anyway.</p><br/><p>I have to meet the first person, so I head away from the main street and pass through the ruins of the Kuzunoha company, which is basically just rubble now.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, I\u2019m sorry about that, Raidou-sensei. Having you come all the way out here.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cPlease stop that. You\u2019re older than I am, Ester-san, and I am not your teacher, so you can just call me Raidou.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cIt is rather troublesome that you do not feel guilty for mentioning my age, Sensei. But for me to refer to my savior without an honorific is quite impossible. The boss has not arrived yet; would you mind waiting inside for a little while?\u300d(Ester)</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, I understand.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cI have to say, you surprised me since you suddenly became able to talk. You do seem younger than when you were communicating in writing.\u300d(Ester)</p><br/><p>Ester-san is looking at me like it\u2019s unusual for me to be talking normally.</p><br/><p>I rescued her from a mutant at the brothel near here, but I never imagined I\u2019d be meeting with her boss. I did think that it would just be lip service, though.</p><br/><p>He\u2019s a person from the underworld, so it\u2019s best if I keep a certain distance from him.</p><br/><p>Jin said it as well, but I wonder if sounding younger when I\u2019m actually speaking is a compliment or a bad thing.</p><br/><p>I just copied the spoken language, but apparently the impression people get is different.</p><br/><p>\u300cThis is a major event, after all. There might be an opportunity to take here. It seems the damage is less severe here compared to other areas; when is business scheduled to be up and running again?\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>Looking around, it seems that repairing the current buildings without having to demolish them first could work.</p><br/><p>That being the case, once the road is fixed, won\u2019t these people be able to return to their normal lives sooner than expected?</p><br/><p>\u300c... We\u2019re in the sex industry, after all. There is no way that people and business will return without the city getting on its feet. We cannot welcome people just because the building and the girls are safe.\u300d(Ester)</p><br/><p>\u300cIs there no demand from the people who have gathered here to restore the city?\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cFufufu. Demand, you say? They have to worry about the eyes of the city\u2019s people. A brothel does not stand out as something that is necessary. It is a business that is influenced by its popularity and the people\u2019s patronage, after all.\u300d(Ester)</p><br/><p>Is that how it is.</p><br/><p>I suppose there are services that can\u2019t be offered just because there is a demand for it.</p><br/><p>In that case, it\u2019s no wonder she\u2019s exasperated after hearing my useless talk.</p><br/><p>She\u2019s looking at me in a gentle way. Or more like, I feel like I\u2019m being viewed as a child, so I\u2019ll leave it at that.</p><br/><p>\u300c...\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cHmm, it seems that the boss has arrived. Well then, I will bring him here. In any case, I think he simply wants to thank you. He has a frightening appearance, but he has some compassion and kindness. And... No, I\u2019ll let you look forward to it.\u300d(Ester)</p><br/><p>Frightening appearance.</p><br/><p>It already seems like the type of person I\u2019m not good at dealing with.</p><br/><p>Oh yeah, that\u2019s right.</p><br/><p>Compared to Io\u2019s face, no matter how frightening he looks, there\u2019s no way a hyuman\u2019s appearance can be that scary.</p><br/><p>I imagine the face of the powerful giant.</p><br/><p>Ah, but.</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s a hyuman, I guess Zara-san would be a better comparison.</p><br/><p>Thinking about the trauma I got from that person, I think this person should be alright.</p><br/><p>\u300cMy apologies for making you wait. It seems Ester and the other girls from the brothel are greatly indebted to you... Raidou?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c... Representative Zara?\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>The face that I was imagining has appeared in the doorway.</p><br/><p>Eh?</p><br/><p>The person himself?</p><br/><p>\u300cEster, what\u2019s the meaning of this?\u300d(Zara)</p><br/><p>\u300cOh? Did you know each other already? There\u2019s no \u201cmeaning of this\u201d, he is the person who saved my life and his name is Raidou. He is a merchant running a small company.\u300d(Ester)</p><br/><p>\u300c... You, you had me meet with Raidou knowing that he\u2019s a merchant?!\u300d(Zara)</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, yes. He is still a novice, but he seems to hold a lot of promise. I thought I\u2019d let him meet with you, to return the favor he did for us.\u300d(Ester)</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s not the problem here!\u300d(Zara)</p><br/><p>\u300cPlease calm down, Boss. I can assure you that he has no hidden intentions. Though it seems you not only know of him, but rather, you are acquainted... Have I done something unnecessary?\u300d(Ester)</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, no. I see, he\u2019s Raidou, the one who saved you.\u300d(Zara)</p><br/><p>Zara-san lets out a sigh.</p><br/><p>To be honest, I want to let out a huge sigh as well.</p><br/><p>I want to be spared from having to come here without mentally preparing myself first.</p><br/><p>After a brief pause, Zara-san turns to face me and lowers his head.</p><br/><p>\u300cRaidou, thank you very much. I\u2019m very grateful.\u300d(Zara)</p><br/><p>\u300cWait, Representative. What I did is not such a big deal!\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cNo. You saved many of my employees. Showing this much gratitude is only normal.\u300d(Zara)</p><br/><p>Now it\u2019s become awkward.</p><br/><p>\u300cY-you were in ownership of these kinds of businesses too, Representative Zara? I am quite surprised.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>Desperately wanting to change the topic, I say the first thing that comes to mind.</p><br/><p>\u300c... Yes. I\u2019m in charge of these street-walkers and gambling. I\u2019ve crushed all of the others who were doing similar operations in other cities. I didn\u2019t plan for things to turn out this way, but I also have my own reasons for this.\u300d(Zara)</p><br/><p>The head of the merchants\u2019 guild, and the head of the underworld as well.</p><br/><p>It looks like I have my work cut out for me today.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t plan for this to happen, so it\u2019s amazing that I\u2019m doing this.</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that so? Well, I just happened to hear the screams of Ester-san and the others and came running to help. I do not have any intentions of making you feel indebted to me.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t really word it right, but I want to get across that I didn\u2019t do it to receive their gratitude.</p><br/><p>\u300c... Fu, you haven\u2019t changed. You still keep coming up with good answers. Even so, the Kuzunoha company has been spreading its name to the point of fiendishness. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m accepting Rembrandt\u2019s words, but it does seem that you\u2019re going in a different direction from regular merchants.\u300d(Zara)</p><br/><p>For one moment Zara-san has a strict look on his face, but then he lets out an exasperated sigh and begins talking.</p><br/><p>\u300cThe majority of your fellows who wanted to deceive you have died. Limia\u2019s second prince and the empress of Lorel have summoned you so that they can directly measure your usefulness. Don\u2019t get too thrilled with the people from the temple, either. I\u2019m not joking when I say that the one who has benefited the most from the mutant rebellion is you, Raidou.\u300d(Zara)</p><br/><p>\u300cHa, haah.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>Rather, the relations with those people are speeding things up unnecessarily.</p><br/><p>Incidentally, the empress of Lorel is Sairitsu-san.</p><br/><p>I\u2019d assumed that she was the wife of the emperor, but it\u2019s actually an important title given to the person in charge of that country\u2019s Priestesses.</p><br/><p>Sairitsu-san said herself that her name isn\u2019t really well-known, but surely that\u2019s a joke; the name of anyone with a high position in one of the four great powers should be quite well-known.</p><br/><p>... Not that I knew it.</p><br/><p>\u300cEven as a guild. There is a cost to having pushed them so hard for the transportation of goods. There aren\u2019t even supposed to be that many medicine stores in the first place. More or less, the guys trying to resume their trading are starting up in different businesses.\u300d(Zara)</p><br/><p>\u300cEh, that wasn\u2019t my \u2013\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cIdiot. It\u2019s not just for your sake. As long as you guys keep improving the quality and prices, there won\u2019t be a single store in the city that can compete with the Kuzunoha company when it comes to medicine. I was going to say this tonight. You should consider going in a direction to increase your sales, even if only a little at a time. Opening branch stores is fine as well.\u300d(Zara)</p><br/><p>\u300cBranch stores...\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>It\u2019s hard, because we won\u2019t have enough people.</p><br/><p>\u300cI have already mentioned this to Shiki... san, as well, but it would be helpful if you keep acting as a mediator with the academy to some extent. Right now, the reason the restoration of the city is progressing at a high pace is because we can use magic without holding back. We want to keep this up until it\u2019s all back to normal.\u300d(Zara)</p><br/><p>Why does he add -san to Shiki\u2019s name, but drop the honorific for me?</p><br/><p>Could he be thinking that I\u2019m his guardian?!</p><br/><p>... It\u2019s mostly true, so I can\u2019t deny it.</p><br/><p>\u300cFor now, I intend to continue making requests to the academy. As well as the transportation of goods around the city through Tomoe.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cThe woman who tamed the dragons even better than the Dragon Knights, huh. To be honest, I have things to say about your inexperience and ability. But I can only take my hat off to the sheer number of unorthodox methods at your disposal. To think that you\u2019d be using a tiger cub from Lorel instead of a carriage.\u300d(Zara)</p><br/><p>\u300cI thought that everyone in the Dragon Knights were strong.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300c... How so? I went to see them once, but they\u2019re nothing more than decorations. Under that woman\u2019s directions, they moved like a unit of flying dragons and they were barely fearsome at all.\u300d(Zara)</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, hahaha.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cAt this rate, even if only in appearance, Rotsgard\u2019s cityscape will probably return to normal in about a month. As the head of a guild and as a manager of prostitutes. I\u2019ll say it once more. Thanks, Raidou.\u300d(Zara)</p><br/><p>Not only Zara-san, but Ester-san imitates him as they both lower their heads in a bow.</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t really get used to this, being bowed to by a representative.</p><br/><p>\u300cI would also like to thank you. From now, if I show any flaws, please guide me, Representative Zara.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cI will, whenever Rembrandt-san gets angry at you... Now that I think about it. As thanks for saving the prostitutes, when this road\u2019s shops reopen, I\u2019ll let you in for free. What do you say, Raidou?\u300d(Zara)</p><br/><p>... As he raises his face, its expression has completely changed.</p><br/><p>Ah, he\u2019s got an unpleasant look on his face.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat do I say? I\u2019m only half a man, and I do not partake in such activities.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOne flaw I see in you is these ambiguous answers you give. Well, I\u2019ll interpret that in my own way. In that case, from now on, this brothel is free for the Kuzunoha company. Use it as you like. I\u2019ll give an order to use your stores for their daily necessities. That\u2019s my way to show my thanks, and as my payment to keep your mouth shut about me being the manager here. I\u2019ll trust you with that. Well then, sorry for taking so much of your time. Both of us are busy people, but you have to put your best efforts into tonight\u2019s meeting.

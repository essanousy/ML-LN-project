That revolution?</p><br/><p>Rembrandt-san nodded when I asked for confirmation, so there\u2019s no mistake.</p><br/><p>When he said \u2018this country\u2019, did he refer to the Aion Kingdom?</p><br/><p>In other words, people that can start a revolt against the royalty have appeared.</p><br/><p>\u2026Eh? Isn\u2019t that a big deal?</p><br/><p>Why is Rembrandt-san so calm?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, a revolution. Regarding the details, I will be telling you as I teach Raidou-dono, but well, in terms of the time\u2026I think it will start moving by summer.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201cSummer?! T-There\u2019s already less than a half a month left!\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Even if Aion Kingdom is not a frontline country that is fighting directly with the demon race, it is one of the four major powers.</p><br/><p>If a big country, that\u2019s at the rear and is in an alliance with Limia and Gritonia, begins a civil war, it would be no time to do war with the demon race.</p><br/><p>No no no.</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t this a lot more important than my resolve?</p><br/><p>If this country falls into civil war, even Tsige might get enveloped in the flames of war.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t want to think this is true but\u2026could it be that this is also related with the demon race?</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha, an organization that has been caught before doing their move, wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything big like a revolution anyways. Catching them with a margin of half a month is already superb, Raidou-dono.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way, this matter was not orchestrated by the demon race. It is not like they are completely unrelated, but they are not deeply related either.\u201d (Morris)</p><br/><p>Morris-san read my mind.</p><br/><p>Even so\u2026I think that a big affair like a revolution happening in half a month is outrageous, and I think that half a month passes by quickly.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s what I think, but\u2026</p><br/><p>It seems like Rembrandt-san and Morris-san think that half a month is plenty enough time.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so, what did you want to consult with me regarding the revolution?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cUmu. I will be direct. I want you to witness and hear your opinions about the way Tsige will move at that time.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>The way Tsige\u2026will move?</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd I wanted to hear about Raidou-sama\u2019s thoughts regarding this revolution. That\u2019s what it would be.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201cMy thoughts, is it.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>In the first place, I don\u2019t know much of Aion Kingdom.</p><br/><p>Frankly speaking, aside from Tsige, I don\u2019t know of this country.</p><br/><p>If I remember correctly, it is a country that excels in information gathering, and their cavalry unit.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s the most I know.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry but, I don\u2019t know the condition of Aion Kingdom itself, so I don\u2019t have any sort of opinion in it.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Thinking about it once, I spoke my honest thoughts.</p><br/><p>This isn\u2019t the moment to try looking good.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201cHah?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo well, that way is better, is how I should say?\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201cUhm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you had an opinion regarding this country itself with knowledge beforehand, I would of course want to hear that as well. However, what I want to hear more than that is how Raidou-dono views \u2018revolution\u2019 itself. It would be strange to call this a normal revolution but, Raidou-dono, what do you think about this?\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>So that means it doesn\u2019t have to be centered in Aion huh.</p><br/><p>A revolution.</p><br/><p>It is a vague image, but it would mean that the tops of the country would change, right?</p><br/><p>Mainly by force or by illegal methods.</p><br/><p>And if as a result, the revolution is successful, the government and economy will change as well.</p><br/><p>If asked what I think about it, it would be that the allies will change depending on the times and society.</p><br/><p>If the government was good, there wouldn\u2019t be a revolution to begin with, so if a bad government was going rampant, a revolution is a valid path for change.</p><br/><p>There would be a lot of side-effects because of it, but\u2026I wouldn\u2019t say it is completely wrong.</p><br/><p>In that case, my thoughts about it would be that depending on the situation, it is a valid method.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it would be the correct method in all situations, but I do think that there\u2019s times when a revolution is necessary.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cHoh!\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d (Morris)</p><br/><p>I thought they wouldn\u2019t like this incredibly vague answer of mine, but the reaction of the two was of simple surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid I say anything strange?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026No. I was just surprised that you didn\u2019t consider revolution as evil.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf the government is corrupt, a revolution is bound to occur. I think there\u2019s times when that happens. And when it is a revolution in those cases, I think it is something necessary.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou see, a king that rules over the country, is someone that has been given the right by God to do it.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>The Goddess huh.</p><br/><p>But that\u2019s quite the valid way of thinking.</p><br/><p>Like, the king has the right, so he can rule the country.</p><br/><p>How was it called?</p><br/><p>I remember I learned it in world history.</p><br/><p>\u2026The divine right of kings? </p><br/><p>Ah right, that\u2019s the one.</p><br/><p>In the case of this world, it actually happens, so it is not a simple expedient though.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeaning, the temple and the general populace think of revolution as absolute evil.\u201d (Morris)</p><br/><p>Morris-san supplements the explanation.</p><br/><p>I see.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why my way of thinking that \u2018it is necessary depending on the situation\u2019 is already heresy in itself huh.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s be careful about that from now on.</p><br/><p>In the first place, this is the first time I have talked about the topic of revolution, so I doubt there will be more times to come.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, I have said something bad. Sorry, I will be careful.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I think Raidou-dono is in the right. But well, it isn\u2019t something that you can disclose in public, so you are correct in taking note of it.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, thanks.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cFumu. But with this, it has made it a lot easier to say.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201cSo true.\u201d (Morris)</p><br/><p>It seems like Rembrandt-san and Morris-san were saying something to each other with their eyes.</p><br/><p>Is it my imagination? Even when we are in the reception room, it feels kind of stormy here.</p><br/><p>\u201cRembrandt-san? Could it be\u2026you are participating in that revolution?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I nervously ask this.</p><br/><p>I heard from him before that he wouldn\u2019t become a merchant that profits from war, but if he was in favor of the revolutionary forces\u2019 believes, it is plenty possible.</p><br/><p>Because he wouldn\u2019t profit from it after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am unrelated.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I see.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cCurrently, that is.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLater, I will give you the documents pertaining the revolution that will be occurring in Aion. Well, if I had to summarize it, I would say, they are an amusing bunch of idiots.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that no good then?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cUmu, that\u2019s right. It is no good. This is something that\u2019s felt daily in the government officials of Tsige as well, but it is truly no good at all.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d (Morris)</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t me but Morris-san who nodded seriously.</p><br/><p>Rembrandt-san emphasized that it was \u2018no good\u2019 twice, but is it that much?</p><br/><p>I have not seen the government officials appointed in Tsige, but if they are people evaluated in this way, it is probably for the best that I didn\u2019t meet them.</p><br/><p>\u201cRaidou-dono, do you know who Tsige belongs to?\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>Rembrandt-san asks me while maintaining that tired expression.</p><br/><p>Well, I at least know that much.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I remember correctly, a noble\u2026I think it was the fourth prince.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>He is still young.</p><br/><p>If I count the time since I heard this, he is probably 6 years old now.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. The current king had given this land to this fourth prince he dotes on so much, soon after he was born.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>Tsige was gifted to a baby?</p><br/><p>That\u2019s pretty sad.</p><br/><p>In that case, the king owned this town before that.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo until then, Tsige was owned by the king, right?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Is it a territory that is in direct control of the country?</p><br/><p>Well, since it is a gift from father to son, there\u2019s probably not going to be nobles who would take it away from him, so in a sense, it is valid.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cW-What is it?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>When I asked for a confirmation, the two of them simple stared at me silently.</p><br/><p>Unable to take it anymore, I speak out, and Rembrandt-san did a small sigh and began speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Tsige is the second most prosperous land in Aion. This is a number simply going by the payment of taxes though.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh~\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s impressive.</p><br/><p>It is certainly true that it is a lively place and it is in the wasteland as well.</p><br/><p>The transit of people is intense, and I did know that it had power as a town, but to think that it was the number two town in Aion for their payment of taxes even when they are a remote region like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe primary disadvantage is the distance it has from the capital, but in terms of population, economic scale, its location of being the entrance to the wasteland, being the ending point of the Golden Highway, and the adventurers\u2019 quality; the worth of this town cannot be measured.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201cRight.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd the king has given the rights of this town to a kid that literally doesn\u2019t have the ability to do anything.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>Ah.</p><br/><p>I see.</p><br/><p>Now I understand the reason of why Rembrandt-san is dismayed.</p><br/><p>Conferring the rights of Tsige to someone, means that the person who conferred it holds incredible authority.</p><br/><p>Giving authority like that to a kid would only stir the people around into having disagreeable thoughts, and in the first place, it wouldn\u2019t serve as anything good for that kid.</p><br/><p>No matter how cute that kid was, this is not a correct decision for a father to his son.</p><br/><p>To bring your fondness into governmental affairs is not good. </p><br/><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cA king that would do something as stupid as throwing away his own authority. Even though he is already in a complicated position where he has so many children that it is creating problems regarding the successor, he still did something as stupid as that. If he was aiming for that when he did it, then he is quite the schemer.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom the sound of it, he wasn\u2019t aiming for it.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though he is still in good health, he easily relinquished a town that offers money to the country as if it were trivial. He did that, and yet, he didn\u2019t place a capable and loyal subordinate as a set for this action of his. I can understand the emotions of the people that want to cause a revolution. At those times, I sended people disguised as aborigines and attacked him night after night.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u2026A-Attacked him.</p><br/><p>Just how pissed were you?</p><br/><p>It is true that it was gifted to a child, but it is not like their everyday life would change.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Since then, the newly appointed government officials were all nobles that have been influenced by the mother of the fourth prince and has been changing constantly in that way. This type of people are not rare in the nobles, but they were all people that only sucked off this town as much as they wanted.\u201d (Morris)</p><br/><p>Morris-san complemented the explanation once again.</p><br/><p>Well, that\u2019s something.</p><br/><p>The worries must have piled up at mach speed.</p><br/><p>It truly affected the daily life of the people.</p><br/><p>No wonder he wanted to punch him.</p><br/><p>Well, it is not like Rembrandt-san himself is punching the king. It is simply his aborigin disguised people that are secretly punching him, so Rembrandt-san probably held back quite a lot.</p><br/><p>If those government officials don\u2019t know about what was happening to the king, it would simply be releasing stress after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cPetty officials that are crazy in the head, and idiotic generals, that have muscle for brains, were coming and going. It was a crisis that remained in the history of Rembrandt company. Seriously, there\u2019s a limit to doting on your children.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201cA crisis that would remain in the history of the company?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>But I feel like Rembrandt-san is also the type who doesn\u2019t have a limit when doting his children though.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey tried to put their hands on my wife and daughters, and after receiving strange marriage proposals, I judged it had already surpassed the limit and did a few things. Anyways, they were noisy about raising the taxes and demanding money, you see. No matter how much you try being rational with them, talking with that bunch just doesn\u2019t work. They always say: \u2018Understood. Then, when can you ready the money?\u2019\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>I have dealt with people like that from time to time. The type of people that understand words but conversation is useless huh.</p><br/><p>Those kind of people are annoying.</p><br/><p>In my case, I could just have Tomoe and Shiki deal with them and ignore it, and it would be resolved later, but how do you deal with people like that in reality?</p><br/><p>Anyways, tax huh.</p><br/><p>I know that Rembrandt-san is a merchant that possesses incredible power in this town, but he was someone that could even participate in the decision of the taxes?</p><br/><p>I feel like that surpasses the domain of a single company.</p><br/><p>\u201cTaxes, is it. But in that case, wouldn\u2019t it be a lost cause if the government officials just decide for it to be that way?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it were the usual, then it would be just as Raidou-dono says. But they are people as well. It is possible to indoctrinate our side\u2019s thoughts into them. The most simple method is to entertain them.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>Entertain huh.</p><br/><p>Entertain the government officials, hear their thoughts, request of them, and place your own side\u2019s thoughts in them.</p><br/><p>I see.</p><br/><p>\u201cEntertain, is it. Then the taxes were also dealt with at that time?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cOmitting the details of it, yeah, that\u2019s right.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is thanks to master that Tsige only has to face the current amount of tax burden, Raidou-sama.\u201d (Morris)</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way, what\u2019s the tax currently?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe visible rate is 30%, counting the personnel and goods, 10%. In total, it would be around 40% of our income most of the time.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>40%.</p><br/><p>Since he mentioned the other 10% is not visible, that means the residents view it as a 30%.</p><br/><p>Even so, it is still a pretty impressive number.</p><br/><p>If you gain 10, 4 of it would be taken and you would only be left with 6.</p><br/><p>But from how Morris-san said it, it seems like even this is already good, so this place must be in the normal boundaries or lighter.</p><br/><p>I wonder how much is the normal amount.</p><br/><p>For the people paying, it would be best if it were closer to zero, but if that were the case, the community service would become worse.</p><br/><p>\u201c40%.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe nobles wanted to make it at least 70% though. If that happened, the town might dry to its death -even if it\u2019s Tsige. This is simply my personal opinion based on experience, but once the tax surpasses half of the income, it only brings negative results.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>70% is just too exaggerated.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no way someone would be able to live that way.</p><br/><p>Even the desire to work would be gone with a 70%.</p><br/><p>Moreover, what\u2019s that about \u2018at least 70%\u2019.</p><br/><p>Did they want to make it even higher than that?</p><br/><p>But the topic about half being the limit, that Rembrandt-san speaks of, also sounds unreasonable.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s terrible. But how were you able to turn that unreasonableness into 40%?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cSimple. From the 70% that they want to take, we pay the other 30% from our own pockets as bribe money. It is not like we have become saints or anything. If the town dies, we wouldn\u2019t leave unscathed either. And in the first place, I carry a considerable amount of responsibility for this town.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>When Rembrandt-san mentioned: \u2018Carrying responsibility\u2019, his expression turned complicated.</p><br/><p>While showing strong determination, there was also regret, sorrow, and affection mixed in it. Something that the current me would definitely be unable to make.</p><br/><p>He has lived in this town for a long time, experienced a lot of things, and worked on his company here, so he probably has a strong attachment to it.</p><br/><p>Even so, the bribe is most likely an outrageous amount.</p><br/><p>I feel like it would be best to not ask the amount of gold.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt must have been quite the severe battle.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Right now it has calmed down though. And so, there\u2019s the background of it as well. The current state is that we are stuck with that crazy bribe amount, and we also have to help in gathering confidential information. Because of that, not only the Rembrandt company, all the companies in Tsige have a bad impression of the Aion Kingdom.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand that sentiment.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Or more like, it would be a mystery if they were able to pledge loyalty to a kingdom like that.</p><br/><p>That would be impossible.</p><br/><p>Even I am beginning to think if Aion Kingdom is okay doing all this.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so, regarding this time\u2019s plan for revolution, I haven\u2019t reported it to the country yet.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201c?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I were to report it now, the revolution will probably end as a small insurrection.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>He has no intentions of reporting it.</p><br/><p>In other words, he plans on having the revolution occur.</p><br/><p>\u201cExperiencing this upheaval that has lasted for about one year, looking at this Tsige that has been changing each passing day, my way of thinking has changed quite a bit you see.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I am most likely one of the reasons why.</p><br/><p>The change of Tsige, as well as the one who changed Rembrandt-san\u2019s way of thinking.</p><br/><p>I can tell that I am involved in it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have been thinking this since a long time ago. I wonder, are the country and nobles really necessary for the government and management of a town?\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In the case of Tsige, nobles take turns coming to this town and supervise it for several years before leaving.</p><br/><p>Moreover, it seems like they don\u2019t do much work.</p><br/><p>In that case, with how the current Tsige is, even if the nobles are gone, the government and the administration would have no problems.</p><br/><p>But if they maintain that, Tsige would be disconnecting itself from the Aion kingdom.</p><br/><p>Looking at it in terms of security, I feel like it would turn into a minus.</p><br/><p>No matter how you pick it, Aion Kingdom is still one of the major powers.</p><br/><p>Rembrandt intends to turn Tsige independent.</p><br/><p>He intends to use the revolution that will occur in Aion as the trigger.</p><br/><p>As long as it is viewed as a town that creates a lot of wealth, even if they are in a remote region, the Aion Kingdom will most likely not accept something like independence.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why it has to be now.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is still not even at the level where we can question if there\u2019s form as a nation though. At present, we plan on forming a municipality with several representatives of households, and first have Tsige reborn into an independent land. In my perspective, this is something that has steadily become more of a realistic goal as time goes on, but Raidou-dono, what are your thoughts?\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>An independent land.</p><br/><p>As I thought.</p><br/><p>Rembrandt-san knows the exact population of Tsige, the percentage of food supply that can be self-supported, the fighting force that can be dispatched at once, the amount of goods coming and going from the wasteland, and the connection it has with the surrounding towns.</p><br/><p>Lately, I heard that Mio and Shiki have been staying quite a long time in the port town that has been developing, and have been exchanging things with a good amount of people.</p><br/><p>From my view, Rembrandt-san is a merchant with plenty experience.</p><br/><p>If a person like that has reached the point where he asks someone like me, he probably has already received implicit consent from his surroundings or obtained a promise for cooperation.</p><br/><p>He is definitely not the type that would put his greed and wishes as the priority and do something unreasonable, and yet, he has laid bare his thoughts of independency, which means, he most likely has a proper amount of confidence and foundation for independence.</p><br/><p>Of course, if possible, I want to help him out.</p><br/><p>But if he is putting his confidence in my Kuzunoha Company, then that would be slightly troublesome.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn my eyes, Tsige is the place where I began my business for real. It is like a second homeland to me. If separating from Aion is connected to the benefit of this town, I am personally in favor of it. But I currently am not able to declare how much cooperation I will be able to provide.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>If it drags the Kuzunoha company as well, I can\u2019t make a prompt decision.</p><br/><p>I will first discuss this.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s my standard.</p><br/><p>This time it is just deciding how much we will cooperate, so in essence, my position in this has already been mostly decided.</p><br/><p>But to promise what I will be doing at this moment, wouldn\u2019t be good.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have any intentions of being on the kingdom\u2019s side?\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201cNope, I don\u2019t.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>No chance of that.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no reason at all for me to betray Tsige.</p><br/><p>It is the homeland of Lime, and the people working here are being well treated.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuh\u2026Is that so. So at the very least, you will support the idea utilizing the revolution to gain independence.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>Rembrandt-san looked relieved as he smiled.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s cruel.</p><br/><p>Was he thinking I would become scum or something?</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any obligations for Aion kingdom to the point of betraying Tsige.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cI do know that. Just that, if the very idea of utilizing the revolution in order to gain independence went against the believes of Raidou-dono, I was thinking about abandoning the idea of independence.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026To do something like that because of me is just\u2026\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why Morris and my close aides had discussed for several days things like: the methods to evacuate the people that hate fighting, and the protection of people that are not fit for battle, in order to convince Raidou-dono.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201cAha\u2026hahahaha. There\u2019s no need to mind me. If it\u2019s Rembrandt-san, you should be able to do those kind of things.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>In order to convince me alone, the tops of Rembrandt company gathered and did meetings.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s that? That\u2019s not funny.</p><br/><p>If I remember correctly, it was Sofia, right? The one who could destroy a few countries on her own.</p><br/><p>Being treated as that kind of existence by a part of the people. What a complicated feeling.</p><br/><p>Even for Rembrandt-san, I probably look like a jack-in-the-box.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is certainly true that I thought it more thoroughly while having Raidou-dono in mind. Also\u2026even if it\u2019s not facing the country directly, we are still going against a major power, so we have to think about a lot of things.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u2026That way of thinking about \u2018a lot of things\u2019 is something that I have abandoned as well.</p><br/><p>Even if it\u2019s impossible immediately, I will have to learn one step at a time.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIn other words, this is truly a convenient moment. Raidou-dono, since there\u2019s the chance, use this opportunity to watch and learn.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201cHah?! Well, it is certainly true that a real revolution and an independence will serve as incredible teaching material, but\u2026\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>What if I am asked for a report after all this is over?!</p><br/><p>If I am dragged into it, it wouldn\u2019t be the time for learning!</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the end, there\u2019s no better learning experience than mixing in the actual place of the action. Not by standing at the front and acting, but by being one step back and watching. It might become an incredible learning material.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>Uh.</p><br/><p>Saying \u2018incredible learning material\u2019 without thinking, might have been bad.</p><br/><p>Even if I am like this right now, compared to my past self, I don\u2019t immediately say things without thinking that much.</p><br/><p>I am aware that my verbal slips have decreased.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way, Raidou-dono, why do you think a mere merchant like me, who is planning something so outrageous like making the remote region of Tsige independent, going through such lengths to even tell you this?\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s probably because Rembrandt-san knows about this town the most and it is the result of you gathering information of the outside as well. Also, maybe because you have identified a big incident like that of a revolution beforehand.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>He said he would take advantage of the revolution after all.</p><br/><p>How to say it, he does look like he has more confidence than before, and this is not overconfidence, but I feel it has something to do with me being in favor of it.</p><br/><p>Of course, I won\u2019t be saying it out loud though.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s part of it. Putting more to it, your previous approval has given me quite a lot of confidence. But the direct impetus for this thought of independence was my contact with a certain person, and this was the result of learning that person\u2019s nature.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201cContact with a certain person, is it. Who\u2019s that?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no doubt that the ones who would benefit the most from the trouble of hyumans would be the demon race.</p><br/><p>But this time, there\u2019s no way it is the demons.</p><br/><p>Rembrandt-san has a pretty good amount of people that sympathize with him, like: Zef and his son. But Morris-san said that there\u2019s not much interference from the demon race.</p><br/><p>The demons are being careful of me, and even if they did it, the most they would do would be to bring out money or lightly stir up someone.</p><br/><p>Not only Senpai and Tomoki, every direction of Limia and Gritonia; I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anyone there who would be able to become the reason for why Rembrandt-san would wish for independence.</p><br/><p>His back is probably filled with people that are against him, so those kind of people would be the very definition of people who would want to crush the revolution.</p><br/><p>Since Lorel\u2019s territory is adjacent to Aion, they are not directly fighting with the demon race.</p><br/><p>\u2026But they are a country that has deep religious believe in the Water Spirits that are subordinates of the Goddess.</p><br/><p>In other words, it is impossible to ask the temple to accept the revolution in the first place since it is viewed as evil.</p><br/><p>As I thought, the highest possibility is an Aion noble.</p><br/><p>Since it would lead to the decline in national power, the chances are low, but the most possible one would be an Aion noble or someone influential.</p><br/><p>A person that approves of the revolution, and a noble that is in a standing of influence.</p><br/><p>Someone like that cooperating with Rembrandt-san sounds plausible.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it a noble from a big household in this country?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cFufu. Thinking about it reasonably, it is one of the possibilities that you can arrive at.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>I missed!</p><br/><p>Even though I had quite a bit of confidence in that one!</p><br/><p>\u201cI was wrong huh.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Raidou-dono who wants to learn about society, this can be considered an interesting reality. Well then, let\u2019s have you meet with that person. But well\u2026I don\u2019t think this is your first time meeting that person though.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Eh?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>With the sign of Rembrandt-san, Morris-san who was at the door, turned the knob and invited someone into the room.</p><br/><p>She looked at me, but without changing her expression, she made a deep bow.</p><br/><p>Why is this person\u2026</p><br/><p>In my surprise, I couldn\u2019t find any proper words to speak.</p><br/><p>Unable to open my mouth, my mind was simply in chaos.</p><br/><p>\u201cRaidou-dono, it\u2019s been long. To think that you would help out in Limia, I am truly grateful for that action of yours.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026yeah.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I somehow manage to gulp.</p><br/><p>This person is the person that I had excluded just a moment ago.</p><br/><p>Thinking about it normally, there\u2019s no way she would be here, and no way she would sympathise with Rembrandt-san.</p><br/><p>Why?</p><br/><p>Just, why?</p><br/><p>\u201cThis might be the first time I see you so surprised.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>Rembrandt-san laughs amused.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Sairitz-san.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Lorel\u2019s empress, Saritz. It makes me happy to know that the merchant-dono who\u2019s the current talk of the time\u2019s, remembers my name.\u201d (Sairitz)</p><br/><p>The empress of the Spirit temple in Lorel Union.</p><br/><p>Why is a person like that in a place where the conversation is about using the revolution to gain independence?</p><br/><p>Moreover, it seems like she knows the situation.</p><br/><p>After Sairitz-san, a number of people enter the room as well.</p><br/><p>From within them, there\u2019s people I have seen in Tsige, and there\u2019s also people I see for the first time.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow then, since we have now gathered here, let\u2019s begin by laying bare our thoughts and positions so we can begin the talk. Don\u2019t worry, this is just to let first timers know. No need to proceed the talk in a smooth manner. First, we will talk about our opinions. I have prepared light meals and drinks, so let\u2019s proceed without tension.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>I-I take back what I said.</p><br/><p>I already want to abandon my thoughts and return to Asora.</p><br/><p>At this moment, I was not simply over my capacity, I was feeling something incredibly scary.</p><br/><p>This is definitely not how you begin learning something!</p><br/><p>Why is it that in this world, it always begins from the messed up parts?!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

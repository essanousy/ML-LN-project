But the people that saw them off didn\u2019t shiver one bit and acted firm.</p><br/><p>But the state was slightly strange.</p><br/><p>From within their group, there were many shadows that didn\u2019t belong to hyumans.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow then, by the time they return, I need to have another report ready.\u201d</p><br/><p>From the two that were at the front of the group that saw them off, one of them opened its mouth. The voice that came from the slightly small body was the voice of a woman.</p><br/><p>But the figure of the girl was not that of a hyuman.</p><br/><p>\u201cT-They are really going to meet the demon race. As always, what an unpredictable person.\u201d</p><br/><p>Another one also opens its mouth.</p><br/><p>This one is also a woman. A hyuman this time.</p><br/><p>\u201cEva, we are returning. Is that okay? Having crops that can be grown in winter, you did tell me that proudly, so we will be continuing with that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEma-san, I did say I had some in mind, but what\u2019s important is that there\u2019s not enough arable land for planting. First we should cultivate new land and keep an eye on the progress of\u2014\u201d (Eva)</p><br/><p>\u201cI have already confirmed it. Slow. Honestly speaking, the actions of you girls are just slow. In the future, I won\u2019t be accepting excuses blaming the winter. Ah also, I will be checking the tax rate again.\u201d (Ema)</p><br/><p>\u201cUuuh, about the tax rate, because we are beginning at a point where we have practically no national treasury, I think that currently, this is the time where we have to save as much of the country\u2019s money as possible. Of course, I did put the livelihood of the residents first and placed a tax rate that is on the level of the large countries. I did it with the belief that this was the most conventional method of tax rate.\u201d (Eva)</p><br/><p>A conversation between Eva and Ema.</p><br/><p>Even if their names are similar, their standings seem to be quite different.</p><br/><p>Most of all, it was a conversation of a hyuman and a race that\u2019s not hyuman, so it is quite rare for the hyuman to be the one at the lower standing.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s conventional about a 7:3 government. Waka-sama has gone through the trouble of arranging the residents and entrusted their lives to us, no matter the race, I won\u2019t accept starvation and dying from cold.\u201d (Ema)</p><br/><p>\u201c7:3-what?\u201d (Eva)</p><br/><p>\u201c*The land-tax system from the Edo period* would work better in this situation. Seriously, something as important as getting a country, and the concerned party in charge of the ruling only has this level of intelligence. I can only call it stupid. In this country where there\u2019s a mixture of hyumans and demi-humans, there\u2019s no way we can use the common sense of hyuman\u2019s country creation.\u201d (Ema) </p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Sorry.\u201d (Eva)</p><br/><p>In this scolding that could be taken as unreasonable, Eva honestly apologizes.</p><br/><p>Because in the while that she has been acquainted with the woman called Ema, she has more or less understood her skills and personality.</p><br/><p>Eva didn\u2019t understand the meaning of the words 7:3 government or the land-tax system of the Edo period, but Ema must have judged that the tax system she was about to set was not the most appropriate one.</p><br/><p>(I thought that the Orc race, even if their names and figures were different, they were all simple-minded people who were driven by instinct. Highland Orcs, those girls, I don\u2019t know where this race inhabits, but they have knowledge on the level of scholars. Though imperfect, I was a librarian at the Academy, and yet, I can\u2019t hold a candle to these people. Raidou-sensei, the people supporting you from the back, there\u2019s really not a single normal one.) (Eva)</p><br/><p>Eva was introduced to Ema by Makoto the moment they arrived at Kaleneon.</p><br/><p>\u2018She is a kind and dependable person.\u2019 Is what he said as he made her face an Orc.</p><br/><p>Eva who had pledged in her heart to throw away her common sense and stop thinking that things are abnormal, had her determination crushed in an instant.</p><br/><p>To think that there would be a scene in her life where she would have a conversation with an Orc, Eva wouldn\u2019t be able to imagine it even in her wildest dreams, so it couldn\u2019t be helped.</p><br/><p>Having her native country destroyed, losing her territory, and condemned by her relatives; in that severe standing, Eva who was half-controlled by madness, met Raidou- Makoto \u2013 at Rotsgard, and that madness of hers was blown away.</p><br/><p>With these consecutive events outside the boundaries of common sense, maybe she is getting her sanity back, or it is just that a new type of madness is dyeing her now; she probably doesn\u2019t know clearly yet.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about the other situations?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ema turned to her back.</p><br/><p>There stood a blue scaled Lizardman, an orc that has a bigger build than Ema, a white winged winged-kin, and a dwarf who has around the same height as Ema.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Right. Leaving aside Eva\u2019s words, isn\u2019t there any place that can be reclaimed currently? If it\u2019s new land for cultivation, we have quite a lot though. Also, if we just pointlessly reclaim leveled ground, in the current state where we can\u2019t deal with the mamonos, it would be meaningless.\u201d</p><br/><p>The first one to respond was the Lizardman.</p><br/><p>\u201cDeal with, are you referring to that level of demonic beast? Within the populace that has come to Kaleneon, there\u2019s adventurers and former adventurers. In terms of experience in battle, there should be a reasonable amount though?\u201d (Ema)</p><br/><p>Ema\u2019s face turns serious at the report of the Lizardman.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are many that still haven\u2019t adapted to the environment in this country. Also, we are lacking people with genuine talent. After the invasion of the demon race, the amount of hyumans that are used to doing work in a snowy environment are most likely low. In the first place, if there were survivors of people that lived around this area, the situation would have been slightly different.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t?\u201d (Ema)</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are only a few. Experienced in battle, there are zero. These probably has already reached your ears as well Ema-dono, but the bunch here are people that had been living by relying on the blessing of the Goddess. It is questionable how much knowledge they have about living in independence.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Even if we have new land, security will be necessary. But there are few who would be able to properly guard against the mamonos, is what you are trying to say?\u201d (Ema)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how it is. There\u2019s a few adventurers, on a degree that we can barely use properly. It would be more realistic to bring more from the outside with requests, or having us assigned to it. According to the result of the investigation, the demonic beasts that inhabit this country are more active in winter. From the report of Eva saying that if we are to do training it should be at a time other than winter, the results of that investigation are most likely not far from the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood. Cooperation with the outside. Regarding the topic about bringing adventurers in, I will leave it as a suggestion for now. It would be pointless if we are the ones doing everything after all.\u201d (Ema)</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it. But is it okay to continue the training and guarding for now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. I will be counting on you.\u201d (Ema)</p><br/><p>At this occasion, Eva barely spoke anything.</p><br/><p>But there was no displeasure in her face.</p><br/><p>It is not that she is hiding it.</p><br/><p>In the time that she has been in contact with the mamonos and demi-humans that Raidou has introduced her to, she had decided in her heart to learn their common sense.</p><br/><p>The lines they are demanding are absurd, but in the first place, the very point of obtaining a country is also in the crazy and reckless class.</p><br/><p>Raidou and the Kuzunoha Company that were able to accomplish that very feat in a land that was completely in control of the demon race, there\u2019s no need to say that it is nothing but abnormal.</p><br/><p>But she was the one who relied on them, and the whole current situation is that she has no one else to rely on in Kaleneon aside from them.</p><br/><p>In that case, she resolves herself to move in the same standards as them.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why she is in the middle of learning.</p><br/><p>Ema and the other people are definitely not looking down on Eva.</p><br/><p>They are not taking her lightly either.</p><br/><p>They are only taking the action of training her as a proper representative of a country.</p><br/><p>Scarily strict.</p><br/><p>Eva was in a spot where even if she were to break, they wouldn\u2019t let her.</p><br/><p>After the Lizardman stepped back, Ema looks at the Orc.</p><br/><p>But the Orc who was looked at, shook his head to the sides.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to report on my side. We continue to collect information about the demonic beasts while securing food. Regarding the hunting, there\u2019s the point that it is centered in the adventurers, and its progress is reasonable. From Ema\u2019s perspective, it would probably be around 80% in terms of numbers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 So the other 20% is not catching up huh. Do you think we can still increase the number of people in charge?\u201d (Ema)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 There would be no problem, but if we want to certainly avoid unforeseen events, I would suggest we leave a few. Increasing the numbers is not always good. For us the guardians, and also for the people that do their best in hunting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood. I will be arranging it, so for now, I will leave it to three.\u201d (Ema)</p><br/><p>\u201cRoger that.\u201d</p><br/><p>After the short talk between Orcs, next is the Winged-kin that took a step forward.</p><br/><p>Within the people here, it is the one who has the closest appearance to a hyuman, but the wings at its back negate that possibility. There\u2019s also several special traits that are different from a hyuman. Eva was greatly surprised when she learned that they are an heretic existence even among demi-humans.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no problem in the security of the national border. There were sightings of people that seemed to be demons, but they haven\u2019t invaded. There have been cases where some have ignored our warnings, turning into a fight. But we were able to crush them. There was no damage from our side.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood work. Then, is the number of personnel for the security and other tasks appropriate at the moment?\u201d (Ema)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need. The people that are put in charge of security are beginning to have free time in their hands. Because they are getting accustomed, the area they can be in charge of increases. This is thanks to Tomoe-sama\u2019s training in the techniques to search enemies. There won\u2019t be any problems in placing some in other tasks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. That\u2019s a great thing to hear. Then can you put out some candidates later?\u201d (Ema)</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kaleneon is a special country that has a cliff as their national border.</p><br/><p>Its security has been tasked to the Winged-kin who possess the ability of flight, and they haven\u2019t permitted any to invade.</p><br/><p>To enter the current Kaleneon, it is completely necessary to have the permission of Kuzunoha Company.</p><br/><p>And the last to step forward is the dwarf.</p><br/><p>Before saying anything, he already had a troubled face.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow then, what should I begin with?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs the deployment of tools being delayed as expected?\u201d (Ema)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because in the current Kaleneon, no matter how many craftsmen like us are, it would never be enough. If there were more residents here specialized in the earth element, the situation might be a little different though. But the lack of personnel has reached a helpless level. Even so, we are in a situation where we can\u2019t bring out more personnel from our ranks. I have suggested this before but, is it not possible to call other dwarfs to be residents? There\u2019s a number of volcanoes at Kaleneon, and I have checked it out; it seems to be a relatively good environment for dwarfs to live in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout that matter, we are waiting for the decision of Waka-sama. But it seems he is hesitating since they would probably have to recruit from Lorel Union.\u201d (Ema)</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel bad for troubling Waka-sama. But I don\u2019t think the dwarfs of Lorel have any attachment to the Union. Because no matter where we are from, we are craftsmen at heart. Even if we exclude the ones who went to the Spirit religion, it wouldn\u2019t be a problem if the dwarfs themselves approve of it. Can\u2019t you tell him this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will try and see. Just that, Waka-sama is in that state probably because it might turn into a situation where we are chipping off the national power of Lorel Union, so I am not sure if it will help in having him make a decision though.\u201d (Ema)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is true that we would be taking potential away from their country if we were to bring them in. He even thinks about such difficult things. Anyways, we are lacking people on our side. Whether it is hyuman or demihuman, if there\u2019s anyone interested in being a blacksmith, I would like you to tell me immediately. Armors, farming tools, constructions; there\u2019s a mountain of things to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am sorry for having you go through so much work. I will try to take into consideration any candidates by today.\u201d (Ema)</p><br/><p>\u201cI am counting on you. We will gather up the information of the dwarf community\u2019s special traits in Lorel and anything that might prove useful for Waka-sama into documents. I will send them to you when we are done.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat would be a great help. Well then Eva, I think you already know but, we will be sleeping at the same time as always. Let\u2019s return.\u201d (Ema)</p><br/><p>Eva who was lending an ear to their conversation with interest, stiffened her face at the sudden words of Ema.</p><br/><p>Every other side has already turned to town and beginning their return.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs always? Uhm\u2026 I feel like in these three days, I haven\u2019t slept properly at all though. Is that what you are referring to as \u2018sleeping at the same time as always\u2019?\u201d (Eva)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are properly sleeping for 1 hour already. I have given you aiding medicine so that you don\u2019t have any problems in health though? Are you telling me you haven\u2019t been taking them?\u201d (Eva)</p><br/><p>\u201cI am! It is because I am taking them that my heart is weary but my body is strangely energetic! How long will this kind of situation continue for?!\u201d (Eva)</p><br/><p>Eva, who was doing her best a few days ago, unable to see the end of this nightmare, she objects at the statement that was as if telling her this is how it will normally be.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow long? Obviously, it will be until you have grown enough that you don\u2019t need our assistance. You are already an adult and still unable to give proper responses after all. Do give it your best.\u201d (Ema)</p><br/><p>\u201cProper responses?! I was suggested such an absurd plan just like that! On top of that, Raidou-sensei didn\u2019t seem to have much knowledge in politics and management!!\u201d (Eva)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you trying to do by placing Waka-sama as a comparison. It is pointless. Lady, can you nonchalantly split earth?\u201d (Ema)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow stupid. Now, straighten your back and walk proudly.\u201d (Ema)</p><br/><p>Ema rejects the cry of Eva and quickly walks forward.</p><br/><p>Chasing after her, Eva desperately tried to straighten her back that felt as if it would bend at any moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cEva, becoming a representative of a country is not something simple. Knowledge, wisdom, power. In this situation where we are living without getting involved with foreign countries, we can still look for stability. In the future when diplomacy begins, it will not be in this proportion. If you don\u2019t grow at a pace faster than what Ema-dono is setting, the future of Kaleneon will be dark.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeriously. You yourself don\u2019t have that overwhelming appeal that brings others together after all. The residents here are people that didn\u2019t live here originally, so bringing people together is a harsh talk though. Knowledge and wisdom. And the easiest to obtain is knowledge. Desperately learn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThings like nobles and royalty; because you are hung by such things that are determined by heritage, you act spoiled when in a position of having land. If you want to stand on top of others, you will have to be able to show them something worthy of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt may be a dream that came from being half-crazed, but since it has been granted, you will have to undertake the responsibility. Give it up, you can\u2019t escape.\u201d</p><br/><p>Catching up with the Lizardman, Orc, Winged-kin, and Dwarf; Eva received grateful words from them.</p><br/><p>A wry smile was plastered onto her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt might be more comfortable if I just end up crazy like in my time at Rotsgard.\u201d (Eva)</p><br/><p>\u201cMadness huh. That might be good too. It would certainly give you more resolve and power than what your current self has.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s important is for you to have power befitting that of a ruler and are able to make decisions. There\u2019s no need to be sane for that. Isn\u2019t that fine?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour results could disappoint Waka-sama. Even if you have to go crazy, you will have to show good results.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter how you end up, you will fall into the same situation, so isn\u2019t sanity playing a big part in your happiness?\u201d</p><br/><p>Merciless words came flying.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, please don\u2019t spoil Eva-san. This girl will be carrying Kaleneon and lifting it up after all. She is a person that has exchanged such a contract with Waka-sama. To get it easier by going crazy is just\u2014\u201d (Ema)</p><br/><p>\u2018There\u2019s no way I would permit it.\u2019</p><br/><p>The last words that came from Ema were all reflected in the eyes of the others which were directed at Eva.</p><br/><p>Eva hangs her head.</p><br/><p>The revival of a ruined country.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s a miracle.</p><br/><p>And yet, it has been granted.</p><br/><p>Then, the price of it, its compensation; no matter what it is, she has to pay it.</p><br/><p>It has turned into something unbelievable.</p><br/><p>Thinking that, Eva walks while looking forward.</p><br/><p>If she were to meet her past self, she felt like telling herself to look properly at reality.</p><br/><p>She held that small sentiment in her.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6</p><br/><p>A thick mist is still covering the surroundings.</p><br/><p>Already knowing that this is not a strange occurrence around these parts, the girl was thinking that it would have been better if mist hadn\u2019t come out today of all days.</p><br/><p>Crossing her arms, she waits for the guests.</p><br/><p>At her side there\u2019s a giant with four arms, and just like her, he was silently standing there.</p><br/><p>At their back, there were elite demon soldiers lined up completely armed.</p><br/><p>A twitch.</p><br/><p>The giant opened his closed eyes and looked at the front.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeems so. There are three.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt would have been better if we had a clearer view, today of all days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. We are going to welcome that, and yet, having our vision this bad makes me feel uncomfortable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGuests huh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCalling him Devil would be rude, right? It seems that time it wasn\u2019t his true intentions. I think it would be proper to call him Raidou.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. Io, let me tell you just in case. Don\u2019t go creating any trouble until we reach the capital, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI return those words right back at you, Rona. After being dealt with so easily, there\u2019s no way I would have hostility or anything like that. I only feel dread.\u201d (Io)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is to the level that our Demon General ace has voiced out his dread. Moreover, for some reason, we are meeting them right at the center of our territory.\u201d (Rona)</p><br/><p>Rona let\u2019s out a sigh.</p><br/><p>She who is specialized in gathering information, was letting out her weakness at the guests that she couldn\u2019t grasp.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t show this to the person in question through force of personality. Even she was showing slight weakness in a stage where they haven\u2019t made contact yet.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is around a few tens of kilometers from the place that Reft had disappeared in huh. He doesn\u2019t remember what happened at that place, and the reconnaissance of Kaleneon is also\u2026\u201d (Io)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo results. At most, we only know that there\u2019s a cliff where in the past there wasn\u2019t. It is also unknown if there\u2019s a bridge placed on it or not though.\u201d (Rona)</p><br/><p>\u201cThere have been casualties in our forces, right?\u201d (Io)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe ones that went too deep were wiped out. The whole unit is gone, so we don\u2019t know what happened at all. It is hard to think that they are the ones involved in this, but the timing is just too fitting.\u201d (Rona)</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the end, the best choice would be to wait for Reft\u2019s memories to recover huh. As long as there\u2019s no more real harm, Kaleneon is not a place with important value for us. There\u2019s no need to increase the damage by poking it.\u201d (Io)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is mortifying but that\u2019s how it is. Right now we have no choice but to leave it.\u201d (Rona)</p><br/><p>(\u2026 I will be interfering a little from outside the army though.) (Rona)</p><br/><p>Rona adds this inside her mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut if they are involved with the abnormality of Kaleneon as you say, and on top of that, they are having us meet them at a place close to it\u2026\u201d (Io)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Kuzunoha Company, and also Raidou; they would be a sly bunch. That man didn\u2019t seem like the scheming type though.\u201d (Io)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Yeah. It seems like he has made his appearance.\u201d (Rona)</p><br/><p>Io and Rona correct their posture.</p><br/><p>From the mist, three shadows appear and their figures were soon visible.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid we make you wait much?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man at the very center looked at Io and Rona, and said this apologetically.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. In terms of time, I would say you are early. Welcome, Raidou-dono. And also your companions. Because of security reasons, we couldn\u2019t provide you a teleportation service. I thank you for your understanding in that. From here there\u2019s still quite the distance, but we will take responsibility in guiding you. Sorry for the late introduction, I am Io. I serve under the Demon Lord as a Demon General.\u201d (Io)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know already but let me do it again, I am Rona. Just like Io, I am one of the Demon Generals. It has been a while, Raidou. We have been waiting anxiously for your meeting with our Lord. I thank you for accepting this unreasonable request of ours.\u201d (Rona)</p><br/><p>In contrast to Io\u2019s words, Rona gives a frank greeting.</p><br/><p>Her expression was also serious and straight-laced, and her smile was gentle.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuzunoha Company\u2019s representative, name\u2019s Raidou. Pleased to make your acquaintance. These are the friends I mentioned before, Mio and Shiki.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cMio-desu. Pleased to meet you.\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cShiki. I will be in your care.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>After Raidou made his introduction, the other two at his side make a light introduction as well.</p><br/><p>The black haired girl wearing a black kimono introduced herself as Mio and seemed somewhat cold.</p><br/><p>The red haired man wearing a white robe was gloom and composed. He introduced himself as Shiki with a smile. His introduction also had a notable attitude.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, it will be a journey of several days. Let\u2019s depart.\u201d (Io)</p><br/><p>With the words of Io as a signal, the demon troops arrange their formation.</p><br/><p>In this territory where hyumans have not stepped into for several decades, and the untrodden territory further beyond that hyumans have not arrived to; the Kuzunoha Company representative, Raidou, makes one step into it.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

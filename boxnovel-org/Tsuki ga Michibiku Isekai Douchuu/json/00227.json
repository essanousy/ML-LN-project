font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>Chapter 227: Source of Naivety</p><br/><p>It is already the fourth time, so honestly, there\u2019s no freshness in it anymore.</p><br/><p>For now, the most I am is relieved that the one in front of me is not Root.</p><br/><p>There was no assurance that it wouldn\u2019t happen even if I didn\u2019t have the intentions of doing it myself after all.</p><br/><p>On the contrary, there are times when I intend to do things but it doesn\u2019t turn out the way I want it to.</p><br/><p>Serwhale-san is good to the point that I want to make him a follower, but there are things both of us have to consider, and couldn\u2019t reach the point of a pact.</p><br/><p>Becoming a follower means that, at the very least, he will be separated from his race.</p><br/><p>That person is a Neptune, and he is currently the pillar of Asora\u2019s sea.</p><br/><p>It would be one thing if he were to just act together with me temporarily, but to form a pact and make him \u2018my\u2019 follower felt slightly bad.</p><br/><p>Instead of establishing a standing for Serwhale-san with a pact, he said that it would be fine for him to just act as the representative of the sea residents and obey orders simply as one of the residents of Asora.</p><br/><p>In terms of strength and standing, he who is the leader of the Neptunes, can even do something like being the manager of the sea, so turning him into my follower would actually be a waste.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no Superior Dragon who manages the sea.</p><br/><p>And from what I have heard, the Neptunes existed since ancient times in the sea and are strong.</p><br/><p>The Neptunes are a race that makes me wonder if they are actually the replacement of a Superior Dragon for the sea.</p><br/><p>\u201cMakoto-sama, what are you thinking?\u201d</p><br/><p>Within the magic circle that was drawn for the sake of the pact ritual, Touda talked to me.</p><br/><p>She noticed that I was spacing out huh.</p><br/><p>We are enveloped by a red light and are waiting for that light to settle down.</p><br/><p>Even if we call it a ritual, it is not as if the concerned party will be doing anything.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s thanks to Tomoe and the others who have advanced things promptly.</p><br/><p>In the first time, Tomoe was the one who did the process, and in the time with Mio, I was unconscious.</p><br/><p>At the time with Shiki, Tomoe and Mio schemed to mix Shiki with used rings, so I didn\u2019t have anything to do with that.</p><br/><p>I truly haven\u2019t done anything in my pacts.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I was just thinking that it has been a while since I have increased the numbers of my followers.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cIn order to not have Makoto-sama regret that decision, I promise to support you in private and public matters to the best of my abilities.\u201d (Touda)</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I feel like I am hearing a marriage pledge here.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Even so, every single one of Touda\u2019s words didn\u2019t register as sincere inside of me.</p><br/><p>Am I growing distrustful?</p><br/><p>If we form a ruling pact, she won\u2019t be able to do anything drastic, and I do think that it would be impossible to attempt any vicious plans, but\u2026</p><br/><p>I probably can\u2019t be relieved just yet.</p><br/><p>I am simply accepting this to a certain extent.</p><br/><p>Of course, I am also expecting her to become a fighting force in our defenses.</p><br/><p>Doubts.</p><br/><p>\u2026That\u2019s right, doubts.</p><br/><p>Since I have noticed it myself, I can\u2019t just pretend I didn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>The red light that is enveloping me and Touda had appeared as a wall between the space where Touda and I were facing each other.</p><br/><p>The pact is finally over.</p><br/><p>Signs that it has finished without any problems, and proceeded as always.</p><br/><p>Now then, what shape will Touda take?</p><br/><p>She looks human to begin with, so I guess her appearance won\u2019t change much.</p><br/><p>Since it is a ruling pact, I don\u2019t think her human form will change.</p><br/><p>I am the one that doesn\u2019t need to change form, so the light at my side settled down before hers.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I silently wait for the light at Touda\u2019s side to settle down.</p><br/><p>I am thinking about calling her *Sakura*. </p><br/><p>It may be simplistic, but she is in a Shinto shrine where there\u2019s cherry blossoms, and we are doing the pact in the day of the cherry blossom viewing, so I thought that name would be fine.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this\u2026my new body?\u201d (Touda)</p><br/><p>I was expecting it, but the naked Touda that was in a crouching position, stood up and muttered this.</p><br/><p>What is this? Something is\u2026</p><br/><p>Touda casually stood up and looked at her lifted arms, and subsequently turned her gaze at her limbs.</p><br/><p>I see, she looks young.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s not much point in the age of their appearance, but Touda looked quite older than me.</p><br/><p>Right, like a girl in her mid-twenties.</p><br/><p>And yet, her body had turned into that of someone around 10 years old.</p><br/><p>Based on the indicator that I have created from the standards of this world with beautiful outward appearances, she is without doubt around 10 years old.</p><br/><p>How to say it, this is a familiar sight.</p><br/><p>Even when I look at the naked Touda right from the front, I was slightly moved by the fact that I wasn\u2019t agitated.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow are you feeling? Are there any problems?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cMakoto-sama\u2026I am feeling excellent. I didn\u2019t think my power would increase this much with a ruling pact. It is a pity that my wish of fighting Makoto-sama at full-power will never become reality though.\u201d (Touda)</p><br/><p>She is in a ruling pact after all.</p><br/><p>Even if she had my permission, she wouldn\u2019t be able to fight with her full strength.</p><br/><p>Tomoe and the others always complain about that a lot.</p><br/><p>Saying that: \u2018If I could bring out my full power, I would be able to last a little longer.\u2019</p><br/><p>Touda, who said this devilishly while laughing, probably feels like that too.</p><br/><p>\u201cRejuvenation. There\u2019s also the case of Shiki, so it isn\u2019t something strange.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cHe turned from bones to hyuman after all. If it is only turning your looks into a brat, there shouldn\u2019t be much difference.\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Tomoe and Mio were observing Touda with composure.</p><br/><p>Tomoe looks slightly happy.</p><br/><p>Well, that\u2019s understandable.</p><br/><p>Aside from the change in Touda\u2019s looks and age of her outward appearance\u2026there\u2019s her hair.</p><br/><p>The color of her black hair had changed into a dark emerald green.</p><br/><p>Like the color of a forest.</p><br/><p>But her specialty is fire, and she served a God of Japan.</p><br/><p>And yet, green.</p><br/><p>Her black hair still looked more connected to her abilities, but this one is unexpected.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected, she didn\u2019t deviate from her human form.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>Shiki seems to have been thinking the same as me. He looks at Touda with serious eyes as he mutters.</p><br/><p>Touda confirms her own look, and after nodding a few times, she mutters a chant and puts on her shrine maiden clothes.</p><br/><p>So there\u2019s magic to change quickly?</p><br/><p>How convenient.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, Makoto-sama, I wish to receive my name.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. Touda\u2019s new name will be: Sa\u2014\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c?\u201d</p><br/><p>I was about to say Sakura, but for some reason, I stopped.</p><br/><p>Because a different name suddenly flashed in me.</p><br/><p>What should I do?</p><br/><p>No.</p><br/><p>Sakura is no good.</p><br/><p>I was already feeling uncomfortable with it.</p><br/><p>I feel like conferring a name like that to someone is no good.</p><br/><p>\u201cWaka?\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cWaka-sama?\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Tomoe and Mio looked at me, who was hesitating in speaking, with worry.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry. Your new name will be: Tamaki.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cTamaki\u2026is it.\u201d (Tamaki)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Once again, best regards.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Why did the name Tamaki suddenly appear?</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t a single of my acquaintances with that name though.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Makoto-sama, senpais, from today on, my name will be Tamaki. Please take care of me.\u201d (Tamaki)</p><br/><p>Touda lowers her head deeply -no, Tamaki.</p><br/><p>My new follower.</p><br/><p>However, she is clearly a follower with a different implication to that of Tomoe and the others.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Then, Tomoe. I leave the rest to you.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I will properly teach her the rules of Asora. We will be using her in the future, so I will teach her about the Mist Gate as well\u2014\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout that, it is fine to just teach her how to move around Asora with it.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by that, Waka?\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Without answering, I just wave my hand and turn my back.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will leave for a bit. If the cherry blossom viewing continues till the night, please let them, okay? I will also return when it is night.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Telling them this, I disappear from the place.</p><br/><p>I teleport to my room and make some half-hearted preparations before heading to the wasteland.</p><br/><p>Teleporting to the place where there was a base once called Zenno, I flew to a certain direction.</p><br/><p>Maybe because there are a lot of mamonos around here that can feel to a certain extent if it is an opponent they can handle, there were no encounters, and in less than an hour, I arrived at my objective.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I remember correctly, it was around here.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>As far as one can see, there\u2019s reddish-brown ground with no change in sight.</p><br/><p>The place where my parallel world life began.</p><br/><p>It truly has nothing to the point of being funny.</p><br/><p>And, even in this border of the world, I was able to reach here in a short amount of time.</p><br/><p>That reality felt kind of amusing and made me want to laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201cThinking about it, time has passed in the blink of an eye huh.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>A monologue that no one would hear.</p><br/><p>Since coming to this parallel world, I was attacked by Tomoe, obtained something called Asora, was attacked by Mio\u2026</p><br/><p>Thinking so many times that I should change, I have reached this point without changing my foundations.</p><br/><p>\u2026That\u2019s what I intended.</p><br/><p>I have\u2026changed.</p><br/><p>Before I noticed, I had changed.</p><br/><p>At the very least, I have become a completely different being from the me in Japan.</p><br/><p>If there\u2019s hostility and are coming for my life, there\u2019s no problem in fighting back, and as a result, I have taken lives, which is something that can\u2019t be helped.</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s thoughts of only that extent, it might have been normal.</p><br/><p>But the current me is different.</p><br/><p>I now think that battles to the death are as normal as breathing.</p><br/><p>At first, it was only towards people that directed killing intent towards me.</p><br/><p>A little bit in the past, all the people that had the will of fighting and were standing in the battlefield.</p><br/><p>And now, almost all the lives that have been born.</p><br/><p>I have ended up thinking that it is only natural to kill and be killed.</p><br/><p>Hyumans and demi-humans have been taking away lives just by being alive after all.</p><br/><p>Adventurers being controlled by greed and getting killed by mamonos, mamonos swarming into a village and killing everyone in it; I have begun thinking that they are the same thing.</p><br/><p>If it were in my time at Japan as a high school student, I wonder if I thought of lives this lightly.</p><br/><p>Since when was it?</p><br/><p>Since the time when variants ran rampant in Rotsgard?</p><br/><p>Or was it the time when I was unable to fight back against the Goddess and was made to fight in the capital of Limia in the end?</p><br/><p>Was it when I was visiting a variety of countries along with the demon race country?</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know.</p><br/><p>It might even be by the time when we were talking about raising animals like cows and sheeps in Asora and I had grown able to eat them like normal.</p><br/><p>But, the time when I clearly felt this change was slightly after my conversation with Senpai in Limia.</p><br/><p>My thoughts regarding the lives in a battle, I began feeling that my thoughts were totally different compared to many of the soldiers.</p><br/><p>Honestly, I am beginning to feel like morals are something faint.</p><br/><p>This is scary.</p><br/><p>The surface of my thoughts should feel that morals and life are important, but deep inside, it feels as if it isn\u2019t resonating at all. A bizarre feeling.</p><br/><p>Maybe that\u2019s why the times when I fall into deep thought have increased.</p><br/><p>I have consulted with Tomoe and the others about matters of the company and Asora, but talks about me are a different matter.</p><br/><p>Matters regarding what I should do with myself, isn\u2019t something that should be consulted with someone else.</p><br/><p>This is something that I should decide myself.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no need for the input of others, no matter who it is.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf the cause was because I have killed too much, I can\u2019t turn back anymore. It would be something that can\u2019t be helped.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>The result of me killing too much is that now I feel it is the same as breathing and it is something that\u2019s closely related to me. If that\u2019s the case, it is already too late.</p><br/><p>Because it is already that way after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it is not like I can\u2019t act normally. It is not impossible to act within reason, so that should be fine.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>No matter how much worth I find in life, I can still consider life as important.</p><br/><p>Leaving aside people that I am deeply connected with, most people probably wouldn\u2019t be able to notice.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe problem is the other point. A problem that doesn\u2019t concern only me. This one is the bad news.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>The other problem I noticed when thinking about myself.</p><br/><p>That is\u2026there\u2019s something I have been purposely avoiding.</p><br/><p>I do feel like I have been doing it unconsciously as well, and there are times when I did it purposely.</p><br/><p>In other words, a serious illness.</p><br/><p>I\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI have been running away from evil.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>The evil intent that\u2019s directed at me from others.</p><br/><p>The evil that\u2019s distributed unfairly in society.</p><br/><p>Even in Japan, and in this parallel world as well.</p><br/><p>I have been running away from it.</p><br/><p>If it came to facing it, I chose to shut down my thoughts and silence it.</p><br/><p>Even in my future, I was simply thinking about succeeding the bow dojo of master and live a life where I taught the arts of the bow and continued training myself. That\u2019s how I thought.</p><br/><p>In terms of marriage, I was thinking that I would simply marry someone at an adequate age.</p><br/><p>Of course, I didn\u2019t have a specific person in mind.</p><br/><p>If succeeding the dojo was not possible, I was thinking about possibly working as a civil servant at my hometown. Anyways, I only thought of it vaguely.</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t picture myself competing against people for things like promotions, and I thought that those things didn\u2019t suit me.</p><br/><p>There was no point in thinking about it, and I am no genius or prodigy, so I thought it wasn\u2019t something that I should aim for.</p><br/><p>\u2026I was fine with life by simply having my bow and my hobbies.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s how it was.</p><br/><p>This didn\u2019t change even when I came to a parallel world.</p><br/><p>At first, I thought that I was simply running away from the difficult things, but I was able to absorb things like the world\u2019s history and the configuration of magic, so it is probably something different.</p><br/><p>The evil of adventurers, the merchants\u2019 evil; in this world where greed is covering its whole surface, there have been times when those schemes were pointed at me, and there were many times when I was involved in them.</p><br/><p>At those times, even when I made countermeasures for it, I always coped with it in a half-hearted manner and ignored the root of it.</p><br/><p>Or at times, I would just leave it to Tomoe and the others.</p><br/><p>At the time with Rembrandt-san and the curse disease, it was specially dreadful, but even in that time, I wasn\u2019t really that interested in the cause of it.</p><br/><p>What I thought was that it wouldn\u2019t be funny for people to die from something like that.</p><br/><p>Even the strange accusations of Illumgand who was like a half-psychotic person, I didn\u2019t pay him much attention.</p><br/><p>Because he wasn\u2019t someone that posed a threat. Even so, if he were to attack with force, I would fight back, that\u2019s all.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t direct my eyes to the background of the story.</p><br/><p>Because you know, no one would want to touch a muddy business like that.</p><br/><p>If possible, you would prefer to just live your life without knowing.</p><br/><p>Right?</p><br/><p>If I had decided on things faster, would things have taken a different turn?</p><br/><p>Even to this day, I still think about those trivial things.</p><br/><p>Just how pointless this is. I have already understood this well since coming to this world.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe eyes of Touda\u2026of Tamaki, were the eyes of evil.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I think it was a complex color of emotions.</p><br/><p>Even if I call it evil, I think it is not only that.</p><br/><p>There was clearly fear and good will as well.</p><br/><p>But there was malice too.</p><br/><p>How to say it, it was that strange atmosphere -that strong pressure. Now that I think back on it, I feel like it was similar to the sensation when the Goddess told me to do something unreasonable, and when I first met Rona and Zef.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. Those were the eyes of someone suppressing something.</p><br/><p>\u2018The day has finally arrived where I see those kind of eyes in Asora\u2019, is what I thought at that moment.</p><br/><p>That it was already too late.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026That\u2019s why I won\u2019t let Tamaki out of Asora. I will have her become a follower that will defend Asora to the very end.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>With that, her malice will not become that much of a problem.</p><br/><p>We have formed a pact already after all.</p><br/><p>I will have her manage the Shinto shrine and the temples normally, so it will be killing two birds with one stone.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Well then, let\u2019s go.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>At the place where it all began, a resolution was made.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u201cOh! Raidou-dono, it\u2019s been long.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been long, Rembrandt-san. Even though I am being rented a room, I don\u2019t show up much. I apologize for that.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to mind. We also wanted to talk to you -no, consult with you about something, so I was thinking of asking you when you were available.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>Evening.</p><br/><p>I had gone to the Rembrandt residence in Tsige.</p><br/><p>When I tried to make an appointment in order to meet him as fast as possible, I received an answer from the receptionist saying that they would make time for this evening.</p><br/><p>To think that I would be able to meet a busy person like him in the very same day.</p><br/><p>\u201cConsult? Rembrandt-san with me? Could it be something happened to your daughters?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I haven\u2019t done anything strange to Sif and Yuno, and I haven\u2019t informed those two about anything that I would feel ashamed of.</p><br/><p>If it is a consultation from them, there\u2019s no real need to be so formal about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, they are living a fulfilling everyday life. Thanks to Raidou-dono.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201cI am happy that you think that way.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I do. And so, Raidou-dono, what is your business? It would be great if I can be of assistance.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>If he can be of assistance huh.</p><br/><p>From what I know, he is the most suitable for it.</p><br/><p>Probably.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou see\u2026\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>With a slight pause, I harden the resolve inside of me.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease teach me the evil of people.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Hoh? Evil, is it. This is one strange request.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201cEvil, or how to say it, society, maybe? I don\u2019t know how to describe it. I do have a clear image in my mind though\u2026\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I could tell that the eyes of Rembrandt-san and Morris-san, who was beside him, had narrowed.</p><br/><p>I think they understood the true meaning of my words.</p><br/><p>\u201cUntil now, I have been having an idealistic view about merchanting, and\u2026I have pushed through things with brute strength. But I am already in a phase where I can\u2019t keep my eyes away. That\u2019s how I felt.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Raidou-dono has been able to bring about the best possible result in that way. There\u2019s rarely any merchant who would be able to only look at his customers and be able to achieve as much as you walking such a path.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Raidou-sama. You have expanded your business in a way that other people wouldn\u2019t be able to and obtained the satisfaction of your customers. And even now, you are receiving direct calls from countries, and reached a level where your name has been remembered. This is something to be proud of.\u201d (Morris)</p><br/><p>Morris-san and Rembrandt-san gave consolation words towards my self-depreciating confession.</p><br/><p>It is certainly true that my name has been remembered in other countries, and, I can\u2019t say it but, I also have connections with the demon race.</p><br/><p>Somehow, my life as a merchant is going well.</p><br/><p>But that\u2019s merely somehow.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am not thinking about changing the foundation of my methods. I simply want my company to become one that\u2019s able to deal with conflicts not by coincidence, but by predicting and overcoming them. And I think I can\u2019t continue averting my eyes from the evil of other people, even if only a bit.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Look at reality, and learn more about the dirtiness of people that I have been trying not to see before but ended up seeing.</p><br/><p>As a result, I might end up seeing not only hyumans but demi-humans in a dirtier manner as well.</p><br/><p>In order to change the impression the companies, merchants, and nobles have of me, I can\u2019t continue relying on Tomoe and the others for everything.</p><br/><p>If I -their representative- continue like this, the company will simply be seen as a company that can\u2019t be crushed.</p><br/><p>In order to make people think that the very notion of touching Kuzunoha Company is a taboo, I as the representative am the bottleneck that is making it unable to realize this notion.</p><br/><p>I have to throw away this naivety of mine.</p><br/><p>How many times I have thought of doing this.</p><br/><p>But finally\u2026I have understood what I have to do to make this possible.</p><br/><p>This time for sure, I will do it.</p><br/><p>It was\u2026naive of me, trying to avert my eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026And so, you wanted me to teach you about the darkness that I have been carrying inside of me as a merchant, right?\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are times when knowing leads to regret. I am certain that Raidou-dono is able to push away all those people that have petty emotions of defeat, and continue moving forward as you do, but\u2026even so, you still want to learn? Even though you have fulfilled an important condition to make it possible for you to abandon thoughts and simply advance in an idealistic manner?\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Yes. It is not only limited in my merchant life, but also in my life in general. This isn\u2019t something I can continue running away from.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s you, it is possible\u2026 But well, Raidou-dono has decided this himself, so it isn\u2019t something that others can just interject in huh.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>Rembrandt-san does a short sigh and shuts his mouth.</p><br/><p>I also have no choice but to wait for his answer.</p><br/><p>Rembrandt-san was pondering with his eyes closed, and when he nods, he opens his eyes and looks at Morris-san.</p><br/><p>Morris-san quietly nods.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Understood. I will teach you what I can, about the thoughts that overflow in society, and its foundation. Whether it is good luck or bad luck, there\u2019s a mountain of teaching materials regarding that in Tsige. However, this is a personal request of mine, Raidou-dono: Please continue your approach towards your customers as always.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Rembrandt-san, thank you very much!\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut to think that Raidou-dono would say himself that he would want to become a normal merchant, I wouldn\u2019t have expected it.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>In an instant, Rembrandt-san returned to his gentle expression, and strength left his body as he laughs.</p><br/><p>\u201cI-Is that so.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cEven in Rotsgard, you have gained control by brute strength after all. I was getting more and more excited about your future, Raidou-dono. I didn\u2019t expect you to stumble.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201cIn my perspective, I have been stumbling quite a lot though.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>My business in the Academy didn\u2019t give me the impression that it was going better than in Tsige.</p><br/><p>\u201cDifferent from here, there\u2019s no assurance that the Guild will take your side after all.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. Compared to Tsige, I felt like forming connections with the Guild and the merchants was more difficult.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>Rembrandt-san let out a laugh that felt had a hidden meaning.</p><br/><p>Morris-san also had the same expression as he nodded several times.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, and so, what is the business Rembrandt-san had? I still haven\u2019t heard it.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I felt slightly uncomfortable, so I changed the topic.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing big, Compared to the resolve of Raidou-dono, this is but a small matter.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>Maintaining his pleased expression, he placed his elbows on the table and linked his arms on top of his mouth. Gendo_ikari_(Rebuild).png</p><br/><p>Those gestures of his that felt like an act, had intensity.</p><br/><p>I silently waited for his next words.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere will be a revolution occurring soon in this country. I was going to consult you regarding that.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201cHah? Revolution?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Eh?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

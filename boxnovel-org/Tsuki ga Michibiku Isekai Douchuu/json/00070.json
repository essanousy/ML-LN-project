A POV of Tomoki!</p><br/><p>I have never felt this dirty before. Good thing it is a short chapter.</p><br/><p>Btw, thank you for the kind donations up until now. They really motivate me a lot! ^^</p><br/><p>While flying through the sky throwing shining lights out of his godly spear at the demon race and burning them off, the empire\u2019s hero, Iwahashi Tomoki, was in a state of confusion.</p><br/><p>Literally the moment when the gate opened and were in the phase where they would assault the fortress and take the head of the general\u2026</p><br/><p>The people in the surroundings disappeared.</p><br/><p>When looking below, there was a crazy big black hole. People, weapons, a part of the demons as well. Having a dispersed look as if seeing a CG, people were being sucked up by that hades.</p><br/><p>The hostility that was being directed to him. From the opened gate, Tomoki noticed the magic shot and he used a destruction light from his godly spear to disperse them all. At the same time, he remembers something important.</p><br/><p>About his comrades.</p><br/><p>Ginebia, Mora, Yukinatsu.</p><br/><p>The comrades that fought alongside him and protected him.</p><br/><p>Tomoki activates a necklace-shaped sorcerer tool and searches the surroundings. He soon finds a reaction of the three.</p><br/><p>Because of the silver boots the Goddess provided him he was able to float in the air without using magic power, so he was able to invalidate that crazy trap, but his comrades were standing in the ground normally.</p><br/><p>Because of that he was the first target of the attacks, but with all the overwhelming equipment that was clad in his body, it was nothing.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you fall you three?!\u201d (Tomoki)</p><br/><p>Saying that, Tomoki pursues the reaction. The reaction of the three was a bit below. Thankfully, it was practically on the same place they were.</p><br/><p>When he reaches them, they were all gathered up in one place and floating. But that spell may have been incomplete, they seem to be slowly lowering.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are slow Tomoki! The replica of the silver boots is not complete so if there is something heavy we will fall!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOi Yukinatsu, are you referring to me? I can\u2019t just let that slip by\u201d</p><br/><p>Ginebia, who is wearing a plate mail and is clearly the heaviest of them all, lifts an eyebrow and reproaches her comrade\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fight. The two of you are heavier than me after all!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201cOf course we are!\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>A third voice rings into the conversation that seemed like it would transform into a dispute and the two answer with the same words. Compared to the chibi girl Mora, the difference in height was clear.</p><br/><p>Thanks to the creation of Yukinatsu, who came from an alchemist linage, the three somehow were able to save themselves. Tomoki also strokes his chest in relief.</p><br/><p>The exchange between the three also helped as an ingredient to calm down.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am glad that you guys are fine\u201d (Tomoki)</p><br/><p>\u201cTomoki\u2026 I am your shield. I won\u2019t die without protecting you\u201d (Ginebia)</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t frankly make that kind of face, so embarrassing\u201d (Yukinatsu)</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are totally fine!\u201d (Mora)</p><br/><p>Because of the heartfelt words of worry from him, the three appeal their wellbeing with blushed faces.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a grand way they got us with, how cocky for a mid-boss. Mora, call Nagi please. For now we will retreat. Without confirming the situation we can\u2019t decide to continue the battle\u201d (Tomoki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 You are right. Just how many soldiers did we lose here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat an absurd trap. The one who made it is crazy in the head\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood, I will call Nagi\u201d (Mora)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I am counting on you. There will probably be quite the amount of attacks coming from above anytime soon. Ginebia and I will block every single one of them, you can do it right?\u201d (Tomoki)</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. I won\u2019t let you nor Nagi receive a single wound. Don\u2019t underestimate a royal guard\u201d (Ginebia)</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks, Ginebia\u201d (Tomoki)</p><br/><p>Mora continues chanting an aria at her jewel, and while in the middle of giving his thanks to Ginebia, below the party that was slowly falling, a dragon was summoned. A type of flying dragon that possesses giant wings. It\u2019s Nagi, who Mora controls.</p><br/><p>Its emerald green scales are beautiful, a medium class dragon. It is also one of the individuals that are the closest to Mora.</p><br/><p>\u201cNagi, go up! When we reach on top of the hole, we are going to retreat to the back. Please!\u201d (Mora)</p><br/><p>\u201cGYAU\u201d (Nagi :v)</p><br/><p>On top of the dragon, while deflecting the attacks that rain, Tomoki reaches in front of the gate.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat in the world, even the road at the back has become a hole. The rear guard is really the only part remaining\u201d (Tomoki)</p><br/><p>\u201cTomoki, let\u2019s try to save as many people as possible by having them ride Nagi\u201d (Ginebia)</p><br/><p>Ginebia suggests. If they create a barrier around so the people don\u2019t get blown away, the space Nagi has to carry people is still quite enough. These were words that had taken into consideration this fact.</p><br/><p>\u201cGinebia, that is no good. First we have to return as fast as possible and report this to Lily. That is the highest priority\u201d (Tomoki)</p><br/><p>Tomoki rejects Ginebia\u2019s suggestion. For him, it would just be unnecessary luggage and the mobility would decrease. A result he didn\u2019t desire.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut!!\u201d (Ginebia)</p><br/><p>\u201cFor a while now I haven\u2019t been able to get in contact with Lily. Also, this is war. Because it is war, it is fine to just fight as much as the amount of people that died in order to repay them\u201d (Tomoki)</p><br/><p>\u201cTomoki\u2026 I am sorry. I became emotional\u201d (Ginebia)</p><br/><p>Just like how they have done until now, Tomoki\u2019s words enter Ginebia\u2019s heart and body as if permeating her. She was able to accept his words\u2019 logic quite naturally.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mind, it is fine if the usual Ginebia has returned. Now then, let\u2019s go back!\u201d (Tomoki)</p><br/><p>\u201cWait Tomoki\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it Yukinatsu?\u201d (Tomoki)</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it fine to not look for the hero of Limia and the others?\u201d (Yukinatsu)</p><br/><p>Even in a battlefield that has fallen into chaos, is it fine to not confirm the safety of one of the two figureheads? Is what Yukinatsu tries to ask.</p><br/><p>Even if she is a hero, in a situation like this, it is not definite that she was able to deal with it calmly. No matter if retreating is the priority, it is not strange to ask about the Limia hero.</p><br/><p>\u201cHibiki huh. She is also a hero. She must have managed something by herself. Me being worried about her may actually turn into being rude to her. It seems she is a \u201cSenior Onee-san\u201d after all\u201d (Tomoki)</p><br/><p>Just because the said person isn\u2019t there, Tomoki calls the other hero, who he was calling with \u2013san a few moments back, without any suffix.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. If Tomoki has something planned then it\u2019s fine. Let\u2019s go\u201d (Yukinatsu)</p><br/><p>\u201cYosh, Mora I\u2019m counting on you\u201d (Tomoki)</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay! Nagi, do it!\u201d (Mora)</p><br/><p>\u201cNice. But since we went through all the trouble of coming here\u2026\u201d (Tomoki)</p><br/><p>Tomoki turns to the opposite direction of Nagi\u2019s orientation, in short, he faces the fortress. What he prepares is his favorite God Spear. The cone-shaped riding spear is enveloped by light and, in time, everything shines.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is payback!\u201d (Tomoki)</p><br/><p>Determining his aim, Tomoki releases the power of his spear at the gate that was trying to close. The light that straightforwardly travelled enters a gap in the closing gate\u2026 and created a thunderous roar.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuite the aim there\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026 Sniper!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOnii-chan, nice~!\u201d</p><br/><p>To the ovations of the three, Tomoki makes a \u201cthis much is easy\u201d face. Just in case, he uses the necklace to check the surroundings.</p><br/><p>\u201cOtto. It seems the Limia Hero and the others are alright. They are over there\u201d (Tomoki)</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. Heh~ you are right. Maybe I should make a replica of that necklace next. That is pretty convenient\u201d (Yukinatsu)</p><br/><p>Yukinatsu, a bit slower, uses something resembling a binocular to confirm Limia\u2019s party. Knowing that Tomoki used the sorcerer tool to search the area, Yukinatsu showed the greed of a researcher. Prove that she was now a bit more composed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt a later time okay?\u201d (Tomoki)</p><br/><p>Feeling a bit of discomfort in being a guinea pig of Yukinatsu, Tomoki responds in a vague way. To make a replica there is a need to have the sorcerer tool activated and observed for long periods of time. That time is quite a pain for him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are still unable to contact Lily-sama?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ginebia asks. It is natural for her to be worried about the wellbeing of her other master.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I may be repeating myself but, does this world have the so called jamming?\u201d (Tomoki)</p><br/><p>The latter half Tomoki whispers it as if talking to himself. While they were flying, they catch up with Hibiki and the others. As expected of someone riding a dragon, even though Hibiki and the others were the first ones to escape, Tomoki\u2019s side was faster.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat to see you are safe Hibiki-san. Your side\u2019s movements are a bit dull, did something happen?\u201d (Tomoki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Is your detection ability low? It is the long awaited demon general\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Thinking that Hibiki and the others just didn\u2019t have enough strength to use the transmission, Tomoki points out their dull movements, but his face stiffens at her response.</p><br/><p>Instead of the cold tone of voice of Hibiki, Tomoki shows shock at the words demon general.</p><br/><p>\u201cDemon general you say?! At our back?!\u201d (Tomoki)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Moreover, he politely said he will wait for us to reform. Words you wouldn\u2019t expect from someone who set such a trap. And so we are in the middle of having the rear guard fall back as fast as possible. Understood?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>As fast as possible. Hibiki returns a begrudging tone at the insensible words of Tomoki.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way, just how\u2026\u201d (Tomoki)</p><br/><p>\u201cWho knows? They must have used a hand we don\u2019t know yet. By the way, more than the demon general, it is the fact that I can\u2019t get in contact with the troops that are supposed to be at the rear at all. Incredible huh, it seems the demon race is able to obstruct our transmissions. Meaning, there is a chance the demon race can intercept thought transmission. How unpleasant\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cJamming and\u2026 information leak. Isn\u2019t that fatal?\u201d (Tomoki)</p><br/><p>Tomoki seems to have understood the situation. He spews out gloomy words.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd? What will you guys do?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, you say\u2026 about what?\u201d (Tomoki)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we encounter the demon general it will be a joint front, or at least that\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to go right?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Up to this day, this is a first. Or more like, this is the first time Hibiki has smiled at Tomoki from the bottom of her heart .</p><br/><p>\u201cThe situation is different isn\u2019t it?! This should be the setting where we cut up the enemy encampment as fast as possible and escape right?! If we continue the battle like this, we will head straight to the bad end!\u201d (Tomoki)</p><br/><p>\u201cSetting\u2026 setting huh. If that\u2019s the case, you guys escape. I will believe that the unit at the rear will do a pincer attack with us and defeat him. Well, if we were able to contact each other we would be able to cooperate in the escape though. In terms of strategy this is totally our loss. To be honest, I have taken an interest in that demon general\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>In these kind of scenario, Hibiki feels a conclusive gap in Tomoki who was talking as if he were in a dream or illusion. Hibiki feels a part of her is looking at him in a cold way.</p><br/><p>And in a part she is happily talking as if having fun. Tomoki also shows puzzled eyes as if looking at such a living being for the first time.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 are you an idiot?\u201d (Tomoki)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way. Also, I didn\u2019t ask you to cooperate right? In any case, you and I have bad compatibility. The selling point of you guys is the mid-range fire power. Most of my party is close quarter. Your side shows best performance when fighting against big numbers, our side when we fight against fewer. Even if we fight the same opponent, I think our steps would be different\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>(Also, the attitude)</p><br/><p>Hibiki secretly adds.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn short, you are saying we can\u2019t form a joint front?\u201d (Tomoki)</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying there is no point in doing so in this case. I just don\u2019t see the merit of uniting. I don\u2019t like being shot by my allies\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Then, it is fine right?\u201d (Tomoki)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Just, lead the troops and use that fire power to clean up as many enemies over there. If you do that, it will make it possible for more surviving units to escape. We will take the opened path and attract the big-shot. Role division. Let\u2019s go with that in this case\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood. If you say that much, make sure to nail the demon general okay?\u201d (Tomoki)</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>The conversation with the two heroes finishes.</p><br/><p>A slight meeting takes place in both parties.</p><br/><p>Numerous times, voices of objections sound.</p><br/><p>And those grew lower in time. Both sides show will and determination.</p><br/><p>The time the two armies clash once more\u2026 is close.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

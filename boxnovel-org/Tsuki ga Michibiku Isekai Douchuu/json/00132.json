That\u2019s not the case.</p><br/><p>In that town there\u2019s probably no one who would want to be glared by Rembrandt-san, so that discretion served as a help for me.</p><br/><p>The business there went well, so I went and misunderstood that I was beginning to get used to doing business.</p><br/><p>In the middle of it, I was totally made a fool of.</p><br/><p>He wanted Rembrandt-san to owe him, so he told me that he would overlook me if I just leave the town.</p><br/><p>That really got me.</p><br/><p>Just remembering that makes my anger well up. My anger of him, the anger that comes from my own worthlessness; they well up and mix.</p><br/><p>That representative was a person that gave the impression as if gold is supremacy. That\u2019s the kind of sense of value he seemed to live with.</p><br/><p>Looking at how hard it was to deal with him and the things he said, Rembrandt-san might have been like that before his family fell ill.</p><br/><p>Because if he is able to go against that representative in higher than even grounds, I don\u2019t think he would say any soft things.</p><br/><p>It is mortifying, but it is true that I am not fit as a merchant.</p><br/><p>I understand what he said.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s true that I was na\u00efve.</p><br/><p>In the end, I am running away and making a connection with the demon race.</p><br/><p>In the worst case, not only the one here but the store in Tsige as well, and the relationships formed at that town, everything will be\u2026</p><br/><p>No matter if Rembrandt-san said all that to me, I will be going to a camp that\u2019s going against hyumans and having troubles with the Goddess. I can\u2019t burden him.</p><br/><p>I will be secluding in the country that my mom and dad were huh.</p><br/><p>I even came to a parallel world. What am I doing?</p><br/><p>In the tournament grounds that is crowded and giving off heat, I sit in the seat that I had reserved, and look at the stage where no one is in.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s only the finals left in the team battles of the tournament.</p><br/><p>The match of the students I might not be able to meet anymore. I have to properly watch over it.</p><br/><p>They safely won through the semifinals.</p><br/><p>The obvious pestering that was the level limit didn\u2019t have that much effect on them it seems.</p><br/><p>They must have gotten used to the mock battles with the mist lizard where they had to fight by using teamwork.</p><br/><p>Just that, there\u2019s something bothering me.</p><br/><p>The second son of Hopelace.</p><br/><p>His state in the semifinals wasn\u2019t normal.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026 doesn\u2019t give a good feeling. Tomoe, can you tell?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout that noble? Fumu\u2026 he is probably using some kind of magic or drug to increase his power, and that\u2019s its side effect, maybe?\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think Mio?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt gave an unsavory feeling. Like some sort of hyuman mixed with something else. I can see a disgusting tint\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cLike a demi-human?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. How to say it? Uhm, hyuman and demi-humans are of different types, but it is like having two of the same bread tied together, and the disgusting feeling would be embedded inside it. Like a pound cake with dry fruits inside?\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>I kind of get it and kind of not.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, see\u2026\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I hold an opinion similar to that of Tomoe.</p><br/><p>A hollow atmosphere as if he lost his sanity.</p><br/><p>Crush his opponents with abnormal brute strength. But instead of calling it hyuman, it is more like a mamono.</p><br/><p>The surrounding members were not as serious as him, but I can\u2019t think of them as normal either.</p><br/><p>In this tournament it is prohibited to use magic drugs, so I don\u2019t think it is medicine but\u2026 in that case, maybe magic?</p><br/><p>Well, even if their strength gets higher, from what I have seen, it is lower than Zwei-san.</p><br/><p>In technique, there\u2019s no need to mention. Lower than blue lizard.</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s with three, my students will win.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why there\u2019s no need to worry that much but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cShiki, I was thinking you would be coming back anytime now. How is their condition?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cWaka-sama, they have been doing an intense battle of rock, paper, scissors for the rights of participating\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cFufu, glad to see they are not tense\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Shiki had returned from looking after the students.</p><br/><p>He answered my question with no hesitation, and told me about the students\u2019 condition.</p><br/><p>\u201cShiki, what did you think about that Hopelace boy? He gives out quite a different atmosphere compared to the individual battles\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Yeah. I can\u2019t say anything definite, but I think he is being done something\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cBeing done?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. He is losing his sanity. I think that\u2019s a type of magic drug. It resembles something I have handled a long time ago\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>Medicine huh.</p><br/><p>So he really can make anything valid.</p><br/><p>I feel like I kind of understand how it is to get into trouble with a noble.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a magic drug that turns hyumans into ghouls. Changing them into a half-dead state, and enslaving them. Well, it would have been okay to make it have an immediate effect, but it turned out as a frail article that couldn\u2019t be used and ended up as a failure\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>I can easily get Shiki to talk about his past deeds, but the amount of pitch black content is not low.</p><br/><p>This is one of many.</p><br/><p>He does pretty frightening stuff.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnslaving huh. It at least doesn\u2019t seem like he is being controlled, and doesn\u2019t look frail either\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Even when predicting the highest battle power he could get, in the worst case, there won\u2019t be problems if we stop it. I have told the students to retire if it turns dangerous. Rather, I am-\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>I cut into the words of Shiki.</p><br/><p>\u201cShiki\u2026 you told them that?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I did though?\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh~, if you tell them that, they would definitely do something rash. Amelia being the first in the list\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Even if it is not her, the others will probably go with the enthusiasm of \u2018I will win\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose were words brought out of concern though\u2026\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the worst case, it is fine to stop them even if it turns into a defeat. And so, Shiki, what were you trying to say before?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, about Hopelace. The necklace he was using before equipping his armor piqued my interest\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cNecklace? That guy, he still had more things he brought from his house?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was disguised with a magic resistance effect\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>Disguised?</p><br/><p>That\u2019s certainly strange.</p><br/><p>That means there\u2019s a hidden effect.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be, the type that awakens and gives a power-up?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>In times, accessories possess effects that are more dangerous than weapons. Well, that\u2019s gamer logic though. But I only think this way because that guy really doesn\u2019t care about what methods he uses after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cAwaken? No. I think it is some sort of accumulating effect. It didn\u2019t seem like it was in function, and it worried me a bit\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>For Shiki to hesitate, that\u2019s unusual.</p><br/><p>Ah, it\u2019s fine to forget about my game logic explanation there.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt kind of gives a bad presentiment. This whole town is giving a strange feeling\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Mio looks at the sky and says this carefree.</p><br/><p>It seems she sensed something that cannot be considered as a threat to her.</p><br/><p>But in this situation where many things are mobilizing, the words of Mio\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Just in case, can you bring some equipment Jin and the others can use from the store? Leave it in their waiting room. And after you finish doing that, let\u2019s watch together\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood\u201d</p><br/><p>This may be the last thing I will be able to do for Jin and the others.</p><br/><p>Weapons are something that just assist in shaking off problematic things though.</p><br/><p>They are the kids I have been looking after for several months. I have grown attached to a certain extent.</p><br/><p>\u2026 No, quite attached. I was being careful to avoid this from happening, but I was unable to.</p><br/><p>For now, let\u2019s protect them.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry for the wait!! We will be beginning the finals of this tournament\u2019s team battles!!\u201d</p><br/><p>A resonant voice was emitted from the man that came up the stage.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright! Let\u2019s go! You pipsqueaks, don\u2019t go holding back on Hopelace!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am not a pipsqueak! Like hell I would hold back. I can finally try the instant strengthening that Jin was doing, in real combat. If it goes well, it would be no different from going at my full strength\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think that making fun of one\u2019s body growth is childish! I will be stealing all the spotlight!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shoulders, knees, elbows; in those kind of places, they had thick leather protectors equipped, and the three students who were wearing their battle uniform, talked in a cheerful manner.</p><br/><p>The first words the tall boy said really described them well.</p><br/><p>Jin and the pipsqueak combi.</p><br/><p>Saying it that way, it really does fit.</p><br/><p>The other two denied this, but the remaining members that had a gloomy atmosphere around them also thought this way.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did I use rock at that moment?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you didn\u2019t made it a draw there, I would have been able to participate\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUsing paper 4 times in a row, are you a spammer?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t participate in a single match\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The ones who lost in the participation battle.</p><br/><p>In contrast to the three that are exultant and holding weapons, they seemed to be feeling down. And there was one that said something pretty tragic.</p><br/><p>Holding a standard one-handed sword, there\u2019s Jin; possessing a spear the same height as her, its Yuno; and with a barely good gem embedded at the tip of his staff, there\u2019s Izumo.</p><br/><p>These three were the winners.</p><br/><p>The remaining four can\u2019t participate, but they follow until the stage\u2019s vicinity.</p><br/><p>Just like that, Jin and the others go up the stage.</p><br/><p>In front of them, the 7 match opponents were already there.</p><br/><p>\u201cDestroy, destroy, destroy\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOioi, did you use a drug or something today, senpai? That\u2019s just too late\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnsightly\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDisgusting\u201d</p><br/><p>While looking at Jin and the others with eyes devoid of light, Ilumgand Hopelace holds his great sword with both hands.</p><br/><p>Without getting worked up, Jin, Yuno and Izumo stood in a row.</p><br/><p>The introductions of the participants is done in order.</p><br/><p>By nature, just standing in this place is the best situation for the students that attend this academy, but this final was ruled by a strange atmosphere.</p><br/><p>3 versus 7. There\u2019s also that.</p><br/><p>But in the seven, there\u2019s one that\u2019s clearly not normal and being restless; and in the side of three, they show no sign of tension and simply smile.</p><br/><p>And then, the strong gazes of interest from the audience seats and visitor seats that are expecting a match that will surpass the past years.</p><br/><p>\u201cBegin!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The battle situation suddenly unfolded in a vehement manner.</p><br/><p>Yuno and Izumo who were at both sides of Jin, both of them stepped back at their respective sides.</p><br/><p>An abrupt enhanced acceleration. And it was a speed higher than that shown in the individual matches.</p><br/><p>Using the instant enhancement of Jin as the concept, the two of them also learned it in a small space of time.</p><br/><p>Makoto widening his eyes was just the onset.</p><br/><p>And then, the other move\u2026</p><br/><p>Was from Ilumgand.</p><br/><p>Maybe he has some grudge from the individual matches, he went in a straight line towards Jin.</p><br/><p>That speed was slower than Yuno and Izumo, but it is an acceleration with his large body build and his whole body clad in armor and a great sword.</p><br/><p>The intensity was incomparable to the other two.</p><br/><p>Sadly, Jin was not overwhelmed by that at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenpai! This is the last match, prepare!!\u201d (Jin)</p><br/><p>Jin gleefully accepts Ilumgand\u2019s charge.</p><br/><p>Just what he wished.</p><br/><p>The remaining 6 at Ilumgand\u2019s team were being approached by Yuno and Izumo from both sides.</p><br/><p>Jin had no need to worry about them.</p><br/><p>The 4 magicians were already chanting their arias, and the remaining 2 warriors were facing the 2 approaching respectively.</p><br/><p>\u2018How stupid\u2019 is what Jin thought as he bended his mouth into a smile.</p><br/><p>Because that assured him that they weren\u2019t able to read what the two were trying to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe annoying thrash will beeeee crusheeeeed!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Without learning his lesson, Ilumgand unleashes the horizontal swipe that was crushed a few days ago.</p><br/><p>Jin takes on that attack. There was no need to crush it.</p><br/><p>He wanted to show Ilumgand that.</p><br/><p>But he could tell from the sword that was swung with unexpected strength, that the wooden sword clad with magic power, which was supposed to take one hit without problems, was being wedged into. Jin\u2019s body was pushed back.</p><br/><p>\u201cTch!!\u201d (Jin)</p><br/><p>Clicking his tongue, Jin tried to switch the movements of his body and pull his sword to divert the attack.</p><br/><p>In that moment, he was assaulted by another unexpected attack.</p><br/><p>While swinging the great sword just like that, Ilumgand forcibly takes one step, and with his open hand, he tried to punch Jin.</p><br/><p>It was clearly a jumbled attack that is not taking into consideration the burden the body takes.</p><br/><p>An attack that one would even think that it is enhanced.</p><br/><p>By nature, it shouldn\u2019t be an attack that one would receive, but he was thinking about how he would make Ilumgand crawl in defeat. Most of his thought process was directed there.</p><br/><p>It was Jin\u2019s negligence.</p><br/><p>(I can\u2019t dodge it. That bastard) (Jin)</p><br/><p>The fist approaches his face.</p><br/><p>Understanding that it already reached the point of being unavoidable, Jin instinctively brings up the hand that was holding the sword.</p><br/><p>Accurately speaking, his elbow.</p><br/><p>It may not be much, but there\u2019s protectors there.</p><br/><p>That defense miraculously made it in time, and the fist of Ilumgand crashes into Jin\u2019s left elbow.</p><br/><p>Without minding that it crashed into his elbow, the fist continues its momentum.</p><br/><p>Jin was blown slightly to the back and toppled over. But stood up immediately and fixed his stance.</p><br/><p>Not releasing the sword from his hands even with the unexpected shock was as expected of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that how nobles fight? Tch, getting the better of me when sensei is watching\u201d (Jin)</p><br/><p>An intense anger flickers in Jin\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Receiving that attack was mostly because of his own negligence, but in the midst of the battle\u2019s exaltation, those kind of thoughts didn\u2019t enter his mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cYuno, Izumo. Sorry, but I will be beginning first\u201d (Jin)</p><br/><p>Lowly, Jin\u2019s whisper leaks out.</p><br/><p>As if seizing Ilumgand\u2019s second rush, this time, Jin also charged.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

And after that, we confirmed our standings.</p><br/><p>Since then, there hasn\u2019t been a single word about Yaso-Katsui or Kannaoi.</p><br/><p>We simply told her that Sairitz-san has given us her approval by telling us that she would cooperate with her best if we were to make a store inside the country, and that we have obtained information from her and are currently in the country with the objective of heading to the labyrinth.</p><br/><p>\u2026Words have a lot of depth huh.</p><br/><p>The princess-sama said that she is the daughter of a relatively big town\u2019s landlord, and her name is Ousaka Iroha. Because of Tomoe\u2019s first impression, she is pretty attached to her.</p><br/><p>Iroha is probably her real name, but her family name is probably not Ousaka but Osakabe.</p><br/><p>The person herself said: \u2018Osaka\u2014 Ousaka\u2019, and restated it after all.</p><br/><p>However, different from other countries, the names given to the people in Lorel are not names that define their nature, their nature is what defines their name. A name like Iroha-chan finally clicked in my mind. </p><br/><p>Their naming sense is Japanese-like, so I was finally able to confirm that the Wise-sama in this country are definitely Japanese. I have also understood that this country has been influenced in a slightly strange manner.</p><br/><p>The legendary master swordsman Iori is also a totally Japanese-style name after all.</p><br/><p>When I asked, I was told that this person was from such a long past that it is even questionable if he actually existed, but in this country, it is a pretty well known fairytale, or more like, the main protagonist of a hero tale.</p><br/><p>I do think the person existed, and there\u2019s the chance he was the husband of Root.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s also the chance that he was a Japanese person.</p><br/><p>It seems like he is loved, so well, if he really is Japanese, that in itself is something that makes me kind of proud.</p><br/><p>And it seems like Iroha-chan is a big fan of Muramatsu Iori.</p><br/><p>Yeah, how charming.</p><br/><p>But at any rate, the attire this girl has which you can tell by a glance that it is expensive, her speech and conduct that you can tell she is ignorant to the outside world, moreover, even if it is the story of a hero which children would seem to like, her knowledge was pretty detailed.</p><br/><p>She even retorted about the name of Kuzunoha company, saying that: \u2018You are named Kuzunoha, and yet, you are a foreign company?\u2019.</p><br/><p>The two possibilities point to rich people, but rather than the daughter of a landlord, she looks more like a princess for me.</p><br/><p>In other words, she gives me the impression that there\u2019s no doubt she is the daughter of the Osakabe household.</p><br/><p>I will confirm this with Tomoe later.</p><br/><p>It seems like the interest of Iroha-chan finally shifted to something else.</p><br/><p>By the way, even when I said that I am the master of Tomoe and am the representative of the company, not only did she hold her stomach in laughter, she was told by Tomoe that it was the truth and got shocked.</p><br/><p>Leaving aside how much a kid can understand, we explained it to her, and received the impression: \u2018how mysterious\u2019.</p><br/><p>Those are the details from just a few moments ago.</p><br/><p>Right now, the other thing that Iroha-chan is interested in -no, it is not me- that\u2019s right, she was interested in the talk about entering the open air bath.</p><br/><p>Going to the bath with a girl I met just moments ago.</p><br/><p>The development of the situation is so bad that it sounds like a bad eroge, and I can also clearly tell that it will go straight to a Bad End right after.</p><br/><p>I am going straight to jail.</p><br/><p>1454366155_giphy 123123</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know about this world, but ethically speaking, this would put me straight in jail.</p><br/><p>No matter if I have the promissory note of Sairitz-san.</p><br/><p>But I threw that line of thought immediately into the far horizon, and well, she is a guest that we brought ourselves, so I told Iroha-chan to go take a bath first instead.</p><br/><p>It is not a bath that has water filled up, it is a luxurious hot spring that has water constantly flowing in it.</p><br/><p>It is obviously smaller than the super bath-house that came out from a big hole at a winter mountain and had its construction rushed, but in the eyes of a plebeian like me, it is an open air bath of pretty big size.</p><br/><p>\u2026Now that I think about it, we are staying in a pretty luxurious inn where there\u2019s a time limit of a one hour stay and any more than that we have to pay extra charges, and yet, we are able to stay in this kind of room as much as we want.</p><br/><p>And we are able to utilize the guest room in the inn without any sort of time limitation.</p><br/><p>I\u2026have a lot of money huh.</p><br/><p>The gold in the warehouse at Asora gradually increases.</p><br/><p>Even if we were to continue building warehouses, the insides wouldn\u2019t change, and more importantly, it doesn\u2019t look good for the scenery, so we are trying to exchange the gold coins in Asora\u2019s warehouses.</p><br/><p>If I remember correctly, there\u2019s the magic silver coin and the yellow gold coin (which is also called magic gold coin), so it is possible to exchange it, but leaving aside the fact that there\u2019s two that are higher than the gold coin, they are not easy to use.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t want to exchange it much.</p><br/><p>But there\u2019s a lot of things I want to place inside the warehouses, so it can\u2019t be helped.</p><br/><p>Frankly speaking, the yellow gold coin is difficult to obtain, and it is half treated as an artistic good. If I had to illustrate it with something in Earth, it would be like an expensive commemoration coin, so I have changed them all into magic silver coins.</p><br/><p>I remember that even with that, Shiki said that it would still take the space of several warehouses.</p><br/><p>It is impossible to know the exact amount of money we have, and there\u2019s no way to have a good grasp of it, but\u2026let\u2019s try asking about the amount of money we have in our possession.</p><br/><p>Oh right.</p><br/><p>At any rate, I offered Iroha-chan to take a bath, but she said that she can\u2019t go on her own, so someone should enter with her.</p><br/><p>And after that, she slowly went to the front of Mio and lifted both her arms.</p><br/><p>She stretched both arms and legs while standing.</p><br/><p>Mio had a dubious expression as she asked the reason why to Iroha-chan. Well, that\u2019s normal.</p><br/><p>I also don\u2019t understand what she is aiming for.</p><br/><p>But I will tell Mio later to stop calling her little girl.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said your name was Mio, right? Quickly take my clothes off-desu.\u201d (Iroha)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Hah?\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with that \u2018hah\u2019? You are the maid that serves under Tomoe-sama and Raidou-sama, right? It doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s any other servant here, so I will leave you under my care-desu.\u201d (Iroha)</p><br/><p>\u201cPfft.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Tomoe laughed.</p><br/><p>The pure words of Iroha-chan held no malice.</p><br/><p>I see, what a misunderstanding.</p><br/><p>In terms of our standings, the correct answer would be that below me, Tomoe and Mio stand in the same height, but because of the processing of Iroha-chan, even with our explanation, Mio had become the one with the lowest standing among us.</p><br/><p>\u2026Ah, I see.</p><br/><p>On top of that, she was accompanied by that old man and those people that looked like bodyguards, and it seemed like there were servants too, so she probably thought our relationship was similar to how theirs is.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Listen well. I serve Waka-sama! By no means do I serve someone like Tomoe-san. Tomoe-san and I have the same standing. No, I, who has been gradually gaining the favor of Waka-sama\u2019s stomach, am standing higher. Do you understand?\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you are the cook, that means your standing is lower than that of Tomoe-sama who is a close aide. In the first place, having katanas and serving her master is the proof that she is a close aide. That\u2019s why\u2026\u201d (Iroha)</p><br/><p>\u201cDo.you.un.der.stand?\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201c?!!! Iph huphs!! Iph huphs-esu!\u201d (Iroha) </p><br/><p>\u201cAre.you.lis.te.ning?\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Mio immediately abandons any thoughts of conversation and goes straight to force.</p><br/><p>The cheeks of Iroha-chan\u2026that looks painful.</p><br/><p>Since the meat has not been teared off, it seems like she properly understands how much strength to use on a child.</p><br/><p>Hm, for someone like Mio, this is quite the soft and Mio-like way of dealing with things.</p><br/><p>After a while of lifting her up and doing the dance of \u2018un.der.stand?\u2019, Iroha-chan tearfully nodded her head up and down.</p><br/><p>The convincing was successful.</p><br/><p>Or more like, con.vin.cing.</p><br/><p>\u201cUwuuu, if Mio-san is no good, it can\u2019t be helped. Raidou-sama, I ask of you-desu.\u201d (Iroha)</p><br/><p>Eh?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this little girl saying? Does she have a loose screw?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d (Iroha)</p><br/><p>Crap, I messed up.</p><br/><p>My words and thoughts come out in reverse order.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh no well, I haven\u2019t assisted a girl in her bathing you see. I am sorry but, I can\u2019t.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>In a variety of meanings, that is.</p><br/><p>I have no such tastes.</p><br/><p>It doesn\u2019t excite me at all.</p><br/><p>Today is a day where I have experienced a lot of unexpected findings.</p><br/><p>Or more like, why is it that when Mio is no good, she asks me rather than Tomoe?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou litt\u2014lass. Your name was Iroha, right? It seems like my words were not enough.\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Mio spins both hands and looks at Iroha-chan.</p><br/><p>Iroha-chan is definitely not saying this to seduce me, so don\u2019t just turn the little girl into lass and call her by her name, Mio.</p><br/><p>It seems like spinning both her hands had great effect on Iroha-chan, she hid behind my back.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow now Mio, can\u2019t you see that Iroha is getting scared? From what we have heard, this girl\u2019s family is that of a pretty influential landlord. She grew in an environment where her necessities were all taken care by others. Don\u2019t get so angry.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cTomoe-san, are you telling me to let this girl have Waka-sama take off her clothes, and assist her in her bathing? Have Waka-sama wash her body and hair, and soak in the bath together? Is that what you are saying? I see. Can\u2019t let that happen, definitely can\u2019t. There\u2019s no way I would let something so envious\u2014 Anyways, I won\u2019t accept it! No way! Because I will be the one who will be doing it later!\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, if it\u2019s soaking in the bath, I can do it on my own. But taking off my clothes and washing my body and hair, that\u2019s the job of the servants that are in the bath-na no desu. It is the same with my mom as well-desu.\u201d (Iroha)</p><br/><p>Oi.</p><br/><p>You intended to make me wash your body and hair?</p><br/><p>How scary.</p><br/><p>The words that Iroha-chan says, steadily increase the level of how much unawareness this girl has, and how she has been raised in her rich family.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s what they have been doing? Seriously?</p><br/><p>Also Mio, I will end up collapsing again if you do that.</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t I tell you to restrain yourselves not that long ago?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen you say it, it sounds strangely erotic, Mio. But don\u2019t worry, I wouldn\u2019t let Waka do something like that. He hasn\u2019t done that for me either after all. I was the first one that thought about bringing her here-ja. And so, how about I help Iroha in her bathing?\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Aside from the funny words Tomoe muttered around the middle, her words were unexpectedly admirable.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no way I am going to wash the body of Tomoe who is a lot older and surpasses me in height by much.</p><br/><p>Well, let\u2019s have Tomoe bath with Iroha-chan then.</p><br/><p>The person herself is okay with it, and Mio doesn\u2019t want to do it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith T-T-Tomoe-sama-desu ka?! Impossible! It is absolutely impossible-na no desu!!\u201d (Iroha)</p><br/><p>*cling*</p><br/><p>Iroha-chan\u2019s face goes bright red and clings onto me.</p><br/><p>Firmly.</p><br/><p>The expression of Mio went one level up.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t understand how that works, but that\u2019s how I felt.</p><br/><p>But what does this mean, little girl?</p><br/><p>If I had to say something about this, isn\u2019t your attitude reversed in regards to me and Tomoe?</p><br/><p>\u2026Could it be?!</p><br/><p>This girl, has she already reached the age where she has perverted sexual preferences?!</p><br/><p>Impossible, Lorel.</p><br/><p>That is a side of the Japanese that you shouldn\u2019t imitate.</p><br/><p>?!!!</p><br/><p>When I heard about the legendary swordsman Iori, I thought that there was a pupil or an adopted child of Miyamoto Musashi that had a name like that.</p><br/><p>I totally thought that this person was a man, but could it be\u2026it was a woman?!</p><br/><p>N-Now that I think about it, the bodyguards just now were both women.</p><br/><p>In other words\u2026I am correct?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with that reaction-ja? If you are fine with Waka, you should be fine with me as well, right? It seems like you don\u2019t have hesitation in showing your skin at bath after all.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cT-T-T-That\u2019s not the problem here!\u201d (Iroha)</p><br/><p>How could it be.</p><br/><p>People of Lorel Union, I don\u2019t know which Japanese did these, but I am truly sorry.</p><br/><p>The solution of this has not yet been found even with state-of-the-art techniques in the modern world.</p><br/><p>To forcefully fix this, you would need to do things like brainwashing, and that doesn\u2019t feel like it is a solution.</p><br/><p>(Ah, Waka, just saying but, this girl likes boys, you know. It seems like she hasn\u2019t met him yet, but she has a fiancee that she herself has accepted.) (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Receiving a shocking revelation, I was filled with apologetic feelings towards Lorel. I don\u2019t know how Tomoe knew what I was thinking, but she send me a lukewarm thought transmission.</p><br/><p>Iroha-chan\u2019s speech and conduct are clearly telling me otherwise though.</p><br/><p>Is it really the case?</p><br/><p>It is Tomoe, so it shouldn\u2019t be a mistake, but\u2026you know\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cFumu, then what\u2019s the problem-ja.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cHa\u2026ha ha ha.\u201d (Iroha)</p><br/><p>She looked like a dog with rough breathing.</p><br/><p>It seems like she is trying to say the reason, so we just wait.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is embarrassing-desu!\u201d (Iroha)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo well, we will be bathing together anyways, right?\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease give up!\u201d (Iroha) </p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Isn\u2019t it please give in?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Ah, I retorted by reflex.</p><br/><p>\u201cAw, please give in!-na no desu.\u201d</p><br/><p>She is really agitated.</p><br/><p>Let just have her say everything she has to say for now.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t retort, don\u2019t retort.</p><br/><p>\u201cUmu.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Looks like Tomoe is doing that too.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt least wait until I am 17-18, and get a woman-like body like that of my mom. At that time\u2026I will happily take a bath together. Right now it is no good-na no desu! I can\u2019t show you this petite body of mine!! It can\u2019t match Tomoe-sama\u2019s incredible body at all!!\u201d (Iroha)</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know how old this girl is but, is it that? The talk about taking a bath together after several years later.</p><br/><p>Even if Mio were to take off Iroha-chan\u2019s clothes, it would still end up in them taking a bath together after all.</p><br/><p>So should they take baths separately?</p><br/><p>But even so, her naked body would still be seen already anyways.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really care about the naked body of a child. Also, if your goal is to have a body like that of your mother, you will in time look similar to her. Don\u2019t mind it. Well, if Iroha says that she definitely doesn\u2019t want me to see, then I don\u2019t mind going in the bath with a blindfold.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u2026I wouldn\u2019t like that.</p><br/><p>A bath is something more free, willful, and fun.</p><br/><p>In my land, it is called a necessary article to cleanse your heart after all.</p><br/><p>I am one of the people that say: Bath is life.</p><br/><p>But I still haven\u2019t mastered the bath road enough to say these words though.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething like a blindfold is just\u2026!\u201d (Iroha)</p><br/><p>Even Iroha-chan is not so lacking in common sense.</p><br/><p>It looks like she understands the importance of bathing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what should we do? Even if it is slightly embarrassing, it is best to obediently let me wash you, you know. It is my first time cleaning the body of someone else after all. Be proud, I am giving you the honor of being my first.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>This Tomoe.</p><br/><p>She must have read something in the memories of Iroha-chan and her group.</p><br/><p>She seems to be in a pretty good mood, and she is even saying this much, so\u2026it must be quite the thing.</p><br/><p>Could it be, this girl has something special?</p><br/><p>I feel like that \u2018special\u2019 something is directed at me and not at Tomoe.</p><br/><p>\u201cI ask that T-Tomoe-sama goes in first, or that you go in later-desu!\u201d (Iroha)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What?\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Pfft.\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>It has curved.</p><br/><p>Now Mio is the one who leaks a laugh.</p><br/><p>In other words, there were two patterns in the head of Iroha-chan that could be taken after being rejected by Mio and asked me to look after her.</p><br/><p>The first is for Mio and Iroha-chan to go together; Tomoe baths alone.</p><br/><p>The other one is me going together with Iroha-chan; Tomoe and Mio go in together.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026In short, Iroha, you are telling me to go in alone?\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! I am just saying that you can happily enter together with Mio-san-no desu!\u201d (Iroha)</p><br/><p>Maybe she was pushed by the strange vigour of Tomoe, Iroha-chan began speaking formally with her -desus.</p><br/><p>-Desus really are unrivalled.</p><br/><p>Maybe it is restricted to little girls, but strangely, I feel like forgiving it.</p><br/><p>But it seems like I am the only one that\u2019s forgiving here.</p><br/><p>Looks like the other two didn\u2019t agree at all with what she said.</p><br/><p>Even I could tell that the time for questions and answers was over.</p><br/><p>Tomoe and Mio silently nod.</p><br/><p>Well, I may not be fit to say it, but I think it is the proper decision.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t let the little girl enter alone, and don\u2019t let me bath together with a girl that I have just met.</p><br/><p>Then tonight, I will restrain from bathing, and have Mio or Tomoe enter the bath with Iroha-chan.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s the best choice.</p><br/><p>\u201cIroha, if you had just accepted the blindfold, there would have still been room for negotiation. Now that I think about it, we might have been spoiling you by considering standings.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Hm?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe very thought of showing consideration towards this lass was a mistake. Because, from the beginning, this was what we have been looking forward to the most in all the day!\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Hm? This\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHiiih?!\u201d (Iroha)</p><br/><p>\u201cThere we go.\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Iroha-chan was pried away from my thigh by Mio.</p><br/><p>It happened in an instant.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a good opportunity-ja. I will teach you how to enter the bath. That\u2019s right, the etiquette of mixed bathing, that is!\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>There\u2019s nothing like that!</p><br/><p>Of course, there\u2019s no good opportunity for that either!</p><br/><p>That\u2019s the first time I have heard of something like this!</p><br/><p>\u201cHey Tomoe, why are you grabbing my back collar?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, because this is the thing we have been looking forward to the most all day after all! Here we go Waka, prepare yourself!\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, you!\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you say that today you are not going to bath! We won\u2019t allow that. That\u2019s right, we won\u2019t!\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou read it! You have read my mind again!\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t even need to read it. There\u2019s a limit to how transparent you are!\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>I was dragged into the dressing room that\u2019s right before the open air bath.</p><br/><p>B-Baths are more about freedom and willfulness. Uuuh.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so, Iroha, I will be peeling you off right now, but do you want me to wear a blindfold? Hm?\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you do something like that, if it us, we would still be able to see if we wanted to anyways so, isn\u2019t that pointless? It seems like this lass is wearing something troublesome to take off, so I will just help her take it off quickly-desu wa.\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>The bath will end as fast as taking off our clothes, right?</p><br/><p>\u2026No wait, you still can see?</p><br/><p>What\u2019s with that?</p><br/><p>Are blindfolds only fashion for you guys?</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Mio! You idiot! If you didn\u2019t say anything, we could have just told Waka that we would be wearing blindfolds, and we would have been able to wash him twice or thrice, you know!!\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201c?!!! What?!! What\u2019s with that reward?! Blindfold, where is the blindfold?! Ah, there\u2019s none! Wait for a bit, I will borrow one from the Gorgons!\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026No well, I have already heard it. Or more like, I thought it was only to the extent that you are able to tell by the presence, but you two are actually able to see huh. I don\u2019t know if this information will be useful, but\u2026I will keep it in mind.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have crushed one important card.

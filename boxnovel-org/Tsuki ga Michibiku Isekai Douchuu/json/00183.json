(Late)</p><br/><p>This is the first sponsored chapter, and you know what that means, there\u2019s another chapter coming after!</p><br/><p>I was actually planning on bringing them out sooner, but with all the events going on, it was pretty hard. And the chapters being extra long didn\u2019t help at all.</p><br/><p>Anyways, I still need to edit the next chapter but do expect it!</p><br/><p>Thanks for the donations and keep commenting everyone. For me, the best part of translating is not the story but the comments that come after!</p><br/><p>This is something i have thought in the White Sand Sea as well but, it seems this world still has a lot more mysterious places.</p><br/><p>As expected of a fantasy world.</p><br/><p>Being received by Io and Rona, we journeyed together with them for several days.</p><br/><p>There would be a blizzard first thing in the morning, but a one-time per day cycle was normal. The attacks of mamonos were splendidly dealt with by the demons.</p><br/><p>The mamonos that came out had the same lineup as the mamonos in Kaleneon, so I was contemplating taking them as reference to learn the methods of dealing with it.</p><br/><p>What surprised me was the second day at noon.</p><br/><p>It was still noon, and yet, when I thought it had become dark, the sky became black in one breath.</p><br/><p>By the time we advanced for 1 short hour, it was already night.</p><br/><p>The ground had changed into ice at several locations, and it felt as if we were brushing the surface. The blizzard had strengthened, and it made me think that this is a place that hyumans wouldn\u2019t be able to live in at all.</p><br/><p>But maybe in this place this was a common occurrence, the demon side didn\u2019t show any panic, and created a barrier against cold just like they did at the first day as they continued their lively advance.</p><br/><p>How fearsome is the northern country.</p><br/><p>In the end, we advanced through a blizzard in what could be considered an everlasting darkness. A pretty rare to get experience.</p><br/><p>At the third day\u2026morning doesn\u2019t come.</p><br/><p>Since 5 in the afternoon of the second day, it has been night all the time.</p><br/><p>Do places exist where the sun doesn\u2019t come out? If that\u2019s the case, no wonder it is so cold.</p><br/><p>At this day, the demon race showed a slightly panicked state.</p><br/><p>A type of mamono. If it were only that, it wouldn\u2019t be that out of ordinary though. It seems that the level of the enemy was higher than they thought.</p><br/><p>A big-framed lion with quite the intensity. Its body hair is pure white.</p><br/><p>I have not heard reports of its sighting in Kaleneon, and this is also my first time seeing it.</p><br/><p>Several lion males(or so I think) with imposing mane attacked us.</p><br/><p>For males to do the hunting is pretty surprising.</p><br/><p>When they jumped at us, I could clearly tell its size.</p><br/><p>The demon soldiers that stepped forward served as a measuring tool.</p><br/><p>As big as a large-sized one box van.</p><br/><p>And it was fast.</p><br/><p>The demon soldiers that were hurriedly trying to fix their formation were crunch to death in an instant. It seems there were people that survived, but the people that had come out to my front were no good.</p><br/><p>They may be people which I have only exchanged light conversations, but it gives me a sad feeling.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know if this will serve as a memorial, but I will at least defeat these guys. When I thought about beginning, Shiki\u2019s hand hit mine.</p><br/><p>When I look at his face, he shook his head to the sides.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know why was that, but I decide to overlook the situation for a bit.</p><br/><p>In the end, Io and Rona also participated in the fight, and the white lions were defeated.</p><br/><p>After that, unexpected things happened multiple times.</p><br/><p>Mamonos that were clearly stronger than the previous ones were appearing frequently, and the soldiers that were accompanying us ended up wounded or dead.</p><br/><p>The barrier for cold has been maintained and the pace hasn\u2019t changed, but this day made me feel as if I were wounded all over.</p><br/><p>Looking back at it, I feel like it wasn\u2019t normal.</p><br/><p>Right now we have finally gotten time for a break, and we were resting at the tent that Shiki had prepared.</p><br/><p>Rona had prepared a tent for us as well, but we turned down the offer.</p><br/><p>We did tell them that we would be bringing the necessary ourselves, but they probably were unsure if we would be able to properly calculate the coldness in these areas. It seems they brought our share as well just in case.</p><br/><p>\u201cShiki, did you foresee that it would be this cold? This tent seems to have an impressive protection against cold.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. The demon race territory is a land of intense cold after all. I made this tent so that it can be spread out immediately, and be able to deal with any type of environment.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a great help. But you know, it seems the demon race did prepare our share too but, was it okay to decline it?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Even if it is of lower quality than this, we will be returning to Asora at night to rest anyways, so wouldn\u2019t it be better to accept their good will?\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Ah, so Mio also held the same opinion as me.</p><br/><p>In that case, it means there\u2019s some sort of problem in it huh.</p><br/><p>I see.</p><br/><p>Is there a chance that being lend things from the demon side will lead to spying on us?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is just that those things were prepared in anticipation that we would be unprepared, also, I don\u2019t want to rely on the things that Rona has prepared.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>As I thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, that talk about Rona was a joke, but thinking about each other\u2019s position in this journey, she wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything weird.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>As I thought, I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>Would it be okay to ask why?</p><br/><p>It kinda makes me hesitate.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy-desu?\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Naizu-desu Mio.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause we are guests they have invited, and Rona has taken the job of a guide by the orders of the Demon Lord. Even if she is like that, Rona is loyal to the Demon Lord, so she wouldn\u2019t do something like abandoning the mission. That\u2019s why, even if we use the tent they have prepared and go back to Asora, there wouldn\u2019t be any problems. Checking the inside of the tent is something that she would definitely not do.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it fine to just do it without getting caught?\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cI am here. She understands that if she were to get caught by me, it would all turn detrimental. And there\u2019s Waka\u2019s power overwatching as well, so that also plays a part.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>Shiki really does know Rona well.</p><br/><p>Instead of close friends, it feels more like a *dog and monkey* relationship though. </p><br/><p>\u201cHah\u2026 what a pain.\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Mio does one sigh.</p><br/><p>For these last few days, she hasn\u2019t been taking any satisfying meal at breakfast and lunch after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, Waka-sama, I am sorry for stopping your hand a while ago.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>He lowered his head.</p><br/><p>It is not really something that requires him to apologize.</p><br/><p>I do want to hear the reason why though.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to apologize. But what was the reason? I just thought about helping out for a bit.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the reason. That was Rona\u2019s play, Waka-sama.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Eh?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if she anticipated the numbers as well, but that woman wanted to have Waka-sama cooperate by having a strong enemy attack.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>No no, isn\u2019t that being oversuspecious?</p><br/><p>Their allies also suffered quite the bad time there too, you know?</p><br/><p>\u201cNo well, that\u2019s\u2026\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cAs proof, they were properly able to deal with it even without us going out ourselves, right? Deal with everything.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>A white lion, snow guardian dog, and a Frost Dragon that had scales resembling ice; it is true that the demons were able to deal with it by themselves.</p><br/><p>But would that give enough foundation?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I still have a bit more basis. Even in that situation, they didn\u2019t cut off the barrier against cold, and even when the people decreased, they soon rearranged their formation. It could be evaluated as splendid discipline, but for me, it looked like they were reacting in a way as if they had already anticipated it beforehand.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>The barrier against cold was not dissolved even when in the middle of the battle.</p><br/><p>They also quickly filled up the holes in their formation.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that you mention it, there were several who were frequently keeping an eye on us while in battle. Rona was acting as normal though.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t notice at all.</p><br/><p>Within that blizzard in the darkness, I didn\u2019t pay much attention to my surroundings.</p><br/><p>I gotta reflect on that.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. The demons won\u2019t request for cooperation from their side. But if we are the ones stepping forward to provide it, it would be possible. They would be able to see at least a bit of our side\u2019s power, and it would also create a sense of camaraderie.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you are saying that they already expected the deaths of their subordinates?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThey must have taken death into account. For the sake of knowing the whole picture, they were prepared to take sacrifices. To the point that even the demon race that hasn\u2019t grasped us completely, is welcoming us as country-level guests.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>That in itself is pointless though.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor a mere company representative, this degree of reception is too exaggerated as expected huh. There\u2019s two demon generals after all.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Also, Io\u2019s self-introduction and Rona\u2019s greeting, did you notice?\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>That huh.</p><br/><p>I also felt something slightly strange from that.</p><br/><p>Even so, it is to the level that I wouldn\u2019t pay it any mind unless pointed out though.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, something was strange there. Io was acting as if this were our first time meeting, and Rona was frank like the time before the event with the Variants.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly. Io wanted to null what happened at the kingdom\u2019s capital, and Rona wanted to imply that her real self was the one before the Variant incident.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>What\u2019s with that.</p><br/><p>\u201cA-Are they not feeling well?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>But if that\u2019s the case\u2026 It was the right choice not to say: \u2018Didn\u2019t we meet at the Kingdom\u2019s capital though?\u2019.</p><br/><p>If I said that, it would be like completely negating the expectations of Io.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Demon Lord will probably say something regarding that, but I think that it does have that kind of meaning. In other words\u2026\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>Shiki cuts his words for a second and narrows his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2018We want to wash away the \u2018unintentional bad things\u2019 that happened and create a good relationship.\u2019 It seems like the demon race really wants Waka-sama and the Kuzunoha Company. At this rate, when we reach the capital, they might even make a parade for us. Kufufufu.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t kufufu.</p><br/><p>Aren\u2019t you turning into Tomoe, Shiki?</p><br/><p>If you enter the dark side, my internal oasis will disappear.</p><br/><p>Please spare me from that.</p><br/><p>\u201cA parade. If it were a party, there would be worth in it.\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cMio-dono, having a parade without a party is basically impossible. In the ranks of welcoming, a banquet is a basic after all.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Then that\u2019s fine-desu ne.\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Not good.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we talk about the characteristics of the demon race cuisine, it would be for example; a meat that they leave half frozen and make thin slices of it just like that to eat. Using different flavored ice, they make a variety of iced cuisine. The last time I went there, I only saw to that extent, but they are in such a prejudiced environment, so there should be a lot more than that.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cAre we going to enter the capital by today?\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I heard that today we will be staying the night at a town. The capital will be tomorrow.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, ah yeah, I am looking forward\u2026to the frozen cooking.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I answered unconsciously.</p><br/><p>\u2026Cold food in winter huh.</p><br/><p>Eating ice cream in a kotatsu is ordinary, but I wonder if that\u2019s the same case here.</p><br/><p>I stand up and look at the state outside.</p><br/><p>An ice ground where we can\u2019t see what\u2019s ahead anymore, even the stars can\u2019t be seen. Complete darkness and violent blowing wind and snow.</p><br/><p>Only the sound of the strong winds resounded.</p><br/><p>Even if you tell me about frozen meat and ice cuisine in a place like this, I don\u2019t feel any sort of appetite welling up from me.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6</p><br/><p>*Clank*</p><br/><p>The door silently closes.</p><br/><p>\u201cRoot! You\u2026what\u2019s with suddenly sending an out of common sense along with the egg of Lancer to the Sand Sea and making a mess out of it, and Oba-san!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The young woman continued shouting words that had no coherence until she finally calmed down. Taking off her hood, she approaches the person that was at the end of the room.</p><br/><p>Unbuttoning her tunic, she takes off her hooded robe and throws it away towards the sofa at the side.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite the greeting-ja na, Sand Wave. It is our long time reunion and you suddenly come like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c?!! Ah, sorry. I reflexively\u2026\u201d (Grount)</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected huh. Well, I believed that Makoto-kun would definitely be able to do it! The desert is an area that not even I can peek at, so in times like this, I truly regret not being able to see it!\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>The woman thought that he was alone, but seeing the person standing, she soon apologized and turned speechless.</p><br/><p>And the woman that was at the depths of the room, had a wide smile as she herself walked towards the place where Grount is.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, Shen?! Eh, but I feel like you are slightly different\u2026\u201d (Grount)</p><br/><p>\u201cI am Shen-ja yo. No, I was Shen would be a more appropriate way to put it. I have tied a ruling pact with a certain person you see. Right now I am faithfully serving him as a servant of his.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cPact? A\u2026ruling one?\u201d (Grount)</p><br/><p>Grount wasn\u2019t thinking when talking, it was as if she were returning answers inorganically like a parrot.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. That\u2019s why, I go by the name Tomoe. I recently went to the Empire you know. Together with my master.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cAra. If you had visited, I would have brought out tea. Don\u2019t act so distant. But well, I was a bit busy myself so it can\u2019t be helped huh. I am sorry for not offering any reception. Even though you went out of your way to walk out of the wasteland.\u201d (Grount)</p><br/><p>Experiencing an unexpected reunion with an old friend dragon, the woman -Superior Dragon Sand Wave, named Grount- greets Tomoe.</p><br/><p>As one would expect, she still doesn\u2019t understand the situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuku, and so Grount, you had some business with me, right?\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>Root sits at an opposite sofa from Tomoe and looks at the still standing Grount.</p><br/><p>\u201c!! That\u2019s right, Root! What\u2019s with that hyuman?! It was Lancer\u2019s egg, the egg of a superior dragon, you know?! And to entrust it to something like a hyuman!!\u201d (Grount)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut he was strong, right?\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cW-Well that is\u2026\u201d (Grount)</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected, stronger than me?\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cAt the very least, I felt more despair compared to the time when I was fighting you.\u201d (Grount)</p><br/><p>\u201cHah\u2026so it was huh. That hurts. A fellow superior dragon is telling me in this way after all. Just what in the world is Makoto-kun trying to become?\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>Root throws his back towards the sofa and looks at the ceiling.</p><br/><p>Contrary to his words, he looked quite happy.</p><br/><p>\u201cMakoto? No, he said his name was Raidou though.\u201d (Grount)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, whichever is fine. Makoto-kun is Raidou after all. Well, you know, it is that; he has two names just like us. Don\u2019t mind it.\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so\u2026then\u2026 like hell I will swallow that answer! I will have you explain it properly! About that ultima weapon-like hyuman, the reason why Lancer has turned into an egg, and the reason why I have to look after Lancer!!\u201d (Grount)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 But you know Tomoe, it is incredible huh. There\u2019s this many superior dragons gathered in one room of the Adventurer Guild. This is a little like a summit, don\u2019t you think? Summit 5?\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>Grount has an incredibly threatening attitude beside Tomoe. Sitting right in front of Root, she draws closer to him.</p><br/><p>But Root cooly washed away that stern expression of hers and throws the conversation to Tomoe.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only the 3 of us in the room though.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cHow sad. If Grount had brought Lancer, it would have been 6.\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you continue piling up words that are not getting through, there would be no point.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cFor us who gather rarely, this is quite the event though\u2026\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cRoot!! Just what in the world are you saying!! I won\u2019t be deceived!!\u201d (Grount)</p><br/><p>Grount\u2019s threatening attitude didn\u2019t stop.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know. You are talking about Lancer, right? I will be explaining it now geez. See, here.\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Hah?\u201d (Grount)</p><br/><p>Root takes out two eggs from who knows where and puts them on the table.</p><br/><p>Grount\u2019s eyes open wide.</p><br/><p>Because she understood what those eggs were.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis one is Night Clad, and this one here is Waterfall. And so, it is regretful. Aside from us, all the other superior dragons have been hunted down~!!\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Uhm, eh?\u201d (Grount)</p><br/><p>\u201cAt first it was the Famed Sword, Lancer. The next would be Waterfall, and the one after was Night Clad. Crimson Red was the last one. Went around killing them all you see.\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hear any of this you know?\u201d (Grount)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe superior dragons were being targeted, so don\u2019t you think the person responsible had done the necessary to prevent it from getting out?\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201c!!! Don\u2019t tell me, that hyuman was the one who did it?!\u201d (Grount)</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh. Ah, that\u2019s wrong. He is the one who settled the problem. He defeated the offender. And so they became eggs. About Lancer, he doesn\u2019t have anyone to take care of it, so I thought of leaving him to you. That\u2019s why I requested Makoto-kun to do the errand.\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Just who in the world was the one responsible?\u201d (Grount)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is embarrassing to say but, the one responsible was a mixed breed of a hyuman and dragon that superbly inherited my blood. You see, it went absorbing the power of the defeated dragons and had become quite the crazy issue. Even the Empire\u2019s hero-kun was at the verge of dying. Ah~, I\u2019m truly sorry.\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Empire\u2019s hero. Ah, the charm one. Because that thing was there, I returned to my younger self and was thinking of being absent from the Empire for a while.\u201d (Grount)</p><br/><p>Grount was showing a suffering expression as if holding in a headache.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are in this state of situation, so do spare me from doing that. After things have calmed down, you can do it. In your case, you are able to reincarnate with your memories intact after all. That technique, I would really like you to teach it to me.\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is unnecessary for you who can live by without reincarnating, right? And so?\u201d (Grount)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so, what?\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat hyuman, just how did he defeat a monster that had devoured the power of 4 superior dragons? You cooperated as well, right?\u201d (Grount)</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, it was a straight battle of power. Regarding me, it was like, I gave the last hit? Thanks to that, I ended up in a variety of circumstances with him though. Well, he is a boy that is fun to get involved with, so I don\u2019t really mind.\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>The eyes of Grount are wide open once again.</p><br/><p>Her mouth was also wide open as if her jaw had dislocated.</p><br/><p>Tomoe who was silent, was covering her mouth and trying to hold down her laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Root, just how long are you going to keep joking around? From what point should I begin to seriously listen?\u201d (Grount)</p><br/><p>\u201cHow rude. The only joke I made was the message I gave to Makoto-kun, but everything else I spoke seriously.\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cMessage?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I told him that at the Empire there\u2019s my Oba-san dragon by the name of Grount, so please bring the egg of Lancer to her.\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it really was your doiiiing!!!\u201d (Grount)</p><br/><p>With a speed akin to instant movement, Grount puts one leg on the table and grabs the collar of Root, lifts it, and shakes it violently back and forth.</p><br/><p>It is the most movement they have had today.</p><br/><p>\u201cWai-, ugah, calm\u2026down!!\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cLike hell I can be calm!! This is the first time I have tasted such a despairing experience you know?! My blaze couldn\u2019t even make his clothes flutter; when my spell hit him, it wouldn\u2019t reach and would be cancelled! My nails and fangs as well, no matter how many times I hit him, he shook his head apologetically!!\u201d (Grount)</p><br/><p>\u201cAcha~. That magic armor has that much strength huh. Moreover, it seems to have stabilized quite a bit. How scary.\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is not on the level of scary! At the end, my nails were cracked and hurt a lot you know?! See here!!\u201d (Grount)</p><br/><p>While hanging Root with one hand, Grount stretches her right hand before Root\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Her fingers were beautiful, but just like she said, her nails were grandly cracked and were in a hurting state that people would frown when looking at it.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have them healed?\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Tomoe asks Grount as she sips her tea.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe did ask me if I wanted it healed. But\u2026 there\u2019s no way I would just go: \u2018Okay, please\u2019, right?! Spreading blood lust, throwing out attacks, and when I was tired, I got artlessly grabbed and thrown away; he said that right after!!! It took me my whole to say: \u2018Don\u2019t look down on me, what\u2019s your business?\u2019, you know?!\u201d (Grount)</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. For a crushed dragon like you, Waka was unable to say anymore huh.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cI also have my pride as a superior dragon\u2026 Waka?\u201d (Grount)</p><br/><p>Grount who has been responding to Tomoe without facing her, at this moment for the first time, she turned her face towards the back where Tomoe is.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I told you that I was at the Empire, right? Along with my master.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d (Grount)</p><br/><p>\u201cMy master\u2019s name is Raidou-ja.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>The air in the area froze.</p><br/><p>The one who was creating a noisy atmosphere was Grount, and the person herself had frozen in place.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 What did you say?\u201d (Grount)</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I say it already? That I had made a ruling pact with a hyuman. That person was Raidou, or Makoto-sama to put it in another way. My master-ja.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cA ruling\u2026pact. You did say it before\u2026 EEEEHH?! You made a ruling pact\u2026 with a HYUMAN?!\u201d (Grount)</p><br/><p>\u201cJust how long do you take to get it? Are you aiming to become an actress or something?\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, but Tomoe, a superior dragon and a hyuman\u2026 ruling; and that\u2019s with that boy, Raidou?\u201d (Grount)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right-ja. Oh, don\u2019t put down Root. Keep him like that-ja.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Tomoe stops Grount who had lost the strength in her arm that was holding Root because of her absentminded state.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, why are you saying something like that, Tomoe? Wasn\u2019t the talk heading to drinking all together after a long awaited reunion between superior dragons? If I remember correctly, you have a delicious Sake that you made.\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>Root felt an air of turbulence stroking his cheek.</p><br/><p>He timidly confirms with Tomoe.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, there\u2019s no lie in that. But you see\u2026\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Tomoe faces Root who was across Grount, and continues speaking with eyes holding a sharp light different from any before.</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore the drinking bout, I have something I want to ask. Well, I have already gotten a confession though. How dare you set up Waka to say the taboo word at Grount. Moreover, in a misunderstanding where he would most likely say it repeatedly.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cN-No well, that\u2019s you see\u2026 I was 100% sure that Makoto-kun wouldn\u2019t go for the kill, and I also knew that Grount wouldn\u2019t be able to kill him, so\u2026 see? When thinking about it properly, don\u2019t you think that the best way to understand Makoto-kun is after exchanging fists with him?\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Because of that, I suffered quite a wound in my heart though?\u201d (Grount)</p><br/><p>\u201cG-Grount, let\u2019s calm down. 1vs2 isn\u2019t something a superior dragon should do. Don\u2019t you think so?\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cBe at ease, Grount. At the drinking bout later, I will have you heal that wound with the best Sake. That\u2019s why right now\u2026 you understand-ja na?\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Root and Tomoe face Grount and speak to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood. Right now your name is Tomoe, right? We have to talk for a bit to this idiot with bad taste, isn\u2019t it?\u201d (Grount)</p><br/><p>\u201cUmu. Of course, a talk with fists, that is.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, with fists. In good time. After this finishes, I will get treatment for my nails.\u201d (Grount)</p><br/><p>\u201cTomoe, from the beginning you came here with those intentions, weren\u2019t you?!\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have went a bit out of boundaries, Root. It is still long till night. It is a nice time to take a break!!\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cI will have you learn how scared I was!!\u201d (Grount)</p><br/><p>\u201cWai-?! Today I seriously have work piled u\u2014- agaaaaaa\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>That night, the two dragon princesses were moistening their throats to their heart\u2019s content with the japanese Sake.</p><br/><p>Excluding one of them who had his wounds sting.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

At the third floor, there was an Alt engraved at the entrance\u2026\u2026.!!! Could it be the \u2018Crimson Corridor\u2019?! To think it actually existed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have confirmed the Crimson Corridor\u2026 I won\u2019t be surprised anymore. I have grown up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Accomplishing the first encounter of a Marikosan, I was able to reunite with everyone at the next floor.</p><br/><p>We decided to finish the exploration of that day and returned to the hotel.</p><br/><p>Third floor clear.</p><br/><p>We anticipated that we would be able to go even lower, but we had a harder time than expected.</p><br/><p>While we were doing a reflection meeting of sorts, Iroha-chan and her group who were taking refuge here were participating at some point in time.</p><br/><p>Shougetsu-san was surprised when he heard the name Crimson Corridor and we received words of surrender from Iroha-chan.</p><br/><p>\u201cAccording to Hokuto, the route till the 10th floor has been made, and if there\u2019s a problem happening from tomorrow on, it would definitely be those Alt floors. A place where not even thought transmission works, just what kind of mechanism is at work there?\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the part. It seems like there\u2019s some sort of requirements. You have to show excelling results at the previous floor in order to be thrown to those Alt floors, so it would be bad to hurry too much and get everyone separated.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t think speed is the only condition.</p><br/><p>At the Garden, the condition was the number of Drakes defeated, or it was at least one of the conditions.</p><br/><p>Leaving me aside, in the cases where Beren, Hokuto or Shii are thrown into the Alt floor, it might become dangerous.</p><br/><p>The lower we go, the dangers most likely increase.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, how about going to the labyrinth with just Tomoe-san, Waka-sama, and I from tomorrow on? If it\u2019s us, no matter who gets thrown into the strange floor, there won\u2019t be much problems.\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Mio proposes what\u2019s possibly the number one safest way.</p><br/><p>It is true that with that there will be no dangers.</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s only us three, most of anything would be okay.</p><br/><p>But\u2026there will be no mapping from Hokuto, no judgment from Beren, and no deftness of Shii.</p><br/><p>In a dungeon environment, their abilities might even be better adapted than us three. Especially in lower floors where we don\u2019t have a decent amount of information. That can\u2019t be called a good idea.</p><br/><p>Yeah.</p><br/><p>The words of Mio served as the trigger. A number of proposals were coming here and there.</p><br/><p>Of course, there were the proposals saying they wanted to accompany us. Their desire to accompany us from tomorrow on was clear to see.</p><br/><p>Even if they don\u2019t go to the labyrinth, they can do things like gather information regarding Iroha-chan, so it is not like there\u2019s nothing for them to do.</p><br/><p>But that part is not the original objective, or more like, its priority is low.</p><br/><p>The number one priority is to put all our effort in making the negotiation with the mercenary group succeed, you know\u2026</p><br/><p>The reflection meeting that continued till dinner had idle talk mixed in it as well, and it didn\u2019t look like the decision could be reached.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have an opinion. Is it okay to say it?\u201d</p><br/><p>That voice came from my back.</p><br/><p>At a place that was close to my neck, a blade was placed there, and with the other hand that wasn\u2019t holding it, that person saluted.</p><br/><p>\u201c?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tomoe, Mio, and everyone else noticed the current situation after those words.</p><br/><p>Well, that was the same for me.</p><br/><p>It truly was as if he had suddenly appeared just now.</p><br/><p>Really a surprise.</p><br/><p>So surprised that I lost the chance to get panicked.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrand Master?!\u201d</p><br/><p>But within that surprise, one person directed the words \u2018Grand Master\u2019 at that man.</p><br/><p>A word I am not familiar with.</p><br/><p>It is a word that I feel was given to some sort of robot in a game.</p><br/><p>The owner of the voice is Shougetsu-san.</p><br/><p>\u201cUmu, it has been a while, Shougetsu-kun. You have gotten quite the presence now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY-Yes. Rokuya-sama truly hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d (Shougetsu)</p><br/><p>\u201cI am an eternal 20 years old after all.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>Suddenly turning his blade at me, yet speaking nonchalantly; I don\u2019t know what kind of intentions he has, but this man that seems to be an acquaintance of Shougetsu-san even introduced himself and made a joke. He parted the blade from my neck, and, without any noise, he moves towards the wall and places his back there.</p><br/><p>Is he an assassin? </p><br/><p>I can instantly tell that he is incredibly skilled.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know what skill it was, but not a single person in this room was able to catch his presence.</p><br/><p>Because he moved, I was able to confirm his appearance as well.</p><br/><p>He has a low height similar to mine which is pretty rare in this world, white hair that\u2019s neither long or short, extremities that I can feel firmness and flexibility from.</p><br/><p>To my surprise, his appearance is a lot further than the standard of this world, even more than me. </p><br/><p>The identity of the blade that was at my neck are a pair of katars.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t taking a stance with them, he only had them with him.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Shougetsu-san, who is he?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2026Rokuya-sama is my\u2026master\u2019s master.\u201d (Shougetsu)</p><br/><p>Master\u2019s master?</p><br/><p>Ah, so that\u2019s why it is grand huh.</p><br/><p>Like when you say grandparent.</p><br/><p>Shougetsu-san who is already an old man is calling him the master of his master; just how should I read those words of being \u2018eternally 20 years old\u2019?</p><br/><p>However, the appearance of the man named Rokuya is really around 20.</p><br/><p>Is his aging stopped with some sort of method?</p><br/><p>\u201cI am a passing assassin, name\u2019s Rokuya. Pleased to meet you.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201cI am Raidou. The representative of Kuzunoha Company. Pleasure is mine.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry for doing something dangerous a few moments ago. Since I wanted to see the person who was able to pass the Crimson Corridor, I suddenly did something as stupid as that against my better judgment. Even though you were approached to such a proximity, you didn\u2019t seem to flinch at all. It has been a while since that happened. You are quite\u2026splendid.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201cRokuya\u2026 Assassin Rokuya. Are you the real one? You are still alive? Is this a joke?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought Shougetsu-sama was able to make funny jokes, and yet\u2026seriously, this joke\u2019s not funny at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two bodyguards of Iroha-chan were dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>By the way, Tomoe and Mio had taken their battle stances in an instant, so I command them with my hand and calm them down.</p><br/><p>Because if he went through the trouble of speaking with us, that means he didn\u2019t come here with the intentions of killing.</p><br/><p>He is still an unknown factor though.</p><br/><p>\u201cRokuya-san, was it?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. The remaining people here are your subordinates, and\u2026the people that serve princess Iroha, right?\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. And so, is it okay to assume that you are not an enemy?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I heard the word Assassin.</p><br/><p>Lately, I have been attacked by those all the time.</p><br/><p>Even I wouldn\u2019t just assume that he is not related.</p><br/><p>\u201cFumu, currently, the answer to that question would be that\u2026I am not.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>After a short silence, Rokuya-san faces me and answers in that fashion.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Then, what\u2019s your business?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cI was a bit interested in the objective of you guys. I heard that Raidou-kun\u2019s objective is the 20th floor, more accurately speaking, the mercenary group. Is that true?\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Yeah, that\u2019s true. But that doesn\u2019t answer my question.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, I know. Let\u2019s answer in order. About me, well, it would help me a lot if you just ask that from Shougetsu-kun later. In that way, the information would be more definite than if I were to say it myself after all.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>It is more definite than him speaking himself?</p><br/><p>What does that mean?</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, what\u2019s your answer to Waka\u2019s question-ja? Speak in the time we are being docile.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I shall do, dragon samurai. The reason why I visited Raidou-kun\u2026one of them is, just as I said before, my interest for the person that was able to pass the third floor\u2019s Alt floor; the other one was to confirm his objective; and the last one, is to leave a message to him.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201cMessage, you say?\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>From the voice of Tomoe, I could tell that she was pretty angered towards Rokuya-san.</p><br/><p>That was the same for Mio and everyone of Asora here.</p><br/><p>Everyone from Iroha\u2019s side seemed to feel some sort of reverence towards this person called Rokuya-san.</p><br/><p>The reason why they haven\u2019t participated at all in the conversation unless they are directly spoken to by Rokuya-san must be because of those emotions of theirs.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight now, my comrades and I are together with the mercenary group you set your objective on. By the way, the current leader of that mercenary group is my disciple you see. Name\u2019s Vivi \u2013not Bibi, okay? She gets pretty angry about that, so be careful. Also, she can be considered the direct mentor of Shougetsu-kun there.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>?!</p><br/><p>The leader of the mercenary group is the mentor of Shougetsu-san?!</p><br/><p>Wouldn\u2019t that make her quite the old woman?!</p><br/><p>Is she still in active duty?</p><br/><p>Well, it seems like she is mindful about being called Bibi instead of Vivi -though I feel like they are both the same-, so at that time, let\u2019s be considerate about it.</p><br/><p>My name is Makoto, but if we play with the words a bit, it can turn into Maggot , and I wouldn\u2019t like that either.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Vivi-sama is my mentor. She is probably the person that possesses the most prominent skills in stalking and surprise attacks. A pro at raids.\u201d (Shougetsu)</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>What an unpleasant explanation.</p><br/><p>Yeah, I don\u2019t like it.</p><br/><p>As a negotiation target, I don\u2019t have a good feeling about this.</p><br/><p>Even before I meet her, I can say that.</p><br/><p>When I look at Shougetsu-san, I could see that he was talking about his mentor with pride. There were no signs of doubt. He didn\u2019t feel anything negative from it.</p><br/><p>Have no choice but to say that they are in a great teacher and student relationship.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. Then, that message you have for me is\u2026\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Could it be from that Vivi-san?</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it is not from her. It is from a different person that\u2019s at the same floor. It was a favor from a comrade of mine, so I am fulfilling it since I was going outside anyways. Well, I decided to take it. As a result, I was able to meet an\u2026outstanding talent like you.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201cA different person\u2026\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know the details of his business or his plans, but according to him: \u2018Going right now would be the worst timing for both sides. If you want to negotiate with Rosegarden, I want you to wait for a while\u2019.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>Worst timing huh.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know the current situation of the 20th floor, but it doesn\u2019t sound like a message with evil-intent.</p><br/><p>Wait, huh.</p><br/><p>It depends how long.</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s to a certain extent, I think I can wait.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat \u2018wait\u2019, how long is it exactly?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t told the details. If it is okay with my subjective opinion, I can tell you though.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. To me, it felt like he was talking about several years time.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>Nope.</p><br/><p>Can\u2019t wait for so long.</p><br/><p>And those are not the words of the mercenary group\u2019s Vivi-san, but of someone else.</p><br/><p>In other words, it was a warning from a third party.</p><br/><p>They don\u2019t know our circumstances either.</p><br/><p>Then, there\u2019s plenty room to try and make a direct negotiation.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026You have a face that\u2019s saying it is way too long.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201cJust as you say. We want to request the strength of Picnic Rosegarden as soon as possible.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand. It might be rude to say this, but I don\u2019t think you guys need their strength at all. If it\u2019s a battle at the 20th floor, it is certainly true that they might be strong enough to be a match, but\u2026everything aside from that, I don\u2019t think you guys would be falling behind them at all. You guys are stronger.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe ones who need the strength of the rumored numbered one strongest at defensive battles are not us but Tsige.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I decided to speak about our circumstances.</p><br/><p>How to say it, it is because I felt like it was okay to speak about this to this Rokuya person in front of me.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsige. The town of the people that challenge the World\u2019s Border huh. No, it might not be the case now though.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, you are correct. Currently, Tsige is aiming for an independence from Aion and is fighting against two forces. Of course, in the advocacy of war, there\u2019s negotiations and verbal disputes, but the strengthening of defenses is an urgent matter, and it is the strength that Tsige currently lacks the most.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Are you saying that what you lack, Rosegarden can fill it?\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>The attitude of Rokuya-san was still skeptical.</p><br/><p>The Kuzunoha Company and Picnic Rosegarden.</p><br/><p>Looking at both as fighting forces and knowing them to a certain extent, it seems like he sees us as quite the power.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are thinking about being only a temporary help to Tsige.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cA mercenary group that\u2019s hired with money is the very definition of temporary, you know?\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut this will definitely become the example for many of the combatants of Tsige, and I think they will become an existence that will provide many lessons to them.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Is that the meaning of your \u2018temporary\u2019?\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Yes. I \u2013the Kuzunoha Company is being called abnormal and monsters by a lot of people after all.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cKuku!! Abnormal and monsters huh! That\u2019s quite unfortunate. You guys must be relied upon by their own convenience quite a lot then.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>The calm face of Rokuya-san changed to a broad smile in an instant.</p><br/><p>It was short, but it was to the point that he even laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really mind being relied on. As long as we are there, that is. Tsige has been taking care of us as well after all.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Hoh. If you don\u2019t think of it as a pain or troublesome, then, why is it not okay for you guys to help them out?\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are being viewed as monsters by a lot of people, that\u2019s why no one would want to learn from people like that. The word monster itself is a word that arbitrarily places the person as different kind of existences from themselves. A good habit.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat wouldn\u2019t do. That\u2019s why I want Tsige to be able to protect itself even after the independence. For that sake, I want to obtain the seed for it. If it\u2019s them who have survived, protected till the end, and have worked as an organization, I think they will be able to become that seed. Even if the day that we have to leave Tsige arrives, I would be able to have peace of mind.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Truly\u2026interesting. Fumu. Now that I have heard this, the story changes. I have already mentioned this \u2018worst situation\u2019, and if Vivi and the others are handed down to Tsige, that would be great.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>Hearing my words, the complexion of Rokuya-san changed, and while muttering his thoughts, he moves left and right.</p><br/><p>However, that figure of his had no openings.</p><br/><p>He is a person that\u2019s always ready for battle.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you were with the intentions of having an excursion, I would have had you leave, but it seems like it was completely different. You have obtained an official entrance permission from the Empress, and your power\u2026your way of thinking\u2026yeah, nice!\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Nice?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>It is a word I wasn\u2019t really expecting.</p><br/><p>\u201cLater, I want you to show me how abnormal you are, how much of a monster you guys are. If you are able to do that, I will become your intermediary. Saying it myself is questionable, but I can become a reliable ally, you know. Vivi is a wei\u2014bothersome girl, but I -her master- will be your ally, so that single point alone would be an advantage. You can understand that, right?\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>It is not certain that she is a person that respects her mentor though. Things like the Confucianism had their questionable parts too after all.</p><br/><p>I look at Shougetsu-san.</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s him who knows her directly, he should be able to serve as a measurement.</p><br/><p>The result of the eye contact was a serious nod in return.</p><br/><p>Okay, let\u2019s accept.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is a grateful proposal. Then, is it okay to fight you now? Or do you have some sort of challenge in mind?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha. I am an assassin, you know? Even if I were to fight against this many powerhouses up front, it is clear that I will be defeated midway. It is the latter. I want you to reach the 10th floor by tomorrow. You can, right? You have enough power to be called a monster after all.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201cWith Alt floors and all?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Haha, right. There were those. Understood. I will turn those off. No need to worry.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201cOff?!\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s something like that, there\u2019s no problem in doing it temporarily. The one who wanted me to leave a message to you was the designer of Yaso-Katsui\u2019s grand labyrinth after all. Him being there means that the last fail-safe has activated, in other words, it is a crisis for the grand labyrinth, but to tell you the truth, I don\u2019t really feel that negative about it though. That extreme shut-in can be a pretty good talk when you speak with him personally. Seriously.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201cI see\u2026 eh?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>The designer of the grand labyrinth?!</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t really want to meet him though?!</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t think I can have a good conversation with someone that has been a shut-in deep underground since forever(most likely).</p><br/><p>Wait, Rokuya-san is not here anymore.</p><br/><p>S-Since when?</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t notice at all again.</p><br/><p>He nonchalantly said something dangerous like \u2018crisis for the grand dungeon\u2019.</p><br/><p>I only have a bad feeling about this.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What a scary one-ja na. Depending on the situation, he can seal our thought transmission, infiltrate in anyone\u2019s room without the person noticing, and disappear. Looks like this won\u2019t end in simple sightseeing. Well, Waka, he really got us there.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Tomoe, who doesn\u2019t really seem like she actually feels that way, only speaks heavily on her opening statement.</p><br/><p>Moreover, the latter half sounded like she was having a hell lot of fun.</p><br/><p>\u201cShougetsu, speak in detail about that person. Immediately, without hiding anything, and make it brief. Begin.\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Mio doesn\u2019t seem to be in a good mood.</p><br/><p>Looks like she doesn\u2019t see Rokuya-san in a favorable light.</p><br/><p>This is of no importance, but I feel like saying everything without hiding anything while being brief about it is quite the difficult request.</p><br/><p>Moreover, no questions asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, yes. Of course I will speak about what I know. Rokuya-sama seemed to be welcoming it after all.\u201d (Shougetsu)</p><br/><p>\u201cI said brief!!\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>So strict.</p><br/><p>It seems she won\u2019t accept any extra talk.</p><br/><p>However, in the talk of Shougetsu-san that he began after being urged by Mio, there was something\u2026Shougecking\u2013I mean, shocking in it.</p><br/><p>\u201cRokuya-sama is one of the people called the \u2018Adventurers of Origin\u2019. It seems like, in a long past, there were legends at every country about it, but now, most of those stories were not lost and still mostly remain at only the major power Lorel. Now then, I will be speaking of the legends and about my experience. Everything I know of.\u201d (Shougetsu)</p><br/>\n</div>"}

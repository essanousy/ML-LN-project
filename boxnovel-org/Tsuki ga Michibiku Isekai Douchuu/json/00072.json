You guys really persisted\u201d (Io)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen cornered, anyone would show power surpassing their limits\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>The surplus-filled words of Io were answered by Hibiki with a reckless shout while dodging attacks.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is wrong. Being able to show power surpassing your limits only happens when you have properly grown and trained. You guys are truly skilled warriors. It seems I was misunderstanding the hero a great deal\u201d (Io)</p><br/><p>The compliments that came out indifferently from his mouth.</p><br/><p>3 meters, from a normal person\u2019s point of view this could be called quite the height. Using this body so agilely, he showed feats that would make first rate martial artists grief.</p><br/><p>\u201cPower-type trunk\u201d was quite the misconception. Hibiki felt hatred from the bottom of her heart at the idiot that made such an analysis. These were movements of someone that has polished his body.</p><br/><p>A giant that one would normally think would use an axe or stick on his various arms and mindlessly swing them around. The real thing was completely different.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe attacks don\u2019t hit properly! This guy has a worst disposition than the spider!\u201d (Naval)</p><br/><p>Naval\u2019s scream. This is true. The flashes that she has been releasing have not passed properly as attacks after all. Since the beginning, the attacks of her have gotten his arms from different angles a number of times, but not even his skin was scratched. Moreover, he won\u2019t let attacks on the same spot reach. He deftly shifts and with some kind of method, he makes the edge slide off his hardened skin.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t self-depreciate yourself that way, white woman. Even though it is powerless, it is truly a splendid sword technique\u201d (Io)</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you pretending to be a martial arts instructor?! Gu wu wu!!\u201d (Bredda)</p><br/><p>Bredda goes to where Naval is and jumps to divert the trajectory of one of his arms\u2019 attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cAn instructor huh! That sounds nice. People like you that can take my attacks for so long are rare. How about it? Want to come to the demons side? Tto\u201d (Io)</p><br/><p>Io uses a step that makes it look like he shifted his body\u2019s direction in an instant to change his position. In the space he was previously in, a something made out of magic power passes by.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you able to dodge invisible wind?! Can you read the aria?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wrong, wind user. If one knows how much magic power is put in it, one is able to read most of the attacks that come. The place it is aimed at and the place it will activate, your eyes tell me that information\u201d (Io)</p><br/><p>This could be called an action brought by his enormous amount of experience. No matter if he says it, there wouldn\u2019t be many who would be able to actually do it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will have you let us move forward once and for all!\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c!! Nicely done!\u201d (Io)</p><br/><p>Because of Hibiki\u2019s sharp charge, Io is somewhat pushed back. But it wasn\u2019t like Hibiki had reached the level of a demon general, it is just that his pre-established settings of her true abilities were beginning to be surpassed, that\u2019s all.</p><br/><p>To surpass the estimation of a general with vast amounts of experience is not something a normal person could do, but this was only a slight surprise for him.</p><br/><p>A definite feedback is felt from Hibiki\u2019s hands. The feeling of her sword reaching to her bones. Hibiki\u2019s sword was able to slice one of Io\u2019s hands till the middle.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, admirable. But how do you plan on surpassing the next barrier, hero?\u201d (Io)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I can\u2019t take it out?!\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I tighten my muscles, you won\u2019t be able to take out your sword. And so, your movements will stop as well!\u201d (Io)</p><br/><p>\u201c!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hibiki understood what would happen after this.</p><br/><p>She instantly separates from her sword. This is an action stemming from Hibiki\u2019s trust of her instincts.</p><br/><p>A dull sound. This was the first attack she had received in this battle. Moreover, this is the first attack she received since she came to this world that didn\u2019t have a single divine protection from the Goddess.</p><br/><p>Hibiki flies like a pebble being kicked off. Chiya runs after her at once.</p><br/><p>\u201cGa-ha!! U\u2026 go ho\u2026 wu\u2026\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>(It hurts! It hurts! It hurts! It hurts!) (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Hibiki\u2019s thoughts get dyed in one color. Is this the effect of losing the Goddess\u2019 divine protection? For a moment, Hibiki thought this way.</p><br/><p>(Hurts hurts hurts! But! Not having the Goddess\u2019 divine protection doesn\u2019t matter that much! Because I was able to move with not much change. The problem is him, Io. He is just way too strong!) (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Being almost controlled by the sense of pain, she tries to manage, even if for a bit, her reasoning. Think. For now just think. And so, Hibiki, for the sake of returning to her senses, continues to think while squirming.</p><br/><p>(Even my bones are broken. What was punched was my stomach huh. To hit the stomach of a woman, how ungentlemanly. It seems there is a need to punish him. Ah, my mouth is filled with the taste of blood. It feels like it is coming from my throat. So lucky there is magic in this world. In normal circumstances I wouldn\u2019t be able to eat food tonight, but with healing magic I can even go for meat. I am lucky) (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>With her still disarranged thoughts, she tries to avert her attention from her wounds. It seems that the self-recovery magic that was activated in the moment was steadily showing effects, her pain was slowly softening. Having Chiya\u2019s healing magic on top of it, both spells synergize and accelerate the healing speed.</p><br/><p>While still being unsteady, Hibiki stands up after a short while.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt that instant you let go of your sword and, even if imperfect, you were even able to put out a barrier huh. I shot that one with the expectations of making you mincemeat though. Truly well done. You have genius-level sense\u201d (Io)</p><br/><p>\u201cHow will you compensate if I end up unable to bear a child? And also, mincemeat you say, how gore. Don\u2019t joke around!\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a lively girl. Have your sword back. It may be a pointless thing for you to do but, how about trying to look for a better sword?\u201d (Io)</p><br/><p>Hibiki receives the sword that was thrown out. Of course, the sword wound in his arm was nowhere to be found anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 When tomorrow comes, I will listen to your advice\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>As usual, the words that showed no sense of tension were somehow returned with impudent talk.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you guys live to see tomorrow, you will have a place to return. Those two premises are impossible\u201d (Io)</p><br/><p>\u201c?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The demon general\u2019s nonchalant words. However, pointing out their place to return, Hibiki and the others uniformly open their eyes wide.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, so you get surprised as expected. Right now a detached force is advancing to Limia\u201d (Io)</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mess around! There is no way the capital will fall with a single unit!\u201d (Bredda)</p><br/><p>Bredda is the first one to object. For the demon race to defy with one unit, there is no way Limia Kingdom would fall so easily. Knowing that the fires of war were approaching his birth place, his appearance clearly changed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are right. The scale is around two thousand. In normal circumstances, this is not a force that can be used to attack a major power\u2019s capital\u201d (Io)</p><br/><p>In Io\u2019s words one could feel pity. He sighs. While affirming Bredda\u2019s words, the latter half stirred up anxiety.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d (Wudi)</p><br/><p>For Wudi, whose family is in the capital, these words felt like someone pouring cold water on him while sleeping. For him who wants his family as far as possible from this war, something that should not happen at any cost is about to happen.</p><br/><p>\u201cMagician huh. Well, it\u2019s just that I have reliable reinforcements that\u2019s all. A power that can even overwhelm me is accompanying me\u201d (Io)</p><br/><p>\u201cIs the demon army a jack-in-the-box? If there are people like you crawling all around, the hyumans would have been annihilated a long time ago\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Hibiki\u2019s sarcasm. But her words didn\u2019t show any composure.</p><br/><p>\u201cHero. That\u2019s just how desperate we are. Now, let\u2019s close the curtains of this act. I will not forget you guys\u2019 bravery. Driving away the spider with only 5 and being hyumans to top. The fact that all of you came out alive tells that your strength is the real thing. There was a time when my best friend and I tried to make it retreat, but I ended up letting him die. A blunder of the young me, I truly regret it\u201d (Io)</p><br/><p>\u201c?!\u201d</p><br/><p>He doesn\u2019t answer Hibiki\u2019s words, he just declares the finale of this fight. Also, the driving away of the calamity spider that worked as an emotional support for Hibiki and the others, Io points out that this wasn\u2019t an experience they alone had achieved.</p><br/><p>It seems there was quite the effect. A clear unrest spreads in the hero\u2019s party. Words that hinted Limia\u2019s ambush and that he had repelled the spider. There is no way Limia\u2019s hero and her party would not get shaken from this.</p><br/><p>(\u2026 I am thoroughly na\u00efve. If I do an effort of 10, I will certainly get a 10. Thinking that, I came. I am putting my life on the line here. I should have tried my best by 100, 1,000, 10,000 times! I should have done that!) (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>What can she do in this despairing situation?</p><br/><p>Defeating Io and saving the capital. As expected, she could clearly declare this; that it is totally impossible.</p><br/><p>Not enough. The power needed is absolutely not enough. For Hibiki, this was the frustration she was originally looking for. This was the step after desperate effort that Hibiki longed for. Therefore, obtaining this, her answer was obvious. No good.</p><br/><p>Having sweat on her cheeks and hair over her face was simply irritating for her. The girl that tried her best and still lost. That was exactly the wish Hibiki had, but the girl began to understand what comes after in that path.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. The reality of what will happen after a hero loses. The girl, Otonashi Hibiki, began to understand the reality of her existence being a center of hope. Her defeat is not limited to only herself anymore.</p><br/><p>At times, there are fights in the battlefield that one simply cannot lose. Being raised in a peaceful land, Hibiki, who had thought this was just a fight in a different world, began to see the reality in it. That she couldn\u2019t continue thinking as she has until now.</p><br/><p>A feeling of defeat that was not on the level of when she was defeated by the black spider was now enveloping Hibiki. For the time being, the whole party was still in a condition that can still fight. But the fact that they don\u2019t feel they can win, slowly breaks their heart.</p><br/><p>\u201c!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Far.</p><br/><p>At a distant place.</p><br/><p>In the direction where the Limia capital is in.</p><br/><p>A golden light of giant magic power proportions splits apart the clouds and pierces the ground.</p><br/><p>Of course, this was a happening that occurred in a faraway place. This was a phenomenon that one could see with their eyes, but to estimate the amount of magic power that light had was something Hibiki and the others couldn\u2019t do from their location.</p><br/><p>The only thing they could tell was that an intense pillar of light appeared, and it was golden in color.</p><br/><p>But what happened? It was a situation that only rolled into the bad side. Hibiki tries to forcefully put her mind together.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is that?!\u201d (Io)</p><br/><p>It seems Io also didn\u2019t expect this to happen. This made them feel a bit better and they could still hope for the better. The words of dismay that the demon general showed for the first time, sounded like music to Hibiki\u2019s ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat may be a plan to reverse things. Everyone! Just for a bit more, let\u2019s struggle!\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cI will accompany you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy magic power is not dried out yet anyways!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best!\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, there is no way they have such a convenient reversal plan. Everyone understood this.</p><br/><p>But even so, the companions that answered the encouragement won\u2019t surrender till the bitter end. This is the strongest weapon that Limia\u2019s hero and her companions possessed.</p><br/><p>(Wudi-dono, I am sorry. Can you give me a bit of your time?)</p><br/><p>(Naval-dono, what is up?) (Wudi)</p><br/><p>Receiving a thought transmission from the girl that was standing with her blade beside Hibiki, Wudi responds without breaking his concentration. A contact from Naval, something that one could count in one\u2019s hands, surprised Wudi.</p><br/><p>(This situation\u2026 there might be a way to escape from it) (Naval)</p><br/><p>(What?! So you need my cooperation for it right?) (Wudi)</p><br/><p>(Yeah. I\u2026 can\u2019t ask this of Chiya) (Naval)</p><br/><p>(\u2026 Let\u2019s hear it) (Wudi)</p><br/><p>(I am a vanguard that against sturdy opponents can only do the job of getting its attention. I have low attack power. Even though I tried to look for a strong weapon, it is as you see) (Naval)</p><br/><p>Naval continues her movements just like before, dodging Io\u2019s attacks while attacking. Seeing her attacking the parts where his defense looks weaker continuously, one couldn\u2019t feel the weakness of her words.</p><br/><p>(I think putting a demon general as the basis is a bit of a rash self-evaluation though) (Wudi)</p><br/><p>(No. I myself understand this. But for the weapon searching I have troubled myself so much with to be useful here) (Naval)</p><br/><p>(What are you trying to say?) (Wudi)</p><br/><p>A conversation held out while Wudi is providing support as well as attack magic. The two of them, without breaking their concentration in battle, were continuing their thought transmission. A show of how much ability they possess, proficient people.</p><br/><p>(Yeah, I got my hands on a secret plan that will explosively increase one\u2019s strength. And a method to obtain immense attack power as well. It is sad that both of them can only be used once) (Naval)</p><br/><p>(\u2026 Naval-dono that is\u2026) (Wudi)</p><br/><p>(A magician like Wudi-dono may already know of it. The fragment of a rose, Rose Sign, and a death god\u2019s note, *Deadly Word*; is what they are called. Quite the amount of magic power is needed to prepare its activation and it is something I can\u2019t use, but it is something you should be able to easily accomplish) (Naval) </p><br/><p>(I refuse. Such a method, Hibiki-dono would not approve of it either) (Wudi)</p><br/><p>(There is no need to tell me, I know Hibiki would be against the idea. But, you understand right? That the escape of the hero is something that has to happen. In a sense, the decision of Tomoki-dono is more adult than Hibiki\u2019s) (Naval)</p><br/><p>(Guh! That is, certainly true\u2026) (Wudi)</p><br/><p>The hero, Otonashi Hibiki, is an existence that must not be lost. Even if one takes away the battle power as a hero, that charisma and way of thinking, and in times their casual words that one can obtain ideas from, all of those are things that the Kingdom needs.</p><br/><p>(That\u2019s why, I ask of you. I want you to please let me save Hibiki. You also want to live and reunite with your family right?) (Naval)</p><br/><p>(?! Those words\u2026 that is underhanded Naval-dono. \u2026 Which one are you planning on using?) (Wudi)</p><br/><p>(Thanks! Since it is like this, I want to use both. Fighting with the Rose to the bare limit and then finish it with the Death God) (Naval)</p><br/><p>(The\u2026 two. You have resolved yourself up to that point? \u2026 Okay, I will use my all to help you. When given the signal, I will take everyone immediately and show you how I shake off the soldiers at a speed so fast that won\u2019t even let them react to it) (Wudi)</p><br/><p>(So you were already aware of my last request huh. I am grateful. Truly\u2026 grateful) (Naval)</p><br/><p>Taking the chance when she avoids the giant\u2019s attack, Naval moves to the back of where Bredda is positioned in.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, Hibiki, Bredda. I have thought of a trifling plan so, is it okay to leave it to me?\u201d (Naval)</p><br/><p>\u201cNaval! If you are saying this and leaving us two to fight against this monster, it must mean you have quite the confidence right?!\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cMerciless, this lady is merciless!\u201d (Bredda)</p><br/><p>Of course, the two of them spit out complains one after the other. Their faces were filled with expectation, so they were not truly against the idea. Naval smiles at the behavior of both. For the girl that almost never smiles, this was an unusual happening.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust for a bit, I am counting on you guys!\u201d (Naval)</p><br/><p>Naval falls back to the rear where Wudi and Chiya are. Wudi had a strained and resolved expression. Chiya had a pure face filled with motivation. Naval, seeing both of their faces, smiled gently.</p><br/><p>\u201cWudi-dono, please\u201d (Naval)</p><br/><p>She takes out an earth-colored object the size of a coin from the bag hanging at her waist. It was a form that seemed as if the so called \u201cRose of the Desert\u201d had become smaller.</p><br/><p>Next, a single note. It had thickness, and in the material that could make one think it is cloth, a pattern is engraved.</p><br/><p>Seeing the two items taken out, Wudi lowered his brows and sighed deeply. Because the two items were the real deal.</p><br/><p>\u201cU-Uhm! What should I do?\u201d (Chiya)</p><br/><p>Chiya wasn\u2019t able to understand the situation and asked the two people that had faces as if they knew everything.</p><br/><p>Even though she is still young, she is still able to pay attention to the two comrades that have been left to deal with the giant while she talks. Chiya herself still didn\u2019t know but, this is quite the growth.</p><br/><p>Hibiki, knowing her hair was going to get in the way, cut it short. She learned about the sword from Naval and magic from Wudi. Seeing that sister-like existence, Chiya tried her best in her own way for the sake of walking beside that person forever. Continuously experiencing the battlefield, Chiya had grown well.</p><br/><p>\u201cChiya\u2026 is okay. Just concentrate on those two\u201d (Naval)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. Chiya, do your best in providing support to Naval-dono. Cast a strong spell that you won\u2019t need to reapply for a long while\u201d (Wudi)</p><br/><p>\u201cU-Understood!\u201d (Chiya)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 W-Wudi-dono\u201d (Naval)</p><br/><p>\u201cNow then, next is the Rose Sign huh. How are you going to sneak the note on him?\u201d (Wudi)</p><br/><p>\u201cI will coil it around the handle\u201d (Naval)</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s fix it as well. You remember the activation key right?\u201d (Wudi)</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected, that would be no joke. There\u2019s no problem\u201d (Naval)</p><br/><p>Maybe he was trying to soften the mood a bit, the party\u2019s magician smiled and made a light question which was returned with a wry smile.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I wasn\u2019t saying that with the intention of a joke though. If you are heading to a once in a lifetime stage, you must worry about those small things just in case\u201d (Wudi)</p><br/><p>Magic power flows from Wudi\u2019s hand and the earth-colored item that was in Naval\u2019s hand dissolved into a liquid state and gets absorbed inside of her.</p><br/><p>The support magic that was filled with Chiya\u2019s fighting spirit had also finished casting.</p><br/><p>Naval, sensing power flooding her body, her shoulders tremble. In the beginning she thought it was because of the efficacy of Chiya\u2019s support magic, but this power that knows no bounds, ignoring the comfortableness of the user, this violent-like power is not something that this small girl\u2019s magic possesses.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have confirmed the activation. Start\u201d (Wudi)</p><br/><p>The business-like and firm voice of Wudi reaches the ears of Naval. There was no need to tell her, her eyes were already facing the battlefield, at Io.</p><br/><p>Her white hair flows in the wind and the back of her neck is revealed. At both sides of her neck, something was there. The pattern of a crimson-colored rose.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Rose Sign. Something that I didn\u2019t want to see on a friend if possible\u201d (Wudi)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Wudi-dono, this is my wish. Don\u2019t make such a face. Then\u2026 I\u2019m going!\u201d (Naval)</p><br/><p>From the whole body of the running Naval, a dim radiance is being released. In that figure that would normally be seen as beautiful, Wudi looks at it in pain, as if wanting to cry.</p><br/><p>\u201cUhm\u2026 What was the plan?\u201d (Chiya)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s something like the preparations for a sure-kill technique\u201d (Wudi)</p><br/><p>\u201cIncredible! Naval-san could use such a technique?!\u201d (Chiya)</p><br/><p>Seeing the innocent happiness of Chiya, Wudi stops kneading his magic for a bit and looks at the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Yeah. A one-time use\u201d (Wudi)</p><br/><p>He whispers.</p><br/><p>That voice dissolving into the darkness.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

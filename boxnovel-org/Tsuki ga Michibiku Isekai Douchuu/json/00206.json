A hero would be one thing, but for a merchant to be summoned is something I wouldn\u2019t have been able to imagine.\u201d</p><br/><p>A talk with prince Joshua.</p><br/><p>In this place where no other noble is present, I was here alone with her.</p><br/><p>What was reflected in my eyes when I was given permission to enter the room, was the figure of prince Joshua in a simple dress.</p><br/><p>After finishing our remembrance talk about Rotsgard, prince Joshua suddenly brought out such a conversation.</p><br/><p>\u201c?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard it from Hibiki. You are a resident from the same world of Hibiki, and also an acquaintance of hers. Of course, this is only known by me and his Majesty. We haven\u2019t even told the Hopelace household that was together with us in Rotsgard.\u201d (Joshua)</p><br/><p>Information from Hibiki-senpai huh.</p><br/><p>Then it wouldn\u2019t be strange for Joshua to know.</p><br/><p>But for her to talk about such information as well, it seems like there\u2019s proper trust between her and the Limia royal family.</p><br/><p>Because the nobles go to the frontlines frequently, and there\u2019s also the background that the power of the nobles is strong, I had some strange thoughts of it, but it seems like it ended with just being thoughts.</p><br/><p>It was the type that would be better if it ended in needless anxiety, so I am relieved.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom Senpai, I see. Ah it is certainly true that Senpai and I were from the same world. I don\u2019t know how to explain it, so it is a personal history that I haven\u2019t spoke of much though.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Must be. Special cases like Hibiki and the personage in the Empire have their background assured by our God, but Raidou-dono was a sudden happening huh. When I heard the story from Hibiki, I was surprised, and at the same time, I felt respect towards you who became a merchant even after that.\u201d (Joshua)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is not as much as you say.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>It was just that my misfortune turned into fortune.</p><br/><p>The truth is that there\u2019s not much I have achieved myself.</p><br/><p>After saying a relative amount of details that Senpai told her of me, I could tell that prince Joshua doesn\u2019t know much.</p><br/><p>If I were to speak with Hibiki in detail, it would be necessary to explain that the root reason of coming here was because of me and the Misumi household.</p><br/><p>Be it Senpai or Tomoki, they originally shouldn\u2019t have had a trigger to be related to this world.</p><br/><p>And yet, because of me, they were forcefully selected by the Goddess.</p><br/><p>Even if it\u2019s the result from a selection, those two are totally victims.</p><br/><p>In the first place, a decision like abandoning your world isn\u2019t something that can be decided in a short amount of time.</p><br/><p>I decided to do so because of my own circumstances, and yet, I am regretting it even now.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why it is not a certainty if those two would have changed their answers now.</p><br/><p>I do think that one day I have to properly apologize to Senpai and Tomoki, but how am I going to break it? The time where I am just brooding over it continues.</p><br/><p>Because of the matter of Tomoe, it is even harder to talk with Tomoki about it after all.</p><br/><p>It is still easier to tell Senpai, but\u2026hah\u2026</p><br/><p>There\u2019s that matter and I know it is difficult, but if possible, I don\u2019t want to oppose them.</p><br/><p>It is something that Tsukuyomi-sama asked of me, even if it was only moderately.</p><br/><p>How vexing.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt the same time, it allowed me to comprehend that power of yours. When Hibiki came to this world, she had the ability to fight with the leader of the knight division. She said she studied in Nakatsuhara and had learned about a variety of subjects; her knowledge and wisdom was quite the thing as well. In that case, you who have studied in the same place as her, beginning a business when coming to this world isn\u2019t such a strange thing.\u201d (Joshua)</p><br/><p>I feel like she is having an incredible misunderstanding.</p><br/><p>It is beginning to sound as if high school is an incredible place.</p><br/><p>Also, it would be very troublesome to talk with Senpai as the standard.</p><br/><p>I am one year younger than her, and if asked if I can become like Senpai, I would have to say I can\u2019t.</p><br/><p>Even if I were to try for my whole life, I think it would be impossible.</p><br/><p>In the first place, for a high schooler to begin a business is something obvious? Just what\u2019s Senpai?</p><br/><p>\u201cHibiki-senpai was a special and exemplary person even within the people in our world. I am way inferior compared to her. And when talking about the business, it would be one thing to finish the test of the guild, but in practice, I am being hindered by my own inexperience, and there are a lot of things that don\u2019t go well for me, that\u2019s why, I don\u2019t have the ability that Joshua-sama thinks I have.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cHibiki evaluated you pretty high, you know? She even said that there\u2019s no one as reliable to have at one\u2019s side than you, and that surprised his Majesty. I have heard that there\u2019s the need to study a long time before being able to do the Merchant Guild test. And yet, you were able to call the test \u2018one thing\u2019, that must mean that even if Raidou-dono himself doesn\u2019t notice, you are an exemplary person.\u201d (Joshua)</p><br/><p>\u2026I think that the gaze of Hibiki was directed at Mio and Beren when she said that.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t think she has noticed that it was us in Limia, and she doesn\u2019t know that I was the one who defeated the purple cloud either, so I can\u2019t think of a reason as to why she would evaluate me so highly.</p><br/><p>Even if it\u2019s Senpai, she shouldn\u2019t have the foundations to evaluate me that high.</p><br/><p>I am aware that I am incredibly blessed in talented people after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhaha, when you say it like that it scares me. Right, speaking of surprise, your Joshua-sama\u2019s attire has surprised me. As expected, when you are indoors, you dress normally huh.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026No, even when I am indoors, I normally don\u2019t dress this way. It\u2019s been awhile since I have released myself from crossdressing.\u201d (Joshua)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, is that so.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cRight now this room is being paid attention to in a lot of ways, so there\u2019s the point that there\u2019s no worries of the inside being peeked, and the guest that I was receiving is you, which serves as a big reason.\u201d (Joshua)</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it because I already know of the circumstances?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. It would have been fine if that was only a hobby of mine, but\u2026\u201d (Joshua)</p><br/><p>\u201cAs I thought, that\u2019s not the case.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cMe crossdressing is not something that I do because I like to. For me, it is nothing but a mean. It is something that if necessary, I won\u2019t hesitate in doing, but if there\u2019s no need to, I would prefer not doing it.\u201d (Joshua)</p><br/><p>\u201cA mean\u2026 It sounds complicated.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Even so, I don\u2019t want to stick my nose in that, so I decided to just leave a vague response.</p><br/><p>Whether the crossdressing is a hobby or a mean, I don\u2019t have much interest in it.</p><br/><p>If this will only steer unnecessary trouble, I would prefer to change the topic.</p><br/><p>Well, I was trying to avert from the topic of Japan, and in the end, I ended up in a conversation that doesn\u2019t have a good air, so my thinking was the shallow one.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s be careful\u2026at least.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn terms of feeling at home, this way feels more comfortable. And that\u2019s why a part of me has used you in order to be dressed in this way. Please forgive me.\u201d (Joshua)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo no, if it is only for this much, you can freely use me. Ehm, the normal gallant prince Joshua is lovely, but I think that the relaxed Joshua-sama is also beautiful.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I go for a compliment.</p><br/><p>In Limia, there\u2019s a lot of moments when compliments are necessary, so I have been taught a few of what they said I should remember, and I have now used some.</p><br/><p>In the talk with the nobles, it was a barrage of questions, so I didn\u2019t have much chances to use it.</p><br/><p>Prince Joshua in his female appearance won\u2019t be that noisy about it, so it is the perfect person to use them.</p><br/><p>\u201cUse those kind of compliments when you are at parties, or nobles that boast their wife. It is necessary for you to first learn how to say it in a more natural manner though. Ehm, in other words, it is out of the question.\u201d (Joshua)</p><br/><p>So she has said \u2018ehm\u2019 huh.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s bad.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, sorry. I am just not used to say that. Because you are an acquaintance, I ended up trying it.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I am still this country\u2019s prince, you know?\u201d (Joshua)</p><br/><p>A slight silence is created with prince Joshua making a complicated expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are in that appearance, so I thought that maybe it is fine to not mind about social status at this moment.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Since she is not meeting me as a prince, that means this matter is not about the country after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to be enough, but you do have a relative amount of ability to make plans, so what\u2019s needed is to pay attention to the other party\u2019s feelings as well.\u201d (Joshua)</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh, that\u2019s a harsh evaluation.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>It was kinda soft, but I feel like she was basically telling me I was showing my uselessness.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd it seems like Raidou-dono doesn\u2019t understand completely the reason why I am dressed this way. Hibiki is good at reading this kind of things, so I was unconsciously expecting that of you.\u201d (Joshua)</p><br/><p>The reason she is dressed this way?</p><br/><p>The security of this room is reliable, and since I already know her circumstances, I thought she just wanted to relax.</p><br/><p>Prince Joshua herself said so.</p><br/><p>Prince Joshua waited for my words for a while, and after letting out a short troubled sigh, she looked at my eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cRaidou-dono, you have learned of my secret.\u201d (Joshua)</p><br/><p>\u201cY-Yes.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd then, I asked you to keep it a secret and returned to my country.\u201d (Joshua)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What\u2019s happening?</p><br/><p>Confirming the obvious, we once again fell into silence.</p><br/><p>It is certainly true that I learned of prince Joshua being a woman, and after being asked to keep it a secret, we have met again like this in Limia, but\u2026</p><br/><p>What about it?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Hibiki told me that Raidou-dono is not someone that would plan a conspiracy, but I see, she referred to this huh. I now understand why when she was talking about Kuzunoha Company, she corrected herself and spoke of Raidou-dono himself.\u201d (Joshua)</p><br/><p>\u201cE-Ehm\u2026\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cAt that time, I was unable to give any clear collateral to Raidou-dono, and didn\u2019t even give anything like a deposit; the only thing I did was say some vague things. Then, how do you think I thought of Raidou-dono?\u201d (Joshua)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat you wanted to quickly present a collateral and be done with it, maybe?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d (Joshua)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe capital was made a mess and it was no time for this, maybe?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s something that deviates from the preamble of \u2018what I thought of Raidou-dono\u2019.\u201d (Joshua)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s true.</p><br/><p>But, something that prince Joshua thought of me.</p><br/><p>It isn\u2019t a collateral.</p><br/><p>Even so, there hasn\u2019t been so many thought transmissions lately.</p><br/><p>I thought that maybe it was because the reconstruction was hard work.</p><br/><p>When I met with Hibiki-senpai before, she didn\u2019t say anything about it though.</p><br/><p>Hm\u2026then what would she think?</p><br/><p>If it were me, regarding a faraway person that has learned of something that\u2019s bad to be known and have only done some simple secret keeping\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u2026I would definitely be uneasy.</p><br/><p>Depending on the situation, I probably would want to eliminate that person as fast as possible.</p><br/><p>But there wasn\u2019t a single assassin from Limia.</p><br/><p>Then, investigate?</p><br/><p>To learn if that person has told anyone else about it.</p><br/><p>There weren\u2019t reports of that either though.</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s not this, I am out of ideas.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, you were uneasy, so you wanted to know of the person\u2019s movements?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. And from what I could tell, you haven\u2019t disclosed my secret. You haven\u2019t used it as a figurative talk either.\u201d (Joshua)</p><br/><p>So she was really checking us huh.</p><br/><p>What method did she use?</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t hear anything from my guys though.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, and in truth, I haven\u2019t told anyone.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>She did tell me not to tell anyone, and something like the secret of the second prince of Limia has no way of use for me.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I will trust you from now on. With that meaning in mind, I showed myself in this appearance.\u201d (Joshua)</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be, I was being suspected quite a lot?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s kind of\u2026shocking.</p><br/><p>The royal family that has been living a sheltered life even within the hyumans, that\u2019s something\u2026</p><br/><p>In the case of this person, it feels like it would be possible, but even so.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me ask you back, why would I be able to trust you? A merchant that I suddenly met in Rotsgard and know nothing of his personal history.\u201d (Joshua)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s certainly suspicious.</p><br/><p>Even if I don\u2019t have the intentions to, it is natural from the viewpoint of the other party.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt that time, I even estimated that my ruin would be coming. To the point that I even thought about how to dispose of my body so that it won\u2019t cause problems for his Majesty. But you didn\u2019t seem to have disclosed it, and there were no actions towards me with the knowledge you had.\u201d (Joshua)</p><br/><p>Disposing of her body, she means suicide?</p><br/><p>That\u2019s scary.</p><br/><p>\u201cLike I said, I haven\u2019t told anyone.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Saying it in a slightly hard manner, I return the same response.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t even tell the people of Asora, or more like, I forgot about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is the secret of a second prince. Depending on how it is used, it is a suitable ingredient to increase your position as a merchant to one or two steps higher. To utilize it in some way is natural and logical for a merchant.\u201d (Joshua)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ah, so that\u2019s why.</p><br/><p>They did ask me things like: \u2018Do you have any plans in having a business in Limia?\u2019 or \u2018Don\u2019t you have anything you wish as an accommodation for what happened before?\u2019.</p><br/><p>I remember those thought transmissions I got before coming here.</p><br/><p>\u2018I currently don\u2019t have any plans of opening a store in Limia, so please don\u2019t mind it and concentrate in the reconstruction\u2019, is what I always answered every time it happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot only did you not utilize this secret, you didn\u2019t even speak to the nobles, and you don\u2019t have plans on opening a store in Limia; this, I have confirmed. Honestly, it is a hard to believe answer.\u201d (Joshua)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is also because of the lack of personnel, but there\u2019s a lot of circumstances going on in Kuzunoha Company, so we can\u2019t increase the amount of stores that readily.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>To tell the truth, I have a fe~w of my people doing peddling in Limia, but it is not to the point of making a store.</p><br/><p>I was thinking about telling them this in our stay in Limia, but in terms of a store\u2026 Ah, right.</p><br/><p>In that case, there\u2019s the method of revealing it to prince Joshua and have her convince the nobles so they don\u2019t go clamouring.</p><br/><p>\u201cI went further into thinking that you were different from a merchant, for example; a military personnel or a person that has ties with a noble, and that increased my caution even more. But after hearing Hibiki\u2019s story and your own talk, it seems like everything was just my own imagination going wild.\u201d (Joshua)</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout that, there\u2019s something that I was planning on saying in time, so I was thinking about telling Joshua-sama first.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026It feels like you just thought of it though, but well, tell me.\u201d (Joshua)</p><br/><p>This is something that I have been thinking on who I should tell in the time I am in Limia.</p><br/><p>It is just that I didn\u2019t think I would be telling this to prince Joshua at this moment.</p><br/><p>The topic itself is not something that I thought of just now.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the Kuzunoha Company, there\u2019s something like an out-of-store sales, or more like a peddling unit. There\u2019s the fact that the unit has been doing business in a small part of the settlements in Limia, and in a small scale.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cHm\u2026 I didn\u2019t get reports of it, but I see.\u201d (Joshua)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is probably not in the direct jurisdiction of the royal family, but I have received reports that we have done several transactions specially close to the borders in the territory of nobles.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d (Joshua)</p><br/><p>\u201cI was thinking about obtaining the consent of the royal family and the nobles.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you asking me to help you convince them?\u201d (Joshua)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf needed, I will also give you the reports of the sales and pay for the taxes as well, so please.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>The transactions don\u2019t deal with big amounts of gold, so even if we talk about taxes, it shouldn\u2019t be that big of a deal. Probably.</p><br/><p>If necessary, I should investigate about the tax of Limia.</p><br/><p>Prince Joshua makes a thinking expression for a while.</p><br/><p>The time she was thinking was a lot shorter than the times she showed me a complex expression, and then, she returned her gaze to me.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026If it\u2019s that much, there\u2019s no problem. It also depends on the amount of money, but I will manage the part of the tax. I promise.\u201d (Joshua)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat will help a lot.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cAt the reception, no, in the conversations a few moments ago, there were a lot of people wishing for Kuzunoha Company to open a store, right? There were people that didn\u2019t say anything, but there were few who were opposed.\u201d (Joshua)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, now that you mention it, yeah.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if there are people that wish for you to increase the scope of your business, there\u2019s most likely none who would actively ostrice you. Just in case, can you tell me the settlements that you know of have been in those business of yours?\u201d (Joshua)</p><br/><p>Saying that, prince Joshua stands up from his seat and takes out a map of Limia kingdom from the shelf.</p><br/><p>Just that it was quite a rough map.</p><br/><p>I can tell the territories, but I can\u2019t tell the insides that well. It was close to being a blank map.</p><br/><p>Only a few major points were drawn, and the paths were sparse.</p><br/><p>Are the normal maps like this?</p><br/><p>It is quite different from the one we normally use.</p><br/><p>For now I just say ok, and point out the position of the settlements I have received reports of.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s around 20 places.</p><br/><p>If we include the villages they have gone to only once or have only seen, the numbers would increase by a lot, so I have only mentioned the villages that we have done trades with and the name of Kuzunoha Company has resonated.</p><br/><p>Depending on the medicine selling of the Kuzunoha Company, I mean, the peddling, some people have begun calling the Forest Onis with a sad nickname like \u2018Kuzu-san\u2019 .</p><br/><p>They are probably being called \u2018Kuzu-san\u2019 by the innocent kids and the elders that are enjoying their retired life. Honestly, that\u2019s quite the psychological attack.</p><br/><p>And in truth, when they learned of it, they were quite down.</p><br/><p>I have heard a few times that the village heads wants to meet me, but I didn\u2019t want to be called the boss of Kuzu-san, or the representative of Kuzu, so I haven\u2019t gone to any of those places.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite the number. But it looks like the number is higher in the west side.\u201d (Joshua)</p><br/><p>Prince Joshua writes down the places that I point out.</p><br/><p>As a result, from the west side of Limia\u2019s national border to the south of it had been marked here and there.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like at the west side there\u2019s a lot of poor villages, so our people bring them goods often.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Why? In poor villages, they won\u2019t be able to provide you the money, right?\u201d (Joshua)</p><br/><p>Prince Joshua tilts her head.</p><br/><p>Did I say something strange?</p><br/><p>It is not like our place is selling high-class items though.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut in poor villages, the people will need goods, right?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>We are only selling everyday goods and household medicine in places that are in need of those.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t think that\u2019s strange.</p><br/><p>\u201cEhm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>It seems like prince Joshua frequently shows this kind of expression and stiffens up in silence.</p><br/><p>It feels like she is bewildered because of meeting a mysterious being, or like she is surprised by it.</p><br/><p>As I am not a rare animal, I am a bit sad about it.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026No, it is true that if you are going through this kind of villages as your focus, it is understandable that the reports of the feudal lords are coming late. This is still something that hasn\u2019t been confirmed, but I will think of a method so that Kuzunoha Company can move more freely in the Limia territory. It is something that can be done since it is only on the scale of peddling after all.\u201d (Joshua)</p><br/><p>\u201cEasier to move\u2026Like giving us a transition pass, or something like that?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Like the time in the demon race territory.</p><br/><p>\u201cA transition pass huh. A passage permission for the highway, permission for peddling inside the country; I still don\u2019t know what kind of form it will take. Just that, I will lend you my strength as thanks for protecting my secret.\u201d (Joshua)</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way, what other plans do you have here, Raidou-dono?\u201d (Joshua)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, an acquaintance of mine requested me of something, so I was thinking about going out for around half a day.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Tomorrow and the day after tomorrow there\u2019s a lot of blank time.</p><br/><p>To the point that if I were to move the plans of tomorrow to the day after, I would have one whole free day.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo where?\u201d (Joshua)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe lake.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Seiko? At that place there\u2019s a lot of people going for sightseeing, and it is close to the capital.\u201d (Joshua)</p><br/><p>Yeah, I did hear about that.</p><br/><p>A big lake at the vicinities of Limia that was created by the Devil, or so to say, me.</p><br/><p>It is receiving a relatively good amount of sightseers, and in terms of practical use, they have been receiving resources from the lake or something like that.</p><br/><p>If I were asked if I wanted to go there, as expected, I would have to shake my head sideways.</p><br/><p>No way I would want to go there.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it is the Meiris lake. I heard that it is a famous place in the Limia kingdom.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>The place that Root told me is that.</p><br/><p>I am grateful that it isn\u2019t that far away.</p><br/><p>Moreover, it seems like it isn\u2019t as heavily managed like the desert of Gritonia.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeiris\u2026 It is certainly true that it is famous, but didn\u2019t your acquaintance make a mistake in the place or something?\u201d (Joshua)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I am sure that person said Meiris. He said that the entrance isn\u2019t prohibited though. Is that not the case?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. This lake is famous, and as long as we confirm the need to enter, there\u2019s no prohibition in entering.\u201d (Joshua)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>A part of me was internally nervous that maybe Root was trying to create more trouble again.</p><br/><p>I remember the face of that guy that said: \u2018My joints still hurt\u2019, as he gave me the egg.</p><br/><p>It was an aloof smile that as always, I couldn\u2019t tell what he was thinking.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust that it is dangerous. It is a lake where a superior dragon and the kingdom had an agreement. It would be one thing if it\u2019s people that are going there to test their strength or take the trials, but Raidou-dono is someone that our country has invited, and our side would prefer if you didn\u2019t go to such a dangerous place.\u201d (Joshua)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I see.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Now that I think about it, the Gritonia desert was supposed to be a dangerous place as well.</p><br/><p>It was a beautiful place, and since I was easily able to pass, I forgot about it.</p><br/><p>Is this place also considered relatively dangerous as well?</p><br/><p>\u2018It is opened to the public and there\u2019s a beautiful lake shore, so go and have a walk around the lake when you return\u2019, is what Root told me though.</p><br/><p>In that case, I will have to think of a way to stealthily leave this place again huh.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will tell his Majesty, but please don\u2019t expect much. If it can\u2019t be granted, I still have a few places I want to guide you to.\u201d (Joshua)</p><br/><p>\u201cI am counting on you.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>It is an answer that feels like it won\u2019t work.</p><br/><p>If I say I will be bringing Mio, will it work?</p><br/><p>It is fine if it is Lime.</p><br/><p>Senpai knows of his skills, so maybe I can have her give her word as well.</p><br/><p>After that, we did casual talk and talked about the state of the business, and with nothing special happening, the talk ended.</p><br/><p>I could tell her about the Forest Onis selling medicine, and have heard a positive answer for this.</p><br/><p>For me, it was a beneficial meeting.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6</p><br/><p>Joshua thought that he was a troublesome person.</p><br/><p>It was a truly frank evaluation.</p><br/><p>This was practically the first time Joshua had talked with Raidou properly, but she felt like he was completely different from what she imagined him to be.</p><br/><p>(Even though it was a verbal promise, he acted as if he had formed some sort of contract. That\u2019s something for me to be happy about, but turning it around, it would also mean that for him, verbal promises are as strong as official contracts.) (Joshua)</p><br/><p>A deceptive promise might become an unexpected restrain.</p><br/><p>For Raidou, there\u2019s the need of a different standard in negotiations. Thinking this, a sigh unconsciously came out from Joshua.</p><br/><p>(Also, his way of thinking when doing business. Even when compared to Hibiki, he is way too incomprehensible. His speech, tone, and expressions, it made me feel as if he was doing charity work or something. I do think that there\u2019s something wrong in me for thinking that way, but it throws me off.) (Joshua)</p><br/><p>Raidou didn\u2019t use her secret to threaten her.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t ask for advantages in his business either.</p><br/><p>The only thing he asked for was to give consent for the small scale peddling he did.</p><br/><p>Even that, Joshua was doubting if he actually thought of it in advance before asking her.</p><br/><p>(\u2026No good. The information is way too limited, it would be better to just leave it like that. He is from the same world as Hibiki, moreover, someone that was studying at the same learning facility. I don\u2019t think he is just an ordinary person. It is also a mystery as to why he wants to go to Meiris instead of Seiko. If possible, I would want to observe him with a subordinate of my own, but I wonder\u2026) (Joshua)</p><br/><p>He is not someone that can be left alone.</p><br/><p>At that point, Hibiki, the Limia king, and prince Joshua are of the same opinion.</p><br/><p>There was confusion after actually meeting him and talking with him, but Joshua\u2019s root way of thinking had not changed.</p><br/><p>The highly efficient personnel of Raidou, and the rare ability of his Company.</p><br/><p>And also the ability of the students he taught that can overturn common sense.</p><br/><p>All of those points are things that they are unwilling to \u2018give to other countries\u2019.</p><br/><p>Especially Gritonia, if it were to go there, the balance in countries would crumble.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why, for Joshua, no matter where she looked, Raidou was\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a troublesome person Raidou-dono is.\u201d (Joshua)</p><br/><p>Being in the middle of its reconstruction and still calling him in a hurry, does mean that Limia has ulterior motives.</p><br/><p>From the royal family, Joshua and the King.</p><br/><p>The hero Hibiki.</p><br/><p>A number of quick witted nobles.</p><br/><p>Right now they are still being docile, but Joshua expects that the merchants will be moving as well.</p><br/><p>Tomorrow she will be dealing with those people, and moreover, she is thinking about showing him the current capital.</p><br/><p>She filled her free time with things that had somewhat of an objective.</p><br/><p>But if Raidou has a different request from that, even if the chances are low, she has no choice but to take it into consideration.</p><br/><p>That request of his was also something that troubled her, and made her want to groan.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6</p><br/><p>At the welcoming banquet, I was made to drink quite a lot, but my waking was pretty pleasant.</p><br/><p>I conversed a bit with Senpai and her group, and the nobles asked me to try doing business in their areas no matter the scale.</p><br/><p>His Majesty told me that he was anxious about the reconstruction of the city.</p><br/><p>Once the support unit that went to Rotsgard returns, the reconstruction speed should increase, and there\u2019s good materials as well, but as expected, since it is winter, there\u2019s probably going to be more damage coming which made his Majesty feel depressed.</p><br/><p>It won\u2019t be like Asora that has summer tomorrow.</p><br/><p>In this one point, the demon race got them good huh.</p><br/><p>And in truth, if you just do one step to the big street, you can see that the situation is like that of ruins, and at the outside of the reconstructed outer walls, there\u2019s still a lot of camps.</p><br/><p>For me, it looked like the reconstruction of the capital was only beginning.</p><br/><p>I am not unsensitive enough to say something like that to the people that are happy that it has advanced quite a lot, so I zipped my mouth though.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I will guide Raidou-dono. Even if it costs me my life, I will assure you a safe journey. Please don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>The journey to Meiris that I requested of prince Joshua yesterday has been granted in a strange form.</p><br/><p>With the minimum amount of luggage, I was carrying the bag with the dragon egg, and in my front, there\u2019s Senpai who is completely armed.</p><br/><p>Those words just now were something that she directed to the Limia people, Mio, and Lime.</p><br/><p>It seems like my going to the Meiris Lake has been approved, if I have the hero Hibiki go with me.</p><br/><p>The talk was made confidentially within a limited few and approved, so there are people that have puzzled faces seeing us two going to the lake.</p><br/><p>Or more like, I am also bewildered.</p><br/><p>Not even in Japan I had a chance to be alone with Senpai, but this is the second time already, counting the time when we were at the room of the company.</p><br/><p>I was incredibly bothered by Mio, but she had shockingly accepted it and stepped back easily.</p><br/><p>She is definitely plotting something.</p><br/><p>She even made a Root-like laugh.</p><br/><p>Root laugh.</p><br/><p>Actually, the one protesting was someone from the hero\u2019s party.</p><br/><p>It is a warrior-looking person.</p><br/><p>If I remember correctly, it is Prince-sama.</p><br/><p>If I am going to be resented(well, I can just separate from them in the middle), I don\u2019t have any problems in having him accompany us though. But in the end, because of the shout of the King-sama, he gave up.</p><br/><p>Even so, the priestess is not here.</p><br/><p>She hasn\u2019t opened her eyes yet?</p><br/><p>Or could it be that she is feeling unwell and can\u2019t come?</p><br/><p>It is worrying since Mio is going to be staying.</p><br/><p>When I return, I will ask about her state again.</p><br/><p>Mio is persistent in saying that she didn\u2019t do anything, and it didn\u2019t feel like she was lying.</p><br/><p>But if Mio really didn\u2019t do anything, I don\u2019t think the priestess would turn that way after looking at her and I.</p><br/><p>It is true that I am ugly by this world\u2019s standards, but even the first villager that I met in the wasteland only screamed and did a rocket dash.</p><br/><p>\u2026Only, huh.</p><br/><p>No, let\u2019s not think about that.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why, even if the concealment of Sakai didn\u2019t work and she was able to see the Magic Armor, I don\u2019t think the priestess of the hero party that has experienced many things would faint because of it.</p><br/><p>Just remembering it hurts.</p><br/><p>At first, the Priestess-san looked dumbfounded, with an expression different from all the other expressions that were shown towards me.</p><br/><p>When I looked back at her thinking it was a unique reaction, after a bit, she looked as if she had noticed something and opened her eyes really wide, her whole body trembling, and then, she went \u2018kyaaa\u2019 and falls.</p><br/><p>Ah, it was shocking.</p><br/><p>Even if it\u2019s as Mio says and the Priestess-san actually did something, I want to know the circumstances.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave a safe trip, Waka-sama. If the Hero-sama is with you, I don\u2019t have anything to worry about-desu wa.\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful. Uhm, please leave the matters here to us.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>Lime seems like he wants to say something.</p><br/><p>Even if he says to leave the matters to them, I know that it will be hard for him to hold back Mio.</p><br/><p>Well, they will be guided by Joshua-sama and a number of retainers to the areas close to the castle.</p><br/><p>If they just take care in that aspect, it will probably be okay.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will be going. Make sure not to trouble Joshua-sama and the people of Limia, okay? If anything happens, I will leave the decision to you two, just that, try not to obstruct the reconstruction work.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if it costs me my life.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>Hahaha.</p><br/><p>Lime is imitating Hibiki-senpai. Even if you do that now, it isn\u2019t funny.</p><br/><p>He even has a strangely serious expression too.</p><br/><p>When I finish today\u2019s delivery, even if I pass the time being washed around by the other party, there won\u2019t be any problems in Limia.</p><br/><p>I was unexpectedly able to speak with Senpai today so, how to say it, Limia is working well.</p><br/><p>It feels like it will be more comfortable than the other tours in the foreign countries.</p><br/><p>On our journey and at our arrival, there still hasn\u2019t been any unreasonable happening since coming here.</p><br/><p>Gritonia is a major power as well, and since I had a preconceived notion that the nobles were oppressive, I probably misunderstood Limia.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, let\u2019s go Raidou-dono.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cI am counting on you today, Hibiki-sama.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I thought that it would be bad to call Hibiki with -senpai, so I tried using -sama instead.</p><br/><p>Senpai didn\u2019t seem to mind me changing my way of addressing her, she just nodded lightly and rode her horse first and began moving towards the Meiris Lake.</p><br/><p>I turn around once to Mio who was waving at me, and then, I quickly follow after Senpai.</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s Senpai, she will probably let me go alone if I just tell her the circumstances.</p><br/><p>Now that I think about it, things like: \u2018Give me that person\u2019 and \u2018Show me your power\u2019, happened at Gritonia, and reminds me that I had gone to a problematic country.</p><br/><p>It is one of the few tasks I have to do in Limia, so let\u2019s quickly deliver this egg.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He worries more about their growth and future than me after all.</p><br/><p>And there\u2019s no way that Shiki is completely unrelated to Jin and the others being here.</p><br/><p>Aah~, this is bothering me.</p><br/><p>This is not good. I have already decided on what to do, and yet, I am feeling so uneasy.</p><br/><p>Hm, eliminating the threats comes first.</p><br/><p>\u201cRai\u2026dou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the 14 people there noticed me who had suddenly appeared inside their formation.</p><br/><p>A merciless bloodthirst was directed at me all at once.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it were in the Empire, I wouldn\u2019t complain about your situation, but you know, this is Lorel Union, a country that\u2019s not yours.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>It is true that the bloodthirst is sharp and strong, fitting of their level. But today, I have already been bathed in bloodthirst that\u2019s on a whole other level.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s do it in the same way as the Shadowless before, and instantly\u2014-ah.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuh!!\u201d</p><br/><p>I was about to crush the head of the handsome youth, that made a sharp slash at me, by using the Magic Armor, but at that moment, I noticed. This might become a repeat from last time.</p><br/><p>It is the factor that the gruesomeness of the corpses might swell up hatred.</p><br/><p>As long as we are fighting for our lives in the battlefield, it is natural for one side or the other to die as a conclusion. But there are times when the way of doing it is important as well.</p><br/><p>It would be another case if we were to wipe them all out, but it is especially true when there\u2019s witnesses and there\u2019s the need to protect them.</p><br/><p>In the first place, this time, there\u2019s enemies that killing would be the wrong answer.</p><br/><p>I have absolutely no intentions of having a war with Lorel. But depending on how I deal with this, there\u2019s the chance that it might become unavoidable.</p><br/><p>The way I got rid of the Shadowless, and the one before that\u2026the matter with Illumgand as well.</p><br/><p>My uneasiness has numbed my thoughts in a nice way.</p><br/><p>This is a good opportunity.</p><br/><p>\u201cSilver One, [Lapushka]\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I stop going arialess and purposely mixed an aria and form a spell by manifesting magic power.</p><br/><p>\u201cFall back!! An enhancement spell; the activation time is bizarrely fast!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c!!\u201d</p><br/><p>With the aria that surpasses by a bit the 5 seconds, it is enough for the enemy to know the type of spell.</p><br/><p>From the index finger and middle finger I extended, a magic power needle that is slightly shorter and narrower than a dagger appeared.</p><br/><p>I will leave the Magic Armor to rest in this occasion and just keep it at covering my body.</p><br/><p>And then, seeing the equipment and outfit of the man in front of me, I decided on how to deal with him.</p><br/><p>I grab the blade of the katana with my left hand and deviate its trajectory, and just like that, I pull the katana and him onto me.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave a good night.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c!!!! Tomo\u2026ki-sama\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I pierce the needle into the neck of the man that even though he is a man has quite the beautiful neck.</p><br/><p>Instant death? No no, ain\u2019t that a bit too rash there, Boss?</p><br/><p>Wait, why did I say that in the tone of Lime? </p><br/><p>Well, there\u2019s no problem at all. I just used a spell that easily creates people in a state of apparent death. By the way, I was taught this by Mio.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know what type of spell it is, but it is a mysterious spell that I can tell from its aria that it is different from normal.</p><br/><p>When I separate my left hand, the magic needle was still pierced in his neck, and the handsome boy fell onto the ground. He is not moving at all.</p><br/><p>A similar needle extends from my two fingers again.</p><br/><p>It looks like the people that have been affected by the charm of Tomoki have all been equally sent to the battlefield, but their original positions are definitely not equal. There\u2019s probably big-shots in that group of people and people connected with big-shots.</p><br/><p>In that case, we leave them on the verge of death, and later, have Tomoe inspect them to decide what we should do.</p><br/><p>If the needle is taken out just like that, they would die, but well, if that happens, let\u2019s just leave it as being their bad luck.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think that \u2018the current you\u2019 are hopeless beyond salvation. But, even so, if people out there wish for you guys to keep on living, for today\u2026I am thinking about leaving them that chance to. My apologies.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>There\u2019s 13 remaining.</p><br/><p>The highest leveled one is around 400.</p><br/><p>For now, I will make sure they don\u2019t die while properly gauging their danger.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s hurry.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, there\u2019s no assurance you will survive. Even if we were to take just one of the enemies, they are all higher than any of you guys here. Not only that, this is a true battlefield where you don\u2019t know what will happen at each passing second. Izumo, you are prepared for that, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d (Izumo)</p><br/><p>An immediate response.</p><br/><p>Being told about the incident occurring in the second biggest city of Lorel Union, Kannaoi, I didn\u2019t hold any hesitation.</p><br/><p>High level adventurers and influential nobles all know that any citizen would want to stay in the Chihiro Manrai restaurant, and this high-class restaurant has received a night assault.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s Raidou-sensei at that place and there\u2019s also his aides.</p><br/><p>No matter what happens, I feel like the city will be okay.</p><br/><p>But\u2026right now, at that place, there\u2019s princess Iroha.</p><br/><p>I heard that the insurgents are aiming for her.</p><br/><p>Even so, if asked if I had to go there, that\u2019s not the case. There\u2019s already fighting forces here that I wouldn\u2019t even be able to lift a finger against after all.</p><br/><p>But she is my fiancee.</p><br/><p>I have only met her a few times. I can\u2019t properly imagine what she looks like right now, but I can tell how she is from her letters.</p><br/><p>It is certain that I hold warm feelings mixed with admiration towards her.</p><br/><p>Of course, we are not in a sexual relationship. The princess is still young after all.</p><br/><p>If asked whether this is love that is directed to the opposite sex, I wouldn\u2019t be able to tell.</p><br/><p>I simply want to be by her side and protect her.</p><br/><p>I want to be the one to protect her.</p><br/><p>I want to eliminate the dangers that approach her.</p><br/><p>Once I heard about the situation from Shiki-san, I naturally thought of this.</p><br/><p>I was thinking about meeting her in a not so far future.</p><br/><p>Whether it is my dream, or to fulfill my duty of joining the princess of Kannaoi; I want to have a talk until we can reach an understanding, and then\u2026no matter what kind of result it brings forth, I won\u2019t allow the very chance of even having a conversation to be lost.</p><br/><p>No matter how strong Sensei is, I don\u2019t want to leave it all to him.</p><br/><p>Sensei refused to let me accompany him, but right now, what I want to do is clear.</p><br/><p>The current me has experience living in the Academy. I have increased my level to a decent degree. I have a clear oath, a clear conviction that I didn\u2019t have in the past.</p><br/><p>I have to go.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a nice face you have there, Izumo. Everyone else as well. I will say it with confidence here. Once you return alive from this, you will have completely surpassed the power of a student. You might even obtain a big step that will connect to what\u2019s further ahead. Well then, go. Make sure not to forget greeting Waka-sama.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Several voices overlap.</p><br/><p>I wonder what kind of expression I have right now.</p><br/><p>At the very least, I haven\u2019t felt this fresh since the time I understood the concept of the movement aria and began to apply it.</p><br/><p>This is the second time in my life.</p><br/><p>Shiki-san holds his staff in both hands and draws a circle.</p><br/><p>As always, there\u2019s no aria.</p><br/><p>The inside of the drawn circle had white dense mist coming out from it.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, the current Izumo-kun is truly cool. If you didn\u2019t have a fiancee, I might have fallen for you.\u201d (Yuno)</p><br/><p>Yuno gives me a praise that I couldn\u2019t tell if she was joking or being serious.</p><br/><p>As she is always saying that if she were to marry someone, she has to be the number one or she doesn\u2019t want to, it must be a joke.</p><br/><p>If it were a marriage with the second daughter of a merchant, there\u2019s the possibility, but it is most likely impossibile for her to become my first wife.</p><br/><p>Also, the Rembrandt Company is definitely not a simple wealthy merchant company.</p><br/><p>I look around.</p><br/><p>Jin, Amelia, Misura, Daena, Sif, and Yuno; the first comrades I can rely with this life of mine that has always been living dryly all this time.</p><br/><p>I was thinking about going alone to Kannaoi, but they said they will be coming along as if natural. They are the best friends I could have.</p><br/><p>Even when Shiki-san has told them about the danger, their decision still didn\u2019t change.</p><br/><p>If I didn\u2019t know what laid ahead of this mist was a battlefield, I definitely would have been crying.</p><br/><p>I readied myself and wear the amulet that Shiki-san distributed to everyone. An equipment that he told us not to take off no matter what.</p><br/><p>Now, let\u2019s go.</p><br/><p>I stand at the front and step into the mist.</p><br/><p>We didn\u2019t walk through a mist corridor, I simply saw the nostalgic buildings of Lorel. At that place, there\u2019s the one working at Kuzunoha Company, Lime-san, and one girl I have never seen before.</p><br/><p>And also\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIzumo-sama?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess Iroha.\u201d (Izumo)</p><br/><p>There were several people who had the clothing of Lorel.</p><br/><p>We both called out each other\u2019s name.</p><br/><p>From behind me, I heard the voice of Yuno saying: \u2018thanks for the meal~\u2019, but I ignore it. And after that, I also heard a blunt sound followed by an \u2018Ouch, that hurts Onee-chan!\u2019, but I also ignore that one.</p><br/><p>Good grief, do these kind of things really happen?</p><br/><p>We both shouldn\u2019t know how we look, and yet, we both were able to know who each other was the moment our eyes met.</p><br/><p>If my dream, the happiness of this person, my duties of the household, and the many obligations I have, all connect with each other, there would be nothing as blissful as that.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After calling her name, I was filled with so much emotion that I couldn\u2019t bring out any words.</p><br/><p>Ah, I love this girl.</p><br/><p>I have never felt like this in Academy Town.</p><br/><p>I can clearly declare this.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, so it was Izumo huh. And Jin and the others as well. I have heard about the \u2018circumstances\u2019. Nice to see you here. Welcome to the battlefield.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201cLime-san.\u201d (Izumo)</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, but leave the romantic reunion for later. We don\u2019t have much leisure of time. We will be escaping this place as soon as possible and leave the city. And the highest priority is to regroup with Boss \u2013Raidou-sama.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201cY-Yes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJin, I heard you just came out from sickbed, but this is a decision you made. Since you have come, you will have to show results.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I know.\u201d (Jin)</p><br/><p>Jin replies to the instructions in my stead.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t come out for a while since the time he got injured, but I wonder what happened. Jin has not told us yet. But the resolve that lies in those eyes, there\u2019s no doubt that he has become stronger than before.</p><br/><p>\u2026Compared to that\u2026what am I even doing?</p><br/><p>For an instant, I forgot completely about what kind of situation we are in.</p><br/><p>Right.</p><br/><p>I will protect princess Iroha. Even if my ability is poor, I came here in order to protect her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have heard plenty about you guys\u2019 strength from Brother Shiki. Let\u2019s wrap up the self-introductions while we are escaping from here. What\u2019s important is the safety of princess Iroha. The protection of the princess will be firstly done by the maids. That\u2019s why, there\u2019s no need to think about unnecessary teamwork. In the fights, you just go about your usual teamwork with your usual comrades to protect princess Iroha.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Understood.\u201d (Misura)</p><br/><p>Misura nods.</p><br/><p>How reassuring.</p><br/><p>If he were to seriously do the protecting, I feel like the escape and bodyguarding can be done at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, let\u2019s go. I have already spoken to the princess and the others about the route. Once we go outside, don\u2019t trust anyone. Also\u2026\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lime-san glances at Sif and Yuno, and for only an instant, he stopped his words.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t hesitate. On the enemy side, there\u2019s people with higher level than yours and more experience, and most of them won\u2019t hesitate in killing anyone except the princess. It might even be that everyone there won\u2019t hesitate.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>With an incredibly indifferent voice that held no emotions which I have never seen before from him, Lime-san continues.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why, don\u2019t hesitate. No matter who it is, anyone that\u2019s directing their blade at you, don\u2019t think about it and just cut them down. There\u2019s millions of people who have died while they were thinking. You guys make sure you never enter those numbers.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Thank you very much, Lime-san.\u201d (Izumo)</p><br/><p>A kindness that couldn\u2019t be detected from simply his tone of voice could be felt.</p><br/><p>Words of gratitude honestly came out of my mouth.</p><br/><p>Now that I think about it, have I ever been able to feel true gratitude at warnings before I met with Sensei?</p><br/><p>\u201cI will hear your gratitude at tomorrow\u2019s breakfast. Definitely will. Now go!!\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>My eyes met with princess Iroha\u2019s.</p><br/><p>As I thought, a warm feeling wells up.</p><br/><p>I forcefully push them back and concentrate my fighting will \u2014in order to protect.</p><br/><p>\u201cIzumo-sama and his comrades! I am Akashi! I work as the bodyguard of Iroha-sama. It may be for a short time but, I am looking forward to working with you. Well then, first of all, let\u2019s escape the hotel! Follow me!\u201d (Akashi)</p><br/><p>\u201cSame here. A bodyguard of Iroha-sama, name\u2019s Yuduki. I will not think of you people as students, but close aides of the princess. All excuses like \u2018this is my first time\u2019 are a no. Do your best, okay?\u201d (Yuduki)</p><br/><p>\u201cMy name is Shougetsu, Izumo-sama. In order to decide a date for the wedding, let\u2019s overcome this long night!\u201d (Shougetsu)</p><br/><p>I will do it.</p><br/><p>Even if I have to bring out everything that is held within this body of mine.</p><br/><p>If it is not enough, I will bring out everything out of my future self as well!</p><br/><p>I will bring the Princess to where Sensei is.</p><br/><p>We will all bring her there!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Just a heads up. On Saturdays my job gets incredibly busy and I am 100% unable to touch the computer so, on those days I wont be able to progress at all.</p><br/><p>This chapter had so many weird idioms &gt;-&lt; I hope for your comprehension.</p><br/><p>Anyways, enjoy!\ud83d\ude00</p><br/><p>\u2014-</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the Kuzunoha company-sama right? Do you have your merchant guild plate with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>[No, I lost it on the way. I will have one re-issued for me at a later town so just treat us as normal guests, no, lodge us as adventurers] (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Writing that, I take out my level 1 adventurer plate in the reception of the inn.</p><br/><p>I decided that from now on if they were to ask me my social status I would present myself with the name \u2018Kuzunoha Company\u2019 that I thought of, and show \u2018my\u2019 plate. Honestly, I feel that if we show Tomoe or Mio\u2019s plates it would only stir unnecessary trouble.</p><br/><p>HuHumph~ But isn\u2019t this nice? I am Raidou-san, the heir of the Kuzunoha Company-desu yo. *TN: Devil Summoner reference*</p><br/><p>Is this my long awaited debut? I have become a summoner! In a form that I do not desire\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2014There is no houseboy in sight, and no test tubes. It is truly a name only\u2014</p><br/><p>Even though I long for, I won\u2019t hope for it. HAHAHA, this sounds like a riddle.</p><br/><p>My two followers are monsters so it\u2019s fine if I call myself a summoner. In terms of race they would be Dragon King and Wicked maybe.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you lost it? What a misfortune. In this area we only have the branch office of the merchant guild after all. It must be quite inconvenient for you\u201d</p><br/><p>[I traveled in a dangerous place so it\u2019s good that it just came to that. I originally didn\u2019t plan to come to the borders after all] (Makoto)</p><br/><p>More like, I didn\u2019t have plans on coming to this world.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good that you are fine. For you to be able to arrive at this base without any prior arrangements is close to a miracle, honorable guest\u201d</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s because my companions are skilled. I wish to get two rooms. Are they available?] (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, of course. However, we only have the most expensive room available, is it okay with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tch, so that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to be. But the other inns don\u2019t have a sky view. Due to the season there are no proper rooms.</p><br/><p>It is a bit shameful for me to say it but an adventurer and a normal guest are different quality of customers so I would like some kind of distinction in their rooms.</p><br/><p>To think that the established lodgings had so much popularity.</p><br/><p>Ugh, I thought I would be able to get a room if I just said \u2018how much gold would one honorable guest be for?\u2019</p><br/><p>[How much will it be?] (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see. It\u2019s a lodging as an adventurer so the caring of your carriage and horse will be more expensive\u201d</p><br/><p>Ugh~, to have a merchant guild preference would have meant that the carriage would be counted as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe lodging fee will be treated as an adventurer so it will be slightly cheaper than when treated as a merchant\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It seems like he is having troubles saying something, this reception-kun. Junior, from what Gal-game* character did you come from? (TN: romance game for girls)</p><br/><p>His fidgeting appearance fits him too well.</p><br/><p>[What is it?]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about your cargo but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I nod and press him to continue.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith an adventurer treatment we will look after you carriage but we can\u2019t warrant the safety of your cargo. I am truly sorry but, if there is the case of a robbery, we will not be taking responsibility for it\u201d</p><br/><p>It was quite a difficult matter to say. Truly.</p><br/><p>Well, an adventurer normally doesn\u2019t leave in custody a carriage filled with luggage.</p><br/><p>And in the case of merchants, the carriage is normally filled with goods. The responsibility that the inn would have to take would be big.</p><br/><p>Moreover, this place.</p><br/><p>The public order in here is probably not that good. I have never heard about a refugee camp that has public order regulation.</p><br/><p>[I don\u2019t mind. In terms of my cargo, no matter what happens, I will not charge for responsibility] (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, three persons, care for the carriage and 1 night. That will be 6 gold\u201d</p><br/><p>So expensiiiive!!</p><br/><p>Oh?!</p><br/><p>Is the economic knowledge that the dwarfs taught me already a thing of the past?</p><br/><p>I thought that the price of the lodgings would be in silvers at most.</p><br/><p>In this world, the currency runs in silver and gold. And then there is the one called Moria-silver, a metal that has traces of maryoku, if processed it becomes demon-silver coin. Taking 5 demon coins it would be equivalent to the processed yellow-gold coins.</p><br/><p>I thought that Moria-silver was the pseudonym of mithril. It seems that in this world it\u2019s a different thing. If it were the same thing they would be able to make the adventurer plate into a demon-coin after all.</p><br/><p>By the way, there is an easy way to explain it in terms of current Japan.</p><br/><p>Copper coin = 10 yen. Just how it looks.</p><br/><p>Silver coin = 1000 yen.</p><br/><p>Gold coin = 10,000 yen.</p><br/><p>Is how it would go. Demon coins would be 1,000,000 yen. The yellow-gold coins is a piece of fine art and is super high class, like the Koban*. It\u2019s even said that you can make a castle with it. (TN: Koban is a former Japanese oval gold coin)</p><br/><p>In the Edo-era there was something that was even more valuable than Koban and the exchange rates in those times was pretty similar. For example 5 ryo of medium size and 10 ryo of large size. (TN: Not sure about this part. \u306b\u3082\u306e\u306e\u304c\u3042\u3063\u305f\u306e\u3068\u3058\u3060\u308d\u3046\u3002\u306e\u3068\u304b\u306e\u307f\u305f\u3044\u306b\u3002)</p><br/><p>A normal office worker\u2019s salary would be 2-30 silver coins. I noticed that it felt pretty deflated.</p><br/><p>Above all, it should be fine to just use gold normally. Because you have to change the silver into gold in order to buy and that is troublesome. I pray it\u2019s just this place that is like this. Just because 1 gold coin is the same as 1 ryo, please spare me that the buying system will be just as troublesome.</p><br/><p>Wa~ for one person to stay one night is 20,000 yen?</p><br/><p>A frontier I want to enter but can\u2019t, and even when I enter I learn harsh reality. Isn\u2019t that way too much?</p><br/><p>Moreover, there is no insurance for your carriage!</p><br/><p>What should we do? Is a merchant supposed to come here with a broad-mind?* (Tn: prepared to \u201cshare\u201d your goods)</p><br/><p>But the gold I have is the money that the dwarfs gave me, they did tell me that it was unnecessary for them so it\u2019s okay for us to use it anyway we want but\u2026</p><br/><p>If we sell our goods, will we be able to get enough money?</p><br/><p>What a commoner I am.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen for now, 10 days please\u201d</p><br/><p>?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t want to show my agitation so I just slowly turn to the side.</p><br/><p>There I could see Tomoe-san with a wallet (that\u2019s how it looks to me) and taking a gold coin and leaving it in the counter.</p><br/><p>Taking 2 gold coins.</p><br/><p>3 gold coins.</p><br/><p>I could hear the BGM of hi~fu~mi. (TN: a Japanese song for shrine offerings. Maybe)</p><br/><p>Where is your sense of money? I see~ there is no way you have.</p><br/><p>But you, your whole fortune is 100 coins you know?</p><br/><p>Are you just going to throw away 60 of them?</p><br/><p>10 days of stay would be 600,000 yen, awawa. Since when did I become such a celebrity?</p><br/><p>600,000 to stay in this log-house.</p><br/><p>\u201cCertainly, then, let me guide you to your room\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh~ and also\u201d</p><br/><p>Tomoe stops the shota* from the counter with a prideful expression. This idiot, what is she going to say now? (TL: a cute or handsome young boy)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u2026 hiii!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWaka is a kind one but I am a bit short fused you see, I get reproved a lot\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Tomoe takes out from her bosom the plate that has a mad level carved in it, as if it was nothing and continues. This looks like a threat\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI have been looking at the inn for a while but, \u2018no vacancy\u2019 huh. For us to be able to stay here is truly a blessing. Is the price reasonable?\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is, of course. It is such a place and I consider that it\u2019s the best place around here\u201d</p><br/><p>The boy that responds while trembling. Eh, this guy. He is a bit suspicious.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a relief. Because the last inn\u2019s best room was 1 gold for 3 persons a night so, I was a bit doubtful. I was just about to blow away the whole inn if there was any sort of deceit you know? Fufufufu\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Tomoe is gently laughing. Only her mouth.</p><br/><p>I thought she didn\u2019t look at her surroundings, this girl, she unexpectedly is.</p><br/><p>When I check it out, Mio was also giggling. To laugh only with your mouth has a certain violent feel to it. Though the moment they open their mouths I can only see them as disappointing girls.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will confirm it one last time-ja, in this place its 6 gold a night right?\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 that is, um\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>So they were really overcharging us huh. With a pretty face that looks like he wouldn\u2019t be able to kill a bug, to pull off such a villainous act.</p><br/><p>No, it\u2019s normal huh. He is just a short male. Hmm, I can\u2019t get used to this.</p><br/><p>To not judge a single bit by appearance, I feel it\u2019s a bit hard for me right now.</p><br/><p>When I see a beautiful girl my face still becomes loose. I am a man after all, I can\u2019t help it you know? I\u2019m a fresh high-schooler.</p><br/><p>Ah, now that I think about it, does this world have schools?</p><br/><p>\u201cI-It was 2 gold! I made a mistake, I am sorry!\u201d</p><br/><p>He made a buckling apology. But you know, even with that, a night is still is still over 60,000 yen. (TN: yeah, that number is weird. \u304b\u3063\u3066\u306e\u3092\u3057\u305f\u3002\u3060\u3051\u3069\u3055\u3001\u305d\u308c\u3067\u3082\u304b\u3002)</p><br/><p>Hey. Just because I am wearing such a stylish mask don\u2019t go making the price 3 times higher okay?!</p><br/><p>If this place were like a palace I would accept it though.</p><br/><p>Just because it\u2019s important to live under a roof don\u2019t go pulling me this.</p><br/><p>\u201cHohou~ quite the \u2018mistake\u2019 you did there huh. Tto\u201d</p><br/><p>Bakya!</p><br/><p>Tomoe slipped (faked) and her leg destroyed the floor.</p><br/><p>The boy who saw the hole stood still, his face pale.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, sorry. It looks like the floor was a bit old\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Of course that wasn\u2019t the case. With the color of the boy\u2019s face, one was able to infer it.</p><br/><p>\u201cTomoe-san, please be careful okay? Ah that\u2019s right, boy-san. The remaining money we will be taking it at a later time so, please do take care of it okay?\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Mio is also merciless. Now he has to hold onto the money for 10 days and take responsibility in safekeeping it, without a choice.</p><br/><p>If there is less, or there are rumors that it has been stolen\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way?! I-I will be returning right now so\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo no, it\u2019s a pain so. Master doesn\u2019t mind such an amount of money. I am looking forward to the meal. One that is fitting of the price. Meal wise\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Mio sweetly smiles and the boy quickens his pace. If there is no will to receive it, then they will not forgive any objections. They told him to go ahead.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>I have been thinking about it but\u2026</p><br/><p>These fellows that can proceed a conversation so smoothly, why is it that they cause a commotion in the guild?</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t understand. I can only feel deep evil intentions in their actions.</p><br/><p>The boy stands still after showing us our room.</p><br/><p>His face turns to me as if asking for salvation.</p><br/><p>Are you a Chihuahua?!</p><br/><p>I will tell you now, I am not a dog but a cat man!</p><br/><p>That\u2019s not it.</p><br/><p>Even if I am into dogs, I wouldn\u2019t think about saving an evil chihuahua that tried to deceive me.</p><br/><p>Ha~</p><br/><p>Even though I decided not to sigh anymore\u2026 I ignore the face of the boy and enter the room that was shown to me.</p><br/><p>\u2014-</p><br/><p>\u201cYareyare, I didn\u2019t know what would happen but we were able to clear it up\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat boy will probably be stiff from now on. He tried to gain large amounts of money and now he has to protect that money, ufufu\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cTomoe and Mio, your personalities are pretty bad. The boy has fault in it as well so I can\u2019t say much though\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>We are already inside the room so it should be fine to speak.</p><br/><p>Of course, I am not expecting that the place is soundproof though. If I don\u2019t talk loudly the people outside shouldn\u2019t be able to hear me.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like the price is a lot higher than what we heard it would be\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a remote region after all. It seemed like the service has some issues so it can\u2019t be helped\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, the prices of products was an abnormality in itself. The water had a higher price than a knife. And the monsters\u2019 fangs and claws were higher than the water\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cAre they tasty?\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, isn\u2019t it because they are materials? Mio, let\u2019s stop thinking of everything as food okay?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>She is an insatiable spider after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe things that can only be obtained here are being sold at a really high price. After that we have the things that are hard to obtain. Then we have the common armors and protection. How warped huh\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Tomoe is unexpectedly looking at things objectively.</p><br/><p>Its true that in this place the normal weapons are really cheap. One of the reasons is because, probably, the usability is low. A normal weapon will quickly be unusable and has to be changed constantly.</p><br/><p>Special products and most likely their materials are being sold at truly high prices.</p><br/><p>But it slightly preoccupies me.</p><br/><p>Even if we call it normal equipment, there is the labor work as well and it takes materials. With that, it\u2019s still cheap.</p><br/><p>And the pleasantries and commodities are fairly expensive.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t like this, so even in other worlds there is political influence.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way, there seems to be a merchant guild. Is it okay for us to sell at our own convenience?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cFumu, there is certainly a branch section here as well\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s not okay wouldn\u2019t they have come stop us?\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>With how things are, that is no good. It seems Mio is not that fitted to do business.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen that would make the \u2018I lost it\u2019 words of waka have issues. A company that doesn\u2019t even know the common sense of the merchant guild, that would make the words of the heir lose credibility\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>The one that was supposed to be stupid, Tomoe, unexpectedly said something I wanted to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s how it is. Mio, I am sorry but, could you go to that branch office and say some half-hearted thing like wanting to enter the guild so you can get information about their rules and regulations?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Now, like, right now waka-sama?\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Because by tomorrow the information about you two will surely be spread all over the town. Today is the best time. Now, go go\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cGeez, I get it. I will go do it\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Mio reluctantly left the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow nice-desu na. You are truly learning how to use your followers. That\u2019s how my rouko* should be\u201d (Tomoe) (TN: Elder nobleman)</p><br/><p>\u201cI am not a rouko! If you guys didn\u2019t stand out we wouldn\u2019t need to be doing things so stealthily you know?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, to investigate things after reaching your room, isn\u2019t that the epitome of Mito Koumon?\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Tomoe-san tilts her head. Like I have been telling you, please don\u2019t go relating things to Koumon-sama.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo no, it is not decided that there is an evil magistrate at this place anyways\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThere should be one\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you so sure?!\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Is the world so ridden with evil?!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe prices of the products are way too abnormal after all. No matter how I think about it, there must be something\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>She is seriously sharp. Could it be that when she enters \u2018period drama\u2019 mode her stupid neurons go away?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are quite something Tomoe\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have noticed it as well waka. There is someone here gaining dirty money. In an unjust way~\u266a\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t go \u2018In an unjust way~\u266a\u2019 on me. All happy.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Mio can catch onto something we would be able to move more easily but\u2026\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s impossible. She is unaware of her surroundings and she is pretty on guard. Maybe she would even come back while being tailed\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>And why are you so happy about that?</p><br/><p>I give up. It\u2019s true that most of our cargo is pleasantries. So that makes it certain that it will be targeted.</p><br/><p>Ah~ no good, it\u2019s only been 15 minutes and I already feel like we are going the path of Mito Koumon.</p><br/><p>\u201cI honestly think that Tomoe is fit to do the part of evil magistrate or Echigoya\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>The \u2018Kukuku\u2019 way of laughing she has, it suits her a lot.</p><br/><p>More like, there are no people that correspond to the Mito Koumon family-da yo.</p><br/><p>Aside from the aforementioned part.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter how you see it I am Kaku-san!\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cKaku-san is originally bare-handed!\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThen a Kaku-san that uses swords!\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnything goes?!\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Then it would be like the one who says \u2018flying monkey named Gin-san\u2019 wins! (TN: I didn\u2019t understand this idiom. Something about a flying monkey\u2026\u305d\u3057\u305f\u3089\u304a\u3001\u3073\u306a\u304a\u3055\u3093\u3068\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3082\u3093\u3061\u306b\u306a\u308b\u3060\u308d\u3046\u304c\uff01)</p><br/><p>U~ I imagined it. Disgusting.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways, I will be going with Kaku-san so, I am counting on you!!\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>She is forcefully making me accept it!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 geez, yeah yeah Kaku-san*\u201d (Makoto) (TN: he uses the character = Nuclear weapon, instead of)</p><br/><p>For you to be Kaku-san is plenty, you bomb.</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel like the writing for yours was different!\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>What kind of six sense do you have?!</p><br/><p>\u201cI have my suspicions that you had some evil intentions when you caused a commotion in the guild\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t \u2018Eh\u2019 me! Why is it that it sounds like a confession?!</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t handle you!</p><br/><p>So she really went period drama style and caused problems?</p><br/><p>\u201cSo its \u2018Eh\u2019 huh? Tomoe~\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cwa wa wa wa wa\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cWell for now let\u2019s leave that aside. There is something I want you to do. Okay?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cHoho~ and that is?\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd then\u2026 and that\u2019s how\u2026 and then we do this\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cI see, that is, quite nice. It sounds interesting\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>I felt like she would go along with it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, I\u2019m counting on you\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cAs you will. I will prepare it as soon as possible-desu zo\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>*knock*knock</p><br/><p>N, who could it be?</p><br/><p>I exchange looks with Tomoe.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cMio-desu wa, is it okay if I open the door?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t mind-zo\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>The return of Mio huh.</p><br/><p>I stretch out a searching [Sakai] on the surroundings.</p><br/><p>There are 6 people surrounding the inn huh. They move their bodies well. They can\u2019t be amateurs.</p><br/><p>To think she would really bring tailers.</p><br/><p>\u201cAra, waka. What is it? To suddenly stare at me\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>What could it be~?</p><br/><p>Tomoe seems to have noticed that a number of people have been following.</p><br/><p>For now they haven\u2019t entered.</p><br/><p>So it means that our cargo is still fine.</p><br/><p>We have threatened the reception well so the information wont leak that fast.</p><br/><p>But with how he is, I feel that he would be easily enticed by gold.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s still a high class inn though. I am counting on you, seriously.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cI have spoken with the merchant guild\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, and?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems that we can\u2019t open a business without the guild proof-desu wa. If we want a re-issue of it we should go to Yadoriki town or a place called Tsige\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe distance?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter passing three other towns it would take 1 month, or so I was told\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Towns. We have to pass 3 camps just like this one before finally reaching our destination?</p><br/><p>That\u2019s long. And that we won\u2019t be able to get money before that, is harsh. Even if these two do jobs, they are still E rank after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there any way to sell our things?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems that if we utilize the commerce area, there won\u2019t be any problems\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cCommerce area?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Was there such a place?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a place that belongs to the merchant guild and it\u2019s a place where we can do middle wholesales. I wonder what middle wholesale means\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>If you don\u2019t know please ask the guild while you were there, not me.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt means that you can sell to other merchants as well. But, that is\u2026\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I will be able to use them as reference to know the prices. It\u2019s not fun to sell in a wicked place though.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell it is true that we are carrying things that will go bad fast so. Let\u2019s go to that commerce area tomorrow and sell everything\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>It should make a decent amount of profit.</p><br/><p>A day will finally be over.</p><br/><p>After that it will be eating and sleeping only.</p><br/><p>As expected, there will be a lot of things to be done when you arrive to a town for the first time.</p><br/><p>For today let\u2019s pass on going back to Asora and just quickly sleep.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. To think you won\u2019t mind about the tailers\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cTailer\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have been followed\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe great me was?!\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Well Mio is originally the type who wouldn\u2019t evade things. She is the type who would receive it all and absorb it.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s to the point that I would even want to call her Hart-sama*. (TN: don\u2019t know what the reference is)</p><br/><p>\u201cI will finish them off right now!\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Mio walks determinedly to the window.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, its fine. I let them swim around, Mio\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut!\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cIts fine\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cMu~\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt will soon be time for the meal. Let\u2019s just enjoy it\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>It seems that the word meal has attracted the attention of Mio.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Tomoe\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it, waka?\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cFor now you will be on standby in the carriage. And for one night I will be counting on you for the cargo. It looks like there is suspicious company. I can see a lot of movements trying to look for our carriage\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cW-What did you say?!\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause, aren\u2019t you the Kaku-san? This type of things, they are the duty of Kaku-san you know~\u266a?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cM-My meal?\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo-ne\u266a\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cA-Are you an Oni, waka?!\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t put a finger in the cargo okay? It\u2019s a given if you are part of a company after all\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cA-A demon, a demon is here!\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cJust how tired do you think I am because of you? Yes, this is an order!\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I have to show who has the authority here.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t care if you call me an Oni or a Demon. Fuhahahahaha.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014-</p><br/><p>Translator: Pee on her to show dominance! \u2026 Okay no. *sits in a corner</p><br/>\n</div>"}

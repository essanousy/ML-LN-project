I captured 1 that is right there!\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Is what she responded nonchalantly.</p><br/><p>I had told Tomoe to \u2018please spare me from slaughtering everyone and if anyone tries to escape capture them\u2019</p><br/><p>That\u2019s what I said!</p><br/><p>But then Tomoe said, \u2018Well you see, the important part about not killing everyone, I didn\u2019t understand the point completely-desu YO!\u2019</p><br/><p>She was blabbering something about the first one dying by accident and the other one dying was out of her expectations, but that is just out of question!</p><br/><p>Wiping with the sword or that a kick send him dancing in the air and was left out of commission. It was probably a shock or something like that.</p><br/><p>Like, \u2018I was aiming for the weapon but I ended up cutting his whole body\u2019 that kind of thing.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not that excessive but, going \u2018tee-hee\u2019 is wrong with that kind of explanation!</p><br/><p>What kind of slaughtering crime scene is that?!</p><br/><p>I tried asking Mio if she could do something about it with her hunger, I mean, if she could handle the cleaning up and she said \u2018I can\u2019.</p><br/><p>So I had her go right away to the crime scene.</p><br/><p>Next, before explaining the situation to the villager that was fiercely gazing at Tomoe, I take the captive that was rendered powerless to the bed.</p><br/><p>He had a slender body. I don\u2019t understand the standards of this world anymore so if anyone told me this is a macho body I would just lift my hands and give up.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey Tomoe, could it be that you kidnapped a woman?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cFukukuku!\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>What? Why are you laughing Tomoe-san?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought you would say waka!\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>So what are you trying to tell me?!</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd this is what you want to say right?! \u2018Tomoe, you are rea~lly an evil magistrate\u2019\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>What is she saying with so much pride? Well, she did say what I wanted to say. To go through the trouble of specifically choosing a woman, that is what an evil magistrate would do.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat one is a man-desu!\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Her figure when she said that felt like it came with a sound effect of \u2018*BLING!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>No.</p><br/><p>Even.</p><br/><p>If that is the case.</p><br/><p>What of it?!</p><br/><p>More like, before taking the weapon away you should have at least done a body check right?</p><br/><p>Well she must have done it. She is so sure it\u2019s a man after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa~ I don\u2019t really care about that but. This guy doesn\u2019t hold any weapons right? Did you perform a body check?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Even though I say bed, it\u2019s not like we are putting on a blanket over him. We can see his whole body but\u2026</p><br/><p>Is this really a man?</p><br/><p>It strange~ly looks womanly though. Especially in the waist part.</p><br/><p>Um. Hey hey.</p><br/><p>Tomoe~ please pay more attention.</p><br/><p>In the waist holder I can see something that looks like an edged tool.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo she didn\u2019t do it huh. Geez. If you are to let him sleep in the room at least make sure to take care of all of the dangerous objects. How careless\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I take out the knife from the holder and confiscate it. Is it for throwing purposes? It didn\u2019t seem to be made for the purpose of swinging it. Well it didn\u2019t give me the impression that it was a weapon you would swing after getting your opponent lower their guard at the very least.</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I didn\u2019t think you would bring a civilian here so if it\u2019s just waka and me I thought it would be interesting and\u2026 well\u2026\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Tomoe goes \u2018a wa wa\u2019 and has a wry smile. You think of scary attractions.</p><br/><p>\u201cN\u2026 Ha~\u201d</p><br/><p>Otto. Turning in your sleep huh. This person is a deep sleeper.</p><br/><p>*Buchi</p><br/><p>\u201cWa?\u201d</p><br/><p>I heard the sound of cloth ripping off.</p><br/><p>The chest area of captive-san began to expand.</p><br/><p>Silence.</p><br/><p>An excessive silence.</p><br/><p>There were no words.</p><br/><p>Tomoe-san looked dumbfounded at the captive and me, she began to shrink slowly and did a seiza.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s one of those types that wrap their chest with bands. And this person was doing exactly that. That\u2019s not smooth.</p><br/><p>It seems she tightened it pretty well and made it so it didn\u2019t stand out.</p><br/><p>If that wasn\u2019t the case it wouldn\u2019t go \u2018*buchi\u2019 after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cT-This must be some kind of conspiracy-desu zo! That\u2019s right, there is no way such an \u2018all sides closed\u2019 can exist!\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Her insistence is pitiful.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou~ at least care for your master a little bit more. You do know which type is easier to interrogate right? Right?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, like I said, just ignore the chest. This time it should have definitely been a man though\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Ignore the chest? What is that? I don\u2019t understand what you are trying to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways, I am telling you to peel them off if you are to bring them here. If you take off their clothes then you will be able to dispose of their weapons and other tools at the same time\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cWell you see, won\u2019t you treat me as a pervert if I take off her clothes? So the anxiety\u2026\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cPriorities first! This isn\u2019t a drama so ethics can go eat shit! Between an idiot and a pervert I think a pervert would have a better chance to be salvaged!\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s my own opinion though.</p><br/><p>\u201cUmu\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t agree!</p><br/><p>\u201cMore like, Tomoe\u2026\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cU, um\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>N?</p><br/><p>What is it? This low voice\u2019s whereabouts that feel like it would disappear. This is a voice that Mio and Tomoe would definitely not have. In the room, there was someone else?</p><br/><p>OH!</p><br/><p>Villager A! Beautiful girl A.</p><br/><p>Now that I look carefully, there is certainly a girl with an uneasy face.</p><br/><p>Words she shouldn\u2019t be able to understand and strangers she barely knows.</p><br/><p>Fumu, this certainly would create uneasiness. Especially because I am supposed to be unable to speak or so that\u2019s how I had explained to her already. There is no helping that she thinks of me as suspicious.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I forgive you. Next time be more careful\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cOh~ I thank you, unknown girl!\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>In that part you should be thanking me first right?! You go thank the other party right away?!</p><br/><p>And moreover, in that part she properly used the common language.</p><br/><p>Just how confident are you?</p><br/><p>I really want that fast way of thinking to be used for my sake! I will cry you know?</p><br/><p>\u201cOnii-san, I heard that you couldn\u2019t speak though?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can speak\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I try to speak friendlily in common language. I felt like maybe it would work.</p><br/><p>\u201c??\u201d</p><br/><p>When she tilted her head I understood the answer. I look at Tomoe. She nods and looks at the girl. Really, how mindful you are.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight now waka is able to \u2018speak\u2019 in common language, is what he tried to say. You didn\u2019t understand right?\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?! I heard him say \u2018Eat is mu ni mu ni~\u2019?!\u201d</p><br/><p>N-No way, this might be too big of a shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, that is a part of the curse you see. From the start waka was able to utilize various languages and he is using one of those to communicate with us\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cE-Eh? It\u2019s not an illness?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cN, that\u2019s right. It was actually a curse-na no ya. But its not like he will infect anyone and there will be people who will discriminate him. We don\u2019t want discrimination after all\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Oh~ in a playful manner she was able to mix the illness and curse at the same time.</p><br/><p>The girl was also smoothly convinced. Un un, from now on use that ability to speak for my benefit.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat he is able to use many languages and have the common language sealed. That is definitely the work of the demon race! How cruel!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wait, why the demon race?</p><br/><p>Are curses monopolized by the demon race? If that\u2019s so then I will have to change the excuse.</p><br/><p>For a simple excuse to make other people hate a certain race is no good.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, such a troublesome race-ja no~. And then, girl, why did you come with waka here?\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>[Hey wait] (Makoto)</p><br/><p>This time I use writing before I tap the shoulder of Tomoe.</p><br/><p>Why~ is it that you are able to accept so normally that conversation just now? There is something you haven\u2019t told me right?!</p><br/><p>\u201cOh~ waka, what is it?\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Ah, I am sure now. There IS something.</p><br/><p>[Why is it certain that my curse was done by a demon race?] (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I ask the girl. It\u2019s truly good that she is able to read.</p><br/><p>Of course, I noticed that this was plain luck. That\u2019s because the literacy rate in this world is not that high.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause the common language is a blessing given by the goddess a little before you are born and is something that everyone in the world can speak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, but demons and demi-humans are unable to. Those people are not accepted by the goddess so they have to study to be able to speak it\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut there are people that have this thing called \u2018tamer\u2019 and they are able to speak with the monsters that can\u2019t speak the common language and there are some that can enslave them\u201d</p><br/><p>She talks about \u2018tamer\u2019 like she hates the word of it.</p><br/><p>The word \u2018everyone\u2019 that the girl says, I could understand that she only meant hyuman and it makes me a bit sad. But more than that.</p><br/><p>Categorization, monster huh. I am one of those.</p><br/><p>And, blessing huh. From what I heard, if you visit the shrine of the goddess-sama every year you are able to slowly understand words, and then you will be able to speak.</p><br/><p>There are some individual differences but they will normally be able to understand words at 3 years old. The girl tells me that she was able to at 4 years old.</p><br/><p>With that, I won\u2019t be able to talk. More like, the demons and demi-humans that studied from cero and learned it, honestly, I respect them.</p><br/><p>Because, weren\u2019t they successful? They repeat \u2018A u e\u2019 and then it became words.</p><br/><p>This is what everyone uses, the common language! \u2018Now, everyone that is not hyuman! Decode this groaning and begin studying!\u2019 is what you are telling me?</p><br/><p>Hm~. Hmph~.</p><br/><p>I see, so that\u2019s how it works.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Thaaa~t!!!!</p><br/><p>Friiiking Buugggg!!!</p><br/><p>So your wish is complete resistance huh!</p><br/><p>That\u2019s fine with me. If it\u2019s like this then let\u2019s go all out!</p><br/><p>Looking for the traces of my parents takes precedence though. However!</p><br/><p>After that I will DEFINITELY hit that goddess in the face at least once. Even if she is a woman I won\u2019t hold back! This is! The first time in my life! That I vow to violence against a woman!</p><br/><p>Make sure to look forward to our reunion you goddess piece of\u2026 (The other parts are too hard for the ears and they will be too long so we have taken them out. Do pardon us \u2013 by Tsukuyomi)</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. It may be a curse by the demons. Thank you for worrying. Please continue\u201d* (TN: not sure if Makoto \u2018said\u2019 it. Its not encased in [] in the original)</p><br/><p>And then.</p><br/><p>The girl began explaining the events to Tomoe.</p><br/><p>Anyways, that so called blessing.</p><br/><p>I am truly questioning that she is giving them directly, isn\u2019t she just making those nymphs do it for her?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The ends of my hands and legs can\u2019t reach the edges of the bed at all.</p><br/><p>In the past I took this posture a lot when I fell in deep thinking. And I also fell asleep in the middle of it a lot. Well, I am digressing though.</p><br/><p>My body buries deeply into the mat and on the contrary it actually made me restless.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s my first time having such luxurious thoughts.</p><br/><p>Rinon is not here. \u2018I will return to my house for a second\u2019 is what she said and left just like that.</p><br/><p>It must be a lie. To a house where her sister is not in, for her to go back there, I can\u2019t believe it.</p><br/><p>I am now lying down here while spreading a movement [Sakai] to follow her. The maryoku can\u2019t be felt and they are unable to detect my presence.</p><br/><p>The current Rinon has met with people a few meters away from the inn, at this distance I can hear their conversation perfectly if I just concentrate.</p><br/><p>The power that I received from Tsukuyomi-sama is truly useful. That I don\u2019t understand the theory sometimes hurts me though. </p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, did you get their background?\u201d</p><br/><p>Rinon shakes her head horizontally.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, the only thing I could get was that he is the heir of some company\u201d (Rinon)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is that? There is no difference from the information that the merchant guild has\u201d</p><br/><p>What did these guys expect? You really think I would tell everything to a kid that I have just met? Are these guys idiots?</p><br/><p>\u201cB-But. Because the carriage got attacked I haven\u2019t had many chances to talk with him\u201d (Rinon)</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that you mention it, the one that got captured had returned. We are washing her to check for magic and trickeries but nothing is coming out. What does this mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the time I woke up in the morning the two girls he had with him were already gone. And then I went with onii-chan to the commerce area\u201d (Rinon)</p><br/><p>\u201cCompanions huh. They were people that had bizarre levels. I don\u2019t know if they had an order of silence but it makes my eyebrows sweat. And?\u201d </p><br/><p>\u2026 I see, so they do silence people huh. And eyebrows sweat. Certainly\u2026</p><br/><p>For now I am happy that not much of the information has been leaked out.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe onee-chan that was sleeping on the bed, by the time we returned she was not there anymore\u201d (Rinon)</p><br/><p>\u201cHa~\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd then I told him that I would return to my house for a bit\u201d (Rinon)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a blockhead that youngling is. Without any restrains and with no lookouts\u201d</p><br/><p>Shut up. I feel a bit happy that you are believing all this but it somehow pisses me off.</p><br/><p>But well, looking at the appearance of Rinon and the attitude of the man, maybe he is really the \u2018can\u2019t be saved at all\u2019 type?</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, about the cargo, did you hear anything about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is\u2026 I don\u2019t understand it well\u201d (Rinon)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh~ its okay, just talk\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom here you travel 2 to 3 days and you will be enveloped by a deep mist where there is a settlement of mamono. He said he got it from them\u201d (Rinon)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m serious! That is what onii-chan said! That he didn\u2019t care about the price!\u201d (Rinon)</p><br/><p>Rinon must have felt some danger in the silence of the man, she desperately tried to explain it to him. Those two are not in a friendly relationship. That much I can tell.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat he didn\u2019t care about the price?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe said that they were dreamlike stuff so it was fine if they can be sold. The old men in the commerce area said that they would buy it for 500 gold coins\u201d (Rinon)</p><br/><p>\u201c500?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The voice of the man turns inside out. He is totally a person of low level.</p><br/><p>\u201cY-Yeah\u201d (Rinon)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe lowest of the lowest price was that. These may be incredible people. But, 500 gold huh\u201d</p><br/><p>A vulgar expression begins to surface from the man. I could tell that Rinon was disgusted.</p><br/><p>At any rate, the lowest of the lowest huh. And it\u2019s that amount of gold. How frightening. Is there another way they can use it aside from selling them at a high price for being new products?</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, hey~! Let me meet onee-chan! If I let you hear about a lot of things you would let me meet her right?!\u201d (Rinon)</p><br/><p>\u201cOi oi, those are words that you should say after properly doing your job right? With just this you will never be able to meet your sister\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026 Thrash.</p><br/><p>Capturing a small kid and making her do stupid jobs.</p><br/><p>My killing intent rises.</p><br/><p>I am seriously thinking if I could shoot him with magic from this point.</p><br/><p>I can do it.</p><br/><p>Lets do it.</p><br/><p>I begin the aria. And then rethink it.</p><br/><p>Tch, if I do it now Rinon will see someone dying in front of her. To suddenly see someone dying in front of you, it might become a trauma.</p><br/><p>Damn it, you slightly got away with your life.</p><br/><p>Rinon sticks to the guy and asks over and over. I breathe in deeply in order to suppress the killing intent that was slowly rising again.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you insist so much you leave me with no choice. Do one last job. Then I will return you your onee-chan. I will also forget about your debt\u201d</p><br/><p>Debt huh. It must be dirt cheap loose change for him.</p><br/><p>\u201c!! You are able to do something like that?!\u201d (Rinon)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah~, its easy. You accept?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man who suggested that was a limitless low \u2013life.</p><br/><p>Of course Rinon can\u2019t refuse.</p><br/><p>But\u2026</p><br/><p>I dissolve my [Sakai]</p><br/><p>I already know the result. I didn\u2019t want to hear the words directly after all.</p><br/><p>If what he said is true then Rinon\u2019s onee-san is probably still alive.</p><br/><p>If it turns out to be a lie I would turn it into a \u2018my first torture\u2019 and \u2018my first murder\u2019 combo.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not like I want to support Tomoe but I think I might act a bit violently, so I close my eyes in order to rest.</p><br/><p>This will be after my two followers return. There is nothing else to do right now.</p><br/><p>And when I think about Rinon, it must be more beneficial for her if she finds me sleeping.</p><br/><p>Soon it will be 45 minutes.</p><br/><p>I breathe in deeply and fall asleep.</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>Noisy.</p><br/><p>Ah, I see. I was sleeping, right.</p><br/><p>Is Rinon okay?</p><br/><p>Honestly, I was thinking of what to do with her from now on.</p><br/><p>If my followers bring me the information by the time I woke up.</p><br/><p>And Rinon is \u2018still alive\u2019, I plan on going a bit wild.</p><br/><p>If \u2018She is not\u2019 then I am going extremely wild.</p><br/><p>\u201cN, morning\u201d</p><br/><p>I look at my surroundings. There are four people.</p><br/><p>This is, fumu, for a \u2018first episode\u2019 it\u2019s a happy development.</p><br/><p>Tomoe, Mio, a woman that looks the same as the portrait and Rinon.</p><br/><p>\u201cWaka! You have awoken\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cWaka-sama, good morning\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>For them to be using good morning when its already evening, is it that? A retaliation against me for not letting them sleep? Or is it a business-like way of greeting?</p><br/><p>My two followers gave me greetings as expected. They have to do at least that. We are in front of people after all.</p><br/><p>Rinon is averting her gaze.</p><br/><p>And Rinon\u2019s sister is bowing her head deeply. She has a really nice posture. If you are going to drop your head so much then just do a dogeza* that is more comfortable than this.</p><br/><p>Dogeza</p><br/><p>The sister is safe for now. Her little sister had returned to attempt a crime, no, she was probably caught. That Mio didn\u2019t kill her was probably because of Tomoe.</p><br/><p>What a lucky little girl, no, both of the sisters huh. Its to the point that I want them to share a little bit of it with me.</p><br/><p>\u201cGirl, lift your head\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Tomoe told the sister that and she timidly lifted her head.</p><br/><p>[Forgive me for using writing. You can read right?] (Makoto)</p><br/><p>That her little sister can and the elder one can\u2019t, such a thing can\u2019t happen right?</p><br/><p>\u201cA, wa, yes! That you have rescued me at this instance, I truly thank you, very much!\u201d</p><br/><p>Being nervous to the extreme she thanked me while stuttering and fumbling. What? Is she a person that can\u2019t handle strangers?</p><br/><p>But a conversation is possible. Okay.</p><br/><p>Though, she got me. Even her voice of \u2018wa wa wa\u2019. Aside from the color of her hair, she was the exact copy of her*. </p><br/><p>[You are free to talk the way you want. You are not a follower or anything like that so] (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cAs you can see, she has returned with all her limbs waka\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cShe was being treated with some rough drugs but I have already cleaned them out\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>You two, your reports are practically asking me to give you praise. But they truly did do a good job.</p><br/><p>So Mio had a secret skill like poison counteraction huh. This will be useful.</p><br/><p>I once again look at the sister. Now that I think about it, her face had so much impact that I didn\u2019t remember her name. Uhm what was it again?</p><br/><p>I certainly heard it from Rinon but for some reason I can\u2019t find it.</p><br/><p>But\u2026</p><br/><p>While I am thinking about asking her again, I look at her from hair to the tip of her toes.</p><br/><p>The more I look the more I feel that this is not on the level of \u2018she resembles her\u2019.</p><br/><p>The worlds are different and yet there are two melons, how amazing.</p><br/><p>She is a bit taller than me. And her style that feels like it has already been completed. Her breast are on the big side.</p><br/><p>And her appearance that was practically a mirror image of \u2018that girl\u2019. Just, her eyes were a bit wild, more like, this is probably the eyes an adventurer has.</p><br/><p>They were eyes that were rough and filled with inquisitiveness.</p><br/><p>And her hair. She had the same red hair as her little sister. It was not a \u2018black hair dyed red\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cHasegawa right?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>It\u2019s the kohai* that I remembered thanks to Tomoe. </p><br/><p>The girl that confessed to someone like me, moreover, the kohai that I had awfully rejected and hurt.</p><br/><p>Hasegawa</p><br/><p>Hasegawa</p><br/><p>A cute and zealous kohai that gave her all in archery.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why even if I knew this girl was a completely different person, it disturbed my heart.</p><br/><p>It was an event that I was made to remember not too long ago so more the reason, or so I think.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>I accidentally called her by that name. Her lips moved slightly and from there the sister let out a voice in reaction.</p><br/><p>Tomoe let it slip by but the ears of Mio perked up and reacted to it. I feel that she will be questioning me pointlessly later.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a name from my previous world so they probably didn\u2019t take it as a person\u2019s name.</p><br/><p>[Its nothing. Anyways, I heard the situation from Rinon and was preoccupied. I am glad you are okay] (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cI was reaping what I sowed, but you have truly saved us. We have been able to properly \u2018manage\u2019 so I got ahead of myself\u201d</p><br/><p>Her way of rethinking about herself is the same as Hasegawa.</p><br/><p>Being able to more or less stand your ground in a harsh frontier, you can certainly get self-confident with that.</p><br/><p>But I don\u2019t know what to think about you bringing your little sister there.</p><br/><p>After all with one error the little sister ended up in beggar-like looks and tottering the town at night, her sister was being drugged and her life was in danger.</p><br/><p>[It seems that this is a pretty dangerous place. The outside is of course but the interior is as well. I have my followers with me so I am somehow able to live] (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I respond to her while mixing in a wry smile.</p><br/><p>In reality, the level of these two are practically the definition of bizarre.</p><br/><p>Hearing that the two of them were mentioned, their expressions changed, practically saying \u2018it was nothing\u2019. In a way like they were smirking.</p><br/><p>Really.</p><br/><p>But the moment I mentioned those two in the conversation, I noticed the change in the appearance of Hasegawa and her little sister.</p><br/><p>Her sister was moved, the little sister was cowering.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe strength of your followers was truly dreadful-desu. First, they appeared in the room that we were confined without a single sound, it was a quite epic and incredible thing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo no, it wasn\u2019t that much\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I use my darkness abilities something like that is nothing\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why I\u2019m saying your faces are too loose. There is a limit to how happy you can be.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! Then the darkness magic-desu! It helped me drive away the poison that was inside my body, and when we were returning, with her hands, she destroyed the door that was coated without even using an aria!\u201d</p><br/><p>Leaving aside the coating part, that she was able to clean the poison is pretty incredible. Next time I will ask her to teach me*. I think it was a bit too much to destroy the door though, but right now it\u2019s a plus for you Mio. </p><br/><p>However, even with that. I can\u2019t find an explanation for the state of Rinon when her sister has already returned.</p><br/><p>She was probably told by that man to steal the money, the moment she was about to give it she was caught by one of the two, maybe?</p><br/><p>I understand that she must feel guilty about it.</p><br/><p>But the sister that was her true objective has returned alive, so I think it should be fine to have a more cheerful face.</p><br/><p>Rinon that had a face that looked like she was worried, seems to be saying something. Without moving for a bit, she hung her head down all stiffly.</p><br/><p>\u201cMoreover, the lookouts and the able mercenaries were all handled by Tomoe-sama\u2019s splendid body ability, they all went *snap *snap\u201d</p><br/><p>Oh? I feel like she is telling me something in a roundabout way. Is she just exaggerating things? I warned Tomoe not too long ago after all.</p><br/><p>\u201c!!! Y-You are exaggerating Toa. I didn\u2019t do that much\u2026\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>There is one idiot here that looks like a kid who has been discovered doing bad things. She tried to restrain Toa but I stop her with my eyes. And then I clearly confirm the appearance of Mio that was sweating.</p><br/><p>The sister of Rinon called Toa, who was right now in a state of excitement, continued talking without the need for me to press her to continue.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018exaggerating\u2019-desu ka! Its my first time seeing such a thing!! Even the building that was made with special materials to resist demon attacks was destroyed without a trace by Tomoe-sama\u2019s fist and Mio-sama\u2019s darkness\u201d (Toa)</p><br/><p>The two of them were going \u2018a wa wa wa\u2019, they were at each side of Toa-san making an incredibly easy to understand reaction.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey even blew away the guild\u2019s strongest, Ace, and 50 other adventurer mercenaries that were teaming up!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026 Uh, hey?!</p><br/><p>What?! What is happening?! Don\u2019t tell me that while I was sleeping it already turned into an \u2018all is resolved, look forward to the next episode\u2019?!</p><br/><p>I am glad that I have a mask. I am sure that my face is showing a lot of expressions right now. Eh, are these tears?</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t know about this feeling.</p><br/><p>The words of Toa hit me in my heart in a way I didn\u2019t expect.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2013</p><br/><p>Translation note:</p><br/><p>Everything ended while he was sleeping. That was unexpected I suppose?</p><br/><p>Even though he decided to go wild. All that determination went down the drain. Haha xD</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It is a dangerous workplace in a different meaning from the adventurers.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre those all the reports for today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Adventurer Guild, Tsige branch.</p><br/><p>At the third floor where adventurers would rarely step into, at one of the rooms there, a man who had both of his legs crossed on top of the desk and both hands linked around his mouth spoke to ask for confirmation.</p><br/><p>The one facing him was an elderly man.</p><br/><p>He had a decent amount of presence, and must have had a good standing as well, and yet, the words directed at him had made the man straighten his back even more and place strength in his whole body.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Representative!\u201d</p><br/><p>The man sitting looked like he was still in the middle of his thirties, and if they are compared solely by appearance, it would be more plausible if their positions were reversed.</p><br/><p>But\u2026if the presence those two are releasing is taken into account, in other words, if someone else were to be in the room, they would be able to tell that the positions they are in are the correct ones.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s how much status the presence that the man was releasing from his whole body had.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo the completion rate of the wasteland related requests is still as low as always. Well, it probably can\u2019t be helped with how many of those requests are unreasonable though\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut the target number of requests that the headquarters had placed for this month has been safely fulfilled.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about the quota. Leaving aside the numerical values set here, you haven\u2019t forgotten the ideal request completion rate that the Adventurer Guild should be aiming for, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not! In the cases of the Adventurer Guilds established in common areas, the minimum completion rate of requests is 70%. The ideal to aim for is 85%!\u201d</p><br/><p>He responds to his superior with tension covering his body. There was no sign of the relaxed state that he showed when the strange adventurer had brought the ruby eye\u2019s eyes he had appraised.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026So, what\u2019s the current number for Tsige?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u202618%.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t even brag about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cS-Sorry for overstepping here but, thinking about the special circumstances of this town, I think there\u2019s parts that simply can\u2019t be helped. And in reality, the completion rate of the requests that are not related to the wasteland have surpassed 90%.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Hmph. And I am saying that it is a problem that this number is pushed down all the way to 18% when the wasteland requests are added to the equation. Isn\u2019t that proof that a great number of the requests brought here that denote the wasteland are not being properly done by the adventurers that are based here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026Representative, there\u2019s not many adventurers who can come and go to the wasteland stably. When an adventurer that can complete a decent amount of requests appears, they normally end up dying. Lately, the Lime Latte group that showed the best results seem to not be accepting much requests\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough! I don\u2019t want to hear excuses all day long. We really do have to establish a department that is specialized in the wasteland and change the way of dealing with it from right down the roots. But even if we want to make countermeasures, the amount of adventurers who can instruct in regards to the basics of the wasteland\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The Representative muttered the latter half with his expression still dark.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom within this month\u2019s deaths in the wasteland, how many of them didn\u2019t fulfill the level requirement?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we go by the corpses we managed to confirm the social position of, it is around 170.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven when the level requirement is placed for their own sake, they can\u2019t even follow that huh. The allure of a place where fortune lies might be great, but this is just\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The top of the Adventurer Guild in Tsige, Luther, made a long and heavy sigh.</p><br/><p>The pain of being unable to properly fulfill the duty of an Adventurer Guild was visible from the wrinkles formed between his eyebrows.</p><br/><p>After a while, he exhales silently as if changing gears.</p><br/><p>\u201cTruly saddening.\u201d (Luther) </p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThose numbers are not something we can\u2019t report to the higher-ups though. They are not problems we can resolve immediately by doing just one thing after all.\u201d (Luther)</p><br/><p>\u201cY-Yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, please tackle seriously the illegal entries to the wasteland by working together with branches in the area.\u201d (Luther)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can leave now.\u201d (Luther)</p><br/><p>\u201cU-Uhm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>His superior had announced the end of this tense time, but the man didn\u2019t nod, and instead, slightly furrowed his brows and speaks in a reserved manner.</p><br/><p>It is because his superior didn\u2019t question a part he thought strange of the things that were reported.</p><br/><p>An irregular report.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t the report about the usual numbers and the progress of things.</p><br/><p>And so, a part of the reason why he was in front of an elite of the Adventurer Guild was exactly because he wanted to have a discussion in regards to the details of this abnormality.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d (Luther)</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, there are a few people who have recently registered as adventurers\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it is about the matter of the level not increasing, I will take care of that. This should go without saying but, it is strictly prohibited to make this public.\u201d (Luther)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou will take care of it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease make the information of him and his surroundings as highly classified. I will most likely be dealing with it officially in the near future.\u201d (Luther)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What does that mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to stress over it. It is fine for you to just forget about this matter. That\u2019s all I mean. If I had to put it in simpler terms, it means that you have to take care not to let your tongue slip to the skilled adventurer group that you have been in good terms with for quite a good while and has been making strange movements lately. That\u2019s all I have to say.\u201d (Luther)</p><br/><p>\u201cHih! I-I will be taking my leave!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Finishing the report, the man, that had been acting slightly against the rules as a guild personnel, was shocked by the fact that his actions were known, and he immediately decided to leave.</p><br/><p>The only one remaining in the room was the representative that didn\u2019t change his posture from beginning to end.</p><br/><p>\u201cAn adventurer that doesn\u2019t show changes in his level huh. An error in the illusory system, or maybe some sort of curse? Let\u2019s observe him for a bit, and depending on the situation, I may have to report to the boss at Rotsgard. This only smells like trouble though.\u201d (Luther)</p><br/><p>A single person surfaces in the mind of the representative.</p><br/><p>The figure of a certain man that, if his memory serves right, hasn\u2019t changed in appearance since the time he was a child.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood grief. Lime forgetting his duty as an adventurer and biting at the Rembrandt Company; the wasteland having a mountain of requests; the adventurers that don\u2019t have strength, and yet, chase after the possibilities in the wasteland and end up dead; the requests far from being able to reach the 70% completion, can\u2019t even reach the 20% completion. Having these many problems actually makes it comical instead.\u201d (Luther)</p><br/><p>With a tone that one can tell the exhaustion in it, the representative looks at the ceiling.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder if a super adventurer, knight, or mage can move to Tsige and mediate the Rembrandt Company and Lime\u2019s dispute, and while at it, solve the problem of the Rembrandt Company consequently fixing the mood of Patrick-dono, and also take a bundle of requests and solve them all. Such an existence that holds enough power to nurture the path of the stagnating adventurers.\u201d (Luther)</p><br/><p>The representative mutters a monologue that was filled to the brim with wishful thinking.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no doubt that he is in a really high standing, but at the same time, it is also an exhausting job.</p><br/><p>It is certain that he is currently in a slightly dangerous state.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf only the rumoured Dragon Slayer were to come to the wasteland and kill the Superior Dragon there, or the super strong mercenary group that is shut in at Lorel Union coming here and fighting the mamonos and demi-humans in the wasteland. Hah\u2026if only the Goddess-sama were to send us a hero to deal with the wasteland as she did with the demon race\u2026\u201d (Luther)</p><br/><p>His thoughts had already reached the point where there was no logic to it and it was closer to delusions.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026No good. It is obvious that I will be collapsing first before any of these were to be fulfilled. If, on top of that, such a troublesome existence were to be thrown into Tsige, I would just explode. By dutifully working on the job in front of me, and polishing my abilities little by little everyday, the future will definitely turn for the better, and in time, all problems will be resolved; that was my belief -my support. But the work in Tsige doesn\u2019t seem like it has any end. I want to answer the expectations of my boss. I do honestly want to improve the guild in this town. But really, what should I even be doing\u2026\u201d (Luther)</p><br/><p>Even when knowing those ideals will not be reached, he had no choice but to do what he can.</p><br/><p>In the end, as if he had been on the verge of surrendering many times already, the representative reached the same conclusion.</p><br/><p>The caring of the adventurers, the treatment of the requests, and the dealing of the town; the preservation of the connections they have in order to make all those points move smoothly.</p><br/><p>The Adventurer Guild of Tsige was slowly being cornered.</p><br/><p>It is a situation where it wouldn\u2019t have been strange for the guild to have fallen a long time ago. The reason why it has managed to continue standing was obviously because of the reliable staff members and how capable the representative is. </p><br/><p>Will his pain be rewarded, or will he end up being crushed by the work?</p><br/><p>That answer would be appearing soon.</p><br/><p>He still didn\u2019t know that the exit of that long tunnel was close.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I bathe and change.</p><br/><p>Sit together with my family and then rest.</p><br/><p>In the late nights of autumn I read books, play games and browse the net.</p><br/><p>Sleep.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s all I did.</p><br/><p>There may be something in between the lines, but it\u2019s not that relevant.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s strange if I am not sleeping in my house!\u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. Without doubt.</p><br/><p>Even so, \u2018here\u2019 I am.</p><br/><p>In a square room that looked like the stars were printed on it. I went around inspecting the floor and the walls of the room.</p><br/><p>I was concerned at the fact that there is no door or way to exit.</p><br/><p>And since I have been here, I didn\u2019t feel the presence of anyone else at the entire time.</p><br/><p>Right now I was entrusting my back to a corner in the room and pondering.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are really calm, huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c?!\u201d</p><br/><p>A voice. But it was clearly a high volume yet nothing happened to the room. Looking around the room I saw that nothing in the room had changed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI used a high voice just once and then you went to search around the room and began to try and understand the present state of matters, and while being on the lookout you were trying to arrange your thoughts, huh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The voice continued. I only understood it was a voice. It seems it is better to understand it by asking directly.</p><br/><p>\u201cGod, if that was what I said, would you believe me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d</p><br/><p>This voice, does it have a screw loose?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is unfortunate. Then, I will now have you go to a REALLY good other world. By the way, it\u2019s a one way trip so you won\u2019t be able to return to your original world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOiOioioioioioioioioioi!!!\u201d (TL: heyheyheyheyhey)</p><br/><p>What kind of stupid thing is it saying so smoothly?</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout what you have to do, you should ask the one in charge of that place when you go. And with that, I am sorry but I would need a sign of your approval to this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLike hell I will!\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected, my voice went violent. It\u2019s a given, it\u2019s obvious, who would accept it after hearing that?!</p><br/><p>\u201cOya, you don\u2019t want to? It is a weird discussion but I heard you would be going.\u201d</p><br/><p>The voice seemed to have some troubled tone. There is a limit to jokes. I have in no way, heard about this beforehand!!!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a lie, I have never heard about such a talk! Okay? Moreover, what kind of idiot would just accept such a talk about another world?! That we are talking about it is just as weird!\u201d</p><br/><p>With all my ability I try to explain.</p><br/><p>\u201cFumu, it seems it was really not you. I did something bad, I apologize.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou see\u2026 I am happy that you have apologized but, are you going to bring me back?!\u201d</p><br/><p>My original tone of voice has still not returned. It may not be able to do it in a death match tone but I know that it\u2019s not a polite tone of voice. It\u2019s the fault of this incredibly bad situation. Its not my fault.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>The voice said so.</p><br/><p>I am glad. It\u2019s a \u2018voice\u2019 that can understand. In the normal template situations this is the part where it would say \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019, \u2018impossible\u2019 or \u2018oh well, try your best\u2019 and then throws you out.</p><br/><p>Or maybe the \u2018You are already dead~\u2019 guy tells you that and without hearing complains, it throws you to another world. Is what I thought would happen but\u2026</p><br/><p>I am saved~</p><br/><p>\u201cWell I am really sorry\u2026 But then, it must be your older sister or younger one\u201d</p><br/><p>I retract what I said. This guy said something that can\u2019t be passed as a joke. It said it in a nonchalant way but those were words I couldn\u2019t let slip by.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, what did you just say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHn? If you are not the one that is part of this then it means one of your sisters is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me that \u2018Hn?\u2019! If you do anything to my sisters I will not go easy on you!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them acted like nothing had changed. For them to have resolved to accept this kind of situation beforehand is not possible. And without even caring about it, this guy just says that it would take one of those two. Don\u2019t mess with me.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you know, you are the Misumi family\u2019s eldest son, Misumi Makoto-kun right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Why does it know my name?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe kids of the Misumi\u2019s household should have heard of this, is what I was told thought?\u201d</p><br/><p>The voice seemed to be one level more troubled than before. I was a bit surprised by this voice. Even when it kidnapped me out of nowhere it still tried to respect my will.</p><br/><p>With this\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWell you see. For now, can you tell me your name?\u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. I have somehow managed to not fall into panic but it\u2019s not like I am calm.</p><br/><p>I am just somehow calm, is a better way to say it. I have to settle down a bit.</p><br/><p>I still didn\u2019t even know the identity of that voice.</p><br/><p>\u201c??. Fumu, you are right. I apologize for not introducing myself. I am called Tsukuyomi.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see, Tsukuyomi. Tsukuyomi\u2026 Tsukuyomi?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOya, do you know? You are quite knowledgeable\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne of the three Shinto gods, \u2018that\u2019 Tsukuyomi no Mikoto?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOooh, that\u2019s right. Compared to the other two I am a minor character though.\u201d</p><br/><p>Well that is true. But even with that it\u2019s still a big name.</p><br/><p>I like myths and history (though only a bit), that\u2019s why, if what the voice said is true, then it is quite the character.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor that Tsukuyomi-sama to know me, why is that so?\u201d</p><br/><p>To start with, the thing I understand the least. In a sense, I didn\u2019t understand why I was chosen to travel to another world.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I see, you really don\u2019t know anything. Alright, I will tell you.\u201d</p><br/><p>And then, the contents that were told, I honestly couldn\u2019t grab a hold of it.</p><br/><p>I was in a pretty fortunate position compared to the people that are called to another world, get lost or reincarnate, or so I thought.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

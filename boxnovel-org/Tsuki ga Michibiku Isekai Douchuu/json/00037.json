It should be them coming to report to me! In this world, there is something called thought connection and it\u2019s a skill that doesn\u2019t burden the receivers in any way, Tomoe and Mio can use that skill!</p><br/><p>Okay, then those two\u2026</p><br/><p>At the moment when I was thinking about opening a transmission\u2026</p><br/><p>(Waka! Waka! Are you okay?!)</p><br/><p>I heard the voice of a troublemaker that I hadn\u2019t heard for a long time.</p><br/><p>With a timing that told me that there was something going on.</p><br/><p>(Yes, yes, what happened~?) (Makoto)</p><br/><p>(What\u2019s with that unmotivated attitude?!) (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>(Eh~? If I hear the voice of a person I haven\u2019t heard for so long, moreover, in a loud voice asking me if I am okay, then~\u2026 I was busy but, do you need something~?) (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I push all dissatisfaction I had onto her.</p><br/><p>Seriously, for the person that left the report I had ordered her to do to the orcs and disappeared with no previous notice, your attitude is too conceited!</p><br/><p>(Mu, muu. Regarding that, I was making sure to get some results before reporting to you. It was a success-ja! For that reason, I needed the time-ja Waka~!) (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>I wonder about that~.</p><br/><p>She is the type that would go without eating just to buy a newly produced game after all. Even if you tell me that you tried your best, it doesn\u2019t convince me at all.</p><br/><p>You are the type of person that would say, \u2018I can make rice\u2019 with a straight face after all.</p><br/><p>(And? What is the urgent business you have with me?) (Makoto)</p><br/><p>(Yeah, I want you to come to Asora as soon as possible. Mio is in serious trouble-ja!) (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Mio?</p><br/><p>\u2026 Now that she mentions it, Mio hasn\u2019t gotten in touch with me since the time I left her.</p><br/><p>In situations similar to this, she would call me once every 30 minutes with thought transmission just to talk with me after all.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t tell me\u2026</p><br/><p>Did my magic power that was inside of her dry up and she has gone wild?!</p><br/><p>(Don\u2019t tell me she returned to being a spider and has begun going wild?!) (Makoto)</p><br/><p>(It\u2019s not such a lukewarm situation! It\u2019s the opposite-ja! Ei, Waka, just come here! If there is a person that can handle this, it\u2019s only Waka-ja!) (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>A situation that is even worse than that?! What does she mean by opposite?!</p><br/><p>Ah~, geez!</p><br/><p>While being overwhelmed with these emotions, I quickly enter an alley and after checking for any possible people around, I summon the mist gate.</p><br/><p>If I remember correctly, Mio should be at a material warehouse.</p><br/><p>I asked her to organize that place after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cTomoe-san! Continue, continue quickly!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMio, let\u2019s finish this for today, okay? Look, the outside is already dark. It\u2019s the time where you can meet with Waka again right?\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cThen it should be fine to continue until he comes back-desu!\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cEi, how long do you think I have been doing this?! This is the end, the end!\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Ara ara. Is that so? Then, I will be filling this crystal board that I don\u2019t understand, with scratches okay?\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Mio takes out a transparent board that had the size of an A4 paper. And she said that while slowly moving the iron-ribbed fan to it.</p><br/><p>Tomoe lets out a \u201cWaa!\u201d and other strange things that didn\u2019t make sense while wriggling her body in agony.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou! Mio! That is the CM cut that I went through all the trouble of removing the noise, the second volume of Mitokoumon Tokaido!\u201d (Tomoe) </p><br/><p>\u201cI want to see the continuation desu wa~ I really~ want to watch the continuation desu wa~\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cO-O-Oh! W-Wait, don\u2019t do anything rash! Besides, if you do something like that, I will never cooperate with you anymore! Is that okay with you?!\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way! If something like that happens, I\u2026 I will be shocked to a point where I would eat everyone here-desu wa!\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cW-W-W-What?!\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u2026 What the hell is going on?</p><br/><p>It seems that Mio is badgering about something, and Tomoe is trying to stop her?</p><br/><p>This is the place where Tomoe is regulating the images of my memories, or so she told me.</p><br/><p>Well, it must be something like a library or a data room.</p><br/><p>In such a place, the 2 top class people of Asora are bickering as if they were children.</p><br/><p>And she said that she removed the noise of a CM cut? Just what kind of video studio operator are you?</p><br/><p>I wonder in what state are my memories right now.</p><br/><p>Still, if that 1 board has 1 whole volume of Mitokoumon, then it would be a capacity that would even surprise the modern era. So that is the rumored super-crystal huh. Is it a valuable article like the Herkimer diamond? </p><br/><p>No no no.</p><br/><p>Right now is not the time for that.</p><br/><p>Uhm, is there no one else here?</p><br/><p>Oh, how unusual. The Arke-san is here.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, what in the world is going on here?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cWaka-sama, we, in the place where we met Waka-sama, were doing the organization and classification with Mio-sama\u201d</p><br/><p>Oh? The smattering words have become decent now. Impressive, you guys even learned the common language fast.</p><br/><p>Even when I tried so hard to learn it I couldn\u2019t. It makes me want to sulk.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, and?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the middle of it, Tomoe-sama returned and began something called appreciation\u201d</p><br/><p>Appreciation? Ah, art appreciation huh.</p><br/><p>Hey, Tomoe. Don\u2019t you have a lot of work piled up?</p><br/><p>I ask of you, for someone that stands on the top, please, act as !</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd Mio joined in\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Heeey! You are an accomplice as well?!</p><br/><p>\u201cBut after rebuking Tomoe-sama, she soon returned to work\u201d</p><br/><p>Oh, what an exemplar thing to do. Then, what is with this situation?</p><br/><p>\u201cMio-sama went to the data that was over there to organize it\u201d</p><br/><p>Ah, if I remember correctly, that is the part Tomoe said were the miscellaneous images of my memories.</p><br/><p>I have said it a lot of times but, that skill is pretty convenient. You can scan the life of a person you have met and you can store and watch it without having the memories deteriorate.</p><br/><p>It seems you can\u2019t read the emotions the person had at that time, but being able to store all the memories that you have experienced, is way too awesome.</p><br/><p>Depending on the use, it could be even more powerful than the ability that Tsukuyomi-sama gave me.</p><br/><p>Hah~, the explanation of the Arke-san is long. He is smattering while trying his best to talk with me in a polite manner, this gives me a good impression but\u2026</p><br/><p>When will you arrive at the main point?</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd then, it became like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Eeeeh?!</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t you omit all the important parts?!</p><br/><p>\u201cMio-sama turned stiff at that part. She dragged Tomoe-sama there. And that is how it became like this\u201d</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t understand the meaning.</p><br/><p>I said my thanks to them, and headed to the two \u2018loyal\u2019 followers that were there.</p><br/><p>Now that it has come to this, I should ask the people involved to tell me what is going on.</p><br/><p>\u201cTomoe, I have come. What is going on?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>A truly annoyed voice came out from me. Well, there is no helping it. It was an annoyed voice that surprised even me.</p><br/><p>\u201cO-Oh! Waka! Good thing you have come! Please stop this idiot!\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Waka-sama. For Tomoe-san to be the only one that can pass such a good time, isn\u2019t that something called favoritism?!\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?! This is a justifiable enjoyment that Waka has allowed me to do-ja!\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>For Tomoe only? Allowed?</p><br/><p>Hey hey, don\u2019t tell me that\u2026</p><br/><p>Following after Tomoe, Mio has also been enraptured by history dramas. That would be severe.</p><br/><p>Ah~, if what Mio is using as threat is a video of Mitokoumon, then that can\u2019t be the case.</p><br/><p>But, judging from their conversation, it has something to do with my memories though.</p><br/><p>\u201cCalm down!\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I reflexively shout.</p><br/><p>Two young blooming (looking) women shouldn\u2019t be bickering like they were kids!</p><br/><p>Furthermore, why should I be the one mediating?!</p><br/><p>The data room turns silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cEhem, so you have calmed down huh. Then Mio, first of all, return that to Tomoe\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Yes. I am sorry\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. That\u2019s good\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Tomoe has a pleased face as she hugs the Mitokoumon board.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd, Tomoe. Explain to me what is going on here. Especially the part about why I have to come here to resolve your quarrel\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cUh. Well, you see. By the time I came here in the afternoon, these people were already here so\u2026\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst of all, that part is strange. Why did the person that I have ordered several things to do, would come here first without even giving me a single report? Shouldn\u2019t you be going to where I am first?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cE-Ehm~. There were a few things I wanted to confirm\u2026\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cAppreciation to the history dramas?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cGeh! Well~, what great wisdom you hold\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Tomoe-san is *monyo monyo* and squirming about.</p><br/><p>So you were going \u2018let\u2019s take a break before reporting~\u2019 huh.</p><br/><p>Why is it that I am surrounded by such easy-going people like these? Geez.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd then, why is Mio\u2026, n, what is this?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>My eyes catch sight of a nostalgic video.</p><br/><p>If I remember correctly, this is an event in the mornings.</p><br/><p>Suupah Hirou Taimu! </p><br/><p>It\u2019s that kind of event. The time where the people wear ranger costumes and masks.</p><br/><p>Did they show history dramas at that time?</p><br/><p>If they were transmitting it, it would be in the early mornings though?</p><br/><p>\u201cWaka, that\u2019s it-de gozai masu. The reason\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cTomoe? What is with that worn-out face?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cMio is\u2026 Mio is using me as if I were a consumer electronic!\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Crying *yo yo yo*, Tomoe crumbled down onto the floor.</p><br/><p>W-What is this? Electronic you say, Tomoe-san, just how modern do you plan to become?!</p><br/><p>No wait, let\u2019s leave that for later.</p><br/><p>There is no lie in her awfully exhausted appearance.</p><br/><p>And, Mio is making a fake smile like that of a child who has done a prank and is trying to hide it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWaka-sama, I heard that you gave Tomoe the permission to watch history dramas. When we talk about Tomoe-san, it comes to light that she did her mission without following the procedures properly and ends up immersing herself in her video editing.\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>She returned but she didn\u2019t contact anyone because she was immersing herself in editing her video, I see. What kind of otaku are you?</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, that is a problem.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut! For something as fascinating as this, I can understand why she is like that.\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>The turn of affairs seems suspicious~.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs a follower, for the first time, I, will be asking Waka-sama something! Please give me permission to watch as well!\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>More like, aren\u2019t you already watching it? Before even asking for the permission.</p><br/><p>I see, they got me good. This was the reason for the negotiations with Tomoe.</p><br/><p>I made it so Tomoe couldn\u2019t see a part of my memories.</p><br/><p>\u2026 That is why Tomoe is able to watch the memories that I \u2018haven\u2019t prohibited\u2019 her to. And she can edit them. Without even a PC, what a skillful person.</p><br/><p>And, Mio saw something in the TV of my everyday life memories and got hooked to it.</p><br/><p>Mio.</p><br/><p>What I asked of you was to try and deal with the documents and petitions since you were able to understand the language~.</p><br/><p>Even if she can\u2019t read the Japanese characters. Since she is able to understand the way it\u2019s spoken, I thought she would be able to handle it, but\u2026</p><br/><p>What the hell?</p><br/><p>\u201cHistory dramas? I don\u2019t really mind.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cNot that! I don\u2019t have interest in such a thing!\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, Mio! What do you mean by \u2018such a thing\u2019-ja?! You are being rude! That is the truest essence of Japanese culture!\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>What? So Mio got hooked with something different huh. Let\u2019s push aside the complaint of Tomoe. More like, Japanese you say, I am somewhat trying to keep it a secret you know? Since my memories have been read, it is just a matter of time though. Right now I am managing it by saying that I am from a faraway country.</p><br/><p>For now, the only ones that have seen my raw memories are Mio and the Arkes, and also Tomoe.</p><br/><p>Something different huh\u2026</p><br/><p>This is\u2026 anime?</p><br/><p>Hey. Heyheyhey hey hey!</p><br/><p>This, you, that, seriously?!</p><br/><p>\u201cMio, you want to watch this?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>This is a series which doesn\u2019t lose in length to that of Tomoe.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I want to have the permission to watch this-desu!\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>She has a face filled with motivation! However, me. Why did you compile a series of this? I don\u2019t remember having this in my collection.</p><br/><p>I see, that person. A friend of archery at the summer of last year, forced me to watch it! It was practically torture! It was an endurance race where I was enclosed in an AV room with air conditioning!</p><br/><p>T-The more I remember, the bitter of a memory it becomes. I should have done something to him as revenge. However, a normal high school student shouldn\u2019t have the assets to buy a DVD compilation series. I don\u2019t have that kind of money! Damn you rich brat!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I get it. Tomoe, show this to Mio. I am already tired. I am going to sleep.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cWa-Waka?! Is it okay? More like, my own time will be reduc-!\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cI am truly grateful, Waka-sama!!\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cOh~\u2026\u2026 Those are called anime and they are drawings that move. Please try to differentiate it from reality~. For Tomoe, the report~\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the report, I still have a lot of things I have to talk about after all.</p><br/><p>I will be a merchant from now on you know? Of course, these two will be my followers. They will be like employees.</p><br/><p>However, one of them is a samurai or a brigand, or whatever she thinks she is and she is also a history drama otaku. And the other one is inexperienced in society and now she is even hooked on such a thing.</p><br/><p>The prospects look grim.</p><br/><p>I will have Tomoe report to me in a different room, by the time I finished lecturing her about her sudden disappearance, I was already thoroughly tired both mentally and physically.</p><br/><p>It would be troublesome if they discovered that I was not at the inn, so pushing myself, I brought my body to the inn\u2019s room. It had already became night. No, it could even be called late night.</p><br/><p>The nights in here become silent pretty fast.</p><br/><p>There aren\u2019t many people that spend all night making a racket.</p><br/><p>This town welcomes the silence of the night unexpectedly fast. That is why, it may still be 9-10 p.m but the atmosphere is that of late night.</p><br/><p>There are a lot of bars lined up close to the inns, they are leaving the lights on at a relatively late hour but, they are right now disappearing. In a bigger town there may be places of entertainment that are like the nightless cities though.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am tired~\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I open the window of the room and say a monologue to the outside.</p><br/><p>The chair that I was sitting on, was one of those that would rock back and forth.</p><br/><p>This was unexpectedly pleasant. I like it. It gives a much needed respite to my weakened heart.</p><br/><p>It was truly a day where I moved around everywhere.</p><br/><p>It has really been a long time since I have been this tired, both mentally and physically.</p><br/><p>I casually look at the inside of the room.</p><br/><p>There were two beds and one large couch.</p><br/><p>Normally, one of the followers should be sleeping in the couch while switching, but the two of them were going *suya suya* and sleeping comfortably in both beds.</p><br/><p>~ A past event ~</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind if you come sleep with any of us-desu zo.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201c*Nod Nod*!\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>Like I can do that!</p><br/><p>Today was a long day so I should just go sleep. That\u2019s right, it\u2019s definite. I am supposed to be a healthy high school boy, but for some reason, I don\u2019t feel any sexual desire for those two. Maybe it\u2019s because I know their original forms, or it might be because they are extremely problematic children.</p><br/><p>Might as well pass the night while walking outside. Passing the night while looking at the faint moon in the sky, how refreshing. It reminds me of Tsukuyomi-sama after all. And it also reminds me of the Bug, so the balance comes to zero.</p><br/><p>That Goddess. She seems to have spoken with Tsukuyomi-sama, maybe she is a God that is related to the moon? No way, I don\u2019t want her to rule over the moon. Without any meaning to trigger a flag, I seriously pray that that is not the case.</p><br/><p>I have already contacted the proper young man. Tomorrow we will be meeting at the front of the adventurer\u2019s guild.</p><br/><p>\u2018To be able to produce one of the elixirs, Ambrosia!\u2019, is what he said passionately and consented to it.</p><br/><p>The other members, seem to be taking a rest tomorrow.</p><br/><p>\u2018This place is so calming, since we are going to be staying here, we will be looking for a cheap and relaxing inn\u2019, is what they said.</p><br/><p>We are also going to be staying here for a while, so maybe we should rent a house, if it\u2019s possible I want to find something that resembles an apartment.</p><br/><p>Since I plan on being a merchant, I will need a carriage and a storehouse where I can deposit my goods.</p><br/><p>The things I have to do are clear, so tomorrow and the day after tomorrow will be busy days.</p><br/><p>I can tell that it will be a while before I can relax.</p><br/><p>The slightly cold autumn breeze envelops my body and gently permeates it. Leaving aside if there is actually something called autumn here, it is just a feeling I have.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am actually thinking that I should have a level-headed mind but\u2026\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>A self-deprecating voice. I didn\u2019t want to feel depressed, so I tried to avoid that topic though.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am troubled by the fact that my two followers awakened to two outrageous hobbies-de gozaru. I don\u2019t like it-de gozaru\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>In the end, I trembled slightly at the autumn night as I whispered while trying to escape reality. I fell into deep thinking.</p><br/><p>About the blue follower that had a sword fight hobby, and the black follower that has awakened to a new hobby, and me who will become a victim of those.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s sleep. Let\u2019s just sleep.</p><br/><p>\u2014-</p><br/><p>Author note:</p><br/><p>Now, a quiz-desu. What was Mio hooked by?</p><br/><p>Nah, that\u2019s a joke. There is practically no hint, moreover, I don\u2019t have plans on saying it until a later time so. ^^;</p><br/><p>I-It\u2019s not like I don\u2019t have something clear in mind okay?!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

But I can\u2019t take it any longer. I am leaving early\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sleep talking, Eris? Actually, increase the amount of doubles. The customers are coming as if it\u2019s the last spurt.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha, Akua, I am already a fallen rag. Even if you wring me out, nothing will drip. If I continue attending the customers in this state, even my cosmos will dry up.\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>\u201cSee, a regular of yours came. Smile smile.\u201d (Akua)</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, welcome~~!! Hah\u2026it has already been deeply ingrained in me!!\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>One hour before sunset.</p><br/><p>The Kuzunoha Company has received a big amount of customers today too, and the two girls with darkish skin were moving their feet as if there were several people existing, and were doing their best in attending their customers.</p><br/><p>The tall height Akua and the short Eris.</p><br/><p>Both of them were staggering already. There\u2019s Akua who was somehow enduring, and Eris who is despairing at the remaining time.</p><br/><p>The sales limit that the shopkeeper Raidou placed was the saving grace of those girls.</p><br/><p>Because there\u2019s that, they are able to see a goal.</p><br/><p>If they were selling goods with no limit, if they were to sell goods until closing time, the two of them would have probably fallen already.</p><br/><p>Raidou\u2019s sense for money as a merchant was dull, but this time, the sell limit he set up before going to the Demon Lord audience had coincidentally been a splendid choice.</p><br/><p>It could also be said to be a point that made the employees wring out their stamina to the limit.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s less than one hour now. Fight on, Eris. Even if you are all dried up, wring yourself out as if you were to break. And then, drink. Drink with everyone.\u201d (Akua)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Lime were here\u2026if at least Lime were here\u2026\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause of Tomoe-sama\u2019s orders, he is in Lorel at this moment. Don\u2019t ask for the impossible.\u201d (Akua)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I have decided. I will be drinking a lime flavored banana bliss today.\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe cocktail that Lime suggested huh. Even if he looks that way, he is unexpectedly a reliable man after all. About that alcohol, Waka-sama gave it a name, so maybe there\u2019s already a precedent though.\u201d (Akua)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026In a tankard.\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026It won\u2019t liberate you, you know. But I will accompany in one drink. Then let\u2019s have a drinking party today at Asora. Yeah, let\u2019s do our best.\u201d (Akua)</p><br/><p>\u201cSo number six was not enough. I have to wake up already. The ultimate cost.\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m telling you to stop sleep talking. Ah, welcome~! Today\u2026yes, that\u2019s right. I really did think that it was a bit fast for the season. Then, how about this one here?\u201d (Akua)</p><br/><p>\u201cI am expecting the souvenir to be expensive\u2026damn Lime!!!\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>The night was only beginning, but it was to the point that closing was in sight already.</p><br/><p>The Kuzunoha Company was prosperous.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u201cAchoo!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAra Lime, is that a cold?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, someone must have been gossiping about me.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt would be good if that\u2019s the case though. You are vigorous at night after all. I hope you won\u2019t get stabbed in time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is a different body from the one I use when acting separately from hero-dono\u2019s party. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>There\u2019s roof tiles and godowns, but in this strange scenery of a town that\u2019s slightly different from that of Japan, there\u2019s a male and female walking.</p><br/><p>The man is Lime Latte, a member of Kuzunoha Company, and currently acting together with the hero.</p><br/><p>The woman is Otonashi Hibiki.</p><br/><p>Entitled as a hero by the Limia Kingdom, and also the existence that serves as the hope of hyumans in the war between hyumans and demons.</p><br/><p>The shopkeeper of the Kuzunoha Company, Raidou -or Mizumi Makoto-, was in a relationship of senior and junior with her.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is not like I am telling you to stop indulging in women at night. I do think that if you are doing it fairly, I don\u2019t really mind.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh~, for a young woman, you are tolerant.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201cWudi has a wife and baby, and he is head-over-heels in love with her. Bredda doesn\u2019t seem to have the spirit to buy prostitutes. Looking at him, I think he doesn\u2019t have experience with women yet. I don\u2019t intend to tell him to play around with women, but I don\u2019t have much opinion of it either.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026There\u2019s still one more thing regarding Bredda, right?\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you could tell huh. He seems to like me. I am happy to be liked but\u2026I don\u2019t intend to answer his feelings.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cHow straight. Then I think telling him quickly would be kindness in itself.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf he confesses to me, I will properly reject him. To reject him because I have noticed his feelings, don\u2019t you think that would leave a bad aftertaste? He also has to properly resolve himself and say it. I think that putting an end to it in this way, will leave less regrets. Aren\u2019t men like that?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t know if to call you kind or strict. Well, it is not my business. I was the one who threw the conversation, but please do as you please.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>Lime lifts his hands up and shrugs his shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will do that. Sorry for having you accompany me today.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. The two are down with an endemic disease, so it can\u2019t be helped.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201cWudi and Bredda are unlucky. Or maybe Lime is the lucky one.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is without doubt me being lucky. That\u2019s why I am alive, and working at the Kuzunoha Company.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201cCan I hear about that?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind. Well, there\u2019s a lot I can\u2019t answer though.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What\u2019s that. In the first place, why are you in Lorel when you should be doing business at Rotsgard and Tsige?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>At the location that Hibiki and Lime were walking to, there\u2019s a building bigger than others.</p><br/><p>At the end of the long stairs, there\u2019s a temple.</p><br/><p>Their steps told that this is their objective.</p><br/><p>\u201cLorel\u2019s big shots are inviting my boss all the time. Telling him if he wants to put a store here. And so, I am doing a preliminary inspection. Being together with you guys was a coincidence, you know?\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>Lime\u2019s true objective is to investigate the movements of Hibiki and her party.</p><br/><p>But in order to have them think otherwise, he gives out a reason that Tomoe properly laid out beforehand.</p><br/><p>In that point, there were no holes.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe big shots huh. The names?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cHey hey, it feels like you are interrogating me. It is someone called Sairitz. You are free to confirm with the other party, but I ask you to keep it a secret that you heard this from me. If they learn that I am here to inspect, there will be a parade of thought transmissions and letters coming to Boss again. You are the senpai of Boss, right? Lending a bit of help to your kohai would be nice.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201cSairitz\u2026 Hmph~, understood. I won\u2019t bring out your name.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cCounting on that.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you are talking about senpai and kohai, I would want some helping hand for the senpai as well.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are the senpai, so I ask you to be a bit tolerant on that. Boss is filled to the brim busy, and is suffering.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What a troublesome kohai.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>The two walk up the wide stone stairs.</p><br/><p>At the center there\u2019s a handrail, and a lot of people are walking up.</p><br/><p>It can be seen at one glance that there were a lot of people on their pilgrimage.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven so\u2026Lorel is really enthusiastic about their Spirit religion. If I remember correctly, it is a Water Spirit. It is clearly receiving more believers than the Goddess.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cFor the commoners, they are the ones who have more appearance than the Goddess, and also, the High Spirits are a strong existence, so it is a religion that\u2019s plenty reasonable to direct their belief at. Also, even if I say it is a Spirit religion, Spirits are all serving the Goddess, it is in essence, a religion of the Goddess.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou seem to be\u2026quite knowledgeable.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cTo the point that you have a different impression of me now? Then let me add one more thing while at it. In the past, at the time when the demon race made its great march, the Earth and Fire Spirit that lend their help to them were called low Spirits because of it. In truth, the medium Spirits that possess will of their own, there are some that are called High Spirits but\u2026well, regarding these two, there aren\u2019t many hyumans or demons that continue their belief towards them though. Dwarfs are stubborn so they continue their faith towards the Earth Spirit, but because of their proficient arm in smithing, their eyes are not focused on it.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Impressive. Are the employees of Kuzunoha Company required to have these amount of knowledge before being allowed to enter?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder. In our place, we have a tendency to excel at one trait, so there\u2019s no real need to know things, as long as you have a specialty, you can manage to enter, probably.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201cThen maybe I should enter as well. With the connection of Misumi Makoto.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cA connection is not a talent. Is the job of a hero darker than it shows?\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201cPitch black. The environment is also close to the worst. Well, what\u2019s more important is if it\u2019s worth doing huh. I can\u2019t stop after all. Can\u2019t I work in the side lines? Even if it\u2019s by connection, I am confident that I will be an employee that can bring you benefits though.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cOur place doesn\u2019t accept being a side job. Too bad.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201cAra. Fuh~ we have finally arrived. Seriously, what a long stair. Chiya-chan said she is almost done but, what do you think?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf she can\u2019t handle this much, she would be lacking in training. Even if you ask me what I think, I can\u2019t say anything since I don\u2019t know what that Priestess is doing. I only tagged along with you here.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026You really don\u2019t know what Chiya-chan is doing?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Yeah, I don\u2019t.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, I will leave it at that.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not being trusted.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201cFufu.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>While doing small talk, Hibiki and Lime enter the temple.</p><br/><p>After doing a simple check and confirming their identity, they were led into a room inside the temple.</p><br/><p>The reason why they came -or more like Hibiki came- was because she was told that her party member, the Priestess Chiya\u2019s training would be finished by today. </p><br/><p>Even if she is young, she is a dependable comrade, and Hibiki herself has come to meet her.</p><br/><p>She wanted her party members Wudi and Bredda to come with her, but they are ill right now. That\u2019s why, for some reason, Hibiki came along with Lime, a Kuzunoha Company employee she met at Lorel.</p><br/><p>Even Hibiki could only say that she instinctively invited him.</p><br/><p>Because she felt that going alone would be dangerous.</p><br/><p>Lime didn\u2019t get agitated at the sudden invitation of the hero. He carefreely accepted to go along with her to her destination.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no better distance to accomplish the order of Tomoe to investigate the hero\u2019s movement, so his actions could be said to be obvious.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd? That Priestess-san, how does she get stronger?\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a secret.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf possible, I would be grateful if she were to grow able to defend herself.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201cGrateful? What do you mean by\u2014!!\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Hibiki\u2019s face showed agitation in one instant.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you noticed.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s strange.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cStrange huh. Well, if you are saying this out of instinct, that\u2019s pretty impressive. That, draw it out.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>Lime places a hand to the katana at his waist, and looks at the sword at the back of Hibiki.</p><br/><p>\u201cAn enemy? But Lorel has never received the invasion of the Demon race, not even once.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cWho knows. I don\u2019t know about the demons, but for now, it is a matter of fact that they have secluded the space. The place we are in right now could be called a separate space.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201cSecluding space? Are you saying a barrier has been activated?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how it is. But it is quite large-scale. I don\u2019t think this is a defensive mechanism of the temple. Someone must have set this up at the shadows of the temple, taking its time. That\u2019s how it feels.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>Lime calmly analyzes the situation.</p><br/><p>As a spy of the Kuzunoha Company, he didn\u2019t show any signs of being agitated or bewildered.</p><br/><p>He detected the abnormality faster than anyone, and had begun to think before anyone else.</p><br/><p>\u201c?!! Then, what about Chiya-chan?!\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, there\u2019s a high probability that she is in danger. That\u2019s why I tried asking how strong she has gotten.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of leisure is that! Lend me a hand. We will immediately go save her!\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Okay, I will lend it. Don\u2019t forget that word.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, it is fine to think of it as a debt. I will return it in time.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo no, there\u2019s no need to think of it in such an exaggerated manner. It is fine to just tell me what that Priestess-san was planning on obtaining. I have a nature of wanting to know things that I want to know no matter what, you see.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I will tell you while we move. You are a vanguard, right?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Hibiki asks after seeing the katana.</p><br/><p>Lime nods.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, even if it\u2019s side by side, or back to back, I will do a decent job at it.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>*Don*</p><br/><p>Hibiki kicks open the wooden door.</p><br/><p>The corridor showed a slight fluctuation as if warping, something it didn\u2019t show in the past.</p><br/><p>Different from a normal space, it was a scenery that was practically proving they were in an unstable place.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen follow me. I will have you do both side and back.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood. First, right or left? Hero-dono knows the place where the Priestess-san is, right?\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. Also, it is fine to call me Hibiki. Calling me Hero-dono is kind of itchy. For people that stand in the same battlefield, I actually don\u2019t want to be called in that way.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cHibiki huh. If you want me to call you that way, I don\u2019t really mind. Then, let\u2019s go.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. Horn!\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>Responding to the call of Hibiki, the silver belt that was wrapped around her waist summoned a type of wolf.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go to where Chiya-chan is. If you notice something, tell me.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>The wolf nods at the words of its master.</p><br/><p>It seemed like it was able to understand the meaning.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you were going to summon, tell me so. I got surprised there.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201cAra, I am sorry. I normally don\u2019t team up with temporary members, so I was indifferent about it.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Two people and one animal run.</p><br/><p>Just like what Lime said, the temple had become like a dungeon.</p><br/><p>There were times when the corridor went a different course, and doors that had no locks couldn\u2019t be opened. Also, there were mamonos appearing in the temple; something that would never happen.</p><br/><p>They were all hostile, and mercilessly attacked Hibiki\u2019s group who were trying to hurry.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are fighting with quite the leisure!! As I thought, you are not a simple employee!\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cI just have enough ability to be send to do a preliminary inspection in a foreign country. More importantly, counting that wolf-san over there, you possess power that doesn\u2019t shame the name of hero. I see you in a different light now!\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>But Hibiki\u2019s group didn\u2019t deal with them. They were all mostly defeated in one hit, and they were actually increasing their speed as time went.</p><br/><p>Lime was observing Hibiki at times, nodding at times, and following her perfectly.</p><br/><p>He followed Hibiki\u2019s speed without losing breath, moreover, looking at how he swung his sword as if reading her very breath, the phantom of her past companion surfaced in her mind, but she chased it away.</p><br/><p>Hibiki told herself: \u2018Naval won\u2019t return\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, looks like it is here?\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Wah?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>(This guy is incredible. His breathing is not affected at all. Moreover, he is acting in a way that doesn\u2019t get in my way. He is really like Naval. No, he is most likely a lot more skilled than her.) (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Even though Hibiki was the one running ahead, she was surprised that she was more tired than Lime who was following from behind, and was also surprised by his movements.</p><br/><p>\u201cShould we rest for a bit? It seems the Priestess-san is safe, you know?\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>While recovering her breath, Hibiki silently shakes her head.</p><br/><p>(Also, it is the same with me. I felt like I was clearly stronger than normal. Is this person, Lime, the one that brought out that power from me? No way, there\u2019s no way that\u2019s the case but\u2026) (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>She does a big sigh.</p><br/><p>And then, when Hibiki lifts her gaze, there\u2019s the back of Lime.</p><br/><p>For some reason, that back of his looked quite big in Hibiki\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, the heart\u2019s eye? Or was it the mind\u2019s eye? I\u2019m surprised she was able to endure with only that power. She didn\u2019t seem especially strong in fights after all, that Priestess-san.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>Lime makes a reference of the new power of the Priestess that he heard from Hibiki in the way. The name of the power that Hibiki told Lime was the mind\u2019s eye. The eye of the heart.</p><br/><p>The power to see through the real appearance of the target without exceptions; a power that only the Priestess possesses. But Hibiki was hiding one thing from Lime.</p><br/><p>That the mind\u2019s eye is a power akin to a side effect.</p><br/><p>The objective of this time\u2019s ceremony was to enhance power in all aspects, and by doing that process, she also ends up obtaining the mind\u2019s eye.</p><br/><p>Hibiki didn\u2019t tell Lime about the power enhancement.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026, no, let\u2019s go!!\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Hibiki almost told everything to Lime.</p><br/><p>But just as she was about to, she stops.</p><br/><p>It is certainly true that they cooperating now, but Lime Latte is a member of the Kuzunoha Company.</p><br/><p>And in the eyes of Hibiki, the Kuzunoha Company is an incredibly dangerous existence.</p><br/><p>She felt it was dangerous to reveal everything.</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201c!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lime complies, and then opens the big door.</p><br/><p>At that place, there\u2019s the figure of Chiya on her knees, both hands put together, and her eyes closed making a prayer.</p><br/><p>Then, she saw the strong barrier that was protecting her.</p><br/><p>\u201cDemons huh. Why is it, I feel like this doesn\u2019t give off the smell of something planned. It is not good, and it is not like them either.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>Lime mutters.</p><br/><p>In his eyes, there were reflected three demons surrounding the Priestess\u2019 barrier.</p><br/><p>Lime could tell that she was breathing in and forming a spell.</p><br/><p>At her surroundings, there\u2019s the corpses of the Priestess\u2019 bodyguards.</p><br/><p>From the scenery that was reflected in his eyes, Lime felt some sort of occurrence involved in this ill-preparedness.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait. Right, the mind\u2019s eye huh. Because of her acquiring that ability, she saw things that she didn\u2019t think would see, and that\u2019s why those three got agitated and did this huh. Then this state is also\u2026\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!!\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lime was analyzing the situation from the information.</p><br/><p>But it seems he was the only one who was calm.</p><br/><p>Lime who heard an angered voice from his right side, looks at the direction where Hibiki should be.</p><br/><p>The silver belt suddenly shone and wraps her whole body.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Lime felt a strange upsurge of power, and in the next moment, Hibiki\u2019s figure had disappeared.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, even in the eyes of Lime that were trained by Tomoe, Hibiki looked like she had disappeared.</p><br/><p>Lime unconsciously felt something cold at his back.</p><br/><p>\u201cGyaaa!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Seriously?\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>Hearing the scream at the front, Lime learned of Hibiki\u2019s whereabouts.</p><br/><p>She was at the side of Chiya\u2019s barrier.</p><br/><p>And there were three corpses of demons as well.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t as if they could react to it.</p><br/><p>Luckily, only the third one was able to scream because he \u2018hit\u2019 the barrier by reflex. The other two weren\u2019t even able to react at all, and were severed in one strike.</p><br/><p>The one who was able to scream as well, it clearly showed that he received a fatal hit from one attack.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t turn into an instant death, that\u2019s all.</p><br/><p>In no time, the demon spat out a large amount of blood and died.</p><br/><p>(Good grief. It is the proper practice to let one live and have it spill out the beans. For Hibiki, that Priestess might be a special existence. In that case, if there\u2019s a need to restrain her, that Priestess might be useful. There\u2019s no real need to take her hostage; just by mentioning it to her, her movements would dull. Even so\u2026that was unbelievable speed. Like that, I wouldn\u2019t be able to react. If dealt wrong, I would also be defeated in an instant. I am glad I got to see it\u2026along with that incredible outfit. It is more eye candy than scary. Let\u2019s admire it.) (Lime)</p><br/><p>Lime places the entire movements of Hibiki in his head. Counting the Priestess\u2019 existence, the strong barrier she created, and the super speed that might be Hibiki\u2019s ace.</p><br/><p>\u2026And also the really high exposure rate outfit she uses when showing that speed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you okay, Chiya-chan?!\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cHibiki-oneechan! You came! You really came~!!\u201d (Chiya)</p><br/><p>The barrier crumbles, and Hibiki and Chiya hug each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad! I\u2019m truly glad I made it in time! It is alright now, I am here.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was scary, but I believed that you would definitely come rescue me! That\u2019s why I had my barrier up all the time and doing my best!\u201d (Chiya)</p><br/><p>Chiya\u2019s way of dealing with the situation was truly childish, and at the same time, it could be said to be truly composed and brave.</p><br/><p>Instead of going to a poor offensive, the chances of a mistake are low, and it will assure that she will live longer.</p><br/><p>The price is that she wouldn\u2019t be able to eliminate the enemy, so her chances of survival hinged on how much you can rely on someone coming to help.</p><br/><p>Chiya betted on the help, and she splendidly won the bet.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for ruining your heartwarming reunion, but how about returning for now, you two? Watching a child and a young girl hugging each other at a blood filled altar, is a bit unsavory.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026you are right. Lime, you really helped me out in this occasion. Thanks.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cNot really. I did properly get the compensation, so minding it too much will only tire me, please stop it. If it\u2019s not enough to show your gratefulness, invite me a dinner. I will be fine with that. Hm? What\u2019s wrong, Priestess-san?\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026A large tree that raises up a forest. Also\u2026a dragon and welcoming rain.\u201d (Chiya)</p><br/><p>Chiya suddenly mutters this with distant eyes as she looks at Lime.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Ah?\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201cChiya-chan?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cA person that gives a lot of peace of mind\u2026\u201d (Chiya)</p><br/><p>\u201cHibiki, it seems the Priestess is quite tired. Quickly finish reporting this and have her rest. No matter the circumstances, she is still a child after all.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, I will do that. Chiya-chan, can you stand?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine. Onee-chan is\u2026Onee-chan. Amazing, nothing changed.\u201d (Chiya)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Really?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d (Chiya)</p><br/><p>Hibiki and Lime look at each other.</p><br/><p>Wondering about Chiya-chan who is for some reason laughing happily.</p><br/><p>The three leave the abnormal space of the temple\u2019s altar, and head to the temple\u2019s waiting room.</p><br/><p>Lime was making a thinking expression as he walked, and suddenly lifted his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right, it might be troublesome if they learn that I am here, so I will be leaving first. See ya, Hibiki, Priestess-san.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a moment, you are an involved party as well!\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cLime-san!!\u201d (Chiya)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is fine to just have it as if I wasn\u2019t there and take the credit. Hibiki, don\u2019t forget the dinner. I will be returning to the inn.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>Lime says this rapidly, and leaves the two at the waiting room.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat Priestess-san, it seems the mind\u2019s eye sees something without regards to the other party\u2019s mind protection. I should report this as well. This is bad, it is almost time to submit the report to Sis! I have to go to a place without people and return quickly!!\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>At the Lorel Union, Lime was involved with Hibiki bit by bit.</p><br/><p>He still didn\u2019t notice that this one incident would unexpectedly deepen his friendship with those girls.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

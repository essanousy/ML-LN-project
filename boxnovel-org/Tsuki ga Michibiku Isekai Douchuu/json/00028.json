I have college and work. I have been tired as of late and I have been catching up with the novels I couldn\u2019t read lately.</p><br/><p>So here it is, a bit late but its here\ud83d\ude1b (Not like there\u2019s a schedule for them though)</p><br/><p>Enjoy the chapter\ud83d\ude00</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2013</p><br/><p>[You leave me no choice. Then, I will be doing the last one] (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?!\u201d (Rinon)</p><br/><p>The first thing that came out was the wonder of Rinon.</p><br/><p>*fidget*fidget. Just how low are her expectations of me?</p><br/><p>\u201cU-Um Raidou-san? We will be doing as well you know?! Let\u2019s ask Mio do it!\u201d</p><br/><p>The other people are also desperately trying to stop.</p><br/><p>A tear-jerking assessment must mean something like this.</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t even collect raw materials so I can tell how much of a novice they think I am.</p><br/><p>I rummage for my bow and arrow and take them out. I exchange looks with Mio and stop the carriage.</p><br/><p>As expected of the bicorn horse-san. He isnt even fazed by the strong looking bugs that are heading straight to us. He is listening to my orders by the letter.</p><br/><p>Uhm, the ant\u2019s weak point was the head right? Where was it for the bees?</p><br/><p>[Uhm, the weak point of the Size Ant\u2019s the head right? The one called Rubee-eye, was it the head?] (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I told you its impossible!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, for the Rubee-eye, its no good if you only aim at the head!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t heard about them, to fight them is\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>They are really telling me off. I will cry you know? But, they certainly did tell me not to aim for the head, I messed up a bit.</p><br/><p>[Its fine, just tell me where I should be aiming at for the Rubee-eye, please] (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cUwa\u2026 This guy intends to shoot without even knowing the range of a bow!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease, we can still convince Mio to do it\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 The weakness of the Rubee-eye, if I remember correctly, its the abdomen-desu\u201d (Toa)</p><br/><p>\u201cHey Toa?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Toa silences the noisy bunch. Umu, this girl has good eyes. It seems that she was able to see my ability the moment I took a stance with the bow. Fufu, I am scared of myself.</p><br/><p>The head and the abdomen huh.</p><br/><p>Hmph, with \u2018how close\u2019 they are, there is no way for me to miss.</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s just archery it would be another case, but I also master the art of archery. If its necessary I can even do close quarter combat. Ah, that\u2019s right. Next time, lets ask the dwarfs-san to make \u2018that\u2019 for me.</p><br/><p>I am of course, used to moving enemies.</p><br/><p>I prepare my bow. There are still a lot of arrows that the dwarfs gave me. There is no problems with this equipment.</p><br/><p>(Hey hey, Toa?!)</p><br/><p>(Shut up! It looks like he is concentrating) (Toa)</p><br/><p>(No, like I am telling you, its impossible. This distance is something only magic can manage)</p><br/><p>(And also, he is a level 1. What is he thinking?)</p><br/><p>These bunch, h-how disrespectful. The words of the calm elf-looking girl pierce right though my heart. Even though she calls Mio with honorifics!</p><br/><p>But from the 10 enemies I have already locked on 6 of them.</p><br/><p>7, 8, 9\u2026</p><br/><p>Then, lets answer the expectations of Toa-san.</p><br/><p>Is what I thought but\u2026</p><br/><p>(If push comes to shove we still have Mio-sama with us) (Toa)</p><br/><p>(Oh, I see. We are going to let him do what he wants and have her move out)</p><br/><p>(Also, he might be someone awesome if Mio-sama left it to him)</p><br/><p>(\u2026 No no no\u2026 That\u2019s impossible for a level 1)</p><br/><p>(It\u2019s not Raidou-san, it\u2019s that bow. It may be an incredible object. It may have something like aiming or critical that will kill them off in one hit) (Toa)</p><br/><p>(\u2026 I see, I didn\u2019t think about that. Certainly, leaving the bow aside, the arrows are pretty well made)</p><br/><p>The damn that keeps the tears of my heart might break down at any point. You go straight to denying my own ability?</p><br/><p>It\u2019s the bow huh!</p><br/><p>Should I make you all aiming targets?! All you fools\u2026 uh\u2026</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t care anymore! Just watch and be amazed!</p><br/><p>\u201cOnii-chan, are you okay?\u201d (Rinon)</p><br/><p>Jeez, I am beginning to see Rinon as the sweetest girl here.</p><br/><p>The distance is around a 100 meters huh.</p><br/><p>I have finished locking on all the enemies. Lets begin with the bees.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Fu~\u201d</p><br/><p>I quietly let out the air in my lungs. And then, the first arrow. From the two Rubee-eye that were leading the group, one was brought down.</p><br/><p>Following that, another one. Of course, the bee from just now had a hole in its abdomen and fell to the ground.</p><br/><p>3, 4, 5\u2026</p><br/><p>I was smoothly locking them on and bringing them down.</p><br/><p>From my back I could hear things like \u2018No way\u2019 or \u2018What is going on?\u2019, did you see that you bastards?</p><br/><p>Do you understand now? When I use a bow I am pretty incredible you know?</p><br/><p>I may have the worst face but in my department I can be considered the best.</p><br/><p>8, 9\u2026</p><br/><p>With this one it\u2019s the end, *tou.</p><br/><p>The last ant\u2019s head is pierced.</p><br/><p>It has been 30 seconds.</p><br/><p>The enemy was surprised by the first attack so they stopped their movements, by the time I began my moves it was already over.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t let a single one get close. I defeated them all with one hit! Don\u2019t underestimate the super-strong long range class!</p><br/><p>Umu, I am a bit rusty in my loading speed but my accuracy has no change. I haven\u2019t been to Asora for a while so I haven\u2019t been able to practice my bow, I am relieved now.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Incredible\u201d (Rinon)</p><br/><p>I thank you for your honest opinion Rinon. With this they should have changed their opinion of me. Umu umu.</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s as easy as this. Have you changed your way of seeing me?] (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I say it to the bunch at the back. More like, I will show them all that this bow has no special traits to it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn-credible. Even though I only see it as a normal bow\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s-why-I-am-saying it\u2019s NOT the bow!</p><br/><p>Just how much is their disbelief? Is being a level 1 such a deciding factor? Damn it.</p><br/><p>[\u2026 This bow is a normal bow. By the way, the arrows are made by skilled artisans but there is no magic in them. I have been specialized in the bow since little] (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Saying that, I give the bow and arrow to them. I did an incredible act and yet, for some reason, my heart feels dejected.</p><br/><p>I order Mio and have us advance through the place where the corpses are.</p><br/><p>Heh~ Its true, this one is different from the Red Bee, the eyes shine like gems. Rubee-eye, I understand now.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis, the making was done well but, without doubt, there is no magic placed in them\u201d</p><br/><p>An alchemist young man checked my bow and said his conclusion. Of course, I forgot his name.</p><br/><p>And to remember the name of a rude person, I will not remember them anymore. To not believe what they have seen with their own eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Imposible\u201d</p><br/><p>An elf woman that uses a bow just as me, whispered lowly. Her name is on the lowest of my priorities.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe strength, range, accuracy, I have never seen such a thing\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight\u201d (Toa)</p><br/><p>Toa shares the same opinion. They were thinking it was the tools performance all this time so this must be out of their expectations. </p><br/><p>I am also a level 1 after all.</p><br/><p>[Everyone, is it fine now? Lets collect the materials quickly and head to Tsige] (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Going ahead, I move next to the Size Ant and cut off the sharp foreleg that looks like a sickle while I hurry the 4 people that were checking out the bow.</p><br/><p>At these times, having writing to communicate is good. If I just write it in the place I want then I can transmit what I want, even in places where my voice can\u2019t reach.</p><br/><p>I am not used to calling people in a high voice.</p><br/><p>The four people come hurriedly.</p><br/><p>It must be because we have been together for several weeks, even though they are not in a party of any sort, they have formed a collective feel in them.</p><br/><p>And after that, in the time we were arriving to Tsige.</p><br/><p>The 4 people that were looking at me as if I were a different person, it felt a bit pleasant.</p><br/><p>When Rinon saw through my feelings and said \u2018Isn\u2019t it great?\u2019 I felt a bit embarrassed.</p><br/><p>It has been three weeks since the destruction of the base. It has already been two weeks since we came \u2018here\u2019.</p><br/><p>When the day was already at its zenith.</p><br/><p>We finally arrived at Tsige. It was the first place that looked like a proper town since I came to this world.</p><br/><p>\u2014-</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?! The \u2018Zenno\u2019 base has been destroyed?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Toa-san reports the details to the adventurer guild.</p><br/><p>Of course, she didn\u2019t report the whole truth about it.</p><br/><p>I had 3 other adventurers inserted as well, make a good story and have their stories match.</p><br/><p>I haven\u2019t told Toa-san and Rinon about what I did. She must be thinking that her story matches that of other people.</p><br/><p>Anyways, that town, no, that base had such a name like \u2018Zenno\u2019, it\u2019s the first time I have heard of that.</p><br/><p>The average level was over 100, for a town of hyumans that place was quite the place. If you think that those kind of people had disappeared in a moment, it\u2019s actually an impressive occurrence.</p><br/><p>Well, it was a place that ran in a dirty way.</p><br/><p>These people as well, in the end, were sacrifices for those evil merchants or nobles (because of various reasons I wasn\u2019t able to obtain the name of the one behind all)</p><br/><p>That may be why but, it seems that the people here don\u2019t have that much of an attachment to that place.</p><br/><p>Rinon is also like that but\u2026 it seems that Toa-san had her own reasons.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t have any objections in leaving that place but it seems that she has some lingering feelings.</p><br/><p>By the way, the story that was made was incredibly random.</p><br/><p>Just a single thing. The big outbreak of mamonos.</p><br/><p>Even though it wasn\u2019t that strange of an occurrence given the place, I felt it sounded like a web-novel event.</p><br/><p>And so, we ran away for our lives and arrived here.</p><br/><p>Also the guild that my two followers had registered to, wasn\u2019t able to relay the information of them to the other guilds so the information of Tomoe and Mio\u2019s cards has disappeared.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know how they do it but how sloppy of them.</p><br/><p>When I asked the details from the base that was near it, they said that the establishment of the base at the borders that shares the information, can\u2019t leave the place so it\u2019s normal for the information to travel slowly.</p><br/><p>When I asked them where this establishment was, they said that it was in Tsige and that we could redo the registration of the two.</p><br/><p>Because of the circumstances we had to go through 3 other bases but they were all village level, no, it gave me the impression of a campground.</p><br/><p>I will call back Tomoe tonight, tomorrow I will have both of them do the registration again, and then I will go to the merchant guild.</p><br/><p>Today I will look for an inn and check out the shops\u2026</p><br/><p>Wu wu, finally, finally I have arrived at a town! I have a lot of things I want to do!</p><br/><p>The person in charge that was listening to the four people, nodded his head, told them to wait and then went inside.</p><br/><p>He probably went to look for a higher up. It\u2019s a pretty important issue after all, for a base to be gone.</p><br/><p>Mio didn\u2019t join in the conversation and was just standing beside me with Rinon. I don\u2019t want another problem caused by my appearance.</p><br/><p>Now that I think about it, just how high is the strongest level and rank in this place?</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a quite big and pretty well made building so it\u2019s hard to look for it\u2026 Oh, there it is. There is no need for me to be there when they report so, I just go there for a second.</p><br/><p>I direct my eyes to a side of the request board. From the people that are not so hurried I can tell that this is the place.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s see, the number 1 here is\u2026</p><br/><p>Level 201, Rank S.</p><br/><p>Fumu, as expected, it\u2019s low. A starter is a starter and my followers are my followers after all. I don\u2019t even know what the standard is anymore.</p><br/><p>The quest are also pretty low in rank.</p><br/><p>With how this is, the rank S are probably requested personally to an individual or a party.</p><br/><p>Most of the ones left are A or B so the parties are mostly fighting over the D to B\u2019s, maybe?</p><br/><p>Anyways, the collecting quests that are rank A are a lot, impressive.</p><br/><p>They must be absurdly tiresome, are they requesting to gather something like lost metals?</p><br/><p>\u2026 Either way, I don\u2019t like it. I don\u2019t want to do it either.</p><br/><p>But, I should ask which one is easier to go for the collecting types at the very least. I feel that I can \u2018use\u2019 that.</p><br/><p>At \u2018Zenno\u2019, because of the evil schemes that Tomoe had and a lot of other circumstances I didn\u2019t have the chance to do it. She told me that her individual mobilization is advancing somehow but we have to start for real now.</p><br/><p>N? How unusual, there is an S rank left. I couldn\u2019t reach it with my height so I jumped a bit and take the request.</p><br/><p>Maybe I stood out a bit, the surroundings grew noisy. Well, there seemed to be no one taking it so there wasn\u2019t any competition over it.</p><br/><p>Lets see, what is it?</p><br/><p>\u2018I ask of you! We need at least 1 Rubee-eye eye. To finish we need 6 of them. We will surely give you a large sum of money for them. Rembrandt Company\u2019</p><br/><p>Timely!</p><br/><p>Moreover, a person from a company huh. This is good. I am lucky. What if I make personal connections from the get go?</p><br/><p>Their name is Rembrandt Company so maybe it\u2019s a pretty big business. It\u2019s an S rank request so the reward must be quite high.</p><br/><p>Umu, I should tell this to the other guys and have them give me all of the Rubee-eye eyes. I was the one who hunted them so there shouldn\u2019t be any problems.</p><br/><p>If it comes to it I can even take them by force. After all, even if they all come at me, Mio alone can mess them up, kukuku *evil smile*</p><br/><p>\u201cOnii-chan, you look a bit scary\u201d (Rinon)</p><br/><p>\u201cWaka-sama, an evil plan-desu ka?\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>The scared Rinon and the \u2018count me in\u2019 Mio. The side of Rinon hurts me.</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s not it Rinon. I just found an interesting request] (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph~, ah, Onee-chan and the others!\u201d (Rinon)</p><br/><p>The talk is over huh.</p><br/><p>When I look, there is certainly 4 people coming here.</p><br/><p>I glance at the rank table for a bit.</p><br/><p>When I think about it, if it\u2019s the top 10 then Toa and the dwarf girl can enter in it. So they can enter in the strong part even when they are like that. Umu\u2026</p><br/><p>Honestly, I can only think of them as a noisy bunch.</p><br/><p>The person of the guild seems to not be here. It looks like it didn\u2019t become a troublesome matter.</p><br/><p>\u2018To explain the situation\u2019 was a request that we got in the previous base. They showed the document to prove that, so this is practically a direct request from the guild.</p><br/><p>They look quite happy about that.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am back, Rinon. You didn\u2019t cause any troubles to the two of them right?\u201d (Toa)</p><br/><p>\u201cI was behaving properly!\u201d</p><br/><p>The conversation of sisters~ how nice~ having a sister. I had too but, no, I can\u2019t think about that.</p><br/><p>Rinon was being a really good girl.</p><br/><p>[Welcome back, did you finish the request properly?] (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, thanks to you. But are you okay with it? I think that the 2 of you could receive the reward for completing the request\u201d (Toa)</p><br/><p>I am grateful for the consideration of Toa-san but, if I said that \u2018We have increased our rank while you weren\u2019t here Tomoe, we took a request, and did our best\u2019</p><br/><p>I am sure it will become an annoying situation.</p><br/><p>If I think about the situation and atmosphere until now, I feel that even if we don\u2019t try so hard for it, we will be able to increase our rank.</p><br/><p>[No no, our reputation as adventurers is too low so, this time I will give it to you guys] (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I see! With this as trade condition, I can get the eyes! </p><br/><p>\u201cFor all the things you have done for us, I am truly grateful\u201d</p><br/><p>What a proper young man.</p><br/><p>\u201cExperience, money, rank and materials, you have truly helped us out. I pray that Raidou-dono can have the blessing of the spirits\u201d</p><br/><p>The dwarf girl.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me where you learned to use the bow later\u201d</p><br/><p>The elf girl. That is impossible.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks to you, we have increased our level and rank. Its like a dream. Here here\u201d (Toa)</p><br/><p>Toa-san. Her caution is fading~</p><br/><p>Lets see. Everyone is happily showing me their guild cards.</p><br/><p>Toa-san is level 125, Rank A, Shadow Thief. What does Shadow Thief mean? What a dangerous name, there is no doubt I don\u2019t want to get close to something like that.</p><br/><p>The dwarf girl is, level 122, Rank B+, Priest Warrior (Earth). It must mean that she is a knight that can use earth spirits.</p><br/><p>The proper young man is, level 114, Rank B+, Alchemy Meister. Can\u2019t they just call it alchemist? It sounds like he can even ride a Gundam, oi.</p><br/><p>The elf girl is, level 108, Rank A-, Bless Gunner. A gunner you say? She uses guns?! But you are holding a bow?! This world had guns?!</p><br/><p>Certainly. Every one of them has leveled up.</p><br/><p>The elf girl was not even level 100 after all, she leveled up quite a bit.</p><br/><p>That means that, I, who has worked so hard, must have increased at least 30 levels, maybe?</p><br/><p>[Our business here is over so let\u2019s leave. Or, do you guys still have something to do here?] (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have any but, Mio-sama and Raidou-san must register\u201d</p><br/><p>All of them nod simultaneously. Impressive synchronization.</p><br/><p>Why is it that you guys are looking forward to it?</p><br/><p>[We plan on doing that when Tomoe reunites with us so, we are not going to do it today. Tomoe will sulk if we don\u2019t do that] (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf its Tomoe-san, she would sulk. You are right\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Mio also understands very well that point.</p><br/><p>Even though she is taking separate conduct right now, she is the type that would mind if we don\u2019t do the critical things together.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh~? I wanted to see everyone surprised though~!\u201d (Toa)</p><br/><p>Toa-san, what an irresponsible thing to say.</p><br/><p>[We are going to come here tomorrow so, if you are here tomorrow you will be able to see] (Makoto)</p><br/><p>It\u2019s sudden but we are in different lodgings, no, we are separating, that\u2019s how this is.</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t carry them around all the time after all.</p><br/><p>Because our objective is to have a pleasure trip around the various countries, or something like that.</p><br/><p>Also, it seems that in this world you can\u2019t make a party with other adventurers if there is a certain difference of level between them.</p><br/><p>The system that the adventurers utilize to make big parties, it\u2019s too unbalanced for us.</p><br/><p>If I\u2019m not mistaken\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 You are right, until now we had to accompany you but, certainly, from now on our destinations are going to differ a lot\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRaidou-dono, its hard to believe but if he is going to be walking the path of a company business then it will certainly be different\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf the level difference is of 20 or more, it won\u2019t be allowed\u201d</p><br/><p>It was 20 huh. Then Tomoe and Mio can\u2019t form one either.</p><br/><p>[Yeah, that\u2019s why, lets eat something light for lunch and distribute the luggage of the carriage. After that we will be going our ways for now] (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cFor now?\u201d (Toa)</p><br/><p>Toa-san asks me back with a hint of expectation. I can\u2019t answer that expectation though, I have some kind of feelings as well so, I am thinking about it too.</p><br/><p>[If everyone is not in a hurry, we can go together for lunch and then do a farewell party. In commemoration for the success of your guild request] (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are in!\u201d</p><br/><p>I thank you for your consent.</p><br/><p>\u201cWaka-sama. I don\u2019t want something like last time-desu yo\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Mio, I understand what you are trying to say. This time we will be going to a bar-like place to munch as much as we want.</p><br/><p>Also, we have been eating preserved food and a lot of other things that had no flavor so.</p><br/><p>[You are right, Mio. Everyone has come here in the past right?] (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Each one of them nods. Then I will leave it to them.</p><br/><p>[Then I will leave it to you guys, so please choose a place where we can eat a lot of food and drink at ease. I will be eagerly expecting it] (Makoto)</p><br/><p>[Of course, a place that is fine for Rinon-chan to be] (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I add words to what I said.</p><br/><p>Then, the night has been decided so, for now its lunch. A place where we can lightly pick up and distribute, where we can converse huh. Umu, let\u2019s have them do that as well.</p><br/><p>[Then, let\u2019s go] (Makoto)</p><br/>\n</div>"}

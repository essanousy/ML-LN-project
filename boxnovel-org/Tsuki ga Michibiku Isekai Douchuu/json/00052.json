The other way would be leaving it as Onis, but that is practically the same as saying Ogre since I see Onis as muscular as well.</p><br/><p>I could also call them demons, but since the demon race already exists and they are a completely different race\u2026 Calling them forest demons might be changing the context a bit too much.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am Akua\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEris\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them had sports drinks.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s been a long time since I have drunk any. To drink after club activities was the best.</p><br/><p>There were a lot of things I wanted to *tsukkomi* about. Even the name of forest ogre A and B were interesting. </p><br/><p>Being released from the forest ogres\u2019 elders, I was treated as a guest and given a room. They gave me a pretty good room and even did a welcoming party. For now, it seems that we have a good relation.</p><br/><p>On top of abridging the story quite a bit, I even mixed in some lies. I feel a bit bad about it, but I can\u2019t tell them that I punched Shen or that we destroyed the whole base, so I had no choice. Yeah, no choice at all.</p><br/><p>The girls that showed me the way, for some reason, introduced themselves and aren\u2019t showing any signs of leaving the room. There\u2019s no problems in leaving already though. More like, I want you to get out.</p><br/><p>For four people to be in one room and I am the only man? That\u2019s a no no.</p><br/><p>\u2026 Because I feel like it would be tiring to keep them company.</p><br/><p>I have already confirmed that they are people who don\u2019t hear others\u2019 talks. Wasn\u2019t it fine to hear what I had to say for even a second?</p><br/><p>The way Akua-san uses the bow is in the rough side and she looks like the type that would make a move at any time.</p><br/><p>The mysterious girl that uses a short cane, Eris-san. She gives out the aura of a crazy person.</p><br/><p>This time, the Maid Ane-sama search is a total fail. Well, their outward appearance is kind of exotic, so it\u2019s fine. Akua-san\u2019s high school height compared to the grade school height of Eris-san. It\u2019s a perfectly uneven combination, is what I would have thought.</p><br/><p>Sadly, I feel like any of those two would exhaust my spirit extremely, so I want to limit our association to this village only. I already have enough trick star girls over here.</p><br/><p>And there is also the issue of my magic power enlargement, I am having a hard time looking for a partner to do a pact with. The previous two are quite tough, so there are no companions who I can lightheartedly say that\u2019s the one.</p><br/><p>I could also contract anyone just for the sake of confirming the hypothesis of Tomoe though.</p><br/><p>Well, if it\u2019s just about migrating, the pact talk has nothing to do with these two.</p><br/><p>They told me they are the forest\u2019s managers, in short, it means that they are a forestry race. In terms of race, they are useful but\u2026 I am not sure yet.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Akua-san and Eris-san right? Thank you for showing me the way, its fine to go now\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>It\u2019s scary how Mio just said it because she felt like it.</p><br/><p>Anyways, after looking at my memories, it ended up in her saying \u201cI want to go to Waka-sama\u2019s country\u201d. Isn\u2019t it more normal to call it another world? Or maybe it\u2019s because there wasn\u2019t enough immersion? She didn\u2019t see all of my memories like Tomoe, so maybe she didn\u2019t arrive to the point of calling it a world transportation.</p><br/><p>Even guns appear in the thing that Mio likes. I thought I had understood this world, but there shouldn\u2019t be a concept of guns in it. </p><br/><p>It\u2019s something obvious, but in this world there is no such invention as guns. Well, there is a chance that a weapon which uses magic similarly to appear though. That\u2019s how deep magic runs in this world. Moreover, most of the people are able to use magic power, so the blessing of magic can be done by anyone.</p><br/><p>There is no soil born weapon that does not pass through magic power at all.</p><br/><p>The usage of it is also low after all.</p><br/><p>Using games as an example, in this world the weak attacks won\u2019t even do 1 damage. No matter what weak attack you do, an attack of 1 damage will not appear. Moreover, there is no critical hit that would ignore defense.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that once you reach a certain amount of defense power, the magic attacks that don\u2019t work on you will technically be nullified. The weapons possess their own magic power, but the bullets that are separated from this principle also fall in this example.</p><br/><p>The bow and arrows that are in your hands for a short period of time are inferior to swords and lances, but there seems to be magic imbued in them as well.</p><br/><p>Even if you throw an iron ball on a low ranked dragon, it wouldn\u2019t hurt it at all. But a level 150 that is specialized in close combat, if he were to attack, even with a sword made of iron the scales would tear. By law, the attack power of an iron ball should be higher.</p><br/><p>Obviously, for a metal that is not suited for magic power flow will have its attack power limited, so to attack a superior dragon with an iron weapon would be pushing it. It\u2019s an example, just an example.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why, guns would only become weapons to kill weak opponents.</p><br/><p>Well, there\u2019s not even the concept of it. The two other heroes should not be idiots, so they would not talk about the concept of guns. It would only make the chances of a massacre occurring in war a lot higher after all.</p><br/><p>In this world, it wouldn\u2019t reach the point of gunpowder and disappear without even developing. The things that gunpowder can do, can mostly be done by magic as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, we want to hear the future plans of our guest\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKeep us company\u201d</p><br/><p>How irritating. Hah~, I feel like getting angry.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnfortunately, Waka-sama and I are busy-desu. I want you to retire-desu\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Mio, nice. I can only smell nuisance from this.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe only want to present you our teacher though\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you accompany us as compensation of breaking our weapons?\u201d</p><br/><p>Their teacher huh\u2026 Yeah, I definitely don\u2019t want to meet him/her. If it\u2019s a character related to them, my stomach wouldn\u2019t hold. A person that doesn\u2019t listen to others\u2019 talks, an active and offensive type of crazy. My will to meet him/her is as low as if I were to meet Mio before the pact.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am sorry, but I am tired after having to fight with you guys, you see. We already took a meal as well, we want to rest. Elder-san also lend us a room for that reason after all\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u2018As an apology for those two\u2019s rudeness, we are preparing a banquet, so please rest\u2019, is what they told me and lend me a room. Or more like, they pushed it onto me.</p><br/><p>Do they have something to ask me at the time of the banquet? I don\u2019t know what sort of banquet they will be doing, but since we are also able to participate, it could be a festival of sorts.</p><br/><p>We came at a good time. Lucky.</p><br/><p>\u201cTired? You? Don\u2019t make me laugh\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s child\u2019s play so come come\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected, these two are hard to handle. I don\u2019t want to keep them company. But this exchange, there is a person who has a boiling point lower than mine so, what should I do? It would hurt for mumbling Mio to come out again. I have already received treatment, but I don\u2019t want to shed blood again.</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me\u201d</p><br/><p>While I was groping for a method to refuse the forceful invitation of the forest ogres that were at the room\u2019s entrance, I heard the voice of a new person.</p><br/><p>A clear and yet calming low tone sound. Sexy guys should die.</p><br/><p>When I search for the owner of that voice, behind AB, there was a young man with an abnormally white skin. The forest ogres\u2019 elders were also young looking, so I don\u2019t know if he is really a young man though.</p><br/><p>Aside from his skin color, his other body characteristics were the same as the other people in the village, but\u2026 what is it? There is something that bothers me. There is a discomfort in me. Is he using a magic of some sort?</p><br/><p>Above all, I didn\u2019t like that he appeared while erasing his presence.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd you are?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I take the initiative to ask the man who walked through the way that AB opened. The position of him may be even higher than those two, there was no complain from them. However, the presence of him wasn\u2019t that gentle. Close to animosity, it could be called disregard.</p><br/><p>\u201cI apologize for the constant discourtesy. My name is Adonou. A relative of one of the elders, saying it bluntly, I am a son. *In terms of workplace, I am one who is in the middle of returning from his workplace\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for your kind introduction. My name is Raidou. This is my companion, Mio. It is very kind for the relative of an elder to come all the way here so late. I am sorry for the rudeness but, Adonou-sama doesn\u2019t feel well somewhere? If it is fine with you, I can provide you a medication that can serve as nourishment\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Courteous and kind. But behaving as a merchant. As long as I don\u2019t know the objective of the other side, instead of being a member of Asora, I thought it would be better to act as a merchant that coincidentally arrived at the village. I am getting tired of having them come one after the other though.</p><br/><p>My act can be hidden by my young age and the lack of experience. Even with a mask hiding my face, I still look young after all. If I take off my mask, I will have to put the mask of a merchant. I will most likely be looked down upon.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Ah, you must be referring to the color of my skin. I had this color since birth, so the state of my body is perfect. I see, a merchant huh. That is what my father said as well. I heard that you were skilled, so I totally thought that you were an adventurer when I spoke to you, hahaha\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am also registered as an adventurer, but that is just for appearance\u2019s sake. I am a rookie merchant. I have also recently opened my company. It\u2019s called Kuzunoha Company. Glad to meet you\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we talk about a human being town that has a merchant guild, it can\u2019t be the base. *Are you staying in Tsige*?\u201d </p><br/><p>What is up with this guy? In regards to that, I should have already told everything at the round table assembly. How troublesome.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right. I came from Tsige\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Could he be searching for lies with magic? I still don\u2019t know the identity of this rough feeling, and I don\u2019t like the fake-looking smile he has. I may also be making a fake-looking face though.</p><br/><p>Damn it, with just Mio staying silent I am having a bad feeling, and yet\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI see I see. It seems that it was only a needless anxiety of mine. Excuse me, by evening the banquet\u2019s preparations will be done. I have some business to attend to, so I will not be able to participate, but please do enjoy it\u201d</p><br/><p>After the man Adonou bowed lightly, he put on his shoes and walked into the corridor. There was no sound of footsteps.</p><br/><p>\u201cAdonou-dono, in the past he wasn\u2019t that eerie\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAdonou is weird\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUhm, can\u2019t you disappear now? We have things to do\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Mio seems to be annoyed, she send sharp words to the Akua-Eris combi. If these guys are here, we are unable to go to Asora, so my feelings are the same.</p><br/><p>I want to be alone for a while though.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected, we will have you meet *shishou*\u201d </p><br/><p>\u201cIts fine, it will only hurt the first time\u201d</p><br/><p>These fellows, do they not know how to read others\u2019 feelings? Seriously, they should\u2026</p><br/><p>*Baki\u2014i!</p><br/><p>\u201c!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Leaving Mio on watch of AB, I react to the sound behind me.</p><br/><p>The sound of destruction.</p><br/><p>Or more like, the wooden walls of the room have been destroyed. There were no windows so it serves as ventilation, wait, that\u2019s not it.</p><br/><p>Was it bad to not use [Sakai] because they were so troublesome? I didn\u2019t notice it.</p><br/><p>\u201cYo! Are you guys the guests?!\u201d</p><br/><p>One \u2018demonic person that doesn\u2019t hear others\u2019 talks, an active and offensive type of crazy\u2019 has appeared.</p><br/><p>The teacher and students are a group of useless kids huh.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know how, but I am sure of it. This one is their Shishou.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that you treated Akua and Eris as kids? That\u2019s quite impressive, hey, the Nii-chan over there, handshake! Let\u2019s do a handshake!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShishou!\u201d</p><br/><p>See? The two\u2019s reaction is on point. However, when he said handshake, the two\u2019s tension appeared. Don\u2019t tell me he has incredible grip power?! Will I go \u2018ouch ouch ouch\u2019?!</p><br/><p>Well, if it\u2019s just a handshake, I can tolerate it.</p><br/><p>Now that I have met him, this type of perverted person won\u2019t back down. Let\u2019s just finish this quickly and have them leave.</p><br/><p>Because, you know, destroying a room\u2019s wall in order to barge in and say \u2018Yo\u2019, that\u2019s just no good. I am sure that Mio will end up showing her rape face again.</p><br/><p>*Mugi </p><br/><p>Uh, eh? I am not going \u2018ouch ouch ouch\u2019.</p><br/><p>*Mugi~ mugyu</p><br/><p>*Moshimoshi*, this is gross old man. </p><br/><p>I have my hand gripped by a man with a scary serious face and swept back hair.</p><br/><p>\u2026 Ah! Don\u2019t tell me, does he swing THAT way?! No good, I demand evasive maneuvers! This is a situation that surpasses intellectual inquisitiveness!</p><br/><p>\u201cHoh~?\u201d</p><br/><p>*Zowa</p><br/><p>C-Chills are\u2026!</p><br/><p>\u201cWah, can you please release my hand?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I was already not putting any strength from my side. Because of the fear, my strength is draining.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is quite\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>*Zowazowa</p><br/><p>AB and Mio gulped. An extremely strange air was beginning to permeate our surroundings.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time, how nice\u201d</p><br/><p>*Zowazowazowa!</p><br/><p>*Buchi!</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you to let go, eh, buchi?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cDivine punishment!!!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>I was already reaching the limits of my patience. The moment I was about to do a karate chop on the guy that was doing a handshake\u2026</p><br/><p>I seem to have heard the sound of a vein popping and a gale began to dance in the surroundings, the pervert\u2019s figure dissapeared.</p><br/><p>Oh?</p><br/><p>At my left side I could see an agitated Mio, her shoulders going up and down from her breathing.</p><br/><p>So she was the one that said divine punishment huh. She is holding her folding fan in one hand.</p><br/><p>Ah! So she blew away the pervert with that! That I can\u2019t see his figure is because he must have exited the room from the wall he himself destroyed. Flying.</p><br/><p>Is he alive? No, he is alive. Those kind of types won\u2019t easily go down.</p><br/><p>\u201cShi-Shishou~!\u201d</p><br/><p>AB analyzed the situation slower than me, letting out their voices once more, they left on the same wall and followed the traces of their Shishou.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cI?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cNot even I have been so close to Waka-sama like that and yet! That scoundrel! 32 seconds with Waka-sama!\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Scary!!</p><br/><p>You are also scary enough!</p><br/><p>A suspicious muscular homo and a hungry and vigorous yandere huh.</p><br/><p>What dreadful choices. If this were an *eroge* and it were the hot topic in society, I still have confidence I would not put a hand on it. </p><br/><p>For now, I didn\u2019t want to think about anything.</p><br/><p>I will go sleep obediently until the banquet. To recover my sanity, sleep is necessary. I don\u2019t have confidence in having a sound sleep though.</p><br/><p>~ ??? ~</p><br/><p>What a hard to understand existence have I encountered.</p><br/><p>He is suspicious of me. I\u2019m probably not wrong.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s been a while since I entered this rare race, but it\u2019s the first time I have seen such an existence.</p><br/><p>Neither of them are mere hyumans.</p><br/><p>If they are the existences I have been looking for\u2026 Well, I don\u2019t think such a thing is possible though.</p><br/><p>Then, without minding anyone, I will move. To reach my long-cherished desire is my utmost priority.</p><br/><p>The possibility of this interesting power to not work has appeared. So I have to take care of them with my real body huh.</p><br/><p>What should I do about communication?</p><br/><p>It wouldn\u2019t be fun if there\u2019s a hindrance. It\u2019s decided.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right.</p><br/><p>\u2026 There\u2019s no need. That woman was originally just in an equivalent cooperation with me. No, it could be said that I was using her.</p><br/><p>No matter what the truth is, I have taken an interest in those fellows. I want them as experiment material.</p><br/><p>I have already understood the ability of the forest ogres, so there is no need for me to stay here anymore. In the end, it was something I didn\u2019t need.</p><br/><p>After so long, I might have arrived at an existence that might give me a clue of \u2018that\u2019.</p><br/><p>At the banquet.</p><br/><p>I will receive it without delay.</p><br/><p>The masked boy and the black woman.</p><br/><p>That you have met me was your misfortune.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

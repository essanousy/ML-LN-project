At the entrance, there was Tomoe and Shiki.</p><br/><p>Maybe because of the after-effects of depleting a high amount of magic power, my head was a bit heavy.</p><br/><p>When I was pulling my bow, I felt refreshed, but when I finished, that sluggish sensation returned.</p><br/><p>While I was greeting the two, my head went round and round and there was no change.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood morning, Waka. It looks like your complexion is still not that good but\u2026could it be that for Waka, pulling the bow works as a medicine?\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cGood morning, Waka-sama.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cInstead of calling it medicine, it is more like a part of me. I was told that it was okay to not hold back after all.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I look at the bow in my hands and a wry smile appears in both of their faces.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe classes are tomorrow, is what I have heard but, are you heading somewhere today?\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026No, I still haven\u2019t decided yet. I have something to take care of in Rotsgard, so I was thinking about showing my face in the store, but\u2026I think that\u2019s all I have in my plans.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThen can you accompany me for a bit? There seems to be a small change in Asora you see.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026In that case, I will change quickly. Mio is already there?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I ask Tomoe as we walk the corridor.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, she has unexpectedly woken up early you see. She said that she will be checking the bowl and has gone to the Eldwas\u2019 furnace.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cBowl\u2026ah, the cooking one. Ceramics have already been completely incorporated in Asora huh. I thought it would end up as a hobby for only a part of them, that\u2019s unexpected.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I had the Eldwas make a furnace and have them practice ceramic.</p><br/><p>Of course, it was the proposal of Tomoe.</p><br/><p>It is quite a while back, but the pottery that was created from the ceramic was liked by the people of Asora.</p><br/><p>Interestingly, the Highland Orcs, Mist Lizards, Arkes, Gorgons, and the Winged-kins; in all the races, there were people that showed interest in it.</p><br/><p>In Asora where metallic and wooden tools prevailed even in tableware, lately, it has been ceramics in all.</p><br/><p>It has become natural to make the tablewares that one will be using on their own.</p><br/><p>I returned to my room and finished changing, and once again follow the two.</p><br/><p>Breakfast will be for later.</p><br/><p>If something has happened in Asora, I have to know swiftly.</p><br/><p>\u201cCeramics serve as greetings from the Company, in negotiations, and even for souvenirs. It is truly convenient. Seeing that there\u2019s currently no products similar to others, it seems like everyone is adhering to reproducing it by magic. It is a grateful thing for us that it is showing worth, but, although it is true that they are not teaching the manufacturing methods, they are not trying to hide it at all. How idiotic.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>When we grouped up again, the conversation was still about ceramic.</p><br/><p>Shiki was prioritizing the \u2018worth\u2019 of ceramic.</p><br/><p>Maybe that\u2019s why he has begun giving them away in negotiations and important customers as gifts.</p><br/><p>Lately, this has also been known around as a defining product of the Kuzunoha Company.</p><br/><p>\u2026There\u2019s also talk that it is being sold at high prices in the black market.</p><br/><p>I think that it won\u2019t be long for Limia and Gritonia to begin making them as well though.</p><br/><p>Also, Lorel has the knowledge of our world as well, moreover, there\u2019s already people putting it into practice, so there should be no reason to be getting this much attention.</p><br/><p>Yeah.</p><br/><p>Just like how Shiki said, we are not making obvious the manufacturing method, but we are not hiding it either.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why I thought it was strange that it hasn\u2019t been copied till now.</p><br/><p>Even in the store, the Eldwas, Forest Ogres, and Shiki himself were distributing the bowls they made to the customers.</p><br/><p>It is limited to a number of important customers is what I told them, and the others, I left it to their own discretion.</p><br/><p>By the way, in terms of how well they are made, I think that the ones the Eldwas make are number one, but for some reason, the ones that Akua, Eris and Shiki worked on, have more popularity.</p><br/><p>Maybe that\u2019s why the Eldwas had their competitive spirit lit on and increased their own skills, and it seems a portion of the dilettantes assessed them highly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, in given time, it will circulate to the Empire and the Kingdom, won\u2019t it? There\u2019s the hero there and all.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. Well, it is already pretty well-known that it is our style anyways. It won\u2019t really bother us.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. Then Tomoe, what was that about a change?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, according to the Winged-kin\u2026it seems like at the northeast, a giant lake can be seen.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cLake?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Does that mean the terrain has increased?</p><br/><p>But I don\u2019t have more followers.</p><br/><p>It is way too short of a time for a lake to have formed naturally, but if it is Asora\u2026it might be possible?</p><br/><p>Ah, they did say it was giant, so even in Asora, that wouldn\u2019t happen.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, they said that it was the first time they have seen a size like this, and that they can\u2019t see the end of it. Everything is water, and that new scent was carried by the wind, they said. We won\u2019t know until we actually see it ourselves though.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cSo big you can\u2019t see the end of it, and a new scent? Could that possible be\u2026\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I also thought of the probability. And so, I was bringing Shiki to check it out and met with Waka.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cLately, I have been going with Mio-dono to the port city when there\u2019s time, so I am already used to seeing the sea.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>Shiki speaks about a port city.</p><br/><p>As expected, the two thought the same as I.</p><br/><p>\u201cSea huh.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can be taken that way. And in reality, when I asked the Winged-kin if it was the sea, they asked me what was that.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut if it\u2019s the sea, Waka-sama hasn\u2019t gotten a new follower, and I don\u2019t think Asora has expanded for no reason. It might be some sort of sign.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s true.</p><br/><p>Until now, Asora has been increasing its size depending on my increase in magic power.</p><br/><p>But it hasn\u2019t made any big changes in topography.</p><br/><p>Those kind of cases occur when a new follower like Mio and Tomoe get added to the team.</p><br/><p>The biggest change lately would be\u2026the addition of Sari.</p><br/><p>She is the first demon element here, but she doesn\u2019t have much power, so I don\u2019t think this place would change much just because she was added.</p><br/><p>Demi-humans, Mamonos, and hyumans who have more power than her have entered, and it hasn\u2019t shown much change, so the chances are low.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways, I want to confirm it quick. Tomoe, you know where it is, right?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. Just in case, I have told everyone not to get close to it.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, let\u2019s go. Can we teleport there?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Tomoe quickly creates a Mist Gate.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t think it will be dangerous, but it is the first time something like this has occurred.</p><br/><p>With a bit of cautiousness, I enter the mist, and then\u2026</p><br/><p>A pure white sandy beach, and waves of water, water, water\u2026a whole space of water and the horizon that can be seen afar.</p><br/><p>A splendid beach like the ones that can be seen in the southern touring catalogues.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I was speechless.</p><br/><p>This is the sea.</p><br/><p>It is a type that I have not seen in real life, but I was sure that it was the sea.</p><br/><p>I have actual proof that poisons practically don\u2019t work on me, so without much cautiousness, I went to the beach and gave a lick to the water.</p><br/><p>Yeah, it is salty.</p><br/><p>Salt water.</p><br/><p>Tomoe and Shiki did the same and nod.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is definitely the sea.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is the sea, it is strangely peaceful though.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo doubt about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shiki, who has done a variety of tasks in the port city, seems to be excited.</p><br/><p>I use [Sakai] to search for our current location and the end of the sea.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s a number of islands, and there\u2019s also a wall of mist quite far.</p><br/><p>Just that it is not visible from here, so it must be really far.</p><br/><p>From the Mirage Town to here\u2026I wonder, maybe with a carriage it will take quite a bit to get here.</p><br/><p>It might take one to two hours if they hurry, but it would be necessary to have transportation.</p><br/><p>Ah, I spontaneously thought of the carriage with luggage accounted as well.</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s just people in it, it should be a bit faster.</p><br/><p>Especially the Winged-kin, I think they would arrive here pretty fast.</p><br/><p>But to make it realistically possible to come and go regularly, there would be a need for a method to teleport huh.</p><br/><p>Specially in Asora where there\u2019s no enemy, there\u2019s not much worry about setting a teleport formation.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that I think about it, at our back\u2026?!\u201d</p><br/><p>I am at the very center of the sandy beach. Maybe because of my surprise in the sea, I didn\u2019t check out the scale of the beach.</p><br/><p>Thinking about that, I look at my back.</p><br/><p>There, the sandy beach continued for a while, and then, it turns into land.</p><br/><p>This is something that I somewhat understood with Sakai though. But looking at it with my own eyes makes my body stiffen.</p><br/><p>At the other side of the white sand that continues on for a while, there\u2019s dry land.</p><br/><p>In the land, there\u2019s sparse amounts of grass growing, and trees here and there.</p><br/><p>It could be said that at the other side of the super high quality beach, it was a bit dry.</p><br/><p>But that\u2019s not the part I was surprised about.</p><br/><p>It was the fact that there was something there that Sakai didn\u2019t detect at all.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s one of the reasons.</p><br/><p>The other reason, are the trees.</p><br/><p>A tree I have only seen once in TV, but has an unforgettable form.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, it seems like there\u2019s something there. A sign? In Asora?\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>It seems like Tomoe has also noticed it.</p><br/><p>It is not surprising that she hasn\u2019t given attention to the trees.</p><br/><p>I approach the sign that Tomoe pointed out and my Sakai didn\u2019t react to.</p><br/><p>I activate my Magic Armor, and use Sakai in enhancement as I approach.</p><br/><p>I was quite on guard.</p><br/><p>Approaching it, and arriving at the sign from a distance where I can read its contents\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Hah?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I unconsciously let out a stupefied voice.</p><br/><p>Tomoe and Shiki also run to where I was.</p><br/><p>Each time they kick the sand, it makes a *kyukyu* sound and it makes it less dramatic.</p><br/><p>When I finish reading it till the end, the sign shines brightly and flew up.</p><br/><p>Yeah, like a touch and go.</p><br/><p>\u2026Hah\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018You have really increased your magic power, Makoto. This is a gift from me. I had my brother help a bit, but it is frankly, the sea! By the way, this is a relay gift, and the gift from Daikoku-jisan will be coming a bit later. Do your best from now on as well. Also, after you finish reading this sign, it will become fireworks. There\u2019s no reason for it.</p><br/><p>-By Susanoo.\u201d</p><br/><p>And so, that\u2019s what was written.</p><br/><p>And here I was wondering what was going on.</p><br/><p>Now that he mentions it, when those Gods came, they did say something about gifts.</p><br/><p>\u2026It seems that because of Daikokuten-sama\u2019s gift, I ended up seeing those weird dreams, so at this rate, I feel like I will be played around for 1 more round.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know what it will be, but I think that once I increase my magic power more and make Asora bigger, I will know.</p><br/><p>Sea.</p><br/><p>The sea huh.</p><br/><p>What an incredible surprise.</p><br/><p>It seems like there are rich people that get things like islands and castles, but receiving a sea is kinda\u2026rare, I think.</p><br/><p>A *Don* sound that let us know of the firework resounded in the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cWaka, what\u2019s going on?\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you hurt anywhere?\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cI am fine. It is from a God, he says that he will be giving me a sea.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like in this matter of the sea, we are free to use it in whichever way we like.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cSo a sea is something that can be given.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if it\u2019s Asora, that\u2019s way too absurd.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>Shiki\u2019s voice was a bit cracked.</p><br/><p>I feel like the words of Shiki about being absurd include me as well.</p><br/><p>Please spare me from that.</p><br/><p>I also understand how you feel.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe sign didn\u2019t mention it, but with that tree here, I wonder if Athena-sama was involved in this as well.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cTree? The tree that is here and there? It is certainly true that it has an interesting shape. As I thought, it really is something from your world, Waka?\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. This is my first time seeing this personally though. It has that form, after all. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a way I would mistake it.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it a tree that\u2019s related to a God? In other words, a type of sacred tree? Now that you mention it, I have heard from Tomoe-dono that there are Shrines in your world that are made in places with these kind of sacred trees.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>Shiki makes a wrong guess about my words and is deeply misunderstanding.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, sacred trees are mostly trees that have history in it and are seen to have long longevity-ja ga.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Tomoe seems to have begun holding a dispute with Shiki.</p><br/><p>Well, there\u2019s no need to do something like that. Tomoe\u2019s explanation is correct after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cShiki, I didn\u2019t say it with that meaning. I brought out the name of that God because that tree originally grows in places close to where people who hold believe towards that God are.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I think that this was part of a homework I had.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom its shape, it looks like a mushroom.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>Right.</p><br/><p>It has a look like that of a mushroom or a broccoli.</p><br/><p>From a set distance of the trunk, a large amount of branches spread, and at the top side of it, it is filled in green.</p><br/><p>The trunk stretching straight up makes it look like a mushroom, but midway, it ramifies and that makes it look like broccoli.</p><br/><p>Its name has impact, and after looking at its strange look from videos, I was able to clearly remember it.</p><br/><p>I really wanted to one day see it for myself, but to think that it would be fulfilled in this way.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is called the Socotra Dragon Tree, and it is written as Dragon Blood Tree.\u201d (Makoto) </p><br/><p>dragon-blood</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Quite the dangerous name it has.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Tomoe had a slightly bitter face.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn my world, dragons didn\u2019t exist, so I think dragons had no real relation to it. If I remember correctly, the sap that comes out from the trunk is deep red, and it serves as medicine. And they called it dragon blood or something like that, so it moved by word of mouth and was called the Dragon Blood Tree\u2026or so I think\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>There\u2019s Gods, so maybe Dragons actually did exist, but well, in my common sense, they didn\u2019t, so\u2026</p><br/><p>If a dragon was actually involved in that tree, it would be interesting, but that\u2019s of no importance right now.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no way to confirm it after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cA red sap that can be used as medicine. That\u2019s interesting.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>Shiki looks at the Dragon Blood Tree with different eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, it is not only used as ointment, it seems like it has a trait of hardening in rain, so it seems like it was used as a pill as well.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Do you mind if I investigate it?\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. It\u2019s related with the flora, so call the Arkes and Forest Onis as well, okay?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cWaka, in my part, I want to investigate the sea itself. Do you mind if I use Mio for that?\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Just that, Mio and I aren\u2019t specialized in the sea, so if possible, it would be a great help if we had someone that knew of the sea and what\u2019s in it.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cTrue. Is there someone like that?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cNone. How about it, Waka? Asora has increased in size quite a bit, so how about doing a resident selection again?\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cNew residents huh. Looking at the Gorgons and the Winged-kin, if it\u2019s the people that you guys select, it won\u2019t be a problem, maybe.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, I will have Waka do a final interview.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Uh, she got me.</p><br/><p>Even though I haven\u2019t proposed anything, she already got me.</p><br/><p>Hm?</p><br/><p>Ah!</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, I will do that, but hey Tomoe, weren\u2019t there people that weren\u2019t able to pass in the end? The small ones.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cSmall\u2026ah, there were. I heard they made Ema angry. I don\u2019t remember if they were fairies or spirits or whatever\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, those guys\u2026eh? What was their name?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Ah\u2026ehm\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAntonio?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I remember correctly, they did have that kind of name. It was A-something.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened to them? We want people related to water right now but, can you investigate that just in case?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Waka-sama, Tomoe-dono; they are called Al-Efemera. A peculiar fairy race that controls a part of the Spirits.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>Shiki entered the conversation that was proceeding between Tomoe and I.</p><br/><p>Oh, right.</p><br/><p>They did have that kind of name!</p><br/><p>The only thing I could remember was how feisty they were.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Al-Efemera huh. I could only remember that they were a spunky bunch.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>So Tomoe was almost the same huh.</p><br/><p>Who was the one that was responsible for them?</p><br/><p>As I thought, I can\u2019t remember the details.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks, Shiki. Al-Efemera, right. Then Tomoe, begin the selection, okay?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026No well, there\u2019s already a flood of people wishing for migration, you know? Even if I call it selection, it is more like, finally opening one door for a massive line. Well, it is something like that, so it won\u2019t take that much time. What we will be doing is having a few interviews, and investigate the particulars of that race, so\u2026it won\u2019t be long before Waka interviews them.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026A flood, I see. Well, I count on you for the investigation of the numbers in the race and its scale.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Tomoe and Shiki had begun doing thought transmission.</p><br/><p>As for me, I was looking at the sea.</p><br/><p>The more I looked at it, the more this beach instilled my desire to take off my clothes and jump into it.</p><br/><p>I feel like I can expect quite a bit when the starry sky and the moon come out.</p><br/><p>With this scale, there shouldn\u2019t be any complains in having it as a private beach for a bit of time, right?</p><br/><p>My expectations are growing.</p><br/><p>Anyways, new residents, and a subject that Shiki is interested in researching huh.</p><br/><p>Counting the business in the demon race territory, there are a lot of things to do now.</p><br/><p>When I go to Rotsgard, there will probably be talk about me going to Lorel, so the other party will most likely want it to happen soon.</p><br/><p>It is known that I went to the Empire, so even if I don\u2019t refuse them, I wonder when I will actually be able to go.</p><br/><p>Mio and Senpai didn\u2019t have a good atmosphere between them, so if possible, I should leave Mio. I want to go in a time when Senpai is not there and return though.</p><br/><p>Regarding this, I should confirm the plans.</p><br/><p>Thinking of resting today and working tomorrow might have been a bit of wishful thinking from me.</p><br/><p>Looking at the waves that were peacefully overlapping in the sea, matters appear one after another, and yet, I make a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>Yeah, let\u2019s begin moving starting today.</p><br/><p>The only business I had in Rotsgard was to look at the weakened Root that Tomoe told me about, but that idiot, he literally used all his strength in that blaze, and because of the recoil, he is bedridden, or so I heard.</p><br/><p>He is really an idiot to the core.</p><br/><p>About visiting Root\u2026I will do some extra tasks while I\u2019m there.</p><br/><p>And so, from today on, I will be working.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Come ahead and try.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Like hell I would say that! There is nothing in this world more unbelievable than me!!</p><br/><p>This is a set thing, no, a reality would not be an exaggeration!</p><br/><p>In panic I jump behind it.</p><br/><p>The dragon, without minding that its bite had missed it began to draw near me again. Another biting attack!</p><br/><p>A snake flying in midair, now that I think about it it\u2019s really hard to predict its movements?!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d (Shen)</p><br/><p>Turning my body I jump to the sides.</p><br/><p>Safe! I am still alive.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t let the dragon out of my sight. By seeing the size of the giant mouth that can easily crunch me down, I am able to somehow determine the size of its head.</p><br/><p>I try to figure out how is its whole body.</p><br/><p>What, so it\u2019s like many times bigger than a bullet train huh. I am not sure of its length though.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>I\u2019m going to die!!</p><br/><p>What a stupid turn of events, supervisor!! Hey bug, come out bug!!</p><br/><p>You should certainly have a legendary weapon or a legendary tool lying over there right?!</p><br/><p>The mist has finally come all the way down here.</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t clearly see my surroundings nor my own hands.</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t even see where I am standing.</p><br/><p>There is such a big dragon so close to me, yet I can\u2019t even see its figure.</p><br/><p>Moreover, if the dragon moves, the mist should also undulate with it. But the mist stays calm, just staying in place.</p><br/><p>The one creating that mist is certainly, that dragon Shen huh. No fair.</p><br/><p>To top it off, its presence.</p><br/><p>To not even be able to feel that is just too weird. This mist is not a normal mist after all.</p><br/><p>Disadvantageous, this is an incredibly disadvantageous situation.</p><br/><p>Chills run down the nape of my neck.</p><br/><p>I run at that moment and then turn my head to look behind.</p><br/><p>A giant mouth was there.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it fair that I can\u2019t feel its presence this much?!\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t have space to return blows.</p><br/><p>When you are fighting an opponent with a giant body, the first thing one must think is the opening in its attacks and the time to get a blow in. It\u2019s established that you must evade and defend every single blow that opponent does. Probably.</p><br/><p>Anyways, the conclusion I have reached from all my action games and fighting games is that in this moments I should just calm down. In this kind of situation I can\u2019t defend carelessly.</p><br/><p>But I can\u2019t see its body and it\u2019s able to suddenly appear behind me and chomp. In that case I can\u2019t even counter! What a shitty game method!</p><br/><p>Like fighting a last boss in a new fighting game you got.</p><br/><p>And moreover after that body like a snake, comes the head.</p><br/><p>If I evade its attack that head would come right in front of me to chomp me. That\u2019s why I can\u2019t take that moment to get one hit to its body. And I don\u2019t even know if there are claws in there as well.</p><br/><p>What should I do?! What should I do?!</p><br/><p>3 blue cards began to float inside of my head. Well, aren\u2019t we pretty composed myself? Lets see.</p><br/><p>You should just evade it with spirit and then get a hit in!</p><br/><p>Then just clear away the mist, now go ahead and blow some wind!</p><br/><p>The one who hits first wins! Attack randomly!</p><br/><p>The first one seems impossible. My six sense is telling me that I can\u2019t attack in that situation.</p><br/><p>Second one. Call Zhuge Liang.</p><br/><p>Third one. Lowering my attack strength and relying on speed to hit all over the place. Anyways I could throw fire balls all over the place and locate the enemy\u2019s location. And in the location I confirm, I will shoot a fire arrow.</p><br/><p>Yes, that\u2019s it. The third one looks doable.</p><br/><p>More like, with my head, that is the limit.</p><br/><p>I just have to do it. In this close to zero distance, I don\u2019t think I will be able to last long. If I fall into panic I will be hunt down.</p><br/><p>~Shen POV~</p><br/><p>Enveloping him in the mist, I will make my opponent conscious of my attacks and then drag him into \u2018Asora\u2019 and kill him.</p><br/><p>I am, in the dragons\u2019 ranks, one of the most superior ones. I am called \u2018invincible\u2019</p><br/><p>But the reason of being invincible is because of my power \u2018Asora\u2019</p><br/><p>Using my mist as an intermediary, I am able to drag anything that my mist has seized into a world that I have created.</p><br/><p>In that world I am able to limit magic, and I can bend the laws of physic.</p><br/><p>For me to lose at that place is impossible. The me inside Asora is not my real body after all.</p><br/><p>My body is in some way detached so even if I lose there, my real body will not be there anymore.</p><br/><p>The moment I drag him there, I could just withdraw after all. In that situation I can one sidedly attack him.</p><br/><p>In the past there has been no events where I haven\u2019t been able to eliminate my enemy in Asora.</p><br/><p>And I plan to do just that to the fool that destroyed my gate.</p><br/><p>Before the mist arrived I bit two times, the moment it arrived I would just need to use it as an intermediary and take him away to Asora, with that it should be the end.</p><br/><p>Yet.</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t drag him away.</p><br/><p>No matter how many times I try, it felt like forcefully trying to put something big inside a small hole. (TN: hehehehe~)</p><br/><p>Was the door I made too small?</p><br/><p>Then I will just have to hunt him down inside this mist.</p><br/><p>I tried attacking him from behind.</p><br/><p>But he somehow was able to detect me and evade it.</p><br/><p>What an incredibly troublesome hyuman. But with this I can\u2019t just kill him.</p><br/><p>I have to check why I am unable to drag him to Asora.</p><br/><p>How he is able to evade me in this mist that is supposed to wane all senses. Is that just a coincidence?</p><br/><p>If this continues, my invincibility will begin to sway.</p><br/><p>If the one who instigated him to do this is another superior dragon then I have to certainly settle this score.</p><br/><p>I have only been sleeping in this extremity of the world so I don\u2019t know of any negativity I have instilled though.</p><br/><p>If its just because it envies my tittle of invincible then I won\u2019t forgive it. No matter what enemy it is I will bring it down.</p><br/><p>I inspect the state of the hyuman. On my side, I can see him clearly.</p><br/><p>Is that a fire ball? He is throwing them here and there.</p><br/><p>Too bad for him, I have a resistance to elements. At that level I will be able to easily bear it.</p><br/><p>This decision was wrong.</p><br/><p>I began to circle my prey while being cautious of it. Of course I was reading the trajectory of the brids and evading them but.</p><br/><p>One of them got me.</p><br/><p>It hit my body.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t hurt one bit but, the mist surrounding me cleared slightly. My scaled body was now in clear sight.</p><br/><p>It was a speed that could be said only took an instant.</p><br/><p>The hyuman ,concentrating his maryoku,created immediately an abnormally condensed brid. And accurately pointed it at my body.</p><br/><p>I tried to bend my body up to evade it but.</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t make it. In just an instant it came sharply to me as if it was an arrow and \u2018pierced\u2019 my body.</p><br/><p>In my body that is resistant to fire the same brid that I shouldn\u2019t feel the heat from and it was the same hyuman\u2019s brid but.</p><br/><p>It pierced me with an unbelievable speed, and exploded.</p><br/><p>Tremendous heat and pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cAgyaaaaaa!!!!\u201d (Shen)</p><br/><p>Without noticing that the blast had cleared away most of the mist around.</p><br/><p>I, in the first time of my life, had done the thing called scream.</p><br/><p>My body, what has become of my body?!</p><br/><p>Not noticing my own situation, the me at that time hurriedly checked the place that had received the attack.</p><br/><p>The part that had received that atrocious attack had been half burned and gouge out.</p><br/><p>The inside of my heart that had gone blank with amazement was soon filled with rage.</p><br/><p>With bloodshot eyes I search for that hyuman!</p><br/><p>This is not a prey anymore. He is not a prey that I should hunt, he is a sworn enemy I must destroy!</p><br/><p>But at this moment I shouldn\u2019t have grown anxious about my wound.</p><br/><p>I shouldn\u2019t have lost sight of him.</p><br/><p>Searching for him, I had finally found him in my field of vision!</p><br/><p>He was in a close blind spot of mine.</p><br/><p>What is this, what is this, what is this thing!!</p><br/><p>\u201cDesperation Hand Thrust!\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Thrust!</p><br/><p>Saying something I couldn\u2019t understand well, he drives his fist into my cheek.</p><br/><p>Feeling like a hammer had hit me, the insides of my head felt like stars were whirling. This is not the physical strength of a hyuman! Its like an Ogre or a Giant, or maybe even stronger than that?!</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that isn\u2019t enough then! Backhanded Fist!\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Backfist!</p><br/><p>Moreover, he attacks me in the same place!!</p><br/><p>It was not in the same proportion as the last one!</p><br/><p>It\u2019s an outrageous power. Not only my face, all of my body is sent in the opposite direction.</p><br/><p>But a reward has come after all the damage!</p><br/><p>With this I will be able to once again slip into my mist.</p><br/><p>I correct myself. This hyuman is dangerous, he is clearly not normal. There is no doubt that he is under the divine protection of someone.</p><br/><p>As expected its one of the superior dragons? He is a hyuman, this kind of strengthening is just unbelievable.</p><br/><p>Then that means\u2026 a god?!</p><br/><p>That ever changing Goddess?!</p><br/><p>If its that then it wouldn\u2019t be that impossible. But this hyuman has the appearance of a normal person.</p><br/><p>He doesn\u2019t look like a person who would be able to gain the affection of that Goddess.</p><br/><p>Then who in the world. I will not back down from the pain, this is my first time getting hit in the face. The burned part in my body still hurts.</p><br/><p>Just what!</p><br/><p>?!?!?!?!?!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is the place I am in\u2026?\u201d (Shen)</p><br/><p>Now, in my right side. He was\u2026 he was there.</p><br/><p>No way. No matter what, inside the mist it should be impossible. It\u2019s true that it has become thinner but for him to be able to\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that it has come to this I will use my certain kill skill\u2026\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>His hand began to grow red. He said a really dangerous word. W-What is he\u2026 trying to do?</p><br/><p>\u201cFrog Jump UPPER!!\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Shoryuken!</p><br/><p>Shoryuken!</p><br/><p>He drives his fist onto my chin.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecome a STAAAARR!!!\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Half of my body was sent flying by his fist. And just like that my body crumbled in the opposite direction.</p><br/><p>In my consciousness that I could barely sustain.</p><br/><p>Even if I hadn\u2019t perished yet, this was an overwhelmingly dangerous dilemma.</p><br/><p>What a humiliation.</p><br/><p>I will not care about the methods I utilize. I understand this well.</p><br/><p>In my collapsed state, I pretend that I have lost consciousness and begin to search for his location inside the mist.</p><br/><p>I silently breathe a mist that is used for mirages.</p><br/><p>Even without Asora, my powers are not that simple.</p><br/><p>My true nature is mirage. I can peek into the memories of my target, after that I am able to reproduce illusions that my enemy wants or doesn\u2019t want.</p><br/><p>If I make a barrier of deep mist and pour in my power I can make the illusion even more real to the point that it\u2019s no different from reality.</p><br/><p>For some reason I can\u2019t drag this guy to Asora.</p><br/><p>Then taking this sudden situation into account I will just trap him inside this mist and \u2018keep him\u2019 until he dies.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s no good if it\u2019s an illusion he doesn\u2019t want. There might be problems if he struggles.</p><br/><p>Showing him an illusion he wants, inside that happiness he will die of starvation. Hyuman, no matter how strengthened you are, with 10 days you should definitely die.</p><br/><p>If 10 days is not enough 1 month, I can even go on for 1 year.</p><br/><p>With my new resolution I search for the hyuman.</p><br/><p>To think I would have to play dead and that I had to choose a way of killing that was like trying to curry favor.</p><br/><p>With his back straightened, the man breathes.</p><br/><p>But this is just him pretending. The mist around him is telling me that that man has not lowered his guard down. What a through attitude.</p><br/><p>And slowly edging, he checks his surroundings. And without a single bit of negligence, he went \u2018out of the mist\u2019.</p><br/><p>This time surely, his cautiousness will slacken. It\u2019s something normal. There is no doubt that \u2018he went out of the mist\u2019, or so he thinks!</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t chant an aria!</p><br/><p>Now. The place he is in is a scenery of \u2018out of the mist\u2019 that I projected but its still \u2018inside the mist\u2019.</p><br/><p>I can do it!</p><br/><p>I open my eyes! And the hyuman jumps out in a single breath. As expected. To think he can move to that extend.</p><br/><p>But you are too late.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the end\u201d (Shen)</p><br/><p>The end</p><br/><p>With flooding emotions I create a square space wrapped up by a barrier of mist.</p><br/><p>\u2014-</p><br/><p>Images taken from Tsuki ga Michibiku manga that is translated by /AK/ scans</p><br/>\n</div>"}

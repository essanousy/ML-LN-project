I have something to talk to you about.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Hey, Raidou-kun\u2026\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>For now, I don\u2019t intend to follow your will, you know.</p><br/><p>\u201cThinking about the experience of us both, I think bondage play is a bit too fast. Actually, I should be the one leading at first. To tell you the truth, I coincidentally have a blindfold\u2026are you interested?\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>Root who is restrained in midair for now, was cheerfully saying rotten things while blushing.</p><br/><p>Right, he is this kind of guy.</p><br/><p>Yeah, I am beginning to remember now.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot at all! And by the way, this isn\u2019t something to say in the Adventurer Guild!\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?! This place is practically my house, so it is fine, it is fine.\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>He is the Guild Master after all\u2026</p><br/><p>Whatever.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s bring him to the company quickly.</p><br/><p>Ah right, before that, let\u2019s ask Toa-san about Aznoval-san while I am here, and if possible, ask her to investigate about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cUhm, it seems like you are in the middle of something, so I will be excusing myself now, okay?\u201d (Toa)</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease wait. Actually, there\u2019s one thing that I want to ask you.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cRaidou-san, to me? Of course, go ahead and ask anything.\u201d (Toa)</p><br/><p>Toa made a surprised face as she accepted to answer my question.</p><br/><p>Well, she currently has no need to hide anything from me after all; including the matter of her ancestors\u2019 dagger.</p><br/><p>It helps me out.</p><br/><p>Right now there\u2019s other people here that can listen, but\u2026well, even if the name Aznoval is spread from my mouth, it feels like it would have a lot of merits.</p><br/><p>No need to care.</p><br/><p>I will ask Root later, and in the first place, he is acquainted with them, and not only that, he also knows about their immortality.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is about a knight going by the name Aznoval. Do you have some sort of connection with him, or maybe you know someone that is connected with him?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hm?</p><br/><p>Both Toa and Root did quite the reaction.</p><br/><p>It felt as if they had heard an unexpected name.</p><br/><p>But this\u2026it looks like not only Root, even Toa also knows about the name Aznoval.</p><br/><p>Rembrandt-san also knew about it, and it might be possible it is only that.</p><br/><p>No, this way of getting surprised is strange.</p><br/><p>It is different from the time with Rembrandt-san.</p><br/><p>\u201cRaidou-kun, you\u2026brought out quite the name again. Well, in Lorel, it is indeed a name that you would hear though.\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>Root was making a hard to describe face as he brings out his voice as if squeezing it out.</p><br/><p>He is the very person that made them immortal.</p><br/><p>It probably revived some bitter memories and nostalgic memories as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cAznoval\u2026 The standard-bearer of the Adventurers of Origin. Knight Aznoval?\u201d (Toa)</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like you know him.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cMy origins are from there. There\u2019s no person in Lorel who hates the priestess or Apple. Same goes for me.\u201d (Toa)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Ooh.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seems like Root took interest in the nostalgic words of Toa, he voiced it out.</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore the Union came into existence, they were supporting the people without being double-faced about it. Legendary existences that left their mark in history. Is that what you know?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat as well. But for me, Aznoval is actually a bit special. Within the Adventurers of Origin, he is a heroic person that\u2019s described as the representation of muscle and recklessness. And his stories are mostly within those types.\u201d (Toa)</p><br/><p>He is the standard bearer, right?</p><br/><p>In a leader way.</p><br/><p>I am also a top that can\u2019t say much of others, but is that really okay?</p><br/><p>Root is smiling in glee.</p><br/><p>Does that mean that really is the description of this Aznoval person?</p><br/><p>\u201cBut he was by no means a stupid man. In a long past, when Lorel had the objective of raising their national prestige by slaying a certain Superior Dragon that slept in the wasteland, the knight Aznoval suddenly appeared at the center of the country and warned them to stop that.\u201d (Toa)</p><br/><p>Toa-san speaks as if reminiscing a long past.</p><br/><p>Well, it is actually a long past though.</p><br/><p>However, for her, that challenge to this Superior Dragon and the stopping of it has warped her life heavily.</p><br/><p>That certain Superior Dragon, Shen.</p><br/><p>Called invincible, and indulging in sleep\u2026 well, it is Tomoe.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t even remember it until she was asked about it, but it seems the result was a big failure.</p><br/><p>Quite the amount of elites had fallen at the wasteland.</p><br/><p>Toa\u2019s ancestors as well.</p><br/><p>Their heirloom that was an important dagger was lost there, their family chased down to every place and had to move around repeatedly, and because of that, Toa became an adventurer and came to the wasteland to search for the dagger of her ancestors. And as she was about to die, her sister, Rinon, got acquainted with me, and after some twists and turns, Toa and her on the verge to death party members are currently the top team in Tsige.</p><br/><p>Well, you really don\u2019t know what life might bring you.</p><br/><p>Right now, that dagger has safely returned to her hands, and she has decided to make Tsige her home, continuing to contribute to the town as an adventurer and further polishing her skills.</p><br/><p>In its own way, this is a good ending.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the end, the grand labyrinth of Yaso-Katsui had erupted at that time, so he had to head there to reduce the damage it would cause, and in that space of time, the foolish expedition was carried out, and\u2026in the end, well, that\u2019s how I am here now in a sense. Because there\u2019s that part as well, within the Adventurers of Origin, Aznoval is the one I like the most.\u201d (Toa)</p><br/><p>I see, I see.</p><br/><p>So there was that kind of connection huh.</p><br/><p>But looking that far in the past and the far future that is now, I don\u2019t think it would be a reason why Aznoval would come to Tsige.</p><br/><p>Well, at least it is deeper than her simply knowing, but I feel like it is a bit weak.</p><br/><p>Wait, she said something incredible in such a nonchalant manner.</p><br/><p>What did she say about the labyrinth?</p><br/><p>Erupted?</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t that supposed to be what volcanoes do?</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease wait there. That labyrinth can erupt?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I tried asking about it.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no way that\u2019s the case.</p><br/><p>In the lines of common sense, that is. But that place doesn\u2019t apply common sense\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t lived that long in Lorel, so I don\u2019t have much knowledge about it. But it seems like it is a place where those kind of things happen as well. At that time, he ate two Board Fruits, which are his source of power, pushed through the lava, and opened a deep hole to calm it down.\u201d (Toa)</p><br/><p>I do remember hearing that Toa and Rinon were born in a place close to the Empire.</p><br/><p>Since they were born, they haven\u2019t gone to Lorel Union once.</p><br/><p>So even if I ask her more about it, she wouldn\u2019t know.</p><br/><p>It would be dangerous if it erupts while we are inside.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s try asking everyone regarding that when I return.</p><br/><p>If there\u2019s any signs of it, we would have to hurry.</p><br/><p>Even so, doing things like stopping eruptions, just like Serwhale-san.</p><br/><p>Looks like he is quite the person.</p><br/><p>The last part about some sort of fruit was probably added in the story, so leaving aside the details, there\u2019s no doubt he did some sort of big exploit to stop the damage.</p><br/><p>For some reason, it reminded me of the classic hero that ate spinach from a can to get buffed up. </p><br/><p>\u201cI see\u2026\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026It feels as if Raidou-san gets involved in the mysteries of the world one after the other. I feel like you are having more of an adventure than adventurers.\u201d (Toa)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is certainly true that that\u2019s how it ends up as a result. It is not to my liking, but I can\u2019t deny it.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026In those days, there was a Superior Dragon called Waterfall in Limia Kingdom that provided the lake\u2019s blessings; in Gritonia Empire, there\u2019s one named Grount that lived at the desert and provided trials, and anyone that passed those received a blessing; on the other hand, Lorel and Aion were one head lower than the other two within the major powers, but they were in a delicate line that was still enough to consider them major powers, and\u2026because they were in such a delicate line, they were desperate to obtain the power of a Superior Dragon. Really\u2026what a stupid story.\u201d (Toa)</p><br/><p>Toa knows about this pretty well.</p><br/><p>Is it because it was passed down in the past of his family, or maybe she herself took interest in it and investigated?</p><br/><p>Since we are talking about Toa, who personally came to the wasteland in order to recover the dagger, it might be possible.</p><br/><p>Anyways, so the reason of that expedition in the past was because they were planning on beating up Shen and bringing her back to the country?</p><br/><p>If that\u2019s true, then it really is a foolish story.</p><br/><p>If I was there at that time, I might have told them to stop it as well.</p><br/><p>Even in Limia, it was only because the lake was within the boundaries of their country; in Gritonia as well, it is not like the White Desert was prepared by the Empire to call Grount there, it was simply Grount being there since the beginning.</p><br/><p>Lorel also had Futsu since the beginning, and the labyrinth also should have had Doma as well.</p><br/><p>And yet, why did they go through the trouble of going to the wasteland for Shen?</p><br/><p>Wait, it seems like the labyrinth already existed by that time.</p><br/><p>And yet, Lorel didn\u2019t know that there was a Superior Dragon within their own country?</p><br/><p>Is that even possible?</p><br/><p>!</p><br/><p>Or it could be that, at that time, Doma was not a Superior Dragon\u2026</p><br/><p>No wait, that\u2019s questionable too.</p><br/><p>\u201c*Whistle~*\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>Root blatantly evades my gaze of suspicion.</p><br/><p>He is trying to avoid it.</p><br/><p>No, I won\u2019t let you escape.</p><br/><p>You are also involved in this?</p><br/><p>In the future, whenever it is related to Superior Dragons, I will just place this guy as the number one suspect.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so. It is not such a pleasant story for you, and yet, I made you speak of it. I am really sorry. Even so, if there\u2019s any other thing you remember of him, can you please contact the company? I want to know about the knight Aznoval and the Adventurers of Origin as much as possible since it is connected to the matter I am involved in.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is already all in the past anyways. I don\u2019t mind. When I return to my house, I will investigate about it again!\u201d (Toa)</p><br/><p>Past huh.</p><br/><p>I am probably the weird one here.</p><br/><p>It is true that this is a past that has already concluded.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s nothing I can do this late in the game.</p><br/><p>At the very least, Toa, who has already accomplished her own objective, is probably living her life now.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s not wrong. It even feels dazzling.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you very much.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, with this, I will be excusing myself. Vegan-san as well, see you later.\u201d (Toa)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, thanks for guiding me. Also, sorry. That name is actually fake.\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was for the sake of safety. There was not a shred of intent to deceive you. I am glad I met you, Toa. The staff of the Adventurer Guild in Tsige and the top adventurers in Tsige are splendid. If every place had this amount of liveliness and tension, I wouldn\u2019t have any complains. As the Guild Master, Falz, I consider this my pride.\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cFal\u2014eeeeh?!\u201d (Toa)</p><br/><p>\u201cAhaha. If you want to, I can make the preparations to hire you under the direct staff of the Adventurer Guild. If you are in the mood to, tell the people in charge anytime you want, okay? Well then, Raidou-kun, let\u2019s go to the Kuzunoha Company.\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>What\u2019s that about Falz. That\u2019s also a fake name.</p><br/><p>Root really does lie as easy as breathing.</p><br/><p>Is he actually the same type as Rona?</p><br/><p>However, even if you try to look proper when you are being restrained in midair, your dignity right now is zero.</p><br/><p>He said \u2018Let\u2019s go\u2019, but he himself can\u2019t even move.</p><br/><p>On top of that, Root, your nose is running.</p><br/><p>Ah, that\u2019s not it.</p><br/><p>You have a nosebleed.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Hah\u2026\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, Raidou-kun, what\u2019s that sigh for? Eh, why does my head feel funny? Ah, it kind of stung. Is this nosebleed? It is nosebleed, isn\u2019t it? Raidou-kun, my nose is bleeding!!\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>Well, your face was punched in after all.</p><br/><p>Of course you would get some sort of injury from that, even if it is you.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, everyone, sorry for the trouble here.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I bow my head once.</p><br/><p>I could tell there was an uncontrollable atmosphere in the air.</p><br/><p>I won\u2019t take responsibility for this.</p><br/><p>Cause I have to talk with this Root now after all.</p><br/><p>I will probably not be refreshed with this.</p><br/><p>But it would be nice, if even a little bit of this fuzziness inside of me is cleared.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Don\u2019t worry, I wasn\u2019t angry or anything. I just wanted to warn the people, who probably didn\u2019t know, that those type of talks actually do affect me.</p><br/><p>Btw, this doesn\u2019t count the opinions about the story in itself, points of views are varied and I don\u2019t mind them giving it out. It\u2019s just the dropping part I can\u2019t handle well. Just that one part, there\u2019s absolutely no need to say it.</p><br/><p>I know those are the minority and I love this community, so there\u2019s no way I would leave because of that reason, of that I can assure you.</p><br/><p>All forms of cheering came to me, I was actually quite surprised. Thank you very much to everyone that did so! It made me really happy. It reminded me of how worth it was to take up translation! ^^</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me\u201d</p><br/><p>A clear voice resounds in the guest area that is being controlled by bewilderment.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s a carpet spread out and seats lined up. A room that divides it from the general seats.</p><br/><p>So this is the guest seats huh.</p><br/><p>Tomoe\u2019s voice resounds well. It probably gathered the attention of all the countries\u2019 big-shots onto her.</p><br/><p>There were some gazes my way too though.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you guys?! Don\u2019t you know that this area is off limits?!\u201d</p><br/><p>A face that I have seen in portraits shouts at us.</p><br/><p>Ah, this guy is the academy\u2019s principal.</p><br/><p>I never know where he was, and of course, I have never met him before, so I couldn\u2019t tell it was him immediately.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease do forgive us in this emergency situation. It seems you guests haven\u2019t evacuated to a safe place, so it may be out of our way, but we thought we should lend our assistance\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Tomoe didn\u2019t show any sign of being angered and tells the academy principal her business.</p><br/><p>At that moment, I noticed that there was a girl that send her gaze to Tomoe.</p><br/><p>From what I can tell, she looks like a girl with social status.</p><br/><p>She looks young, so maybe the next generation head of some noble family? Or maybe a princess of somewhere?</p><br/><p>N, princess?</p><br/><p>I feel like Tomoe might know something\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Could it be, this woman is the Gritonia Empire\u2019s princess, Lily?</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s really, then she is quite the big-shot.</p><br/><p>But it seems she is traveling with the hero, so it would be strange for her to be here.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s the chance that she is not her huh.</p><br/><p>I felt like there was a familiar gaze on me and when I turned to check who it was, I see a silver haired young man leaning his back on a wall with arms crossed.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t know what\u2019s so fun, but he is smiling, and he unfastens his arms and waves his hand at me.</p><br/><p>Its pervert Root.</p><br/><p>Right, he was here as well.</p><br/><p>Damn it.</p><br/><p>Then there was no need to come here to help them?</p><br/><p>If he comes talking to me about strange things, it would not be good for me or my company.</p><br/><p>But it seems Root doesn\u2019t intend to move into action. He crosses his arms again, his wide smile returns to a slight smile, and he silently looks at Tomoe again.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t get him.</p><br/><p>Is he not worried about the Adventurer Guild?</p><br/><p>I do think that that place is also facing danger though?</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst of all, introduce yourself! I don\u2019t know about you\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry for my lack of manners. I am Tomoe, one of Kuzunoha Company\u2019s employees, Academy Principal. And this person here is my master Raidou. He has an impairment that doesn\u2019t allow him to speak, so I, his follower, am the one who has to introduce him. Please do understand\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cTomoe and Raidou huh\u201d</p><br/><p>[Pleasure to meet you Academy Principal. I am a temporary teacher working here, Raidou. I considered this an emergency situation so I thought I would help out and so I have come here. Please forgive our rudeness]</p><br/><p>\u201cWritten communication. I see, it is you. I do remember there\u2019s a temporary teacher named Raidou\u201d</p><br/><p>It seems he at least knows that I use written communication, and I also show a plate which serves as a certificate that proves I am a temporary teacher.</p><br/><p>Looking at me, the written communication, and the proof; the tone of the Academy Principal softened.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am glad you have understood\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said assistance, but what kind of assistance do you intent to provide? In this situation where we only know that there are monsters in town, there\u2019s no way you can guide us to a safe place you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAcademy Principal, you know of several places that are safe right?\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, we have already secured a place in times of emergencies. Relaying composed orders and sorting information in a dangerous place is something I would want to avoid\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen if you tell us of that place, I will use teleport magic to send everyone there\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Teleport? Teleport you say?! This amount of people, in a place the magic user hasn\u2019t gone to before?! Impossible. I have never heard of a spell like that!\u201d</p><br/><p>For a second, the Academy Principal lets out a dumbfounded voice, but he soon understood the content and splendidly rejected Tomoe\u2019s plan.</p><br/><p>There are times I do think we leisurely use thought transmission and teleportation too much.</p><br/><p>The teleporting technique is originally an advanced spell and not something one can leisurely use, and in thought transmission there\u2019s the thing about distance and tapping, and it is user-friendly, so it is used in the general populace, but the one we use is practically a completely different thing.</p><br/><p>It wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to compare the transmission quality to a bad-performance transceiver and a satellite telephone.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you know, it is actually possible. Well, it certainly can\u2019t be helped that this is being suspected as a trap. Fumu\u2026\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why it is troublesome to explain this complicated teleportation though.</p><br/><p>Tomoe doesn\u2019t really look like she is troubled.</p><br/><p>Maybe she has a method to convince them.</p><br/><p>The only thing I thought of is having one person test it to show it works.</p><br/><p>Well, having that one person cooperate will be the troublesome part though.</p><br/><p>They are all big-shots after all.</p><br/><p>Is there anyone I know that can help out?</p><br/><p>Uhm, excluding the pervert\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAhahaha! What an interesting person, Academy Principal. Truly interesting. It\u2019s true that I have never heard of such an excelling magician with such a teleport spell\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cFalz-dono\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPerson called Tomoe, how about trying it out on me first. Right, can you teleport me to the guest seats around that part there? It is fine if I just picture it in my mind right?\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>Root.</p><br/><p>Acting as if he has never met her before, he volunteered as a test subject.</p><br/><p>Tomoe probably knew this would happen, she didn\u2019t look shaken at all.</p><br/><p>Well, even if he is like that, he is still the Adventurer Guild\u2019s Master.</p><br/><p>He must have a decent amount of trust.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour name is Falz-dono right? Then, please enter inside this mist\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh~, the other side also has mist appearing huh. Well then, let\u2019s try it out and see if such a convenient spell actually exists\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>In the place where Root pointed out with his finger, there\u2019s also mist appearing. And while still playing the fool, he disappears into the mist, and at the next instant, he comes out from the place he pointed out.</p><br/><p>He then turns his head towards the guest seats and waves his hand.</p><br/><p>Tomoe glanced at the princess(?) who has her hands on her mouth and her eyes wide open.</p><br/><p>Looks like she is quite surprised.</p><br/><p>Root walks through the mist on that side and returned.</p><br/><p>\u201cAmazing, that\u2019s quite a significant feat! This is the first time I have seen such a great spell! From what I see, that was a power created from the sword hanging at your waist, right?\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>What kind of crazy thing is he saying?</p><br/><p>What Tomoe used was teleportation.</p><br/><p>It comes normally from herself.</p><br/><p>He should also know about the application of our space teleportation.</p><br/><p>I really don\u2019t know what he is thinking.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou got me. Falz-dono has quite the scary eyes there. That\u2019s right, this is the special power of this sword. No need for aria and it allows for a point to point teleportation\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u2026 Hm?</p><br/><p>Tomoe is following?</p><br/><p>But unrelated to my confusion, Tomoe and Root were looking at each other and grinned slightly.</p><br/><p>Why?</p><br/><p>Of course, everyone\u2019s gaze gathered at Tomoe\u2019s sword simultaneously.</p><br/><p>To the shorter katana that she pointed out.</p><br/><p>Oh.</p><br/><p>I notice that there are other faces I know.</p><br/><p>The priest and Lorel\u2019s\u2026 Sairitz-san, was it?</p><br/><p>So they also came to spectate the tournament.</p><br/><p>There were several more important-looking people than priest-san at his side, so it took me some time to notice him.</p><br/><p>The priest-san is one of the highest positions in the Rotsgard church, so that means, the people there are even higher than that. They might even be from the main church of Limia.</p><br/><p>I took time to notice the Lorel people simple because they were at a corner.</p><br/><p>Sairitz-san is there too, but there are also many others there as well.</p><br/><p>Most of them have darkish skin.</p><br/><p>Are the people there mostly of that skin color?</p><br/><p>Maybe she noticed my gaze, Sairitz-san made a smile for a second.</p><br/><p>She soon returned her interest to Tomoe\u2019s sword though.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe it\u201d</p><br/><p>The Academy Principal was at a complete loss for words.</p><br/><p>Teleportation in itself is an extremely advanced technique, and just the fact of being able to use it, you would be admired.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why, in order to make this advanced technique as easy to do as possible, they recreate the teleport formation accurately, and there\u2019s also support formations that reduce the burden.</p><br/><p>And to be told that this action can be done with the power of a sword, moreover, allowing you to teleport to a specific location; there\u2019s no surprise that they wouldn\u2019t believe it.</p><br/><p>Well, for the common sense of this academy, it is something they wouldn\u2019t even think it exists.</p><br/><p>And this is also proof that this is not something common.</p><br/><p>The influential people that come from several countries are all concentrating their eyes on that sword.</p><br/><p>Hope this doesn\u2019t become a new spark.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is it, everyone? Since they went through the trouble of coming to help us, how about relying on them?\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>Root looks at everyone and proposes this idea.</p><br/><p>It seems he will incite them for us.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know if this guy is an enemy or an ally, but it seems that in this moment at least, he will act as our ally.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Right. It is just as Falz-dono said. Raidou-dono, I thank you for your courageous action, and I promise I will definitely repay you for it. On the name of Gritonia Empire\u2019s Lily. What about the others?\u201d (Lily)</p><br/><p>Gritonia\u2019s Lily.</p><br/><p>So she really is the princess.</p><br/><p>She even came for the school festival, impressive.</p><br/><p>Maybe she also attended this academy?</p><br/><p>I feel like she glanced at Tomoe for an instant, but I don\u2019t know her intentions.</p><br/><p>From what I have heard of Tomoe, they don\u2019t have that deep of a connection and just parted at that point in time.</p><br/><p>With Lily\u2019s words as the impetus, several \u2018me too\u2019 \u2018me too\u2019 were raised and more people decide take our helping hand.</p><br/><p>People are willing to.</p><br/><p>The people related to the Church, the Lorel Union, and also the nobles that seem to be from Aion. The Academy principal, who is being shouldered by a woman that looks like his secretary, also agreed with it.</p><br/><p>Or more like, old man, why did your legs weaken to the point of needing someone to lend you a shoulder?</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t that sexual harassment?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe people there as well, please decide quickly\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Tomoe hurries the remaining 5, but they didn\u2019t show signs of moving.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s going on?</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t think there\u2019s significance for a guest to be staying here though.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 This one is fine here. I have the duty to overlook this\u201d</p><br/><p>This one? </p><br/><p>Is he a king?</p><br/><p>Duty to overlook he says. He is looking at the stage.</p><br/><p>The fight between the students and the monster huh.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, that is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou all, return\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKing, we can\u2019t do that. The one standing on that stage is my child after all\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026 That\u2019s the Limia group.</p><br/><p>Ilumgand\u2019s father, the Limia King, and he said \u2018father\u2019 so maybe the prince?</p><br/><p>Judging from the bearings of the remaining 2, they are probably knights.</p><br/><p>So they are a totally related party huh.</p><br/><p>What to do?</p><br/><p>I think the best choice would be to shelter the other people first.</p><br/><p>\u201cWaka, I will be bringing the people here to the safe place that the Academy Principal is thinking of\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>I was about to give the orders to Tomoe and looked at her, but she was one step ahead of me.</p><br/><p>Of course, that\u2019s what I wanted her to do, so I nod.</p><br/><p>A mist a lot bigger than the one Root crossed appears.</p><br/><p>It looks like haze, but it has a thickness that makes you unable to see the other side.</p><br/><p>It does make one think that this is a product of magic.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, I will place this katana under Waka\u2019s care. I leave the matters here to you\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201c?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Oi.</p><br/><p>What do you plan by leaving me the short katana?</p><br/><p>I instinctively take the short sword that was given to me and look at Tomoe.</p><br/><p>With a suggestive smile, she disappears into the mist.</p><br/><p>Damn it.</p><br/><p>Uhm, so I should convince the others from Limia?</p><br/><p>But I don\u2019t know the etiquette when talking to a king.</p><br/><p>\u2026 Should I apologize first before going for the persuasion?</p><br/><p>[This is the first time I have met with a person as great as you king, so I might come off as rude. Please do forgive me if that happens]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said your name was Raidou, right? Your written communication is skillful. And your magic should be as well\u201d (King)</p><br/><p>[Yes. I can\u2019t speak common language, so I am using written communication in this way. Once again, I am the one in charge of Kuzunoha Company, Raidou]</p><br/><p>\u201cI know\u201d (King)</p><br/><p>[Hm? Do you mean, you know about my store as well?]</p><br/><p>Why does someone like the Limia King have information of a small store in Rotsgard like mine?</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, Hopelace?\u201d (King)</p><br/><p>\u201c?!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I remember correctly, the company that you were investigating about was the Kuzunoha Company, and about a temporary teacher named Raidou, right?\u201d (King)</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a fact we have already confirmed, Hopelace-dono\u201d (Prince)</p><br/><p>What?</p><br/><p>It seems there\u2019s a completely different development going on now.</p><br/><p>The thin person that\u2019s probably the prince complements the words of the king and shoots them at Hopelace.</p><br/><p>I see, Hopelace.</p><br/><p>That means the various things Ilumgand did have already been exposed huh.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want an explanation Hopelace. Regarding your second son, Ilumgand, that has transformed, and about the calamity that\u2019s occurring in the whole Academy Town\u201d (King)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 King, it is true that I listened to my son\u2019s request and investigated about this teacher. I have also used money to bend the rules in this tournament. However, this situation was definitely not carried out by me. Ilumgand is my son, and he is an important son that might become the head of the family in this warring times. To turn him into that kind of\u2026 that kind of monster to plot something, I would never do it!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Then, why did Ilumgand take an interest in Raidou?\u201d (King)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t know anything!\u201d</p><br/><p>I actually wanted to know that too.</p><br/><p>Why was I hated so much to the point of being investigated and being declared war?</p><br/><p>I only covered for Ruria. Is that something he would get so tenacious about?</p><br/><p>Or was he the type that can\u2019t tolerate disgrace?</p><br/><p>I am not a noble, so it is hard for me to completely understand their thought patterns.</p><br/><p>The Hopelace head repeats his apology to the king over and over again.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will hear about it in detail after we have gotten through this situation and return to our country. But the shame you have made us bear on the many nations, won\u2019t come cheap\u201d (King)</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so, Raidou, you are a merchant right? And a temporary teacher in this academy that teaches practical skills. Are the students fighting there your students?\u201d (King)</p><br/><p>[Yes, there\u2019s no mistake. Those are the students taking my class. Just that, they haven\u2019t been attending it for that long of a time]</p><br/><p>\u201cHoh~. How long has it been?\u201d (King)</p><br/><p>[Less than half a year]</p><br/><p>\u201cHalf a year\u2026 were those kids that strong since then?\u201d (King)</p><br/><p>[No. I began my business in Tsige, so I have seen the fighting style of the adventurers there. I taught them a part of it, and it seems it fit them well, they have been increasing their skills]</p><br/><p>So the Limia King has also taken an interest in them huh.</p><br/><p>Still facing the stage, he continues our conversation.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsige huh. Certainly. The adventurers hero-dono brought from there had a fighting style similar to this one. It seems it is not a lie\u201d (King)</p><br/><p>Adventurers from Tsige in Limia?</p><br/><p>Heh~</p><br/><p>In that case, the current Limia has quite the high leveled adventurers there.</p><br/><p>If the people that the hero recruited were people with the skills to enter and leave the wasteland at will, they will become quite the war potential for Limia.</p><br/><p>Hero.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t enquire any specifics, but she came to a remote place like Tsige huh.</p><br/><p>Thinking about it in a logical manner, the reason she went there would be for training, maybe?</p><br/><p>[King-sama, please come with me to a safe place. There\u2019s no assurance that this place won\u2019t be attacked by other enemies]</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I have the teacher of those splendid students at my side, I don\u2019t have much to worry about. By the way, Raidou, you can use that sword?\u201d (King)</p><br/><p>The Limia King looks at the short katana I hold.</p><br/><p>The made-up story about being able to use teleportation with it huh.</p><br/><p>Tomoe, it is turning into something troublesome you know?</p><br/><p>[Yes, I can. If it\u2019s me or Tomoe who was here a while ago, it can be used]</p><br/><p>\u201cThen can you bring me to that place? If Ilumgand sees me and his father, he might return to his senses\u201d (King)</p><br/><p>\u201cKing, that\u2019s not good. It\u2019s way too dangerous\u201d (Prince)</p><br/><p>\u201cA noble of Limia is causing damage to the Academy. I have to provide my assistance to control this situation as well, or I won\u2019t be able to stand upright. Isn\u2019t that right, Hopelace?\u201d (King)</p><br/><p>Rejecting the words of the prince, the King looks at Hopelace.</p><br/><p>He reacts with a jolt, and makes a small nod.</p><br/><p>He probably doesn\u2019t want to face his transformed son.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, placing oneself in danger is not assistance, but showing that you are willing to is necessary sometimes. If the ones who have to do so are me and Hopelace, then it can\u2019t be helped. A quite blunt and unnatural thing to do, if I do say so myself\u201d (King)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Raidou-dono, can you teleport us over there?\u201d (Prince)</p><br/><p>It seems the prince folded.</p><br/><p>Well, I don\u2019t really mind though.</p><br/><p>Then, I will be acting as the bodyguard of this people for a while?</p><br/><p>[It is possible. Well then, all five, is it okay to teleport you around that seat over there?]</p><br/><p>Saying so, I point to an estimated area.</p><br/><p>The prince nods.</p><br/><p>The knights stay silent.</p><br/><p>Probably means that they will just silently obey. It must be tough for them as well.</p><br/><p>Well, if they carry this out safely, they should gain big points for it.</p><br/><p>At that place there\u2019s Shiki and Mio.</p><br/><p>I put up the short katana.</p><br/><p>Gotta show the act at the very least.</p><br/><p>I create mist that is not that different from the one Tomoe made.</p><br/><p>Mist is created at the pointed out place as well.</p><br/><p>Preparations complete.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will definitely repay you, Raidou\u201d (King)</p><br/><p>The Limia King talks to me.</p><br/><p>It would be weird to part from my katana at this moment, so I just lower my head.</p><br/><p>In my left hand I have the scabbard and in my right the katana. It was pretty unshapely.</p><br/><p>Knight, Hopelace, Prince, and then the King; in order, they disappear inside the mist.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

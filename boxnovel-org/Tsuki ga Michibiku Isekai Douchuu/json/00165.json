The difference in size between a dragon and a person is huge. As a result, the Dragon Knights are treated very differently from regular knights.</p><br/><p>The ones who mainly do the fighting are the dragons themselves, so the abilities expected from these knights also differ from those expected of regular knights.</p><br/><p>The ones who brought supplies to Rotsgard are units that soar through the sky on flying dragons, though there are apparently also units on the ground riding earth dragons.</p><br/><p>They can travel on the ground and in the air but, perhaps because there aren\u2019t many oceans, there aren\u2019t any units using water dragons.</p><br/><p>I heard that the flying dragon units have the advantage in the air for both attack and defense.</p><br/><p>As long as the ace that is the Dragon Knights exists, Lorel\u2019s defenses can be described as an iron wall.</p><br/><p>I can definitely feel their confidence, as if it is overflowing from their bodies.</p><br/><p>No, I should say \u201cwas\u201d.</p><br/><p>I can see the Dragon Knights sensing something unusual and looking worried for their dragons, while the dragons themselves are standing at attention (though I\u2019m not sure I should call it that).</p><br/><p>\u300cHaah... I was looking forward to seeing how amazing these Dragon Knights are, but... Both the riders and the dragons are second-rate.\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u300cI get that you\u2019re in a bad mood, but show some restraint!\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cLeaving Waka and Shiki aside, all I did was split the earth. Rather than sulk, why not simply accept the credit for it as Waka\u2019s own ability?\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u300c... You\u2019re being unreasonable.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>This person is the cause of that.</p><br/><p>When we went back to the academy to deliver our report on the incident involving the mutants, Tomoe discussed something with the country leaders who were still in academy city.</p><br/><p>I think that the various leaders were among them, like people from the temples and Sairitsu-san from Lorel, but Tomoe was exerting an extraordinarily unsettling presence.</p><br/><p>As soon as we entered the academy, as if he\u2019d received some kind of message, Shiki said he\u2019d go to undo the students\u2019 barrier and went in another direction. Now that I think about it, that might have been his sixth sense at work.</p><br/><p>On the surface, it seemed that Shiki felt regret over the short sword being broken, but in reality, it could be assumed that the outburst of fake anger directed at Shiki was the cause.</p><br/><p>While I was delivering my report to the headmaster, I also had to go through the futile mission of trying to calm Tomoe down.</p><br/><p>While talking to Sairitsu-san, the topic of the Dragon Knights came up, so I half-forcefully dragged Tomoe out since she had shown some interest in them.</p><br/><p>\u300cBut they are such opponents that even Mio could toy with them...\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u300cDidn\u2019t you announce that you were aiming to introduce the four seasons to Asora?\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>In reality, that needs a little more work, though.</p><br/><p>\u300cThis is just a vague feeling that I have, but it seems that the rewards are lacking.\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u300cWhy don\u2019t you drink a bunch tonight? And then we\u2019ll enjoy the four seasons. We\u2019re releasing the Japanese alcohol, too, right? I\u2019m looking forward to it!\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>I\u2019ve hardly drank before, so I barely know the taste of Japanese alcohol or whatever.</p><br/><p>But as long as it\u2019s alcohol that the people of Asora find delicious, I think it\u2019ll be fine to say that it\u2019s \u201cJapanese alcohol\u201d.</p><br/><p>\u300cNow that you mention it, what should we do about the alcohol\u2019s name? We should, of course, name it?\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u300cWhy don\u2019t you give it a name? You\u2019re the one who\u2019s been the most serious about it.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, I would definitely like to leave this to you, Waka.\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, I\u2019ll think of a name by tonight.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a cheap price to pay to improve her mood even by a little.</p><br/><p>\u300cI will be awaiting it in anticipation. Hmph, I do pity Shiki since he is always being treated poorly, so perhaps I will be satisfied with the fact that we have been able to obtain the four seasons. Having him so anxious to please me has probably gone too far.\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Tomoe\u2019s expression held no trace of her bad mood as she spoke.</p><br/><p>From my experience of having sisters, I know from this expression that her bad mood had not disappeared for good, but only temporarily suppressed.</p><br/><p>... I guess putting it off till later is fine.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll just let time take care of it.</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019d be great. Anyway... Even though there\u2019s only about twenty of them, the dragons have quite a different presence to them, don\u2019t they? They brought quite a lot of supplies with them for everyone, and I\u2019m sure they\u2019ve made a good impression on the townspeople.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>Riding on dragons.</p><br/><p>It seems I\u2019m not the only one who thinks that\u2019s cool.</p><br/><p>Probably just because they\u2019re rare to see, there are quite a lot of people watching the Dragon Knights from afar.</p><br/><p>They\u2019re presumably people who are looking out for the safety of those nearby.</p><br/><p>The city\u2019s reconstruction might begin as early as tomorrow, or maybe even today.</p><br/><p>\u300cMy opinion on them will not change. A few of them are worth looking at, but most of them are nothing out of the ordinary.\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u300cThat might be the case by your standards.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cBefore you arrived, Waka, I was quite cautious about those men in regards to the future of the company. I would be far more useful than they, who are merely second-rates putting on an act!\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>What did they say with that dangerous atmosphere.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t think these guys would do anything bad, but I\u2019ll ask about it later.</p><br/><p>\u300c... Ah, I see. Well no, I have no intention of comparing you to those guys.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cHmm?\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Did she really think I was comparing her to the dragons that the Dragon Knights are riding?</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t Tomoe a little emotionally unstable today?</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Since we\u2019re in this crowd, I doubt anyone is listening.</p><br/><p>\u300cEven if there were a hundred, or a thousand of them. You\u2019re better to me, Tomoe. So don\u2019t sulk like that.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>I wouldn\u2019t normally say something like this, though.</p><br/><p>\u300c... Sometimes you are an incredible trickster, Waka.\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s not my intention. I know that you\u2019re always concerned about me, Tomoe. I\u2019m grateful for that.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>Expressing your gratitude so earnestly is a bit embarrassing, isn\u2019t it.</p><br/><p>\u300cR-Root also said this. This is what you call, taking a closer look at things!\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ll keep relying on you from now on. Though I\u2019m sure there will be more troublesome things to come.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cI will be in your service.\u300d</p><br/><p>Root, huh.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s likely, too.</p><br/><p>But I intend to pay off my relatively large debt.</p><br/><p>Using that, I think I can probably get Root to approve the fact that Kaleneon didn\u2019t disappear.</p><br/><p>When the other countries discover the existence of Kaleneon later, the Ansland sisters who are its representatives, Eva-san and Ruria, will probably start leading it.</p><br/><p>For now, we\u2019ll be supporting them, but they won\u2019t last unless the hyumans and demi-humans cooperate.</p><br/><p>They\u2019ve even lost their faith in the goddess, so it will be the first country to be built from such a mess.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m actually looking forward to how it\u2019ll turn out.</p><br/><p>They\u2019re dependent on us for now, but I don\u2019t intend for that to continue for long.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t intend for the Kuzunoha company to belong to any one country, either.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll think about that more later on.</p><br/><p>For now, I\u2019m just glad that Tomoe\u2019s mood has improved.</p><br/><p>Next is Mio.</p><br/><p>I guess I\u2019ll just talk to her at the party or something.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u300cSo with that. From tomorrow or the day after, the four seasons will begin in Asora. I think there\u2019ll be some inconveniences with this as well, but let\u2019s all work together to deal with them.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>It\u2019s evening.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m not used to this kind of thing, but I just gave an opening speech for the party.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ve told everyone about the battles that took place last night - our involvement in the Rotsgard\u2019s restoration and the revival of Kaleneon. After that, I just warned them about the possible effects of the four seasons beginning here.</p><br/><p>All eyes are on me as I raise the cup in my right hand.</p><br/><p>\u300cCheers!\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300eCHEERS!\u300f(Everyone)</p><br/><p>With those words, the seal on the alcohol is quickly broken and everyone gathers towards the plates of food.</p><br/><p>I sit down in my own seat, which is slightly elevated above everything else, and start eating.</p><br/><p>The drink that\u2019s being poured is the Japanese alcohol made in Asora by Tomoe and the others.</p><br/><p>Its taste and feel is similar to that of the Japanese alcohol in my distant memories.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know much about Japanese alcohol so I wasn\u2019t much use in its reproduction, so from here on it\u2019ll probably get milder or stronger depending on Asora\u2019s tastes.</p><br/><p>I congratulate Tomoe on completing the alcohol, and join her in a toast as she enjoys herself.</p><br/><p>\u2026 My drink is poured into a large cup that\u2019s more like a tankard, and it\u2019s somewhat different from how I expected it to be. I can\u2019t get away from the smile that is covering her entire face, so I\u2019m stuck drinking this.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll be honest.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m not sure if I can drink it all.</p><br/><p>This Japanese alcohol is actually pretty strong, too.</p><br/><p>No, just for today, I\u2019ll somehow force myself to drink it all.</p><br/><p>There are some tough guys already pouring themselves another.</p><br/><p>But as for me\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cThis is a wonderful celebration, is it not, waka-sama?\u300d</p><br/><p>Before long.</p><br/><p>Kakun-san, the winged people\u2019s elder has come to my seat.</p><br/><p>This is it.</p><br/><p>Since an important person from an important group of people has come, not finishing my drink is not an option.</p><br/><p>So I think I\u2019ll be able to finish this one tankard - no, I\u2019ll be forced too.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a weekday tomorrow and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll have a hangover...</p><br/><p>To think that I\u2019d be having an office worker\u2019s problems in my teenage years.</p><br/><p>\u300cOn this occasion, everyone worked considerably hard. So this is just my way of thanking you all.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cBecause we helped in Kaleneon, our efforts were also acknowledged. Thank you very much.\u300d(Kakun)</p><br/><p>\u300cI have been making my judgments based on the battles I have been involved in, but I think I will start taking into account the results of practice battles with the other groups. I apologize for having such biased views up until now.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300c... Not at all, Waka-sama. Either way, we will have our abilities acknowledged, even in practice battles with you. Also, please speak at ease, as you do with Ema-dono.\u300d(Kakun)</p><br/><p>\u300cTo treat me with such respect, thank you. No, I will do my best. Today, we have the drink made by Tomoe and the food made by Mio, so please enjoy them as you like.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, the Japanese alcohol is popular with everyone. Of course, including myself. Ah, if I continue being the only one talking to you, that would cause problems for the people behind me. As such, I will now excuse myself.\u300d(Kakun)</p><br/><p>\u300cEh, I think I can spare some time while I\u2019m in Asora so please feel free to come to me.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>The Highland Orcs, the four Arke, the Misty Lizards, the Gorgons.</p><br/><p>The heads and leaders of these groups come one after another to have these flattery-laden conversations with me.</p><br/><p>There was the battle last night, so I was quite agitated about the Orcs and Lizards.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ve tried to fit them into the training schedule and that\u2019ll start tomorrow, so today I\u2019ll show some restraint and let them enjoy themselves.</p><br/><p>The Japanese alcohol is quite popular.</p><br/><p>But either alcohol percentage is too high or the taste is too strong for me; it\u2019s not the kind of drink that I can just chug down.</p><br/><p>However, there are definitely quite a few people that are drinking it as if it\u2019s water.</p><br/><p>Well, because of that, there are quite a few people who have already very drunk, having turned bright red.</p><br/><p>Mio\u2019s new menu has a lot of things that make good snacks to go with alcohol, so that might be another reason why the alcohol is being consumed at such a rate.</p><br/><p>As for its popularity with the hyumans, I have only Lime\u2019s judgment for reference, but\u2026 At the very least, since it\u2019s so popular with the demi-humans, I guess I\u2019ll give some thought about whether it can be turned into a product.</p><br/><p>\u300cWaka-sama, Waka-sama. Please try this next!\u300d</p><br/><p>Mio is bringing dishes of food out one after another.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m thinking she should get someone to bring them out for her, but it seems that she wants to do it herself.</p><br/><p>She\u2019s bringing the food out on small dishes, so the quantity of each dish isn\u2019t much, but there is an amazing variety.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s mostly focused on Japanese food with some Chinese food mixed in, but there\u2019s also some food from this world, too.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s really diverse.</p><br/><p>At this rate, she'll be able to produce French food, which I was never able to cook.</p><br/><p>I have the feeling that some unknown, new cooking will be coming soon, too.</p><br/><p>It seems she\u2019s in a good mood for some reason, so I\u2019m just glad that I don\u2019t have to go through all the trouble I did with Tomoe.</p><br/><p>\u300cMio, don\u2019t just get food, eat some yourself. Here, sit down.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, yes!\u300d(Mio)</p><br/><p>\u300cGood work last night. You fought the enemy general in Kaleneon, didn\u2019t you, Mio? I\u2019m glad you\u2019re unharmed.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>That palm-sized dragon.</p><br/><p>I haven\u2019t heard the detailed story yet.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ve released him into the garden now, but that general was quite shrewd, and I admired him for that.\u300d(Mio)</p><br/><p>\u300cSo that was the general, after all\u2026 What exactly was he?\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cHis name was Reft, and it seemed he was a demon general or something. Following Tomoe-san\u2019s advice, I stopped him from eating anything and he became that size.\u300d(Mio)</p><br/><p>Demon general.</p><br/><p>Demon general?!</p><br/><p>TLN: The first \u201cdemon general\u201d is written in hiragana which conveys only the word's pronunciation, not its meaning. So here he hasn\u2019t yet understood the meaning. The second is written in kanji that contain the meaning, so now he understands.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou\u2019re telling me there was a demon general in Kaleneon?!\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>He was allies with Io and Rona, right?</p><br/><p>He must have been.</p><br/><p>\u300cI mentioned earlier that it was a coincidence. In the end, I was unable to mimic his clever reflection...\u300d(Mio)</p><br/><p>Mio looks a little disappointed.</p><br/><p>No, that\u2019s not the important thing.</p><br/><p>\u300cW-why is that dragon behaving itself now?\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>If it was originally a demon general, it\u2019s probably not even really behaving itself right now.</p><br/><p>But I saw it several times yesterday, and it seemed well-behaved.</p><br/><p>\u300cHe lost his sanity partway through the battle, and began to just mumble to himself. After that, he began innocently chasing after a butterfly. He is quite adorable.\u300d(Mio)</p><br/><p>I see now.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know what kind of person he was before, but it seems Mio toyed around with him and broke him.</p><br/><p>He\u2019s still alive, and he\u2019s apparently a demon general, so we should give him back when we meet the Demon Lord.</p><br/><p>Yes.</p><br/><p>\u300cI-I see.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cMore importantly. Waka-sama, do you remember the promise from the other day?\u300d(Mio)</p><br/><p>\u300cPromise?\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>I try to think back.</p><br/><p>Umm, it\u2019s probably from her contest with Shiki.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, the one where I said I\u2019d listen to one request?\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cYes! That one, exactly!\u300d(Mio)</p><br/><p>Mio quickly brings her face closer.</p><br/><p>But right now, the other leaders are having conversations nearby.</p><br/><p>\u300cI remember it. Once the party becomes quieter, I\u2019ll listen to you, okay?\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cYes! Then I will go to check if the food is being made well. I will be back soon, though.\u300d(Mio)</p><br/><p>\u300cOkay, thanks.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>Now, I wonder what Mio will ask of me.</p><br/><p>I said my words of gratitude to Tomoe, and of course I\u2019m also thankful to Mio.</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s something I can do, I want to do it for her.</p><br/><p>\u300cEris, and even Akua. I wonder why they\u2019re singing and dancing.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>For a moment, I thought I was hallucinating.</p><br/><p>But I blink and the scene hasn\u2019t changed.</p><br/><p>The pair of forest onis are doing a flash dance and singing enthusiastically.</p><br/><p>When did you guys become artists.</p><br/><p>\u2026 They\u2019re actually pretty good.</p><br/><p>I wonder if they\u2019ve practised it.</p><br/><p>Mmm, it\u2019s a good thing, I guess.</p><br/><p>\u300cThey've gotten themselves into quite a state, haven't they? Those guys.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cWaka-sama, it seems you have drunk quite an amount.\u300d(Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u300cShiki. I\u2019ve tried talking to those two subtly, so it might be alright for now.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2026 Thank you for that.\u300d(Shiki)</p><br/><p>How rude.</p><br/><p>I haven\u2019t drunk that much yet.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s only my third cup.</p><br/><p>\u300cThe first thing I did in the morning was help Ema and Mio-dono to get ready. So I had no hand in the preparation of the food today.\u300d(Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah, that was a smart choice.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cMio-dono and I went around the port town looking for and discussing food ingredients, so I believe we should have new products for you to taste in the near future.\u300d(Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m looking forward to it.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>Since there aren\u2019t any seas in Asora, huh.</p><br/><p>\u300cIf possible, I wished to speak to you regarding the lectures for the students later, but it seems that would be best saved for another day.\u300d(Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u300cI don\u2019t really mind. For now, we\u2019re still focused on the city\u2019s restoration so I don\u2019t think we\u2019re in any hurry. More importantly. Shiki, you should drink some Japanese alcohol too, it starts to feel lighter after a while.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300c... I thought it was a considerably strong drink. I had some earlier, but I think it would be best enjoyed in small amounts from a small cup like Tomoe-dono is doing....\u300d(Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u300c... Alright. Well then, for now, I\u2019ll give you this one and get myself a new one.\u300d</p><br/><p>I hand Shiki my tankard, which is about seventy percent full.</p><br/><p>For some reason, Shiki has a defeated look on his face.</p><br/><p>I quickly get a new tankard and raise a toast with him.</p><br/><p>\u300cCheers!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c... Itadakimasu.\u300d</p><br/><p>After that, the party is still going on.</p><br/><p>The \u201cthis party doesn\u2019t stop until the sun rises\u201d group are still there, while the \u201cI\u2019ll work hard tomorrow\u201d group have left a while ago.</p><br/><p>We\u2019ve returned to the mansion.</p><br/><p>I think I could work tomorrow even if I kept drinking until morning, but Shiki convinced me that it\u2019d be bad if the lecturer doesn\u2019t show his face tomorrow, so I called it a night \u201cearly\u201d.</p><br/><p>So in this room, there\u2019s Tomoe, Mio, Shiki and myself.</p><br/><p>\u300cI have to say, the Japanese alcohol was well-made. I will improve upon it even further, so please look forward to it, Waka.\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah. It\u2019ll get colder from now, so something like hot sake would be good, too.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cHot sake! I see, I had forgotten about that.\u300d</p><br/><p>We discuss our thoughts on the Japanese alcohol - no, on the party itself.</p><br/><p>Oh, yeah.</p><br/><p>Seeing Mio grinning next to Shiki, who is wearing a complicated, troubled expression, I remember.</p><br/><p>\u300cMio, the request that you had. Have you decided on it already?\u300d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, I have to listen to her request.</p><br/><p>Come at me with whatever request you\u2019ve got.</p><br/><p>\u300cY-yes. I\u2019ve decided!\u300d(Mio)</p><br/><p>\u300cSo, tell me. What do you want me to do?\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>As I ask her, I\u2019m a little suspicious. For some reason, Mio\u2019s previously-smiling face has changed to a stiff expression.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, I will tell you my request.\u300d(Mio)</p><br/><p>\u300cMhmm.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cPlease make me your a-attendant!\u300d(Mio)</p><br/><p>\u300cAttendant?\u300d[Hiragana] (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Attendant? [Hiragana]</p><br/><p>Attendant, huh. [Kanji]</p><br/><p>So in other words, the oldest trick in the book.</p><br/><p>\u300cYes! Tonight, with me...\u300d(Mio)</p><br/><p>\u300cHooh...\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u300cAs I thought...\u300d(Shiki)</p><br/><p>Maybe Tomoe and Shiki had already expected something like this; they say just a few words in reaction.</p><br/><p>Hmm, well, this was outside of my expectations.</p><br/><p>Something to do with cooking, or a trip.</p><br/><p>I was expecting something like that.</p><br/><p>\u300cA-am I asking too much?\u300d(Mio)</p><br/><p>I\u2019m staring intently at Mio, and her upturned eyes are returning my gaze.</p><br/><p>She\u2019s kind of cute.</p><br/><p>\u2026 I see.</p><br/><p>\u300cAttendant, huh.\u300d</p><br/><p>I briefly say the word again.</p><br/><p>I\u2019d like my first time to be with her, since I like her.</p><br/><p>Or so I thought.</p><br/><p>Disregarding the fact that she\u2019s of the opposite sex, I don\u2019t dislike Mio.</p><br/><p>If I had to choose between like and dislike, I definitely \u201clike\u201d her.</p><br/><p>But being inexperienced, I\u2019m not sure if I could lead her properly.</p><br/><p>\u300cExcuse me, Waka-sama?\u300d(Mio)</p><br/><p>\u300c...\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c...\u300d</p><br/><p>I\u2019m being stared at by my three followers.</p><br/><p>They\u2019re really getting me good here.</p><br/><p>If she really desires me.</p><br/><p>\u300c...\u300d(Mio)</p><br/><p>For some reason, Mio is holding her breath.</p><br/><p>I might be making you wait here, but I\u2019m not going to reject you, Mio.</p><br/><p>Alright, I\u2019ve got it.</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s something I can give, I want to answer Mio\u2019s request.</p><br/><p>\u300cMmm, alri-\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cI made a mistake!\u300d(Mio)</p><br/><p>\u300cFueh?\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cI did not mean attendant~deshita wa.\u300d(Mio)</p><br/><p>\u300cEh?\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cYou\u2019re thinking of the wrong \u201ctogi\u201d. I wanted you to teach me a method of washing rice to make it delicious.\u300d(Mio)</p><br/><p>TLN: \u201cAttendant\u201d is pronounced \u201c/togi\u201d in Japanese. The word for \u201cmethod of washing (rice)\u201d is \u201c\u304e/togikata\u201d.</p><br/><p>\u300cEh, but just now, you said \u201ctonight\u201d -\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cTomorrow! I wanted to taste it in tomorrow\u2019s breakfast!\u300d(Mio)</p><br/><p>Mio?</p><br/><p>What, but I thought she definitely said, \u201cPlease make me your attendant\u201d...</p><br/><p>What?</p><br/><p>\u300cBufu!\u300d[Snorting sound] (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u300c... Ku.\u300d(Shiki)</p><br/><p>Tomoe and Shiki burst into laughter, as if unable to restrain themselves.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s so funny?</p><br/><p>Hmm, I didn\u2019t think I was that drunk, but did I do something strange?</p><br/><p>\u300cTomoe-san, Shiki! Please be quiet for a moment!\u300d(Mio)</p><br/><p>\u300cS-sorry. Bufu, ku, ahahaha!\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u300cMy apolo\u2026 Ku, fufu...\u300d(Shiki)</p><br/><p>It looks like Tomoe and Shiki are really enjoying themselves.</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s a funny joke, I wish they\u2019d let me in on it.</p><br/><p>\u300cBoth of you, make sure you remember this\u2026 Waka-sama, well, could you please teach me?\u300d(Mio)</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, sure. But it seems I\u2019m a bit drunk today, so. Would tomorrow be okay?\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300c... Yes. Of course.\u300d(Mio)</p><br/><p>\u300cYou might be better at it than me, but let\u2019s do it together.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, Waka. In that case, I wonder if you could also teach me how to sharpen* my sword.\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>TLN*: The verb \u201cto sharpen\u201d is the same verb (\u3050/togu) as \"to wash (rice)\", so \u201c\u304e/togikata\u201d is used here again. Tomoe is just trolling Mio here.</p><br/><p>\u300cTo-Tomoe-san, you!\u300d(Mio)</p><br/><p>\u300cHow to sharpen a sword? No, didn\u2019t I teach you that a while ago? I don\u2019t know that much about it, though.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>Yeah, I definitely taught her that already.</p><br/><p>But why is Mio being teased by Tomoe?</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, is that so? I suppose I must have confused myself.\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u300cBoth of you, I told you I\u2019ll deal with you afterwards. Leave the room, now.\u300d(Mio)</p><br/><p>Mio is seething with anger.</p><br/><p>Both of them? All Shiki did was laugh a little, though.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, since we\u2019ll be busy tomorrow. For today, it\u2019s best if we just sleep now.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, yes. Waka-sama, good night.\u300d(Mio)</p><br/><p>Mio smiles as she says good night to me.</p><br/><p>No, not just to me, but to everyone\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cWe can go several days without sleep with no problem. So please, relax and rest. I will definitely come to wake you up tomorrow.\u300d(Mio)</p><br/><p>I wonder why.</p><br/><p>I get the feeling that I\u2019m being ordered to sleep.</p><br/><p>Well, it\u2019s true that I have to go to the academy tomorrow.</p><br/><p>I haven\u2019t drunk that much, but it\u2019s definitely a good idea for me to go to sleep.</p><br/><p>But.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s something I want to say no matter what, isn\u2019t there?</p><br/><p>I want to thank everyone.</p><br/><p>Though I kind of just want to make one thing clear.</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah, I\u2019ll do that. But you three, can I say something?\u300d</p><br/><p>As I say \u201cyou three,\u201d Tomoe, Mio and Shiki stop moving.</p><br/><p>I wonder if they can tell from my tone that I\u2019m not messing around now.</p><br/><p>I do still have alcohol in me, but I\u2019m not saying this because I just thought of it, so it\u2019s not a mistake to say it.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou three have been fighting for me, working in Asora and watching the shop, so I\u2019m really thankful. If it was me alone, everything would be half-assed and nothing might have taken form.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300e...\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300cBecause I met Tomoe, I came to know about the world of Asora. We created a home for everyone. Because I met Mio, I remembered cooking and could get along well with the adventurers. Because Shiki was here, the company ran smoothly even when I acted like a spoiled child. It\u2019s really all because all three of you were there that I think I can keep being myself.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300e...\u300f</p><br/><p>If I was by myself, then definitely.</p><br/><p>I would have gotten used to fighting and looked at the world with a skewed perspective.</p><br/><p>I would have been living a no-good life in this other world.</p><br/><p>\u300cI want to give you something to thank you, though it might not be much of a reward. I\u2019ve only given you your first names, but I want to give you the same surname as me, Misumi. I hope you\u2019ll accept it, if you don\u2019t mind.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>If I listen closely, I should be able to hear the noise of the party from here.</p><br/><p>But a small amount of time passes where I can\u2019t hear a single sound.</p><br/><p>\u300c... With pleasure. I said this during the day, but Waka, you really are an incredible trickster sometimes.\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u300cI feel like I\u2019ve been able to get closer to you, Waka-sama. I gratefully accept.\u300d(Mio)</p><br/><p>\u300cFrom now on, I swear to do my utmost to meet all your expectations. There is nothing that would make me happier.\u300d(Shiki)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s good.</p><br/><p>In that case, should my identities merge?</p><br/><p>TLN: In the raw, literally written as \u201cDo I become Raidou = Misumi\u201d?</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll eventually meet Hibiki-senpai, the hero of the kingdom, in some form or another.</p><br/><p>That might be a chance for me, too.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t refuse. I\u2019m going to go rest now, okay?\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>Somehow, it\u2019s become embarrassing to make eye contact with these three now.</p><br/><p>As if running away, I turn my back on the room and leave.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6</p><br/><p>The outskirts of Asora.</p><br/><p>Shiki is lying on the floor, out cold, and the whites of his eyes are visible.</p><br/><p>As proof that a fierce battle has taken place here, there are numerous signs of destruction left across the field.</p><br/><p>Tomoe and Mio are sitting on the remains of a huge tree that has been felled magnificently.</p><br/><p>Shiki twitches occasionally at the side of the tree, and there is a blanket over him, but the two of them show no concern towards him at all.</p><br/><p>\u300cSay, Mio. Why did you make that poor excuse? In that state, I think Waka would have accepted you.\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u300cHmph\u2026 Have you not had enough? What about you, making fun of me in such a horrible way?\u300d(Mio)</p><br/><p>\u300cI am asking why you chose to throw away the opportunity of granting your heart\u2019s desire, to share a bed with Waka. He did consume a considerable amount of alcohol, but I think he was sufficiently conscious, no?\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>The two of them look in the same direction, towards the horizon and the night sky.</p><br/><p>\u300c...\u300d(Mio)</p><br/><p>\u300cFrom my point of view, it seems Waka has grown considerably as a person in the past few days. The previous master might have simply offered to assist in the restoration of the imperial capital of Limia. At the very least, we did not end up having to attack Kaleneon by ourselves.\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u300c...\u300d(Mio)</p><br/><p>\u300cHe was even firm in his resolution when dealing with the dragon slayer. I do not think it would be bad for him to learn the warmth of a woman at this point. If that woman is to be you, I would ignore my usual course of action and encourage you.\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u300c... But duty and gratitude. Because he says such things, I just thought it would be wrong to join my body with Waka-sama\u2019s.\u300d(Mio)</p><br/><p>Mio opens her mouth, breaking her silence.</p><br/><p>\u300cHooh?\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u300cI! \u2026 Rather than because of my own feelings. I just realized that I wanted to join our bodies with him being the one to desire me. Things like \u201cwell done\u201d or \u201cthank you\u201d. It occurred to me that those are the wrong reasons.\u300d(Mio)</p><br/><p>From his true facial expression, she was able to understand how he felt.</p><br/><p>Therefore, before this truth became affirmed, she discarded the opportunity of her own accord.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou want Waka to tell you that he wants you.\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Tomoe simply nods as she speaks, not even looking at Mio.</p><br/><p>A few moments later, Mio also nods.</p><br/><p>\u300cBut you are aware that that would be difficult? Waka is beginning to think of us as his family. Rather than being lovers, you could take him as someone who feels close to you, but it would be a love that is quite different from passion.\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u300cI know that.\u300d(Mio)</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that fine for you? You are aware that your feelings might be unrequited?\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u300cEven so. Even so, I want to truly serve him, to be devoted to him. For now, I want to live with these feelings, this devotion.\u300d(Mio)</p><br/><p>\u300cI see\u2026 It is even more unlikely for Waka to desire my body than for him to desire yours, so I will at least encourage you. Though it may be meaningless.\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u300cHe has not said that there is another woman that he loves. There is no hurry. One day.\u300d(Mio)</p><br/><p>\u300c... Human lives are short, after all. In another few years, it is possible that he will have one or two lovers that he will be married to for life, you know?\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u300cIf it is a woman that I deem worthy, then I can endure~desu wa. I absolutely cannot acknowledge a woman who is unable to cook. And I will have him embrace me just as much as her.\u300d(Mio)</p><br/><p>\u300cAre you his mother-in-law? No, you are even worse. In that case, it will be a long time before we see Waka\u2019s child.\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>These two old, loyal followers spend the night talking to each other.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Thanks a lot! This has been a truly long journey that I hope to see through the end with all of you.</p><br/><p>Well then, enjoy the new chapter of Tsuki Michi! :DDDD!</p><br/><p>I ask myself if this is such a fleeting thing.</p><br/><p>Memories of my past surface in my mind\u2026and disappear.</p><br/><p>Each time I receive attacks, my whole body is filled with power; every time I attack, I can\u2019t injure him \u2013no, not even a single drop of blood flows.</p><br/><p>War Beast and Wings of the Saint; both were powers of renowned Wise.</p><br/><p>For whatever the reason my blood has brought about, both powers are currently residing in my body.</p><br/><p>Not only that, I can even use the summoning power of the Wise Tokito-sama who continuously challenged the Yaso-Katsui Labyrinth on his own, the Hyakki Yagyo.</p><br/><p>With these many powers owned by a single entity, an opponent that can stand against me shouldn\u2019t exist.</p><br/><p>Even when I learned to fight, it only felt empty.</p><br/><p>I was only allowed to crush.</p><br/><p>Being tossed around by political strifes, my wish of remaining married with my loved one couldn\u2019t be fulfilled either.</p><br/><p>The thirst for battle smoldered me.</p><br/><p>Ah, again.</p><br/><p>From that punch I received, there was a magic needle that I couldn\u2019t avoid stabbed deep in between my chest.</p><br/><p>The needle crumbled and Wings of the Saint granted me further defense and resistance.</p><br/><p>Every single attack of this man activates my Wings of the Saint without exception.</p><br/><p>If I didn\u2019t have this ability, I don\u2019t know how many times I would have been killed already.</p><br/><p>How overwhelming.</p><br/><p>This avatar of battle that I could even feel fear from.</p><br/><p>So it was this fleeting.</p><br/><p>Today, I\u2026will be dying.</p><br/><p>In front of my daughter Iroha.</p><br/><p>As a fool that drowned in fake love.</p><br/><p>What confirmed my own end was\u2026a smile.</p><br/><p>The ends of my mouth had unconsciously turned upwards.</p><br/><p>Maybe it was the gratitude of being able to die after bringing out my all, or it might be joy. It could be the irony that I, who could only crush, was now the one being crushed.</p><br/><p>Ah\u2026in the end, I will be leaving without understanding this thing called battle huh.</p><br/><p>Whatever the case, for me, my encounter with this young man is\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c7 \u25c6\u25c6 \u25c7\u25c7 \u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>The fire breath of the fire maned lion had flown into where Jin and others are.</p><br/><p>Around 10 minutes after the arrival of Tomoe, Mio had also regrouped, and she dispersed those flames with a single swing of her fan.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s Tomoe and Mio by the side of Iroha-chan and the others, so there\u2019s practically no need to worry about them anymore.</p><br/><p>I have already shot through the lion and it has dispersed.</p><br/><p>My feet touch the ground after a while of fighting in midair, and then, I look up \u2014at Haruka-san that is looking down directly at me with her loyal mamonos.</p><br/><p>The mamonos were varied; from oriental-like to western-like. There were some who were floating in the air, and some who were placing their feet on the rubble and glaring at me.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s also some who are erasing their presence and hiding in the shadows.</p><br/><p>\u2026And well, there\u2019s the ones that I have already eliminated.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is it? At the very least\u2026you are not getting bored, are you?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>There was no response from her.</p><br/><p>Instead of that, the naginata held in both of her hands shines.</p><br/><p>Two slashes that felt as if they had been swung right at my vicinity were released, but they didn\u2019t manage to hit my body and, after making a slightly high-pitched sound, they disappear.</p><br/><p>On the other side, Tomoe and Mio had finished treating the subordinates of Iroha-chan, and were now simply watching my battle between Haruka-san without saying anything.</p><br/><p>They are not going to interfere.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026.Hm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looks like a number of mamonos were about to change their properties from spiritual to material.</p><br/><p>It must have been an order from Haruka-san, but I won\u2019t allow that.</p><br/><p>I skewer from below the cockroach and centipede at the sides before they manage to do anything.</p><br/><p>I have mostly grasped the abilities of the mamonos and the time they take to be resummoned, as well as the fitting way of dealing with them.</p><br/><p>Leaving aside whether Haruka-san has noticed this, I can see to a certain extent that the Wings of the Saint is reaching its end.</p><br/><p>Haruka-san should have a lower ability at grasping the situation than I do, but she most likely can tell that the current situation is not good.</p><br/><p>In that case, what she should have the most expectations of in order to change the current state of affairs would be the army of thousands that is approaching Kannaoi from outside.</p><br/><p>The chaos that they would create would probably be the only possibility she has right now.</p><br/><p>\u201c?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026Rokuya-san huh. This is incredible.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Well, that\u2019s what I thought, but the outside of the city also showed movements.</p><br/><p>When I look at Tomoe and Mio, the two were furrowing their brows.</p><br/><p>\u201cRokuya? Are you saying that legendary assassin has appeared?\u201d (Haruka)</p><br/><p>Looks like Haruka-san had an idea of the name that I had muttered.</p><br/><p>Instead of answering her, I place strength in my legs and close the distance between us.</p><br/><p>She probably sensed it before I stepped in, she evaded heavily to the right, but I create a scaffold and pursue her.</p><br/><p>With a straight movement that was faster than her, I easily pierce a needle between her chest.</p><br/><p>Haruka-san\u2019s body shines and the needle crumbles.</p><br/><p>It is a spectacle that I am already tired of seeing.</p><br/><p>I stand at the mid-air scaffold and look at her who is biting her lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it seems. That person truly surprises me. To think he had such a hidden trump card.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Leaving aside Rokuya\u2019s affinity against me, he is quite strong.</p><br/><p>And he is quite the ruffian.</p><br/><p>This power that is being shown to me\u2026I see, it is indeed true that it is something that would have been pointless in the battle underground.</p><br/><p>But against many, it can be said to be an incredibly fitting ability.</p><br/><p>Even though he is an assassin, he can fight an army on his own.</p><br/><p>Truly a brave that would make strategists cry.</p><br/><p>(I think you already know, but\u2026) (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>A thought transmission from Rokuya-san.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s only one voice.</p><br/><p>Of course, I already know.</p><br/><p>The presence of Rokuya-san had diffused outside the city, and after that, it increased in numbers \u2014the numbers were exactly\u2026eighty thousand.</p><br/><p>(This is one of my hidden trump cards. *God of War*. Change my body to an army of eighty thousands, but their individual strengths are 1/10th of my original strength. Moreover, it is a troublesome ability that took me close to a century to learn how to control and utilize. Against mighty opponents, it would instead bring about danger, but against an army that\u2019s comprised of normal soldiers, it is quite the important ability.) (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>Rokuya thoroughly explains me his ability.</p><br/><p>Rather than the details of his ability, what interests me more are the circumstances in which made him wish for such an ability though.</p><br/><p>There was no explanation in that regards.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou simply became a weakling and increased in numbers\u2026\u2026 Even if you show us something like that, it is not interesting at all.\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Mio gives out incredibly harsh criticism.</p><br/><p>Looks like what Rokuya-san had whispered to Mio before wasn\u2019t about showing this ability.</p><br/><p>(Hahaha. But, unless I am wiped out, there won\u2019t be any serious wound dealt to me, and it takes 10 days to recast it. There have been an unexpectedly good amount of times in which I have been saved by this ability. Especially in times when numbers become strength. It is a tactic that you wouldn\u2019t normally see in Kuzunoha Company that is more about quality than quantity, right?) (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>(True. Twenty thousand respectively at the east, west, south, and north. If Rokuya-san alone can control all directions, the amount of violence it can cause with just the sheer numbers is nightmarish.) (Makoto)</p><br/><p>(As expected of Makoto-kun. You understand. So, leave the outside to me. Now then, see ya later.) (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The presence of Rokuya-san disappears.</p><br/><p>Power in numbers huh.</p><br/><p>It is true that in Asora and in the Kuzunoha Company, our common policy is to thoroughly increase the quality.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why I might have been neglecting a bit the power that numbers can provide.</p><br/><p>Now that I think about it, in the underground battle, it was the same.</p><br/><p>I might have to take into consideration the people, things, and the amount of material resources before confronting the Goddess.</p><br/><p>Now then, let\u2019s leave this as one thing I should do when I return.</p><br/><p>The Wings of the Saint of Haruka-san will be ending in one or two times more.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know what will happen after.</p><br/><p>If it would leave her in a state of apparent death, that would be the best, but who knows.</p><br/><p>\u201cFire Demonic Being, [Fiery Chariot\u2019s Gun]!!\u201d (Haruka)</p><br/><p>As expected of the ability of a Wise.</p><br/><p>Names I feel I have heard before were coming out pretty frequently from her mouth.</p><br/><p>I think I heard about this Fire Demonic Being from my recently joined follower, Tamaki, who is in charge of the mysterious. With her usual \u2018In the past~~I was called like this\u2026\u2019.</p><br/><p>All she says sounds strangely doubtful, you know.</p><br/><p>Haruka-san summons three new mamonos and charges towards me with two of them in tow -and her naginata in both hands that I have deliberately not destroyed yet.</p><br/><p>Uhm\u2026the one that remained was probably the Fiery Chariot?</p><br/><p>I thought it was a fire chariot, but it looks like that wasn\u2019t the case.</p><br/><p>I won\u2019t be countering or fighting back; if you want to do something, go ahead and do it.</p><br/><p>Will it be some type of new skill, or maybe a team attack that was born from a revelation?</p><br/><p>Taking pointers from it doesn\u2019t sound bad.</p><br/><p>I am someone that doesn\u2019t feel worth about fighting in itself, but if it is Haruka-san who seems to feel worth in bringing out her all, she might be able to find something here.</p><br/><p>\u201c[Demonic Space]!\u201d (Haruka)</p><br/><p>A whole side of my vision was dyed in darkness.</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t see Haruka-san anymore, and the only thing I felt was that my Magic Armor had been attacked.</p><br/><p>Is this an anti-magic attack?</p><br/><p>My Magic Armor had crumbled way too easily.</p><br/><p>I felt like it was different from the time with Azu-san. It felt as if it were a specialized skill.</p><br/><p>\u201c[Anesthetic Slash]!\u201d (Haruka)</p><br/><p>This time, I felt like my arm was cut.</p><br/><p>Though it wasn\u2019t my exposed skin that was aimed at, but an attack that I felt from on top of my coat.</p><br/><p>Maybe this darkness is also affecting Haruka-san slightly.</p><br/><p>Her combat sense is incredibly high.</p><br/><p>If I had the same abilities and speed as her and we were to have a close combat battle, I would have been one-sidedly beaten up.</p><br/><p>But maybe because I have recently fought against a knight that\u2019s more frightening than her, I don\u2019t feel much danger.</p><br/><p>I have gotten a sliver of courage from it.</p><br/><p>I think that, if it is now, a match with Hibiki-senpai won\u2019t go the same way.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you absorb a bit of my magic power?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s how it felt.</p><br/><p>The second attack didn\u2019t injure me, but I could feel that a bit of my magic power was stolen.</p><br/><p>The two attacks were probably a team attack with the mamonos she had with her, but\u2026I don\u2019t think that kind of attack is that effective on me\u2026</p><br/><p>The darkness steadily disperses.</p><br/><p>Now the only thing that remains is the team attack with the Fiery Chariot huh.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cUooooo!!\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>I could hear Tomoe\u2019s shout of high excitement from below.</p><br/><p>For some reason, Mio was overflowing with a displeased aura.</p><br/><p>This happened right before my body was caught by a white something.</p><br/><p>I was more interested in the identity of it than escaping from its grasp, so I didn\u2019t try to get out.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome, Gashadokuro ! Strike your enemy with those grudges of yours!!\u201d (Haruka)</p><br/><p>The upper body of a\u2026giant skeleton huh.</p><br/><p>I see. I certainly have seen that kind of youkai a number of times.</p><br/><p>That Tomoe\u2026she was happy that she was able to see a japanese youkai from up-close huh.</p><br/><p>It is true that the Hyakki Yakou is pretty renowned in my world.</p><br/><p>Hah\u2026</p><br/><p>A bit further away from me, three giant skeletons were floating at my surroundings, and one of them had restrained me with both hands.</p><br/><p>The other two were letting out a purple aura that didn\u2019t look gentle at all and were punching me like crazy without caring about their comrade\u2019s arms.</p><br/><p>Looks like they rank in the strong area within the youkais (or mamonos?) until now.</p><br/><p>Is this not a simple summoning?</p><br/><p>Maybe this is the ability of the Fiery Chariot?</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know at all.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t understand why Mio is in a bad mood either.</p><br/><p>But\u2026when I bring my gaze up while being punched, I could see that it was night and there\u2019s a bright moon in the sky.</p><br/><p>A night view that was truly fitting for many youkais to run rampant with that light that shines in a somewhat mysterious manner.</p><br/><p>Ah, since I have the chance, how about I try it?</p><br/><p>It did succeed when I tested it in Asora.</p><br/><p>This technique that was born from my interests, and a slightly bit from my desire to get back at that Goddess.</p><br/><p>Well, if it doesn\u2019t work, I just have to properly train again at Asora. There\u2019s Tomoe here, so we can also have Shiki and Tamaki think about the reason why it failed if it actually does.</p><br/><p>In a different manner than when I speak normally, visualizing as if I am having having a conversation with someone of another race, I speak while still looking up.</p><br/><p>\u201cMoon.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cUh?! This is\u2026! An aria?! How discomforting it is\u2026!\u201d (Haruka)</p><br/><p>If you are not used to hearing it, it would probably feel that way.</p><br/><p>My followers had also frowned the first time they witnessed this.</p><br/><p>This power of \u2018comprehension\u2019 that the Goddess pushed onto me in order to have me interact with other races at the time when I had just arrived in this world. Later, even though it was something I wished for, the Goddess gave me a life-risking update of the \u2018comprehension\u2019, and it apparently became a part of this thing called \u2018wisdom\u2019 that was inside of me.</p><br/><p>\u2014This is something that I heard from the other Gods, but they are definitely more trustworthy than that Bug Goddess.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy enemy and the temporary lives that she has created\u2026\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>It is normally an ability that activates on its own and allows for conversation, but I can also activate it on my own will towards the targets I wish to communicate to.</p><br/><p>Just by speaking, my surroundings apparently hear it as an incredibly complicated and unknown aria language.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, this is a magic aria.</p><br/><p>It has the effect of buffing, debuffing, and destroying, but the point that should be payed attention the most is that it can be activated at a wide range and can choose the target.</p><br/><p>In other words, its affinity with Sakai is destructively good.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s a matter of course.</p><br/><p>If I remember correctly, Shiki was so excited, saying he didn\u2019t know about this and had never even heard about this before either.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t really care much if this is the discovery of a new element.</p><br/><p>The element of the spell I will be using is just as I announced at first \u2014Moon.</p><br/><p>\u201cShoot them down equally.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>The end of my aria.</p><br/><p>I wonder if it will succeed.</p><br/><p>It succeeded with the moon of Asora.</p><br/><p>\u2018You can even drop meteors in this world, so wouldn\u2019t it be possible for the Moon element to exist?\u2019, that\u2019s the kind of thought process I had when I approached this.</p><br/><p>Then, the effect on the moon in the world of the Goddess is\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you answered me huh. This is interesting.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>A red moon suspended high up \u2014at its surroundings, light rings of the same color were made; they slowly widen, and create a marvellous view.</p><br/><p>They target the Gashadokuros first, and then, Haruka-san and the other ones created by Hyakki Yakou as well.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026[Lunar Halo]\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I mutter shortly the name of the spell.</p><br/><p>As if they had been waiting for that signal, the red rings that were shining with a somewhat rainbow tint\u2026burst.</p><br/><p>They rain down incessantly.</p><br/><p>Rain down.</p><br/><p>Rain down.</p><br/><p>Rain down.</p><br/><p>Rain down.</p><br/><p>Just like an object dropping from space, they dropped at an unimaginable speed, but their light didn\u2019t burn out in the middle of their drop.</p><br/><p>A fragment of moonlight had hit Haruka-san, and the remaining ones pierce the Hyakki Yakou one after the other.</p><br/><p>And yet, that light didn\u2019t hit Tomoe, Mio, Jin\u2019s group, and not even the rubble was being destroyed.</p><br/><p>It was truly accommodating.</p><br/><p>And most importantly, it was a big harvest that I was able to confirm that I can use the Moon element (not yet decided if it should be called that way) in this world.</p><br/><p>The sounds of the surroundings stopped.</p><br/><p>Witnessing a phenomenon of that level, they can\u2019t resume battle immediately huh.</p><br/><p>It has been a while since I have been able to enjoy the silence of the night.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see, so this is the completed version huh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Haruka-san looks straight at me in the sky.</p><br/><p>All mamonos have already been eliminated.</p><br/><p>Those eyes of hers shone a golden light, but there was no magic power or fighting spirit from her body, yet, that abnormal golden light was rising up.</p><br/><p>The Wings of the Saint lets out the same color as Root huh.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat an almighty feeling. To think there would be such a level of power in this world.\u201d (Haruka)</p><br/><p>This is the last strengthening she is receiving after being hit by the lunar halo.</p><br/><p>If Haruka-san is bringing out the last of her strength, that would be the best scenario, but\u2026no, there\u2019s something strange.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s not all there is to it.</p><br/><p>I feel a different being in her.</p><br/><p>Suddenly\u2026my spine shivers.</p><br/><p>Some sort of power was given to Haruka-san right in the last moments of Wings of the Saint?</p><br/><p>In other words, someone who is good at peeking and has been watching the battle?</p><br/><p>\u2026I see. So they finally couldn\u2019t endure it any longer huh.</p><br/><p>I think of a certain possibility.</p><br/><p>A pressure as if I were confronting a Tomoe or Mio that has taken off their limiter and is going berserk \u2014or maybe, even more than that?</p><br/><p>Someone that can provide this much power to a hyuman. I can assert to it.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s by no means many who would be able to do that.</p><br/><p>\u201cRaidou, I have surpassed your calculations.\u201d (Haruka)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026With the assistance of someone?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cWho knows. But with this, I will surely be able to teach you about this thing called battle.\u201d (Haruka)</p><br/><p>\u201cToo bad. I would prefer an answer to my question rather than battling though.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, seek it. But\u2026\u201d (Haruka)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWith your life at stake!\u201d (Haruka)</p><br/><p>Life?</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Sorry, but I can\u2019t give you that.</p><br/><p>It might be a bit of a pain, but\u2026let\u2019s do it.</p><br/><p>I will reach an answer with my own hands.</p><br/><p>And then, if her change was something brought by the Goddess\u2026I will be having a preliminary match here.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

This isn\u2019t a big deal\u201d</p><br/><p>At the outsides of the castle where the flames were beginning to settle, several places of the Limia capital had smoke rising.</p><br/><p>With the large quantity of light swords that rained down not that long ago, it seems like it had enough effect to control the battle between hyumans and demons.</p><br/><p>The sounds of fight have stopped.</p><br/><p>The expression of the man that was facing the giant shadow and spilling out abusive language, it was easy to tell that he was just trying to look tough.</p><br/><p>He was standing on his two legs, but he was quite wounded.</p><br/><p>(I totally agree)</p><br/><p>At the words that the man squeezed out, the shadow standing at a mountain of rubble also agreed.</p><br/><p>But this one was not a person.</p><br/><p>A robe with glossy black and, while few, there were also gold threads added to it.</p><br/><p>Just that, the body that was dressed in it, is a skeleton.</p><br/><p>The hood that was covering its head was taken off and its cranium was laid bare.</p><br/><p>The agreement of his was directed at the words itself, and it didn\u2019t show a single sign of agreeing to the act of toughness of the hyuman male.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s the servant of the devil that is currently fighting with Sofia at the audience room, Shiki.</p><br/><p>After following the hero Hibiki, he was staring at the destruction the light swords created.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt saved me the trouble though\u201d</p><br/><p>Shiki confirms from afar the hero party that\u2019s trying to stand up and somehow fix their stance.</p><br/><p>But his gaze stayed the same.</p><br/><p>It was clear where his interest was directed at.</p><br/><p>The moment he said it saved him the trouble, what he glanced at was Hibiki and the others.</p><br/><p>An adventurer that was heavily exhausted.</p><br/><p>Hibiki who can be seen to be in the same state.</p><br/><p>Using his sword as a cane to stand up, the knight Bredda.</p><br/><p>The Lorel Priestess who is desperately trying to \u2018activate\u2019 healing magic, Chiya.</p><br/><p>And then\u2026</p><br/><p>There was one more remaining that Shiki saw.</p><br/><p>With a hole opened at his abdomen and prostrated on the ground, the magician Wudi.</p><br/><p>Maybe it was a stray shot, or it might be because his defense was not enough.</p><br/><p>Leaving the speculation aside, for Shiki who was thinking about leaving some of her companions half-dead because they are running wild too much, this situation where Hibiki and the others are concentrating in defense and healing is quite ideal for him.</p><br/><p>Truly saved him the trouble.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Lich huh. It doesn\u2019t seem like you are sided with the demon race, but well, I will let you go. Leave\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSuperior Dragon Lancer. \u2018Mitsurugi\u2019. I didn\u2019t think I would be the one meeting you\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>A dragon that is larger than a watchtower was there.</p><br/><p>Shiki knew that superior dragon, and yet, it doesn\u2019t seem like he was scared.</p><br/><p>Actually, it can even be seen as joy.</p><br/><p>The hero party that screamed the name of their companion royal court magician, resounded in the background.</p><br/><p>But it didn\u2019t shake a single emotion from Shiki.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 What is that stance?\u201d (Lancer)</p><br/><p>\u201cMy name is Larva. The servant of the Devil. Now that I say this, you should know my intentions right?\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cDevil\u2026 that kid, had his own troops?\u201d (Lancer)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou understand fast\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>From the body of Lancer an overpowering aura comparable to a dragon\u2019s roar leaks out.</p><br/><p>It was something produced just by being aware of battle.</p><br/><p>Without being bound by it, Shiki holds up his black staff.</p><br/><p>Within the mist that was enough to cover the lower half of an adult, at the ruins of the capital destroyed by the light swords\u2026</p><br/><p>The fight between what is supposed to be only a mere high-ranked undead Lich, and the superior dragon Lancer, began.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6 </p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastard, it seems like you are without doubt the servant of the Devil. Seriously, you are a Lich only in name. Like a \u2018servant\u2019 disguising with the shell of a hyuman\u201d (Lancer)</p><br/><p>\u201cKukuku\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut too bad. Even if you want to put up a fight, I am not just a simple superior dragon anymore. But really, for there to be a servant that has power comparable to that of a superior dragon, as expected of the Devil. Raidou is dangerous\u201d (Lancer)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said your name was Larva, right? You see, I want to hurry and join Sofia, no, I want to kill the Devil with my own hands. That guy, even if it was temporary, he robbed me of one of my legs in the past\u201d (Lancer)</p><br/><p>Shiki continued his silence and Lancer continued his words. His form was showing a change.</p><br/><p>The dragon body of his shrunk and turned into a hyuman shaped one.</p><br/><p>It isn\u2019t the childish body that he had before.</p><br/><p>He now had the appearance of a slender faced youth of around 20 years old like Sofia.</p><br/><p>Different from when he had the appearance of a kid that was exactly the same as a hyuman, at his white skin, there\u2019s a tattoo-like pattern floating.</p><br/><p>The pattern shines slightly and illuminates his appearance faintly, making his atmosphere feel like an illusion.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2018I want to kill him\u2019 That is what I should be saying, Lancer\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou and that mouth of yours\u2026\u201d (Lancer)</p><br/><p>After the words of Lancer, several light swords appear around Shiki as if surrounding him.</p><br/><p>Practically at the same time they appear, a rain of swords attacks Shiki.</p><br/><p>Shiki destroyed some of the swords with spells and secures an escape path, but unable to escape the explosion that the swords made after. He was blown away in the sky as if riding the wind.</p><br/><p>Instead of calling it blown away, it was partly like he himself flew though.</p><br/><p>\u201cLarva-dono, release this mist. If you do that, we can fight as well. We can help you defeat that dragon\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cFuh, Limia hero, it seems like you are not properly seeing the situation. I am not really facing a hard fight here\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Yeah right. No matter how you try, you are just playing way too tough here\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Shiki\u2019s robe was quite damaged and was tattered already.</p><br/><p>And, his opponent Lancer\u2026</p><br/><p>Had an even stronger power coming out of him from the shrunken hyuman body and standing as if nothing.</p><br/><p>No matter who saw this, one can see that Shiki is the one in a predicament.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have received the permission of master. His leeway will be gone now\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster\u2026 that white guy. Larva-dono, let me tell you my honest feelings. That dragon that has made a mess out of this capital and killed a large amount of residents\u2026 let me defeat him alongside you\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Your name was Hibiki, right? That\u2019s impossible. From now on, I will have no leeway to mind you guys. Right now, even the barrier that is protecting you guys, I will most likely be unable to maintain it either\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way! If you release this now, the mist will kill Wudi-san!\u201d (Chiya)</p><br/><p>\u201cLorel\u2019s priestess, there\u2019s no need to worry about that. This mist will disappear soon. Not only that. I will give you guys an appealing proposition\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cAn appealing\u2026 proposition?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Hibiki looks at the cranium where emotions can\u2019t be seen, at its shining eyes.</p><br/><p>Those eyes were looking at Lancer.</p><br/><p>Even when he was talking, Shiki wasn\u2019t looking at Hibiki and the others.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. If you guys stay obedient, that magician there, I will save him later. Of course, with the condition that the priestess there is able to continue her healing though\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c?!! You will\u2026 save him?! An undead like you, save Wudi-san?! A living being?!\u201d (Chiya)</p><br/><p>Chiya\u2019s surprise was quite a normal reaction.</p><br/><p>Normally, an undead can\u2019t use healing magic.</p><br/><p>Only a very few number of undeads are able to, but they by nature hate living beings.</p><br/><p>They hate the light of the living that they themselves have lost.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no way they would actively take the role of saving the life of a living.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why, for Hibiki and the others, Shiki\u2019s proposition seemed odd.</p><br/><p>It is for that reason that, not only Chiya, but everyone there had a surprised expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you saying that you are surely able to safe Wudi in that state?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. A mere thing like a fist sized hole at the abdomen, it is an easy job. In the first place, the line where we consider someone dead is different. Don\u2019t put us at your same level. Now then, how about it? I have gone all the way and proposed this to you though?\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I will believe in those words of yours\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cHibiki!\u201d (Bredda)</p><br/><p>Bredda\u2019s voice of caution.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, this is the correct answer. That dragon is not normal, but this guy is not normal either. The atmosphere he gives off is similar to a certain type of people. People that will do it when they say they will, that kind of people\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut!\u201d (Bredda)</p><br/><p>\u201cLarva-dono, keep your promise\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Hibiki once again tells Shiki words that meant her acknowledgement.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe negotiation has been established then. \u2018Mist Temple, Nivlheim\u2019 cancel. Let me warn you. Try to at least protect your own body, okay?\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Understood\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>One ring disappears from Shiki\u2019s fingers.</p><br/><p>As if proving that it originated from a strange power, the mist rapidly dissipates.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow stubborn. Well, getting you along with the whole hero party is fine as well. Perish with my genuine swords\u201d (Lancer)</p><br/><p>Lancer faces Shiki, no, he fires off several number of swords that were floating in the sky at different directions.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 It seems like, it is time to exhibit my specialty. Hero, and also that knight and adventurer. Protect your body with everything you have. If you don\u2019t want to die, that is\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>It seems like Shiki has grasped the intention of Lancer\u2019s action.</p><br/><p>After a slight delay, a scream was heard.</p><br/><p>\u201c?!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what in the world is going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKukuku, if you are going to hate someone, hate these fools that have dared to stand in my way. You vessel swords, remnant of strong beings that didn\u2019t die\u201d (Lancer)</p><br/><p>Answering the words of Lancer, the several light swords that were shot, once again float in midair.</p><br/><p>No, they were not light swords.</p><br/><p>Red, black, silver, white\u2026 and also normal swords.</p><br/><p>Swords that had substance were floating there.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Blade Dragon, Lancer. But that body of yours is a hybrid that holds two lives. A hyuman dragon, or maybe a dragon kin? I see, Root-dono\u2019s words were truly correct. Your power has increased when you took that form\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c!! Root! You bastard, why do you know that name?!\u201d (Lancer)</p><br/><p>\u201cSurrounded by many famous swords, the supreme dragon called \u2018Mitsurugi\u2019. The true form of those swords are the outcome of the strong beings you have turned into swords\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>Shiki indifferently talks.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I can\u2019t let you live huh\u201d (Lancer)</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph. People that challenged you themselves, strong beings that you had taken an interest in; you turned the tables on them and increased your own collection. Being able to reside in a place close to people must have truly been 2 birds with 1 stone huh\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cLich\u2026 you said your name was Larva, right? You and that hero as well\u2026 turn into a part of my power!\u201d (Lancer)</p><br/><p>The swords plunge at Shiki all at once.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2018Clad this body of mine in malice\u2019 Groth. Shia, \u2018the drifting silver cage that wipes out arrows\u2019 Madhugiri\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>Gently walking forward.</p><br/><p>With his specialty of using soul language, he loudly clacks the aria and approaches Lancer at high speed.</p><br/><p>In a quite short aria, Shiki\u2019s body is clad in something dark red, and on top of that, several ripples were created.</p><br/><p>7 of the 10 swords were pursuing Shiki.</p><br/><p>An attack that doesn\u2019t aim at a place but at an individual.</p><br/><p>But Shiki didn\u2019t stop.</p><br/><p>From the front, the sides, and also the rear; ignoring the swords that were drawing near, he thrusts his staff at Lancer.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastard!\u201d (Lancer)</p><br/><p>Just before a number of the swords hit Shiki, the ripples got in their way.</p><br/><p>After that, Shiki activates the spell he was chanting his aria for.</p><br/><p>The swords distorted heavily and disappear at random directions.</p><br/><p>The two remaining swords collide with the dark red coating and slowly corrode.</p><br/><p>The shock of the big light that occurred from behind, reached even at the place where Shiki and Lancer were.</p><br/><p>It must have been the other three swords that attacked Hibiki and the others</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I am truly lucky. Because something as convenient as this is actually happening after all. The Dragon Slayer Sofia and the superior dragon Lancer that holds the alias Mitsurugi; your sin of injuring one of our own, Tomoe-dono and Mio-dono would have killed you without remorse. I am truly\u2026 lucky\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cKilling me? Just because you have escaped my true swords once, you dare get so ahead of yourself!\u201d (Lancer)</p><br/><p>The thrusted staff was Shiki\u2019s late declaration of war.</p><br/><p>Lowering his staff, Shiki gets happy about his luck as if monologuing.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd, you are unlucky. I have investigated you well. By having a bit of cooperation from what can be called the dragon\u2019s chief, Root-dono\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cRoot! So you bastard really do have a connection with that guy. In that case, the Devil also\u2026\u201d (Lancer)</p><br/><p>\u201cI think that the strongest weapon people possess is \u2018comprehension\u2019. I am a \u2018former\u2019 hyuman, but\u2026 I will proof this by slaying a dragon\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a battlefield. There are elites in the demon race, and in the adventurers of Tsige there are some as well. There are still many casks of strong beings. That composure of yours, I will soon erase it!\u201d (Lancer)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2018Number 6 is my fittest\u2026\u2019\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2018Free yourself from your scabbard and become your true form\u2019, come\u2026 Ascalon\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>Shiki holds the staff with both hands as if brandishing a sword.</p><br/><p>It is a black staff that has few decorations, but with a light similar to that of a red moon, it changed its appearance and becomes a giant great sword.</p><br/><p>Claymore.</p><br/><p>And quite the big one too.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastard, weren\u2019t you a magician?\u201d (Lancer)</p><br/><p>\u201cI am a magician. That recognition is correct. This is a sword smeared with poison and malediction, Ascalon. With my desires of one day being able to hunt you down, I have given this sword the name of a Dragon Slayer after all\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cPoison huh. It is certainly true that it doesn\u2019t have the radiance of a legendary sword. Not even a ghostly aura\u201d (Lancer)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine. I am the one using it, so a beautiful legendary sword doesn\u2019t fit me\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>Leaving the point of the sword on the ground, Shiki holds the claymore with both hands.</p><br/><p>If it were a strong swordsman, that stance there would be inviting for a swipe to break his stance.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is not a sword that a magician can use. If that\u2019s your weapon, your choice was a mistake\u201d (Lancer)</p><br/><p>\u201cSix step \u2018Fray\u2019 release. \u2018Sword Emperor Possession, Sword Spirit Em\u2019\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>Lancer jumps instantly.</p><br/><p>Firing light swords disorderly to the surroundings, he gathers a number of physical swords around him.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor a magician to challenge me with a sword, what mockery!\u201d (Lancer)</p><br/><p>\u201cSwords created from the life of mobs, are no match for Ascalon and Fray. Taste it plenty, the fear of death\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>From the whole body of Shiki, a dark red power swells up.</p><br/><p>The moment that power reached the tip of the sharp Ascalon, Shiki roars, and instantly closes the distance that Lancer still had left. </p><br/><p>At exactly the range of the giant great sword that one wouldn\u2019t be able to measure with one\u2019s eyes unless they normally utilize it.</p><br/><p>The bony arms made a reverse swing with Ascalon and aim at Lancer\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>Several swords made a high-speed automatic defense in between the giant and Lancer, but they were being destroyed one after the other and were unable to accomplish their job.</p><br/><p>\u201cGugh?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lancer himself was only able to make a momentaneous reaction and retreat from that location. He could only take distance.</p><br/><p>His voice didn\u2019t leak only because of that.</p><br/><p>His right hand was dripping with blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I remember correctly, you bastards cut off the fingers of my master\u2026 right? How is it, does it hurt?\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>Seeing that he received exactly the same injury as Makoto, Shiki asks him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 bastard\u2026 Unforgivable!!\u201d (Lancer)</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel exactly the same. What a coincidence\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>After joking, he aims at Lancer with Ascalon.</p><br/><p>In the moment of contact, a strong light was produced.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is quite the different disposition of sword. Ah, it is from your collection huh. As expected of a sword used by past heroes. A wondrous sword you have there\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not all!\u201d (Lancer)</p><br/><p>A red light comes out from inside Lancer\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>Immediately after, a light streak was fired at point blank range towards Shiki.</p><br/><p>That was something that resembled the laser-like attack of Sofia.</p><br/><p>\u201cWa?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shock.</p><br/><p>That voice leaked out from Lancer.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? I am a magician, it is obvious that I will have a barrier spread, right?\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>The light bundle that was supposed to go straight ahead, was refracted and disappeared into the sky.</p><br/><p>A giant great sword not fit for magicians, a firm and skilfull barrier not fit for swordsmen.</p><br/><p>Lancer who was healing the injuries of his fingers, was slowly falling into chaos.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, let\u2019s continue\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>The lights of Shiki\u2019s hollow eye cavities grew stronger.</p><br/><p>Upper, center, lower; at times he would even appear at the back and do an attack as if striking by surprise.</p><br/><p>Shiki was perfectly utilizing the weight of the claymore, and doing a sword dance that showed no openings.</p><br/><p>The light swords imprisonment and the physical swords showed powerlessness akin to leaves.</p><br/><p>The swords that were floating around Lancer and seemed to have special characteristics, were desperately trying to protect their master.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2018Being true to yourself is the light of life\u2019 Stavelot\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastard, in between this battle of weapons you are inputting a spell aria?!\u201d (Lancer)</p><br/><p>The darkness Shiki created that was deeper than night itself attacks Lancer.</p><br/><p>From an outsider\u2019s point of view, there wasn\u2019t much change, but the movements of Lancer had dulled.</p><br/><p>But for the related party, it was quite a weakening that can\u2019t be joked of.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2018Sword that seeks its own return\u2019 Rot Counter\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>Purposely not repelling the sword that was about to reach him, Shiki once again forms a new spell in a calm manner.</p><br/><p>The sword teared against the dark red aura that covered Shiki, but without being able to injure his body, it made a high-pitched sound and breaks.</p><br/><p>As if it cut itself.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou broke the sword of a hero?!\u201d (Lancer)</p><br/><p>\u201cI will be breaking several more until your end, but I don\u2019t think you have the leeway to count every single one of them though\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>While feeling exaltation, and yet, still able to maintain calm, Shiki\u2019s movements were quite the unnatural ones.</p><br/><p>Two things that require extreme concentration to perform, and he was able to perform both at the same time.</p><br/><p>Sword and spell.</p><br/><p>Even the only spectators in that place, the hero party, were clearly able to tell that.</p><br/><p>Even when they are looking from a slightly far away location, they could understand that Shiki was overwhelming Lancer, and were looking at a fierce battle from inside their barrier.</p><br/><p>While spreading a barrier, they perform healing.</p><br/><p>With just that, Chiya seemed like she was already unable to think properly. And seeing Shiki who was able to make more than two spells in the midsts of that dance of blades, she understood that he was abnormal.</p><br/><p>It was as if his \u2018body and spirit were moving as different entities\u2019. Transcendental movements that can even make someone feel bad.</p><br/><p>A superior dragon that is called the world\u2019s highest ranked.</p><br/><p>Hibiki and the others were simply looking at how that notion was crumbling.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

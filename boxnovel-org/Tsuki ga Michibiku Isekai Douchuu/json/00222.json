Sorry about that.</p><br/><p>Also, the patreon thief has not deleted his page, he simply changed the name. If the thief is reading this, remember, your patreon is easy to trace, no amount of name changing will help you escape that. (Though, I am dissapointed in patreon itself for not smiting him yet after all the reports\u2026)</p><br/><p>But leaving aside the distasteful talk, I want to thank all the people at my new patreon site! Thanks. The site is kind of lacking in content, but if anyone has any suggestions for the patreon site, please tell me.</p><br/><p>Once again, thanks for the support!</p><br/><p>I overdid it there, but I don\u2019t regret it.</p><br/><p>It is a phrase that is normally seen in newspapers and weekly magazines.</p><br/><p>But I didn\u2019t think that the day I thought this would be when I am in a parallel world.</p><br/><p>Now that I think back on the day Samal was summoned, there were other ways to deal with the situation that would have been more beneficial.</p><br/><p>Thinking about it in advantages and disadvantages, I chose a disadvantageous one.</p><br/><p>Samal returned to his original tool form, and is now in the laboratory of Shiki.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s the need to research a lot in order to be able to utilize the powers of that tool, and it will take time and personnel.</p><br/><p>In essence, I have thrown away my chance to obtain a fast way to return to Japan.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026But well\u2026\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Looking outside from within my work room, a monologue comes out from my mouth.</p><br/><p>As I thought, I don\u2019t regret it.</p><br/><p>If possible, I want to return to Japan. That\u2019s the truth.</p><br/><p>But if that means I will have to leave Asora and everyone, my answer is no. I haven\u2019t reached any conclusions with the Goddess.</p><br/><p>And to endure the insults thrown to my parents in order to return? That would be a no.</p><br/><p>I want to return home, but I am probably not that hurried about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, I am already learning the customs and the way of acting in this world. A shitty world huh\u2026\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Even so, there are comfortable places similar to Asora and Tsige.</p><br/><p>This room that was completely empty, is now decorated by a lot of things that the people of Asora gave me. I also received books recommended by Rembrandt-san and representative Zara, and also from my teacher colleagues. Right now, it even feels like this room is a bit cramped.</p><br/><p>Even if it\u2019s a world that\u2019s ruled by that Goddess, it doesn\u2019t mean I have to hate everything.</p><br/><p>As a whole\u2026I like about 5% of it.</p><br/><p>Not 50%, but 5%, so it doesn\u2019t change my opinion that I hate almost everything.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuh~. Now that I think about it, in Japan, it is almost the season for plums. When that passes, it will be the season for the cherry blossoms. I think cherry blossom viewing is an event that Tomoe would be happy about.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Rapum blossoms, plum blossoms, and then, cherry blossoms.</p><br/><p>When I was in Japan, I always went around every year in March.</p><br/><p>I think cherry blossom viewing is the main event in spring.</p><br/><p>But in the famous places for cherry blossoms, there\u2019s normally food carts lined up and it becomes more of a festival.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why, even if my sight remembers the fully bloomed cherry blossoms, in terms of my sense of smell, it wasn\u2019t the scent of cherry blossoms, but the floured food and skewered food as well as the scent of alcohol.</p><br/><p>Especially in holidays and in the night.</p><br/><p>Cherry blossom viewing huh.</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s cherry blossoms, there are in Asora as well.</p><br/><p>When I looked around, I could see that there were a lot of mountain cherries, Kawazu cherry blossoms, and morning cherries.</p><br/><p>I am used to seeing weeping cherries and Yoshino cherry trees. </p><br/><p>Things like fruits and vegetables that are clearly not the type that grow in the wild, are growing naturally in Asora, but regarding the cherry blossoms, I haven\u2019t seen if they are the horticulture type.</p><br/><p>The possibility is not zero. The one that has the highest worth in seeing is the Yoshino cherry tree, so it wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea to look for it.</p><br/><p>I personally would like to see the mountain cherries and the weeping cherries, but for a cherry blossom viewing event, it would be best if the ones we first see are the pink and fully blossomed ones.</p><br/><p>But it is not like we are growing any cherry blossoms for the sake of viewing.</p><br/><p>A place where we can appreciate the cherry blossoms and are growing in numbers huh.</p><br/><p>Is there one?</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s the mountains, I can ask the animals in the mountains if they know.</p><br/><p>Okay.</p><br/><p>The faster the better. Let\u2019s try looking now.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt would be nice if it\u2019s in a nice place in the mountains\u2026eh?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Asora has\u2026expanded.</p><br/><p>I haven\u2019t done anything.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s been many cases when Asora expands by reacting to my magic power.</p><br/><p>They happen mostly when I am sleeping.</p><br/><p>In that case, this time is because\u2026I defeated Samal?</p><br/><p>I did use quite a lot of magic power and I tried summoning the arms.</p><br/><p>I was a bit angered there, but\u2026in terms of magic power, there are a number of possibilities I can think of.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut this is a bit strange. I feel like the scale is pretty big.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>The expansion was bigger compared to the others.</p><br/><p>The land that we are using in Asora is comparable to how much land a base takes in the wasteland.</p><br/><p>In other words, most of the land here is not used.</p><br/><p>Even if the residents here have surpassed the thousands in total, there\u2019s also the races that live in the sea.</p><br/><p>This is just an approximate feeling, but the current vastness of Asora might be the same as the part of the Goddess\u2019 world that is currently known.</p><br/><p>But we don\u2019t even have a country. The most we have are two towns and a few villages.</p><br/><p>We totally have too much to manage.</p><br/><p>At first, it was as if we were creating a town in a miniature garden, and yet, by the time I noticed, the miniature garden had transformed into a savannah. That\u2019s how it felt.</p><br/><p>The expansion this time feels slightly different from before.</p><br/><p>I use [Sakai] and investigate the land that has expanded.</p><br/><p>The new land was obviously created at the edges of Asora, so I am looking at Asora as a whole.</p><br/><p>When [Sakai] is too wide, it is impossible to use it to check details.</p><br/><p>Right now, it is fine if I can tell if it\u2019s mountains, valleys, plains, lakes, or a sea.</p><br/><p>With my previous experiences as reference, it has probably expanded 100 kilometers in every direction.</p><br/><p>If that\u2019s the case, this is quite the large scale.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Hey, you are kidding, right?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>As soon as I began investigating, I found something unbelievable.</p><br/><p>I could tell my face had stiffened.</p><br/><p>Asora itself is an outrageous place, but as expected, this is something I can\u2019t believe immediately.</p><br/><p>In a sense, it was the same as when I learned about the sea, or maybe I am feeling even more surprise than that time.</p><br/><p>Ah, the same as with the sea\u2026</p><br/><p>That means\u2026</p><br/><p>One possibility came to mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cWaka!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Right at that moment, Tomoe rushed into my room without knocking.</p><br/><p>\u2026.From the window.</p><br/><p>Well, you wouldn\u2019t be able to knock if you enter from there huh.</p><br/><p>Anyways, there\u2019s no doubt she is incredibly agitated.</p><br/><p>\u201cTomoe, please enter properly from the entrance. This is bad for my heart.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cRunning through the corridors is a waste of time! Right now, Asora is\u2026right now it is\u2026!!\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cCalm down. I understand\u2026probably.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cW-Waka, why are you so calm?! This is of utmost importance you know?!\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cHow to say it, I was surprised, but someone who was even more agitated than me came to my room. Came in with a \u2018Bam\u2019 you see. Well, when the sea appeared, it was pretty surprising too.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>It is also because I have an idea of what\u2019s going on.</p><br/><p>Tomoe is agitated to the point that it is amusing.</p><br/><p>It is probably because she knows Asora the most, and since she knows a lot about space magic to begin with, she ended up like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen the sea appeared, I was at least able to narrowly understand! But this time, this is definitely impossible! If the formation of Asora is made possible by Waka and I, this is definitely impossible!!\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, you are right. Hey Tomoe, leaving aside if it\u2019s a phenomenon we can understand or not, you understand that there are times when Asora changes completely even without us being involved in it, right? Like the time with the sea.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cRegarding the miracle from that God of another world, well, yeah.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this time the same? He did say there would be more after all.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cWaka\u2026 but\u2026\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go investigate immediately. We shouldn\u2019t agitate ourselves thinking about the possibilities of what happened, and simply accept them as something that has already happened. You see, lately, I have been feeling that there are things in society that are just pointless to think about.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>In the first place, I feel like living your life thinking in probabilities and rationale would be tiring.</p><br/><p>In my case, the chances of me being transferred to another world has severals zeros lined up, and yet, here I am.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Is that an enlightenment?\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Tomoe seemed like she was impressed, and at the same time, seemed to be worried as well; she had a complicated expression as she looked at me seriously.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s definitely not the case.</p><br/><p>\u201cNope, it is an \u2018I don\u2019t care anymore\u2019. I have learned that a lot can happen in life. So I decided to give up and accept the unreasonable and irrational points. In a positive way, that is.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cTo give up\u2026 Giving up in a positive way is a splendid conduct. Fumu.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t question what you have comprehended, but, you are going to the investigation too, right Tomoe?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, I will accompany you. After all, in that place, there is\u2026\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cA manmade object after all.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cA manmade object.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>The voice of Tomoe and I overlapped.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6 </p><br/><p>In the end, aside from me and Tomoe, Mio and Shiki joined us in the investigation.</p><br/><p>All the followers.</p><br/><p>I was thinking about searching for cherry blossoms, but it has been substituted by a long journey of repeating teleportations for around 30 minutes.</p><br/><p>Because it was in a direction that has expanded and hasn\u2019t been explored, we matched the pace of Shiki who\u2019s the one that\u2019s the least skilled in teleportation, and it ended up taking 30 minutes.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no doubt that this is more like going out to a picnic for us, but for Shiki, it seemed to be pretty rough.</p><br/><p>Well, we have arrived close to the location and the manmade object is in sight, so taking into account his recovery, we walk towards the objective.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really are unskilled in teleportation as always-ja na.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Tomoe makes an amazed expression at Shiki who has a dead pale face as he walks and breathes roughly.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though we were teleporting so slowly, you still end up like this.\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Mio didn\u2019t make things easier for him.</p><br/><p>Not only that, she went and comboed him.</p><br/><p>The breathing of these two is still normal, and they don\u2019t seem like they are in any pain.</p><br/><p>I am also the same. Only Shiki is incredibly tired.</p><br/><p>Even when I am sending him magic power and accelerating his recovery, he still looks like he is in pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy apologies. It has been a while since I have done long distance teleportation repeatedly, so my negligence has gotten the better of me.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>Since the time Shiki grew able to go back and forth between Asora and the outside, he hasn\u2019t used long distance teleportation that much.</p><br/><p>He is using Asora as an intermediary to jump to a teleportation point.</p><br/><p>I am basically doing the same thing as him.</p><br/><p>Because that way is easier after all.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s also the fact that Shiki has not been that good at teleportation to begin with, and the moment he reached a level where he didn\u2019t feel any inconvenience, he didn\u2019t do much practice in long distance teleportation anymore.</p><br/><p>I asked if he could endow a power like that to the rings, but it seems like the power of the rings isn\u2019t something he created, but something that was already there. There are no rings that are blank, moreover, there\u2019s no rings with teleportation powers.</p><br/><p>The power of Shiki that is able to display a variety of abilities had an unexpected pitfall to it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf walking is rough, it is fine to take a rest for a bit, you know.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I am\u2026fine. I am receiving your magic power, so\u2026I will recover\u2026in time\u2026\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. This is just for reference but, just how tired are you feeling right now?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>He looks like he is in pain, and yet, his walking seemed to be fine, so I tried asking out of curiosity.</p><br/><p>Well, the eyes of Shiki are blazing with curiosity at the thing that we are heading to, so he will probably forgive me for asking this.</p><br/><p>Curiosity is greatness.</p><br/><p>Because even though we told Shiki that it was far, he was adamant in going.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor example\u2026I feel like, I have\u2026run for\u202630 minutes\u2026at full-throttle.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I see.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>You would die from that.</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t imagine doing a 30 minute run in full-throttle.</p><br/><p>In the first place, is space teleportation something that comes with physical exhaustion?</p><br/><p>My breathing has not been disarrayed in any of the instances I used teleportation though.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you boasting about your exhaustion to Waka? Are you an idiot?\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Mio. I was the one who asked.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo Waka-sama. We matched the pace of Shiki and moved slowly, and yet, the person himself is breathing roughly as he boasts? That\u2019s the very definition of an idiot-desu wa.\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Shiki is not even boasting to begin with.</p><br/><p>His breathing is simply disarrayed and the color of his face is bad, that\u2019s all.</p><br/><p>\u201cR-Right, now that I think about it, Mio, is there any sort of physical exhaustion when using the space teleportation spell? It is my first time hearing about that.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Changing the subject, I move the direction away from Shiki.</p><br/><p>\u201cEhm\u2026I have not really felt that. It is on the level that if used correctly, it is okay, I think?\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>You think?</p><br/><p>Mio uses magic in an instinctive manner, so it is hard to use her as a reference huh.</p><br/><p>At the very least, it seems like she hasn\u2019t felt much exhaustion.</p><br/><p>Also, in Mio\u2019s case, her stamina is overwhelming, so it makes it even harder to tell.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t go teaching something so half-baked to Waka. Waka, space teleportation magic normally consumes a fit amount of stamina and magic power depending on the distance. Teleporting to and from Asora is a different case though.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. I haven\u2019t really felt it.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh\u2026EEEH?!\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>Ah, Shiki is looking at me with a face full of despair.</p><br/><p>Your \u2018eh\u2019 is long.</p><br/><p>Oh, I kind of feel like he is drawn back.</p><br/><p>\u201cWaka has stamina to begin with, and you always have your crazy body strengthening activated, so there wouldn\u2019t be much point in taking others as reference.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cCrazy, you say.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cSadly, that\u2019s the reality. I don\u2019t think there will be a day when you teach space teleportation magic to others, but if that chance does come, I recommend you to first read some books regarding the subject so you can learn the common sense behind it.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I will. Thanks.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Why is it?</p><br/><p>I tried to do a follow-up for Shiki and change the subject, but now I am the one that ended up depressed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe teleport formations reduce the consumption of stamina and magic power, so it is in a range for practical use. \u2018Using it skilfull and it will be okay\u2019 like what Mio said is out of question, but it is possible to reduce the stamina consumption by enhancing your body.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, then Shiki can do just that.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cWaka, Shiki used 4 rings and still ended up like this. That Shiki.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Shiki didn\u2019t show any signs of responding to Tomoe\u2019s words and simply continued hanging down his head and walking dejectedly.</p><br/><p>Now that I look carefully, he does have the strengthening rings he uses for battle.</p><br/><p>Just when did he\u2026</p><br/><p>He actually went through all that and still felt like running at full-throttle for 30 minutes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, with this as a lesson, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s the deal with you not being good at teleportation, but you should train-ja na. What\u2019s the point of a follower if he ends up troubling his master-ja.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>No Tomoe, try saying those words right back at you a few times.</p><br/><p>Just a few days ago, you asked things like: \u2018Where is the Asuka metropolis?\u2019 and began asking questions of history and archeology that had no relation to samurais and had already surpassed the boundaries of what a high school student would know.</p><br/><p>Like hell I would know.</p><br/><p>I wanted to say: \u2018Isn\u2019t it somewhere in Nara?\u2019</p><br/><p>It seems like the old Nara had a lot of battles, so in that period, it wouldn\u2019t have been strange for several Asuka metropolis to have existed in those times of war.</p><br/><p>Just how far are you planning on turning back in the history of Japan?</p><br/><p>What a fearsome love for Edo.</p><br/><p>Even I haven\u2019t gone so back, and am not that knowledgable about it.</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s events before the Edo period, I probably have a bit more knowledge than normal.</p><br/><p>And yet, Tomoe had to get an interest in the troublesome minor warring eras.</p><br/><p>At those times, they used to set things on fire a lot, and the lost of historical documents was incredible. Meaning, it is most likely a period shrouded in darkness even for the Japanese.</p><br/><p>My knowledge is so small that it can be laughed at.</p><br/><p>\u201cWaka?\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cHm? Sorry, I was thinking.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, sorry for interrupting. Was it regarding that building there?\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Even with all that, Tomoe is always in a good mood.</p><br/><p>Especially after this manmade object suddenly appeared in Asora.</p><br/><p>There were several buildings.</p><br/><p>I have confirmed their appearance with my eyes already.</p><br/><p>I have also finished grasping the details of them with [Sakai].</p><br/><p>When I try to use magic power for perception, it feels as if that place is an empty space with nothing there.</p><br/><p>But when I look at it with the naked eye, or when I use [Sakai] to look at it, it is certainly there.</p><br/><p>There might be a special type of barrier placed in it.</p><br/><p>It is a place that wouldn\u2019t be strange if that were the case.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, there\u2019s that too.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cWaka-sama, is it okay-desu ka? It has been bothering since a while but, what is that?\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Mio points straight.</p><br/><p>What she is pointing at isn\u2019t the buildings that are several kilometers away.</p><br/><p>It was a \u2018gate\u2019 that I am used to seeing.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t think it is related to Samal though.</p><br/><p>It looks like a giant Shinto shrine archway.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no way I would mistake that shape, it is certainly a Shinto shrine archway.</p><br/><p>descarga</p><br/><p>From there, it leads to a forest path.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a Shinto shrine archway, Mio.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cArchway?\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cAs I suspected! That\u2019s an archway, Waka?! Wuuh, this is the first time I have seen the real deal-ja! Listen well Mio, that\u2019s a gate leading to the residence of a God. You can\u2019t cross right in the middle, got it? And after that, you\u2026\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Tomoe is excitedly telling Mio about a variety of manners.</p><br/><p>Mio made a face saying: \u2018I messed up\u2019, but it was already too late.</p><br/><p>She was splendidly caught by Tomoe.</p><br/><p>She was taught things like: the way to cross the archway, how to clean your hands, and the way to pay homage.</p><br/><p>For some reason, she even began explaining the methods that are not the common ones, like the Izumo Grand Shrine one.</p><br/><p>It is normally only 2 bows, 2 claps, 1 bow. With all that information, you will only make her confused.</p><br/><p>If you are going so far in explaining, rather than the 4 claps, it would be better to teach her the 8 claps method that works even in grand festivals.</p><br/><p>Most Japanese people know about it, but there\u2019s no way that Mio who lives in a parallel world would know, and even if she knows of it, I don\u2019t think she would be able to tell that there\u2019s a meaning behind it.</p><br/><p>When we arrive at the archway, let\u2019s teach Mio and Shiki the simple way of paying homage.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected, is there no doubt that it is what Waka-sama said?\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>I nod at Shiki who has finally recovered.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeems so. It is still far, but there being an archway must mean that there\u2019s a road to a shrine.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cRoad to a shrine?\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, sorry. Saying it in a simple manner\u2026\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>It doesn\u2019t seem like we will need to wait before the gate, so it should be fine to give them a rough explanation about it.</p><br/><p>If they want to learn in more detail about it, they can be the sacrifices of Tomoe- I mean, their students.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeaning that we will be entering the residence of someone with influence in the Shinto shrine. Well, just consider it a path leading to a temple in order to pray.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cTemple\u2026 So a Shinto shrine is really a building with that kind of objective. The image of Gods in Asora isn\u2019t that good though\u2026\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s exceptions, but just think of them as incredibly old temples. We will just have to look forward to what we will be seeing there. But I don\u2019t think there\u2019s the need to get so tense about it.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cAn old temple, I feel like those words in itself are already contradicting themselves though. An old temple is it.

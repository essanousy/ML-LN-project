She is not there.</p><br/><p>I search for Sari with my eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2026Oi.</p><br/><p>I found Sari who is now sprawled at the top of a tree branch for some reason. </p><br/><p>Ah, she is being brought down by the Lorelais.</p><br/><p>This place has a large variety of drinks after all.</p><br/><p>She probably drank a mix of things and got drunk.</p><br/><p>It seems like there are people nursing them, so there\u2019s no need for me to go.</p><br/><p>\u201cAn open and tolerant God, is it. It is certainly true that in Edo there were festivals at the Shinto shrines, and it had become a place where people gather and enjoy their time. It is a hard to comprehend part, but after doing it myself and seeing it with my own eyes, I am kind of beginning to understand.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Tomoe is with me.</p><br/><p>She is not the type that makes much of a racket. It seems she likes to do things in a calm manner.</p><br/><p>Well, a cherry blossom viewing is something like that.</p><br/><p>There are people that consider the cherry blossoms as a simple excuse to hang out, and there are people who truly enjoy looking at the cherry blossoms.</p><br/><p>There are people that consider the drinking as the priority, and there are also people that prefer to go through the many food carts.</p><br/><p>Sometimes people consider morning is better, some that night is.</p><br/><p>Even so, there\u2019s no need to fight over it.</p><br/><p>I think that people have different ways to enjoy things.</p><br/><p>You don\u2019t need to get in the way of the enjoyment of others and just enjoy it in your own way.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is not like the people of the past viewed their God lightly and made a racket, okay? As long as you possess the emotion of respect as the root, I don\u2019t think the actions that come naturally from it are strange.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s how I think.</p><br/><p>There are many unconventional festivals as well, but that doesn\u2019t mean we are looking down on the Gods.</p><br/><p>Being merry doesn\u2019t equal to insurrection.</p><br/><p>Of course, it is not only on the basis of respecting the Gods, and there\u2019s also the motivation that they will do their best on their next festival.</p><br/><p>All of those points together make me like the festivals and the events in the Shinto shrines.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why I am happy that I was able to enjoy cherry blossom viewing in Asora even if it\u2019s slightly different.</p><br/><p>If customary grand festivals and seasonal events are born, it would be great.</p><br/><p>It has already been decided that there will be a gate connecting this Shinto shrine from the land and the sea.</p><br/><p>This is something that I will definitely do.</p><br/><p>I want them to visit the shrine at ease, and even if it is a religion, I don\u2019t want them to get lost or have people die like in the Ise pilgrimage.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s someone managing the place, and since the place is so spacious, it can even be used to teach the children.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cIn my opinion, it doesn\u2019t need to turn into a learning place. I would be happy if it simply becomes one of the places where people can just enjoy their time.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Whatever the case, we have to be grateful for the Gods that have gifted us something nice.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Drinking her small cup of Sake, Tomoe looked satisfied.</p><br/><p>Her change of mood is kind of\u2026fast.</p><br/><p>With the matter of the shrine maiden-san, Tomoe seemed to be kind of snappy, but right now, there\u2019s no signs of that.</p><br/><p>Mio, who is mostly just by my side, was also like that, but right now, she is going around the various food carts and bringing me food.</p><br/><p>Even though I am not sure if I can finish the stacked boxes of food that we brought for the cherry blossom viewing.</p><br/><p>She really is merciless.</p><br/><p>I thought I had eaten quite a lot, and yet, I feel like the amount of food has increased, and I am pretty sure it is not just my imagination.</p><br/><p>I also feel like the stacked boxes of food are not matching the numbers of before\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, Mio is enjoying herself in her own way, so that\u2019s fine huh.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Looking at Mio who is easily slipping through the tumult of people and drunks, I give up on the choice of eating everything.</p><br/><p>I will just do my best to my utmost limit.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s for the best, probably.</p><br/><p>\u201cWaka-sama, regarding the magic power that is being taken when paying visits to the shrine, it seems like it isn\u2019t to the point of bringing any harm to someone\u2019s health.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cShiki, I told you that it is fine to take a break from work right now. In the first place, Touda told us that already.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, it seems like there\u2019s differences between people and considering that it is not a set amount, I thought it would be best to investigate just in case\u2026\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, yeah. Thanks, Shiki. For now, come drink and eat. Also, watching the many flowers that Touda has bloomed is kind of nice, you know?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Touda made the cherry blossoms bloom just like she said.</p><br/><p>There are many varieties of cherry blossoms, and there\u2019s also the ones that only bloom in summer and fall.</p><br/><p>In Japan, this spectacle can only be seen after growing them in a greenhouse and setting up the appropriate environment, and yet, this view is being spread in this grounds and in the forest.</p><br/><p>It is quite the sight.</p><br/><p>People that like this could probably be able to stay here for several days looking at it.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! I have a mountain of things to do like investigate the vegetation of this land and the environment of this forest.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cRejected. You will do cherry blossom viewing. Your work is done.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cB-But\u2026\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Shiki is working, other people might begin doing it as well. That\u2019s why, today is a holiday. You have done plenty enough with just the investigation regarding the shrine visiting.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Understood.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>Yup.</p><br/><p>Shiki has an addiction with work.</p><br/><p>I also have a lot of work that I have to prioritize over sleep, so I do understand his feelings though.</p><br/><p>In my case, as long as there\u2019s nothing real big, I will certainly be working everyday, but\u2026I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the same as being an addict to work.</p><br/><p>The words that Shiki says: \u2018I am okay\u2019 and \u2018I have free time\u2019, I am beginning to understand that taking those words of his in face value is dangerous.</p><br/><p>How to say it, this disposition of his is contagious or should I say, feathers of a bird flock together.</p><br/><p>The subordinates of Shiki and the people that are closely related to him have the same trait.</p><br/><p>Different from Tomoe and Mio, he was originally a hyuman, which is probably playing a big part in it.</p><br/><p>Mio and Tomoe seem to have found sleeping as pleasant, but it looks like Shiki was not the type who liked sleep to begin with.</p><br/><p>I remember him saying that when he became a Lich and was unable to sleep anymore, he was delighted.</p><br/><p>Sadly to say, even when he made a pact with me and obtained a hyuman body, for some reason, he still possesses that constitution of being okay even if he doesn\u2019t sleep -no, maybe it is more fitting to call it an ability.</p><br/><p>It does seem like his workplace is the same, so I would like him to be a bit moderate with that special constitution of his.</p><br/><p>For now, it looks like he is obediently doing cherry blossom viewing, but I am unsure if he will be able to hold for 30 minutes. It is Shiki after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cTouda, about the shrine visiting, I didn\u2019t ask the detailed parts like the differences between people and the issue that it isn\u2019t a fixed amount of magic power taken. There won\u2019t be any problems occurring with that, right?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>After that fight on the name of a custom, we returned to the Shinto shrine with Touda, and we heard from her about the three temples counting the Shinto shrine.</p><br/><p>From what she said, what I didn\u2019t know at all was about the part about the homage, worshipping, and praying; well, in other words, the parts that were done when praying in front of Gods.</p><br/><p>Saying it simply, just like when someone pays homage in a shrine with money, you also consume magic power here.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. Well, there are always exceptions in everything, but regarding the difference in individuals, it is simply to consume magic power that\u2019s fitting depending on the capacity of the person. For people that have ten thousand, a hundred is taken: for people that have a hundred, one is taken. That\u2019s how it would work. So it would mean, the people would be offering around 1% of their total in normal visits.\u201d (Touda)</p><br/><p>Touda was actively making contact with the residents.</p><br/><p>When called, she would immediately appear close and answer, which was slightly mysterious.</p><br/><p>The Orcs, Eldwas, Mist Lizards, Arkes, Winged-kin, Gorgons, and the fairies that are traumatized by Ema; it felt like she was going around introducing herself to everyone.</p><br/><p>Truly a business-like attitude.</p><br/><p>Thinking about her role here and in the Kuzunoha Company, I feel like she has the disposition for deployment.</p><br/><p>Just that, in my opinion, if I were to go head hunting for personnel, rather than people who are outstanding, I would prefer people that have reasonable skills and will be working together until the end.</p><br/><p>I have finally noticed that those are the requirements I am looking for.</p><br/><p>It is also because we haven\u2019t done the pact yet, but I feel like Touda is the former type.</p><br/><p>I feel some sort of stiffness in her that\u2019s hard to express in words.</p><br/><p>It doesn\u2019t only apply to her. I have felt this kind of thing a lot of times while in this world.</p><br/><p>In the companies of the Showa era, being diligent was more important than skill when looking for personnel, but it is probably an old way of thinking in this era.</p><br/><p>But leaving aside the seniority system, I am thinking about putting into practice the lifelong employments.</p><br/><p>An enterprise.</p><br/><p>Living that kind of lifestyle, we will do our very best and reward the employees for their service.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s what I want to do.</p><br/><p>Oops, my thoughts derailed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, people like me would be offering quite a lot.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. But it shouldn\u2019t feel like a burden at all.\u201d (Touda)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. The first time we did the homage, I didn\u2019t feel anything after all.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease do think of it as expendable magic power.\u201d (Touda)</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what was that about the fixed amount and the exception you were talking about?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe answer would be the same. When it is a strong wish -a wholehearted wish- like for example; wishing for it every day several times, or taking years continuously wishing for it. Depending on the case, it might affect your very life.\u201d (Touda)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen you make a wish so strong and wholeheartedly\u2026\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. If you wish strongly, you will end up offering a large amount of magic power. Thinking about the belief of the people of Asora towards this Shinto shrine, I don\u2019t think it will be possible.\u201d (Touda)</p><br/><p>Wish for it strongly, moreover, they have to do it continuously for that to happen huh.</p><br/><p>It is certainly true that this is a case that\u2019s hard to consider in Asora.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. It is true that there\u2019s currently no need to worry about it.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I taught everyone that when they pay homage, they have to tell the Gods of their current objective. Towards a God they can\u2019t see. </p><br/><p>I told them that it was like a pledge to yourself.</p><br/><p>Not the: \u2018please make it come true\u2019, but more like: \u2018I am working hard in this objective, so please watch as I show satisfactory results\u2019.</p><br/><p>When they show results, they will come again and give their gratitude, and make their next pledge.</p><br/><p>Also, I wanted them to have a different sensation of a God. Instead of that Goddess, it would be more like, a God that is close but you can\u2019t touch. That kind of relationship.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how I think as well. Shiki-san\u2019s worries are plausible, that\u2019s why, I told him it is fine if he investigate as much as he wanted though.\u201d (Touda)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe magic power that is being offered will gather in a vessel, right? Is it fine to assume that the balls that you showed us are the *divine vessels* where it resides?\u201d (Makoto) </p><br/><p>What Touda showed us as the divine vessels were two transparent clear balls and one ball that had a variety of colored lights inside it.</p><br/><p>The transparent ones are the ones from the Buddhist temple and the Parthenon, and the one with light inside is from the Shinto shrine.</p><br/><p>In other words, the light inside the ball is our magic power.</p><br/><p>I was slightly bothered that it was all in the same ball.</p><br/><p>Because the presence of those divine vessels should have differences between each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe divine vessels, is it. Hm, there\u2019s no problems with your interpretation, but strictly speaking, the vessels are more close to eggs. That ball will change its appearance as it accumulates magic power after all.\u201d (Touda)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Heh~.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>As expected of a unique Shinto shrine.</p><br/><p>So it is its form before being born.</p><br/><p>Well, that\u2019s fine.</p><br/><p>In the first place, having magic power sucked as you go paying homage is not normal anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026By the way, Makoto-sama, offering magic power when praying to Gods works the same way even in Earth. Actually, this world is the strange one for not taking this system.\u201d (Touda)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?!\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>She read my mind?!</p><br/><p>No, that\u2019s not it. It is a system that\u2019s used universally?!</p><br/><p>No way that\u2019s true!</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s way too farfetched. Even when I visited shrines in my world\u2026\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cMost humans are not aware of the very concept of magic power, so it is a matter of course. They don\u2019t use it, and they can\u2019t detect it. Even if they were to consume a small quantity of it, there won\u2019t be any harm for humans. It is an amount that wouldn\u2019t even need one day to recover after all.\u201d (Touda)</p><br/><p>Seriously?</p><br/><p>It is certainly true that I wasn\u2019t aware of my magic power when I was in Japan.</p><br/><p>So I have been offering magic power to the Gods every time I went to the shrine?</p><br/><p>No, at the temple as well huh.</p><br/><p>The church also?</p><br/><p>Ah, now that I think about it, I haven\u2019t attended church once.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor some reason, I feel like I have peeked at the dark side of the world.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cIn a faraway future when magic power is known in Earth, there\u2019s the chance that they will learn of this reality.\u201d (Touda)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Yeah.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut well, leaving aside that talk, regarding the divine vessel, I think it won\u2019t be long before it shows form. Just with Makoto-sama\u2019s magic power, it has already received an enormous amount after all. But when speaking of its completed form, it would still need a long time. I will report when there\u2019s some sort of change, so you can just enjoy yourselves.\u201d (Touda)</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, I will go back to the residents to talk about Makoto-sama.\u201d (Touda)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen the cherry blossom viewing is over, we will do the pact in the presence of Tomoe and the others. Remember that.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I am looking forward to the name I will be receiving.\u201d (Touda)</p><br/><p>Touda disappeared.</p><br/><p>Oh, she appeared where the Gorgons are.</p><br/><p>When it is with those people, talk about me just gives me a bad feeling though.</p><br/><p>Even so, it will probably turn into a girls talk, so I don\u2019t think I want to hear it at all.</p><br/><p>Talk between women is pretty toxic at times.</p><br/><p>I can say for sure that it is without doubt something that\u2019s best for men to not hear.</p><br/><p>Well, I have an older and younger sister, so in my own house, moreover, in my very room, I could hear fragments of those kind of talks.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why I know they are toxic.</p><br/><p>Touda has most likely adapted to the Gorgons without any problems and enjoying a conversation with them.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no need to worry about that, so I decide not to mind anymore.</p><br/><p>\u2026The party is going at full swing huh.</p><br/><p>Since coming here, I have gone to many countries and have met a variety of people, but as I thought, I like this place the best.</p><br/><p>Everyone has different shapes and appearances, so in a glance, it feels like chaos itself though.</p><br/><p>But I absolutely want to protect this place.</p><br/><p>Asora can be considered the very tracks of my stay in this parallel world.</p><br/><p>With that reason in mind, I felt like I had to burn this sight into my eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWaka-sama?\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cMio, we have enough food alrea\u2014wait, what\u2019s that?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>It is Shiki.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no way I would mistake him.</p><br/><p>But, why is Shiki under Mio\u2019s arm completely wasted?</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t say that. I went to the place of the Orcs, and I felt quite the possibilities in this \u2018Surprise foiled frying\u2019. I thought Waka-sama should definitely try it once.\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo Mio, I will gratefully eat that, but\u2026what happened to Shiki?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThis? He had equipment prepared and was doing a secret talk with a number of people about entering the forest, so I brought him down.\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cBrou\u2014\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though we are having a cherry blossom viewing, this person really has no manners. I was discussing with Tomoe-san and Touda about having festivals like this every now and then -of course, it won\u2019t be as grand as this one- and we were planning on what date they would be, and yet, this Shiki is just\u2026\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it is certainly true that it lacks manners. Yeah.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Bringing him down is also questionable though.</p><br/><p>Moreover, they are already talking about doing more of these festivals.</p><br/><p>At some point in time, Tomoe was where Touda and the Gorgons are.</p><br/><p>That must mean Mio was there not that long ago huh.</p><br/><p>And, Mio saw that Shiki was planning on going to the forest.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt would trouble the people if he were left on the ground, so I brought him here where there\u2019s space. I will throw him somewhere where people can\u2019t see.\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>You are throwing him?</p><br/><p>That means you are going to be throwing him at some random place, right?</p><br/><p>No wait, don\u2019t go throwing him.</p><br/><p>Abandoning him is also a no.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I will look after him. Let\u2019s have him lie down.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way, to have him rest on Waka-sama\u2019s lap is just\u2026!\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Who said I would have him rest on my lap?!</p><br/><p>I won\u2019t do that!</p><br/><p>That would only make it hard for me to move.</p><br/><p>I see. Mio must have drunk quite a lot already.</p><br/><p>I believe that she won\u2019t get controlled by the alcohol, but her self-control might loosen slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I will just have him rest.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I will take his place!\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>She is not listening at all.</p><br/><p>Well, this is also an everyday occurrence here, and a part of what I have done in this world.</p><br/><p>But the nice mood about my determination I had going a while ago has been dampened a bit though.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

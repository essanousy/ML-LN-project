Check it out:</p><br/><p>http://toriitranslations.animeholics.org/hyuman-the-truth-and-an-encounter-rinon/</p><br/><p>I will be leaving the links on the TOC, according to the chapters. Lots of thanks to the translator :D!</p><br/><p>Btw, this chapter was complicated and had a lot of terms I didn\u2019t know, that\u2019s why it took me longer. Coupled with exams, which will soon finish, I got a headache. By next week I will be returning to normal schedule.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst of all, I am the true Adventurer Guild master. Or more like, I was the one who founded it. A thousand years ago that is\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?!\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Root reveals the founding of the Adventurer Guild with a serious look. Tomoe and I show our surprise in our voice, but Mio seems to not be that interested, she doesn\u2019t show much reaction at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was taught the concept by an otherworldler just like Makoto-kun you see. Well, I had some plans of my own in it too, but I proposed the idea to the Goddess and became the one in charge. She thought of the guild as a system that would make hyumans stronger, a really simple way of thinking. She didn\u2019t reject the idea\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>Plans of his own. Those are words that interest me. Also, otherworldler. As expected, the heroes and I are not the first victims of that Goddess.</p><br/><p>If he says one thousand years ago, does that mean when Japan was in the Heian era? Could it be in the era of Fujiwara Michinaga? N? Something bothers me. What could it be?</p><br/><p>\u201cIn those days, I thought of the structure of the guild diligently. And the otherworldler that taught me the general concept, well, he was my first husband. I heard a lot of stories from him, and while having fun, we structured the system. Right, if we were to compare my mental state at that time, it would be like the one Tomoe is in currently. Anyways, learning about his concept, studying, and reproducing it, was so fun\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>Yeah, I agree. The case comes from a 3rd party, so I can strangely understand him.</p><br/><p>In short, just like how Tomoe was hooked into period drama, Root was hooked into creating the Adventurer Guild. And so his world widened, and in a sense, created a dangerous organization that\u2019s not affected by the influence of the country. When there\u2019s the Goddess and a superior dragon backing it up, the hyumans against it must have been minimal. After all, it\u2019s a Goddess.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe otherworldler who became my husband, in those days was a swordsman that was sung as a hero in Elysion. And I was his wife and companion. I was also able to get the Goddess\u2019 cooperation, so after creating the system, it permeated in the hyuman society incredibly fast. After that, by changing my appearance, I was able to become the Guild Master successively for several generations\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>The founder, and the current master huh. That\u2019s quite impressive.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe 1st generation master wasn\u2019t Root\u2019s husband?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Even though his husband sounds like he should be the one holding the leadership there. He didn\u2019t want to become the master?</p><br/><p>\u201cInstead of those things, he was more into women and alcohol. After achieving the name of hero, he didn\u2019t do anything resembling work. Well, being a hero itself has meaning as an idol, so in a society where the warring time passed, it is probably more convenient for him to not be doing anything\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u2018In peaceful times, there\u2019s no need for heroes\u2019 is what he is trying to say, maybe. Certainly, even in the history that I learned in my world, there\u2019s not much written of the heroes after their achievements in war. There should be information if you search for it, but there\u2019s some of those heroes that just pass it leisurely. Probably because heroes, who gather people\u2019s attention, would pose as hindrance for the powers that want to gain influence postwar.</p><br/><p>And it seems that Root had a pretty wild sexual drive since olden times. Looks like he doesn\u2019t think much of his husband having relationships with other women. N, maybe in those times they already had polygamy?</p><br/><p>I feel like he will be give me an out of tangent answer, so I refrain from questioning. Let\u2019s just hear what he has to say quietly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Adventurer Guild exists in the whole world and it serves as a place to solve people\u2019s problems. And it also provides the card that shows the level of the members and has several other functions, as well as many other benefits. And well, didn\u2019t you find it strange?\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cHm?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe guild card that surpasses the effectiveness of some magic tools, and the word level. These are concepts that come out from games in your world, aren\u2019t they? Then why is it that you were easily able to accept the existence of such an organization?\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cT-That is\u2026\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I certainly thought that this was a game-like world. But I experienced magic before that, and I heard the terminology level and class. I thought that was the preamble of this world. Now that I think about it, I accepted it because of a strange reason.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2019Because it\u2019s a parallel world\u2019, isn\u2019t that what you thought? That\u2019s why you were able to accept things that were totally out of norm, like multistoried wooden constructions. And that\u2019s why you accepted the word Adventurer Guild just by hearing it\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Yeah\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cWell it is true that for some reason, Makoto-kun and the other people that come from parallel worlds are able to accept the existence of an Adventurer Guild pretty easily. Even though in your world, it is obviously an organization that doesn\u2019t exist. I think that\u2019s pretty interesting\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u2018Yup yup\u2019, Root nods several times in an interested manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cI just can\u2019t understand it. From what I have heard, it seems that you used the otherworldlers information as a standard to create the guild, but you didn\u2019t show much interest in managing the guild, and it doesn\u2019t seem like you wanted to be an adventurer either. To create an organization like the Adventurer Guild just to kill time, I feel like it is a bit too intricate for that\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Tomoe cuts in. I see, now that she mentions it, Root didn\u2019t mention that he wanted the guild to be made this way, or that he wanted to become an adventurer. It is natural to think that the scale of things is a bit too far for a time killer.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo well, it was mostly for fun. A time killer. I\u2019m a monomaniac after all. Thinking about how to make the guild and trying each thing one by one, was truly worthwhile\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>His specs are uselessly high. A monomaniac that did it only to kill time, that\u2019s pretty impressive. I am jealous.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, you did say you had your own plans right? What was that-ja?\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cYour ears are sharp. I feel like Makoto-kun might hate me for it, so I don\u2019t really want to say it though\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>He was probably thinking about something pungent. In the first place, for a person that says he doesn\u2019t want to talk, your face is telling me that you are brimming with motivation to talk about it. He probably wants to see my reaction.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want to talk about it anyways, just say it at once. Also, don\u2019t look at Waka. You will dirty him\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Tomoe, isn\u2019t Root an ex-colleague of yours? No, a boss-like existence? And you are already treating him like dirt. That\u2019s nice, please continue doing so.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes yes. Well, it isn\u2019t a complicated story. Since a long time ago, the Goddess held the hyumans in favor. However, I valued the world. That\u2019s all there\u2019s to it\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t understand. Talk concisely. You have always liked talking in enigmatic ways. There\u2019s no need for that now-ja\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 It is an effective way that helps the other party get interested and urges their understanding though. Oh well, got it. Meaning, the Goddess\u2019 favor was so excessive that the hyumans would increase in numbers and grow prouder, and it was easy to predict that this would in time destroy the balance of the world. And that\u2019s why, to restrain this, this was one of the things I did. I said this before but, more than half of the reason was because of my hobby\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cA restrain for the increase of hyumans? But the guild urges the growth of hyumans right? Isn\u2019t it actually fostering it then?\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s called \u2018looking at the tree but missing the forest\u2019. Listen, you receive a card when you register at the guild. This card shows you your own level and rank, but it is essentially only a numerical value to denote your current situation. When you are indicated with a rank and numerical value, hyumans tend to aim for higher heights. As expected of people that have been based of humans, they are a race with strong greed\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Well, sorry for having strong greed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf your level increases, you will get stronger. Of course, even without knowing that number, by defeating mamonos and doing war, you will not see the number, but it will certainly show the changes. But just by making it a simple to understand number, their enthusiasm increases. And so I, for the sake of speeding up that enthusiasm, intervened in this world\u2019s system. Well, I only made it so that the power absorption they gain from others is increased though. In words that Makoto-kun would understand better, it is like increasing the experience gain\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>Seeing the numbers will make them more enthusiastic. I think that\u2019s true. I can\u2019t deny it. There are times when people don\u2019t continue to put in work because it is hard to see the improvement and that affects their spirit. But what Root did is like cheering for their growth. So where in that does it show any restrain effect?</p><br/><p>\u201cI see, so that\u2019s how it is. What a devious thing to do\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>But it seems that Tomoe understood what Root was trying to say. Is it the difference between humans and dragons, maybe?</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, there would be hyumans that get adhered to their level and rank. Levels show their own strength, and ranks would increase their benefits in the guild after all. And obviously, there would be adventurers that would spread their name by having a high level, and younglings that admire them and register in the guild. There were some that have become knights or kings and have thrived\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s a nice story. Work hard and succeed. I have also thought about increasing my rank aiming to get more functions from the card after all. My level doesn\u2019t show any signs of increasing, and after becoming a merchant, my heat has cooled down a bit though.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 You are honest huh, Makoto-kun. It makes me feel ashamed of my own shrewdness. You have the face of someone that says: hard work leading to success is a good thing\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that bad? Isn\u2019t that something anyone would think?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cFufu, let\u2019s continue. Having their enthusiasm for achievements overflowing, wishing for promotion, a stage where money is not completely necessary and you just need physical strength and magical power to begin; the amount of adventurers aiming for that dream-like situation increased. Become stronger, famous, richer. If there were no Adventurer Guild, kindly speaking, those kind of people would work as freelancers or become ruffians. Badly speaking, spare troops for rebels. They originally don\u2019t have much capital, so their existence was at the end of the ropes, that\u2019s why they interpreted the guild way too favorably\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut by enclosing a portion of the ruffians in the guild as adventurers, the ruffians that persevere in their bad doings won\u2019t be able to act as easily. That means it would be serving as a way to better public order, isn\u2019t it?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s something good. I can\u2019t see the conclusion of this.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s was probably that kind effect as well. There\u2019s nobles in the guild too after all. But what\u2019s important is that the hyumans that only look at the future, automatically thin out\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>Thin out? What does he mean? It sounds pretty dangerous though.</p><br/><p>\u201cExcess will destroy one\u2019s body. Ruffians, freelancers, dreaming younglings as well. Aiming for success, they become strong, and somewhere along the way, they miss their footing at a step. Levels, ranks, rewards; there are truly a lot of adventurers that have lost their lives in the requests of the guild. Even after a thousand years, there\u2019s not much of a difference. In those, there were some that had good luck or were uncommonly wise and were able to rise. Those are the successful ones. Their existence works as advertisement and calls more people in. For successful ones to be more than the failures is impossible in current society, so there\u2019s uncountable amount of corpses beneath the successful ones. Nicely speaking, the ruins of dreams\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, there are people who have excessive spirit and fail, but after some time people learn to balance that out. So is there really an effect like thinning them out? Cause well, the country is currently filled with hyumans, isn\u2019t it?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd, the number of adventurers in that equation is extremely low. There are many times when just one mistake leads to death. Taking into account the demons that have held hostility since beginning of times, there are now also demi-humans who are showing opposition. Its proof that the thinning out is showing its effect. After all, no matter how you put it, numbers are power. If there were no Adventurer Guild, the current world would probably be more peaceful. In exchange of everything else disappearing except the hyumans and the subordinated demi-humans though\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut to say that everyone goes mad with greed. Even they should know when to pull back\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe ones that are able to act in that way are the successful ones, Makoto-kun. Even if they are unable to become kings. Using the guild system in an efficient way and obtaining a reasonable income, that is already a good enough success. You are free to believe me or not, but misjudging by a little step is how hyumans are. In fact, there are many people registering as adventurers every day, and yet, the amount of adventurers in itself hasn\u2019t increased that much. If we take into account the time when the Goddess disappeared, it actually decreased. People that keep dreaming about the wasteland, labyrinths and quick cash, die in amusing ways\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>No way. To think that the Adventurer Guild that serves as support for the adventurers is actually a system that fans them in order to thin them out\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cJust, I don\u2019t want you to misunderstand. If everyone was as you said, knowing their own limits and modestly growing for the sake of their future, the guild would have contributed in that, and in a different sense, it might have served as a catalyst for a peaceful world. But in reality it didn\u2019t happen that way, moreover, not only hyumans, but also other races began joining as well. There were several things I didn\u2019t expect. Frankly speaking, the Adventurer Guild is an organization that supports the greed of people, for good or for bad. Fortunately, the problems of the hyuman society don\u2019t disappear and the requests never run out. The people that don\u2019t become adventurers and decide on going for a different path, when they see that there\u2019s danger in the objective they are trying to accomplish, there are times when they buy the result with money. And the Adventurer Guild accepts those requests. It is truly well made right? That they are thinning out just as planned was because the adventurers mistook the way of using the guild\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>It may be a bit different, but maybe it is because power is just power, it depends on the person itself to know how to use it. As a result, for the long time of one thousand years, adventurers were caught in the trap of Root and were drawn in just to burn.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I see. Interfering with the system of the world. Using the increase of adventurers as a whole to make a simple and irregular pact with the world huh. In short, the increase of growth begins to work after a while of becoming an adventurer\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cTomoe, your head has gotten better. That\u2019s right. I am versed in pacts after all. I tampered with it a bit. By the time they get used to it, their growth will probably accelerate as well. It also makes it easier for them to die, so that makes it even more amusing\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cIn short, increasing levels makes your base power rise right? Ability and experience, as well as talent, are not values that are taken into account in levels, is what you are trying to say. Tch, it feels vexing that I am losing to Mio, but if that\u2019s the truth of it, there\u2019s no real need to go through the trouble of raising it huh\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s how it is. It varies depending on the race as well, so it doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t beat them. It is only like a reward for the strong ones by the world after all. No matter if you are a saint or a villain, as long you are able to kill someone of your same capacity, you will be able to obtain strength equal to that. It is like the complete opposite of the Goddess\u2019 blessing, so it is better to not believe in it blindly. There\u2019s no merit in despairing with the words talent and instinct, so I introduced the levels and even brought in the job system, as well as the function limit of the card depending on rank. I really worked hard you know. Well, right now there\u2019s no one that has reached the highest level though. And so they are still dancing in my palms. By the way, the peak level is 65,535. My husband made a fervent speech about it being a man\u2019s romance or something like that, so I decided to put it that way\u201d (Root) </p><br/><p>Leaving aside if I actually believe everything, I have understood most of what Root is trying to do and say. Right now Tomoe seems to be using special terminologies and words of unknown meaning as she does arguments with him, but regarding that, I practically don\u2019t understand anything.</p><br/><p>If you are an adventurer that has self-control, that place will support you normally.</p><br/><p>If you go there filled with greed, as long as you don\u2019t have incredible luck or talent, it will be a trip straight to your grave.</p><br/><p>Or so it seems. Now that I think about it, the wasteland was exactly that kind of place. Just by arriving there, you are without a doubt the latter type of people though.</p><br/><p>But well, now that he points that out, it is truly that way. This world gives the feeling that the Adventurer Guild already fits in, and in truth, it has continued existing for a thousand years. It is older than some countries. I don\u2019t think there are mediation offices or enterprises that exist in Japan since the Heian Era, so I can imagine just how powerful is the Adventurer Guild. A multistory building in a wooden construction huh. It really is strange.</p><br/><p>For example, the Merchant Guild\u2019s information relay is being improved daily, but it doesn\u2019t reach the level of the Adventurer Guild at all. I remember I read about a merchant that saw the Adventurer Guild and thought of making a cooperating organization and that\u2019s how the Merchant Guild was created. It certainly does feel that the Merchant Guild which has been influenced by the country, towns and powers, actually \u201cfeels like\u201d it\u2019s an organization created by hyumans.</p><br/><p>The Adventurer\u2019s Guild abnormal speed in information relay is enough to make me doubt if there actually existed mailing system in this world. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that the wasteland\u2019s Adventurer Guild is a sub-branch, the existence of Tomoe and Mio could have spread through the world in a matter of days. In Tsige, Rembrandt-san helped by moving some strings in the shadow. His wife and daughters were in a precarious situation at that time, and yet he did all that. I really can\u2019t find words to express my gratitude. After that, even the Adventurer Guild saw the achievements of Tomoe and Mio who accomplished the requests of the wasteland with no problems, and how important those two were, so they have helped in order for the information to not leak to the outside. Well, the dragon in front of us probably knows clearly about Tomoe and Mio as well as my level though. Seriously, he talks nonchalantly about information of my world. Just how many otherworldlers has he met?</p><br/><p>\u2026 N?</p><br/><p>AAAAhhhh!!</p><br/><p>This is it!! This is what has been bothering!!</p><br/><p>\u201cRoot!\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cN, what is it Makoto-kun? Feel like making a pact with me? I\u2019m so happy\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cWrong! About your first husband! You said it was a thousand years ago right?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I did say so. And what about it?\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did a human from so long ago know about Adventurer Guilds?! Not only games, there weren\u2019t even stories written with such settings!\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I was even thinking about Heian Era and Fujiwara Michinaga, and yet, why is it that I wasn\u2019t able to notice that point?!</p><br/><p>\u201cFumu, so you were bothered by that huh. It is fine to explain to you, but thinking about it in an Urashima Tarou-like way would be easier\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cLike what? It is a pretty important matter for me, so please give me the details!\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cRoot, Waka is asking you. If it is fine to explain, then do so from the beginning\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Maybe, just maybe, one of the probabilities that I have been thinking of will disappear. This is a critical moment. Telling me to think in an Urashima-like way and be happy with such an explanation, there\u2019s no way I can accept it!</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. If you go so far as to say that\u2026 Tomoe, you also asked me, so please bring out something like a blackboard. You know right, a blackboard\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t take me for a fool. The point is you need something like a board for explaining and writing tools right? Wait for a bit\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cCounting on you. Doesn\u2019t matter who, at least one of you please listen to me till the end okay? If both of you drop out, I will attack Makoto-kun (in a sexual meaning) got it? It\u2019s a promise okay?\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>What a scary thing to say. But to belittle those two\u2026 In our side we have the instinct type genius Mio-san\u2026</p><br/><p>She fricking went to sleep. No wonder she didn\u2019t say anything. Looking at Mio pleasantly sleeping, I sigh.</p><br/><p>One person has already dropped out huh.</p><br/><p>This is the worst. There shouldn\u2019t be a problem with Tomoe who was talking complicated stuff. Shiki might also come back anytime soon.</p><br/><p>While waiting for Tomoe, Root praised the tea and fruits as we exchanged idle talk. I waited for what he has to say about the time inconsistency.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

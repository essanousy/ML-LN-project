With the end of the extras drawing closer, it would be better if we were to get that new story before that after all.</p><br/><p>The adventurers that are affiliated with the Adventurer Guild are in essence always under the risk of dying.</p><br/><p>But when they leave a settlement to do their job, it is not as if they are always in a battle with their life at the edge all the time. Lowering their guards and being arrogant are not options, and the requests have their own rank with their respective difficulties.</p><br/><p>Of course, they won\u2019t always continuously take jobs that are close to their abilities.</p><br/><p>In other words, even the adventurers in Tsige that require the best of abilities have jobs that fall into the category of \u2018you can get money\u2019 and \u2018are easy\u2019. Even in the wasteland that is bounds and leaps different in level from other places, it was no exception.</p><br/><p>One of those is the forest that one can see as soon as they leave Tsige and enter the wasteland.</p><br/><p>Some level of security has been secured in the path towards the forest, and the distance is not that big of a deal.</p><br/><p>As of now, there hasn\u2019t been any reports of specially dangerous monsters in the way to the forest. Because the wasteland is incredibly vast, no one has reached the deepest parts of it yet, but just with this, you could even call that place an oasis in the wasteland. But it doesn\u2019t stop to only that. That forest even has a number of valuable plants and trees.</p><br/><p>You can train there, serves as a gauge of your strength, on top of that, you can get income from it.</p><br/><p>Many adventurers head to this forest, and it goes without saying that they endeavour in their job and training.</p><br/><p>Of course, it is now a famous place where wasteland beginners and intermediate ones gather.</p><br/><p>And so, the forest is named Tinarack Forest coming from the most popular material gathered there, the Tinarack grass.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s currently a situation happening at that place.</p><br/><p>The adventurers heading to the Tinarack Forest are not returning.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s not really any problem if a beginner party were to be wiped out on their way to the forest.</p><br/><p>People would only brush it off as \u2018they overestimated themselves\u2019 and there wouldn\u2019t be a shred of pity for them.</p><br/><p>That they didn\u2019t have the required ability yet to enter the wasteland.</p><br/><p>But when even an intermediate class party that had the objective of getting money there had all not returned, the story changes.</p><br/><p>Even the Adventurer Guild went \u2018huh?\u2019.</p><br/><p>On top of that, if seven days continue without any Tinarack Forest requests being completed, there\u2019s already a clear abnormal situation.</p><br/><p>The guild formed an investigation team with scholars and skilled fighters that wouldn\u2019t mess up even by mistake and they had them head to the forest. They are divided in bodyguards and investigation team, but there\u2019s three specialized mages and alchemists in total, and three adventurers specially good in battle</p><br/><p>It is true that it was hurriedly formed, but even with that, the three combat specialized ones are all within the top 10 of Tsige, and the scholars have also been acknowledged in battle and research.</p><br/><p>In the guild\u2019s eyes, they thought they had sent out a completely foolproof team.</p><br/><p>\u201cWeaklingthieves got so arrogant they lowered their guards, what a joke~. Are they sane by acting separately?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWeakling-thieves?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is the word I came up with with my high naming sense. It is unexpectedly nice, you know. To shorten it, it would be weakling. Or thieves?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEris, the combination is gone\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Ah, right.\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>A small shadow was having a tensionless conversation as she stepped on a fallen adventurer.</p><br/><p>The person she was talking to is tall compared to her and she was also kicking the fallen scholar without mercy.</p><br/><p>His body was sent flying in a manner unbelievable of a hyuman body, and he stops after hitting a specially big tree.</p><br/><p>Looking properly, there were two others there who had lost consciousness.</p><br/><p>It is the deed of these two demi-humans.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, looks like the last two have noticed us. They seem to be a cut above the rest of these thieves.\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s apparently a hyuman town called Tsige not far from here. It is the base of the adventurers. That must mean they have noticed the strange situation in this forest they have been doing whatever they want in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018That\u2019s why strong adventurers have come\u2019, is what the tall one deduced.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really gets me, you know~. Doing whatever they want to the forest we prepared. Do they know how much trouble it was to make it grow this much? Do they think this big of a forest appeared miraculously?\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, hyumans just know about stealing. They are the favorite children of the Goddess after all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhaha~. In that case, we are the farmers? Like, growing the trees and plants for the sake of the hyuman-samas? Are their brains made of flowers and cherries or something?\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026It is because our ancestors didn\u2019t like that that they ended up isolating themselves in such a remote place. I don\u2019t know what the elves are thinking by coexisting with them, but I think we are far apart.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUmu umu. Akua\u2019s straightlaced self is the same as always. Hm?\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Eris?\u201d (Akua)</p><br/><p>Letting out a fake-looking \u2018hoh~\u2019, the demi-human Eris looks at a certain direction of the forest.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe remaining two have a decent decision-making ability.\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>\u201c?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are planning on prioritizing the report of the situation rather than saving their comrades.\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026How troublesome.\u201d (Akua)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo no, I think that\u2019s actually a great decision\u2026.. If their opponents weren\u2019t us, and if this wasn\u2019t our forest, that is.\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, that\u2019s right. I will be dealing with the one that moves well. Eris, you go for\u2026\u201d (Akua)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe mage or scholar-looking one, right? Understood.\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>With a bold smile, Akua holds her bow in hand and runs through the forest without looking back at Eris.</p><br/><p>Eris, on the other hand, began chanting the aria of a spell like a song, and with her short staff, she twirls it around as if playing with it and returns it to her waist, and then, links both of her hands at the back of her head and began to walk.</p><br/><p>By the time the baton twirling moves of hers were over, her aria had already finished.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood grief. It had been a while since we returned to harvest the things, and what do we find? Adventurers are truly the type that pop out from wherever. What a real pain.\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>Eris walks for a while in the forest while mumbling.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. The forest Tsige calls as Tinarack Forest is actually a forest that the race of theirs had cultivated for a long time. Its vegetation was something that had been planned beforehand.</p><br/><p>Looking at it from Akua and Eris\u2019 perspective, hyumans are simply noxious insects that have stepped into their fields and are stealing their crops as they wish.</p><br/><p>When the comparison of them being the farmers and the hyumans being the noxious insects was established, the relationship between them was decided.</p><br/><p>A relationship where elimination is the ideal solution.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s all there is to it.</p><br/><p>\u201cMost of them were weaklings, but they were sly, and there were some that were actually pretty strong. Once you see one, there\u2019s more crawling around. It is a real pain. Do you understand that? Wait, there\u2019s no way you would.\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>Eris stops her feet and looks up.</p><br/><p>There was a single man there caught on the branches of a tree that were extending in a strange manner.</p><br/><p>A hyuman man.</p><br/><p>The spell that she had done while twirling her staff and chanting an aria had already caught him.</p><br/><p>There were no other presences in the area, and it looks like the companion that was with him had prioritized escaping the forest.</p><br/><p>The caught man was pathetically resisting.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you guys\u2026you guys are the abnormalities that have been lurking in the Tinarack Forest!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTinarack Forest? \u2026Hah\u2026it really saps my strength. Truly a pain~.\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>\u201c?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the first place, there\u2019s no abnormality here. You guys are the noxious insects here. This place is a medicinal plant garden that we Forest Onis have been managing since forever. It is one of our gardens.\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u2026A child? Forest Oni?\u201d</p><br/><p>Maybe because he is in a situation where it is despairingly low that he can be released from his bindings, the hyuman scholar questioned the demi-human.</p><br/><p>But her appearance and her answer to his question were all unexpected, so the man had fallen into slight confusion.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I have lived several times longer than you. Oh well, who cares. You must be an alchemist, scholar, or a brewer. There\u2019s something I want to ask.\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>\u201cU-Uh? I am a scholar that specializes in the plants for magic drugs. Name\u2019s Ab Turner.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask for your name. And so, the Tsige adventurers are calling this place Tinarack Forest?\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn other words, it is connected to the tinarack flax -no, the tinarack grass that grows lushly right in this forest?\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, well, this Tinarack Forest is not limited to that, it also has other valuable plants, so there must be even more valuable plants deeper inside, but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The answer of the man made Eris sigh heavily.</p><br/><p>She was clearly showing disappointment.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeaning that, for you guys, this place is a miraculous forest that conveniently has a big amount of valuable plants sleeping in it? Plant scholar, Turner-kun?\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>Eris shows a half-smile with droopy eyes as she looked at the scholar that was still caught in the plants.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe thought it was the miracle of the Goddess. We saw it as one of the treasures sleeping in the wasteland.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd this is supposed to be a scholar. Truly irreparable.\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>Eris mutters and shrugs her shoulders with a \u2018good grief\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, you seem to be someone we can communicate with, so can you please release me? There might be a misunderstanding here. But once we talk it out, we could reach an understanding and find a point of compromise.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChi chi chi, even if you tell me that while secretly forming an aria in ancient language, it doesn\u2019t have any sort of persuasion.\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>\u201c?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way, the very fact that a forest exists inside the messed up climate of the wasteland is already a miracle. Leaving aside the fact that it is in a spot where the climate is stable.\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>\u201cWa?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think there\u2019s such a convenient situation where a forest this grown with so much vegetation and variety of plants are coexisting and many of them are valuable medicinal plants and fruits can exist?\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>\u201cT-That\u2019s\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way in hell. Our ancestors poured their hearts and souls to cultivate this forest, and yet, you enter as if you own the place, and stole as you pleased.\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>For a moment, the eyes of Eris showed a cold and sharp anger as it pierced through the man.</p><br/><p>It was truly only an instant. Soon after, it returned to the droopy and listless eyes, but the man felt shivers that he hadn\u2019t tasted before.</p><br/><p>\u201cI-It is a misunderstanding. In the first place, we didn\u2019t know this forest was owned by someone!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMust be~. Because you guys don\u2019t even know at all for what this forest is being a garden for.\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>\u201c?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Deep in here, we are cultivating crimson flowers. This is a garden that has everything prepared to protect it. Well, there\u2019s no one within us Forest Onis that go by \u2018ignorance means innocence\u2019. I will have you pay for your sin.\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>\u201cCrimson flower? No, wait. Wait, please! Pay for my sin?! Don\u2019t tell me, you plan on killing me?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ab Turner had reacted sensitively to the \u2018pay for your sins\u2019 that Eris has spoken a little after he had sent shivers down his spine.</p><br/><p>Rather than the plant that he has no recollection of but was definitely a valuable plant, he was more worried of his own fate.</p><br/><p>90% of the missing people are dead. This reaction was a natural one.</p><br/><p>\u201cKill? No way. If you had touched the crimson flowers, then I would have killed a number of you guys, but\u2026I wouldn\u2019t mindlessly kill the Hyuman-samas.\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are not going to kill me? But I did hear that a lot of people have gone missing\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFortunately, you haven\u2019t touched the important things, and also, you did what you did without knowing. Yeah yeah, there\u2019s room for mercy. Most of the intruders until now have not \u2018died\u2019, you know?\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?! Is that true?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Eris speaks with clear hidden meanings, but the man had no leeway to calmly notice that.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am not a hyuman, so I don\u2019t lie unless it is necessary. I am simply having everyone help in the work of us Forest Onis.\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, manual labor huh. You guys are more intelligent than I thought.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Yeah, you will be a part of the forest for a while. And so, I will have you sleep for a bit. By the time you wake up, you will be at the location.\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>\u201c? N, this is a\u2026sleeping\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Turner fell asleep, and his bindings came undone.</p><br/><p>But Eris didn\u2019t catch his falling body and simply watched as his body fell on the ground and made a dull sound.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Forest Oni children know more about the forest than you do, self-proclaimed scholar. This is a nice chance, so learn about the forest with that body of yours.\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>The small Forest Oni twirls her small staff.</p><br/><p>When she did that, the grass stretched like vines and wrapped the body of the man.</p><br/><p>\u201cOoh, you were already done too, Eris.\u201d (Akua)</p><br/><p>Eris reacts to the voice coming from her right, and there was Akua there.</p><br/><p>She had no injuries as she carried the adventurer on her right shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Akua, how barbaric. You turned him into a complete beehive. Is he even alive?\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is. There would be no point if he weren\u2019t after all.\u201d (Akua)</p><br/><p>Akua shook the man that had received heavy piercing damage, and he groaned slightly.</p><br/><p>It was close to a reflexive reaction. His consciousness hasn\u2019t returned.</p><br/><p>But it was clear that he had been defeated in a harsh manner.</p><br/><p>Just in what way was he pierced with so many arrows.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. It is fine as long as they are alive. Then, let\u2019s return. There was a high number this time around, so let\u2019s have the standby team help out.\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, Shishou will be incredibly happy. We gotta have them work for the amount that the adventurers have devastated after all.\u201d (Akua)</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly~.\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>The two brown skinned girls that called themselves Forest Onis disappear inside the forest as if melting with it.</p><br/><p>The disappearance incident of the Tinarack Forest continued.</p><br/><p>The guild\u2019s investigation team had fallen victim as well, and it continued to silently devour the adventurers.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Risa?! What are you saying all of a sudden?!\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>Yuno had escaped from the house, but that made the security around Sif, who was thinking about doing the same, even tighter.</p><br/><p>In other words, Sif couldn\u2019t escape from the house.</p><br/><p>While serving tea to her smiling father, she ended up having an afternoon tea time with her Mother Risa at the garden.</p><br/><p>She was secretly cursing Yuno as she had no choice but to pass the time with her family.</p><br/><p>Different from her little sister Yuno, Sif had quickly found the path she would take, so she was planning on doing her best in training at Tsige so that she wouldn\u2019t lack behind on her other comrades.</p><br/><p>Sif is stuck in terms of technique rather than the fighting style, so it was a different worry from her little sister.</p><br/><p>Simply speaking, there was not enough time.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why Sif was quite persistent with Raidou in regards to staying in Rotsgard.</p><br/><p>The time it took to reach Tsige and the time it would take to return to Rotsgard was precious for her after all.</p><br/><p>And within all this, the words that her Mother Risa told her had surprised her.</p><br/><p>Ringa.</p><br/><p>It is the first base that you will find in the wasteland after leaving Tsige.</p><br/><p>It is on a several days distance from the town. For the adventurers that are seriously exploring, this is the first objective to reach.</p><br/><p>Sif doesn\u2019t even have the level to leave to the wasteland, so it is a place she should have no relation to.</p><br/><p>\u201cM-Mother? I am not at a level where I can go to the wasteland yet\u2026\u201d (Sif)</p><br/><p>Of course, Sif was also surprised, though not to the extent of her father.</p><br/><p>\u201cAra, who said anything about going there as an adventurer? This is dangerous. You are beginning to resemble Yuno.\u201d (Risa)</p><br/><p>When her daughter spoke about level, her mother lets out a sigh.</p><br/><p>She mentioned her other daughter, who had left the house the very moment she returned.</p><br/><p>But well, different from her father that would become useless whenever it comes to his daughters, the Mother Risa understood plenty well the nature of her daughters.</p><br/><p>She had secretly made Morris tail Yuno.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, what do you mean by that?\u201d (Sif)</p><br/><p>\u201cA small job has come regarding your father\u2019s work. It is a simple job though, but you were born in the wasteland, so you should experience work as well. Use teleportation and\u2014\u201d (Risa)</p><br/><p>\u201cRisa, there\u2019s no need to make her go to the wasteland! Like\u2026right, how about sending her on an errand to the town of Koran or Kaido?\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201cDear, I told you that there was no need for our daughters to return even if it were just for one summer break, and yet, you went as far as using Raidou-sama to forcefully have them come back here. If we don\u2019t return them with some experience, we will be laughed at. Isn\u2019t that right, Sif?\u201d (Risa)</p><br/><p>She was smiling. Risa\u2019s eyes were smiling, but there was not a single shred of kindness in them and it was a smile with quite the pressure.</p><br/><p>The father and daughter that were complaining shut their mouth reflexively.</p><br/><p>The fact that the father had forcefully made his daughters come back by using underhanded means, and that his daughters were in a foul mood; his wife was in the know of all this.</p><br/><p>A while of silence.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you understand? It is a simple job of going to Ringa and confirming the luggage that has arrived there. If it is you, there\u2019s no need to worry. I will send the list later, so confirm it then.\u201d (Risa)</p><br/><p>\u201cR-Risa\u2026\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2018Let the cute girls go on journeys\u2019, was it? Those were some nice words there, Dear.\u201d (Risa)</p><br/><p>\u201cUuuh.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>The attitude of Risa that didn\u2019t allow complains had the representative of a big company shut up.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow then, go prepare, Sif. You will be heading out early morning.\u201d (Risa)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, yes, Mother.\u201d (Sif)</p><br/><p>Sif knows plenty well that her angry mother is the scariest in the family, so she had no choice but to nod.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cDear, be a bit more resolute. If you showed half of the face you show at work, I wouldn\u2019t have to take this role, you know?\u201d (Risa)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026when I look at Sif and Yuno, uhm\u2026I simply end up like that.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201cRaidou-sama is also relying on that other side of you.\u201d (Risa)</p><br/><p>\u201cI will do my best. I\u2026plan on fixing that.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Hah\u2026\u201d (Risa)</p><br/><p>Her husband that would act without openings in work is exceedingly soft on his daughters to a helpless level.</p><br/><p>Risa considers this to have already surpassed the realm of overprotective.</p><br/><p>But if she were asked whether her husband who aims straightforwardly for status and money or this one is better, she would be troubled in deciding.</p><br/><p>Risa considers his excessive parts as a charm of his as well, but it does bring headaches to her sometimes.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Heading to the teleport formation that\u2019s at the outside of Tsige without entering the wasteland; it sounds like a riddle, but it is actually pretty simple.</p><br/><p>Utilizing the narrow path that leads from the town to the wasteland, Tsige profits from the gate that divides those two areas.</p><br/><p>They simply gouged out a part of the wall of rock there and created a passage that leads from the gate to the teleport formation.</p><br/><p>As a result, a clearly smaller building compared to the gate was at the wall rock of the wasteland.</p><br/><p>But the costs for its maintenance and security are not that different from the gate.</p><br/><p>As the pioneering of the wasteland advances, people other than adventurers entering the wasteland will prove necessary, and this place had been created for that purpose.</p><br/><p>It is a place that was created by bringing the technique of the Limia Kingdom that is the most advanced in teleportation magic out of the hyumans.</p><br/><p>Traversing the passage that doesn\u2019t reach the 1 km in distance as she received permission to cross several times as she went by, Sif reached an incredibly showy teleport formation she had never seen before. She had once again been reminded that the security in this place was incredibly high for the wasteland and that it is also a place that is treated as a luxury.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no problem with the documents.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think I would have the honor of seeing Sif-ojosama personally. Is you father doing well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is doing well to the point that it is tiring for me. Also, father has told me to relay you the message that he will be counting on you for the remaining of the journey of today and tomorrow here.\u201d (Sif)</p><br/><p>\u201cOh! So we will be having a two day break?! I will certainly tell the others about this. This was a pretty rushed trip, so it really helps out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sif was at the Ringa base.</p><br/><p>She was walking around the several carriages with list in hand, making her look like she is doing work.</p><br/><p>Sif had finished confirming the contents of the goods and, after finishing her talk with the one in charge, she told him the message of her father and gave him some money.</p><br/><p>The one in charge took the money that was given to him for the sake of making a party for everyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cHah\u2026 I am so tired. Just thinking this is one of the bases makes me nervous.\u201d (Sif)</p><br/><p>She looks around the base she has never been to before.</p><br/><p>If she were to take one step outside this place, she would be in the wasteland where there\u2019s mamonos and demi-humans she can\u2019t match, which made her unable to relax.</p><br/><p>Sif makes a bitter smile at this undispellable tension she feels in this place that she has always been taught is a special environment.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Oi~! Could you be Sif-ojosan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Someone calls out to her while she was brooding.</p><br/><p>When she saw the two familiar hyumans that were approaching her while one was waving his hand, she felt a different kind of tension she hadn\u2019t felt for a while.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026Lime Latte?! And you are the adventurer\u2026Toa-san, if I remember correctly.\u201d (Sif)</p><br/><p>\u201cWe meet at an unusual place-su ne.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201cI am happy to hear that the daughter of the big Rembrandt family remembers my name. Nice to meet you, I am Toa.\u201d (Toa)</p><br/><p>\u201cI will of course know the name of the ace adventurer of Tsige. I know of Lime-san due to other reasons though\u2026\u201d (Sif)</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout that matter, I have already properly apologized to you and your father though. Wouldn\u2019t it be fine to get along better with me?\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t joke\u2026 No, my brain does understand. Just that, it is still difficult to be normal around you. Please do understand this.\u201d (Sif)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Well, I am indeed at fault here after all. Can\u2019t be helped. I will wait. So, what business do you have at a base?\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>Lime didn\u2019t pursue Sif\u2019s words and changed the topic.</p><br/><p>He does feel guilty about the matter of the cursed disease hurting those girls.</p><br/><p>He apologized to their father and it could be said that the matter had already been given a close, but he does not think that everything has been forgiven.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am helping out with the work of my father. I am simply checking goods though\u2026\u201d (Sif)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! The job we took since it was on the way, now that I think about it, it was from the Rembrandt Company.\u201d (Toa)</p><br/><p>\u201cToa-san\u2019s group was the one doing the guarding. No wonder the arrival ended up only taking a few days. If it is such a close area like this, Toa-san\u2019s group wouldn\u2019t even break a sweat.\u201d (Sif)</p><br/><p>Sif was slightly in admiration seeing these two that were standing in this base as if it had the same atmosphere as Tsige and praised that strength of theirs.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>But Lime and Toa gave a vague smile at the words of Sif and stayed silent.</p><br/><p>The deeper you go in the wasteland, the more dangerous it is. There\u2019s no mistaking that.</p><br/><p>But in reality, even if it is at the close areas, the danger is still plenty.</p><br/><p>Sif\u2019s words were the words of someone ignorant of the way the wasteland works.</p><br/><p>But it is questionable whether she will be stepping into the wasteland as an adventurer in the future, so the two decided on letting that misunderstanding pass by without touching on it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks to you guys, I was able to provide two days of break. Thank you very much.\u201d (Sif)</p><br/><p>\u201cAcha, the two extra days are a break now huh. Then that means we will be bidding farewell since we will be leaving here tomorrow.\u201d (Toa)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, is that so\u2026 Can you please wait for a bit more? I will talk with the person in charge about this, if possible, I would like some of your time to have a discussion\u2026\u201d (Sif)</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. Then I will go and have a talk about this with him, so lady, since you have come all the way here, how about you check the place? Well then, Lime-san, I will be taking my leave.\u201d (Toa)</p><br/><p>\u201cRoger. See ya later.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>Toa stopped Sif from going and quickly passed by her.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is being quick on acting and being skilled a trait of adventurers?\u2019, is what Sif thought as she saw her leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cLime Latte, what are you doing here?\u201d (Sif)</p><br/><p>\u201cMe? Work, obviously. Today is mainly information gathering. Tomorrow I will be taking separate ways from Toa and will be heading to Saki.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are going to the wasteland on your own?!\u201d (Sif)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it will be with the Kuzunoha Company, so it will be three counting me. Ah, right. If I remember correctly, Ojo-san, you use Spirit magic, right?\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What about it?\u201d (Sif)</p><br/><p>Sif gave out thorny words.</p><br/><p>It is because that\u2019s exactly the topic that she is been troubled by due to being unable to do enough training.</p><br/><p>Being suddenly thrown this topic by Lime, she couldn\u2019t not feel as if he were taunting her.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s quite a lot of people at the bases that you don\u2019t see in Tsige. For example, in this Ringa, there\u2019s a user of similar spells like yours Ojo-san, even though it is of a slightly different element.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201cSimilar to mine?\u201d (Sif)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. A user of both Spirit magic and regular one. I was shown it once, but that person used an unusual method like mixing\u2026or was it fusion?\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201c?!\u201d </p><br/><p>The words of Lime gave Sif a shock.</p><br/><p>Because what he said at the latter part was exactly the type of mage that Sif is aiming to be.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Do you want to meet that person?\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>The words Lime said after leaving a slight space of time were words he said because he caught on the internal thoughts of Sif.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Someone you know?\u201d (Sif)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, a bit. But that person is from the demon race. If you don\u2019t mind that, I can guide you there.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201cDemon\u2026 That\u2019s\u2026\u201d (Sif)</p><br/><p>Hearing the word \u2018demon race\u2019, Sif brooded over it.</p><br/><p>Hyumans and demons are in the middle of war.</p><br/><p>Even if it is a base in the wasteland and a place where the boundaries of races is thin, she still held a certain degree of opposition to it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is not a person that holds hostility towards hyumans. In the wasteland, races don\u2019t hold much meaning after all. For good or for bad, this is a place where we don\u2019t pry on each other. Well, just think of that person as an eccentric within the demon race.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I want to try meeting that person.\u201d (Sif)</p><br/><p>After a while of silence, Sif answered Lime.</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it. Are you fine with going now?\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d (Sif)</p><br/><p>Lime told her to follow him and begins to walk with his back facing her.</p><br/><p>Sif obediently follows him.</p><br/><p>Since being involved with the Kuzunoha Company, her way of thinking towards other races that are not hyuman has changed quite a lot.</p><br/><p>If it were before the time she was under the curse disease, she wouldn\u2019t have met a demon even if it was necessary.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Lime was scratching his head with a wry smile as he guides Sif.</p><br/><p>He is aware that he is being soft with Sif.</p><br/><p>But he can\u2019t help but feel guilty towards the Rembrandt sisters and their mother, so his words end up reflecting that guilt and he simply ends up wanting to give them a hand.</p><br/><p>It is because he wants to repent for what he did, but it is also because he likes to look after others.</p><br/><p>Lime was thoroughly tired of his own softness.</p><br/><p>\u201cOi, Risui, are you alive?\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>Lime stops in front of a certain house.</p><br/><p>Having a personal house in a base is, in a sense, proof that the person has decent strength, so that casual tone of Lime was not normal.</p><br/><p>\u201cCalling someone without honorifics\u2026 Ah, so it was you, Lime. I don\u2019t really need anything right now, you know? It also isn\u2019t payday yet\u2026 Hm? Who is that girl?\u201d (Risui)</p><br/><p>The one who opened the door was a woman that was slightly past her prime and felt as if her face was soon to show wrinkles.</p><br/><p>Just as Lime said, she had a horn growing from her forehead and had the characteristic blue skin.</p><br/><p>While fixing her glasses with her hand, she was looking at the visitors with a listless disposition.</p><br/><p>\u201cToday I came for a matter aside of the company. You probably don\u2019t know the company but, this lady here is from the Rembrandt Company in Tsige, Sif Rembrandt.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t take me for a fool. I also know about the Rembrandt Company. I am surprised by the fact that you know each other though.\u201d (Risui)</p><br/><p>\u201cNice to meet you, my name is Sif Rembrandt.\u201d (Sif)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah yeah. I am Risui. So? What\u2019s the meaning of this, Lime?\u201d (Risui)</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, this girl uses the same dual Spirit magic and regular magic as\u2014\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201cRisui-san! Please teach me compound Spirit and regular magic!\u201d (Sif)</p><br/><p>Unable to wait for Lime to finish, Sif asked straight.</p><br/><p>It was a tone as if she were cornered; a tone she rarely shows.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026And there you have it. I also request this of you.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is your specialty to bring in unusual people here, I see. It is not on the level of that Waka-sama you brought before though.\u201d (Risui)</p><br/><p>Being suddenly asked a favour, Risui made a dumbfounded expression for a second, but she soon began to complain to Lime.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is as you see. I beg of you.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>Surprisingly, Lime lowered his head deeply.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease stop it. Seriously, you do this even when you somewhat could anticipate I can\u2019t refuse. If in several days there\u2019s nothing worth mentioning, I will kick her back. Is that okay?\u201d (Risui)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t mind. Also, this girl will definitely become big.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201cGood grief. Prepare yourself for the next task. I will be ordering a lot of troublesome things to get all at once. Uhm, your name was Sif, right? Come in.\u201d (Risui)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, yes.\u201d (Sif)</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, do your best, Ojo-san.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201cI will at least say thanks.\u201d (Sif)</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>After watching over Sif entering the house of Risui, Lime leaves the place himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is the one that is the most bothered by it, you say? That would be me. Because you know, even if it didn\u2019t go as discussed, it is the truth that I did something terrible to them, so it can\u2019t be helped\u2026\u2026 Now then, I heard that Sif-ojosan was stuck with the matter of compounding Spirit magic and regular magic, but with this, it should be fine now. In that case, the next one is Yuno-ojosan huh. I think it would be best to find her a close-quarters weapon that might serve as her core, but\u2026the issue is the lack of a lead. Fuh\u2026I was told this by Boss as well but, aren\u2019t I one step away from being a stalker? Let\u2019s be careful.\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>Lime was keeping tabs regarding the situation of the Rembrandt sisters and had a rough understanding of what they were bothered about.</p><br/><p>Even if it is due to his sense of guilt, it was still conscientious of him.</p><br/><p>If there was interest as a member of the opposite gender in those actions of his, it would be legit stalkerish, but right now, that\u2019s not the case.</p><br/><p>Lime disappears into the hustle and bustle of the base as he grumbles.</p><br/><p>Even if it was made possible by Lime, Sif Rembrandt had met a mage in Ringa who uses the same kind of magic as her.</p><br/><p>Just like Yuno who had seen the physical techniques of Morris; these encounters were revolutionary for the two sisters.</p><br/><p>Sif and Yuno were beginning to stop cursing the fact that they couldn\u2019t stay in Rotsgard and were seeing it positively, looking forward to the time when they meet their friends so they can surprise them.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, this meant that the time their father had with his daughters was shaved off and it led to him suffering, and Morris, who was left with the task of shouldering this, was caught between a rock and a hard place as he also suffered as well, but compared to the joy of seeing how the two sisters were growing in such a dazzling manner, this suffering was trifling.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The city has caught its breath and begun to move forward.</p><br/><p>The town\u2019s structure is different from that of earth, of Japan.</p><br/><p>The biggest cause of that difference is probably magic, though.</p><br/><p>Removing rubble, recycling materials, constructing buildings and making roads.</p><br/><p>It was proceeding at a rate that makes Earth\u2019s modern construction techniques pale in comparison.</p><br/><p>Freely using the mages of the academy and seeing their work with my own eyes, it was truly amazing.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s so fast that I can\u2019t even be surprised with the speed at which the city in Asora was built anymore.</p><br/><p>In fact, considering that the Eldwas were leading the craftsmen, now I can see that they weren\u2019t just being humble when they said they worked slowly because they were being thorough.</p><br/><p>\u300cSorry for keeping you waiting, here\u2019s your large-portion lunch.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThanks.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>For a \u201clarge portion\u201d, it\u2019s not very much, huh.</p><br/><p>As I try to form an impression of the meal that I ordered, I look out the window.</p><br/><p>This is a new store within five minutes\u2019 walk from the Kuzunoha company\u2019s store.</p><br/><p>It was a first for me, but the Kuzunoha company decided to try expanding to the suburbs with a new store.</p><br/><p>In the place where we wanted to set up a temporary store, the people from the neighborhood who originally owned shops here closed them and moved somewhere else, so their land became available to purchase.</p><br/><p>After I discussed it with Shiki, I bought all of the land.</p><br/><p>In the end, the company\u2019s location moved only a very small distance, dubiously close to the academy.</p><br/><p>The store is wider than before, and by hiring part-time workers, we\u2019re proceeding smoothly with the new store\u2019s opening.</p><br/><p>At midday, on days when the special lecturers of the academy aren\u2019t needed, I can come here and eat lunch like this without having to go far.</p><br/><p>Just because Ruria isn\u2019t here anymore doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019ve lost our nabe*, so as usual, Shiki goes to Gotetsu often.</p><br/><p>TLN*: Hot pot (food dish)</p><br/><p>\u300cI guess this is something like a caf\u00e9. It\u2019s not really suitable to eat at, even if it\u2019s good for having conversations with people.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>They don\u2019t even give you a lot of food.</p><br/><p>Mio definitely wouldn\u2019t be satisfied with this place.</p><br/><p>She\u2019s not the type who likes stores that only have a nice atmosphere.</p><br/><p>As expected, a lot of the customers are young people who have just started as students.</p><br/><p>There are quite a lot of people like this at our own store, too, huh.</p><br/><p>I guess it\u2019s because we stock up on rare fruits.</p><br/><p>And for the students of Rotsgard academy, where it\u2019s not uncommon to be injured while training their practical skills, it\u2019s good to always have all kinds of medicine and ointments ready when needed.</p><br/><p>There are also quite a few who come to our store with their eyes set on our part-time workers, Jin and Amelia.</p><br/><p>\u300cEither way. The store does fine without me there.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>I\u2019m a little lonely.</p><br/><p>Aqua and Eris have been becoming reliable lately. They\u2019ve set up a system where there are no problems, even if I\u2019m not there.</p><br/><p>Though that\u2019s what I was aiming for.</p><br/><p>Ever since the school festival, I\u2019ve been receiving requests from all over the place and have been busy going here and there.</p><br/><p>At this rate, I\u2019m going to have my hands full with with the visits to Limia and Gritonia that I\u2019m being urged to go on and my interview with the Demon Lord. Root said something about wanting me to do something if I\u2019m planning to go somewhere far away as well.</p><br/><p>\u300cHaah, I wasn\u2019t able to buy the Kuzunoha Fruits Set today, either.\u300d(Male 1)</p><br/><p>\u300cTrying to get those is like a lottery that\u2019s drawn before the store even opens. It\u2019s just a matter of luck.\u300d(Male 2)</p><br/><p>\u300cI wish we knew someone who has connections there.\u300d(Male 1)</p><br/><p>\u300cI heard the normal employees don\u2019t even give special treatment, you know? If you got a part-time job there you might be able to secure some for yourself to eat, but they\u2019re not recruiting right now. The higher-up person is called Shiki and the store owner is called Raidou, I think? You might have a chance if you know those people.\u300d(Male 2)</p><br/><p>\u300cI don\u2019t have any contacts, and it\u2019s not like I want to eat it myself, I\u2019ve been asked to get it by my girlfriend. If you really want to eat it that bad, you should go line up for it yourself, jeez.\u300d(Male 1)</p><br/><p>\u300c... Could it be that you\u2019ve never eaten it before?\u300d(Male 2)</p><br/><p>\u300cNo. It\u2019s just fruit, right? I\u2019d rather have one of those weapons they sell.\u300d(Male 1)</p><br/><p>\u300cEh, it\u2019s amazing, you know? I definitely recommend that you try it at least once.\u300d(Male 2)</p><br/><p>They\u2019re talking about our store.</p><br/><p>I look at the two who are discussing the Kuzunoha company, being careful not to be noticed.</p><br/><p>Academy students?</p><br/><p>They\u2019re in plain clothes, so I can\u2019t tell.</p><br/><p>They\u2019re two young people, around my age.</p><br/><p>Fruit, huh.</p><br/><p>As usual, our quantity-limited cut fruits are being treated as rare items.</p><br/><p>When I get back, I\u2019ll ask about increasing our stocks on those.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat, you\u2019ve eaten it before? There are a lot of people who say that it\u2019s not worth the price, you know?\u300d(Male 1)</p><br/><p>\u300cThose are either people who\u2019ve never tried it, or those who have no interest in food at all. It\u2019s so good that if I could eat it once a week, I wouldn\u2019t need any other sweet food for the rest of the week.\u300d(Male 2)</p><br/><p>\u300cTo think that you\u2019d say that when you eat the desserts at a caf\u00e9 once every two days. Are those yellow ring things cookies or something?\u300d(Male 1)</p><br/><p>He\u2019s talking about pineapples.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s fun to gouge out their centers, so I\u2019ve gone to help them with it a few times.</p><br/><p>The ones from Asora don\u2019t sting the tongue even if you have a lot of them, so they\u2019re easy to eat.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhether it\u2019s medicine, food or weapons, the Kuzunoha company does something different from the rest. Whether it\u2019s the level or the quality of the items themselves.\u300d(Male 2)</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ll agree with you there. And, most of all.\u300d(Male 1)</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300cTheir employees are nice.\u300d\u300d(Both males)</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah.\u300d(Male 1)</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah.\u300d(Male 2)</p><br/><p>When the way we treat our customers is praised, I feel happy, as if I\u2019ve been praised myself.</p><br/><p>When they begged me to let them work for me, I made sure to teach both Jin and Amelia how to treat customers properly.</p><br/><p>It seems they\u2019re putting that into practice properly.</p><br/><p>The forest ogres and dwarves are treating the customers nicely, too.</p><br/><p>Though when it comes to people they know or regular customers, I\u2019m worried about Eris.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou know her?! Hey, when it comes to Kuzunoha\u2019s welcoming girls, there\u2019s only that person, right?!\u300d(Male 1)</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah, I was confused at first. But I\u2019d love to make that person my lover.\u300d(Male 2)</p><br/><p>\u300cShe\u2019s reliable and thorough when it comes to her work, so she\u2019s got herself together.\u300d(Male 1)</p><br/><p>\u300cShe\u2019s cute, gentle and kind. Other girls should learn a thing or two from her, seriously.\u300d(Male 2)</p><br/><p>Even so, they\u2019re talking about lovers?</p><br/><p>Thinking such rude things about our employees.</p><br/><p>They\u2019re talking about girls, so... Probably Amelia.</p><br/><p>That girl, she seems to look only at Shiki, but she\u2019s still popular among the customers, huh.</p><br/><p>Wait, \u201creliable and thorough when it comes to her work\u201d?</p><br/><p>On top of that, \u201ccute, gentle and kind\u201d?</p><br/><p>Is she a girl who would deserve this level of praise?</p><br/><p>\u300cShe\u2019s just like a princess, huh.\u300d(Male 1)</p><br/><p>\u300cShe\u2019s a princess.\u300d(Male 2)</p><br/><p>\u300cAqua-san is the best.\u300d(Male 1)</p><br/><p>\u300cEris-san is the best.\u300d(Male 2)</p><br/><p>\u300cBuh!\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>Guah, my sour juice went down the wrong way!</p><br/><p>It hurts, it really hurts!</p><br/><p>What a surprise attack this is!</p><br/><p>As I unconsciously spit out my drink, I get some strange, pitiful looks.</p><br/><p>I can only keep my head down in shame.</p><br/><p>Aqua?</p><br/><p>Eris?!</p><br/><p>Do these guys have rotten brains or something?!</p><br/><p>\u300cAh?\u300d(Male 1)</p><br/><p>\u300cHuh?\u300d(Male 2)</p><br/><p>They\u2019re not talking to me.</p><br/><p>They\u2019re questioning each other, because they both said different names.</p><br/><p>I want to put in a word of my own, but I need to recover from my unfortunate incident first and regain my composure.</p><br/><p>Aqua might be reliable and thorough when it comes to her work, but she\u2019s rather businesslike towards the customers.</p><br/><p>Eris is small so she might appear cute, but no matter how you look at it, she\u2019s definitely not gentle or kind.</p><br/><p>Or so I think.</p><br/><p>No, the thing is, they\u2019re hyumans and they want to make a demi-human their lover?</p><br/><p>Either the Kuzunoha company has really founds its place in the city among the students, or young people are more flexible in their way of thinking.</p><br/><p>Could it be that they were brainwashed when they were rescued by Aqua and Eris during the mutant rebellion?</p><br/><p>\u300cHey hey, if we\u2019re talking about the welcoming girls*, then it\u2019s got to be Aqua-san. Eris-san is not bad either, but her charm only exists because of Aqua-san, you know?\u300d(Male 1)</p><br/><p>TLN*: The term here is \u201c/kanban-musume\u201d. The dictionary definition of this term is \u201cpretty girl who attracts customers to come inside a shop\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat are you saying, the way that Eris-san accurately judges our moods and what we want makes her the ultimate welcoming girl, right? Use some common sense. It\u2019s a little hard for Aqua-san to compare to someone like that, don\u2019t you think?\u300d(Male 2)</p><br/><p>They\u2019ve started acting like JK\u2019s.</p><br/><p>JK\u2019s that aren\u2019t female high-school students.</p><br/><p>TLN: \u201cJK\u201d is a slang-term that stands for \u201c/joshi-kousei\u201d, which means \u201cfemale high-school student\u201d</p><br/><p>Things have clearly heated up compared to when they were discussing our products.</p><br/><p>Wow, they\u2019re standing up now.</p><br/><p>Surely they\u2019re not planning to have a fistfight over this stupid argument, are they?!</p><br/><p>Should I stop them?</p><br/><p>No, I get the feeling that things wouldn\u2019t be settled even if I stepped in, so I don\u2019t want to get involved... It would be more adult-like to leave them be. Yes.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey!\u300d(Girl 1)</p><br/><p>Oh, someone\u2019s come in to stop them.</p><br/><p>What a hero.</p><br/><p>I will secretly support you, girls.</p><br/><p>\u300cW-what do you want?\u300d(Male 1)</p><br/><p>\u300cThe best welcoming girl of the Kuzunoha company is definitely Shiki-san, isn\u2019t it?!\u300d(Girl 1)</p><br/><p>\u300cWait, you! Isn\u2019t it Lime-san?!\u300d(Girl 2)</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll add this store to the list of places I should never visit.</p><br/><p>\u300cHuh?! We\u2019re talking about welcoming girls! Who the hell wants to talk about freaking guys?!\u300d(Male 2)</p><br/><p>\u300cIf you just think about it, there\u2019s no difference between guys and girls! The male employees there are really handsome, gentle and kind! They\u2019re the best!\u300d(Girl 1)</p><br/><p>I guess I\u2019ll go back.</p><br/><p>I stand up, quickly pay and head for the exit.</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t say that I have any interest in the outcome of this debate among these people who seem to be our core fans.</p><br/><p>In fact, I\u2019m slightly regretting that I even began to listen to this conversation in the first place.</p><br/><p>What are they doing at the window seats?</p><br/><p>It seems that even the employee, who has been carefully observing with a smile, has decided that something needs to be done. In the corner of my eye, I see him moving towards the windows.</p><br/><p>This kind of fame might be problematic for us.</p><br/><p>The bright light of the sunny street is dazzling.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou there.\u300d(Mystery person)</p><br/><p>Hmm, me?</p><br/><p>Someone has called out to me, so I stop.</p><br/><p>\u300cExcuse me, but I heard that there\u2019s a store called the Kuzunoha company near here...\u300d (Mystery person)</p><br/><p>Oh, it\u2019s a customer looking for our store.</p><br/><p>\u300cIn that case, if you go along this street \u2013\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>As I turn towards the person who called out to me to give them directions, I freeze.</p><br/><p>\u300c... You, it can\u2019t be.\u300d(Mystery person)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s my line.</p><br/><p>What are the chances of this.</p><br/><p>\u300c...\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>I\u2019ve been hypothesizing many different ways this could happen, but I never imagined we\u2019d meet like this; words won\u2019t even come out.</p><br/><p>Either this is the result of the star that I was born under, or I\u2019ve somehow been drawn to Senpai.</p><br/><p>\u300cIf I recall, your name was Misumi-kun?\u300d(Mystery person)</p><br/><p>She knows my name?</p><br/><p>Even though our relationship was that of mere acquaintances who only exchanged words a few times.</p><br/><p>No, for Otonashi-senpai, it\u2019s possible.</p><br/><p>She\u2019s a person with no visible flaws, inside or outside.</p><br/><p>To the point you\u2019d wonder, \u201chumans like this exist?\u201d</p><br/><p>Really, why is Senpai in this world?</p><br/><p>\u300c... Otonashi-senpai.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>The hero\u2019s party left Limia heading for the Lorel Union with a strict transfer schedule to follow. They didn\u2019t have any plans to come to academy city.</p><br/><p>But now, the hero of Limia is right in front of my eyes, asking for the location of the Kuzunoha company.</p><br/><p>Otonashi Hibiki-senpai.</p><br/><p>I get the impression that she\u2019s a little sharper than she was when I met her while she was the student council president.</p><br/><p>Seeing Senpai here, whispering her name is the only reaction I\u2019m capable of.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

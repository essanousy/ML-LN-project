They were all already at the brim with his charm power. They didn\u2019t oppose at all the fact that they were being treated as objects.</p><br/><p>I heard from Tomoki that their levels were decent.</p><br/><p>Even if I recently learned that their class was actually assassin, there was one thing I could tell, after looking at those eyes, I knew\u2026\u2026it was already too late.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why I eliminated them.</p><br/><p>There were a number of people there aside from me, and leaving aside the moves they showed at the initial stage, looking at the sharp movements those three showed when they attacked me, they might have become a threat to Shougetsu-san and his group.</p><br/><p>Even now, I still think that it was the correct choice to quickly kill them.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s what I think, but\u2026who would have known that one of those girls was a close friend of someone at the lower floors here.</p><br/><p>That really got me, and it is problematic.</p><br/><p>In other words, the first impression the mercenary group has towards me is the worst.</p><br/><p>\u201cMust be. I heard you crushed her head?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Did I? If I remember correctly, I snapped the neck of one\u2026ah, I did crush the head of one too. The last one, I flashily opened holes in her chest.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t remember that well, but it was probably like that.</p><br/><p>I restrained them with my Magic Armor and popped both of them, then finished it with Brid.</p><br/><p>Yeah, that\u2019s right.</p><br/><p>Relying on the memories I recalled, I respond to the question of Rokuya-san.</p><br/><p>Now that I think about it, thanks to being used to this kind of things already, I have become able to respond to this kind of conversations even when I am in the middle of a meal.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were attacked by a group of high leveled Shadowless, so I don\u2019t think your way of handling the situation was to be blamed though. But that part, it seems like the concerned party is\u2026unable to accept it. Fumu, it\u2019s been awhile since I have eaten such good food. Where did you get it?\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>Rokuya-san covers for my actions.</p><br/><p>In this matter, I think anyone with the perspective of an adventurer would be able to understand me.</p><br/><p>The person killed was a close friend, and on top of that, she went through the pains of separating that friend of hers from her companions and drag her all the way to get treatment, but in a second of negligence, that friend managed to escape, and right after, this incident happened.</p><br/><p>It is not like I don\u2019t understand her for not wanting to accept it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m grateful to hear that. Ah, today\u2019s bento was made by us at the kitchen of the hotel, Rokuya-san.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a handmade of the Kuzunoha huh\u2026\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>Rokuya-san suddenly fell silent and looks at the others beside me.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so, who was it specifically?\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>He asks me with a smile.</p><br/><p>Looks like he liked it.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no person aside from the residents of Asora that have tasted the menu of Japanese-styled food made with things like soy sauce and dashi. </p><br/><p>That\u2019s why I was a bit uneasy, but it seems it was an unnecessary.</p><br/><p>Because of the Wise of Lorel, the Japanese culture is thicker here than in other countries, and yet, for some reason, the food is drowned in chinese style.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s a seasoning here that\u2019s similar to soy sauce, but if I had to talk about it, I would say they are not the same.</p><br/><p>In those points, Asora\u2019s ability to replicate is high.</p><br/><p>This is not preferential view, I really think that\u2019s how it is.</p><br/><p>\u201cMost of it was done by Mio. Shii also helped out well.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cHoh, Mio-dono. Excuse me for a bit.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>Rokuya-san who was at my left side, moves to the right side where Mio was sitting, and when he places his face at around her shoulder, he suddenly began smelling her.</p><br/><p>I could tell his nose was twitching.</p><br/><p>\u201cTruly a nice smell. Nostalgic even.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>On the other hand, the emotionless face of Mio instantly changed into an absolute zero smile and was going to stand up.</p><br/><p>I hurriedly place a hand on her shoulder and stopped her.</p><br/><p>With a bit of strength, I had her sit back.</p><br/><p>It would be another issue if it were in a conversation, but violence in the middle of a meal would be troublesome.</p><br/><p>\u201cRokuya-san, what are you doing so suddenly?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I ask his intentions.</p><br/><p>It is not like he suddenly wants a wife that\u2019s good at cooking.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo well, it was such splendid dashi, I ended doing this unintentionally. Just as I thought, you are an excellent cook. You have that characteristic fragrance of many ingredients which good cooks possess. Truly splendid.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201cFragrance, is it.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Did Mio have that kind of scent?</p><br/><p>Sadly to say, I didn\u2019t sense that much.</p><br/><p>But calling it fragrance piques my interest. Must be a nice scent.</p><br/><p>Yeah.</p><br/><p>\u201cAra. Leaving aside that you are a rude fellow, it seems like you are a knowledgeable one. If that was an action to confirm my cooking skills, I can turn a blind eye once.\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>The anger of Mio was extinguished in an instant.</p><br/><p>Maybe because there haven\u2019t been much chances for her cooking to be praised by people from the outside.</p><br/><p>And in truth, her skills have increased quite a lot, and if she were to be blessed by chances to show them out, the number of times she will be praised in this way will most likely increase.</p><br/><p>At any rate, she looks happy.</p><br/><p>It felt like, the moment she lets her guard down, her expression would loosen.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I was impolite there. I am relieved that you have forgiven me. So Raidou-kun prefers it slightly strong, instead of kombu, you are more of the katsuobushi type huh. Having someone like her who would cook the things you like. You are truly a lucky man.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>Rokuya-san directed those incredibly kind eyes, he sometimes shows, towards me.</p><br/><p>He was saying this while looking straight at me.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s true, but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I am truly grateful.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Now that I think about it, Rokuya-san called himself an assassin.</p><br/><p>He greeted us with something dangerous like a bladed weapon last night, and yet, why is it that he gives such a calming feeling?</p><br/><p>Is it a trait of people that have surpassed their occupation?</p><br/><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have anyone in our comrades that\u2019s main job is cooking, you see. We do make our own food with individual quirks, but the basics are really important after all\u2026\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It is probably a topic that I shouldn\u2019t touch much.</p><br/><p>In cooking, basics should come before individual quirks.</p><br/><p>If not, terrifying things might occur.</p><br/><p>It is like in Nabes .</p><br/><p>Nabe is delicious, sweet things are delicious, cream is delicious; even so, that doesn\u2019t mean combining the three of them will make it better.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s not how it works.</p><br/><p>That is in no way an improvement.</p><br/><p>\u201cOops, let\u2019s put my matters aside for now. Anyways, sad to say but, the girl that had her close friend killed by you -her name\u2019s Pione by the way-she is planning on having revenge on you. And so, the designer of this labyrinth, the Marikosan, and on top of that, the Picnic Rosegarden members from all sides are gathering in order to mediate this.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I see.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>A number of adventurers on the level of Rokuya-san, the designer of the dungeon, and the Marikosan\u2026let\u2019s leave those aside for now. Since we have come here with an objective, we can\u2019t kill the mercenary group.</p><br/><p>\u2026But the chances it will end up in an unavoidable fight are high.</p><br/><p>Hah\u2026Isn\u2019t the difficulty way too high? In a lot of meanings.</p><br/><p>Pione-san, why did you have to be inside such an important place? Seriously.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026The girl called Pione has been a real help when this place lost Doma and a lot of things happened. Raidou-kun, you have been born under an unlucky star.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>Lost Doma and a lot of things happened?</p><br/><p>That means\u2026it is her, Sofia is the root of all this.</p><br/><p>Gunununu, she really only does unnecessary things.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat damn Sofia.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was a woman whose presence felt somewhat like Root\u2019s. Are you acquainted with her?\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201cShe picked a fight with me, twice. There\u2026won\u2019t be a next time though.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. By the time she devoured Doma, she already had the power of several Superior Dragons though\u2026 Raidou-kun defeated her huh.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201cJust like in the matter with the Shadowless, she was the one picking a fight, so I had no choice.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cShe was in part, a pitiful woman. If she has already died, I will at least pray for her happiness in the otherworld.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are kind, Rokuya-san.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Whether it was Doma being killed or devoured, it still created a lot of problems here, and yet, he still mourns over Sofia\u2019s death?</p><br/><p>\u201cWait.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cHm? Is something the matter, Tomoe-dono?\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is it that you know the name Root, and why is it you are saying it as if it were natural? Is it okay to question you about that?\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cFumu, it isn\u2019t really something that needs to be hidden anyways. I don\u2019t mind. I am an acquaintance of that girl, Root.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201cGirl?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I unintentionally cut into their conversation.</p><br/><p>Root is currently a man mainly.</p><br/><p>He did tell me that if I undress, he will become a woman anytime I want. By the way, I have no intentions of doing that in my lifetime.</p><br/><p>But\u2026Root has been a man \u2018for a short while\u2019 which is in the time sense of a Superior Dragon.</p><br/><p>In other words\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like your relationship with the Myriad Colors Root dates pretty far in the past-ja na. In that case, I wonder how much of the legends about the Adventurers of Origin is actually true. I kind of want to hear it now.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What that Shougetsu boy told you guys, is\u2026well, the truth. Fufu, I wonder why, when you guys arrive at the 20th floor, we will probably clash blades, it will most likely be a disadvantageous fight for you guys, and it doesn\u2019t seem like our relationship will last for long. That\u2019s how I think, but\u2026a part of my heart currently is confident about something: \u2018we will continue our relationship with Raidou-kun, now and in the future\u2019. How mysterious.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t intend to lose either. No matter the situation, we plan on bringing it to a negotiation.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cEven that recklessness, there\u2019s a part of me that is looking forward to it, and that\u2019s surprising. In that case, I will answer in kind as well. Of course, I will also answer to the question of Tomoe-dono just now.\u201d (Rokuya)</p><br/><p>And then, Rokuya-san sips on his after-meal tea.</p><br/><p>The story of the Adventurers of Origin.</p><br/><p>The origin.</p><br/><p>Just what in the world are they really, just who this Rokuya-san in front of us actually is.</p><br/><p>For a tea time, this was tackling quite the topic of conversation.</p><br/><p>I decided to obediently listen to what Rokuya-san had to say.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

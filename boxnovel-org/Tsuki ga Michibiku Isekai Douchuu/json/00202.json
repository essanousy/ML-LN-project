So, there we go.</p><br/><p>Happy 200 chapters! \ud83d\ude00</p><br/><p>P.S: Guys, there\u2019s a lot of new POV\u2019s and Side Stories published already. To check the links for the sites, just go to the table of contents. For the people that haven\u2019t read it yet and are craving for more Tsuki.</p><br/><p>Rotsgard, Kuzunoha Company\u2019s office room.</p><br/><p>Today I am being at ease in this room.</p><br/><p>But well, it is not like I am not doing work.</p><br/><p>Right now I am in the middle of work related to the documents of the highly praised students.</p><br/><p>Shiki said he wants to make Jin an apprentice of his as a researcher.</p><br/><p>Jin was able to guess out my [Sakai] by instinct, and the power that he deployed -putting it in layman terms- he is able to make his opponent heavier or make himself lighter; it can be considered adjustment of gravity.</p><br/><p>He is unable to make himself lighter and the opponent heavier at the same time, but if he is just making himself lighter, it is possible to reduce the range of the spell.</p><br/><p>Jin is able to center the activation of the spell in a person other than himself, and opposite of being able to lighten himself, he is able to make the opponent heavier and reduce the range as well.</p><br/><p>Excluding the activation point and the consumption of magic power, the utilization of it is truly similar to that of Sakai.</p><br/><p>When I asked Shiki why he makes things heavier or lighter, he said that it is probably the easiest to picture in the interference with his space.</p><br/><p>From Jin\u2019s cognisance, the power will take effect at the direction where a mass is existing and trying to move, so the power actually takes effect when the target is actually moving, so it reduces the burden and losses, is what Shiki explained to me, and I understood the outline of it while ignoring the fine details.</p><br/><p>Shiki seemed to be having fun in a different sense from me.</p><br/><p>It might be the difference between a normal person and a researcher.</p><br/><p>In other words, Jin\u2019s new spell is a power that needs movement in order to increment its power.</p><br/><p>Impressive.</p><br/><p>I felt like I was hearing a physics lesson.</p><br/><p>In this world that hasn\u2019t developed that study properly, just how was Jin able to reach to that idea?</p><br/><p>Now that I think about it, he is also a member of the elites that attend the Rotsgard Academy.</p><br/><p>And a scholarship student at that.</p><br/><p>He must be a prodigy or a genius.</p><br/><p>It seems like Shiki was surprised in the same point as me. He took my physics book and it seems like he understood it by instinct, he opened it in the section regarding vectors.</p><br/><p>I\u2026don\u2019t hate physics, but I honestly didn\u2019t like it either.</p><br/><p>In terms of tests, it was one of the subjects that I was able to increase the grades satisfactorily.</p><br/><p>\u201cJin as a researcher huh. It differs a lot from the image of a dual-wielding warrior cutting through the vanguard.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cAt that point, Jin will probably become first rate and reach a stop there. In terms of being a researcher, he will probably be able to discover one or two groundbreaking ideas. There\u2019s plenty chance he can become more than first rate.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>But only as a researcher.</p><br/><p>How complicated.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe will probably be bewildered. Not as a clerk or as a warrior, but a disciple to become a researcher. By the way, aren\u2019t there other kids Shiki has an eye on?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Like Amelia maybe.</p><br/><p>It would be interesting if he were to say that he wants to have her dress in a wedding dress.</p><br/><p>If it is someone like that, I wouldn\u2019t mind that person entering Asora.</p><br/><p>Currently, the only ones that have the chance for that are Shiki and Lime after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. I think that even without my judgment, Sif and Yuno would have been hired as employees in given time. In terms of our relationship with Rembrandt-shi.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Well, that\u2019s how it is.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cIn terms of ability, there\u2019s nothing that especially interests me, but it seems like they have quite the good will towards us, so I think that there won\u2019t be any problems in using them as employees of the company. They also declared that they will be passing the merchant guild exam by the time they graduate, so it will be easier by the time we have a branch store.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cSo they have enough motivation huh. It seems like Rembrandt-san is also in approval of this. And, how about the others?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cOthers\u2026 Regarding Izumo, it seems like his true feelings are that he wants to return to his homeland Lorel, but in terms of his course, he hasn\u2019t consulted me. It seems like there\u2019s some circumstances, but he doesn\u2019t say it, so he probably has enough confidence that he can resolve it. The discord between head family and branch family is troublesome, so it would save us the pain. I think it would be better to leave it alone, and if Izumo contacts us, it would be good to take distance by limiting it to only listening to what he has to say. A magician that has no good or bad, there\u2019s no real appealing point that would make me want to hire him.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>He isn\u2019t saying it, but hey, he is talking as if he already knew everything.</p><br/><p>Head and branch family.</p><br/><p>It is a talk that could happen in Japan as well.</p><br/><p>It is true that it is not something that I would want to get involved in.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about Daena?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is married, so the person himself said that he would want to be employed in the Academy. \u2018If you are going to fight with the Academy, tell me first, I will run away\u2019, is what he said as he laughed while being drunk. His eyes were serious though. The same as Izumo; he isn\u2019t a talent that I would want to invite at all costs, so if he has a different path in mind, I wouldn\u2019t mind ignoring it.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cHis wife is pregnant, right?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>If I remember correctly, there were those kind of rumors.</p><br/><p>The person himself hasn\u2019t said anything though.</p><br/><p>If she has morning sickness, you can just be absent for the class and be by her side, is something I would want to tell him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. If Waka-sama were to hear that, you might tell him to take absence for the lectures and be together with her, so until she is stable, he wanted to have it stay as a secret at all costs, is what he requested me.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026He readily said that huh.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe morning sickness has calmed down quite a bit already. He has come to buy medicine a few times, but lately, he hasn\u2019t done that.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph~, are you telling me that he has been going to the Academy normally and taking classes while his wife was suffering with morning sickness?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Is that fine with you, husband?</p><br/><p>And the medicine as well, if you were to say it, we could have send it to your room.</p><br/><p>Since you are buying it at our place, we can provide at least that much service you know.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaena is also a special student, so I think that diligently doing his best as a special student of the Academy is actually something good though.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Is that how it works? Then what about Misura and Amelia?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe damage delay of Misura interests me a lot. By the time he graduates, I want to have it completely clarified. He is a favorite of Tomoe-dono, so she will probably train him until she is bored of it\u2026 If the person himself wishes it, it is possible to hire him as well.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cSaying it like that. Is there some sort of problem?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I was bothered by the slight time he took to say it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like his parents are ardent believers of the Goddess and want Misura to serve in the Church, or more like, they want him to be employed there. The person himself is troubled and holding his head because of it, but I think that the chances that he is pushed just like that and enters the Church are high.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cArdent believers of the Goddess\u2026 What withering words.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cHis fighting style and his personality are passive, so if he has already accepted being pushed by the flow, he can just do whatever he wants.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cI see.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cJust in case, I did tell him that there\u2019s the chance that the Church and Kuzunoha Company will confront, so he will probably groan about this until his graduation.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cHe would obviously be troubled.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThinking about a future where Waka-sama is laughing loudly and pointing a finger at him, even the passive Misura that goes with the flow, will probably desperately swim against that current. His parents or Waka-sama, I think we will be able to see an interesting decision.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026You are dark, Shiki.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks for the compliment.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, what about Amelia?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Since he is placing her at the end, maybe he is considering it pretty important?</p><br/><p>Or the contrary?</p><br/><p>\u201cAmelia is a jack of all trades and master of none, so there\u2019s no real appealing skill. There has been a scout coming from Gritonia Empire, and she already has the choice of entering their knight corps. She wants to be employed in our place, but there\u2019s no merit in it, so there\u2019s no need to.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>A scout from Gritonia huh.</p><br/><p>Quite the tall talk.</p><br/><p>It seems like Limia hasn\u2019t spoken to any specific student, so is there no candidate for Limia in the students?</p><br/><p>If I had to choose between Gritonia or Limia, I would without a doubt choose Limia though.</p><br/><p>Even so, that\u2019s cold.</p><br/><p>Amelia has been approaching Kuzunoha Company that aggressively, or more like, approaching Shiki, and yet\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cSo there\u2019s no one thinking about going to Limia?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe king has spoken to a few, but there\u2019s no approach from Limia Kingdom, so they probably haven\u2019t placed it in their options. Leaving aside Jin, Sif, and Yuno; I think that the other four have a chance of being invited by Limia.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cDaena and Misura as well?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Daena\u2019s wife is in this town, and Misura\u2019s parents are Church lovers, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Daena were to be invited with his whole family, there\u2019s plenty choice to go. I think that he will decide by the trouble of the moving and the treatment. About Misura, there\u2019s the hero chosen by the Goddess in Limia, so there\u2019s enough chance for his parents to accept.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>Senpai huh.</p><br/><p>It is true that if they are ardent believers of the Goddess, cooperating with the hero can enter in the choices.</p><br/><p>It might become a fulfilling job.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t understand it at all though.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Amelia, it doesn\u2019t seem like it is working.</p><br/><p>If I were asked if I wanted to hire her, I actually don\u2019t care whichever it is.</p><br/><p>\u201cWaka-sama, are you bothered by Amelia? Is there a part in her that you are interested in?\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>So he took it in that way huh.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, no. It seems like she is um\u2026quite attached to Shiki, and that\u2019s why she is working part-time at our place, right? And so, I was a bit bothered by it.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s only that, there\u2019s plenty other girls like that at the Academy, so in terms of wanting to embrace her, it isn\u2019t to that degree. She is the only one that\u2019s taking the lectures within those girls though.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u2026Maybe I should have Shiki go to the Academy alone once and tail him for that one day.</p><br/><p>Just how popular are you?</p><br/><p>Be it Lime or Shiki; learn a bit from Rembrandt-san who is single mindedly in love with his wife.</p><br/><p>And so, sorry Amelia.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t intend to get in the way of someone else\u2019s love, but I don\u2019t have any intentions of touching it either.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Amelia\u2026if I remember correctly\u2026\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Could it be, a revival route?</p><br/><p>\u201cShe is appealing as a base for a chimera, like the ones at the hyuman base. With her compatibility to elements and her abilities, she is great all around, so\u2026I was thinking about fulfilling the subjects I have few data about.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cUwaa~.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>It probably would have been better if I didn\u2019t ask.</p><br/><p>\u201cI received an interesting document from Tomoe-dono, but as expected, raw experiments are important.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026too much. It would be safer to have Amelia leave to a different country as an elite huh.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>At worst, she would go to Gritonia and fall victim to Tomoki, but\u2026it should be better than being a guinea pig for Shiki.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. Well, it is still future talk anyways.They are currently gaining a higher salary than some adults, so they probably won\u2019t choose the paths they have compromised to.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>Right.</p><br/><p>Jin and the others are receiving quite the high salary every month from the Academy.</p><br/><p>If they were to become my employees, the salary they get would probably be lower.</p><br/><p>Ah, Jin.</p><br/><p>Shiki said that it would be good to hire Jin, but is the person himself intending to come to our place?</p><br/><p>\u201cJin\u2026intends to come to our place?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe person himself hasn\u2019t thought of any other path aside from that, is what he said.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>He is serious huh.</p><br/><p>\u201cHis salary will decrease though.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Jin strongly aims for higher heights, but lately, he has been showing a slight change.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cHm?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cSince the moment we met him, he has been dry about his sensation for loss and gains, and he had a tendency to decide in that way. And that hasn\u2019t changed at all since now.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Would he want to be employed in Kuzunoha Company?</p><br/><p>He will definitely suffer a loss.</p><br/><p>\u201cJin understands it. That there\u2019s a lot of value in the experience that he can obtain in Kuzunoha Company. And that he won\u2019t be able to obtain it in any other place.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>Experience is worth.</p><br/><p>Ah, so the loss and gain sense of his also counts that.</p><br/><p>Then I can understand.</p><br/><p>Something that only in that place you can do.</p><br/><p>Things that he can learn only in that place.</p><br/><p>\u2026Fufu, if his loss and gain sensation are dry because of that, I am also like that.</p><br/><p>For the first time, I felt familiarity with Jin.</p><br/><p>\u201cMerit huh. Leaving aside Asora, I am doing outside work as an owner of Kuzunoha Company and playing as a make-believe adventurer after all. It is not like I don\u2019t understand him.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cJin still has a lot to go before being able to reach Akua and Eris by himself, but that kid probably wants to become stronger in Kuzunoha Company.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cStronger\u2026\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why he wants to be stronger though.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cShiki, that\u2019s fine. Even if you know, don\u2019t tell me. If Jin wants to tell me, he will do so.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Understood.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>I felt like he knew, like in the case of Izumo, so I stopped him.</p><br/><p>\u2026I see.</p><br/><p>The students are thinking a lot.</p><br/><p>And so, Amelia is in a pretty precarious position.</p><br/><p>She is not totally out, so there\u2019s a chance\u2026probably.</p><br/><p>No matter how it rolls, I don\u2019t think I will be showing them Asora, so they are people that I don\u2019t think there\u2019s the need to be counted as a danger.</p><br/><p>And so, about my opinion of Jin and the others, as a teacher involved with them in lectures, I think that it is fine if they just go to the paths that they have worked hard to head to.</p><br/><p>Ah, maybe that\u2019s why I was bothered by Amelia who wanted to be hired in Kuzunoha Company.</p><br/><p>It is sad that there\u2019s no choice but to use the state power there, but that makes me, me after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, Waka-sama. Before heading to Limia, let\u2019s do a little selection within these student candidates.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are doing it right now? Isn\u2019t it okay to do it in Limia?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>There\u2019s an incredible pile after all.</p><br/><p>And it looks like the chances of reaching the summit in their level is pretty low.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, the final check will be done while heading to Limia, but there\u2019s this amount after all. We have to advance even if for a bit.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Right.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>It is not an amount that we can take, and actually, it is a bit impossible to leave in Asora.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so, here.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>Shiki gave me a bundle of documents with the thickness of a tissue box.</p><br/><p>I could feel a pressure surpassing its weight.</p><br/><p>First, I should check these ones out huh.</p><br/><p>Can I finish checking them all?</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd about that pile over there\u2026\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cHm?!\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>The mountain of documents that Shiki pointed with his finger, burned in an instant.</p><br/><p>A fire!</p><br/><p>It will turn into a fire!</p><br/><p>\u201cWa?!\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe fire won\u2019t spread, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I see.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout that mountain, they are all failures. I have dealt with it with a small performance.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t do it with such a pleasant smile.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t do it so suddenly.</p><br/><p>It will normally surprise me.</p><br/><p>This is a closed room.</p><br/><p>The second floor of the store.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen that means, from all of that, only this much is left?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. There\u2019s still a relative amount of it, but after seeing that mountain, I feel like this amount is something possible.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I do feel that way.</p><br/><p>Shiki magic huh.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeriously, just looking at that made me feel like my brain would be contaminated. It felt like a dangerous substance, and the amount was a lot as well. I don\u2019t know what would have happened if Waka were to see it.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Aren\u2019t those documents about the application for my lecture?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe documents here are not all good either, but are on an acceptable level that giving it to Waka-sama can turn into experience, so\u2026\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cI am already scared of even looking at it.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>What experience?</p><br/><p>What\u2019s this about acceptable level?</p><br/><p>What\u2019s that about dangerous substance that can contaminate the brain?</p><br/><p>\u201cI did an all nighter death march and got kinda high, so there\u2019s probably interesting components still remaining within those documents. Please do take them with you to Limia.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cT-Thank you for your hard work.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>So having continuous all nighters can make Shiki dangerous as well huh.</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t imagine it, but I should at least be prepared.</p><br/><p>Anyways, Limia huh.</p><br/><p>I have not decided which follower I should be taking with me.</p><br/><p>Shiki would be fine, but he has a lot of things he has to do.</p><br/><p>It is also a bottleneck that he is acquainted with Hibiki-senpai and her group.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, I will be checking the state of the sea.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Shiki, regarding Limia.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c? What is it?\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cTomoe or Mio, who do you think would be better to bring?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cMio-dono.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>Instant answer.</p><br/><p>Or more like\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cShiki, why are you averting your gaze?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Not only that, his eyes are swimming.</p><br/><p>Why is he showing such obvious suspicious behavior?</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for me, I think that Mio-dono is a good choice.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cShiki\u2026\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Did something happen in the shadows?</p><br/><p>He has made a complete change from before and is not looking my way at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cT-The sun is still high up in the sky of Asora, so I will be using a bikini and bath in the seawater that I haven\u2019t tasted for several hundred of years!!\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cBikini?!\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t that the part where you say trunks?!</p><br/><p>No wait.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease tell Mio-dono that Shiki has given his support in having her go alone with you! I will be going now!!\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cShiki?!!\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Please tell her?!</p><br/><p>That girl\u2026Mio.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s also the matter with the suit, but it feels like she is plotting something.</p><br/><p>It is surely not something that would bring me harm though.</p><br/><p>I know that.</p><br/><p>I know that but\u2026</p><br/><p>I-It makes me uneasy.</p><br/><p>I am suddenly anxious about going to Limia.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

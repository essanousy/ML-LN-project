Isn\u2019t it a major power that is fighting over the first and second place?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>A vague question from Senpai.</p><br/><p>Leaving aside that I might have answered differently If she had made a more concrete question, I gave my impressions of Limia.</p><br/><p>I have a few bad impressions of the rampant nobles, but\u2026if I had to give a good part of it, it would be that, honestly, I don\u2019t have much of an impression.</p><br/><p>\u201cFufufu, a major power huh. That\u2019s true. But you see, in truth, the major power that you and I imagine are quite different. It is also a half-hearted country.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cHalf-hearted?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t think a major power can be half-hearted.</p><br/><p>It is a major power because many people live there, right?</p><br/><p>In that case, it wouldn\u2019t be able to function as a country without a superior system supporting it.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor example, the population, Makoto-kun, how much do you think is the population of Limia?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>P-Population?</p><br/><p>This is a topic I have not cared at all for since coming to this world.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026The territory of Limia is wide, so maybe around the ten millions or hundred millions?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Looking at its territory only, I don\u2019t think it would be strange for them to have at least this much.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe correct answer is: I don\u2019t know.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cHah?\u201d</p><br/><p>What\u2019s with that?</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t that cheating?</p><br/><p>\u201cIn this world, there\u2019s practically no country \u2013including Limia\u2013 that has a clear grasp of their population. From what I know, the only one that has a grasp on it is Tsige. Moreover, the ones in possession of the information were not government officials of the country, but a single company.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Seriously?</p><br/><p>One company?</p><br/><p>\u2026I feel like there\u2019s only one who fits the bill.</p><br/><p>I wonder if he has a grasp on the population even in the current sudden increases it is having, Rembrandt-san.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is most likely difficult\u2026probably.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>A grasp on the number of people\u2026inhabitant\u2019s ballot, no, a census huh.</p><br/><p>Wait, it should have existed in Japan since quite a long time ago though\u2026</p><br/><p>In other words, it shouldn\u2019t be difficult?</p><br/><p>Unless it is quite the chaotic era.</p><br/><p>This world is currently in war, but thinking about the time in which it began in my previous world, it wouldn\u2019t be strange for them to be able to do it.</p><br/><p>If we are talking about a chaos that made the document burn in fire and had the minds of people agitated to the point of being unable to keep things like that in mind, it would be\u2026the revolution at the Ounin era, maybe?</p><br/><p>In the past, even when I investigated in my free time about that era, I couldn\u2019t understand it well.</p><br/><p>The enemies became allies, and even when the Heads of both powers were affiliated to the same camp, the battle continued, and by the time I noticed, it was already the Sengoku period.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t think this world is in the same state.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t have the will to do so, they don\u2019t find any reason to do it; it is just because of that. They just report about an approximate of the harvest, and from that report, they decide the tax. With a system like that, there\u2019s little point in keeping the population number in check.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I see.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>They decide the tax by the land huh.</p><br/><p>It is certainly true that by doing that, they are able to leave the rest to the nobles.</p><br/><p>I feel like they are just pushing all the responsibility away though, but if the income is properly coming in, it doesn\u2019t seem to be a problem.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut if a country is thinking about obtaining power, it is a topic that can\u2019t be ignored. And in truth, I would say that Limia\u2019s population is around 50 million to 70 million, but the tax yields are only around half of that number. So it is like they can avoid tax as much as they want.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cHalf\u2026 The remaining would be embezzlement huh.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Limia is practically a despotism of nobles after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I am sorry about asking for a consent after the fact, but we are currently utilizing your help in order to improve this part.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cMe?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Did I do something?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was a real help. Thanks.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo well, I don\u2019t have much awareness of this, but if I was of help\u2026that\u2019s great. Or more like, Senpai, you are even doing things like improvements?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I feel like this has to do with the very foundations of the country.</p><br/><p>\u201cImprovement is a special skill from Japan after all. There\u2019s no way I wouldn\u2019t use it just because I am in a parallel world, right? I brought out the topic of population as an example, but there\u2019s a lot of things that can be changed in this world for the better.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t that saying too much?</p><br/><p>Improvement isn\u2019t something only Japan does, it is done in the whole planet Earth.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell it is not like it shouldn\u2019t be used but\u2026it seems like you are putting a lot of zeal into this country.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026This is the country I have been summoned in.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is the country where I know the most people, and the country where the most people know of me. It is the country that has placed their expectations on me. Isn\u2019t it a matter of course that I think deeply of it?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I felt like I was being criticized, so I ended up apologizing.</p><br/><p>Well, I also think deeply of Asora, so it should be about the same.</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s that, I feel like I can understand.</p><br/><p>Different from Asora, Limia is connected by land with other countries and if there\u2019s enemies, they can get attacked though.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I want you to like this country as well. Is it\u2026difficult to desire that?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The eyes of Senpai were dyed in seriousness.</p><br/><p>\u201cMakoto-kun, this world and the Goddess, it is certainly true that it is very different from the common sense of our original world. There\u2019s definitely things that you can\u2019t just accept and things that are unreasonable.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know that you don\u2019t hold positive feelings towards the Goddess. At this occasion, I won\u2019t tell you to throw those away. Just that, for the sake of finishing this long war\u2026 can\u2019t you please lend us your strength? Of course, I won\u2019t be telling you to learn of war either. It is fine to supply us with goods at a suitable price.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>So she is telling me to supply the goods of Limia huh.</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s to lend strength to Senpai only, it would be a different case, but if I were to cooperate in supplying the goods in order to finish the war, it would mean that I have taken the side of hyumans.</p><br/><p>Meaning that, even if it\u2019s indirectly, I am participating in the war.</p><br/><p>Yeah, can\u2019t do.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no choice but to refuse.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026How about it?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, I can\u2019t. If it\u2019s just selling things to Senpai personally, I wouldn\u2019t mind though.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. So you won\u2019t be cooperating \u2018for the sake of putting an end to the war\u2019 huh.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u2026Ah.</p><br/><p>Even I could tell that Senpai emphasized the words at the latter half.</p><br/><p>So they are already suspecting that I have a connection with the demon race huh.</p><br/><p>They don\u2019t have any positive proof of it, so they can\u2019t ask about this crime though.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking on opening the doors of Kuzunoha Company to all that need it. Please let me cooperate in the sense of neutrality.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou see, Makoto-kun\u2026I don\u2019t think that all the actions of the Goddess are correct.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c?!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Senpai?!</p><br/><p>No wait, isn\u2019t that something a hero shouldn\u2019t say?!</p><br/><p>\u201cShe is not the \u2018God\u2019 that we think of. She has a personality, and individuality. I have not heard of the existence of other Gods in this world aside from her, so it shouldn\u2019t be wrong to say that she is the only God though.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. There\u2019s no way I would accept something like that as a God.</p><br/><p>The God that Senpai is talking about is probably the almighty one.</p><br/><p>That kind of God, I have not met one either.</p><br/><p>But\u2026I do think that there\u2019s no way it is okay to leave that Goddess do as she pleases.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe existence that manages and watches over this world. The Gods that exist are probably people that do these kind of jobs. Honestly, even now, I still think that she is a woman with problems in her personality.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cSenpai\u2026\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Makoto-kun, no matter the existence she is, she lives in a different place from us, in other words, an existence that has nothing to do with us, you know? Even for us, the day we met that night was the last. Until then, I didn\u2019t believe in the existence of God. In other words, isn\u2019t she only an existence that we met in a mere instant of our short lives?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat will you do by maintaining that feeling of defeat inside of you? It is like having complains about the laws and phenomenons that naturally exist in the world. Isn\u2019t it pointless?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did Senpai\u2026?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did Senpai come to this world? Even though you had a life of success secured over there.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t understand at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to know the reason why I came to this world?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are interested in the reason of why someone like me, who shouldn\u2019t have any relation to this world to begin with, would come to this world?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c!\u201d</p><br/><p>Does Senpai know?</p><br/><p>The fact that the two being summoned was the fault of me and my parents.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Because I thought it was interesting.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the main reason?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it is not like I don\u2019t hold any feelings of wanting to return to my life in Japan. However, at that time, at that instant, I certainly did feel that being in a parallel world was appealing. That\u2019s why I am here. In the end, the whole reason I am here is because of the feelings of that instant. From then, I created connections in this world more and more, and I can no longer separate from it so easily.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cFeelings of that instant.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>So Senpai currently doesn\u2019t have intentions of going back then.</p><br/><p>I can sense that from her.</p><br/><p>Even though she said she wanted to return a bit, I couldn\u2019t feel a single trace of homesickness from Senpai\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Empire\u2019s Tomoki must be the same. Well, if the Goddess had asked him the previous day or the day after, his answer might have differed. There\u2019s plenty possibility that different heroes would be summoned, and he and I would currently be living a peaceful life in Japan.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Right.</p><br/><p>At that day, in just that instant, the two decided to become heroes.</p><br/><p>A decision is a decision.</p><br/><p>But if we were to call it a thoroughly thought decision, as expected, that wouldn\u2019t be the case.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is not like I am blaming Makoto-kun. Don\u2019t make that face. Let me advance the topic. In this world, the interference of God is not something definite or anything like that. This world will most likely change more and more. If we can finish the war soon and calm down the quarrel between hyumans and demons, we would be able to use that much time in changing the world.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cChange\u2026the world?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. It can\u2019t be done easily, but I think it is possible to create a society where hyumans and demi-humans don\u2019t discriminate each other.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Reforming the very thinking of hyumans then?</p><br/><p>But as long as the foundation of that thinking lies in the teachings of the goddess, I think it is impossible.</p><br/><p>Even in the teachings of the Spirits, they are told that demi-humans are existences below hyumans, you know?</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you are a hero, isn\u2019t that way too idealistic? This is a world where a big number of hyumans follow a religion that goes against that very ideal of yours.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t Makoto-kun showing that possibility yourself? In Rotsgard and Tsige. It is possible to wake up the hyuman society as a whole with those actions, right? I don\u2019t think the Goddess would be able to forcefully amend the people that want to change themselves. I have investigated decades of activities from her, but she herself is docile and simply has a deep affection for beautiful hyumans, and she doesn\u2019t punish hyumans that hold a different way of thinking from what she wills. At least in public it is known in that way.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>So Senpai is trying to change the Goddess\u2019 world from the inside?</p><br/><p>But if that\u2019s the case, her thinking should be close to mine, and yet, why is it that I feel like Senpai is so far away?</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, Senpai, even if the Goddess doesn\u2019t exist anymore in this world, for example; even if a different God were to take her place, you wouldn\u2019t mind, right?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Well, even if I say a different God, I don\u2019t have a specific God in mind though.</p><br/><p>I am just saying and see how she reacts.</p><br/><p>But if Senpai does think that way, I thought that maybe it would be possible to form a cooperative relationship with her.</p><br/><p>If she thinks that a society where demi-humans don\u2019t face discrimination is better, it would be possible to speak with the demons as well.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Even if the Goddess is gone?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cF-Figuratively speaking.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>In the case that I actually fight her, win, and punish her, I don\u2019t know if the Goddess will continue managing this world as always.</p><br/><p>In that case, I thought that since a God is gone, there would be a different God coming to fill her place.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t have any effect on the world at all, I wouldn\u2019t mind. Just that\u2026\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cJust that\u2026?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf the Goddess is gone, the Spirits that work as her servants will be gone, and then she -the manager of this world- would be gone. Who knows what kind of effect would bring to the magic power that serves as the nucleus of this world. On top of that, the blessings and divine protection will disappear and the status of the Church will fall. There\u2019s also the fear that the very teachings of the Goddess will be thrown away as well.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t think that far ahead.</p><br/><p>Because I didn\u2019t care at all about what would happen to this world after the Goddess lost her power or at worst, died.</p><br/><p>It is fine to just bring the people that want refuge into Asora first, and in the first place, it is a world that existed even when the Goddess wasn\u2019t there.</p><br/><p>It seems like people like Root where there at that time, so I think that it won\u2019t go to the point of being impossible to live in.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t think further than that.</p><br/><p>But it seems like Senpai had thought about the things that would happen if the Goddess were to fall.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if, for argument\u2019s sake, it turns peaceful at that time, the world will instantly fall into great chaos, and there\u2019s an incredibly high chance that hell will break loose. Especially the hyumans that had received the affection of the Goddess, there\u2019s the chance that the other races will view them as enemies.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is certainly true that there\u2019s the chance.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Or more like, it will definitely turn out that way.</p><br/><p>The blessing will be gone, so leaving aside the people that have true strength, most of the hyumans will be facing a hard time.</p><br/><p>Also, if the common language disappears, it might turn into a mess, like the Tower of Babel.</p><br/><p>They wouldn\u2019t be able to create a big country like now, so the hegemony of the world will probably be changed to another race.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you are saying you have a method that will not show a single effect like that to the world, I don\u2019t mind.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cThen if there\u2019s an effect like what Senpai has stated?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if it costs me my life, I will go against it.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Even if it costs you your life?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s someone planning something like that, it would be the same as the demon race; a world-class terrorist. Ruthlessly cornering the people that are living in peace and taking away their lives. It is enough to call it pure evil. The ones facing the most damage would be the hyumans, but the demi-humans will also be involved with no exception.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cTerrorist. The demons are a different race, they possess a country, and are opponents that you are fighting in war. Even though you are doing war with them, you call them in that way. Aren\u2019t you a bit too prejudiced?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Terrorist is a word I didn\u2019t expect.</p><br/><p>To call the war with the demons terrorism\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. It is like a war brought by the minority that knew that no matter what they tried, they wouldn\u2019t be able to reign supreme against the majority. That\u2019s probably why the Goddess got impatient and called the heroes.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe demon race is the minority?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I imagine the conflicts and invasions of places like Russia and China.</p><br/><p>I remember the words of Zef.</p><br/><p>If I remember correctly, he said that the demon race population is at most 1 million or 1.5 million.</p><br/><p>If Limia has several millions just like Senpai said, the hyuman population is most likely more than 4 times that.</p><br/><p>They are called the four major powers, so I was expecting that though.</p><br/><p>So if it\u2019s 50 million, then 200 million?</p><br/><p>Two hundred million against a few millions.</p><br/><p>If the other demi-humans are added to the equation, would it turn into the ten millions?</p><br/><p>The demon race units are originally composed by mixed races.</p><br/><p>No, even with that, it would still be an incredibly low number compared to hyumans.</p><br/><p>Whichever the case, this is not on the level of war.</p><br/><p>Just like Senpai said, this is on the level of a small insurrection.</p><br/><p>Even if we take into account that this world counts more the quality than the quantity, it is honestly incredible that the demon race is putting up a good fight.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf the demon race request of it, it would bring the denial of the Goddess and her retribution\u2026Well, it wouldn\u2019t go so far, but they should at least be able to seek a better treatment. What they are doing is denying the very social system of this world they have been living in.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cThey could have gone into extinction if they hadn\u2019t done that.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really take the side of demons here.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cI have seen something that made me realize just how severe the Goddess\u2019 discrimination was, after all. Then, the actions of the demon race were brought by the need of surviving.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, their raising of an army in this occasion was probably something unavoidable.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2014!\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat means it is already too late. They had to do something before it turned out that way. To better that scorned environment they had even if for a bit, they should have tried to make the hyumans accept them. With a method aside from taking arms, that is.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>No way, that\u2019s asking for too much.</p><br/><p>Regarding the demon race, it was practically as if the Goddess made the first move telling them to go away and cornered them. </p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that just asking for too much?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cI have taken a look at the history of demons and hyumans. Of course, this was from the historical records of hyumans, so there\u2019s most likely bias there though. Just that, there haven\u2019t been much events where the demons have acted in a positive way towards hyumans. And within those small number of people, there\u2019s not a single one that has continued for long.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cHistory. The history between hyumans and demons.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I only know rough details of it.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor the demons, hyumans are an overwhelming majority, moreover, it is collected in a single religion, it is also an opponent that has better individual battle power, you know? From the beginning, the choice of fighting was not something sane.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Right.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Because of the blessing of the Goddess, the demon race was also being overpowered by hyumans in the magic power side as well, so there was no good part in it.</p><br/><p>The more I think about it, the more impressed I am by the demons being able to put up a good fight against the hyumans.</p><br/><p>Well, it is not like they have been doing war forever. They were mostly enduring the discrimination and oppression.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut the demons fought with the hyumans several times, lost, and still, they haven\u2019t changed their way of dealing with things.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey should have had several opportunities to. The chance to enter within hyumans just like the demi-humans.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it were me, that\u2019s what I would do. If it\u2019s a big opponent and I am unable to do anything about it with our power, I would join them and change them from the inside. I would create an opportunity to enter, and then, manage something from there. Isn\u2019t that one of the few choices that the minority has in order to survive?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you saying that they should live amidst hyumans as slaves?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Even if it\u2019s a starting line from a slave position, it is possible to crawl their way up. But they took arms to the very end. I don\u2019t have the intention of wiping them all out, but if we don\u2019t corner them to that very limit to show an example, no one would be able to accept it. At the very least, we would have to eliminate the people that are managing their country, their army, and the ones cooperating with them; every one of them.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cAccept it, you say. Isn\u2019t that also because of the warped teachings of the Goddess?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>If only she hadn\u2019t tainted this world with her stupid teachings, this wouldn\u2019t have turned out this way.</p><br/><p>The existence of that Goddess is the main reason for this problem, so they probably have to confront her at some point in time.</p><br/><p>In that case, even if it will somewhat trouble the people that are currently living, isn\u2019t it a lot better to just eliminate that Goddess that has spread this strange way of thinking?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe warped teachings of the Goddess huh. But that is the religion that all the world follows, you know. Isn\u2019t that the same as having an overwhelming minority taking arms?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you are saying that they should resign to their fate? That the teachings of the Goddess can\u2019t be helped, and it also can\u2019t be helped that the demon race is rendered impossible to stand back up? That because they didn\u2019t conform with those conditions quickly and become slaves for the sake of surviving, it can\u2019t be helped that they are receiving a worse treatment than that? Is that what you think, Senpai?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I am kind of pissed here.</p><br/><p>No matter who, if they are being oppressed, they would want to make a complain or two.</p><br/><p>To expect those kind of people to calmly look at the situation, think of the future, and find a good way for the race to survive, something like that\u2026who would be able to blame them for being unable to do that?</p><br/><p>To be able to act composedly no matter when, that\u2019s not something that anyone could do.</p><br/><p>Thinking that way, I unconsciously spoke to Senpai in a harsh tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c!!\u201d</p><br/><p>It is not like I thought Senpai would make a troubled expression\u2026but I thought she would at least show hesitation.</p><br/><p>The instant answer of Senpai blocked my words.</p><br/><p>\u201cI said this just a few moments ago but, the demon race and the hyumans are already in a situation where it is already too late. Without a closure for this war, neither of the races will be able to advance. That\u2019s how much hatred is gathered between both sides. Of course, I who has been fighting alongside Limia, am no exception. The Goddess\u2019 teachings, their dependence to her, the discrimination towards demi-humans; all these problems are problems that can only be dealt with after this war is over. This one point is impossible to move or change anymore. No one is able to.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo one\u2026\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Is that true?</p><br/><p>If it is the Kuzunoha Company that has a connection with both, wouldn\u2019t it be able to work out somehow?</p><br/><p>\u2026No.</p><br/><p>Before that, wouldn\u2019t things change a lot if I just had that Bug reflect?</p><br/><p>\u201cNo one. Even for Makoto, that\u2019s impossible. The hyumans that had their family taken away by demons had their hatred grow inside of themselves, and that hatred becomes the fangs that point towards them. It is the same for the demons that had their family taken away by hyumans. This chain of losses\u2026.can\u2019t be erased.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Senpai made a pained expression for an instant.</p><br/><p>The current Senpai is as cold as ice, and she is speaking with an indifferent expression, so that one instant remained in my mind.</p><br/><p>Memories can\u2019t be erased huh.</p><br/><p>Rotsgard has become a lot easier to live in, but it is certainly true that it would be hard to erase that memory.</p><br/><p>The more there are, the higher the amount of deaths there will be after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cHatred and sadness. It is not something that easily disappears. I\u2026can understand that.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>As I thought, I should do something quick about that Goddess.</p><br/><p>Senpai seems to be worried about the later, but in the end, if the Goddess remains, the current state of things won\u2019t change.</p><br/><p>I will have to revise my attitude towards Bug.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe demons who are the minority, are going against the overwhelming majority which are the hyumans, and the Goddess. This revolution that terrorists have raised which the majority of the people in this world didn\u2019t wish for, this madness of a war, I will end it as soon as possible. Makoto-kun, I will say it again. Lend us your power, please.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Senpai lowers her head deeply.</p><br/><p>But my thoughts won\u2019t change.</p><br/><p>Actually, I think that Senpai is over-thinking this in a way too realistic of a manner.</p><br/><p>In this world that the Goddess does whatever she wants, I don\u2019t feel like they would be able to change their sense of worth even if they took their time trying.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Senpai, I will say it again as well. I refuse.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me say this frankly, the stance that you Kuzunoha Company are taking can bring advantage to the demon race. The act of providing goods to both sides in a war, is an act of a merchant asking for a death sentence, you know? Is the Kuzunoha Company wishing for war and looking to gain profit from it?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I also think that it would be better if the war didn\u2019t exist. Just that, I think that the whole reason for this is that Goddess, and if only we could make her change her way of thinking, there would be as many methods born from it.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? Even if the Goddess is the cause, what does Makoto-kun plan on doing?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is not wrong that the policy of the Kuzunoha Company is to welcome anyone that needs it, but\u2026I personally think it would be better to drag down that Goddess once.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cDrag down the Goddess\u2026\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Senpai makes a short mutter and turned speechless.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is certainly true that the world will fall into a temporal chaos, and it might put a limit to the magic that magicians can use. It might turn into an End of the Century situation between hyumans and demi-humans, but even with that, I think that the best plan is to kick that woman out from the God position she has been lying on.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026How?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, by force.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cBy force, you say. The opponent is a God you know? Even if, for argument\u2019s sake, you were to overpower her, would you be able to substitute for her?!\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cOverpower? I don\u2019t know about that, but I don\u2019t intend to become the replacement of her.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you will simply eliminate a God?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Senpai held her head and shook it aimlessly.</p><br/><p>No no no, I don\u2019t plan on eliminating her.</p><br/><p>I was thinking that it would be fine to just leave her a bit further from half-dead.</p><br/><p>I am still alive after all, and the reason why I met with Tomoe and the others was in part because of that Bug.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo well, she is not the only God out there, so as we do our stuff, a substitute will come, probably.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026You speak as if you have met other Gods. Well, I have been brought to a strange place with a shady individual though.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cHow to say it, I have met with a God-sama that seems to be an acquaintance of that Goddess.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026That\u2019s why you are saying that you will be changing that Goddess\u2019 way of thinking by force? Without thinking at all about the repercussions that it can cause.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf something happens, we can just take refuge until things settle down.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are really indifferent at the crisis of hyumans. You don\u2019t discriminate demi-humans, but you discriminate hyumans huh.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>?!!</p><br/><p>No no!</p><br/><p>I am not discriminating hyumans.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am not discriminating demi-humans or hyumans.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026You are seriously saying that. Then this is serious.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom Makoto-kun\u2019s speech and conduct, you are flickering your thoughts that it can\u2019t be helped since the hyumans have done whatever they wanted along with the Goddess.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it is true that the hyumans have done whatever they wanted for so long, right?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s not discrimination, it is the truth.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, but to give a cold reception because of that, isn\u2019t that considered discrimination?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cHyumans are the strong ones that overwhelm this world with their numbers. Why would the word discrimination apply for them?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t discrimination something done by society\u2019s strong ones over the weak ones?</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so what?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you saying that even if someone were to discriminate rulers, it wouldn\u2019t be considered discrimination? The gazes that the hyumans direct towards demi-humans is peculiar, but have you noticed? Makoto-kun, at times, you have directed those kind of gazes towards hyumans. Even here, and at Rotsgard as well.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>If she brings out gazes, I can\u2019t say I am conscious of it.</p><br/><p>But if I am asked if it is okay to show discriminating actions towards the strong, I would say it is not.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey Makoto-kun, in the structure of this world, you and I are considered outsiders, right? In that case, not taking into account the past history and coming in contact with the hyumans and demi-humans in equal grounds, isn\u2019t that how a person that doesn\u2019t discriminate would act? If there\u2019s a person that\u2019s troubled in front of you, shouldn\u2019t you be stretching out your hand no matter the way that person has been living until now and their social standing? For hyumans, they have done whatever they have wanted, so they should suck it up; for demi-humans, they are pitiful, so help them. Isn\u2019t that what you would call discrimination towards hyumans?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut the hyumans have been utilizing the demi-humans as their servants, and they have been living shouldering this. In the first place, there\u2019s no way I would be able to look at them with eyes like those of a Saint.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why. You end up thinking that way because you are thinking with our common sense. This is not Japan, this is a parallel world. In the common sense of this world, hyumans and demi-humans are this way. In the first place, the demon race has picked a fight against that common sense and have brought about a war, you know?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026That\u2019s a mistaken common sense.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cAs a Japanese, that is. Your basis for your cold reception towards hyumans is something that\u2019s natural common sense, and most people would not understand being criticized for it. Even in hyumans, when in situations between other hyumans, where you take out the attitude towards demi-humans and their attachment to beauty, they are people that properly hate discrimination.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you take out things that shouldn\u2019t be taken out, it won\u2019t make me accept it.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cTo change their root cognition, there\u2019s the need for time, which would have to be after the war is over. But if there\u2019s Makoto-kun who wants to do that by force against the Goddess, it would all end up crumbling.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cNot really. I might lose, and it is okay for Senpai to just continue doing war. I will be moving with my own thoughts. Even if it\u2019s Senpai, I won\u2019t be affirming everything you say and obeying it.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you were to lose, that would be\u2026\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Senpai places both arms on the handrail and bends her body.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026There\u2019s plenty chance for it to happen. Even if she is like that, she is still a God after all.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Words leaked out from Senpai who had her face hidden, a mutter of expectation for me to lose.</p><br/><p>From the conversation until now, I could tell that it would be a pleasant development for her.</p><br/><p>I am slightly shocked, but it can\u2019t be helped.</p><br/><p>Senpai seems to be entirely against the idea of me fighting the Goddess after all.</p><br/><p>Even so, I am practically not thinking about the effects that will bring forth to the world like Senpai said.</p><br/><p>I refuse managing a world like this, and I don\u2019t want to become a God either.</p><br/><p>Instead of arranging such pointless things, it is much more important to find a method to return to my original world with Tomoe and the others while being able to go back and forth to Asora.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine you losing.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>As if resenting me, Senpai turned a sulking face towards me.</p><br/><p>\u201cW-Well, thanks.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThings like being too far away, the scale being too much, or the numbers being way too many; I know that I can\u2019t do anything about those, but this is the first time I have felt that no matter what I do, I won\u2019t be able to surpass an individual. Even if I went at full power in my current self.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>The full power of the current Senpai huh.</p><br/><p>As I thought, maybe she has obtained some power like that of Sakai.</p><br/><p>Even if that\u2019s not the case, there\u2019s definitely something.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo well, Senpai was also strong, you know. It was like \u2018as expected of a hero\u2019.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though you were not serious at all. Heh~, then, between me and the Demon Lord, who is stronger?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026If I were to fight the Demon Lord, I would be able to answer you.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, what about Io, White One?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026With that strong attack power, maybe you can win against Io?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>To fight with that person, it would depend on how well you can surpass that regeneration power of his after all.</p><br/><p>But if you were to try and go until he is unable to regenerate, it would turn into an incredible endurance battle.</p><br/><p>I think there would be the need to finish the fight in one go.</p><br/><p>Senpai has faced painful experiences with him, right?</p><br/><p>If I remember correctly, she has close to a terrible affinity against him.</p><br/><p>But if it\u2019s the current Senpai, she might be able to defeat him.</p><br/><p>Thinking about it that way, she is a dangerous one.</p><br/><p>Because that means she is stronger than that scary-looking giant.</p><br/><p>\u201cReceiving the input of the White One, I feel my confidence strengthening. That guy\u2026is someone I have to win against no matter what, after all.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cI see.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>After meeting several times in the battlefield, something like destiny is born, maybe.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t have much of those.</p><br/><p>Aside from that Goddess.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Senpai releases the handrail, and stretches her body upright.</p><br/><p>Maybe because of her experience in kendo, Senpai\u2019s posture is good.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that means Kuzunoha Company and Raidou are the allies of everyone in trouble, right? Okay, I got it.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cHah?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I-Is that okay?</p><br/><p>That helps me out though.</p><br/><p>No matter how much she asks me to cooperate with Limia, I won\u2019t be nodding after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cOn top of that, I have learned that you are a troublesome person that is fully antagonistic towards the Goddess. Well, about that, I will keep it a secret for you though.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Thanks.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Goddess probably hasn\u2019t heard of it either after all. With the capital having been raided, leaving aside the blessing and divine protection, there has been practically no reaction from her. What she is thinking is a mystery.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>No reaction?</p><br/><p>In other words, she hasn\u2019t answered the calls of the Church or the heroes?</p><br/><p>The attack to the capital\u2026I see, it is around the time when that Goddess met with those Gods.</p><br/><p>Did they make some sort of agreement that\u2019s making her unable to move?</p><br/><p>I have not been told the details of it, so\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have done a strange talk as well, but yeah. Tentatively speaking, I would like to eliminate the influence and distortion of the Goddess, and having you know that is plenty enough for today.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt sounds like you feel it will be in a pretty far future though.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>A long time after we die, that is.</p><br/><p>Maybe that\u2019s why I felt Senpai so distant.</p><br/><p>The objectives that Senpai shoulders are not things that she always tries to resolve herself.</p><br/><p>She resolves them bit by bit, and if it isn\u2019t possible with her, she places that job to the future generation.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are a race that can transfer their feelings, you know. By doing that, we are able to turn time into our allies as well. Trying to do everything by yourself in your own era can bring about pointless pain and can distort your objective.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat you have decided to do yourself should be accomplished by oneself. I think that\u2019s something splendid. Time can fade memories, and there\u2019s no assurance that the next generation will hold the same feelings as you after all.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you won\u2019t think about moving as a whole\u2026you won\u2019t believe in this world\u2019s society as you act huh.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cJust like how Senpai taught me, in my foundation, there\u2019s most likely some discriminating feelings towards hyumans. I think that\u2019s what it means to understand the words, but being unable to accept it. Even if Senpai tells me to believe in their change, I just can\u2019t. Sorry.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026It isn\u2019t something that can be immediately eliminated right after understanding it. It isn\u2019t something you need to apologize for either. From now on, I will be counting on you as a customer of yours, Makoto-kun.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes\u2026here as well.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>We look close, but Senpai and I are distant.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t want to know of it, but I ended up knowing it.</p><br/><p>This is different from the disgust I felt towards Tomoki, like a disparity of not wanting something like this to happen.</p><br/><p>Senpai accepts the current world of that Goddess.</p><br/><p>On top of that, she is trying to tell the world about this sense of discomfort and trying to change it slowly.</p><br/><p>She is aware that it will take an enormous amount of time.</p><br/><p>Without caring about those kind of things, I am thinking that it is natural for me to want to have the Goddess reflect as soon as possible and have the hyumans and demi-humans enter an equal relationship.</p><br/><p>Without caring about how much or how many consequences it might bring.</p><br/><p>From this world and this Goddess\u2019 perspective\u2026I probably do look like a fiendish terrorist\u2026</p><br/><p>Even so, if I can simply find a method to return to my world in a desirable way, I think I would act.</p><br/><p>For the sake of fighting once with the Goddess.</p><br/><p>I wonder, if that time comes, will I end up fighting Senpai?</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t think a fight against that person and me will come to a conclusion, but if possible, I would want to avoid having Senpai point a sword at me.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

His eyes were going through the mountain of papers that were piled up on his desk.</p><br/><p>With his left hand, he took the papers, and with his right hand, he holds a pen he uses to write sometimes.</p><br/><p>It goes without saying that what he is currently pondering in his head is about the information of Aion kingdom and Tsige.</p><br/><p>And this is the most recent information he has received from the eyes and ears that Rembrandt company has placed in the several areas.</p><br/><p>Of course, there\u2019s always new information coming to his place everyday.</p><br/><p>In this moment when they are trying to take advantage of the revolution to gain independence in Tsige, he is technically the central figure, so he has been living days where sleep is precious.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Fumu. There\u2019s still rough areas but\u2026the path has been made.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>If this were the representative of Kuzunoha company, he would have already been drowned in information a long time ago and escaped from reality with this amount of work.</p><br/><p>It is an amount that even if a miracle happens, arranging it all would be his limit.</p><br/><p>But Rembrandt who has his wit and experience, secures a small amount of sleep everyday by properly grasping the situation, and has already finished his insight regarding the revolution of Aion kingdom and independence of Tsige.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are being quite cautious.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Well well, I am astonished. To think that you were someone who didn\u2019t show any manners when entering a room, I really didn\u2019t expect that.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems to be called a \u2018surprise\u2019. I learned this from Raidou-sama.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sudden visitor responded to the sarcasm of Rembrandt who was pointing out her lack of common sense.</p><br/><p>It is certainly true that visiting late at night without any prior appointment is quite rude.</p><br/><p>It is not something that can be forgiven by just saying it is a surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think that will make me consent, Sairitz-sama? Coming late at night without even knocking, and obviously, no appointment. That\u2019s nothing but a trespasser.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. I apologize for the rudeness. I am truly sorry. But, don\u2019t you think that we should get to know each other more, Patrick-sama?\u201d (Sairitz)</p><br/><p>The young woman that\u2019s called Sairitz, warded off the the sharp gaze and words of Rembrandt, and gave him a flirtatious glance with a glossy tone.</p><br/><p>She is from the a neighboring country of Aion, Lorel Union, moreover, a person in an influential position.</p><br/><p>Thinking about her position, she is currently taking an unbelievably dangerous action.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think you already understand what we both need though.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Rembrandt didn\u2019t break his usual attitude.</p><br/><p>He simply waits for the next words of Sairitz.</p><br/><p>\u201cAra, even though you are going to be doing the same shrewd acts you committed in the past, you are being quiet frank. It seems like the image I knew of you is slightly different now.\u201d (Sairitz)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou intend to show me the power of Lorel Union\u2019s information gathering, and place pressure on me? Even if I show the ability I had in the past, it would be unnatural to maintain the same personality as that time. You have already investigated that much, so don\u2019t joke around.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou only have eyes for your wife and daughter huh. I can\u2019t help but view this as strange in my eyes. Matching your history and personality, it may be slight, but it feels like something is out of place. We are in a relationship where we will become comrades. I wouldn\u2019t do something like this just because of a small sense of discomfort of mine. That\u2019s one of the reasons of my invitation just now though.\u201d (Sairitz)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are saying that if we were to unite our bodies, we would be able to trust each other? Well\u2026I will admit that it is a valid method when in a complicity. But that\u2019s a delusion that only works between one individual and the other. It is not something I would expect the empress of Lorel would do at all.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe scale of this matter is way too big to apply. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s making you so impatient, but if you need someone to consult with, depending on the case, I might be able to help.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201cGood grief. I have been incredibly hurt as a woman, but I now understand that you truly love your wife and family. Even if I knew that my objective would be achieved no matter where the dice rolled, it still hurts. I will restrain from doing so in the future.\u201d (Sairitz)</p><br/><p>Sairitz speaks out words that can be taken as giving up.</p><br/><p>It was an attitude that one can tell that the discomfort she had of Rembrandt inside her head had vanished.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeriously. If my wife were to have even slight suspicions about it, my daily life would become the worst. You seem to have already noticed, but I would like you to completely stop these kind of methods that only bring risks to me.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>While sighing, Rembrandt reprimanded the behaviour of Saritz.</p><br/><p>It can\u2019t be helped.</p><br/><p>Late at night, in the room where he is supposed to be doing work and already had his butler leave, there\u2019s a young woman.</p><br/><p>It is clearly a situation that\u2019s unprofitable for the man.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis matter is incredibly important for Lorel as well after all. Even if it is my personal impression, I still wanted to confirm the uncertain factor I felt. I am in a situation where I can\u2019t even touch the highest uncertain factor which is the Kuzunoha company you see.\u201d (Sairitz)</p><br/><p>\u201cKuzunoha and Raidou-dono are quite simple existences. It is not like I don\u2019t understand how you feel, but those guys return sincerity with sincerity, and fang with fang. They move with a truly simple logic.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are times when it is fearsome not knowing just how far that simple logic can go. Especially for someone like me who is involved with the health of my country.\u201d (Sairitz)</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it probably can go real far. It is truly a nice sensation.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201cAs a person that follows the religion of the Goddess, and serves the Spirits, this is something someone like you can\u2019t understand.\u201d (Sairitz)</p><br/><p>This time, Sairitz was the one who sighed, and then returned words of criticism at Rembrandt.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha! You can\u2019t understand huh. And yet, you have offered cooperation and are trying to make the Kuzunoha company owe you. You said before that it didn\u2019t matter where it rolled, but with that kind of principle in your actions, you still possess this much ability in making decisions. You are truly a fearsome one.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201cNot as much as you. Even if you had to discard your everything, the common sense that you believed in, you concentrated on Raidou-dono. That\u2019s truly the borderline of madness.\u201d (Sairitz)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo no. Contrary to expectations, we might actually be more similar than you think. That\u2019s why, leaving aside trust, I am able to believe in you. I highly value that stubbornness of yours, and I can believe in your judgment as well.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I also\u2026believe in your madness\u2026and the conviction that supports it. That conviction of never betraying Kuzunoha company no matter what happens. That\u2019s why someone like me,who wants to avoid confronting them, is able to believe in you.\u201d (Sairitz)</p><br/><p>\u201cSeriously. In other words, there\u2019s absolutely no problems. We\u2026\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2018Can form a good relationship\u2019, right?\u201d (Sairitz)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood. I am sorry for interrupting your silent night. I once again apologize, Patrick-sama.\u201d (Sairitz)</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mind it. Next time, I ask that you make a proper appointment beforehand, but I will welcome you. Ah right. Since we have the chance, is it okay to ask you one other thing?\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. Ask me.\u201d (Sairitz)</p><br/><p>\u201cI had some slight doubts regarding your actions and proposal you see. I wonder, just what kind of existence is a priestess for you?\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026So you went for that.\u201d (Sairitz)</p><br/><p>\u201cBeing one-sidedly shown the information gathering abilities of Lorel, felt unfair you see.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>Rembrandt obviously had gathered information of Sairitz as well.</p><br/><p>Saying: \u2018Regarding your actions and proposal\u2019, was only an excuse.</p><br/><p>It is because he had gathered information of Sairitz that he felt doubts about her.</p><br/><p>Rembrandt had questioned her about one of them.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026For me, that personage is\u2026\u201d (Sairitz)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2018That personage is\u2026\u2019\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201cA sister, a daughter, and also a monarch as well. No\u2026that\u2019s not it.\u201d (Sairitz)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The words that were slowly tied together by Sairitz, Rembrandt waited for them in silence.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe is most likely\u2026someone that we\u2026want to protect no matter what.\u201d (Sairitz)</p><br/><p>And then, the revised words of hers made the eyes of Rembrandt show a light of surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cHoh~. For the empress, the priestess is obviously an important existence, but when I probed into it, I thought she was an existence that could be replaced.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201cReplaced? It is certainly true that it is essentially that way. But for me, she is the only priestess. Fufu, that\u2019s an answer that would make people question my position as empress. Please keep this a secret.\u201d (Sairitz)</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. Even so, I see. With this, I have also cleared a few of my doubts I held about you. I was able to make this time profitable for me as well. This is something to be happy about.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great to hear. Well then, have a good night.\u201d (Sairitz)</p><br/><p>\u201cDream well.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>Sairitz left the same way she came in, without making a single sound.</p><br/><p>Silence returns to the room once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuh~. Being in the border of madness applies to both of us. If the basis for her judgment is the safety of the \u2018present age\u2019 priestess, I can understand that heavy bias of hers. This was an unexpected harvest.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>He mutters in this room where only he remains now.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you lack consideration for the priestess, your neck might be taken in your sleep; but if we turn it around, it also means that if you are not negligent in your consideration to the priestess, you can believe in that empress as long as it is within acceptable bounds. It is truly a grateful thing that it has become a lot more easy to grasp her true motives.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>When Rembrandt received an offer of cooperation from the empress of Lorel, he was obviously incredibly cautious.</p><br/><p>Of course, he still hasn\u2019t released the necessary amount of cautiousness towards Sairitz.</p><br/><p>However, now that he was able to grasp a part of Sairitz\u2019 principle of actions, he is able to understand her moves.</p><br/><p>It was a big step forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, \u2018no matter where it rolls\u2019 huh. It is true that in this matter, there\u2019s definitely not going to be any losses for Lorel. It is a truly ingenious choice of positioning. That woman would have done pretty well as a merchant too. If a bureaucrat like that existed to a certain extent in this country as well\u2026is something I do wonder, seriously.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, there\u2019s no doubt that Sairitz is not an imprudent person at all.</p><br/><p>She is dependable and can work as a good partner. That\u2019s the kind of person she is, is what Rembrandt once again recognized of her.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways, I have done what I had to do. I also got my chance to brag. Now, I just have to continuously choose the thin but correct path. That\u2019s all I can do in what\u2019s left after all\u2026\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>In order to not regret it, he wrings out his everything.</p><br/><p>Before the light of the room went out, the last words of Rembrandt were packed with those kind of emotions.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6</p><br/><p>-The night a few days after the renewal of Kuzunoha company.</p><br/><p>In the Rembrandt store, there\u2019s an amount of merchants gathered there that can\u2019t be compared to any time before.</p><br/><p>For people that deal in trades at Tsige, an invitation from Rembrandt is in essence, the same as a forced summon.</p><br/><p>Moreover, in the wording of that invitation, there\u2019s a part that says: \u2018if possible, make sure it is the representative coming\u2019. That\u2019s the kind of event tonight.</p><br/><p>In the fancy hall, there\u2019s cooking that didn\u2019t lose in splendor.</p><br/><p>Looking at this, there were many merchants who didn\u2019t have a good color in their face.</p><br/><p>\u201cOi, Raidou is also here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s obvious, right? It hasn\u2019t been long since he has made his store. He can\u2019t just instantly return to Rotsgard after that. No matter if he is the favorite of Rembrandt-san.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat. So he already intends to curry favor? He changes gears as quickly as always huh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are one to say.\u201d</p><br/><p>A number of people were sending gazes and talking in a low voice about Raidou who was having a friendly chat in the hall.</p><br/><p>They were puzzled as to why Raidou, who didn\u2019t attend to the meetings from the Tsige merchants, was now in this place, and they were also displeased by it.</p><br/><p>In other words, a group that didn\u2019t hold a good impression of Kuzunoha company.</p><br/><p>In terms of percent, it is about a 20-30% of the people here.</p><br/><p>They are also people that pursued to do business in this town, hold ambitions, are young, and have a slight amount of talent without being blessed by enough good opportunities.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, even so, I am being thoroughly defeated by Milliono company lately. Can\u2019t do anything at all, seriously.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFortunately, we are being well treated by the guild and the adventurers. But the reason why there has been a good wind blowing to our side as well\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected, because we are having a good relationship with Rembrandt company?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that the same for everyone? I feel like there\u2019s a different wind blowing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Hoh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI would like to get along with Raidou from now on as well. There\u2019s no need for us to crush each other, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt would be great if you were to tell us how.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. It is pretty easy. I will also be teaching you a rule that you must keep no matter what. Listen well. Try having a sincere relationship with Kuzunoha company.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuzunoha?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man lowered his voice and was talking with someone that was a business rival in the past.</p><br/><p>In the hall where groups of people have been formed here and there, this is one of the conversations that continues within it.</p><br/><p>Everyone had a trait that they shared in common.</p><br/><p>That from the companies that have been facing a radical growth, the people here are the centre of them.</p><br/><p>Those people had grouped with their planned people, and were speaking about things they had planned beforehand.</p><br/><p>The name of Kuzunoha company.</p><br/><p>Normally, they would suspect the scheme of the other party.</p><br/><p>But tonight, the circumstances are a bit different.</p><br/><p>The person that\u2019s doing the conversation and the person that opened the conversation, knew that there\u2019s something backing the Kuzunoha company.</p><br/><p>And different from the budding younglings, they also know that Rembrandt is in essence, the one that has a hold of this town.</p><br/><p>Kuzunoha company has recently opened a store with unbelievable scale.</p><br/><p>Of course, this can\u2019t be made possible without support from their surroundings.</p><br/><p>It is hard to believe that this was done by a young representative that doesn\u2019t even stay in town for much. But Rembrandt even changed the name of a Street for his sake.</p><br/><p>It was a nailed down truth.</p><br/><p>\u201cT-Then, are you saying that the land the Eleor company was holding onto\u2026was in order to present it to Raidou?\u201d </p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Well, it was a gamble knowing it would be of high profit, but\u2026he build a store of that scale. Everyone, do you understand?\u201d (Eleor representative)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Honestly\u2026that\u2019s one joke I can\u2019t laugh at.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is indeed someone that\u2019s been doing well in this town, but there\u2019s no way he would have enough savings to make something of that scale. That means he is gaining quite a lot in Rotsgard as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI only know about selling and buying land, but Raidou-dono payed the full amount when he did the deal. It is a truly unusual way of buying.\u201d (Eleor representative)</p><br/><p>\u201cSeiously?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA plot of land of that extend? Rather than calling it unusual, it is impossible.\u201d</p><br/><p>At a place slightly separated, the representative of Eleor company was also doing a similar conversation.</p><br/><p>Both representatives from the Milliono and Eleor companies were told by Rembrandt to create a deep connection with Raidou for the sake of the future.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no doubt that their deep connection with Rembrandt company has played a big role in their recent success.</p><br/><p>The people that are in this group right now are the merchants that serve as the backbone of Tsige, and they are people that Rembrandt has been paying a reasonable amount of attention to.</p><br/><p>Rembrandt had judged that even if it\u2019s slightly late, they would be bringing Raidou\u2019s topic into the conversations.</p><br/><p>Looking at it as a whole, there\u2019s around 30% of younglings here that don\u2019t think of Raidou in a good light and were invited today into this gathering.</p><br/><p>Also, there\u2019s special companies that fulfill a low amount of demands, and private companies that don\u2019t really hold much ambition; in short, there\u2019s currently around 40% of people in this place that don\u2019t hold much interest in Kuzunoha.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s people that differ in the type of industry and people that have different type of customers, so even if they are in the same Tsige, it is natural that there\u2019s a lot of companies that have practically no connection with Kuzunoha company.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Fuh.\u201d (Raidou)</p><br/><p>Loosening the necktie that he is not used to wearing, Raidou takes one glass from the waiter, and gets some rest in a place slightly faraway.</p><br/><p>There were many gazes that were concerned about his movements, but they were holding back and no one tried to approach him.</p><br/><p>In a place where there\u2019s gazes on him, Raidou couldn\u2019t show an unsightly behaviour.</p><br/><p>He had relaxed while knowing the limits of how much.</p><br/><p>\u201cAround this time, Rembrandt-san is probably doing the last confirmation with the long standing shops huh.\u201d (Raidou)</p><br/><p>Around 10% of the merchants in the hall are representatives that have been doing business for a long time in Tsige.</p><br/><p>Those people have been able to cope with the town\u2019s prosperity, and have been able to maintain their power without defaming their name.</p><br/><p>In title and in public, they are side by side with Rembrandt. In other words, there\u2019s a good amount of companies that are at the top.</p><br/><p>Soon after being invited, they were led into a separate room by the Rembrandt company, and for now, they have only been able to see who are the people present.</p><br/><p>Today, Rembrandt was planning on revealing the movements of Aion kingdom to the merchants.</p><br/><p>That means the phase of laying the groundwork has already passed.</p><br/><p>But well, the standing of Kuzunoha company and Lorel Union\u2019s participation won\u2019t be disclosed though.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Raidou held in the sigh that he was going to let out and fixes his attire.</p><br/><p>And then, after emptying the glass he had in his hand, he returned to the hall.</p><br/><p>It is time.</p><br/><p>A few minutes after he returned to the place where the merchants are gathered, tonight\u2019s host: Patrick Rembrandt, had appeared with the big shots that everyone knows of, and the atmosphere in the place made a complete change.</p><br/><p>Seeing that the amount of people appearing here were the same as the people that entered the separate room, Raidou slightly furrowed his brows.</p><br/><p>Because even if he had heard from Rembrandt that he has been speaking with those people to a certain extent since a while back, it was still kind of hard to believe that he was really able to convince everyone.</p><br/><p>But well, in the eyes of Raidou, Rembrandt is a flawless hyuman.</p><br/><p>Rather than thinking about the details of the confidential talk they had, Raidou simply held amazement towards Rembrandt.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Now then.\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>Saying his thanks for accepting the invitation, voicing out words that praised each merchant for the prosperity of Tsige, and finishing all of that general talk, a sharp light appeared in the eyes of Rembrandt, and he began the real talk.</p><br/><p>\u201cSadly, it has become a certainty that the fire of revolution will be burning in Aion kingdom. How will you\u2026how will we move?\u201d (Rembrandt)</p><br/><p>With a questioning tone, Rembrandt\u2019s speech began.</p><br/><p>The revolution in Aion.</p><br/><p>Tsige\u2019s independence.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t think it will come true, but if possible\u2026I pray that the kingdom, the empire, and the demon race don\u2019t get involved in this matter.\u201d (Raidou)</p><br/><p>Feeling that the words of Rembrandt were bringing heat into the hall, Raidou muttered this.</p><br/><p>Because he already felt that they would definitely get involved in it as well.</p><br/><p>This mutter was not because he didn\u2019t have the resolve, but because he had already resolved himself.</p><br/><p>Just how many ripples will this revolution create?</p><br/><p>This was something that not even the Goddess could predict its outcome.</p><br/><p>TLN: This marks the ending of Arc 4!</p><br/><p>For people that want to know, there\u2019s still 40 chapters more to go.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

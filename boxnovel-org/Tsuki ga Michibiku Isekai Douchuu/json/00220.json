We have confirmed it as well. Just that, the description was strangely ornated, and the result after investigating about this ritual and aria that felt like it was disguised, we learned that it was a summoning spell for a different realm.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cMoreover, it was a formula that didn\u2019t require the aria, the necessary tools, catalysts, and the sacrifices. It was a spell formation that was quite different from its description, so we thought we should report it to Waka-sama.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>I see.</p><br/><p>The first possibility I can think of is a misprint, but it seems like it is not the case this time.</p><br/><p>It was in the library of a Superior Dragon after all.</p><br/><p>In the first place, Waterfall seemed to be the diligent type, and she did give off the feeling like she was trying to avoid me, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s merits for her in deceiving me.</p><br/><p>If this were Root, he would pop a cracker and say: \u2018you got it right!\u2019 and bring out a second problem.</p><br/><p>The other possibility I can think of is\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026So it means\u2026that this is a summoning to call someone that can return the summoner to their world?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Why is it that I don\u2019t feel that good about this?</p><br/><p>\u201cI think it is appropriate to conclude that.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how we think as well.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>So this is the right answer huh.</p><br/><p>It is also something expected.</p><br/><p>Of course, I did suspect that there was the chance the explanation of the ritual was a lie.</p><br/><p>We don\u2019t have a precedent that has tried out this, so it can\u2019t be helped.</p><br/><p>Is the ritual itself a lie, or is something coming out from it?</p><br/><p>At the very least, there\u2019s the chance that something could come out, so Tomoe and Shiki are on guard about that.</p><br/><p>If it is something that these two can handle themselves, they would have already summoned it and continued with their investigation after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so, there\u2019s the chance that something bad might come out, so you decided to report it to me first, right?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>By the way, the only ones here are Tomoe, Shiki, and I.</p><br/><p>It seems like Mio went to prepare savory egg custards for me since I supposedly muttered about that in my sleep.</p><br/><p>She seemed to be pretty hyped about it.</p><br/><p>I just muttered it, so I don\u2019t think she would become like that just because of it. I probably did something else aside from that.</p><br/><p>I like savory egg custards, so if she is going to prepare them, I am happy though.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Let me say this first but, if we are to do it, I think something incredibly troublesome will be coming.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cRight.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is Waka-sama after all.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>What an instant answer.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026No wait, at that part, shouldn\u2019t you at least make it less straight?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cWaka has been picking up trouble as if you have been aiming at them from the beginning after all.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are times when you even surpass the expected worst case scenario. If that was the luck of the world, it wouldn\u2019t be a laughing matter.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cC-Calling it the epitome of worst is not a laughing matter either though.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cFortunately, Waka possesses toughness that can narrowly brush away those problems laughing.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>They are truly saying whatever they want.</p><br/><p>Even so, I have a strange luck to draw out the lowest of rates.</p><br/><p>I feels like these rates are biased.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s definitely going to be a moment when something good happens, so I am not hung up on those things every time it happens.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, since you guys say it is a summoning spell, wanna try calling it to see? We could ask about how to return and stuff like that.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat should we do about the cost?\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe cost huh. Hm\u2026 It would be hard to gather one thousand people unless we pick some in a battlefield somewhere.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>The easiest way would be to kidnap people from a place where they are killing each other.</p><br/><p>The sacrifices will be dying, so buying slaves for that would not leave a good taste.</p><br/><p>Different from soldiers and mercenaries, there are a lot of slaves that don\u2019t have the resolve to throw away their lives.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it is someone that words can get through, there might not be the need to prepare the sacrifices, but it is practically as if the person itself is requesting it beforehand, so it is possible that we would be angering that person if we don\u2019t.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s true.</p><br/><p>It is written that there\u2019s the need to prepare it in this way in order to return to your former world, so if there\u2019s plans on doing the ritual, there\u2019s the need to prepare for it.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, the place to do the ritual is also a problem. Should we do it in Asora, or would it be better to do it outside?\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>Ah, there\u2019s also that.</p><br/><p>Since we are doing something big, it might catch the eye of the Goddess.</p><br/><p>She has been strangely docile lately, but that doesn\u2019t mean she is harmless.</p><br/><p>She has a danger level and pain level of a first-class noxious bug.</p><br/><p>Just that, it all depends on the indulgence of the other side and if the sacrifices have to be taken, so it would be better to do it in a suitable place.</p><br/><p>Or more like, I can\u2019t do something like this in Asora.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we want to avoid the eyes of third parties, it would be Asora. This place hasn\u2019t been found by the Goddess yet. But the sacrifices are the problem.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. But why the need of sacrifices? I want to confirm if other things can be used, so it is the truth that it would give more peace of mind if it is in Asora rather than the outside where there\u2019s the chance of someone seeing it.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Because if the matter is related to magic power, I have plenty to throw.</p><br/><p>If there\u2019s no need for them to be people, then\u2026I can just go to the wasteland and Kaleneon to mass capture mamonos.</p><br/><p>If what\u2019s clear is that the aria is a simple summoning spell, we can call it and confirm if it is actually a requirement in order to call it to this world.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026It is not possible to call an existence higher than the Goddess, so if Waka prepares himself, the safest bet would be to try in Asora.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Eh?</p><br/><p>Tomoe said something important as if nothing.</p><br/><p>My resolve of trying in Asora hardened in an instant.</p><br/><p>\u201cAn existence higher than the Goddess won\u2019t come?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Repeating her words, I confirm it with Tomoe once more.</p><br/><p>I was internally scared that something like that trio of Gods might come out from this.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe aria itself completes the process of the ritual composition. If someone in this world were to call an existence that surpasses the Goddess, there will definitely be a mechanism in the aria where it would ask for the permission of the Goddess first.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u2026I see.</p><br/><p>In that case, there\u2019s no need to worry about it so much huh.</p><br/><p>Since the upper limit is something that\u2019s lower than the Goddess.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s do it in Asora. Just in case, at a place far from the town. We can have Tomoe and Mio protect the two towns.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>The two of them possess abilities fit for defense, so they are suitable for the job.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can have Serwhale protect the sea. Mio can protect the first town, and I would be able to accompany you.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s unexpected.</p><br/><p>Does that mean she is worried about me?</p><br/><p>Serwhale and the other sea races have pretty high defensive ability when they have the sea as their backing.</p><br/><p>Even if their defensive power is not on the level of Mio, it is certainly true that they can be trusted.</p><br/><p>If we were to classify Tomoe in defensive or offensive, it would be more of the defensive type though.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s unexpected. Is it because you have investigated it, so you want to witness it until the end?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Something like that.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood. It seems like my help will be needed if anything happens, so you being there will make things easier.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, leave it to me.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cShiki, how much can you prepare?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have already done the necessary preparations, so the only thing that\u2019s left is to do the aria. We have done the preparations in a place far away from the town, so it will take us time to move there though.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected of you guys. There wasn\u2019t the need of me asking.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>They have already done the preparations.</p><br/><p>With how things went, they probably prepared one outside as well just in case.</p><br/><p>My respects.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6</p><br/><p>There\u2019s an ominous gate right in front of me that I would agree if it were called the Hell\u2019s Gate.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know about the material it is made of, but it looks bony.</p><br/><p>It is a double door, and at the top of the gate, an expressionless face is placed there.</p><br/><p>The height is that of a 2 story building.</p><br/><p>In other words, it is pretty big.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn a sense, this is pretty easy to understand. I can see it as a gate to move between worlds.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what it looks like.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>I got the agreement of Tomoe.</p><br/><p>But well, it is not like anything will change with that.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no followers of mine that would say this is of good taste, or that this is a fresh look for a gate, so I know that nothing will change much even if I got the response of someone.</p><br/><p>We are currently at a wide grass-covered plain no race is living in.</p><br/><p>This kind of place can be found in many parts of Asora.</p><br/><p>We can even make explosion SFX scenes here.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut since it has responded to the call, this is most likely a gate with a will. We can\u2019t let our guards down.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>Shiki is serious.</p><br/><p>Even without being told, with a gate like this, even I wouldn\u2019t let my guard down.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026This is the first time I have come to this place. It is a world that\u2019s different from any of the worlds that have spread my spell formation. But\u2026\u201d (???)</p><br/><p>Okay. I can clearly understand what he is saying.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s question him.</p><br/><p>\u201cNice to meet you. I am the one that called you here.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cA mortal huh. Also\u2026an undead, and a dragon. No, it is vaguely different. Mutated ones? Doesn\u2019t seem to be the case. I see, you have received the ruling pact huh.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I thought, the face at the top is speaking.</p><br/><p>It is slightly tiring on my neck, but well, that\u2019s fine.</p><br/><p>It seems like he is thinking, so maybe I should wait for a bit?</p><br/><p>Ah, now that I think about it, I haven\u2019t introduced myself.</p><br/><p>Raidou -no, it is fine to use my real name.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy name is Misumi Makoto. The ones here are my followers: Tomoe and Shiki. If it\u2019s okay with you, can I hear your name?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Samal. But in the first place, for us, there\u2019s no point in names. By the way, where are the offerings?\u201d (Samal)</p><br/><p>Offerings. The thousand lives huh.</p><br/><p>It came immediately huh.</p><br/><p>\u201cSamal-san, regarding that, why do you require the lives of a thousand?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt should have been written that it is necessary in the spell, right? Since we are here face-to-face, your side should have consented to that.\u201d (Samal)</p><br/><p>\u201cWe were told that this was a ritual to return a person, that has been summoned, to their original world. But when we investigated it, the ritual composition was a simple summoning spell, and so, for the sake of learning about it in more detail, we decided to call you here.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t answer my question, but let\u2019s go in a patient manner here.</p><br/><p>At the very least, the presence this fellow gives is less than the one I felt from that Goddess and Athena-sama.</p><br/><p>Instead of saying the pressure is weak, it is more like the wave it is giving off is calm. Well, it is something extremely subjective anyways.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026If I didn\u2019t hear you wrong, it sounded like you said: you called me as a test.\u201d (Salma)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe outline is correct. I thought that it would be an existence we could talk in this way, so I thought negotiations would be possible.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like I have been heavily underestimated here. But, it seems like there\u2019s enough lives here for one thousand. The quality is pretty good too. It can be covered plenty enough huh.\u201d (Samal)</p><br/><p>It was able to grasp the numbers of the Asora residents?</p><br/><p>If it turns into a fight so soon, I honestly won\u2019t be able to ask him anything.</p><br/><p>From what I see, it is probably a special ability.</p><br/><p>In that case, it is pointless to ask?</p><br/><p>No, it is not like we can\u2019t create a good relationship here.</p><br/><p>\u201cI first want to hear if you actually need the sacrifice of a thousand though.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do I need to tell a rascal like you?\u201d (Samal)</p><br/><p>Uh, it is the natural haughtiness that\u2019s pretty popular between God-like existences.</p><br/><p>I was thinking about suppressing him if he were to rampage, so I might be considered haughty as well though.</p><br/><p>I feel a bad atmosphere from my front.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Both of my sides were dyed in a turbulent atmosphere as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was wondering if it can be resolved with magic power or something like that.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cMagic power? Are you an idiot? What good would come from taking the magic power of others? There\u2019s no way it would serve as a substitute for life, for the souls. A fool that doesn\u2019t understand the machinations of magic power, how was it possible for someone like that to get his hands on the magic formation to call me?\u201d (Samal)</p><br/><p>\u201cIdiot\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFool\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I thought that magic power was almighty or something like that, but it seems like it is not.</p><br/><p>Sacrifices are already on the realm of the occult, so I thought that magic power which is practically on that same line would work in a lot of things though.</p><br/><p>Like the magma pond in Kaleneon.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, are the life of mamonos and plants counted as well?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026You have no saving. If it is not souls with strong desires, there\u2019s no point. In other words, it has to be *mortals*, or a life that is closely related to mortals. Barely scraping would be until beast races.\u201d (Samal) </p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In that case, it would be troublesome to gather them.</p><br/><p>Even though Waterfall went through the trouble of showing me this knowledge, it might become a fruitless effort.</p><br/><p>If there\u2019s the need of sacrifices in order for Samal-san to show his power, I would need a thousand lives in order to go back and fro.</p><br/><p>It is not a realistic thing to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom what I see, you are quite the novelty. And it is not the first time I have met this presence.\u201d (Samal)</p><br/><p>He is someone I know?</p><br/><p>I haven\u2019t had any experiences with speaking gates in my whole life.</p><br/><p>I have gotten used to speaking with a lot of things, but if it were in my time in Japan, it would be at a level to leave a trauma.</p><br/><p>It is a matter of course since an eerie gate that can speak would come out from who knows where after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I think this is our first time meeting.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, I am not so free you see. I will overlook the deficiency of sacrifices. I will gather them from the vicinity and end it there. But Misumi Makoto, I won\u2019t be cooperating with you. You didn\u2019t compel with the contract after all. Be grateful that I didn\u2019t punish you at the very least.\u201d (Samal)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat would trouble me. I can\u2019t overlook that.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026You bastard, even after carefreely calling a deity like me, you will obstruct my actions that came from your own inadequacy? Ritual, contract, agreement; get that into your head.\u201d (Samal)</p><br/><p>It was a God?</p><br/><p>It is my first time hearing the name Samal.</p><br/><p>No idea what myth this God is from.</p><br/><p>If it is a myth that\u2019s not from Earth, I wouldn\u2019t know in the first place.</p><br/><p>\u201cI just thought about negotiating the goods that we would be contributing from both sides.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cRecall in exchange for sacrifices. Isn\u2019t that pretty clear?\u201d (Samal)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe information about the recall is practically shrouded in darkness. Then wouldn\u2019t it be obvious that we would want to ask about the thousand sacrifices as well?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t perform the ritual in the first place. \u2018Ask and you will be answered\u2019, a naive thinking like that doesn\u2019t even work in the society of mankind either.\u201d (Samal)</p><br/><p>Uh.</p><br/><p>Well, I do think it is the responsibility of both sides to read the agreements of the contract.</p><br/><p>But a part of the utilization in the goods is completely dark, so it can\u2019t be helped you know.</p><br/><p>If it were the export of a top-secret military weapon, it would be one thing. Maybe teleporting between worlds\u2026is a pretty incredible technique?</p><br/><p>Even so, having a thousand gulped in a black box is just\u2026</p><br/><p>Yeah.</p><br/><p>The sound-looking argument of the gate is harsh.</p><br/><p>\u201cWaka, doesn\u2019t seem like the other party wants to talk. I think it would be better to have him fix his attitude first.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Tomoe, is that something you say while unsheathing your katana?</p><br/><p>\u201cWaka-sama, it is unproductive to keep company to something like a speaking gate. Don\u2019t worry, I will show you that we can get the information Waka-sama wants even if he is wreck.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>Shiki, you are talking as if destroying it is already settled.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you can\u2019t even discipline your retainers huh. Makoto, truly a foolish\u2026hm? I see, it is you.\u201d (Samal)</p><br/><p>The gaze of Samal-san was in Tomoe and Shiki, and then returns to me.</p><br/><p>What is it?</p><br/><p>\u201cI remember now. It was at the time when I was summoned before. It was a request from a certain Goddess, if I remember correctly, it was\u2026right, a hyuman. She asked me to help out in bringing two failures of humans called \u2018hyuman\u2019 to the original world.\u201d (Samal)</p><br/><p>?</p><br/><p>Two hyumans?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are the child of those two, right? So that\u2019s why you had a presence I found familiar. Hmph, I see. That Goddess really likes playing around with dolls, but\u2026\u201d (Samal)</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>A despising gaze incomparable to any he gave before was poured down on me.</p><br/><p>The child of those two?</p><br/><p>Is he referring to my mom and dad?</p><br/><p>Hey, does that mean\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cEven the peasant disposition is inherited huh. Trying to bend the vow in a ritual after the deal, that\u2019s truly the thought of a failure.\u201d (Samal)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He knows about the moment when mom and dad transferred worlds.</p><br/><p>Also, did he say peasant?</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t feel like it was a word directed only at me.</p><br/><p>That means\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you have inherited the blood of the residents of that distorted world, it is a given that your brain is lacking huh. That Goddess, in the end, she send those two to the most harshest of worlds with the lowest survival rate -the Origin world. I didn\u2019t care about who and where I send them, so I didn\u2019t say anything though. A God is a guest of honor that\u2019s better than souls after all. Umu, those two abandoned the world they were born in, went against God, and were single-mindedly pushing their own way of thinking. Truly hyuman-like.\u201d (Samal)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I could tell that Samal -this gate- is talking thrash about my parents.</p><br/><p>Of course, it felt like he was also insulting the Goddess as well\u2026but even so, this guy, speaking whatever it wants about mom and dad\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI see, I see. So you are the one the Goddess said? That matter about taking away something important of them one day. Meaning, you were the pawn that was being raised by those parents in order to throw away?!\u201d (Samal)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Shut up.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>My words leaked out.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s funny. A person that is running an errand for that Goddess, in a place like this, has tried to haggle regarding the sacrifices and is trying to cling onto me? After being thrown away by your blood parents, you still want to meet them?

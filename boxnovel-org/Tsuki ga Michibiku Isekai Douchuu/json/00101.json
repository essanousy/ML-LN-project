If anyone is willing to translate the POV chapters in the original web, that would be great. The POV chapters are the ones like the Ema and Tsukuyomi chapters where the view point is from someone different but in the same timeline.</p><br/><p>I really only want to concentrate on the main story right now, so if anyone is willing, please email me at [email\u00a0protected]</p><br/><p>Normally, Lime would have returned before the store\u2019s opening to clean, but he has yet to come back.</p><br/><p>Not only that, last night in the area where he was supposed to be, I found traces of a fight.</p><br/><p>Even though Akua and Eris came back as if nothing happened. Could it be he was the only one that went to that dangerous place? But I didn\u2019t receive such a report.</p><br/><p>I confirmed Rona-san\u2019s movements with Shiki, but it seems that last night there was no movements from her.</p><br/><p>\u201cLime-san said that he would visit the merchant guild later and after that return here though\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>\u201cThere were no orders of killing enemies and the fight looks unnatural. That person would first run. And then tail it\u201d (Akua)</p><br/><p>I have never given such an order before, Akua. Also, I don\u2019t have any intent to retort to your words anymore. It would be another story if they are thinking about doing war, but the Forest Onis are basically moving as an investigation corp. The site of the fight where Lime seems to have disappeared, is certainly on the way to the merchant guild where Lime and the two had separated. Even if he were suddenly attacked, he isn\u2019t so weak as to be defeated so easily. He would clash blades while trying to run away, then tail the enemy and report to me. That person is capable of that.</p><br/><p>In that case, it is hard to believe it but, there\u2019s the possibility that it was an opponent that didn\u2019t let him escape. Was there someone so capable that recently entered this land? If it\u2019s the pattern where a merchant employed them exclusively, then it wouldn\u2019t be strange that adventurers enter this town.</p><br/><p>Leaving the store to the dwarfs, we were at the second floor gathered up. We can only stay like this when we have urgent business. We can\u2019t have the dwarfs attending the store by themselves after all. I will have Akua and Eris return soon. In any case, if Lime was captured or defeated, then with the ability of these two, the chances of them being defeated as well is high.</p><br/><p>I think it is better for Shiki and me to be the ones mobilizing.</p><br/><p>That I can still stay calm even when Lime is in danger is, not because he is a hyuman and I don\u2019t care, but because after seeing the remains of the battle site, Shiki said that he is probably alive. Of course, I don\u2019t intend to just blindly believe that and search carefree. I intend to save him as fast as possible. Even if he didn\u2019t die in the battle, it doesn\u2019t mean that he is still okay. Just that, since he was kidnapped, it must mean that person has some sort of objective, so we should have time.</p><br/><p>\u201cRaidou-sama, it seems that we have probably been had\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 There were no movements from Rona-san right?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. But this situation matches with the story I heard before about the thought transmission jamming and the ring that suppresses blessings. A strange flow of power. It seems like he wasn\u2019t allowed to establish contact. This kind of technique, I think only demons can use it\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, that. So there are remains of it being used. There are a number of people who have infiltrated this lands aside from Rona-san and she used those hidden cards to pick a fight with us?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cI think there\u2019s that possibility. If it\u2019s her, she would be able to do things like that while having a handshake\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Is there anything else that can tell us his location?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cI have found the magic power of a person of interest. The Academy\u2019s librarian, Eva. For some reason, the magic power of her was in the scene\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>Eva-san. It is certainly a person I didn\u2019t expect. That isn\u2019t a place a librarian like her would be walking in the middle of the night.</p><br/><p>We are somewhat acquainted. But since the time I met her, she has only shown me her front as a librarian and Ruria\u2019s sister. In times it even feels unnatural. It looked like she was fond of rumors though.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t really feel any doubts of her. If there were any doubts, it would be when I first met her\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cEva-san huh. I don\u2019t think she would be able to catch Lime off guard, but if she was unrelated to the case and was killed because of her curiosity, then it would be pitiful\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>In the first place, that girl who likes to silently read books, has a strange attachment to rumors. But those kind of girls were in my high school as well. The type that has her antenna up the whole time. The type that would definitely get dragged into something in time.</p><br/><p>In the current state where we haven\u2019t shown a single one of our cards, I honestly don\u2019t feel like Rona-san would make a move though\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected, it isn\u2019t a situation where we can come to a conclusion yet. I also can\u2019t help but think that this is the work of demons. Let\u2019s have Akua and Eris return to the store while Raidou-sama and I try returning to the scene\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 You are right. Let\u2019s try going to the Academy\u2019s abandoned section\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>When Shiki proposed that idea, the phrase \u201cscene hundred times\u201d surfaced in my mind. Looking for traces of the culprit.</p><br/><p>The place where Lime disappeared, is in a street that extended from the Academy grounds to the Merchant Guild. The section was originally unused and it was a street with almost no uses, so the popularity of it was practically nil.</p><br/><p>But he was investigating the inside of the Academy grounds. The popular abandoned building that is no longer used. Correctly speaking, an area that has been scheduled for redevelopment and is prohibited the entry. If we are going to be investigating, that is the place to go to.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor now, let\u2019s begin from the actual spot. We might be able to find something new\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood. In that case, Akua and Eris return to the store. We will probably be late, so if there\u2019s any visitor, hear their business and tell them we will contact them at a later time\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cHave a safe trip\u201d</p><br/><p>Send off by the two employees, Shiki and I left to search for our disappeared comrade.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Are you okay, Ne-chan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear that from someone who just woke up. I am okay for now though\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am glad to hear that. And, can you please tell me the current situation?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was planning on releasing you who was defeated by that person. But a different group came after and I was treated as a comrade of yours. And, that\u2019s how it turned out like this. It is probably already morning. Unreported absence. Please give me a break\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, you were a librarian right? If I remember correctly, you said your name was Eva-san? Well, don\u2019t get so worried about being absent from work once or twice\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I messed up huh. To have been defeated, how pathetic. I don\u2019t have my katana either. I can\u2019t face Sis and Boss now\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Wait\u201d (Eva)</p><br/><p>\u201cAn?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you know my name? And even my job\u201d (Eva)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh. I am Lime Latte. An employee of Kuzunoha Company. You are an acquaintance of Raidou-sama right? In that case, I know at least your face. As an employee\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>While making a light self-introduction, my eyes finished grasping the surroundings. A prison. And judging from the confined air, this is underground. There\u2019s a sour smell and I can feel the presence of small beings all around the place. There\u2019s probably bugs crawling around. The persons in here are me and the librarian woman. This is the woman that Boss asked to investigate just in case. For now, I don\u2019t have any definitive proofs, but based on my intuition, this woman is planning something. I also don\u2019t know the reason why she was in such a place yesterday. It is at least not a route where people walk at night. She is trying to hide her uneasiness by maintaining a calm face, but she isn\u2019t that composed. It seems like this woman is weak to bugs. And yet, she is just clearing her ears and even when she feels their presence, she isn\u2019t distracted. I can\u2019t see disgust either. I can tell that she is quite uneasy on the inside.</p><br/><p>I check my whole body. The katana that was more important than my life and most of my equipment has been confiscated. Deciding that I should get them back at all cost, I confirm the equipment that is still fine. It seems like a number of items that the dwarf bros made for me are okay.</p><br/><p>So they didn\u2019t see it as dangerous huh. Or maybe they just considered them ornaments. But I can\u2019t call the ones who took my equipment as ill-prepared. Even I wouldn\u2019t find them dangerous in the past after all. The magic power is being concealed to the very limit and it isn\u2019t like I was hiding them or anything.</p><br/><p>The bangle in my right wrist. This is actually a weapon the dwarfs made. I voiced the small phrase that serves as a key.</p><br/><p>A faint and inconspicuous light wraps around the bangle and my right arm. In an instant, weight is felt in my hand. A sword materialized in my right hand.</p><br/><p>\u201c?! That is?!\u201d (Eva)</p><br/><p>\u201cShh\u2026 Don\u2019t talk so loud\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>I can understand her surprise. But I want her to at least think about the current situation. Right now, our interests should match. The interest of escaping from here that is.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, it is a lie that you are an employee right?\u201d (Eva)</p><br/><p>She must have felt something from my swinging gesture. The librarian looks at me with eyes of doubt. Yareyare, compared to that wicked man who captured Ne-san, I don\u2019t amount to much though. My winning ratio against Mondo has begun looking better recently. After this incident is over, I must train myself again.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmployees of my level are all around in Kuzunoha Company. Let me ask just in case but, Eva-san, you want to escape right?\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>N? Weird. She is wavering? What does that mean? Is it possible that this woman is related to the people that incarcerated me here? If it is an internal fight, then the story would be different but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 This place is the Academy\u2019s abandoned section. The bunch that are making this as their base\u2026 are quite the organization\u201d (Eva)</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh~, those words hold more strength than mere speculation. You, what are you trying to say?\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201cI mean that there are people inside the Academy cooperating as well. Even if I escape from here, I am just a mere librarian. The situation wouldn\u2019t really change\u201d (Eva)</p><br/><p>Even though your life is most likely in danger, you really say quite the composed things. Well, it is certainly true that there are suspicious people roaming around inside the Rotsgard Academy. Internal cooperation is probably necessary after all. Well, from now on we will be making clear which ones are in that side. I will do that while I get my katana back.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat you say is true. In just a few days later, they may catch you again\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, you were defeated by that person. And it was completely one sided even from my untrained eyes. Not only could you not defeat that person, you couldn\u2019t even escape. Right?\u201d (Eva)</p><br/><p>You poke where it hurts. Certainly. I noticed that I couldn\u2019t escape, so I clenched my teeth and fought, and was defeated. It wasn\u2019t a half-baked strength that would let me say that I could beat that person if I fight next time. Just like when I was defeated by Sis and Boss, I felt despair.</p><br/><p>That brat was a bit older than Boss. Probably the same age as Shiki-san? But having so much power, that person should be famous, and yet, I haven\u2019t heard anything about this.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust like you say, if that thing is there, it is over. But relax. That person is not here. I have also played some cards of my own. My actions stem from a possibility of success\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>I am not someone that just gets defeated and lets it go. If there\u2019s something I can currently do, I will struggle. That\u2019s something the present me has decided. Currently, that bastard is not around this area. To get into action, this situation is convenient.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if I believe in that, it doesn\u2019t mean the danger I carry will change. If you are telling me you will save me from here, I wish you could take the trouble of sweeping out the guys that are making the Academy their nest as well\u201d (Eva)</p><br/><p>She makes quite the unlikable eyes. Eyes as if appraising you. I can\u2019t help but think that this librarian Eva has too many discrepancies. Is this her real self? In that case, to be in a place where so many people gather\u2026 She at least doesn\u2019t give me the impression of a librarian. This woman, is she hiding her position as a noble, or is she a fallen noble? Somewhere around these two options maybe?</p><br/><p>In that case, her name is probably fake as well. Boss really has a troublesome acquaintance. This kind of things are what Tomoe-nesan likes, so taking care of it immediately might be a bad idea. She is also an acquaintance of Boss, so it makes it even more complicated.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake the trouble huh. Well, I do plan on showing them my gratitude. What merits are there to go to such lengths?\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>Even if I have quit being an adventurer, I don\u2019t like doing things for free. Right now I am someone that\u2019s working under a company. If I am going to do work, I should get a reward or in the future it will become troublesome.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 If your background is truly that of a personnel of Kuzunoha Company, I can provide beneficial information for your master. And if you really crush the organization that is extending its hand to the Academy\u2026\u201d (Eva)</p><br/><p>This organization huh. This woman, she definitely knows something about this bunch. Boss would get angry, so I will probably have to ask Shiki-san to peek inside her head a bit in secret. I don\u2019t know her connection, but I can see that she knows enough to fear them.</p><br/><p>This is definitely the bunch Boss asked to investigate. There\u2019s no way a simple librarian would know about such an inhyuman bunch. Eva huh. At this rate, it feels like I will have to investigate in detail her little sister Ruria as well.</p><br/><p>But in this situation, I can\u2019t just carelessly refuse and create enemies that might get me from the back.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Extending its hand to the Academy, and?\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201cI promise you an enormous reward\u201d (Eva)</p><br/><p>How fishy. Seriously. In my times as adventurer, those words are what I doubted the most.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood. Let\u2019s talk about the merits at a later time. I guarantee your safety. I will have you come with me to Boss\u2019s place. But before that, you will probably be seeing displeasing things, so you are obviously prepared right?\u201d (Lime)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem\u201d (Eva)</p><br/><p>Then, let\u2019s finish this in one beat and return to report to Boss. Geez, having that brat seal thought transmission is so inconvenient.</p><br/><p>Okay. I can still use spells, and I also have a weapon. To defeat the bunch that is here, this is good enough.</p><br/><p>Boss told me to put the report as top priority, and depending on what I see from now on, I might not be able to restrain myself. No, saying it clearly, I probably can\u2019t. Thinking that way, it might have been good that I can\u2019t use thought transmission.</p><br/><p>First, the katana. How dare they take away my comrade which I received from Sis. I already have a grasp of the location. This is a weapon that I had them endow with an ability, so I can also accomplish such feat. Weapons with abilities endowed to them are incredibly expensive depending on the quality. Maybe there was some convincing from Sis and Boss with the dwarf bros, but they replicated my request practically exactly. How dare they put their dirty hands on my partner.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why, I wonder what kind of equipment is the one they are creating for Boss, that even those guys are having trouble making.</p><br/><p>A brand new grid metal door that doesn\u2019t match the old atmosphere this place gives, stands in our way. I use the sword in my hand and cut it to pieces. It wasn\u2019t difficult. It is just that the weapon is so good that I can even do things like this.</p><br/><p>With one other person accompanying me, I began the counter-attack.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6</p><br/><p>What\u2026 happened here?</p><br/><p>Shiki and I were perplexed in the place that\u2019s supposed to be the place of the incident.</p><br/><p>Because there was a blatant trace that was not there when we investigated before.</p><br/><p>Also, this feeling, it is the same as what I felt with Tomoe and Lancer.</p><br/><p>\u201cRaidou-sama. This trace continues to where the abandoned section is\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cThis wasn\u2019t here before, right?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Also, this trace, I can feel the presence of a dragon\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>So it really was that. When talking about dragons, Tomoe and Lancer do come to mind.</p><br/><p>It isn\u2019t like Tomoe can\u2019t contact me so, is it Lancer? If it is him, it wouldn\u2019t be strange for Lime to lose.</p><br/><p>A rematch with Sofia? Don\u2019t joke around. I still don\u2019t want to fight her. I don\u2019t want to meet her either. Anyways, those two don\u2019t even listen to words.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s Shiki here so since I already know some of the cards they can play, I think I can provide a decent fight compared to before. But if we are going to fight, I want the prospects to be in our favor. I want to avoid fights that I don\u2019t know the result of.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis looks like it has been concealed at least, but it\u2019s like that person didn\u2019t even try that hard\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s most likely a trap. It\u2019s just that if it\u2019s a dragon, the connection with the demons might have thinned a bit. There\u2019s should be no dragon close to Rona\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s the chance it is Lancer. They seem to be in the demons side\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat Lancer who was accompanying the Dragon Killer huh. Fumu. Then there\u2019s no need to hesitate. Raidou-sama, let\u2019s go\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cHah?!\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>No no, hesitate! If even Shiki becomes a battle junky, my stomach won\u2019t hold out from the stress you know?!</p><br/><p>\u201cIf this path leads to Lancer and the Dragon Killer, isn\u2019t that a nice chance? I will have them repent while dying, for spilling my master\u2019s blood\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cS-Shiki\u2026\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cFukukuku that Lime. He really does do a good job. Normally, it is custom to call Tomoe-dono and Mio-dono, but in this emergency situation, we can make the excuse that we had no choice. I don\u2019t care about Dragon Killer or Sword Saint, whatever. To think that the chance would come for me\u2026 Nice, how nice. Excellent\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>I thought that Shiki was the most composed one when listening to that story, but it seems that he was just silently holding it in. S-Scary.</p><br/><p>His eyes were like those he had when I first met him. In those red eyes I felt more madness than before. That he is laughing weakly makes the image even more intense.</p><br/><p>\u201cOi, those guys are really strong. Are you listening Shiki?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Of course. That means I can make them suffer as much as I want right? Don\u2019t worry, I don\u2019t intend to hold back, not even one bit. If by any chance I am not enough, at that time it is fine to just call those two. I will show them that despair isn\u2019t such a shallow thing, those fools\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>He is totally gone. In the rematch with Sofia, I might not have a chance to participate. It is sad to leave it with my defeat, but Shiki is like this. My will to hold down my followers is already gone. No, honestly speaking, seeing them being angry because of me, I just don\u2019t feel like holding them back.</p><br/><p>Shiki is this motivated. I will also be going, so unless something big happens, we can deal with it. I have enough confidence to say that it won\u2019t go the same as last time.</p><br/><p>A trap huh.</p><br/><p>Interesting. Since becoming my follower, I haven\u2019t seen Shiki\u2019s 100%. When training with me, it is mostly counter-spell training after all. After doing a pact with me and learned several things, I haven\u2019t actually seen him fight. In the Forest Onis\u2019 training, Shiki doesn\u2019t participate either.</p><br/><p>No. If we are purely talking about fighting against an enemy, it is not only Shiki, I haven\u2019t seen any of my followers fighting seriously.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know what is waiting for us, but Shiki and I head to the abandoned area.</p><br/><p>Shiki was already wrapped with a fiendish aura while he mumbles. He is already in a state that\u2019s impossible to talk to.</p><br/><p>(Boss, I am sorry for messing up. This is Lime. I am together with the Academy\u2019s librarian Eva-san too. Right now I am in the abandoned section and have confirmed the existence of the facility. While putting Eva-san\u2019s safety as top priority, I have finished stopping the facility\u2019s functionality and wiped out the enemies) (Lime)</p><br/><p>Eh?</p><br/><p>L-Lime?!</p><br/><p>Seriously. I received a contact from Lime who I thought was cut off. Good thing I left the communication open from our side. That\u2019s good but\u2026</p><br/><p>(Lime, are you okay?! Also, you are with Eva-san too?! Etto, eh, there was no dragon there?) (Makoto)</p><br/><p>(Dragon? No, there was no dragon. I just had a talk with the facility\u2026 The two of us are completely fine. I will give the detailed report at a later time. Just that, it seems like Eva-san wants to talk with Boss about something. We will now be heading to where you are. You are around the place where I was attacked right?) (Lime)</p><br/><p>(Y-Yeah\u2026) (Makoto)</p><br/><p>He has impressive location grasping. He is already like a professional scout.</p><br/><p>(Well then) (Lime)</p><br/><p>Well then?!</p><br/><p>Meaning he is heading directly here?!</p><br/><p>This is bad Shiki! We have to turn Shiki back! It would be bad if Eva-san sees him right now! Tte, my mind is a complete mess?!</p><br/><p>\u201cShiki, Lime is coming back! It seems like he has already finished dealing with things! Oi, return Shiki! Switch off! Stoooppu! Put away that fiendish magic power already! Smile! Smile!\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Lime. That guy, that guuuy!\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you listening?! Switch!!\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cHaving me psyched up so much and suddenly saying \u201cI am back\u201d! Just who does he think he is! Why can\u2019t he just wait obediently, that guy?!\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo no no no! There was no dragon! A mistake! It was a mistake!\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Before Lime returns, I try to soothe Shiki into returning to his Academy mode. It\u2019s been a while since I have had such a high difficulty mission.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6</p><br/><p>(Raidou huh. I won\u2019t take his words about being a merchant to heart. But it is certainly true that I didn\u2019t feel a single bit of hate towards demons. I didn\u2019t even feel like he had an objective like the Dragon Killer who joined hands with us. Normal, it was truly normal. Are you telling me that boy interacts with demons as if he were talking to a foreign hyuman?)</p><br/><p>Rona was lying silently on the bed at the room addressed for Karen Frost. Her eyes were also closed. But inside her head, she was trying to put in order the vast amount of unexpected information.</p><br/><p>Her main job as a demon general is to gather information and bring it to practical use. At times she also proposes plans and tactics. In terms of battle power, between the 4 demon generals, she is third place. But she doesn\u2019t really mind it that much. Because she considers that as long as she can be of use to her master in her specialty, then that\u2019s good. That\u2019s why, even if she ends up being hated or despised because of how she uses her specialty, Rona will not falter. For her that\u2019s actually a representation of her loyalty to her mission, so she is proud of it.</p><br/><p>(His ability as a teacher in a hyuman academy is too deviated. Even in the academies that have several high leveled teachers, his quality is a bit different. And also, if the hyumans that he is guiding will be appearing from now on, that would be a bit inconvenient. That kind of thinking is something that\u2019s similar to ours. Against an opponent that has more numbers, there\u2019s the need of a drawback. Meaning that he is a target that one should take care stealthily. The problem is that amount of information and that person\u2019s thinking in itself. He knows my name that only a set number of people know. That kind of information gathering ability, I have to crush it somehow. I am surprised by the way of thinking of Raidou, but in reality it is a really beneficial one. I felt like he was pretty easy to handle and I think that he can become a useful pawn. A person that knows my name and can\u2019t lower my guard from. The best method would be to eliminate Shiki and entice Raidou. It should become a big benefit to us demons)</p><br/><p>Right now, Rona has ordered the people that have stealthily infiltrated to investigate about the Kuzunoha Company and Raidou. As it wasn\u2019t a place with much danger level, the people that Rona brought weren\u2019t that excelling in ability. Even though they are currently short of capable people, she will regret this decision.</p><br/><p>Because it would not only be pointless if they are sniffed out, but will actually backfire as well, Rona ordered them to make sure not to be detected. It would affect the speed of information gathering as well as the efficiency, but right now there\u2019s a need to know the other party if even a bit. For that sake, she judged that it would be okay to force themselves.</p><br/><p>(In the Academy there\u2019s no visible movements from Kuzunoha Company. I will confirm their merchandise at a later time but\u2026 since it is a miscellaneous store, I don\u2019t know if there will be anything that will stand out. In the guild\u2019s information, the company\u2019s entry was filled as an \u201call do\u201d store. Taking into account the time when he registered in the guild and his decision of the type of industry, it looks like his business ability isn\u2019t that good. The person itself doesn\u2019t have excelling ability, and yet, in his surroundings there\u2019s only capably people. How strange. He probably has some sort of talent. Let\u2019s see, his fighting ability was quite high. To the point that I almost thought of fighting him seriously. But his assistant Shiki seems to be pretty strong as well though\u2026 Is it sufficient to just call it an ability to gather capable people?)</p><br/><p>Staying in a vague area without being able to reach a conclusion, Rona gets irritated by her thoughts that don\u2019t show any signs of organizing. At least, as long as they don\u2019t do anything, she won\u2019t be able to put anything together. In that case, she must put up a plan, but in this state where she can\u2019t clearly see the other party and doesn\u2019t know how much information they possess, just how far would she be able to step into? She can\u2019t bring herself to decide.</p><br/><p>(For now, let\u2019s have them show me their mobilization ability and fighting power in \u201cthat matter\u201d. I have already finished the original objective I came here for, so there\u2019s no need for me to cross a dangerous bridge. As long as there aren\u2019t any people related to the temple, there\u2019s no way he would have a good impression of hyumans in \u201cthat matter\u201d. Injustice to the demi-humans can be shifted into blame for the hyumans. If we take into account that I am here, it might even connect into a better impression of the demons. No matter where it rolls, it won\u2019t be bad for me. If he asks for my cooperation, even if I decide to help myself, it won\u2019t be an impediment. It can even turn into a foundation for future plans. That situation, you might say, it is a good chance)</p><br/><p>Rona opens her eyes. In the current state, she can cope with accidents and she has already thought about the prospects. Her thought arranging must have finished.</p><br/><p>And she notices that the curtains of night were beginning to fall. Noticing that she used quite the amount of time, she makes a wry smile.</p><br/><p>The chances a war between hyumans and demons beginning in the near future are high. She has already anticipated that she will be participating in that war herself and she still has a lot of work left to do. It\u2019s just that, the existence of Raidou has scrambled her schedule a bit.</p><br/><p>(Anyways, as long as Io is in Stella, most unexpected scenarios can be handled. In terms of commanding in the battlefield and battle power, it is hard to find people I can believe to this extent. Even when I think about the current scale of the battle, we have the hyuman Sofia who is the number one in the list of strongest, so as long as we have her in our hands, the attacks from that side will be less without doubt. Also, it would be perfect if we could just learn the identity and gauge the power of the Devil. The stage is moving exactly as our lord has written. If the Devil is Raidou then things would turn easier, but as expected, there\u2019s no way it would go so smoothly. The battle ability and magic scale; the information is not that reliable but we also gathered information about its appearance. If we put aside the gender of Raidou, it would be that coat only. A red and blue vestment. If we take into account the parts that look the same, that\u2019s the only part that matches. Hah~. If I just suspect of him because of that blue coat, my intuition is growing dull. Even though I intended to not be infected by that stupidly peaceful atmosphere at the Academy\u2026 Geez, let\u2019s just rest for today)</p><br/><p>The time she learns that Raidou and the Devil are the same person, seems to be in a later future.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

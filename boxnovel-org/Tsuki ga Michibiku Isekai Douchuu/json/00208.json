But since it is a water dragon, this might be more fitting actually. It is incredibly interesting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Makoto and Hibiki were at the island that is floating at the center of Meiris Lake, in that place, there\u2019s a giant temple.</p><br/><p>It looked like an ancient greece temple, with stone tiles and stairs, and the material quality of every article that made this place was high.</p><br/><p>It made the two feel that this is not a place where people live.</p><br/><p>(\u2026The damage is terrible. It would be another case if it were ruins, but this is a dwelling. There\u2019s a lot of recent damage made by magic and swords. It seems like the \u2018a lot of things happening\u2019, are pretty violent stuff.) (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>The outward appearance and its interior was terribly damage to be called a dwelling.</p><br/><p>Just as Hibiki noticed, there was quite a lot of recent damage.</p><br/><p>She was certain that there had been a large scale battle in this place.</p><br/><p>\u201cWater has been used as a mirror since time immemorial. The special traits of water are a lot more varied than hyumans can think of.\u201d (Waterfall)</p><br/><p>Waterfall stepped forward first.</p><br/><p>She was sitting on top of the Gel type mamono, and turned her head to answer the guests that she had invited.</p><br/><p>The Superior Dragon Waterfall\u2019s dwelling is at an island at the center of Meiris Lake.</p><br/><p>But in the Meiris Lake that Makoto and Hibiki were just a few moments ago didn\u2019t have an island at its center.</p><br/><p>Right now, they are at a space of Meiris Lake that Waterfall had created.</p><br/><p>Its utilization is quite different from Tomoe\u2019s, but Waterfall was a dragon that possessed a space as well.</p><br/><p>(Mirror huh. Is it like the world at the other side of the mirror? The scene at the water\u2019s surface can be broken by the waves and gives an unstable image, but even though this is small for a space, it feels like it is stable. It resembles Tomoe\u2019s Asora, but\u2026could it be that water is the closest to the element of space creation?) (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Makoto was comparing the inherent ability of Tomoe \u2013Asora\u2013 with the current space that was probably created by Waterfall.</p><br/><p>\u201cWaterfall, let me go right to the point. If I were to put it the water element to practical use, can I compose a separate space even if temporary, and retain it?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Hibiki was thinking if she could put the water element into practical use to create a separate space she can use as a storage.</p><br/><p>If they can make use of it, it would be extremely useful in armies.</p><br/><p>They have to rival the demon race in techniques and strategy as much as possible, or the hyumans will continue suffering hard fights.</p><br/><p>It is because she understands this that she made this question.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s no chance, but this temple holds the special characteristic of my water, and it was combined with the power of the Meiris Lake; a result born by chance. It is also the one of the reasons why I live here. In magic, water is indeed one of the elements closest to creating a space, but in terms of the utilization you are thinking of, the one with the highest chance of knowing would be a certain someone that specializes in illusions.\u201d (Waterfall)</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone that specializes in illusions\u2026 It is true that something of this level can\u2019t be done easily.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>(I feel like she is talking directly about Tomoe. Just how do the memories of Superior Dragons work? She is talking of Tomoe as if she knew of her. Anyways, this place is really different to Asora. Her space is only as big as a lake after all. Also, there\u2019s a problem in it.) (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Makoto didn\u2019t react to the words of Waterfall and was thinking.</p><br/><p>He was using Sakai and trying to understand this space.</p><br/><p>From the information that was gathered, he learned that this place is simply connected to the real Meiris Lake, and it was different from Asora which can be used for complete isolation if they wanted to.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow then, please come in. Fortunately, I am currently in this size. We will be able to talk comfortably here.\u201d (Waterfall)</p><br/><p>Following the invitation of Waterfall, the place that we arrived at was a courtyard.</p><br/><p>A soft bright light was shining, and there\u2019s a lake at one\u2019s field of vision.</p><br/><p>A table and sits were prepared, and there were even cups and a pot.</p><br/><p>Makoto and Hibiki took their seats, and Waterfall takes a seat that was raised for herself.</p><br/><p>The Gel skillfully grabs the pot and serves what seems to be tea to Makoto and Hibiki. It turns to Waterfall and trembles once before trailing its way out of the courtyard.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat guy is quite handy.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is the one that takes care of my everyday necessities. Because of that incident, they have decreased a lot in numbers though.\u201d (Waterfall)</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it your familiar? Or maybe a devotee?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is the same relationship as that of \u2018her\u2019 and the Mist Lizards, Raidou.\u201d (Waterfall)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I see.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Makoto was impressed by the dedication of the Gel.</p><br/><p>With an answer that only Makoto would understand, she expressed the relationship between both.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Waterfall, is it really okay for me to be here as well?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Making a conversation that she didn\u2019t understand as soon as it begins, Hibiki asked in consideration.</p><br/><p>She was already given the permission to be there, but it was to confirm just in case.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. I hold a personal interest in you. Please accompany us here. My conversation with Raidou won\u2019t be long, and after, there\u2019s also something I want to talk with you about.\u201d (Waterfall)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Understood.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cNow then, Raidou. It seems \u2018that person\u2019 has caused you a lot of trouble huh. Even though the problem has been resolved, it is easy to imagine that the situation would have gotten even worse without your help. With that in consideration as well, I give you my gratitude.\u201d (Waterfall)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is not something you have to turn so courteous when saying. Also, the one that was troubled the most was probably Grount-san. I think that it would be better to thank that person instead of me.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cGrount huh. You went through the White Desert by feet, right? It is certainly true that since I am in this kind of state, I most likely caused a lot of burden to her.\u201d (Waterfall)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways, I think that, as a Superior Dragon, I have to reward you. You probably won\u2019t be happy about money and goods, so I have prepared a magic book for you.\u201d (Waterfall)</p><br/><p>(A magic book. At times, I feel strong magic power from Makoto-kun, and at times I don\u2019t feel anything at all, which I don\u2019t understand well. With that attack that dispersed the purple cloud, I should think that he possesses a giant amount of magic power. In that case, a magic book from a dragon could increase his power even more. But I currently have no way of stopping it. How vexing.) (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Hearing the word magic book, Hibiki instantly strengthens her caution.</p><br/><p>A strong magician will be obtaining strong spells.</p><br/><p>Hibiki understands just how much of a danger that is.</p><br/><p>\u201cA magic book. Thank you very much.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cI think you will be needing it. Please use it for the sake of leading the world to a good path. Of course, I don\u2019t mind if you take a number of them. I will guide you there, so how about checking them out?\u201d (Waterfall)</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that okay?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Makoto made a honest reaction to the words \u2018he is going to need it\u2019.</p><br/><p>Waterfall who seemed to understand the situation, told Makoto that she had prepared magic books that he would need.</p><br/><p>Obviously he would have an interest.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. You have accepted my gratitude, and if you will be taking the recompense for it as well, it would only make me happy. At the other side of the courtyard, I have a guide waiting at the pathway along the lake. With this, let\u2019s put a finish to the stiff talk, and I will be speaking with Hibiki for a while.\u201d (Waterfall)</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry for the trouble, and thanks.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>(She feels the most sober out of all the Superior Dragons I have met. Honestly, it derails my pace.) (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Makoto stands up from his seat, and advances through the corridor that Waterfall had pointed, and disappeared from the field of vision of Waterfall and Hibiki who were left.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the back of Makoto going away, a silent time between Waterfall and Hibiki began.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I understand that you had Makoto-kun leave and wanted to speak with me about something. Just that, I think that your position is higher than mine and Makoto-kun. Can I ask your reason for this?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Hibiki who has been silent until now, looks straight at Waterfall and speaks.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are sharp. I am relieved that you are just as I expected you to be, Hibiki. The reason why I wanted to be alone with you, is because I have something to request of you.\u201d (Waterfall)</p><br/><p>\u201cA request? A Superior Dragon like you\u2026to me?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t something strange. Even a Goddess is requesting of a hero after all.\u201d (Waterfall)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust as you can see, I am currently not in a body that can exert much power. In truth, I would have prefered to make contact with you before I turned this way, but an unexpected situation occurred and it couldn\u2019t be fulfilled.\u201d (Waterfall)</p><br/><p>\u201cA lot happened?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, I will be requesting of you, so I will be telling you later. Hibiki.\u201d (Waterfall)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease seal Raidou.\u201d (Waterfall)</p><br/><p>\u201c!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing the unexpected words of Waterfall, Hibiki\u2019s breath stancades.</p><br/><p>Leaving her surprised eyes, she simply waited for the words of Waterfall that should have a continuation.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if I am saying seal, I am not telling you to do anything dangerous. Accurately speaking, I want you to prevent him from growing more than he is now. I want you to be the overseer of this.\u201d (Waterfall)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cI think you have already noticed, but that person is incredibly dangerous. It could be said that he is already a danger to all the existences that live in this world.\u201d (Waterfall)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026That much?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cWe \u2013Superior Dragons\u2013 normally don\u2019t intervene in the dispute between hyumans and demi-humans, and we don\u2019t have an interest in it either. Frankly speaking, we don\u2019t care who they glorify in this world. That\u2019s why, leaving aside the Spirits, the Superior Dragons don\u2019t actively take part in the war between hyumans and demons.\u201d (Waterfall)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>While being well-known as an existence of high power, the Superior Dragons practically didn\u2019t intervene in the war that\u2019s currently happening.</p><br/><p>Grount who is giving divine protection to one of the knights of the Empire, is a dragon that provides power to the people no matter if there\u2019s a war or not.</p><br/><p>The exception was Lancer, but it is not like he was cooperating with the hyumans or cooperating with the demons.</p><br/><p>Because of the contract with Sofia, both were merely moving for their own objectives.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut thinking about the hyumans, demi-humans, and the many races out there in this world, there\u2019s one hyuman that becomes an unprecedented threat to them. That\u2019s Raidou. Misumi Makoto. Depending on his actions, I might have to move myself.\u201d (Waterfall)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026An unprecedented threat.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Waterfall had a thinking that was incredibly close to what Hibiki thought.</p><br/><p>That this dragon is perceiving Makoto with the same level of threat she does.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeople change as easy as water, they possess a flexible vessel, and are living beings that can show change in trickery. Normally, I would oversee all this, and even if there were a revolutionist appearing, it would only be considered as the natural flow. But Raidou is not even that. He will simply destroy. Nothing will be born from him. In the past, present, and future, he will simply destroy. He is the kind of existence that has a strong possibility to do this.\u201d (Waterfall)</p><br/><p>(It is practically the same thinking. Makoto-kun won\u2019t hesitate in fighting against existences that he has deemed as enemies. And he thinks of life \u2013and most likely his own as well\u2013 in an incredibly dry manner. For the sake of resolving the problem, he wouldn\u2019t care about eliminating the obstacle. He is a boy that would naturally accept this flow of events. And without thinking back on it, he steps forward.) (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Waterfall had been defeated by Sofia, and was absorbed temporarily into herself.</p><br/><p>For Waterfall who has been thinking about making contact with Hibiki, this was a big blunder.</p><br/><p>But thanks to that, Waterfall was able to witness the two battles of Raidou against Sofia, and within the egg, she was able to learn a lot through Root\u2019s analysis.</p><br/><p>On top of that, what Waterfall thought first was to jeer at certain existences that were right beside that person.</p><br/><p>\u2018Just how far are you going to go in order to fulfill your own enjoyment?! Just what do you think of the world, you idiotic bunch?!\u2019</p><br/><p>80% was directed at Root, and 20% was directed at Tomoe.</p><br/><p>Afterwards, she let out her anger that couldn\u2019t turn into words, and was throwing jeers that she had no choice but to not say.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s been a long time since Waterfall had fallen into a complete state of rage.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why Waterfall was grateful for the unexpected chance that Hibiki came to Meiris Lake as well.</p><br/><p>And so, she decided to throw away her restrains.</p><br/><p>\u201cHis past self wasn\u2019t like that, he was a normal young man. He probably didn\u2019t have that abnormal nature there\u2019s no way of hiding.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe possible reason is this world. Being separated from his family and the world that was filled with peaceful common sense, he has slowly shedded off the way of thinking of \u2018that other world\u2019. Even so, right now it is only on the level of shedding off the thin skin of the egg. His morals and ethics are still alive, so that\u2019s probably the remains of the Raidou that Hibiki previously knew of.\u201d (Waterfall)</p><br/><p>\u201cAn abnormal nature that would have been buried if he hadn\u2019t come to this world\u2026 In other words, he is a person that would have been better if he hadn\u2019t come?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly. Thinking about the fact that he should have originally been summoned alone into this world, it could be considered that this situation is a miracle in itself.\u201d (Waterfall)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What do you mean by that?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe head of the Superior Dragons has a connection with the Goddess. Since it is the information of that person, it should be credible, but originally, the only one that had a connection to this world, was Raidou.\u201d (Waterfall)</p><br/><p>\u201cIn other words, the irregulars are not Makoto-kun, but us who were called here as heroes?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, and from what I guess, that\u2019s has probably become some sort of debt inside of Raidou.\u201d (Waterfall)</p><br/><p>\u201cDebt? Why?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Hibiki asks for the basis of that guess.</p><br/><p>Hibiki and Tomoki had consented to coming to this world after hearing the situation from the Goddess.</p><br/><p>It is certainly true that if given more time, the answer might have changed, but it was a decision they made themselves.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why, even if they are irregulars, the fact that they have become heroes isn\u2019t something that Makoto should feel indebted for.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is only a guess. Finding a suitable time, please confirm it with your own ears. And if it\u2019s actually true\u2026\u201d (Waterfall)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026You are telling to keep silent about my feelings that: \u2019I don\u2019t think anything about it, and that\u2019s just misplaced debt\u2019?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026It is great that you are quick on the uptake.\u201d (Waterfall)</p><br/><p>If the person feels debt by himself, it shouldn\u2019t be corrected and utilized instead.</p><br/><p>In that sense, the two of them were in sync.</p><br/><p>\u201cHonestly, Makoto-kun\u2019s threat level is something that I felt as well. Today it turned into certainty though. I don\u2019t know if I will be able to answer your expectations, but I do think that I must associate with him in a prudent manner.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine. Don\u2019t let him get used to the battlefield, and make him be as far as possible from the war. If the person himself is satisfied with being a merchant, please help him do it. In present, that\u2019s the best direction.\u201d (Waterfall)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have a plan that can solve the root problem?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cI have one, but leaving aside him, the people around him most likely won\u2019t consent to it. If possible, that would be the best solution, and it is also what he has gone to check at this moment.\u201d (Waterfall)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026And that is?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is simple. The technique for a recalling ritual. For me, that would be the best solution, but\u2026thinking about the current situation, it would be impossible to realize.\u201d (Waterfall)</p><br/><p>\u201c*Summon? No, a recall?!* In other words, a method to return to Japan!! In that case!!\u201d (Hibiki) </p><br/><p>Hearing the solution of Waterfall, Hibiki\u2019s eyes glittered in an instant.</p><br/><p>Certainly, if it\u2019s that method, Raidou who is not that attached to this world, would not only give his consent, but that way, it will also work as the perfect isolation.</p><br/><p>She thought that it was the best method where no one would be unhappy.</p><br/><p>But at the same time, it bothered her that Waterfall said it was impossible in a regrettable manner.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026To accomplish the ritual there\u2019s the need for around a thousand lives, and on top of that, it can only recall. Moreover, it is not a forced one, but a ritual where the person has to consent to in order to actually work.\u201d (Waterfall)</p><br/><p>\u201cA thousand\u2026\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Hibiki thought that it was a small amount of sacrifices compared to the danger he might cause in the future.</p><br/><p>\u201cRaidou has a special companion relationship between many, and the people that have a strong connection with him in this world are not few. It is not a realistic solution.\u201d (Waterfall)</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you referring to Tomoe-san and Mio-san?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Yeah. It is troublesome. About Mio, your companion Chiya probably knows of it already. When you return, you can hear it from her. What I can say for sure is that, whether it is Tomoe or Mio, it will be impossible to obtain consent for the recall. Because even if the residents of this world consent to the recalling ritual, they won\u2019t be able to go to the same world as Raidou.\u201d (Waterfall)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHibiki, listen well. Change him not with battle, but with a different method, and find some way to seal him within peace. Raidou\u2019s vessel for power itself is completely different from you and the Empire\u2019s hero. It can take form suddenly, and trying to oppose it would be a foolish. No matter how big of a vessel hyumans possess, they won\u2019t be able to take in the whole sea. It goes beyond comparison.\u201d (Waterfall)</p><br/><p>\u201cVessel of power\u2026\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if we were to put all the power in this world into one, I don\u2019t think we would be able to realize a battle.\u201d (Waterfall)</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, don\u2019t tell me that even the Goddess\u2026\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026If it turns into a situation where the Goddess herself comes down to this world and fights\u2026\u201d (Waterfall)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis world will most likely be destroyed by its root.\u201d (Waterfall)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cI am sure of this.\u201d (Waterfall)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Waterfall is saying this.</p><br/><p>That Makoto already has the power to outdo the Goddess.</p><br/><p>As expected, Hibiki was unable to easily accept this level of opinion.</p><br/><p>She decided to just listen to it as one opinion Waterfall has of Raidou.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have learned of both sides of the Goddess\u2019 world, and even with that, you were still able to think about changing it from the inside. That approach of yours struck my heart. Because of my powerless body, I am unable to provide you divine protection or form a pact with you, but I \u2013the Superior Dragon Waterfall\u2013 promise to cooperate with hero Hibiki. I will leave this world in Hibiki\u2019s hands.\u201d (Waterfall)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I said it before but, why did Waterfall end up in that body?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I still haven\u2019t explained it, right. Actually, I was killed by the Dragon Slayer Sofia not that long ago.\u201d (Waterfall)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Eh?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd then, aside from me, there was also Crimson Red and Darkness Clad. Sofia who had killed us and obtained our power, was half killed by Raidou who didn\u2019t suffer a single injury.\u201d (Waterfall)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Eh?!\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd then, Sofia was finished by our Head. Being released, we were looked after by the Superior Dragon\u2019s Head, and Raidou is currently delivering them to the several locations.\u201d (Waterfall)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe has connections with the demon race as well, so I think Hibiki will definitely have it hard. If you were a man, your hair would definitely fall mercilessly. But I believe that if it\u2019s you, you will be able to gather all the circumstances, and lead it to the best result.\u201d (Waterfall)</p><br/><p>\u201cWa, wait!!\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Being told truths she didn\u2019t know of one after the other, Hibiki had turned into a reaction doll.</p><br/><p>With its round eyes, Waterfall was looking straight at Hibiki with a pressure that didn\u2019t suit her small body as she cornered her more and more.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuh~, after saying it out, I now feel a bit lighter. It\u2019s like something has come off from my shoulder.\u201d (Waterfall)</p><br/><p>\u201cD-Don\u2019t just put it down!! What was that about the demon race?! No matter what I do, we would end up confronting anyways then!!\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Please do your best, Hibiki.\u201d (Waterfall)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are supposed to be cooperating with me, right? Didn\u2019t you say that just now? Isn\u2019t all of this something that shouldn\u2019t be said now, but at a more earlier stage?!!\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry. I was dead all this time, and today I was recently born. Even if I could observe, I wasn\u2019t in a state where I could tell you.\u201d (Waterfall)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with that\u2026? What\u2019s that about being dead, seriously\u2026\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Hibiki who had stood up from her seat, once again took her seat as if the strength in her legs had given out.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven so, Hibiki, you won\u2019t break. Your nature is that of a challenger. And you are a genius. Wring out the power of the people to protect this world and the Goddess as well.\u201d (Waterfall)</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder why\u2026I feel incredibly tired.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen you return, listen to what the priestess has to say. And then, if possible, try having a bout with Raidou. By doing that, you will definitely understand; what I saw and feared.\u201d (Waterfall)</p><br/><p>Hibiki didn\u2019t answer Waterfall\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>She had her head hung down and her eyes closed. Maybe she was trying to understand this situation, or it might be that she is simply exhausted.</p><br/><p>She continued staying silent.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026For now, I will try with the talk about the recall and the convincing. And after that, I will try having a bout. If I have no choice but to do it, I understand I will have to carry this burden as I move forward.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>(To think that I would have to do something like this when we are still in war\u2026 I feel like I am doing war with both the Kuzunoha Company and the demon race at the same time.) (Hibiki) </p><br/><p>\u201cI am counting on you. Ah, try to act as you always do with Raidou.\u201d (Waterfall)</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause I was the one you told the situation to, you believe that I am able to do it, right? I have somewhat understood your personality.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cHow reliable.\u201d (Waterfall)</p><br/><p>Hibiki stands up and heads towards the library that Makoto went to.</p><br/><p>Waterfall got on Hibiki\u2019s shoulder and showed her will to accompany her.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, Hibiki. If it\u2019s for a short time, I can make myself bigger, so at the time of your return, I will be taking you outside. It will also provide a plus to your name.\u201d (Waterfall)</p><br/><p>\u201cSince the circumstances are like this, I will accept anything that can serve as a plus.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Thinking about the meaning of returning by riding a dragon, Hibiki accepts the proposal immediately.</p><br/><p>Hearing a vast amount of information, she felt that she wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep for several days, and a small sigh leaked out.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6</p><br/><p>Riding a giant dragon, Hibiki and Makoto return to the capital.</p><br/><p>The big frame of Waterfall that came flying in the sunset sky had surprised the people of the capital, but after learning that Hibiki was riding at its back, they were welcomed with big ovations.</p><br/><p>(Eh? There\u2019s a lot of rubble outside. The help of Rotsgard shouldn\u2019t have come yet, so\u2026 Was Mio the one who did it?) (Makoto)</p><br/><p>After finishing the delivery of the egg as per usual, Makoto obtained several useful magic books from Waterfall and was in a good mood.</p><br/><p>Teleporting from world to world.</p><br/><p>Learning of the existence of magic books that have magic formations that could be used for this purpose, Makoto was dazed.</p><br/><p>By the time Hibiki and Waterfall had finished their talk and had come to look for him, Makoto was seriously reading through the magic books.</p><br/><p>Coming down from Waterfall who had landed close to the outer walls, she said her thanks to Makoto and Hibiki, and just like that, they parted ways and returned to the castle.</p><br/><p>It was close to dinner.</p><br/><p>Makoto did a meeting with Mio and Lime; Hibiki did an emergency meeting with the Limia king, prince Joshua, and the close aides of the king.</p><br/><p>Within the tense atmosphere, Hibiki explains about Waterfall.</p><br/><p>Of course, the talk of Waterfall wasn\u2019t something that could be readily said, and was unable to explain the dangerous sensation she felt at that moment.</p><br/><p>Moreover, Joshua spoke about the assistance in the reconstruction from the Kuzunoha Company, and that made her sigh several times.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Makoto praised Mio for helping out in the reconstruction, and thanked Lime.</p><br/><p>He spoke about how he already finished delivering the egg and showed Mio the magic books that Waterfall had given him.</p><br/><p>In contrast to Limia\u2019s side, this side\u2019s conversation advanced in a cheerful manner.</p><br/><p>And then\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMio-san is the black spider, Onee-chan.\u201d (Chiya)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Please give me a break\u2026\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is the truth. Also, that person Raidou, uhm, he is in control of that black spider, or keeping her.\u201d (Chiya)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Hah\u2026\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cOnee-chan.\u201d (Chiya)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it, Chiya-chan?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Hibiki went to see Chiya who had woken up.</p><br/><p>At today\u2019s dinner, it will be Kuzunoha Company, the royal family, and the hero party, who will be participating.</p><br/><p>Since they didn\u2019t know if Chiya would be able to attend it, it was also a visit to see if she had the will to do it.</p><br/><p>She apologized first for having her use the Mind\u2019s Eye, but Chiya got angry saying that it wasn\u2019t necessary to apologize.</p><br/><p>Hibiki didn\u2019t want to forcefully ask her about the image she got, but the priestess herself opened the conversation, and Hibiki felt a profound gratitude towards that action, but the contents of it made her face stiffen.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat Raidou person is definitely a no. Fighting him or even getting along with him is a no. I don\u2019t think he as good of a person as he makes it out to be. If possible, don\u2019t get involved with the Kuzunoha Company either.\u201d (Chiya)</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did that person look to you, Chiya-chan?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026It was a smooth white hyuman shaped image, but inside of him, there was an incredibly disagreeing \u2018something\u2019.\u201d (Chiya)</p><br/><p>\u201cI have heard about hyuman shaped ones a number of times already, but having something is new.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe white part was slightly cracked. From there, I could see it slightly.\u201d (Chiya)</p><br/><p>\u201cCracked\u2026 In other words, the white hyuman shape is the figure he thinks he is\u2026and that has begun to fall apart? But white. Until now, there hasn\u2019t been an image with that color, right?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, but it was a pure white.\u201d (Chiya)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhichever it is, I have understood plenty enough that it is a dangerous image. And that we shouldn\u2019t settle an interpretation of it too soon as well. Thanks, Chiya-chan. You don\u2019t have to look at them with your Mind\u2019s Eye anymore.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Yeah. But if needed, I will do it again, okay?\u201d (Chiya)</p><br/><p>\u201cEven so, Mio is the black spider huh. I did think it was strange that there were no reports of it appearing again after we only encountered it once but\u2026to think that she was an employee in a company, there\u2019s a limit to unexpected. In other words, the opponent that played around with us until the verge of death and left on a whim, saved us in our training and gave us equipment huh. What are we doing, seriously.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>The self-depreciating mutters of Hibiki at the end had leaked.</p><br/><p>Her words had an unusual bitterness in it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe person called Raidou is probably stronger than her. And Mio-san didn\u2019t seem to dislike being controlled. Also\u2026\u201d (Chiya)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, continue.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat person\u2019s image\u2026had three chains of control. In other words, he has two other people that are similar to Mio-san.\u201d (Chiya)</p><br/><p>\u201cTwo huh. Okay. I have a slight idea of who.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. As expected of Onee-chan.\u201d (Chiya)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Hey, Chiya-chan. Today\u2019s dinner will be with the people of Kuzunoha Company. Will you be able to come? If it is too hard for you, you can eat in your room, you know?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cI will go. I have done something rude to them after all. I have to apologize.\u201d (Chiya)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t scared?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cSouring their mood and having them cause trouble to Limia Kingdom and Lorel Union is something I want even less, so I\u2019m fine.\u201d (Chiya)</p><br/><p>The priestess that had an expression that didn\u2019t suit her age, said this firmly.</p><br/><p>For a second, Hibiki was in mute amazement, but she soon showed a smile that came from deep inside and nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso\u2026after finishing the meal, as a sideshow, I was thinking about\u2026fighting him onc\u2013\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t!!\u201d (Chiya)</p><br/><p>She cut off Hibiki\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026It is only a bout, you know? We won\u2019t be fighting to death. This is just my guess but, if he is like that, it is safe. Also, even if it turns dangerous\u2026he is someone that we have to probe no matter what. It is also because someone asked me to, but I think it is necessary too.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat person is far more dangerous than Tomoki-san, you know? This is only a possibility, but maybe even more than the Demon Lord.\u201d (Chiya)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I know. I also share the same opinion, Chiya-chan. I think there\u2019s other methods we can use, but to tell you the truth, I wanted to test a bit.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat person? No, Onee-chan herself?\u201d (Chiya)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. \u2018I won\u2019t move on self-interest anymore\u2019, that\u2019s what I thought of doing, but I still can\u2019t do it. Throwing my all, I want to learn more about him, about myself.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Then I will also watch. When you get hurt, I will heal you immediately.\u201d (Chiya)</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease. I am sorry for being an useless hero.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cFor me, Hibiki Onee-chan is the best hero-sama, so you are not useless!\u201d (Chiya)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I see.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you would be accepting this kind of request. Thank you, Raidou-dono.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mind it. It is something that I have been thinking of as well. To be able to have a bout with hero-sama, it is something I can boast about.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Two hours after finishing dinner without any incidents.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe less spectators the better, but making it less than this was impossible.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Makoto and Hibiki were about to confront at the place where the knights train, located at the back of the castle. </p><br/><p>Just like Hibiki said, there\u2019s few spectators since it is a faraway place.</p><br/><p>The hero party, Limia King, prince Joshua, and a number of nobles.</p><br/><p>And then, the Kuzunoha Company\u2019s Mio and Lime.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>(After I finish what I want to try, I can just go ahead and lose after all.) (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will both go seriously and with our all, okay? And when we are finished, let\u2019s have a drink together. You can hold your alcohol, right? It would be a waste not to enjoy this good night, so I will entertain you.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cI can hold it a bit. I will happily accompany you.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>(Senpai looks like she can hold her alcohol really well. I don\u2019t think she will force me to drink, so I will just order some tea before anything happens.) (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Whether she knows how Makoto feels or not, Hibiki pushes the word that this is a serious match.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Makoto was already worried about the events after the match.</p><br/><p>Distance was taken between the two.</p><br/><p>Maybe because they took in consideration that Makoto\u2019s weapon is a bow, the two of them had taken quite a lot of distance compared to a fight with swords.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026let\u2019s begin.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>A short exchange.</p><br/><p>But the tension in the place increased in an instant.</p><br/><p>Hibiki summons Horn from her silver belt, and immediately activates her serious equipment.</p><br/><p>Horn and the silver belt that were shining strongly, hid in a small area of Hibiki\u2019s body and protected it.</p><br/><p>The invisible defensive field that was created by the sacred treasure provided high endurance to Hibiki.</p><br/><p>At the same time, her speed is buffed, and the bastard sword she unsheathed stacks even more speed into that equation.</p><br/><p>(At any rate, she is a specialist in speed and power huh. Just as I saw in Meiris Lake. The type that if you can\u2019t catch her, you can\u2019t do anything about. Her defensive power is decent, and that exposure rate is for speed sake. How through, or more like, on top of that, she is using body strengthening as well. So a full boosted Senpai will be going with her all from the start huh.) (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Makoto took his bow into his hands, activated his Magic Armor, and was checking the movements of Hibiki.</p><br/><p>And then, he was sure she was a suitable opponent.</p><br/><p>After he achieved Creation at the demon race territory, Makoto slightly noticed something regarding his own image.</p><br/><p>To test it, there just\u2026wasn\u2019t a suitable opponent for it.</p><br/><p>Makoto was going to try and test it with Hibiki.</p><br/><p>He doesn\u2019t intend to take her life.</p><br/><p>He doesn\u2019t intend to leave her deeply injured either.</p><br/><p>Thinking that, Makoto was able to accept the \u2018serious match\u2019 of Hibiki.</p><br/><p>(Bows will shoot the arrow straight; leaving aside magic arrows that are created from Brid, if it\u2019s a physical arrow, I had a preconceived notion that it worked this way. I think that maybe in this world, I will be able to do even more incredible things.) (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Fuh!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Holding the bastard sword in one hand like that of a japanese katana, Hibiki swung her sword at Makoto.</p><br/><p>(\u2026An Iai?! No, a sword wave.) (Makoto)</p><br/><p>The sword wave changed colors faintly and launched towards Makoto.</p><br/><p>Of course, that was blocked by Makoto\u2019s Magic Armor and disappeared.</p><br/><p>However, because of the impact and the dust, Makoto\u2019s field of vision was blocked.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>(It was like an Iai. To shoot a sword wave, that\u2019s incredibly hero-like.) (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Without getting agitated, Makoto lifted his bow and takes an arrow with his right hand.</p><br/><p>With no stance and simply in a standby posture, he waits for the next move of Hibiki.</p><br/><p>Attacks struck the Magic Armor of Makoto from the back, left, right, and right again.</p><br/><p>(She was able to shorten the distance this much already. She is probably faster than the wolves in Asora.) (Makoto)</p><br/><p>He was in a state where his field of vision had not recovered yet, and was exposed to the continuous attacks of Hibiki.</p><br/><p>But they were all stopped by the Magic Armor and couldn\u2019t reach Makoto.</p><br/><p>There was no agitation felt in the sword of Hibiki, the space between the attacks steadily opened, and it felt as if she was analyzing it.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, there she is.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat an incredible defense!\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Right in front of Makoto was Hibiki.</p><br/><p>With her body slightly bend down, she slashes at Makoto without hesitating.</p><br/><p>That attack cuts the invisible Magic Armor.</p><br/><p>Being endowed with magic power and counting its speed, it was an attack that Makoto couldn\u2019t follow with his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though you have no scabbard, how can you do an Iai?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cI just use the wind as my scabbard. I feel like I can finally do a proper attack\u2014?!!\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Hibiki\u2019s next attack was crushed before it was activated.</p><br/><p>Makoto reformed the arm of the Magic Armor and leaving it to raw power, he struck her to the ground.</p><br/><p>Being held down just like that, Hibiki\u2019s movements stop.</p><br/><p>Even so, she hasn\u2019t released her sword.</p><br/><p>\u201cWind as a scabbard? What kind of idea is that?!\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cGuh!! Even though I certainly did feel like it worked, and yet, damn it!!\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>The Magic Armor of Makoto broke again.</p><br/><p>The arm of the Magic Armor that Makoto can see \u2013the arm that was holding down Hibiki\u2013 was pierced by something, and from there, the composition of the arm was destroyed.</p><br/><p>(Was it shot down? No, Senpai is not using something like that. She did something with her sword. But she is using her whole body and moving well! Restraining her will be hard.) (Makoto)</p><br/><p>While being surprised by the unknown powerful attack Hibiki released, Makoto was finally able to grasp the figure of Hibiki in his eyes.</p><br/><p>Placing an arrow, Makoto concentrates on Hibiki who\u2019s there.</p><br/><p>(I was somehow able to disperse that restrain by perforating it. Also, what held me down was probably the defense of Makoto-kun. In other words, if I use a stronger piercing attack, there\u2019s the chance that it can reach Makoto-kun. But, is it only at this level?) (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Makoto adjusted his aim at Hibiki. </p><br/><p>At that moment, Hibiki noticed.</p><br/><p>(I thought I would be able to evade his arrows, but if I remember correctly, he boasted an abnormal accuracy. And if it\u2019s like my Iai that utilizes wind and his ability has been enhanced in this world\u2026it is fine, even if it hits me, I will just have to strike it down the instant it touches my body.) (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>(I will brush away the arrow and cut down his defense with my Iai. Without putting any fronts, I will use my all to pierce it. But he is not moving. If he is not going to make any moves\u2026I will just have to bait him to!) (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Hibiki\u2019s figure disappears.</p><br/><p>Without caring about the presence of the dust, he doesn\u2019t try to follow her trace at all.</p><br/><p>The speed of Sofia and the speed of Hibiki are completely different.</p><br/><p>Hibiki mixes real moves and feints, and utilizes the eyes of the people and their senses to make the other party perceive it in a faster speed than normal.</p><br/><p>Just like how Lime saw it for the first time and lifted his hands in surrender, it could be said that it is an incredibly vicious technique.</p><br/><p>Different from the time when he was barely able to follow the moves of Sofia, in this case, Makoto had completely lifted his hands in surrender at the speed of Hibiki too.</p><br/><p>(As I thought, I can\u2019t see her at all. Nice. This is fine. It has to be this way.) (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Makoto closed his eyes, and the figure of Hibiki before she disappeared, appeared in his head.</p><br/><p>And then, he released his arrow at that image of hers.</p><br/><p>Makoto who opened his eyes, felt that his Magic Armor had been destroyed.</p><br/><p>The attack of Hibiki had increased in sharpness, and Makoto felt like the power was increasing more and more.</p><br/><p>It might be some sort of ability, but for the current him, that was a point that was of no importance.</p><br/><p>Without his Magic Armor, Makoto used Sakai without any expectations, and tried to grasp the location of Hibiki.</p><br/><p>At that place, there\u2019s Hibiki who has an arrow pierced at her right shoulder.</p><br/><p>Maybe because she had stopped her movements due of the pain, Makoto was able to grasp her location.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s how fast Hibiki was.</p><br/><p>And then, she took a surprising action.</p><br/><p>\u201cHer left hand?!\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Taking her sword again with her left hand, she forcefully released her trump card sword wave.</p><br/><p>The wave of attacks spiralled and advanced in a shape to pierce at Makoto.</p><br/><p>Makoto forgot to activate his Magic Armor for a second, and was entranced by it.</p><br/><p>(\u2026Doing an Iai with no scabbard, and be able to release a sword wave with that much power\u2026 Even though she is already outrageous by being able to do this much against an opponent that she can\u2019t attack properly, she is even able to use her sword waves as bullets\u2026 Just what\u2019s going through that head of hers? Oh right, first of all\u2026) (Makoto)</p><br/><p>The piercing attack of Hibiki that had already approached to his very eyes, the Magic Armor can\u2019t be completely activated in time.</p><br/><p>Only cladding the Armor at his right hand that was free, Makoto decided to take the piercing attack.</p><br/><p>Even though it is in an incomplete state, it was an attack of Hibiki that had reached Makoto for the first time.</p><br/><p>The right hand that was placed at his front made contact with the sword wave that\u2019s clad in Hibiki\u2019s magic power.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026This is\u2026strong!!\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>At first, Makoto was thinking about crushing it in his hands, but understanding that it would be hard to do, he tried to shift its trajectory forcefully with his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201c!! He stopped the wave with his hand?!\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cShiaaa!\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>The right hand of Makoto deviated the attack, piercing the ground and making a thunderous sound.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOuch ouch\u2026 Sorry but I don\u2019t think that I can fight anymore. I give up.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Makoto waves his hand as if in pain.</p><br/><p>From that hand, red blood was flowing.</p><br/><p>Mio who saw the injury of Makoto, had her brows twitch up, but that\u2019s all she did and didn\u2019t make any move.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I also can\u2019t continue it seems. It is a draw huh, Raidou-dono.\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>(I couldn\u2019t tell when it pierced me at all. If it had been in my head, I would have died without knowing what happened. The vessel of power is different huh. For Makoto-kun, I\u2019m not even an opponent that\u2019s worthy of fighting. Being this overwhelming, it even makes my will to compete wane.) (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Hibiki takes out the arrow that was pierced in her shoulder, and a healing light came from the red stain.</p><br/><p>Without being able to understand what Makoto did at all.</p><br/><p>Makoto practically didn\u2019t move his bow at all and didn\u2019t even turn around, and yet, it ended this way.</p><br/><p>The only proper moving he did was when he prepared his arrow, and when he grabbed the sword wave of hers.</p><br/><p>Hibiki understood that it was her defeat.</p><br/><p>And on top of that, while being irritated by Makoto who looked like he was planning on losing from the very beginning, she declared a draw.</p><br/><p>Announcing his defeat after doing something like that and not doing a follow-up attack, even Hibiki didn\u2019t find it pleasant.</p><br/><p>While holding bitter feelings inside herself, Hibiki ended the match with Makoto.</p><br/><p>(To think that it would even replicate the place it had pierced in the image\u2026 I see. The reason why I needed more time in order to increase my concentration was maybe because the difficulty of it was high? Even so, at that time, I was directing it towards the image of Senpai that was at that place, and yet, it hit Senpai who was leaping around the area, just as I pictured. I have finally reached a point that\u2019s not archery, but something really sketchy. I don\u2019t think this will be enough against the Goddess, but I have gotten a bit of confidence.)

At any rate, those are quite the strong attacks. It doesn\u2019t even compare to last time\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 That\u2019s obvious! This is\u2014\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe power of dragons huh. Taking into account the aria, did you borrow the power of another superior dragon?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about this?!\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>Not even an answer.</p><br/><p>The figure of Sofia disappears.</p><br/><p>It must be her prided teleportation.</p><br/><p>Just that, it is slightly different from before.</p><br/><p>At that time, she was exchanging her position with swords, but it looked like she is currently using a different method to teleport.</p><br/><p>Is it the power of a shadow dragon or something?</p><br/><p>Diagonally to my front, at mid-air, I feel her presence.</p><br/><p>As if shouldering her back, she prepares her sword and around her chest there\u2019s a red sphere.</p><br/><p>A long distance attack?</p><br/><p>Sofia swings her sword diagonally and leaves a trail.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the red sphere turns into something similar to a laser and heads towards me.</p><br/><p>I reflexively use the magic power body\u2019s hand to stop it.</p><br/><p>Crush it and erase it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph~ it was like a laser. Is that the power of the fire dragon that you mentioned in your aria? When talking about a fire superior dragon, it would be the crimson fire dragon \u201cCrimson Light Akari\u201d huh\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 This didn\u2019t work either. Crimson Light is the one that holds the strongest attack power among the dragon race though\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>The Dragon Slayer that landed glares at me with intense eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember being hated by a dragon though\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Actually, I am being liked way too much by a dragon that has both sexes and it\u2019s even troubling me.</p><br/><p>\u201cAra, don\u2019t worry. It is not like Raidou is being hated!\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>Without learning, she charges at me again.</p><br/><p>While repelling, I also launch my own attack.</p><br/><p>\u201c!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The fist is evaded once again and, from the surface of that fist, a magic formation expands. From there, a laser type of attack like the one Sofia used, was shot.</p><br/><p>But\u2026 Tch.</p><br/><p>It was a surprise attack, and yet, she was able to block it with her sword.</p><br/><p>As always, she has crazy intuition and an unbelievable sword.</p><br/><p>But there\u2019s no need to care about that.</p><br/><p>This magic power body also serves the purpose of strengthening my spells.</p><br/><p>Actually, that\u2019s its main purpose.</p><br/><p>I contain the magic power that has come out from my body in my surrounding.</p><br/><p>Set [Sakai] at perception.</p><br/><p>Because if it\u2019s her attack power, there\u2019s no need to use strengthening even if her power increases by double after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about, this?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I look at where Sofia has taken distance, and make a short aria.</p><br/><p>Several ripples appear from the front part of the magic power body.</p><br/><p>Balls the size of fingers detach from the human shape and float.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that, a defense mechanism?\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>Maybe she understood what I intended to do, Sofia mutters as if groaning.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is not only that right, Sofia?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Immediately after the balls trembled slightly\u2026</p><br/><p>An attack similar to the laser from before was shot in several small lines towards Sofia.</p><br/><p>Bundles of light that were no fewer than hundred were heading at Sofia, but she uses her usual teleportation to evade it.</p><br/><p>But that\u2019s futile.</p><br/><p>Her teleportation isn\u2019t the type that lets her escape into a different space.</p><br/><p>She is just moving to a different location.</p><br/><p>On top of that, from what I have seen, there\u2019s quite the limitation in distance.</p><br/><p>Yeah.</p><br/><p>There she is.</p><br/><p>With [Sakai], I find Sofia hiding under cover.</p><br/><p>To all the lights that were heading against a wall because they lost their target\u2026 I tell them her location.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey curved?!\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>All of the lights changed their direction and lunged towards the mountain of rubble that Sofia was hiding in.</p><br/><p>Curving a laser type attack.</p><br/><p>It is one of the dreams of men. Natto missile is also good.</p><br/><p>The voice of Rona that I heard from the back was dyed in surprise.</p><br/><p>Homing trait isn\u2019t that unusual of a thing though.</p><br/><p>What I did just now wasn\u2019t homing but something close to adding a new input. It doesn\u2019t look that different though.</p><br/><p>An explosion.</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t tell the location of Sofia.</p><br/><p>There must have been some damage there.</p><br/><p>I turn to my back.</p><br/><p>Io and Rona were looking at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cIo, you should release that dangerous stance. If you are going to get in the way, I will be taking proper steps\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cI think that our fight is still in progress though\u201d (Io)</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. I did warn you, okay?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cRaidou, that thing there, is it all your magic power?\u201d (Rona)</p><br/><p>\u201cRona, I don\u2019t have any intentions to answer that. But I will give you an advice. Quickly pull back your personnel from Stella. It looks like I will be finishing this soon\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Io was facing me and showing a stance.</p><br/><p>He is the same type as Sofia, so doing a joint front is difficult.</p><br/><p>And yet, he is still trying to join into my fight with Sofia.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, right. You did have such an attack right, Raidou?\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>Oya?</p><br/><p>From inside the smoke, Sofia was standing.</p><br/><p>I thought that she wasn\u2019t unscathed though.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are practically like Io. Did you learn regeneration? How about calling Lancer?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cI am calling him. It doesn\u2019t seem like he is listening though. Looks like your servant is not letting him go, you know?\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh~, I see. Then let\u2019s finish this already, Sofia\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 4 superior dragons\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>\u201cHah?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is not only Mitsurugi and Waterfall like last time. I was elated by that time with the lake, so I also ate Darkness Clad and Crimson Light\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>Ate?</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t obtain the cooperation of the superior dragons?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI noticed, the ability to eat the power of the dragons and assimilate it. I can brag about being the strongest among adventurers, but adding to that, I have also obtained the power of 4 superior dragons. I have enough power to destroy even a country\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>A country?</p><br/><p>With only this level?</p><br/><p>\u201cNext would be the Sand Wave Sazanami and the Invincible. If I kill those two, I would be able to reach the stage where I can devour Myriad Colors as well\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>From the superior dragons I know of, those are all of them huh.</p><br/><p>Among the 7 superior dragons, 4 are already within herself, and yet, she isn\u2019t able to touch me. It must be quite the shock for her.</p><br/><p>Also\u2026 Root.</p><br/><p>Looks like her objective has something to do with Root, but\u2026 do I have to carry his destiny as well?</p><br/><p>I will complain to him about this later.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow exaggerated. You are able to destroy a country with only this level of power?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cPlenty enough. That Io over there as well. He is able to destroy a small country. An army is just a power that weaklings flock to. For you and me, those kind of things just serve as targets. The power of individuals, that itself is national power\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Is that, how it works?</p><br/><p>No well, I thought that individuals would be powerless against a flock like an army though.</p><br/><p>Certainly.</p><br/><p>When looking at this town\u2019s situation and the progress of the battle, I did think: \u2018Is this all they have?\u2019.</p><br/><p>Even if it\u2019s a surprise attack, I wondered if this is the extent of armies and knight corps.</p><br/><p>This world might be a lot \u2018weaker\u2019 than I originally thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeriously. Having scales coming from my skin is just unsightly. How dare you\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>Sofia\u2019s power increased a step higher.</p><br/><p>The 4 colored powers that were residing in her body as well as her own power, it looked like they were merging and turning into some sort of marble pattern.</p><br/><p>The color of her skin darkens slightly.</p><br/><p>Just like how she said, I could faintly see scale-looking things.</p><br/><p>Her nails lengthened and her eyes changed like the ones of Tomoe which were close to the vestiges of a dragon.</p><br/><p>Instead of a Dragon Slayer, she looks more like a Dragon Kin now.</p><br/><p>\u201cA transformation? I don\u2019t know about Graunt, but I don\u2019t think you would be able to defeat Shen and Root\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c?! Shen and Root. It seems like the things I will have Raidou open his mouth for have increased\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>\u201cFor you, that will be impossible\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cLeaving aside the Invincible Shen, the name of the Myriad Color superior dragon is known by practically no one. I will have you tell me a lot of things. Before you die, that is!\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. Lately, I have been eating quite a lot with him though\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cJust how long can you keep that condescending tone?!\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>Sofia touches the magic power body.</p><br/><p>Just how many times will you do the same thing?</p><br/><p>No.</p><br/><p>She touched the human shape without holding a sword.</p><br/><p>At the same time that I was thinking what she was intending to do, from Sofia\u2019s hand, a pitch black mud-like darkness was spouted out.</p><br/><p>I could tell that the darkness that was sticking to the magic power body was declining its strength at those portions.</p><br/><p>The sword of Sofia that shone remarkably stronger, accurately makes a flash at the black marking.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh~\u201d</p><br/><p>While raising my voice, I include an attack against Sofia.</p><br/><p>Making several magic compositions, I fire it off from the human shape.</p><br/><p>Spear spheres.</p><br/><p>Firing off several attacks, they also did hit the target, but\u2026</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t stop.</p><br/><p>Maybe she activated an instantaneous healing magic, she is cutting and cutting and cutting at me without caring.</p><br/><p>While covering only her vitals and her right hand, she recovers everything that injures her.</p><br/><p>It seems like she has judged that this is the moment to decide the battle.</p><br/><p>Oh.</p><br/><p>At this moment Io is coming too huh.</p><br/><p>I can tell that Io is charging at me from behind.</p><br/><p>I have [Sakai] expanded with perception, so I can stop surprise attacks.</p><br/><p>It seems like Rona is trying to stop him though.</p><br/><p>Like Sofia, Io must have thought that this was the chance.</p><br/><p>\u201cRaidou, don\u2019t think bad of m\u2014\u201d (Io)</p><br/><p>\u201cIo, why don\u2019t you return? I will kill you, you know? Last time was advice, this time, it is a warning\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I firmly look at Io and tell him this.</p><br/><p>The binded Io.</p><br/><p>He is being grabbed by the hand of the human shape.</p><br/><p>A third arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cWa?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust because it is hyuman shaped, that doesn\u2019t mean it will only be restricted to 2 arms. Even you have 4 arms after all\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Straightforward.</p><br/><p>Facing the starry sky, I lift him up.</p><br/><p>After an advance notice that I will kill him if he returns.</p><br/><p>Well, he will most likely not return though.</p><br/><p>\u201cRocket Punch, just kidding\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cUoooo?!!!\u201d (Io)</p><br/><p>I cut off the arm and shoot it out at high speed.</p><br/><p>The grabbed Io was unable to shake it off and while still struggling, he disappeared into the starry sky.</p><br/><p>He was slightly valuable to kill, so well, no matter where he falls, he will most likely be able to repatriate.</p><br/><p>I did release him towards Stella so there should be no problems.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look away!!\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>Along with Sofia\u2019s words, she makes a swipe with all her might.</p><br/><p>Ah, this one will be hard to maintain.</p><br/><p>It has black markings placed here and there after all.</p><br/><p>Kii\u2014n!!!</p><br/><p>An ear-piercing sound.</p><br/><p>The human shape broke.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith this-!!\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>Well.</p><br/><p>Gagih\u2014!!</p><br/><p>\u201c!!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>I never said that I can\u2019t reconstruct it though.</p><br/><p>The reality that what she destroyed had appeared in an instant again and blocked her sword; without letting escape that moment of disturbance by the reconstruction, I grab Sofia with the hand of the human shape.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder, just how good is your defensive power in that form?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>The fist that grasped her tightly, releases heat along with light, and explodes.</p><br/><p>\u201cAaaaah!!\u201d</p><br/><p>A serious scream of pain.</p><br/><p>This is the first time I have heard the voice of Sofia sounding like this.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6</p><br/><p>Looking at the fight occurring right in front of me, I felt fear.</p><br/><p>An emotion close to pure terror.</p><br/><p>Io who saw as if Raidou was being pushed back, decided to join the battle as well.</p><br/><p>But, he was dealt with in an instant.</p><br/><p>The strongest general from our prided army was.</p><br/><p>It was something that happened not too long ago.</p><br/><p>The hyuman shaped magic power of Raidou grew a third arm from around the armpit and grabbed Io, and just like that, it separated from the body and flew to the sky.</p><br/><p>Io is unable to use teleportation.</p><br/><p>I see. From a realistic standpoint, he has been shut out of this fight.</p><br/><p>If Raidou uses a hand like that, Io has no way of doing anything against it. </p><br/><p>If I go look for him, it might be possible to rejoin the battle, but it is a reality that 2 demon generals are unable to compare in any way.</p><br/><p>It is simply a bad situation.</p><br/><p>Just one thing, what I am hoping is that, Raidou\u2019s trump card is that magic power body.</p><br/><p>It is certainly true that that thing is troublesome.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a mass of magic power that can even put spells to use. With a simple aria, it can activate the spells in an instant.</p><br/><p>Moreover, as long as he has magic power, it seems like it can even regenerate.</p><br/><p>Just by being able to construct such a magic power body, it is proof that he possesses an amount of magic power that rivals the scale of a country.</p><br/><p>It doesn\u2019t seem like it is a pure object, so I don\u2019t know about the conversion performance, it might even be slightly better than the one I know of. But the truth is that, this is a literal threat.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom the demon race experiments, a normal magician would have to use all its magic power just to make a single grain of sand. He is able to make such a mass and materialize it strongly enough to defend against attacks of a Dragon Slayer. In that case\u2026\u201d (Rona)</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no doubt that it is an amount of magic power that she doesn\u2019t even feel like calculating.</p><br/><p>But in the end, it is magic power.</p><br/><p>If it is with my trump card, it is quite good against it.</p><br/><p>Even if it\u2019s Raidou, there should be a way to fight it.</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s now, I can also expect the support of Sofia.</p><br/><p>That is exactly the reason why I am still here.</p><br/><p>For the demon race, the Dragon Slayer and that boy will become a threat the moment they turn into enemies.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why, if I can eliminate at least one\u2026</p><br/><p>That\u2019s how it is.</p><br/><p>It is originally a special attack of mine that needs the permission of my Lord before using, but as expected, right now I have no leeway to fill the forms.</p><br/><p>Silently\u2026</p><br/><p>I begin my preparations.</p><br/><p>I connect my aria and without the two noticing me\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cRona, I don\u2019t know what you intend to do but, if you continue forming your spell\u2026 I will crush you\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c?!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Raidou!</p><br/><p>That guy, at this distance\u2026</p><br/><p>Without even turning this way, he warned me.</p><br/><p>Now that I remember, when we were confronting each other for fun at the academy, he was strangely able to predict my attacks.</p><br/><p>Different from the other students, my habits shouldn\u2019t have been read, and yet\u2026</p><br/><p>I feel a cold sweat running down my spine.</p><br/><p>Just a few days ago, the last time we talked and I thought he was as naive as always, in just that small amount of time, did something happen to Raidou?</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t understand.</p><br/><p>But, the reality that he made such a change is important.</p><br/><p>At the very least, he is not someone that can be rolled in the palm of my hand at the battlefield anymore.</p><br/><p>I send saliva to my dried throat.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s completely dry.</p><br/><p>I can feel the fear that I hadn\u2019t felt for so long swelling up inside me.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t the time to be concerned about this.</p><br/><p>As if hiding the fact that I have yielded to fear, I began to line up several reasons to negate the antagonism towards him.</p><br/><p>With thought transmission, I am able to grasp the general location of Io.</p><br/><p>He has quite the distance, but it isn\u2019t at the level where I can\u2019t go look for him.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>It is the time to step back.</p><br/><p>If what Sofia says is true, she has the power of 4 superior dragons and has released the power to the point that her hyuman shape has begun to change.</p><br/><p>Blade Dragon\u2019s sword, Fire Dragon\u2019s flame, Water Dragon\u2019s healing and support, Shadow Dragon\u2019s special ability.</p><br/><p>It is certainly true that it is power that could bring down a country.</p><br/><p>But with a fresh face and with literally no sweat, Raidou was confronting her.</p><br/><p>He is also\u2026</p><br/><p>No, he is way too much of an unknown number.</p><br/><p>At the very least, I have been underestimating him way too much.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was a joke, Raidou\u201d (Rona)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I see\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Your conditions were to give up on the hero and Stella Fortress, right? Okay. I don\u2019t know about Sofia, but Io and I will accept those conditions. We will withdraw\u201d (Rona)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd the condition is?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Raidou looks at me.</p><br/><p>While confronting Sofia, he has the leeway to look away as many times as he wants.</p><br/><p>To think it was to this extent\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no condition. You will meet with Demon Lord-sama, right?\u201d (Rona)</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. I do want to talk with that person at least once after all\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s plenty enough. That girl is a vice-general, but doesn\u2019t lead any army. I will be leaving her here but, you don\u2019t mind, right?\u201d (Rona)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I can\u2019t assure you her safety\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. It seems like she doesn\u2019t intend to stop fighting even after hearing this talk, so I will just accept it as an outcome of the battlefield\u201d (Rona)</p><br/><p>\u201cThen go ahead. Let me tell you this just in case. If you intend to place a hand on the hero, Shiki is also outside\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cI am not so stupid. Well then, excuse me\u201d (Rona)</p><br/><p>Scary.</p><br/><p>Leaving the place and heading to where Io was, this single thought surfaced in my mind.</p><br/><p>Raidou is the Devil.</p><br/><p>Even if it\u2019s not a name he called himself with, it is a nickname that truly fits him.</p><br/><p>This is what I thought as I was finally able to wipe the sweat off my face.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 It looks as if the sword is adhered to your hand though?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is originally like the crystallization of Mitsurugi\u2019s power. The stronger I release my dragon power like this, it turns closer and closer to fusing\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>In the audience room that now only she and I remain, Sofia once again stands up, clads herself in blue light, and heals her wounds.</p><br/><p>In those eyes, there\u2019s still fighting spirit.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know, why don\u2019t you leave that fighting style of slowly shaving off your cards to someone that is weaker than you? Or are you thinking that I won\u2019t be killing you?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>If that\u2019s how it is, Sofia would be the naive one.</p><br/><p>Because I do intend to kill her.</p><br/><p>The moment she reacted to the name Shen, she revealed the intentions of devouring Tomoe as well.</p><br/><p>Even if her ability is insufficient, there\u2019s no reason to let her leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am not in the age where I dream about fighting in a battlefield without being killed. You as well, aren\u2019t your attacks lacking in power more than the Empire\u2019s hero?\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>The Empire\u2019s hero?</p><br/><p>Why did his name come out so suddenly?</p><br/><p>It seems like she let him go though.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho knows. I have never met the Empire\u2019s hero. And there\u2019s no need to decide the fight in one attack, right? Go ahead and utilize each one of your cards\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Just because you are in an advantage\u2026 you are being sarcastic\u2026 As I thought, that kid there was at least cuter than you\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat kid\u2019s attack was incredible you know? Shadow dragon and Water dragon; I was somehow able to endure it by utilizing two dragons at full power. It wasn\u2019t to the point that I had to use this form, but it was higher than you though\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe does think about his companions, and he also had the resolve to shave off his own life in order to reach his objective\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I was asked who I wanted to work together with\u2014\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. The Empire\u2019s hero is surely impressive\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>\u201cHe was even able to use his charm power against an out of standard woman like you. On top of that, even if it was somewhat, he firmly left an impetus. If he meets you a number of times more, it may even reach perfection\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c?!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was as if she didn\u2019t notice at all. Her expression dyes in surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha, you didn\u2019t notice huh. It seems like you were unable to completely resist it, you know? Iya, as expected of a hero. If it were me, I wouldn\u2019t even think about making you a companion\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Finding a fragment of magic power that was confined inside of Sofia, I felt admiration.</p><br/><p>To think that he was able to charm Sofia.</p><br/><p>That Empire hero, he doesn\u2019t care as long as it is a beautiful girl?</p><br/><p>I should properly make countermeasures so that it doesn\u2019t create victims at Asora as well.</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s a power that can work even against Sofia, it is quite the threat.</p><br/><p>\u201cCh-arm? Me? You, what are you\u2026\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou overlooked it huh. I wonder, maybe the true reason you didn\u2019t kill the hero was because you fell in love with him? Fufufu, a Dragon Slayer did\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs a sign of pity, that charm, want me to dispel it for you?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Even if she is charmed, it doesn\u2019t affect my battle with her.</p><br/><p>But.</p><br/><p>Seeing her flattering the Empire hero at random, she looked like a buffoon.</p><br/><p>Sofia is not a threat that I need to stay cold to deal with.</p><br/><p>Is it conceit, or maybe confidence?</p><br/><p>I just felt pity for her.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Shut up\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry. I won\u2019t do anything strange. How about it, can you let me eliminate that charm? Dispel magic is safe magic you know?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I told you to shut up\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd it seems like it is already something you can\u2019t do by yourself after all. Even if you wait, it won\u2019t turn into an advantageous development for you, you know?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat mouth of yours\u2026\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>\u201cHey\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>The moment I was about to continue my words\u2026</p><br/><p>The back of Sofia burned.</p><br/><p>No, it isn\u2019t burning.</p><br/><p>Flames shaped as dragon wings were spread.</p><br/><p>\u201cShut it up!!!\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>Her figure!</p><br/><p>Teleportation?!</p><br/><p>No\u2026 it is not!</p><br/><p>It is simply at a speed I can\u2019t catch with my eyes.</p><br/><p>I look above.</p><br/><p>A red trail as if drawing a line.</p><br/><p>It is moving freely from left to right.</p><br/><p>High speed movement.</p><br/><p>So she still had such a card in hand huh.</p><br/><p>She really does have a lot of tricks up her sleeve.</p><br/><p>From several locations of the magic power body, the marks of cuts and black stains were being left.</p><br/><p>Sofia who talked a lot, at this moment, she continued her attacks without saying a word.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Fuh~\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen Mitsurugi returns, you are done for\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>Hm, she talked.</p><br/><p>But, that\u2019s off the point.</p><br/><p>No, maybe the \u2018others\u2019 are just way too out of standards?</p><br/><p>\u201cMitsurugi -Lancer \u2013 won\u2019t be returning. If you who has the power of several superior dragons is only at this level, then\u2026 our Shiki is a lot stronger than that Lancer\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right.</p><br/><p>While receiving the slashes I can\u2019t see, I held confidence and answered Sofia.</p><br/><p>At the same time, I told Shiki who has been sending me thought transmissions several times to ask for permissions:</p><br/><p>\u2018Do as you wish\u2019</p><br/>\n</div>"}

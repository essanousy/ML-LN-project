The faint fragrance of her hair is making me feel at ease.</p><br/><p>Japan, the wastelands, Tsige...</p><br/><p>No matter the topic, Senpai nods as if she\u2019s enjoying herself. She told me all kinds of things about her party.</p><br/><p>Things like how her male knight\u2019s growth is promising but unreliable.</p><br/><p>Or how she respects the girl who faces her duties as a priestess head on, even though she is still small.</p><br/><p>Or how when she watches the male mage who\u2019s married, she realizes that even in another world, even if the husband is strong, men are still controlled by their wives.</p><br/><p>She\u2019s surrounded by enjoyable companions and things in her country are apparently going well, for the most part.</p><br/><p>As one would expect.</p><br/><p>In the Limia Kingdom, there have recently been cries for... something like democracy? I\u2019ve heard a little about people voicing their dissent at the idea of nobles being treated as superior. Senpai tells me they\u2019ve been gathering followers and slowly making their plans.</p><br/><p>Doesn\u2019t this mean that she\u2019s involved in politics as well? I\u2019m honestly surprised.</p><br/><p>As I thought, someone who\u2019s been a hero from the start and has become a key figure in the country is really something else.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m starting to get curious about the other hero as well.</p><br/><p>Hibiki-senpai hasn\u2019t given me too many details about him.</p><br/><p>She told me it\u2019s best if I meet him and talk to him myself.</p><br/><p>However, when we were talking about the hero of the empire\u2019s power of charming, Senpai\u2019s expression changed.</p><br/><p>It became a strange look that showed both surprise and agreement at the same time.</p><br/><p>Though it quickly changed back into a smile and our topic of conversation moved once more, so I didn\u2019t give it too much thought.</p><br/><p>Oh yeah.</p><br/><p>The question of how she met Beren and became close to him.</p><br/><p>It\u2019ll probably be good to hear it from Senpai herself.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m a little interested to know how outsiders other than myself perceive Beren.</p><br/><p>Our conversation about Tsige ended up switching topics to Tomoe and Mio as well as a lot of discussion about Rembrandt-san, so I didn\u2019t get to ask much about that kind of stuff.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, Hibiki-senpai. When you came to Tsige, how did you come to know Beren \u2013\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>BANG.</p><br/><p>\u300cEh?\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>I let out a stupid-sounding voice in response to the violent opening of the door.</p><br/><p>Standing there, holding a tray of drinks is... Mio.</p><br/><p>Huh, Mio didn\u2019t have to bring them herself; she could\u2019ve had someone else bring them.</p><br/><p>Wait, Tomoe is there as well.</p><br/><p>She suddenly pokes her head out from behind Mio with a smile.</p><br/><p>Mio is kind of... really angry?</p><br/><p>I mean, her eyes have a glassy look.</p><br/><p>Her reaction to seeing me talking with other women has become calmer lately, but is she throwing some sort of fit?</p><br/><p>\u300cYou two, I\u2019m with a visitor. What is it, all of a sudden?\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cMy apologies, Waka. I said to Mio that we should wait at least until your thighs were touching, but it seems that your shoulders were the limit for her.\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Tomoe continues smiling as she directs her eyes at the gap between me and Senpai.</p><br/><p>Thighs?</p><br/><p>Shoulders?</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Uoh!</p><br/><p>Now that she mentions it, I look to see what she\u2019s talking about. Senpai was initially just sitting next to me, but now she\u2019s really close to me.</p><br/><p>Our shoulders are indeed touching!</p><br/><p>I was so engrossed in our conversation that I didn\u2019t notice!</p><br/><p>For us to have been talking while this close without me noticing, I feel like I\u2019ve been rude towards Senpai...</p><br/><p>In any case, now that I\u2019ve noticed, I put some normal distance between us.</p><br/><p>Even if Mio wasn\u2019t having a fit, these are indeed circumstances that would make her angry, yes.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t have that kind of relationship with Senpai, and we weren\u2019t talking about anything romantic.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, err. Sorry, I didn\u2019t notice that kind of thing because I was so caught up in our conversation. I need to apologize to you as well, Hibiki-senpai.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300c...\u300d(Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Huh?</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no response from Senpai.</p><br/><p>She\u2019s looking at Mio.</p><br/><p>\u300c... Hibiki, it\u2019s been a while, hasn\u2019t it?\u300d(Mio)</p><br/><p>Mio?</p><br/><p>You know Senpai?</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no way that\u2019s the case, huh.</p><br/><p>They\u2019ve never been in contact with each other.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt has been some time, Mio-san. Because Raidou-san turned out to be Misumi-kun, I was half in doubt, but I suppose \u201cWaka-sama\u201d is referring to him after all.\u300d(Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u300cYou don\u2019t need to tell me why you\u2019re here. But I didn\u2019t think you were the kind of girl who repaid kindness with ingratitude, you know, Hibiki? I\u2019m grateful for your help with cooking, so I\u2019ll let you choose. Your left arm or your right. Which of them do you not need?\u300d(Mio)</p><br/><p>?!</p><br/><p>Arm?!</p><br/><p>\u300cMio! I was careless! Calm down! This person is my senpai, we came from the same hometown. We just got nostalgic and caught up in talking about the past, that\u2019s all, I\u2019m telling you!\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>What a dangerous thing she is saying!</p><br/><p>This isn\u2019t her usual light-hearted anger.</p><br/><p>It seems that Senpai and Mio are acquainted with each other, but what is this?</p><br/><p>And what did she mean by \u201chelp with cooking\u201d?</p><br/><p>... Cooking.</p><br/><p>If I recall, I heard from Mio that she learned some recipes similar to Japanese-style food from an adventurer in Tsige.</p><br/><p>But Senpai didn\u2019t say a single word about...</p><br/><p>Hmm?</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, Mio earnestly... Wait, give me this tray.\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>As Tomoe says this, she takes the tray that Mio is holding in silence.</p><br/><p>Oh, Tomoe and Mio have different degrees of enthusiasm.</p><br/><p>\u300cIf you\u2019re not answering, I\u2019ll tear off both of them.\u300d(Mio)</p><br/><p>\u300cMio, stop!\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>I\u2019ve been sitting between Senpai and Mio from the beginning, so I don\u2019t need to move.</p><br/><p>I stand up where I am and face Mio.</p><br/><p>Why does there have to be bloodshed over such a small thing?!</p><br/><p>I\u2019m living a more modest lifestyle than most men in this world, you know?!</p><br/><p>\u300c... Waka-sama.\u300d(Mio)</p><br/><p>Mio finally stops in her tracks.</p><br/><p>Even so, just by being in this room, Senpai is already within Mio\u2019s range.</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t relax.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll deploy my magic power armor in an invisible state so I can protect Senpai just in case.</p><br/><p>Senpai stands up quietly behind me.</p><br/><p>At that moment, I see the evening sun shining through the window.</p><br/><p>We started talking just after noon, so we talked for quite a while.</p><br/><p>\u300cMio-san, I had no intentions of doing anything to him. Despite my appearance, I am a hero after all. I don\u2019t have the time to be going out with a guy, anyway.\u300d(Hibiki)</p><br/><p>She\u2019s perfectly right.</p><br/><p>To be a hero and still have time to flirt with a lover, you\u2019d need to be very skillful indeed.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m not even one of her party members; if Senpai and I were to date, it would have to be a long-distance relationship, right?</p><br/><p>Not that there\u2019s any way Senpai would consider someone like me in the first place.</p><br/><p>\u300cHero? I couldn\u2019t care less about something like that. Hibiki, are you saying you have no interest at all? Your expression said differently earlier. Weren\u2019t you being quite flirtatious?\u300d(Mio)</p><br/><p>Couldn\u2019t care less, huh.</p><br/><p>Normally you\u2019d have more of a reaction to a girl standing before your eyes telling you \u201cI\u2019m a hero\u201d.</p><br/><p>However.</p><br/><p>Th-that\u2019s quite a cold tone.</p><br/><p>What do you mean by \u201cflirtatious\u201d, it\u2019s not like we\u2019re animals with an uncontrollable urge to breed.</p><br/><p>\u300cI was able to meet my cute kouhai, that\u2019s all. The sword that I received when I met you, Mio-san, I came to have it repaired and happened to meet him by coincidence.\u300d(Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u300cThat right! It was a coincidence! She is acquainted to you and Beren for some reason, and she happened to come to the Kuzunoha and ran into me by pure coincidence! Do you understand?\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300c... For over three hours?\u300d(Mio)</p><br/><p>\u300cUh, w-we got caught up in talking.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cWaka-sama, when there were meetings that went for three hours you would fall asleep. Yet you had an enjoyable conversation that you got caught up in for even longer than that?\u300d(Mio)</p><br/><p>Guh.</p><br/><p>The times I fell asleep just coincided with the times when I was the most busy, didn\u2019t they?</p><br/><p>Mio is being quite malicious today.</p><br/><p>But I\u2019m sorry.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll be careful.</p><br/><p>\u300cReally, I\u2019m sorry. I lost track of the time. This person and I have a senpai-kouhai relationship, nothing more.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cYes. We went to the same school, but we barely even knew each other\u2019s names. I was in quite a high social position in that world, so I got ahead of myself without thinking. I was being inconsiderate of you, Mio-san, I\u2019m sorry.\u300d(Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Hibiki-senpai lowers her head.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know the relationship between the two, but is Senpai the weaker one?</p><br/><p>If they met in Tsige, were Senpai and her party among the babysitters in the wasteland?</p><br/><p>I won\u2019t know if I don\u2019t ask about it later.</p><br/><p>Thought transmission is blocked, so I can\u2019t ask anyway?</p><br/><p>It\u2019s pretty hard to gain Mio\u2019s favor here.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m quite depressed.</p><br/><p>\u300c...\u300d(Mio)</p><br/><p>\u300cLook, you\u2019ve said this much to Waka already, you cannot be angry forever.\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Thanks, Tomoe.</p><br/><p>For some reason, thought transmission isn\u2019t working on you either, but I can assume you\u2019re not angry?</p><br/><p>\u300c... Waka-sama, Ema is calling. Also, there are a few things that I would like you to sample, so let us head to the mansion.\u300d(Mio)</p><br/><p>\u300cI-I see. Well, then, Senpai. Please take care on your way to Lorel.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300c... Yes. Joshua-sama wanted to get in touch with you, so would you please contact him in the near future?\u300d(Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, I understand. I\u2019ll do that in a few days\u2019 time.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cPlease do.\u300d(Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u300cWaka-sama!\u300d(Mio)</p><br/><p>Mio\u2019s voice is sharp.</p><br/><p>I have to hurry.</p><br/><p>\u300cLet us be on our way... He shouldn\u2019t have given her that sword, mumble mumble...\u300d(Mio)</p><br/><p>As I walk towards Mio and Tomoe, who are standing at the door that was wrenched open, Mio starts to rush me even more.</p><br/><p>She\u2019s saying something inappropriate, too.</p><br/><p>That sword of Beren\u2019s, Mio had something to do with it as well, huh.</p><br/><p>\u300cWaka, please leave the hero in my care. Allow me escort her back.\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u300cTomoe? I don\u2019t think you need to worry about Senpai that much, you know?\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cNo no, it is just that she is a guest of the Kuzunoha company. We must treat her properly. Lime is busy at the moment and I, fortunately, happen to have some free time.\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u300cHer left and right arms are off-limits, alright?\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cPlease do not treat me like I am the same as Mio. We will just have a small conversation. I will not harm her.\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u300cIn that case, I\u2019ll leave that to you.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cAs you wish.\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>It seems Tomoe isn\u2019t that angry, so I guess it should be fine.</p><br/><p>!</p><br/><p>Could she be planning to look through Senpai\u2019s memories?</p><br/><p>Senpai has knowledge on some things that I don\u2019t, so it\u2019s possible.</p><br/><p>Should I stop her?</p><br/><p>No.</p><br/><p>If the depths of Asora\u2019s knowledge isn\u2019t seen, then it won\u2019t be found, I suppose.</p><br/><p>... I wonder why.</p><br/><p>Maybe it\u2019s because all of my own memories have been exposed; I feel a little reluctant to let it happen to someone else.</p><br/><p>I have to change my way of thinking on these kinds of things.</p><br/><p>I leave the company room together with Mio and head for Asora.</p><br/><p>At this time of day, we can have a short break and still be able to return to the company before dinner, huh.</p><br/><p>We can close the shop and check our inventory then.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6</p><br/><p>TLN: This section is now switched to Tomoe\u2019s point of view, which is immediately apparent in Japanese but not in English, so I\u2019m leaving this TLN here to clarify that.</p><br/><p>Ooh.</p><br/><p>Organizing information is a hectic thing.</p><br/><p>Waka and Mio have returned to Asora, and I am accompanying the hero of Limia, Otonashi Hibiki, along the street as I told Waka I would.</p><br/><p>She was sitting so close to Waka in the drawing room, but she did not show any expression of having an ulterior motive. Finding out exactly what this girl gained from that conversation is one of my objectives.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m secretly looking through her memories, but from the conversation with Waka earlier, it seems she has gathered most of the available information about Waka as Raidou of the Kuzunoha company.</p><br/><p>\u300cErr, Tomoe-san? I\u2019ll be fine on my own.\u300d(Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u300cI am not sure if you are aware, hero-dono, but this city recently suffered great damage at the hands of monsters known as mutants. I cannot allow even the smallest chance of something happening to a guest of Waka\u2019s. Please forgive me.\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u300cI see... Umm, Tomoe-san, are you also one of Misumi-kun\u2019s subordinates?\u300d(Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u300cOf course. Ah yes, hero-dono, I think you have heard that Waka is using the false name, \u201cRaidou\u201d. When you refer to Waka, please use either Misumi or Raidou. Since using the name \u201cMakoto\u201d would only invite chaos.\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u300cI know. He told me the same. Well, I heard about this company that started in the wasteland, but you really do employ many demi-humans, don\u2019t you?\u300d(Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Hmm.</p><br/><p>To start with, I have been predominantly examining her memories of their earlier conversation.</p><br/><p>Waka, you said quite a lot.</p><br/><p>Though you were made to talk.</p><br/><p>You seemed to have excluded your relationship with the goddess, but you talked about the wasteland, Tsige and Rotsgard.</p><br/><p>You have given a considerable amount of information to this girl.</p><br/><p>You have managed to keep quiet about Shiki, who she is acquainted with, and Asora. But you have talked a great deal about the academy lecturers and the mutant attack.</p><br/><p>Hmm, Ilumgand?</p><br/><p>If I recall, that was the student that began the attack.</p><br/><p>It seems that she is quite concerned about him, but even Waka does not know everything about that matter.</p><br/><p>It seems that this girl, Hibiki, tried to learn something about that student but quickly gave up.</p><br/><p>Even we have not got a full grasp of their relationship.</p><br/><p>The students did about 80% of the damage, and Mio finished him off, huh?</p><br/><p>All Waka knows is that the students defeated him.</p><br/><p>The only ones who know about how he was finished are Mio and myself.</p><br/><p>I should poke around this topic.</p><br/><p>It would be troublesome if we allowed it to be an issue in the future.</p><br/><p>Whatever the case may be, I am relieved that they seem not to have touched on the topic of Waka and Shiki going wild in Limia.</p><br/><p>For some reason, in Hibiki\u2019s mind, she has decided that the person dressed in a white suit is a hyuman.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll find out how she came to that conclusion later.</p><br/><p>Because Hibiki believes Waka is a human, she believes them to be two different people.</p><br/><p>... But this is a little dangerous.</p><br/><p>Waka has given enough information to Hibiki that she could assume that his parents were hyumans.</p><br/><p>If we are not careful, she could come to that conclusion.</p><br/><p>\u300cWaka does not discriminate against demi-humans, so he can truly appreciate their great abilities. That is one reason. Since you are from the same town as him, hero-dono, would you not think the same?\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u300c... Yes, at first. But as I learn of this this world\u2019s customs and traditions, I realize that people who think like me are in the minority. I think that the relationship between humans and demi-humans is one of the problems that cause wars, but what we need to immediately deal with is the war that is happening right now. I will not condone the hyumans\u2019 attitude towards demi-humans, but I will not outright deny it, either.\u300d(Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u300cSo you tolerate their behavior.\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>That is a safe thing to do.</p><br/><p>Even though Waka and Hibiki both lived in Japan, they have quite different ways of thinking.</p><br/><p>\u300cThough my common sense still hinders me in that regard. For us, demi-humans are just people who have different features like a tail or ears. But hyumans view them as servants and... to say it bluntly, livestock.\u300d(Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, you have a point.\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u300cNo matter how beneficial demi-humans are to hyumans, hyumans rarely acknowledge the rights of demi-humans. I\u2019ve noticed recently that Misumi-kun treating demi-humans so well is causing him to be seen as some kind of unusual pet enthusiast. As a hero, it is difficult to conduct myself that way.\u300d(Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u300cFor someone who exudes charisma, that is quite a calculative thing to say, hero-dono.\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s exactly as you say. I am a calculative, shrewd person. The aristocracy in Limia must be reformed and the empire must be held back through diplomacy before I can raise the societal status of demi-humans. Of course, this is assuming that we win the war.\u300d(Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u300cYou desire a lot, hero-dono. You are different to what I imagined, but I do not dislike that. I see. Well, I can confirm that there was a passionate supporter in this city.\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>I suppose I will begin now.</p><br/><p>\u300cA supporter, you say? Supporting me? I am happy to hear that there are such people, even in this academy city that is so far from the kingdom.\u300d(Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u300cIndeed. He is deceased now, but he was an academy student. The second son of the Hoperaise* family from Limia, a boy by the name of Ilumgand. He had quite a troublesome personality, but he had considerable faith in you, hero-dono.\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>TLN*: Was previously translated by Reigokai as Hopelace</p><br/><p>\u300c!\u300d(Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u300cBut he was in quite a bad temper before the school festival. In the end, he turned into a monster during a team competition and began attacking the other students. If I recall, the king of your country also saw this incident.\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Hooh.</p><br/><p>So Ilumgand was acquainted with Hibiki.</p><br/><p>Fu, he is speaking of his ideals with shining, innocent eyes.</p><br/><p>They met when Hibiki was acting to remind the kingdom\u2019s nobles of their duties.</p><br/><p>The little I saw of Ilumgand was after he had already lost his sanity, but I understand now. The Ilumgand in Hibiki\u2019s memories is indeed a respectable young man.</p><br/><p>It seems that he was passionate about his ideals, enthusiastic in lectures and wanted to be of use to the hero once he graduated.</p><br/><p>Words coming from a face whose expression is full of admiration cannot be lies.</p><br/><p>I am curious as to why he turned insane and was killed.</p><br/><p>\u300c... Did Ilum-kun, Ilumgand, really do such coward-like acts, go on a rampage and finally get eliminated?\u300d(Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u300cThere is no mistake. Waka also saw it. There may have been a reason for it, but it was something that Ilumgand caused himself. His strange behavior prior to that is also known by other academy students and employees of the Kuzunoha company.\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u300cEven everyone in the Kuzunoha company?\u300d(Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u300cIndeed. Because for some reason, he saw Waka as his mortal enemy and interfered with his activities. He pressured the guild, used companies in Limia to harass Waka and even disturbed his students. I pity the students who were affected by that.\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u300c... He was one of my sympathizers. Among the nobles, he was a rare person who put proper thought towards the well-being of the people. The Hoperaise family is mourning his passing.\u300d(Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u300cOne\u2019s reputation can change many times in the eyes of the people. But if he had such a side to him, it is unfortunate that he was lost.\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u300cNo matter what, I can\u2019t bring myself to believe he transformed like that.\u300d(Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u300cBoth the academy and the kingdom of Limia are investigating the cause. I am sure the truth will be revealed eventually.\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u300cI think there was definitely something that caused it.\u300d(Hibiki)</p><br/><p>... She has no proof, but she believes there was a cause.</p><br/><p>Is it some kind of intuition?</p><br/><p>However, she is right.</p><br/><p>Whether she will have the chance to find out just what kind of intervention the demons are capable of is another matter.</p><br/><p>Fufu, and this is...</p><br/><p>I\u2019ve found something good.</p><br/><p>This girl has learned kendo and swordsmanship!</p><br/><p>This is good.</p><br/><p>I may be able to touch on real swordsmanship.</p><br/><p>\u300cHero-dono, if I recall, you were planning to be transferred from the academy?\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u300cHuh, ah, yes. That\u2019s right. Coming here was an independent decision that we made.\u300d(Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Hibiki is surprised by this abrupt change in conversation topic.</p><br/><p>But I am also surprised.</p><br/><p>Why did you and Waka learn swordsmanship from the same person?</p><br/><p>And neither you nor Waka are aware of this.</p><br/><p>I think I can see even more of their teacher\u2019s swordsmanship in her memories than Waka\u2019s.</p><br/><p>What a stroke of good fortune this is.</p><br/><p>\u300cFrom the fact that you left a sword in our care, can I assume that you are a master of the sword?\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u300cI don\u2019t have it with me, but I\u2019ve left a sword with the academy. Bastard swords are the easiest to use, aren\u2019t they?\u300d(Hibiki)</p><br/><p>I do not have any interest in such swords.</p><br/><p>\u300cSince you are from the same town as Waka, can you use a katana?\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u300cKatana...\u300d(Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Hibiki looks at the sword at my waist.</p><br/><p>Has she sensed it?</p><br/><p>I will not allow you to refuse.</p><br/><p>I did defend you from Mio, though only through words.</p><br/><p>\u300cI did learn how to use Japanese katanas in my hometown. Speaking of which, Tomoe-san, you give off the impression of a samurai. Are there samurai and Japanese katanas in this world as well?\u300d(Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, this is just a hobby of mine. Since learning about this from Waka, I have been completely caught up in it.\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u300cHobby? Huh, I see.\u300d(Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u300cI would like to humbly request instruction!\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u300cFrom me?! Err, if you are as strong as Mio-san, then you are far stronger than I am.\u300d(Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u300cA contest between swordswomen. I will prepare a katana for you. There are plenty of suitable places at the academy and I will not take much of your time!\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Techniques with a Japanese sword.</p><br/><p>I can see the details in Hibiki\u2019s memories, but nothing could be better than seeing it in person.</p><br/><p>\u300cBut I would like to hurry and meet up with everyone else...\u300d(Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u300cThen I shall escort you there after our contest! It is decided, let us go, hero-dono!\u300d(Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Muh!</p><br/><p>What do you mean by,\u300cShe is just a companion of Mio, they\u2019re two similar people\u300d?!</p><br/><p>How dare you remember something so rude!</p><br/><p>Even if I make selfish requests such as these, I make sure to prepare benefits for my opponents as well!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

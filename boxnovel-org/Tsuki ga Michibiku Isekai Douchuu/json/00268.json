I was thinking about putting out today\u2019s chapter yesterday, but I had business to attend to and couldn\u2019t manage to bring out 2 chapters.</p><br/><p>Again, really sorry!</p><br/><p>White as always.</p><br/><p>After the night passed, I had come to a place I wouldn\u2019t even imagine I would be a few hours ago.</p><br/><p>The outside is pure white.</p><br/><p>That place is, to my surprise\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI am truly sorry, Waka-sama! I am aware that you are in the middle of clearing the labyrinth of Lorel, but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The one who is lowering his head is Shiki.</p><br/><p>Actually, tomorrow is lecture day in the Academy.</p><br/><p>At evening, I was planning on going to Rotsgard in order to have a preparatory meeting, so meeting with Shiki today was within schedule.</p><br/><p>I simply didn\u2019t expect it to turn into meeting in the morning.</p><br/><p>Because of the sudden call of Shiki, I am currently at Kaleneon, a place I haven\u2019t been to for a while.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so, how\u2019s Jin?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cHe has regained consciousness, but he is still in a state of extreme agitation. I didn\u2019t expect Jin to lose control in such a manner. It was my blunder.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026He is still alive. You don\u2019t have to be bothered so much by it, Shiki. You must have estimated the amount he could handle when you had him train after all.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right.</p><br/><p>Apparently, Shiki was training Jin, who was burning with desire to be employed by us, in a separate curriculum from that of the classes and had him take some work to see.</p><br/><p>Of course, he wasn\u2019t alone. The company staff was also with him.</p><br/><p>The training itself was just as I said, not something that was too dangerous.</p><br/><p>Regarding Jin, Amelia, and the students, I have given a relative amount of material for Shiki and have left it to him, and from what I have heard, there\u2019s no problems.</p><br/><p>By nature, it was a situation where there\u2019s no need to call for me.</p><br/><p>\u2018I am truly sorry, Jin has been seriously wounded. Please come to Kaleneon posthaste\u2019, is the report I received in my sleep, and so, that\u2019s why I am currently in Kaleneon.</p><br/><p>From what Shiki has said, the treatment has been safely done and has shown the best results where no scars are left.</p><br/><p>However, because Jin was about to die -not in a class, but in actual combat- he fell into a state of agitation.</p><br/><p>\u2026Well, at the classes, no matter how much they are conscious of death, lately, they have seriously understood somewhere in their minds that they won\u2019t die.</p><br/><p>Even if we corner them right at the borders of death, we wouldn\u2019t go as far as actually killing them after all.</p><br/><p>But actual combat is different.</p><br/><p>For the sake of stealing, protecting, eating; they will fight the enemy and kill it.</p><br/><p>Of course, only one side will survive and the other will die.</p><br/><p>In other words, Jin has experienced the fear of actual borderline death that he has not experienced in a while, and his state of mind is currently unstable.</p><br/><p>In terms of strength, he has plenty enough to work as an adventurer, but -fufufu- looks like he has finally stepped into the starting line of becoming a warrior in the real sense of the word.</p><br/><p>He probably remembered the time with the lesser dragon and that has made him even more mortified and agitated.</p><br/><p>That was also actual combat, but he was in a party, moreover, they had countermeasures before fighting, and they also had tenacity that surpassed their fear.</p><br/><p>Now then\u2026why was Jin on the verge of dying this time?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Actually, I am expecting Jin to act in Kaleneon\u2019s matters. And so, I was thinking about having him experience fighting in a snow country and the way to fight there, so I brought him here with the intentions of having him learn in actual practice.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd there was an unexpected factor that even Shiki was unable to predict. Is that how it is?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>Shiki\u2019s bitter smile was heavy.</p><br/><p>Maybe he thinks he has planted a trauma in his student.</p><br/><p>Being honest here, I don\u2019t feel like Shiki needs to feel so responsible about it.</p><br/><p>I also have no intentions of blaming him at all for the injury of Jin.</p><br/><p>After this, I plan on saying this to Jin when he gets somewhat better: \u2018Don\u2019t make Shiki worry\u2019, \u2018are you a weakling?\u2019, \u2018are your limbs decorations?\u2019, which is just some light abuse.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know for what sake he did it, but he came to our place seeking strength, and said he desired to be employed in the Kuzunoha Company.</p><br/><p>He should have known of its danger.</p><br/><p>He himself has taken the lessons and has been watching us, so he should have known that there\u2019s no way he would obtain power and money by sipping tea while watching the sunset.</p><br/><p>If that wasn\u2019t the case, he would have dropped out of class.</p><br/><p>On top of that, he was suggested training by Shiki and he accepted it, and splendidly failed in it.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, he failed expectations.</p><br/><p>At the very least, that how I have to think as the representative of the company.</p><br/><p>Everyone from Asora is also going outside and doing their best as part of the company with pride, so the responsibility is heavier.</p><br/><p>If it were simply about the class, it would be another story, but when it is about Jin and Amelia, I must make sure to act the part.</p><br/><p>\u201cShiki, in this time\u2019s matter, Jin betrayed your expectations and you were disappointed. That\u2019s all there\u2019s to it.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I\u2014! Am in part their teacher as well.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cAt the same time -for now, at least- you are the company superior of those two. Right?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026yes, it is exactly as you say, but\u2026\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, let\u2019s go with expecting the same as everyone at Asora in terms of work. Without the partiality that they are students. You are focusing too much on it.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cAm I\u2026really focusing too much on it? I admit that because he is under my tutelage and inexperienced, I have been soft.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how I see it. No matter if he is a student under your tutelage, as long as he wants to work in the Kuzunoha Company, inexperience doesn\u2019t matter. If we are going to hire them, it would be troublesome if they don\u2019t properly show the strength we seek from them.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Right. It is just as you say. If we are soft with only them, it wouldn\u2019t be a good example for the people of Asora that have crossed the gate and working hard at the outside for the company. You are completely right.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cI am leagues away from preaching Shiki though. Hahaha.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not true. This is not good, I just end up treating them as students rather than acting as a superior. If they are going to be involved with the company, I have to properly do things.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s the way to go. Now then, Jin should have calmed down by now. Maybe I should go with the: \u2018hey, wimp\u2019. And so, why did Jin end up that way?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>The mysterious factor that overturned the expectation of Shiki.</p><br/><p>It interests me.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s probably me~!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUwa?!\u201d</p><br/><p>From the other side of the room\u2019s door, a response suddenly came in place of a knock.</p><br/><p>What?!</p><br/><p>Who?!</p><br/><p>No, this voice\u2026</p><br/><p>I have heard it before?!</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it okay to enter?!\u201d</p><br/><p>An energetic voice resonates in the room.</p><br/><p>Obviously, I look at Shiki.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s probably no mistake. Because of that person\u2019s influence, Jin chased the mamonos too far and received an injury.\u201d (Shiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh~.\u201d</p><br/><p>I see.</p><br/><p>It is a voice I have heard before, but\u2026at the same time, there\u2019s a sense of discomfort for remembering.</p><br/><p>It is as if something is out of place. A strange sensation.</p><br/><p>Who is it?</p><br/><p>Well, for now, it seems like the other side doesn\u2019t hold any hostility, so let\u2019s have it enter.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease, go ahead.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse my intrusion!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Energetic.</p><br/><p>At any rate, it seems to be an energetic person.</p><br/><p>I could tell before that person came in but, she is a girl.</p><br/><p>She is in her teens and\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Around the same age as Jin and the others\u2026</p><br/><p>But\u2026</p><br/><p>Hah?!</p><br/><p>Haaaaaah?!!!</p><br/><p>\u201cNice to meet you! It is an honor to make your acquaintance, Raidou-sama! At the orders of my father, Falz, I am on duty at the Adventurer Guild of Kaleneon, my name\u2019s Sofia!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Short blue hair, both eyes not showing a single irregularity, and her energy is the same as before entering the room.</p><br/><p>The dragon slayer that Root supposedly dealt the finishing blow to\u2026has, for some reason, rejuvenated, and is standing in front of me.</p><br/><p>\u2026Father?</p><br/><p>Father, you say?!</p><br/><p>****</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s how it is. Because of me, it seems I made the apprentice-san there get injured. I am sorry.\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The young Sofia explained the situation for me, and lowered her head deeply \u2014at me.</p><br/><p>With no stiffness and no uneasiness showing.</p><br/><p>No, that\u2019s not on that level. This is\u2026yeah, she clearly doesn\u2019t know me.</p><br/><p>It looks like she really doesn\u2019t know.</p><br/><p>For some reason, she seems to be incredibly interested in me and that part is eerie, but there\u2019s not a single trace of her faking.</p><br/><p>Sofia.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know everything that happened in her past.</p><br/><p>But\u2026if -and only IF-she didn\u2019t have the objective of devouring Superior Dragons to be on the same level as Root, and didn\u2019t have any sort of factor that distorted her into darkness as she grew up, she might have ended up being a woman like this.</p><br/><p>Of course, that\u2019s only an if.</p><br/><p>But the young Sofia in front of me isn\u2019t some sort of residual spirit of her or an undead, she has clear presence. Moreover, she is calling that Root as father.</p><br/><p>\u2026No, it wasn\u2019t Root.</p><br/><p>Falz.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s how she called him.</p><br/><p>\u201cRaidou-sama?\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, right. I understand. It is nothing you should apologize for. It just means that our Jin is inexperienced.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cInexperienced?! It is true that he is a bit of a weird guy, but his skills were quite high. Ah! Could it be that in the Kuzunoha Company, even that is considered inexperienced?!\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>The young Sofia talks to me with glittering eyes.</p><br/><p>A bit of a weird guy. It is not like Jin is a weird guy.</p><br/><p>But from what I hear of young Sofia, he is indeed weird.</p><br/><p>I have also confirmed with Shiki, and it seems like what she says is true.</p><br/><p>Sister Miranda, huh.</p><br/><p>It seems like that\u2019s what Jin shouted when he coincidentally met Sofia in the middle of his training and ran to her.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t on the level of resembling an acquaintance, he was completely sure that this young Sofia was this person called Miranda.</p><br/><p>Hm\u2026</p><br/><p>Doesn\u2019t sound like he went crazy from the cold.</p><br/><p>In the first place, the current Sofia is clearly strange.</p><br/><p>She is younger, doesn\u2019t remember me, and her impression of the Kuzunoha Company is overwhelmingly good.</p><br/><p>And that girl looks similar to someone else?</p><br/><p>No good, I don\u2019t understand.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say he is skilled when he ended up injured just because his strength was not fitting for the place. It is true that if I am asked whether Jin is weak or strong in the Kuzunoha Company, I would say that he is an apprentice. He is still weak.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cUwaa~~! As expected of the world\u2019s strongest war potential, the Kuzunoha Company! You are exactly how father said!!\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>As I thought, even here she mentions Root.</p><br/><p>Geez.</p><br/><p>This Sofia being here, or more like, everything about this is a scheme of his.</p><br/><p>Going through the trouble of leaving this girl in Kaleneon, must mean that he was looking forward to me finding her and be taken aback by it.</p><br/><p>And also, he expects me to go flying to his place asking for the circumstances of this.</p><br/><p>\u2026That\u2019s exactly what I will be doing though.</p><br/><p>That irritates me.</p><br/><p>In the first place, what\u2019s that about being the world\u2019s strongest war potential.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s not an evaluation you give to a company.</p><br/><p>\u201cWar potential, is it. Seriously, how ill-natured of Falz-dono.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! My father always says this frequently. That being able to cooperate with the Kuzunoha Company is a big benefit for the Adventurer Guild. He said that Raidou-sama is an important and irreplaceable existence.\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cT-That\u2019s why he said that you are his \u2018most trusted person\u2019 and send me to Kaleneon. I was looking forward to the day I meet you like this. That\u2019s the truth.\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>\u2026Sofia.</p><br/><p>She looks happy.</p><br/><p>Yeah, there\u2019s no doubt about that.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no doubt in her words.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s start over. I will give her the chance.</p><br/><p>It is certainly great.</p><br/><p>But\u2026that innocence, that pure way of her bringing the conversation to me, looking at her who is happy about this moving meeting of hers\u2026for some reason, it was painful for me.</p><br/><p>I still don\u2019t understand the reason why.</p><br/><p>The figure of Sofia enjoying life\u2026looked pitiful.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know how, but Root has given her a life opposite of hatred, a life of happiness.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s how it is, and yet\u2026</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t read the emotions of Shiki who is standing at my side.</p><br/><p>He is simply showing a gentle expression as a superior of the company and at times, gesturing comprehension to the words of Sofia.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, he told me to keep this a secret, but I can\u2019t lie to father and Raidou-sama, so I am telling you this, okay?\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><br/><p>The young Sofia made a troubled expression and then soon returned to the smile she showed until now as she said this.</p><br/><p>Shiki\u2019s eyebrow moves slightly.</p><br/><p>\u2026New information huh.</p><br/><p>That \u2018he\u2019 she mentioned just now, is she referring to the person that rescued Jin at the base of the snow mountain?</p><br/><p>That\u2019s what Sofia said.</p><br/><p>That there was a man who wiped out the mamonos that cornered Jin.</p><br/><p>It is questionable for a person that\u2019s challenging the snow mountain, but apparently, it was a knight-looking person that sported a full plate armor. Moreover, he was riding a strong horse.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s so many things to retort to that I don\u2019t even know where to begin.</p><br/><p>Being told this is some new sort of illusion magic would be more believable.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe introduced himself as Aznoval. It seems like he saved the apprentice there, and when I arrived at the place, he said: \u2018I am Aznoval\u2026is the alias I go by as a knight -no I mean, an adventurer of ori\u2013 no, not that either, I am just passing by. By the way, where\u2019s Tsige?\u2019\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>Aznoval?</p><br/><p>I know that name though.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom the looks of it, I don\u2019t think it was an alias but his real name. He was wandering Kaleneon, and was asking the directions for Tsige. That\u2019s clearly weird.\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>\u2026That\u2019s true. It is way too far.</p><br/><p>It is like being in China, and asking the way to Finland.</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s from Silk Road to Middle East, that\u2019s barely realistic.</p><br/><p>Even if this world has teleport formations, the standard way of transportation in this world is at the level of the Middle Ages.</p><br/><p>Anyways, Tsige huh.</p><br/><p>If he is from the Adventurers of Origin, I can\u2019t ignore that the name Tsige came out from his mouth.</p><br/><p>First of all, let\u2019s look at the state of Jin, and then, return to Tsige.</p><br/><p>\u2026I will leave the labyrinth exploration for the afternoon, and in that time, I will have everyone investigate about the things related to Iroha-chan.</p><br/><p>Now that I think about it, Mio wanted to inspect the miso production.</p><br/><p>It is dull but, as a small reward, let\u2019s make it free time this morning with the pretext of investigation.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt any rate, what should we do about that boy? I am not Miranda-san, and am not that boy\u2019s sister though. Today is our first time meeting. If this were a new type of flirting, I would have been able to reject it\u2026\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>\u201cI will be asking him that after this, so it may take a bit of time, but if you are okay with it\u2026\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Raidou-sama says so. Also, please don\u2019t use formal speech with someone like me. It seems like you are busy today, but it would make me happy if you were to lend me your time in the near future! Well then, I would feel bad taking so much of your time, so I will be leaving now!\u201d (Sofia)</p><br/><p>She doesn\u2019t intend to meet Jin, huh.</p><br/><p>But that\u2019s true.</p><br/><p>It would make me feel more at ease if this were simply Jin fallin\u2019 in love at first sight with Sofia and him trying some nonsensical flirting.</p><br/><p>Now then, let\u2019s hurry.</p><br/><p>I have to finish the business here and in Tsige while it is morning, and return to Kannaoi by the afternoon.</p><br/><p>Tsige huh. It would be nice if there\u2019s someone who knows about the objective of this Aznoval person though.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

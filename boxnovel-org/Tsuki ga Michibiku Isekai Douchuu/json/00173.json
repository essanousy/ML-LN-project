Maybe I should be happy with that\u2026 But I\u2019m not.</p><br/><p>If I\u2019m not mistaken, Shiki will be at Asora for the whole day today.</p><br/><p>Which means there\u2019s no chance that he\u2019ll meet Senpai.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s see, the people that Senpai and I are commonly acquainted with would be Limia\u2019s king and Prince Joshua.</p><br/><p>So it\u2019s safer to assume that those two have talked to Senpai about me while referring to me as Raidou.</p><br/><p>But Senpai is aware that I\u2019m Misumi Makoto, so she shouldn\u2019t know that I\u2019m Raidou.</p><br/><p>So should I introduce myself as Raidou now or would it be better to conceal that I\u2019m Raidou?</p><br/><p>If I introduce myself as Raidou, she\u2019ll know that Raidou is the leader of the Kuzunoha company. Senpai definitely came here knowing that the Kuzunoha company is here, right?</p><br/><p>Which means that even if I hide it now, I get the feeling that fact will be revealed sooner or later.</p><br/><p>Wait. Is it a problem if Senpai knows that I\u2019m Raidou?</p><br/><p>When I went to Limia, I didn\u2019t call myself Raidou, I think.</p><br/><p>So if I don\u2019t introduce myself as Raidou here, I guess the chances of it being revealed in the near future are pretty high?</p><br/><p>In that case, it\u2019s better to tell the truth?</p><br/><p>I could just explain that I\u2019m using this false name because there\u2019s someone (a goddess) that I don\u2019t want my movements to be noticed by.</p><br/><p>And I get the feeling that even if I try to lie here, Senpai will pick up on my suspicious behavior anyway.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Okay, let\u2019s introduce myself as Raidou.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s easier, and better for the future as well.</p><br/><p>The inside of my head is quite chaotic as I think about various things, but I somehow manage to come to a decision.</p><br/><p>\u300cMisumi-kun?\u300d(Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Senpai calls out to me, since I\u2019ve frozen in place.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, Senpai, actually...\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>As Senpai gives me a puzzled look, I explain that I\u2019m going by the name of Raidou now.</p><br/><p>For some reason, Senpai looks extremely shocked upon learning that I\u2019m Raidou.</p><br/><p>The king and the prince.</p><br/><p>Just what have you been telling Senpai about me!</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, you\u2019re Raidou? That\u2019s the same name as the head of the Kuzunoha company, isn\u2019t it?\u300d(Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u300cY-yes. I\u2019m acting as the leader for the Kuzunoha company. Though I\u2019m being helped a lot by the people around me.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cMisumi-kun is... Raidou... Wait a moment, that\u2019s important too, but isn\u2019t there a more important detail?!\u300d(Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u300cEh?\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cAre you a hero, too? I heard from the goddess that there are two heroes in this world. The fact that you\u2019re here means that you\u2019re a third one, right?\u300d(Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u300cAh... No, my circumstances are a little different from you Senpais. What the goddess told you is correct. There are two heroes, because I\u2019m not a hero.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cBut you were summoned here, right? By her.\u300d(Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, yes. Ah, I\u2019m sorry. First, I\u2019ll lead the way to our Kuzunoha company.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>It seems Senpai had some business with our company from the beginning.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s better to go there rather than stand around outside and talk like this.</p><br/><p>\u300cTo the Kuzunoha company? Hmm... I guess so. Well then, I\u2019ll impose on you for a little while.\u300d(Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, please feel free. \u201cFor a little while\u201d, does that mean that you have other important matters to attend to, Senpai?\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>She was supposed to be heading to Lorel, so I doubt she\u2019s particularly free.</p><br/><p>Anyhow, I\u2019ll try asking her about that.</p><br/><p>It looks like our conversation will consist entirely of asking each other questions, but I\u2019m kind of looking forward to it.</p><br/><p>She was supposed to have some companions with her, but right now she\u2019s alone.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s strange that she\u2019s carrying her sword that\u2019s supposed to be her weapon on her back, wrapped in cloth.</p><br/><p>Since it\u2019s unusual to see people walking around armed in this academy city.</p><br/><p>Senpai is a hero, so I\u2019d assume that she\u2019s staying at a high-class inn where she wouldn\u2019t have to worry about her weapon being stolen. If she left it with them, it\u2019d be easier to walk around.</p><br/><p>It\u2019d be safer to carry it if she were planning to go to the more dangerous areas of the city, but then I don\u2019t understand why she wouldn\u2019t have her companions with her.</p><br/><p>For now, as I\u2019m deep in thought about various things, I erase the memory of Senpai\u2019s extreme clothing as well as my state upon seeing that from my head.</p><br/><p>Because of that, I don\u2019t say much during the short time that I\u2019m leading Senpai along.</p><br/><p>As if she\u2019s thinking about something herself, she simply follows my lead silently.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u300cAnd then, I was told that the Kuzunoha company has skilled dwarves.\u300d(Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u300cSo your business with us is that you need your sword repaired. But Senpai, even with our craftsmen, I think it\u2019s impossible for it to be finished today.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>As I listen to Senpai in the company\u2019s drawing room, she explains why she came to academy city in such a hurry.</p><br/><p>We also touched on the battle that happened in the royal capital city of Limia, but she hasn\u2019t made the connection between the names Shiki or Larva and us. That makes me truly relieved.</p><br/><p>The reason she\u2019s stopped by in Rotsgard, which isn\u2019t directly on the way to Lorel from Limia, is the craftsmen of the Kuzunoha company.</p><br/><p>The people of Limia know quite a lot about us, huh.</p><br/><p>Either that, or they sent Otonashi-senpai here to make a request for us to work together with the Kingdom of Limia.</p><br/><p>Even when she was in Japan, she was the kind of person who could lead others.</p><br/><p>Of course, that\u2019s still the case now.</p><br/><p>She\u2019s still the same senpai I admired from afar in Japan.</p><br/><p>\u300cI didn\u2019t expect that my weapon could be repaired in a day. I\u2019m going to be staying here for another week, so as long as it\u2019s finished by then, there won\u2019t be any problems. It\u2019d be easy if Beren-san were here, is he currently present?\u300d(Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Beren?</p><br/><p>Why is Beren\u2019s name being mentioned here?</p><br/><p>\u300cBeren, you say? He\u2019s working in our first store in Tsige. Are you acquainted with him?\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cThat sword, I had it made for me by Beren-san. Though it looks a bit different to when I first got it from him.\u300d(Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Beren made a weapon for Senpai?</p><br/><p>A strange relationship has been built without me knowing.</p><br/><p>She said she was in Tsige for about a month, so did it happen then?</p><br/><p>I\u2019m grateful that she chose us out of all the stores that are available, but if Senpai and her party have been polishing their skills in the wastelands, it\u2019s amazing that we haven\u2019t met sooner.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s lucky or unlucky.</p><br/><p>Anyway, she wasn\u2019t given some pre-made product; it\u2019s a weapon that was created for her to use.</p><br/><p>To think that their relationship is such that she remembers his name properly.</p><br/><p>I ignored it back then, so I\u2019ll confirm it properly now.</p><br/><p>\u300cPlease wait a moment. The craftsman who works here will come soon.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s a weapon that Beren made, there\u2019ll be no problem with leaving it here.</p><br/><p>I can just show it to him in Asora tonight or something.</p><br/><p>If he has a whole week, I\u2019m sure Beren can repair a weapon that he made himself.</p><br/><p>\u300cDid you call, Waka-sama?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cFufu~\u300d(Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Senpai is laughing, as if she finds something funny.</p><br/><p>When I was greeted by a loud\u300cWelcome back, Waka-sama!\u300das we returned she was dumbfounded, but it seems she finds it amusing now.</p><br/><p>She\u2019s reacting like this every time she hears someone call me \u201cWaka-sama\u201d.</p><br/><p>I take the sword that\u2019s wrapped in cloth from Senpai and hand it to the Eldwa that\u2019s come over.</p><br/><p>Senpai really is pretty.</p><br/><p>Even in this world, she\u2019s considered a beautiful woman.</p><br/><p>Given that, the other hero is probably attractive as well.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m kind of looking forward to meeting him, but it\u2019ll also be a pain.</p><br/><p>\u300cI want this sword fixed. Confirm whether you can do it or not.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>I make this request to the craftsman as the leader of the company.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ve been told that it\u2019s not good to be overly friendly.</p><br/><p>Especially when it comes to demi-humans, even if only in appearance, I should be pulling their strings properly.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s what Rembrandt-san and Zara-san told me so I just assume they\u2019re correct and put it into practice, but it still feels uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>\u300cAt once. Well then, I shall examine it now.\u300d(Eldwa)</p><br/><p>\u300cPlease do.\u300d(Hibiki)</p><br/><p>A serious expression returns to Senpai\u2019s face as she stares at the Eldwa holding the now-exposed sword and bows from her seated position.</p><br/><p>She\u2019s even more polite than when she\u2019s talking to me...</p><br/><p>I-I suppose she\u2019s Japanese after all; it\u2019s important to respect craftsmen, yes.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt pains me to say this, but it seems that this has been put to use in unreasonable situations. I will work under the assumption that it has seen some fierce battles.\u300d(Eldwa)</p><br/><p>\u300c... Yes. It has saved my life many times.\u300d(Hibiki)</p><br/><p>The craftsman continues to examine the sword carefully and thoroughly.</p><br/><p>I look towards him. He\u2019s noticed, so I talk to him through thought transmission.</p><br/><p>[She said it\u2019s one of Beren\u2019s creations. It\u2019s fine if we take it back to Asora to show it to him there, so can you just accept it for now?] (Makoto)</p><br/><p>[This was Beren-dono\u2019s creation? I am still inexperienced, to not have noticed right away.] (Eldwa)</p><br/><p>[Please.] (Makoto)</p><br/><p>[I will do as you say.] (Eldwa)</p><br/><p>\u300cOtonashi-sama, did you say your name was?\u300d(Eldwa)</p><br/><p>\u300cYes. How is it? Could it be repaired so that I can swing it as I originally did?\u300d(Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u300cThere will be no problem. Now that I look closely, it is the creation of one of my colleagues. I believe sufficient work can be done on it if we are just given three days.\u300d(Eldwa)</p><br/><p>\u300cReally! Then can I leave it to you?\u300d(Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u300cThat is not for the likes of me to decide. I can make my own judgments, but not choose whether to accept your request.\u300d(Eldwa)</p><br/><p>The Eldwa quickly glances at me.</p><br/><p>I said it\u2019s fine.</p><br/><p>We don\u2019t need to put on these little acts now.</p><br/><p>\u300cOf course, we will accept your request. It is a request from none other than my senpai. A fellow Japanese person that I\u2019ve encountered in this other world.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cThanks, Misumi-kun.\u300d(Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u300cNot at all. You may leave, and make sure to handle it with care.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cPlease leave it to me. Well then, Otonashi-sama, I will take care of your weapon.\u300d(Eldwa)</p><br/><p>Still holding the sword, the Eldwa bows his head low and exits the room. As I watch him leave, I exhale lightly and sink deeply into the sofa.</p><br/><p>\u300cAs I thought, it was hard for you to maintain that attitude.\u300d(Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ve been taught that when conducting myself as the head of a company, that kind of thing is necessary. You understand, after all?\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cI do. You were the kind of person who couldn\u2019t even take that sort of attitude with the kouhais in the club, weren\u2019t you?\u300d(Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u300cYou are quite knowledgeable. I didn\u2019t think you would even remember me.\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>I was never the type to stand out.</p><br/><p>\u300cThat might be true for you, Misumi-kun. But the archery club itself stood out a lot. By surviving in that club long enough to become its vice-president, you attracted a certain amount of interest. Ah, weren\u2019t you called a hero by some people in Nakakou*?\u300d(Hibiki)</p><br/><p>TLN*: This is a contraction of the name of their high school, \u201c/Nakatsuhara Koukou\u201d.</p><br/><p>\u300c... Please don\u2019t make me remember such strange things. Even if I\u2019m not really good-looking, is it so strange for me to be in the archery club because I like bows?\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>I stayed in the archery club for over a year, even though I\u2019m not really attractive. Because of that, I had this nickname that I wanted to get rid of.</p><br/><p>Of course, there were a lot of people who joined the club with their eyes set on the good-looking members, so the first years were put through some tough training as soon as they joined.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s how they filtered those people out.</p><br/><p>With that, quite a lot of the ones that were only in it for the attractive people and had no interest in archery left. Selections were confirmed around fall each year, and the training became less harsh.</p><br/><p>The fact that those attractive people survived through that could be called one of the seven wonders of the world.</p><br/><p>I think that calling someone a hero just because they survive longer than a year is questionable, though.</p><br/><p>Before I realize it, I\u2019ve been reminiscing about the club and high school for the first time in a while.</p><br/><p>\u300cOf course. Hmm, I would definitely like to hear the story of how you came to this world in detail, but...\u300d(Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u300cBut?\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m suddenly feeling quite nostalgic now. I can\u2019t talk about these things to anyone else, so shall we talk about Japan some more?\u300d(Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u300cEh?!\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>Is that okay?</p><br/><p>Talking about Japan would be much more enjoyable for me than being questioned about how I came to this world, so for that I\u2019m grateful.</p><br/><p>But this is that Otonashi Hibiki-senpai.</p><br/><p>She\u2019s flawless in both her knowledge and her fighting skills.</p><br/><p>The rumors I hear about her as a hero are nothing short of outstanding.</p><br/><p>Is she the kind of person who would have these types of meaningless, reminiscing conversations?</p><br/><p>No, I don\u2019t think so.</p><br/><p>\u300cOh yeah, this is something that happened quite a while before I came here, but there was an incident where the president of the archery club and a first-year girl who was rumored to be cute both got mad, right? I\u2019m sure you remember it, since you were in the same club.\u300d(Hibiki)</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>I remember it clearly!</p><br/><p>Wait, we\u2019re starting on a topic that I can\u2019t discuss?!</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t you know something about that, since you were the vice-president? I\u2019m sure there were things that you couldn\u2019t say while you were back there, but now that we\u2019re here, there\u2019s some kind of physical statute of limitations so you can say them now, right?\u300d(Hibiki)</p><br/><p>What the hell do you mean by physical statute of limitations!</p><br/><p>\u300cT-that\u2019s...\u300d(Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ve done everything that I needed to for today. They were all personal matters that I needed to take care of anyway, so I\u2019ve been moving around separately from everyone else. I\u2019ve sorted out the matter regarding my sword, as well. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be good for both of us to think about our memories in Japan.\u300d(Hibiki)</p><br/><p>When Senpai smiles, she really is beautiful.</p><br/><p>I somehow remember our social statuses back on earth, and am pressured into simply nodding by the power of her smile.</p><br/><p>With this relationship between senpai and kouhai, I get the feeling that I\u2019m not allowed to agree or disagree. At least for me, who was part of a sports-related club.</p><br/><p>Well, I don\u2019t have to be so cautious when talking about Japan.</p><br/><p>The goddess, or Larva.</p><br/><p>If I distract her from mentioning those topics, maybe I can settle things by just having a silly, enjoyable conversation between two people from the same town.</p><br/><p>My conversation with Senpai, who is both a good speaker and a good listener, is far livelier than I could\u2019ve imagined.</p><br/><p>We sit in the drawing room and have a long, pleasant conversation as we remember our hometown.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Hibiki and the others notice that they have arrived to their objective.</p><br/><p>They are at Tsige which is showing the most growth in this remote region, and moreover, in the Rembrandt Company that is riding on the momentum and growing with it. They are at a corner.</p><br/><p>A darkish skin demi-human smiled at them gently from the counter and received them.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s the sub-branch of Kuzunoha Company in Tsige.</p><br/><p>This company has already obtained a deep amount of stable customers and among the adventurers it is a store they admire.</p><br/><p>It uses outstanding materials and in this town it is the place with the highest quality of equipment. Moreover, if one has the right amount of money, they even accept orders for improvements or original weapon creations. For equipment that will certainly last for a long time, not only the adventurers but the people who have occupations where they will encounter battles, rate this place highly.</p><br/><p>Even so, there are a number of merchants at a corner lining up to buy medicine. Kuzunoha Company\u2019s medications are famous for being more effective than those other unskillful magic medications and their sales are rising. There\u2019s no doubt that it is doing well as a company.</p><br/><p>Right now the armor orders are temporarily stopped, so in the place for armor orders, there\u2019s no one. However, a number of adventurer-looking hyumans were there looking at the situation from the distance, so some people were anticipating that the orders will begin again.</p><br/><p>Hibiki and her companions were transported to an inn in Tsige by Mio while they were unconscious. Mio gave detailed instructions to the landlady and left the inn. Hibiki\u2019s group heard the situation from the landlady (several parts were altered) and devoted themselves to Bredda who was heavily injured, living several days there.</p><br/><p>And so, today.</p><br/><p>Because Bredda was able to walk normally now, they once again reunited and headed to Kuzunoha Company\u2019s sub-branch where they were told they could contact Mio.</p><br/><p>Hibiki\u2019s group didn\u2019t know about the gazes of inquisitiveness and envy that were being directed at them. It\u2019s because they were envious of them having connections with Mio, but Hibiki\u2019s group who don\u2019t know about Kuzunoha Company and the status of Mio in this town, it is no surprise that they haven\u2019t noticed.</p><br/><p>When the Forest Oni clerk said \u201cSorry for making you wait\u201d, a black haired girl they met a few days ago appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat knight, it seems he has healed already-desu ne. It\u2019s great that it was nothing serious\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah\u2026 That time you really aided us. From what I heard, you even lend a hand in healing. We thank you\u201d (Bredda)</p><br/><p>Bredda himself steps forward and thanks Mio. Mio glances at him and soon turns her gaze to Hibiki.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind-desu wa. I am used to protecting after all. And so Hibiki, it seems that your companion is in a good state but, do you have time?\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I heard from the landlady that you had business with me. So uhm\u2026 Is it about the fight with the mamono?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Hibiki\u2019s expression is gloomy. Showing a pathetic appearance and being told that she was disappointed, had become a lingering discomfort inside her. For her, there were no past experiences where she has disappointed anyone and no experience in confronting her own weakness.</p><br/><p>Coupled with the fight of the demon general that made her hold doubts about her strength, she who is a hero, hadn\u2019t been able to digest this feeling inside her yet.</p><br/><p>\u201cFight? Ah, I don\u2019t really mind that. I just said this but, because of reasons, I am used to protecting people like you. Just think of it as being lucky-desu wa\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>However, Mio\u2019s words totally negated Hibiki\u2019s thoughts. From Mio\u2019s point of view, the way back to Tsige had turned into protecting hyumans, that\u2019s all.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe were lucky\u2026?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, because you guys didn\u2019t die. Moreover, I am not your companion nor your teacher and yet, why do I have to grade your fight and scold you?\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Mio\u2019s words implied that she didn\u2019t care much about the life of Hibiki\u2019s group. Those words stabbed Hibiki\u2019s group.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is\u2026 then why did you save us?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cI told this to the landlady too but, Hibiki, it\u2019s because I had business with you-desu. I still haven\u2019t asked you about how to make Dashi from the marine products and dried fish after all\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cD-Dashi is it?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cJust because of that?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c? That\u2019s right. If you know about ways to cook, it would be a pity to have you die. Just that. Now Hibiki, you have already taken care of your worries, so please give me some of your time\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Without any concern, Mio just answers the words of the dazed Hibiki.</p><br/><p>\u201cMio-dono, we are grateful for saving us, but we are unable to agree to your request. The reason we came here is to train and get good equipment. Sadly, we don\u2019t have time to spare\u2026\u201d (Wudi)</p><br/><p>Wudi opposes Mio\u2019s proposal. Hibiki\u2019s group came to Tsige because they were looking for an outstanding place to train. And also to find equipment that matches their skills. For the sake of the rematch with the demon general and also to overcome Stella Fort this time for certain. All of these actions are for that sake.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop it. To be defeated by an enemy of that level and moreover for a party that has the decision making of a baby, stepping into the wasteland will just turn you into feed. Your levels may be high, but in that place that just makes you a child with big build. It\u2019s impossible-desu\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Mio rejects Wudi\u2019s speech as if amazed. It wasn\u2019t that she belittled them or scorned them. It was like she was really admonishing a kid.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven so! We have to get stronger! We don\u2019t have the time!\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Mio sighs at Hibiki\u2019s intense words. Because she saw in her eyes the light of an adventurer hurrying to its death place, the characteristic eyes of a person with narrowed vision.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand. I thought you were adventurers who were a bit different, but do you have an objective that makes you hurry that much?\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I want you to at least repay me for saving your life? Also, no matter how strong you are, do you intent to take such a small child to the wasteland?\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSilent-desu ka. To think you guys were more stupid than I thought. Hmph, even so, this is troubling. I also can\u2019t back off after all\u2026\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cMio-san, for a while we will be moving in the day. So how about I tag along with Mio-san at night?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom how you said it, it feels like there might not even be that many days-desu wa ne. I see, what should I do\u2026?\u201d (Mio) </p><br/><p>Hibiki and Mio converse across the counter.</p><br/><p>There, one man cuts in. It\u2019s a man that just like Mio, came from the interior of the store.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, how about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cN, Beren. Do you have an ingenious idea?\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not to the point of calling it ingenious though. Mio-sama wants to ask about cooking to that lady there right? And if possible, learn the techniques as well\u201d (Beren)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so, the group says they want to get stronger at the wasteland\u201d (Beren)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. That\u2019s the reason why we came\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Aside from Hibiki who answered, the others also assent.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see, just like how Mio-sama said, if it continues like this, you guys will die in given time. Practically certain\u201d (Beren)</p><br/><p>\u201c!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBeren, don\u2019t beat around the bush and just say it!\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry for the discourtesy. If you are going to teach Mio-sama cooking, in regards of teaching her, I will also provide everyone with equipment that fits you in deferred payment. You can leave to the wasteland at that time. That way, until the equipment is done\u2026 let\u2019s see, three days maybe. In that time it will be done. After that, you will continue teaching Mio-sama cooking at night. What do you think? Excuse me for my impoliteness, it is true that everyone\u2019s equipment is reasonably good, but they seem to be quite damaged. To go to the wasteland like that is suicide\u201d (Beren)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Can we be at peace by just changing the equipment?\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, how about having Toa and the others accompany them as well? If it\u2019s Mio-sama\u2019s request, they won\u2019t refuse\u201d (Beren)</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. If it\u2019s them, as long as it is in the day there\u2019s not much to worry. Beren, wasn\u2019t it an ingenious idea after all?\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cI am honored. And so, how about it?\u201d (Beren)</p><br/><p>The opinions of the people inside the counter had been arranged and the dwarf craftsman asks for the answer of Hibiki\u2019s group.</p><br/><p>\u201cThree days huh. You can\u2019t shorten that time?\u201d (Bredda) </p><br/><p>\u201cI will be taking the measurements now so. It is a different story from just repairing. Three days is an incredibly short time that no matter what craftsmen you ask would concur\u201d (Beren)</p><br/><p>To Bredda\u2019s question, the craftsman Beren answers politely. Inside him, he was amazed by the knight who didn\u2019t understand smithing.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat prove do we have that the accompanying adventurers can be trusted?\u201d (Wudi)</p><br/><p>It\u2019s the magician Wudi. He was worried whether the people accompanying can be trusted. To have the adventurers you hired betray you, isn\u2019t that unusual of a story. If a betrayal occurs in a dangerous place, it can even kill them all.</p><br/><p>\u201cToa-dono is the person at the top of Tsige\u2019s list. Her face is known and she is not the kind of person who would do unreasonable things. Her party\u2019s average level is over 450 and its ability can soon be called high class\u201d (Beren)</p><br/><p>\u201c450?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, they are adventurers Mio-sama trusts. If you say there\u2019s no way you can trust them, then at that time we would have to think of another way\u201d (Beren)</p><br/><p>\u201c?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wudi trembles at the gaze mixed with blood thirst that Beren released for a second. He felt like he wouldn\u2019t hesitate to take unscrupulous means. To feel danger from a conversation about cooking is just unreasonable.</p><br/><p>With a nod that one could take as consent, Wudi steps back.</p><br/><p>\u201cHibiki, what will you do? I do think this proposal is advantageous for your party though?\u201d (Beren)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I count on you\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat! Then let\u2019s begin the measuring as soon as possible. Beren, hurry. The first one will be Hibiki okay? After that, contact Toa and\u2026\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, over here please\u201d (Beren)</p><br/><p>Being invited by Mio and Beren, Hibiki\u2019s group disappears into the interior of the store.</p><br/><p>Limia\u2019s Hero began her restart in the borderland.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6</p><br/><p>This is the first time in Hibiki\u2019s life that several months felt so short.</p><br/><p>Now it feels nostalgic the times when they were surprised by the performance of the weapons Beren and the other elder dwarfs created.</p><br/><p>From the adventurer party of the girl Toa they were presented to, they have learned the adventurer way of decision making and way of thinking. Toa who was filling the role as party leader, is the type who uses speed as weapon and while it is the same type as Hibiki, she uses a different method to take advantage of the enemy\u2019s openings, and she was able to become a good sparring partner for Hibiki. Toa who thought of Hibiki as a person of her same trade, didn\u2019t find the chance to show Hibiki her trump card and hidden skills. No one knows what the result would be if a real fight were to happen. At least Hibiki thinks that she doesn\u2019t want to confront her.</p><br/><p>Lately, Hibiki has not been increasing her level, however, her strength has clearly increased.</p><br/><p>At first, Hibiki who was still dragging her trauma of losing her companion, splendidly lost in a spar with Toa who was close to her level. She already has experience, but this is the first time that Hibiki has lost to a hyuman so badly. By the way, she also sparred with Mio, but the result was a complete defeat. She practically didn\u2019t let her do anything.</p><br/><p>One time, late at night in the inn where she had expanded a barrier in case of intruders and was sleeping, there was a case when Mio had, not broken the barrier, but passed through it and woke her up. Hibiki who was struggling because she didn\u2019t know what was happening, got easily subjugated and was dragged to the kitchen by Mio who had sparkling eyes, to teach her cooking.</p><br/><p>There was a time when Hibiki who was particularly stuck to the idea of levels, didn\u2019t understand why she lost to Toa who has a lower level than her, and had to ask.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen I was in Zenno, I was like that. Well, aren\u2019t levels just one of many indicators?\u201d (Toa)</p><br/><p>Is what Toa thought as she remembered the masked merchant.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaving a high level is just proof that you have killed a lot. You shouldn\u2019t feel strength from a number but with your body\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>This was said by Mio. It was slightly mixed with the masochism when she was controlled by hunger, but Hibiki didn\u2019t notice it. She was only looking at Mio with admiration.</p><br/><p>And that Mio who was being taught by Hibiki the way to make Dashi from dried fish and konbu, had the sparkling eyes of a child.</p><br/><p>A companion that has the same black hair as her, and even if it\u2019s only limited to cooking, she is able to talk to her about the knowledge of her previous world in a favorable light. As Hibiki was steadily conquering her trauma, she was at the same time growing dependent of Mio.</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>Tonight will be the last night her party will be staying in Tsige.</p><br/><p>A repatriation order had been send by Limia.</p><br/><p>At first, because they were being treated favorably by the dwarfs, Hibiki\u2019s party were a target of envy, but being friends with Toa\u2019s party and the mutual cooperation in the wasteland, and at the same time as Hibiki conquered her trauma, she slowly regained her disposition of attracting spirits and were slowly being accepted by the adventurers in this remote region.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why tonight, a party was being held for the sake of her and her party, and a great number of adventurers were sad at their parting as they make a racket. There were some who decided to follow Hibiki\u2019s party to Limia and there were others who had decided to fight alongside her.</p><br/><p>Bredda and Wudi were dead drunk and in that state, they disappeared somewhere. Maybe they were kidnapped by women who were sad by their departure and wanted to pass a night of passion with them.</p><br/><p>Chiya didn\u2019t have adventurers who were the same age as her and felt left out, so she had a time when she was homesick, but because she hit it off with Toa\u2019s sister Rinon, she was having fun in this party as she drank juice and in the end, the two of them happily went to sleep on the same bed.</p><br/><p>And Hibiki\u2026</p><br/><p>Had left the tumult and was on top of the rampart that surrounds the town. It couldn\u2019t compare to the modern sight of neon, but at her back there\u2019s the lighted town of Tsige. At her front, there\u2019s the gold highway. The place where the wealthy merchant Rembrandt and his butler saw off Misumi Makoto, is exactly this place.</p><br/><p>She is not alone.</p><br/><p>From the inner part leaning at the rampart, there is a woman looking at Hibiki. It\u2019s Mio.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard you have something to talk about? Is it something that you have to ask me to come all the way here for-desu no?\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Yes. In that place where a party is being held, I just felt like the mood was not right\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Hibiki who was looking at the highway, turns around.</p><br/><p>\u201cMake it short. Being in this kind of place at midnight can create unnecessary misunderstandings\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cAs always, when it isn\u2019t related to cooking you are so cold, Mio-san. Understood, I have two things I want to convey\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, Mio-san thank you very much\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Hibiki lowers her head deeply and gives her thanks.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we didn\u2019t meet Mio at Koran, I think we wouldn\u2019t be alive. The wasteland was a lot harsher than we thought. The trigger was Horn running wild, but I am really glad that I met you Mio-san\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cI also had an objective after all. There\u2019s no need to thank me\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>(Also, the reason why that wolf called Horn attacked me was because he reacted to my smell. Through the end it seems these guys didn\u2019t realize that I am the black spider they fought, but only that thing noticed it. There\u2019s no helping it that he attacked me. Also, I have already \u201csilenced\u201d Horn, so there\u2019s no need for me to tell her) (Mio)</p><br/><p>Mio found out the reason the silver wolf attacked her. On top of that, she gave detailed instructions to Horn and had him unable to disclose anything to Hibiki and the others. Thinking about the conditions, that wolf wouldn\u2019t disclose anything, is what Mio thought with peace of mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was surprised that you even had katanas, but the sword that Beren-san made is really incredible. Our meeting with him is also thanks to Mio, so please accept my thanks\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Hibiki had her heart quite moved when she saw the katana at the elder dwarfs\u2019 workshop. It is also because she originally practiced kendo. When she took it in her hands and unsheated it, she was dazzled by that beauty and gulped her breath.</p><br/><p>But, Beren bluntly told Hibiki that she is not fit for a katana and cut off her longing eyes.</p><br/><p>Beren who had seen her sword, had warned her that Hibiki\u2019s sword technique didn\u2019t fit katanas anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can tell that the skills that lie in young lady\u2019s body are originally techniques that handle single edged swords. However, the sword that young lady is swinging right now is clearly double-edged sword techniques. I don\u2019t recommend the katana which also has a special method of maintenance. That\u2019s my opinion as a person who recommends weapons\u201d (Beren)</p><br/><p>There was no mistake.</p><br/><p>The way of using a sword that Hibiki had originally known was kendo and a bit of fencing. Apart from kendo which she continued in club activities, she also learned a bit of fencing, but because of reasons, she soon had to stop.</p><br/><p>And so, when she came to this world, she had now settled with the real combat sword techniques of the now deceased Naval that are mixed with self-taught techniques as well as the way of fighting with the bastard sword. To use a katana now might be difficult, she herself knows that.</p><br/><p>Accepting the warning obediently, Hibiki for the first time obtained a weapon that surpassed her abilities. Contrary to how it has been in the past, she had to train to be able to properly pull out the capabilities of the weapon. That sword which was mixed in with Beren\u2019s playful side, is a sword that\u2019s bigger than a bastard sword and its appearance is one that can compare to a big sword, but it was unexpectedly lighter than the sword Hibiki used.</p><br/><p>If she accurately took into consideration its size, she is able to use it just like her previous sword. That Beren used the scythe Mio showed him nonchalantly as material is one of the secrets that have not been revealed to Hibiki.</p><br/><p>Remembering that gratitude as well, Hibiki turns her gaze away from Mio and looks at the night sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think right now I am only able to bring out about half of the capabilities of this sword. Beren-san also said I still haven\u2019t been able to bring out the trick to it and was disappointed. To leave before finishing a task, is honestly mortifying\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cNot really. The current you can get proper training even without staying here. You probably will be able to use Beren\u2019s creation in a near future\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cI will do my best. And so, about the other thing I want to convey\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Hibiki, unusual from her, was showing a look like she is having a hard time choosing her words. Having drunk and eaten enough and not having any urgent business, Mio just waits silently for Hibiki\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Mio-san, could you please come together with us? In the end I wasn\u2019t able to meet him, but I will definitely make sure not to show discourtesy to the company\u2019s representative!\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>Hibiki has not met the Kuzunoha Company\u2019s representative, Raidou. It is someone that comes in conversations at times and she has also heard stories from Toa. That mysterious merchant who seems to have skill, in the end didn\u2019t return from stocking up and Hibiki and none of her companions have met him.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s just that it was clear that Mio, Beren and the people in the company admire him a lot and when they told Hibiki about Raidou, they showed extraordinary pride.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to-desu. I have Waka-sama after all. I told Hibiki too right?\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Immediate answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen together with that Waka-sama. I will also prepare it so he can make a store there\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s also a no-desu. Didn\u2019t I tell you that Waka-sama is currently busy?\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>There were no points where Hibiki could find compromise.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 This is just an example but, if my wish concerned the world and you pulling back drags Mio-san\u2019s important Waka-sama, and turns into a situation where your strength is necessary to cope with. Would you still say that?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>I am a hero, through the end, Hibiki didn\u2019t tell Mio. She deceived her by randomly telling her that her knowledge of cooking was learned from reading books. Of course, it is a lie that just by asking would soon crumble. But for Mio, the important part was the cooking knowledge and techniques and anything else was irrelevant.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s also because she was uneasy about revealing her position of hero to Toa and Mio, and changing their way of treating her. Being able to stay as a simple adventurer, this several months were fresh, and are really regretful times to part from.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot even worth discussing. I don\u2019t care about the world at all-desu. What\u2019s important is Waka-sama only. If it turns into a situation where a mere woman like me has to provide reinforcement to resolve, it means that Waka-sama can deal with it as well. Then I just need to stay at that grand person\u2019s side, and put my life for him\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 No matter what?\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter what-desu wa\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>Hibiki thought about just revealing that she is a hero once and for all, but she soon threw away that thinking. Mio said she doesn\u2019t care about the world. Then, even if she reveals that she is a hero that has been called to protect the hyuman society, it wouldn\u2019t affect the negotiation.</p><br/><p>(Just who in the world is this Waka-sama that Mio-san is so in love with? Toa-san also said that he is on a whole different level and made a wry smile after all. Could it be that guy and Mio\u2019s group could even save the world?) (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>The comment Hibiki thought jokingly might not be that much of a stupid one, is what she will think back in given time.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Fuh~. No matter what huh. I have been splendidly rejected\u201d (Hibiki)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you are a person with the role of managing a party, you must know that having it easy and being comfortable is a minus. I don\u2019t intend to follow the orders of anyone aside from Waka-sama\u201d (Mio)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes yes, thanks for all the sugar. This is all I wanted to convey.

I actually wanted to bring it out today though\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?! You are going to Lorel Union?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I have a little business there.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Hah\u2026</p><br/><p>How many times does it make it now?</p><br/><p>Just in case, I thought about telling my acquaintances in Academy town that I will be heading to Lorel Union, beginning with representative Zara, but\u2026</p><br/><p>As I reported to each one of them, I also told them that this won\u2019t be affecting my other works. But for some reason, the other people that I haven\u2019t met yet are coming to my place only knowing that \u2018I will be going to Lorel Union(going faraway)\u2019.</p><br/><p>I somehow finished my planned round of greetings and returned to my store at Rotsgard, and in there, a dizzying amount of people were intruding in the store.</p><br/><p>\u2026Among those, the office personnel of the academy was the worse.</p><br/><p>When he noticed me, he pushed his way through to where I am with a ghastly expression.</p><br/><p>And then, he suddenly fell to his knees and crawls up to my leg rather than Shiki who is at my side. He clings onto it and wailed: \u2018You liar!\u2019.</p><br/><p>In this academy town where the reconstruction is continuing and a good amount of people have returned, a happening like this occurred at broad daylight. Moreover, it is not a woman, but a man.</p><br/><p>It is a situation that only spells trouble.</p><br/><p>For a second, I thought that I went too far and a student somewhere had complained about it, but well, using the word \u2018liar\u2019 was bothering me.</p><br/><p>After calming him down, I try asking him. He said that he received information from a certain source and a third party stating that: \u2018I will be going to Lorel, so I will be absent from the academy for several months\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u2026This is just my opinion but\u2026 information from a certain source and a third party combined isn\u2019t really trustworthy.</p><br/><p>It is on the level of reading jargon from the sports section of the newspaper and jumping to your own conclusions.</p><br/><p>Also, he hasn\u2019t received any notification to cancel class from me or Shiki. In the first place, even if they received such a notification, they wouldn\u2019t have accepted it anyways, and as his stress reached astronomic levels, he felt that this would be lots of trouble so he rushed here with an expression of impending doom.</p><br/><p>Just as he said, I haven\u2019t given any notification to cancel my class, and there\u2019s no error in that either.</p><br/><p>It is true that I am going to Lorel, but that\u2019s a business that has nothing to do with the academy, so I don\u2019t plan on cancelling classes.</p><br/><p>After I explained to him that \u2018no matter what method of transportation we use, I intend to continue classes as scheduled\u2019, I had him leave.</p><br/><p>I have done the same explanation over and over again, and after I thought I finally finished with everyone, this time it was Jin.</p><br/><p>Aren\u2019t you here to work part-time?</p><br/><p>No well, I don\u2019t have experience in part-time jobs, but you know, since you are working under me, our standings should change a bit, right? I am your boss, you know?</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t that how it works?</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, uhm\u2026what about the class\u2014?!\u201d (Jin)</p><br/><p>A light *slap* sound resounded and the head of Jin lowered.</p><br/><p>\u201cJin! You are in the middle of work!\u201d (Amelia)</p><br/><p>The paper fan of Amelia hit the back of Jin\u2019s head directly and cut off his words.</p><br/><p>When I look at the paper fan she is holding, the word \u2018pain\u2019 is written on it.</p><br/><p>Ah, it is the one that hurts.</p><br/><p>I remember I was told that they made three types of paper fans: one that simply makes a loud sound but doesn\u2019t hurt; one that doesn\u2019t match the sound it makes and increases the pain; and the soundless one that hurts the most.</p><br/><p>Of course, they are joke goods.</p><br/><p>\u2026The first one, that is.</p><br/><p>Doing tsukkomis in the middle of work is questionable as well, but this is the backyard of the store anyways.</p><br/><p>The two of them are arranging the inventory here.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why it is barely acceptable.</p><br/><p>\u201c!!! Ame\u2026lia! You\u2026that\u2026hurt.\u201d (Jin)</p><br/><p>Jin was holding his head with both hands.</p><br/><p>He is so pained that his words are not coming out properly.</p><br/><p>In the words of Eris, the one that has sound and pain is still \u2018too soft\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u2026It is because she said something like that that instead of only two, a third one was created.</p><br/><p>That girl is actually pretty smart though\u2026</p><br/><p>It seems like the soundless and painful one: \u2018didn\u2019t produce blood, tears, or pain\u2019, and with those words in mind, it was created.</p><br/><p>In the first place, this was created as a punishment tool for Eris.</p><br/><p>So there\u2019s no point if it\u2019s \u2018too soft\u2019.</p><br/><p>By the way, the last version doesn\u2019t have \u2018pain\u2019 written on it, it has a skull mark.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, representative. I will continue right now.\u201d (Amelia)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo well, I did answer him as well. Let me tell you then. Jin, there\u2019s no change in the class. That\u2019s why, do your best without worrying.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cT-Thank-ssu!\u201d (Jin)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t get too poisoned by Lime\u2019s style of speaking, okay? If you are going to learn from someone, make that person Akua or someone like that. That would be safer.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Safety is best.</p><br/><p>Safety is important.</p><br/><p>This is a truth that people normally don\u2019t realize.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d (Jin)</p><br/><p>\u201cWaka~, Waka~\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEspecially the small one that\u2019s coming now, don\u2019t learn from her. Or it will be too late.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Too late is not good, definitely not good.</p><br/><p>I notice the owner of the voice that called out: \u2018Waka\u2019, and make a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>Maybe Jin and Amelia felt the same, they made a slightly troubled expression.</p><br/><p>Well, even when she is like that, she is capable and she is also their senpai.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Eris?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Waka~. To think that you are actually looking after the part-time greenhorns yourself, what an admirable representative! A model of merchants!\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is getting stuffy in here, and I feel like I am being bad mouthed. By the way, aren\u2019t your hobbies slowly getting more similar to Tomoe?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cAt first, it was by force, but\u2026in the end, I got used to it the more it was forced into me~~.\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>\u201cHey hey.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut lately, she has brought out things like period dramas, PCs, and western stuff. I have now learned about her depth and have opened my eyes~~.\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, the screen is still rustic and instead of calling it a PC, it is more like a word-processor though. It is thriving in a good sense which is something I love.\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I see.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right~~, hehe.\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd, what\u2019s your business?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Did she watch some sort of big play somewhere?</p><br/><p>It is Eris we are talking about, so she is probably focusing on weird things like the killer techniques of the actors.</p><br/><p>I understand that you are itching to talk about it, but I decided not to touch that topic today.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, how cold. But that part is what makes you good, is what one of the Gorgons said, you know? Also, you have a guest.\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have any appointment though. Who is it?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Of course, I didn\u2019t retort about the Gorgon.</p><br/><p>Jin and Amelia haven\u2019t met the Gorgons yet\u2026probably.</p><br/><p>In the future, I plan on having them fight the Gorgons as opponents that can defeat you the instant you encounter them.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is a companion of those younglings here. Gizumo\u2026or was it Rizumo?\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>\u201cIzumo.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cFufufu, how was it, Waka? Just by adding one syllable, I was able to change his name into a *scary and cute monster*, and even a *white and beautiful container*.\u201d (Eris) </p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play around with people\u2019s names. Izumo huh, that\u2019s unusual. Well, I will see what he has to say.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I will guide you~.\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>\u201cEris, you don\u2019t need to. Help out the two\u2014\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cSince they were so slow, I already finished half of it. The remaining can be done by those two. With their pace, they should be able to finish in around an hour.\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Nothing escapes you.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cWithout fail. Banana?\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay okay. Well then, Jin and Amelia, I am counting on you for what\u2019s left. Go at your own pace.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYay! Hey, do your best, younglings!\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>Eris moved ahead in high spirits.</p><br/><p>She had both of her hands at the back of her head and was in a good mood.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way. She really finished everything on that side\u2026\u201d (Amelia)</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you telling me that when you are at the level of Eris-san, you can arrange the inventory by simply speaking? That\u2019s a whole different dimension. How scary is the clone law.\u201d (Jin)</p><br/><p>\u201cWas it a law? Wasn\u2019t it a skill name?\u201d (Amelia)</p><br/><p>I leave the two that were shuddering at the pleasant work of Eris, and head to the store where Izumo is waiting for me.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so, what did you want to talk with me about without the presence of Shiki?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Izumo had a meek face as he waited.</p><br/><p>The words that came out were Lorel Union.</p><br/><p>I thought it was going to be that topic again, but with an expression as if brooding over something, he said that he wanted to speak alone with me.</p><br/><p>This is really something unusual.</p><br/><p>Because Izumo clearly relies on Shiki more than me.</p><br/><p>But the home of Izumo is Lorel Union, and he is a student at the academy we have no hostility towards.</p><br/><p>Since he went through the trouble of coming here, I decide to listen to what he has to say.</p><br/><p>We couldn\u2019t just have a conversation in the store, so we went to my room.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are going to Lorel Union, right?\u201d (Izumo)</p><br/><p>\u201cFor a negotiation. Let me clear this first, there\u2019s no changes in the class schedule.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, yes. So, what part of Lorel are you heading to?\u201d (Izumo)</p><br/><p>\u2026It looks like he is quite agitated.</p><br/><p>Izumo is the type that would ask a lot of things like: \u2018how are you going to continue class as normal if you are heading to Lorel?\u2019 and \u2018How are you going to be returning here?\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026We are heading to a city named Kannaoi. From there, well, we will be heading to the dungeon.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c?!!! Could it be\u2026you are heading to the great dungeon Yaso-Katsui?!\u201d (Izumo)</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected of a famous place in Lorel. That\u2019s right. In Rotsgard, there was no one who knew this name aside from the adventurers.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Without nodding or making any sort of reaction to my words, Izumo maintained his mouth shut.</p><br/><p>However\u2026looking at this, does Izumo have some sort circumstances with this dungeon?</p><br/><p>Now that I think about it, Shiki said something Izumo\u2019s household before.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Is that negotiation going to be with\u2026the Ikusabe or the Osakabe?\u201d (Izumo)</p><br/><p>\u201cNone, it is with a mercenary group called Picnic Rose Garden.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What\u2019s wrong?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>The strained face of Izumo had suddenly turned into an emotionless one.</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t even tell if he is surprised.</p><br/><p>And he said something that bothered me as well.</p><br/><p>Ikusabe? Osakabe?</p><br/><p>Those are names I haven\u2019t heard from Sairitz-san either.</p><br/><p>Now that I think about it, I am going to be receiving a promissory note that can let me go anywhere, but I haven\u2019t really been told about the details of the country itself.</p><br/><p>The most I have heard is that there\u2019s no civil wars and it is mostly peaceful.</p><br/><p>When I asked if it is slightly stormy there, she told me: \u2018In our territory, only a little\u2019, and laughed.</p><br/><p>That \u2018territory\u2019 of hers is a real scary one. </p><br/><p>But well, every large country must have their own share of political strife, and if it\u2019s only that, it can be counted as peaceful.</p><br/><p>Hm, right.</p><br/><p>Ikusabe is the family name of Izumo.</p><br/><p>Ah!</p><br/><p>If I remember correctly, Shiki said something about Izumo and the main and branch family at Lorel.</p><br/><p>I see.</p><br/><p>Are Kannaoi and Yaso-Katsui places that his household possess a strong influence?</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why Izumo was bothered by that destination of ours.</p><br/><p>Wait, places where his household possess a strong influence?</p><br/><p>If that\u2019s really the case\u2026does that mean that Izumo is from quite a distinguished family?</p><br/><p>Could it be\u2026he is an actual *Waka-sama*?! </p><br/><p>\u201cPicnic\u2026Rose Garden\u2026\u201d (Izumo)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe safeguards of Yaso-Katsui dungeon. That mercenary group?\u201d (Izumo)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019m surprised you know.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cSensei!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUo, what\u2019s wrong, Izumo?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t bother with me\u2026with someone like me!!\u201d (Izumo)</p><br/><p>\u201cHah?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is fine! No matter if Sensei holds the side of Ikusabe or Osakabe, it just doesn\u2019t matter anymore!! I somewhat understand that Sairitz-sama has finally made her move after all!\u201d (Izumo)</p><br/><p>Izumo suddenly stood up and poured some intense words at me who is still sitting.</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t understand at all.</p><br/><p>I am sorry but, I am not really involved in any of what he is saying.</p><br/><p>Not that I think about it, I feel like I am now pretty used to matching my tone when speaking, like in the times when I speak with the other teachers. It might be imprudent of me to be thinking this at this moment though.</p><br/><p>\u201cCalm down. I will say this clearly, I don\u2019t understand anything of what you are saying. It is true that Sairitz-sama has spoken to me, but it is a negotiation with the mentioned mercenary group. I have not heard about the Ikusabe or the Osakabe at all.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Moreover, she didn\u2019t tell me to keep this a secret.</p><br/><p>It seems like the mercenary group is quite the big shot in Lorel, so it is not strange for him to know about them. So leaving that aside, she didn\u2019t say a single word about Izumo.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was told that if it is me, I would be able to pull it off. I will bring along some companions and negotiate for a bit with the mercenary group. That\u2019s all.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cUhm, Sensei, you said \u2018for a bit\u2019 but\u2026do you really know where those people are?\u201d (Izumo)</p><br/><p>Izumo was in the middle of a roller coaster of emotions, but it seems like he has entered a lull state and asks me with a serious expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. Inside Yaso-Katsui labyrinth, right?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Is that all?\u201d (Izumo)</p><br/><p>\u201cI was told that they are based 20 floors underground.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s correct.\u201d (Izumo)</p><br/><p>\u201cI honestly feel it is a complete pain to do this, but we are the ones that want to negotiate with them, so it can\u2019t be helped.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Sensei, how many do you see here?\u201d (Izumo)</p><br/><p>He lifts two fingers in front of me.</p><br/><p>\u201cTwo.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, this?\u201d (Izumo)</p><br/><p>\u201cFive.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, what about this?\u201d (Izumo)</p><br/><p>\u201cTen. By the way, what are you trying to achieve with this, Izumo-kun? Even I know that the double of that is twenty.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe 20th floor underground of that labyrinth!! Is not a place that you can simply go for a bit to have a negotiation, you know?!!\u201d (Izumo)</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand. It is dark, confined, and honestly, I don\u2019t feel like doing it.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cDark, confined?!!\u201d (Izumo)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt might take two days; if I count the negotiation, it will probably take around three days.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible Impossible Impossible Impossible Impossible!!\u201d (Izumo)</p><br/><p>What\u2019s with that shower of words as if using a rush attack?! </p><br/><p>His tongue said that really smoothly.</p><br/><p>He can become a sales announcer.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will say this again and again, calm down.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible!! I refuse to! There\u2019s no way I can calm down! Eastern part of Lorel, former capital: Kannaoi! And what has existed since ancient times and brought up Kannaoi, the Yaso-Katsui valley and its labyrinth that extends underground!\u201d (Izumo)</p><br/><p>\u201cOh~.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd then, there\u2019s the legendary mercenary group that\u2019s said to have been created by the Wise to protect our ancestors, Picnic Rose Garden!\u201d (Izumo)</p><br/><p>That name\u2026really doesn\u2019t fit.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why I am sure there\u2019s no doubt a Wise(japanese person) was involved in the creation of that mercenary group.</p><br/><p>Not as legends, but people that actually existed.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026It seems like Sensei really didn\u2019t know this. Okay then, I will teach you. Ignorance is a sin at times, but there are times when it is easy to atone for those sins. It is okay to just know about it at the time you need to know.\u201d (Izumo)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo well, I have already received information to a certain extent\u2026\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Actually, I even think that there\u2019s no need to know more aside from the fact that we will be negotiating.</p><br/><p>No matter how much you tell me about the place being confined, gloomy, and dark, I will not be happy at all anyways.</p><br/><p>I can make the inside bright unlike games, I don\u2019t need to mind about mapping the place, and I can just single mindedly go down without caring about treasures.</p><br/><p>First of all, this guy should stop those eyes of his.</p><br/><p>Please stop those crazed eyes.</p><br/><p>I would like more energetic eyes.</p><br/><p>Kugh, did I step in some kind of landmine? I can\u2019t pinpoint it.</p><br/><p>Was it about his family? Or was it the Picnic mercenary group? Maybe it is because of the 20th floor underground?</p><br/><p>Or more like, aren\u2019t those mercenaries being really loved?</p><br/><p>Is it really okay to bring them to Tsige?</p><br/><p>From the way Sairitz-san spoke, they felt like problematic people\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t be so reserved. Sensei has really taken care of me, so it is only at this kind of moments where I can repay you. Information about Kannaoi, Yaso-Katsui, the labyrinth, Ikusabe and Osakabe household, and about the Wise and the legendary mercenary group. I will have you listen to everything thoroughly, okay?!\u201d (Izumo)</p><br/><p>Yeah.</p><br/><p>Rather than calling this a repayment, this is more like hearing him complain.</p><br/><p>I have been thinking about listening to my students if they open up to me themselves, but\u2026this kind of beginning is not to my taste!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

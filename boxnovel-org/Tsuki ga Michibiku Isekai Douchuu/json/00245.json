There\u2019s two reasons for this, but in essence, there\u2019s only one.</p><br/><p>First, because of the identity of Iroha-chan that Tomoe told us after Iroha-chan had gone to sleep.</p><br/><p>And the second, the follow-up of her bodyguards.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat girl is the princess of the influential military family, Osakabe from Kannaoi.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>I did expect it, but it was exactly as I thought.</p><br/><p>The aged man, his name was Shougetsu, right?</p><br/><p>He also said something about Kannaoi, and I got cold sweat just thinking about how we may have done something incorregible the very first day we entered Mizuha.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut she isn\u2019t a princess with that much power. The Osakabe is a big household, so it seems like there\u2019s a lot of princesses and princes.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>But it seems like we are somewhat safe in that part.</p><br/><p>If there\u2019s a lot of them and it isn\u2019t as if she has much power, there\u2019s still plenty room to redeem it.</p><br/><p>And so, for the sake of that, we will have to keep Iroha-chan\u2019s mood from being harmed, and we also have to properly talk with her bodyguards.</p><br/><p>It looks like she is attached to Tomoe, so the former one seems to be okay, that\u2019s why, what\u2019s next is to have a talk with Shougetsu-san and the others.</p><br/><p>The promissory note of Sairitz-san can serve as proof for our identities.</p><br/><p>Leaving aside the relationship between families, I think I can expect some effectivity.</p><br/><p>It is fine as long as it serves as the impetus for a conversation.</p><br/><p>Also, it seems like Iroha-chan herself doesn\u2019t know, but Sairitz-san has probably told the influential families about the Kuzunoha company and about Raidou as well.</p><br/><p>Based on her personality, she wouldn\u2019t let me inside the country without doing at least this much.</p><br/><p>I am sorry for Tomoe, but it would be a bit hard for me to play as Koumon-sama while carrying a bomb.</p><br/><p>Maybe we should quickly find those guys and finish the talk with them.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026As expected, you will be going?\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were awake huh.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cI am paying attention to the surroundings. If they attack this place, I was thinking about playing around with them.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s some in our vicinity huh.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cShe is their princess after all. They most likely investigated desperately. Hm?\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Seems like Tomoe noticed something, her gaze turns to the side.</p><br/><p>Geh, are they attacking?</p><br/><p>We were one step too late huh.</p><br/><p>\u201cWaka, that.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026The katana of Iroha-chan? For a sword that a child has in her possession, it even has magic power clad in it though.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>It is glowing.</p><br/><p>Well even if I say so, it is only a bit that\u2019s leaking out from the scabbard.</p><br/><p>That hue was gentle, it reminded me of the light of fireflies.</p><br/><p>When she was swinging it around, it was also glowing, but for what purpose?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like it is doing anything bad, but want to try unsheathing it?\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t wake up Mio and Iroha-chan, okay?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cI know.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Tomoe unsheathes the katana without any restraint. </p><br/><p>It seems like it is not the type that can\u2019t be unsheathed unless it is the owner.</p><br/><p>Hmph~.</p><br/><p>The edge part is letting out a faint light from here and there as it coils around it.</p><br/><p>It doesn\u2019t seem like the katana itself is glowing.</p><br/><p>It is as if a lot of small grains of light were overlapping together\u2026?!!!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat could this be? The magic power it is letting off is so feeble that I just can\u2019t grasp it\u2026 I can understand that this is not a katana that\u2019s oriented for battle, but\u2026it is well-made for an artistic good.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cTomoe, about the place where the light is strong\u2026\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t the edge chipped?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cEdge chipped? Oh, now that you mention it, there\u2019s a small chip.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>I think it is different from what I am thinking.</p><br/><p>Someone who knew about the original one, made a replica of it.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s definitely the case.</p><br/><p>In the first place, there\u2019s no way it would exist in this world, and it wouldn\u2019t be the size of a short sword and used as a katana to protect a kid.</p><br/><p>It was my misunderstanding.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. Well\u2026put it away.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cAs you will.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Seeing my state, Tomoe tilts her head and nods.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways, I will be going.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cIn my opinion, I would prefer to stay like this until Beren and the others join us though\u2026\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cNope. I will be going.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Waka says so, it can\u2019t be helped. Do your best in filling that crack.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know what might occur from now on, you know. It is best to not increase the trouble pointlessly.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so. As you will. Lorel seems to be a country that\u2019s more fun than I thought it would be, so I will step back from this one.\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah yeah.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>We still have the labyrinth waiting for us.</p><br/><p>Also *Futsu*. </p><br/><p>In Lorel, there\u2019s quite a lot of people that know about it.</p><br/><p>Even though it was a dragon that I didn\u2019t hear at all of in Rotsgard.</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t tell at all what kind of existence it is.</p><br/><p>I haven\u2019t even heard that name from Root before.</p><br/><p>But well, I don\u2019t want to go through the trouble of going back to ask him.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s plenty enough time in the moments I have classes at the Academy.</p><br/><p>Right now, what\u2019s most important is Shougetsu-san.</p><br/><p>From what Tomoe said, they are close to the inn, so everyone should be alright.</p><br/><p>If I leave the inn alone, it is almost certain that they will make contact with me.</p><br/><p>At this occasion, it can\u2019t be helped if I end up being attacked.</p><br/><p>It is the usual.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6</p><br/><p>For example; if in a fishing game, there\u2019s a bait called \u2018Misumi Makoto\u2019, its rarity would be the highest.</p><br/><p>They would all bite and the bait would be worn out.</p><br/><p>If there was an accessory in RPGs with the name \u2018Misumi Makoto\u2019, only the encounter rate of the troublesome enemies would increase massively.</p><br/><p>The rarity\u2026would be trash level.</p><br/><p>In other words, when I left the inn so that Shougetsu-san and the others would attack me, I received attacks that surpassed the two digits.</p><br/><p>Even in a big city, no, it is exactly because it is a big city that walking alone is dangerous though.</p><br/><p>On top of that, I staggeringly walked out from Mizuha\u2019s number one inn.</p><br/><p>Hahahaha, I understand that this is my just desserts.</p><br/><p>Even so! Attack me sooner, you guys!</p><br/><p>Is what I thought for a slight instant.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat household are you from?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMisumi household.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I tested saying this.</p><br/><p>It would be troublesome if I introduce myself and there\u2019s a Misumi family in this country after all.</p><br/><p>No matter if Sairitz-san\u2019s influence is strong, she wouldn\u2019t be able to change the name of an entire household just because of me.</p><br/><p>\u201cMisumi? Uhm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I haven\u2019t heard of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is not a name I know of.\u201d</p><br/><p>The bodyguards, old man, and the servant-looking people shake their heads sideways.</p><br/><p>Then there\u2019s no problem in introducing myself normally then.</p><br/><p>I was dragged into a building that doesn\u2019t seem to be in use, was tied to a chair, and was left in the middle of the room.</p><br/><p>It is a room with no windows.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you kidnap Iroha-sama?\u201d</p><br/><p>The one in charge of my interrogation seems to be a woman named Akashi-san.</p><br/><p>Yuduki-san was also right by her side, and Shougetsu-san and the other women were slightly further at the back.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026one of my companions mistook you all for bad guys that wanted to kidnap a child.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat scene had circumstances involved, and we did say that it was a misunderstanding, you know.\u201d (Akashi)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, you are right. Ah, are your burns alright?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c!! It is not something you bastard should be concerned abo\u2014\u201d (Akashi)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026We are fine. We have finished the treatment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Akashi-san seemed to be angered, but Yuduki-san had a calm face all around as she answered me.</p><br/><p>They are mostly women, so I was secretly worried.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great. I was worried it would leave scars.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026And so, you are going to return Iroha-sama, right?\u201d (Akashi)</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. We don\u2019t have any intentions of hurting that princess-sama.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow then, I think doing this will make us return to the first question all over again, that question about \u2018who are you?\u2019. Ah, Akashi-san, can you please check the left pocket of my coat?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2019Check out the place you couldn\u2019t check before\u2019, is that what you are saying?!\u201d (Akashi)</p><br/><p>Before being tied, I was thoroughly searched all over my body by Akashi-san and Yuduki-san.</p><br/><p>My coat is a special article that you can\u2019t take off the buttons unless it is me, so it must have made them pass an unpleasant time.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am a merchant, so there are some things I wouldn\u2019t want others to see. You two were groping my whole body a while ago, so in that situation\u2026I couldn\u2019t do much, you know.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cWho would want to touch your body because they want to?!\u201d (Akashi)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Akashi, change. Your left pocket, right? This is\u2026a promissory note?\u201d (Yuduki)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I think this will serve as proof of my identity.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, this is\u2026\u201d (Yuduki)</p><br/><p>Yuduki-san lightens her hand with magic, and looks carefully at the promissory note.</p><br/><p>Yuduki-san is intellectual and can be reasoned with.</p><br/><p>Akashi-san is impulsive, and when hostile, it makes it hard to make a conversation with her.</p><br/><p>For this situation, Yuduki-san is the most suited one, but\u2026in my opinion, Akashi-san is the one that gives me the better impression.</p><br/><p>She doesn\u2019t look like she is two-faced, so that\u2019s what I think with that one point.</p><br/><p>I might be a serious case of two-facedness though.</p><br/><p>\u201cShougetsu-sama.\u201d (Yuduki)</p><br/><p>\u201cUmu. What is it? The family crest of Kahara?! Also, this shape\u2026the highest of accommodations?\u201d (Shougetsu)</p><br/><p>As I thought, it had extraordinary effect.</p><br/><p>This is a promissory note that an influential person of Lorel has given to an outside guest, so I can expect diplomatic-like effects as well.</p><br/><p>The feudal lords, nobles, and military families are weak against this kind of things.</p><br/><p>Well, rather than weak, it is more like, it can properly deal with them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe name at the back is\u2026Sairitz herself. Could it be\u2026\u201d (Shougetsu)</p><br/><p>\u201cShougetsu-sama?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAkashi, Yuduki, untie the rope.\u201d (Shougetsu)</p><br/><p>\u201cW-Why?!\u201d (Akashi)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat promissory note alone doesn\u2019t warrant untying the rope. They have kidnapped Iroha-sama here!\u201d (Yuduki)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat person, Raidou-dono\u2026is a Wise.\u201d (Shougetsu)</p><br/><p>?</p><br/><p>He asserted it?</p><br/><p>Now that I think about it, that soldier also did that, but\u2026is that something that can be asserted by only the outward appearance.</p><br/><p>Akashi-san and Yuduki-san have been treating me fairly roughly here though.</p><br/><p>In other words, my appearance is terrible, but even so, with only a few similar traits, you can\u2019t just pinpoint a person as a Wise.</p><br/><p>The similar points of that soldier and Shougetsu-san\u2026</p><br/><p>They saw the promissory note.</p><br/><p>But Yuduki-san did as well.</p><br/><p>No, if it\u2019s only looking, Tomoe, Mio, and I have done so too.</p><br/><p>We three didn\u2019t read or see anything that pointed me as a Wise in that promissory note.</p><br/><p>In that case\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can guess the person is a Wise by the promissory note, or there\u2019s some inner information that can be used to pinpoint it?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>A part that only people with an official position can understand.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s the most probable possibility.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust as you have guessed. Also, to think you were the Raidou-dono of Kuzunoha company. It is certainly true that just having the name of that fox woman is not enough but, it looks like I have no choice but to see this as a misunderstanding from both sides.\u201d (Shougetsu)</p><br/><p>Shougetsu-san makes a big sigh and shows me a smile.</p><br/><p>A gentle smile.</p><br/><p>It seems like the first compromise has been reached, maybe.</p><br/><p>Damn it, that promissory note.</p><br/><p>For what reason was it made to treat me as Wise?</p><br/><p>Is this also a setup from Sairitz-san directed at the mercenary group?</p><br/><p>Rather than a demi-human looking person, they would treat me better if I am seen as a Wise. It doesn\u2019t have much demerits for me, which makes it even more unpleasant.</p><br/><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t consented yet though!\u201d (Akashi)</p><br/><p>\u201cMe neither. I understand that Iroha-sama has not gathered enough attention from the world to the point of appointing a Wise-sama as an assassin, but\u2026\u201d (Yuduki)</p><br/><p>Akashi-san and Yuduki-san are still heavily on guard.</p><br/><p>If I had to place a stance on the servants, I would say they don\u2019t agree either.</p><br/><p>It is only Shougetsu-san who understands a variety of things and has given up on doing anything to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is only on a limited amount of people, but the notification has reached me as well. There will be a company that will be going to the Yaso-Katsui labyrinth, so if that group has the Kahara household\u2019s promissory note, we should cooperate.\u201d (Shougetsu)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly who we are.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. Akashi, Yuduki!\u201d (Shougetsu)</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood!\u201d (Akashi)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Understood.\u201d (Yuduki)</p><br/><p>Because of the strict tone of Shougetsu-san, I was finally freed.</p><br/><p>But the dissatisfaction of the two is strong.</p><br/><p>They don\u2019t seem to like it at all.</p><br/><p>For now, they have returned me my promissory note.</p><br/><p>Well, it is that huh. It is okay to be treated as a Wise in the time I am in this country.</p><br/><p>It would be a pain to try and negate it\u2014ah!</p><br/><p>Could it be that this is all within Sairitz-san\u2019s plan?</p><br/><p>No, let\u2019s stop it.</p><br/><p>If I end up overthinking it, I will only be digging deeper.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are in a season that\u2019s troublesome in a lot of meanings, you see. Please forgive us for our excessive behaviour.\u201d (Shougetsu)</p><br/><p>\u201cSame here. Iroha-sama is resting at ease, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThen tomorrow\u2026fumu, no\u2026\u201d (Shougetsu)</p><br/><p>Okay, the problem has been resolved.</p><br/><p>This is how it should be.</p><br/><p>Nothing good comes from carrying the problem until it becomes bigger.</p><br/><p>It must be severed while it is still budding.</p><br/><p>This is what you call growing.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, in the morning, I will tell Iroha-sama as well that there was a misunderstanding\u2014\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cRaidou-dono.\u201d (Shougetsu)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>What is it?</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something I want to talk to you about. Since you left at such late hours, it must mean that you were intending on providing us your time, is that right?\u201d (Shougetsu)</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, of course. Uhm, I thought our talk was wrapped up a few moments ago though.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cTo tell you the truth, there\u2019s some circumstances involving why Iroha-sama is currently in Mizuha.\u201d (Shougetsu)</p><br/><p>\u201cShougetsu-sama?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man talks, and the other four look at him with expressions of surprise.</p><br/><p>I remember the cursed words of Tomoe.</p><br/><p>No, I won\u2019t remember them.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t want to.</p><br/><p>My growth, my growth is\u2026!</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it is not like Raidou-dono and Iroha-sama are completely unrelated to it. Izumo-sama is your student, right?\u201d (Shougetsu)</p><br/><p>\u201c?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>So we are pulling this now huh.</p><br/><p>It would be a different story if this were to spare me from diving into the labyrinth!! But this just one-sidedly increase my job!!</p><br/><p>T-This is not funny.</p><br/><p>At this rate, my other students might bring me more trouble too. Jin\u2026I currently can\u2019t find anything; Amelia, well, if it is related to Shiki, I won\u2019t need to do anything; Misura\u2019s problem has to do with the church, the number one place I don\u2019t like; in Daena\u2019s case, married problems, I ask that they don\u2019t trouble me with those; the matter with the Rembrandt sisters has already been resolved.</p><br/><p>Even so, I feel like Jin and Amelia might still be holding some kind of bomb.</p><br/><p>Even Izumo who didn\u2019t cause trouble until now is like this, you know.</p><br/><p>I see.</p><br/><p>Iroha-chan is his\u2026</p><br/><p>They really don\u2019t think at all about the difference in age huh.</p><br/><p>It feels like the scenario where two old men were drinking tea while deciding if to marry each other\u2019s next born child.</p><br/><p>Okay, I will listen to what you have to say.</p><br/><p>It is related with me.</p><br/><p>Because it is not assured that\u2026it will be resolved smoothly after all!!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

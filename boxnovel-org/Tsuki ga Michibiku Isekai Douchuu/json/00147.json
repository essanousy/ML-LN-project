Eris had her knees curled up sitting down and rubbing the roof with her index finger.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t show any signs of answering my question and was looking at me bitterly.</p><br/><p>\u201cW-Waka-sama, I have thought about this before but, how in the world did you enter here?\u201d (Akua)</p><br/><p>With a deeply exhausted expression, Akua showed even more mental fatigue and surprise.</p><br/><p>In contrast to Eris, Akua had a beautiful upright posture as if a ruler was placed at her back.</p><br/><p>After going through the camp training, her personality had turned quite diligent, and it may be hard for her to make follow-ups for Eris.</p><br/><p>Maybe I should have one more person accompanying them to make it a group of three.</p><br/><p>If that person has to group up with these two, it might be pretty hard to select the appropriate person.</p><br/><p>The standplay of this combi is pretty intense, so even when they are among Forest Onis, these two stand out.</p><br/><p>How troubling.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe way I entered? In that case, Eris probably already noticed. There\u2019s still some time till she recovers, so can I ask something Akua?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cY-Yes, what is it?\u201d (Akua)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you used this in the Student Dormitory, why are you both inside?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u201d (Akua)</p><br/><p>With a pained expression, Akua moans and stays silent.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t purposely, but an accident then?</p><br/><p>With Eris here, that\u2019s actually possible.</p><br/><p>\u201cEris huh\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cN-No! I didn\u2019t think about what would happen and\u2026\u201d (Akua)</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you plunged into the craziness of Eris\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cAw\u2026 yes. Something like that\u201d (Akua)</p><br/><p>\u201cFortunately, aside from the fact that you can\u2019t leave, there\u2019s no other problems. Well, good work. And so, is there anything you need to report?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. There\u2019s not much harm from inside.</p><br/><p>But this spell is a defensive barrier, and yet, it has a dangerous sounding name like Kokytus.</p><br/><p>If I remember correctly, it is the name of the ice hell.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know if Eris knew about it when naming it, but for a simple babysitting barrier, it is way too unfit.</p><br/><p>It is easy to understand the reason for the name when you try to carelessly get close from outside.</p><br/><p>Well, the Academy is leading in the research of magic, so there shouldn\u2019t be an idiot who would do something like that but\u2026 you would get frozen.</p><br/><p>No, I wonder if that can be considered \u2018frozen\u2019.</p><br/><p>It is more like, a sherbet maybe?</p><br/><p>A highland orc that got close to it instantly had half of his arm frozen white.</p><br/><p>In an instantaneous response, he severed his own arm with the other, so he got away with only that, but the fallen arm dispersed like diamond dust and crumbled.</p><br/><p>A frightening spell.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, there\u2019s nothing really worth reporting\u201d (Akua)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, there is\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>\u201c?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Eris suddenly joined the conversation.</p><br/><p>So she recovered already huh.</p><br/><p>\u201cEris\u2026\u201d (Akua)</p><br/><p>\u201cFuh, they say that failure is the mother of success. Next time I will try even harder\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. So, Eris, you said you had something to report\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>If I retort to everything, the conversation won\u2019t progress, so, when I am hurry, I decide to not retort.</p><br/><p>With a slightly discontent expression, Eris nods.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe ones that might be the ringleaders are probably gathering at a luxurious house\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Heh~\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe movements of the variants become organized at times, so it picked my curiosity and I laid out a net\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Eris, I haven\u2019t heard about any of this though?\u201d (Akua)</p><br/><p>\u201cAkua was doing my part of the work while I was doing that. Thanks\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>\u201cUgu\u201d (Akua)</p><br/><p>\u201cContinue\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. They are probably using some sort of tool that \u2013 even when imperfect \u2013 it controls the variants. Something like that.\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>\u201cControl\u2026\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like the variants are gathering. The rich are in trouble\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>Eris says: \u201cOver there\u201d and points at the place where a lot of wealthy live at.</p><br/><p>It is the section that the Academy is putting most of its forces in.</p><br/><p>Tomoe for some reason didn\u2019t put much of our forces at that place.</p><br/><p>I think that it would be faster to gather support by having the people living there like us, but I wonder.</p><br/><p>It would be better to hear it in detail from the person herself huh.</p><br/><p>Commanding the variants is new information.</p><br/><p>I should confirm that as well.</p><br/><p>But Eris\u2019 information gathering is quite high.</p><br/><p>On top of that, I feel like she is getting even better at it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks Eris. That helped a lot\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThose words are wasted on me. This spell as well, it isn\u2019t even a pain to use it as an emergency measure in order to protect Waka\u2019s precious students from falling in the hands of the Academy Principal. And that\u2019s how it is. I want you to please forgive Akua\u2019s spontaneous discharge of the barrier\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>\u2026 As soon as I say thanks, she comes out with this.</p><br/><p>Eris is truly a mystery.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I am angry about it. If you want to, I can even bring you out of here. I will lead the way\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cR-Right now it\u2019s fine. I am worried about the students, so I think I will stay here until it melts\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>Because outside there\u2019s Mondo huh.</p><br/><p>But if they go outside, Tomoe will probably be giving out rewards for the Forest Onis, so there is also a good part.</p><br/><p>\u2026 Well, okay.</p><br/><p>I am also slightly tired, so if Eris says she wants to stay here, I will just let her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. Then that\u2019s fine. Well, I will be returning outside\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks for your hard work, Waka. If possible, please give my regards to Shishou\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>\u201cI refuse\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cS-So cruel\u201d (Eris)</p><br/><p>I leave Akua and Eris, and leave the barrier.</p><br/><p>Reunite with Tomoe and the others, meet with the Academy Principal, and after that\u2026 what should I do?</p><br/><p>\u201cRaidou-dono, are you returning now?\u201d</p><br/><p>N?</p><br/><p>In a place slightly far from the barrier, I was called from the courtyard of a shelter.</p><br/><p>Oh, an unexpected person.</p><br/><p>[Sairitz-sama. This may be my imagination, but you look a bit tired. Are you okay?]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 How embarrassing. Even though you should be several times more tired than me\u201d (Sairitz)</p><br/><p>[The Academy Principal and us are doing our best to resolve the issue. Please endure for a bit longer]</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. So shameful. For me to be so tense just because communication has been severed\u201d (Sairitz)</p><br/><p>[I think that\u2019s a natural mood]</p><br/><p>I am dealing with this without problems, I think.</p><br/><p>And yet, the eyes of Sairitz-san suddenly turn sharp.</p><br/><p>Eyes that feel as if they could see through. An unpleasant sensation.</p><br/><p>\u201cRaidou-dono, no, Raidou-sama, I understand that this incident is being led to resolution by another power that is not the Academy. There\u2019s someone pulling its hand from the shadows. Even I can tell something like that, and most likely, Princess Lily has noticed this as well. The Limia King also doesn\u2019t have eyes for decoration. The exceptions are the eyes of Aion. And it seems Rembrandt Company has already given up on taking you in\u201d (Sairitz)</p><br/><p>As expected, the high-ups can see that we are moving from the shadows huh.</p><br/><p>Should I ask her to please not interfere?</p><br/><p>But if I handle this poorly, I feel like it will increase the problems.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe power of Kuzunoha Company \u2013 even if it\u2019s only a part of it \u2013 I have understood it. Even if Raidou-sama is a Wise-sama, I can\u2019t imagine how you were able to gather so many strong people and created an organization. Could it be that you have awakened what you personages sometimes possess, the superhuman mental processing, or it could be that you have that rare business ability and charisma?\u201d (Sairitz)</p><br/><p>[You are overestimating me. I am not a Wise-sama, and I have no other way but to call this as a position I have been blessed to be born in]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Right now, you are clearly not intending to use it. After this, by the suggestion of the Guild Master Falz-dono, a meeting will be made to discuss several things about the Kuzunoha Company, but Lorel Union is thinking about positively accepting Raidou-sama, Kuzunoha Company\u201d (Sairitz)</p><br/><p>[Thank you very much]</p><br/><p>Oh, what a welcoming proposal.</p><br/><p>It would be great if that was all she had to say, but her eyes are still scary, so I can tell that it isn\u2019t over yet.</p><br/><p>\u201cRaidou-sama, please listen to this and consider it the will of Limia, Gritonia and Lorel\u201d (Sairitz)</p><br/><p>Sairitz-san draws one step closer, and mentions the names of the major powers.</p><br/><p>I-It sounds like a threat.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe role that the Kuzunoha Company is shouldering to resolve this incident is incredibly big. And I do think that it is not proper to ask this of you considering that\u201d (Sairitz)</p><br/><p>[Please continue]</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to ask you to fix the thought transmission urgently. If you are able to do it, I will reward you. Of course, I won\u2019t bring out the name of Kuzunoha Company regarding this matter\u201d (Sairitz)</p><br/><p>The restoration of the thought transmission huh.</p><br/><p>I see.</p><br/><p>If I tried to, I would be able to, but it would be bad if I don\u2019t confirm with Tomoe. Cause it might disrupt her plans.</p><br/><p>\u2018If I am able to, I will try to\u2019, should be the safe option.</p><br/><p>[I can\u2019t promise, but I will do my best to recover it]</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. It\u2019s fine, thanks Raidou-sama. I will let them know of what you have said. I am sorry to have kept you for so long\u201d (Sairitz)</p><br/><p>Sairitz-san lowers her head deeply.</p><br/><p>Following lead, I also lower my head.</p><br/><p>She returned to the place where her escorts were waiting at the far distance.</p><br/><p>So she kept the place secluded when meeting me.</p><br/><p>Fumu, if I restore the thought transmission, we would be able to know the location of the reinforcements of every country.</p><br/><p>That would be convenient, and if the communication is restored, the people taking shelter will suffer less stress.</p><br/><p>I want to do it, but let\u2019s try talking with Tomoe about this.</p><br/><p>A conversation that was tiring in a different meaning compared to when talking with Eris.</p><br/><p>Eat, do archery, get tired, drop down, sleep, and repeat; that is my ideal, but in this world, it just doesn\u2019t work that way.</p><br/><p>With loans, debts, and all the troublesome haggling that is probably happening here and there, it just makes my head hurt.</p><br/><p>Yareyare.</p><br/><p>I am truly glad that I have Tomoe and Shiki.</p><br/><p>\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an outrageous barrier. Those demi-human girls did this huh. I honestly don\u2019t want to fight you guys\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell well, to surprise even Myriad Color-dono, how truly pleasant-ja na. Fufufu\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is my first time seeing such a firm and aggressive barrier. If it\u2019s through force, one day. If I am to analyze it, I want at least 3 days. Seriously, when I am close to him, I don\u2019t get bored\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, you intend to break it?\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cBy no means. I am just interested. But if it doesn\u2019t last for several days, I won\u2019t be able to analyze it. And if I want to destroy it, I would have to return to my original form. If I transform into a dragon over something as petty as this and rampage, I would only be stacking up more panic on top of the variant uproar. And most importantly, Makoto-kun\u2019s impression of me would lower. I won\u2019t do it. Don\u2019t want to interfere with Makoto-kun\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Fuh, we don\u2019t mind holding the title of Dragon Slayer though. In terms of not being able to do anything, your side is more into that-ja shi\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease pardon me from that. And? Is it over by tomorrow?\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>Tomoe and Root were talking.</p><br/><p>Maybe there\u2019s no worries of anyone hearing, they are not using aliases, and they show no signs of hiding their plans.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how it is estimated-ja. A bit after the reinforcements arrive, we can just do the troublesome clean up and that\u2019s it-ja\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cTroublesome huh. And Makoto-kun?\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf the current Waka learns of this, he might turn into a bad direction. What should I do\u2026 It may be safer. I decided to clean up without telling him\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cI see\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s something troublesome-ja yo. If the ones stealthily doing things weren\u2019t the demon race, it would be easier. Demon General Rona huh. She probably wanted some results no matter how it rolled. Waka has to be a bit more experienced, or those kind of people will only serve as poison for him\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I remember correctly, Makoto-kun told her to withdraw her troops right?\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cUmu. I didn\u2019t enquire in detail if he said demon race or troops, but he did say it. She probably didn\u2019t listen to exactly what Waka asked, so there\u2019s not much point even if I ask in detail. Rona won\u2019t abide to it that much\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that sense, Makoto-kun is similar to Mio. Can be called good-natured, or careless\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>Root thinks of Makoto as if having fun.</p><br/><p>He isn\u2019t using complicated words with deep meaning.</p><br/><p>Makoto is the type that once someone listens to his request, he will honestly consider them as allies.</p><br/><p>It is a type of person that is easy to treat, but also dangerous.</p><br/><p>Because they easily hurry.</p><br/><p>Just that, even when Root understands all this, he still considers Makoto as interesting.</p><br/><p>He sees him as an existence that can \u201cstir up\u201d more than he has seen before.</p><br/><p>\u201cEarnestly training his body, shooting the bow; he is a person that lived his life with those activities as his core after all. He is thickheaded to the evil of the wide society-ja\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you are leaving the wealthy and the people that might be bad influence for Makoto-kun, for later?\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s simply because of my inclination. If the people there reduce in numbers, the reconstruction will be slightly smoother, right? Also, if you are displeased to the point that you want to take advantage of the situation and rampage, it would be better to let out your feelings, or it will haunt you later\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so, I should ignore the action of those demi-humans?\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a collaborator in the demon race aside from the blue-skinned. It\u2019s just that I thought it would be a bit too fast to show Waka. Mio will deal with it tonight\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, scary. So you won\u2019t vindicate her or shelter her?\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cShe is someone that hates hyumans unnecessarily much. I don\u2019t think she would be of much use. It\u2019s not like I am a protector of demi-humans or anything like that. Waka as well\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Tomoe indifferently talks about circumstances Makoto doesn\u2019t know about.</p><br/><p>The strange movements of the variants that the Forest Oni Eris noticed, Tomoe also noticed it.</p><br/><p>She also knows of the one that is controlling them.</p><br/><p>And she marked that person as someone that is in collaboration with the demon race.</p><br/><p>Just as Root said \u2018her\u2019, they also know the gender of that person.</p><br/><p>If they investigated, they would be able to learn more details, or maybe, they already know all the details.</p><br/><p>But for that person to move there, it seems Tomoe and Root didn\u2019t expect that.</p><br/><p>Thinking about the current Makoto\u2019s way of thinking and position, Tomoe decided to finish it without telling her master.</p><br/><p>Tomoe was secretly grateful that Makoto left the management of this turmoil to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso\u2026 wait for a bit\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>Tomoe was going to ask Root: \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d, but she shut her mouth herself.</p><br/><p>Thought transmission.</p><br/><p>Root probably noticed. Without interfering, he silently observes Tomoe\u2019s expression.</p><br/><p>Her face frowns for an instant.</p><br/><p>The content was probably not good. Root\u2019s interest was piqued.</p><br/><p>But after that, she returned to her normal face and continued the thought transmission. After several minutes, she silently exhales.</p><br/><p>Looks like her thought transmission finished.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom who?\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cWaka-ja\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cMakoto-kun! Heh~ what did he say? Did something happen inside the barrier?\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really don\u2019t show self-restraint. It wasn\u2019t anything big. It\u2019s just that, Waka was about to catch tail about that demi-human-ja\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph~, so he also noticed\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. It seems Eris said something. Seriously, that girl really does unnecessary things-ja na\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cI am slightly interested though. In the one who produced that demi-human\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, he asked me if it was okay to restore the thought transmission\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cHe asked? He is the master, so it should be fine if he just restores thought transmission if he wants to. Maybe he is showing restrain since he left you in charge?\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cMight be. There\u2019s already no problems with that, so I told him I don\u2019t mind\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>Root makes a strained expression and blurts out a question at the nonchalant words of Tomoe.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Do you have any problems with the restoration of the thought transmission? You will probably be able to see beautiful fireworks in person. Waka\u2019s handmade-ja\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, no\u2026 I see, right now huh\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou had me talk the whole time. Root, you are hiding something right?\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not so big enough to call it hiding. It\u2019s just that you didn\u2019t ask. Fumu\u2026\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you troubled? But you also made a strained expression. And right now you look like you are having fun-ja. Root, what are you hiding?\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou will probably notice as soon as the thought transmission is restored. Even so, Tomoe\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cHm?\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cFate probably does exist. How truly mysterious\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>With a meek countenance, Root mutters.</p><br/><p>Nodding several times, he consented while maintaining his silence.</p><br/><p>Tomoe, who is next to Root, sighs at him who has entered his own world.</p><br/><p>And then, she turns her eyes at the place where Makoto is currently at.</p><br/><p>She slowly turns her gaze upwards and waits for the moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cRoot, it\u2019s Waka-ja\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>\u201cHm?\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>With Tomoe\u2019s words and her finger pointing at the sky, Root looks up and sees a subdued yellow ball of light, that resembles the moon, being shot up.</p><br/><p>That light stops for a while in the sky as if illuminating the town.</p><br/><p>And then, it exploded.</p><br/><p>Turning into absurd amounts of strings, it didn\u2019t limit itself to the town, it rained on the whole zone.</p><br/><p>Some made acute angles, bending several times, and there are some that just go straight.</p><br/><p>Without a chance to defend against it, it pierces through the body of Root and Tomoe.</p><br/><p>\u201c?!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne shot huh. Waka is truly the type that polishes one talent-ja\u201d (Tomoe)</p><br/><p>Root who had his arms crossed, unlinked those arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat just now\u2026 could it be, it was aimed at what the demon race prepared?\u201d (Root)</p><br/><p>\u201cUmu. There\u2019s no real need to destroy them after all. As long as they stop working, that\u2019s fine. There\u2019s a method to do so, even without placing power in the attack.

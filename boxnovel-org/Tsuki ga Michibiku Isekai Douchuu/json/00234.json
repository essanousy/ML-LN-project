That\u2019s the name of the group. The problem is that they are in Lorel, but are a force that doesn\u2019t have intentions of being attached to a specific country.\u201d (Sairitz)</p><br/><p>Sairitz-san welcomed me happily when I entered the room, and after guiding me to my seat, she immediately said that name.</p><br/><p>It seems like it is a mercenary group that has high ability and excels at defense.</p><br/><p>Even so, they are not participating in the war.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s with that?</p><br/><p>Be it their name or their attitude, they are quite the shady group.</p><br/><p>In the first place, is a mercenary group able to get a decent amount of money if they don\u2019t participate in the war?</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd you are saying they will ally with Tsige as it currently is?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is at a stage where there\u2019s the possibility.\u201d (Sairitz)</p><br/><p>Sairitz-san shakes her head to the sides in regret.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that you had Rembrandt-san call me specifically. Why is that?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>For now, I don\u2019t see much reason as to why this should be related to me.</p><br/><p>In the first place, the mercenary group is staying at Lorel, so I don\u2019t have much understanding.</p><br/><p>Rather than me, I think that these are circumstances where Sairitz-san would have it easier than me.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are a slightly special existence in Lorel Union. They possess an ancestry with the Wise.\u201d (Sairitz)</p><br/><p>\u201cWise\u2026\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>She means Japanese people.</p><br/><p>Accurately speaking, she refers to the people that come from the same world as me, but after investigating, I can only think Wise are japanese. If that\u2019s not the case, they were people that possessed a lot of asian characteristics.</p><br/><p>Thinking about the special culture that has taken root in Lorel, it is practically settled that they were japanese.</p><br/><p>\u201cSairitz-sama, I have told you this before but\u2026I am\u2026\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are not a Wise, right? Yes, I understand. But in my eyes, Raidou-sama has enough traits to mistake you for a Wise-sama. The aforementioned mercenary group has strong faith towards the Wise because of their Wise ancestry, you see. If Raidou-sama were to go meet them, I think the conversation will go well. I -Sairitz- am sure of this.\u201d (Sairitz)</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Wise huh.</p><br/><p>I have heard this word many times already, but there\u2019s no doubt that\u2019s a word denoting japanese people.</p><br/><p>It seems like Lorel Union has been politely inviting the people that have slipped into this world to their country (not sure if that\u2019s really the case though).</p><br/><p>And by doing that, it affected the country\u2019s culture as well.</p><br/><p>For the people of Lorel Union, the Wise are special existences.</p><br/><p>Yeah, how to say it\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why it is me? Moreover, right now?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sairitz-san responds immediately with a smile.</p><br/><p>The Aion revolution is currently in a lull state, and from what I know, the matter of Koran is not a big problem.</p><br/><p>Tsige currently wants military force that can serve for their defense.</p><br/><p>If it were a small matter like going to the Academy to teach lessons, there would be no need for hesitation, but to go all the way to Lorel and negotiate with the mercenary group, and then bringing them here. That\u2019s a big job.</p><br/><p>But\u2026it is true that if we are to move, it has to be now.</p><br/><p>Even if I can come and go from there to Tsige, I would still have to stay at Lorel for several days.</p><br/><p>Sairitz-san, who still has that saint-like smile on her face, didn\u2019t avert her eyes from me.</p><br/><p>It is a face I can\u2019t handle well.</p><br/><p>For me who has been locked on by her since the time at the Academy festival and told to go to her country.</p><br/><p>Honestly speaking, I feel like it will be very troublesome.</p><br/><p>If only these insecurities weren\u2019t in the way, it is true that I would like to go to Lorel.</p><br/><p>\u201cUhm, Sairitz-sama, I do think as well that it would be beneficial to negotiate with that mercenary group. Thinking about the situation of Tsige, I can\u2019t leave for so long, and I think it will be difficult to have a prolonged leave from the country.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, I am not thinking about doing any formal event. Our priestess Chiya-sama is currently not in the country, and a person that serves as a replacement has not been elected either. It is disheartening that we are unable to entertain you adequately. You visiting our country is also one of our objectives, so in this time around, I was thinking about asking you to travel incognito. It may not be much in return, but I will do the best I can to accommodate the movements of the people of Kuzunoha company.\u201d (Sairitz)</p><br/><p>I was going to tell her to please spare me any stiffening events like the time when I went to Limia, but a joyful proposal was made.</p><br/><p>\u2026Fumu.</p><br/><p>In that case, I would be able to go quickly and return quickly, probably.</p><br/><p>I really do have a slight interest in Lorel, but with the situation of Tsige, there\u2019s no time for that.</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s a negotiation with a mercenary group, it will probably be done in a few days.</p><br/><p>Information of Kuzunoha company is relayed to me in real time, so in case anything happens, I can return immediately.</p><br/><p>If I don\u2019t need to worry about any strange entanglement with the country, this proposal of hers is valid.</p><br/><p>Yeah.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026You don\u2019t mind it being incognito?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I will prepare a promissory note by the time of your departure, so when you show that, you will be able to go anywhere you wish, Raidou-sama. I will also strongly order them to refrain doing any excessive reception. Of course, I will do my best to make it possible for Raidou-sama to make contact with the places and people that you get interested in.\u201d (Sairitz)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, there\u2019s no need to go that far.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Being given too many privileges will make me stand out instead.</p><br/><p>Just being able to freely walk in a foreign country is already a pretty big deal.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. Right now Lorel and I have been unable to give back anything worthy of repayment to Raidou-sama.\u201d (Sairitz)</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have saved Chiya-sama and I several times\u2026 That\u2019s how I feel.\u201d (Sairitz)</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd now then, about the place where the mercenary group, Picnic Rose Garden, are using as their base.\u201d (Sairitz)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, yes.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>It is probably in the capital.</p><br/><p>I know.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s always how it is.</p><br/><p>It seems like that group has a lot of freedom, but there\u2019s no doubt that Sairitz-san wants to invite me to the capital, so behind that smile of hers with no openings, she is definitely going to do something.</p><br/><p>Lorel\u2019s capital. If I remember correctly, the name\u2019s Naoi.</p><br/><p>Sairitz-san spreads out a map of Lorel as I was searching in my memories.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I unconsciously gulped.</p><br/><p>What she had spread out, was a pretty detailed map of Lorel Union.</p><br/><p>Towns, roads, and even the topography was shown.</p><br/><p>The current me understands the worth of this.</p><br/><p>\u2026There\u2019s no doubt that this map also shows confidential information of the country.</p><br/><p>This may be too late since I have already seen it but, I feel like I have been trapped in her scheme.</p><br/><p>It feels as if I am being led to her pace.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur Lorel wants to have a good relationship with the Kuzunoha company and Raidou-sama. If possible, we want to have a long lasting equivalent relationship. So for us, disclosing this amount of information is a given. Please don\u2019t mind it.\u201d (Sairitz)</p><br/><p>\u201cI also think that would be great. But it seems like your priestess-sama is scared of me, so I don\u2019t know if it is a good idea to show me this.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is certainly true that the words of our country\u2019s Priestess-sama are sacred. Her will translates to the will of the country, and there are many cases where it translates to the will of the people as well. However\u2026I don\u2019t know what Chiya-sama has seen of Raidou-sama, and what she feared of it, but currently, she is in a special standing in our country. In a sense, that is.\u201d (Sairitz)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018In a sense\u2019?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cI would have to explain various things if I were to delve deeper into it, which would be difficult to do with the limited time we have now. If I had to put it briefly\u2026it means that the words of the priestess are not necessarily always absolute.\u201d (Sairitz)</p><br/><p>\u201cNot absolute huh.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>From what I interpreted, the words of the Lorel priestess were practically absolute, but\u2026is that not the case?</p><br/><p>Also, Sairitz-san. I think she definitely did it on purpose but, when she said priestess, she didn\u2019t add the \u2018-sama\u2019.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s probably some sort of meaning behind that.</p><br/><p>It is a bit impossible for me to guess what that is though.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. For the people of Lorel, animosity towards the Priestess-sama is treated as a definite evil, but Raidou-sama doesn\u2019t see Chiya-sama in that way.\u201d (Sairitz)</p><br/><p>\u201cI have no intentions of bringing harm to the Priestess-sama.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>Just what kind of idiot would go through the trouble of being hostile to the person that a foreign country treats as valuable?</p><br/><p>In Japan, there\u2019s a great teaching saying that when entering a country, you should treat their people well.</p><br/><p>\u2026I slightly forgot that in the Empire though.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Thank you very much. And so, regarding the place that Raidou-sama will be going, it is here.\u201d (Sairitz)</p><br/><p>Just like I thought, Sairitz-san pointed at the capital of Lorel, Naoi\u2026and from there, she slowly moved her slender finger to the right.</p><br/><p>Eh?</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the second city of our country, Kannaoi. There was a time when this place was our capital, and there\u2019s been history of this city fighting with the current capital Naoi.\u201d (Sairitz) </p><br/><p>Kannaoi\u2026</p><br/><p>Hm?</p><br/><p>Naoi\u2026</p><br/><p>No wait, isn\u2019t that\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cKannaoi, is it. The mercenary group is there?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cRaidou-sama, is the name strange?\u201d (Sairitz)</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>I had my doubts, but I definitely didn\u2019t show it in my face, and yet, she saw through me.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, yeah. I was just thinking that Lorel really does have some peculiar names for their places.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I tell her the most plausible excuse I find.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. Actually, Naoi as well. It isn\u2019t recorded in the official history books, but there was a time when it was called Oonaoi, or something like that.\u201d (Sairitz)</p><br/><p>Oonaoi and Kannaoi.</p><br/><p>I also think\u2026that\u2019s the case.</p><br/><p>If that\u2019s really the case, the \u2018real\u2019 names would probably be Oonaobi and Kannaobi.</p><br/><p>Then there should be another place with a name similar to the other one.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I have derailed from the topic. Raidou-sama, after you have finished your preparations, can you please visit this other place that\u2019s slightly north?\u201d (Sairitz)</p><br/><p>Uwa, there it is.</p><br/><p>A place that definitely doesn\u2019t look safe.</p><br/><p>\u201cYaso-Katsui Valley. I want to ask you to please head to the labyrinth dungeon that stretches underground this valley.\u201d (Sairitz)</p><br/><p>Underground.</p><br/><p>Labyrinth.</p><br/><p>And Yaso-Katsui.</p><br/><p>It is probably Yaso-Katsu*hi*.</p><br/><p>It is probably based on the 80 calamities God, Yaso-Magatsuhi. </p><br/><p>Ah~, I have a bad feeling about this.</p><br/><p>Placing such a name to a valley.</p><br/><p>And it is underground, moreover, a labyrinth.</p><br/><p>In the first place, I don\u2019t like confined places much.</p><br/><p>I already had an experience not long ago which made me know that I hate participating in things like dungeons or labyrinths.</p><br/><p>The 80 calamities God wasn\u2019t necessarily an evil God, and there\u2019s people that worship him as a God that purifies misfortune, but\u2026in this case, I think the name was placed because it brings forth misfortune.</p><br/><p>Just what is it hiding there?</p><br/><p>The Goddess?</p><br/><p>Is it that damn Goddess?</p><br/><p>\u201cW-Why the labyrinth?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cAt the 20th floor of that labyrinth, also known as Rose Garden, they live there. I have already told them that we will be going there, so it is fine to go there to have a talk and negotiate.\u201d (Sairitz)</p><br/><p>20th floor underground?</p><br/><p>What\u2019s with that pleasant depth.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t tell me that labyrinth is connected to hell.</p><br/><p>Hm, labyrinth?</p><br/><p>Not a cave?</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like there\u2019s been a problem recently, but Yaso-Katsui labyrinth is currently calmed down. Raidou-sama shouldn\u2019t have any problems at all in that labyrinth, right?\u201d (Sairitz)</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way, uhm\u2026why is it not a cave but a labyrinth?\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, sorry for that. I thought that Raidou-sama would already know. What a blunder of mine.\u201d (Sairitz)</p><br/><p>Okay. Second bad feeling I am getting here.</p><br/><p>Why did Sairitz-san assume that I knew?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe big labyrinth that extends underground Yaso-Katsui is where the Superior Dragon \u2018Night Clad\u2019 lives. A place the Shadow Dragon that governs over darkness -Futz- has created. It isn\u2019t a labyrinth that was created naturally, but a honest-to-word labyrinth.\u201d (Sairitz)</p><br/><p>The labyrinth being big was bad news, but learning that the main cause of the place\u2019s name was actually a Superior Dragon is good news.</p><br/><p>What. It wasn\u2019t that it was connected to hell or that it had something to do with the Goddess, but just about a Superior Dragon.</p><br/><p>Then there\u2019s no need to worry.</p><br/><p>I honestly think that it is a pain to go 20 floors down, but if it\u2019s that kind of dungeon, there should be things like shortcuts and those kind of stuff.</p><br/><p>It is the country that\u2019s the most related to Japan after all!</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. So that\u2019s how it is. Understood. Sairitz-sama, thank you for the information. I will take it into consideration with a positive outlook. And so, I want to meet you before long.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>\u201cI am happy to hear that answer. In around a few days I will be able to give you the promissory note. I will contact you once again via the guild.\u201d (Sairitz)</p><br/><p>A mercenary group that seems to be living at the 20th floor of a giant dungeon.</p><br/><p>It is certainly good information.</p><br/><p>I will talk with Rembrandt-san about this and gather information about them.</p><br/><p>And if there\u2019s no problem, I will try meeting them.</p><br/><p>If possible, I want them to become the shield that protects this town.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d (Sairitz)</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, I just thought of something. Well then, I will be taking my leave, Sairitz-sama.\u201d (Makoto)</p><br/><p>I bow and leave the room.</p><br/><p>And then, I turn my thoughts towards the reason why I let out my voice.</p><br/><p>Which follower should I bring with me?</p><br/><p>It is not a task that has to be done by today, but I feel like there will be an intense battle royal occurring in Asora once again.</p><br/><p>Since it is Lorel, Tomoe is going to be persistent.</p><br/><p>A Superior Dragon might be appearing in this matter, so I feel like Tomoe is the better choice, but I don\u2019t think we will be able to have leisure time there.</p><br/><p>With the matter of the birth of hot springs, Tomoe\u2019s interest in Lorel has dimmed slightly compared to the past.</p><br/><p>Now then\u2026I pray that this matter somehow resolves in a calm and peaceful manner.</p><br/><p>It will probably be a wish that won\u2019t become true.</p><br/><p>For now, I decide to just go to Rembrandt-san\u2019s place to give him the report.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

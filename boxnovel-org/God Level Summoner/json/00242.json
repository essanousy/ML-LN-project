There weren\u2019t many people who responded. Obviously most people hadn\u2019t logged into their Q account yet.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng saw him working diligently and walked over. \u201cIs it hard being the captain?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Li Cangyu smiled. \u201cThese small things are nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want me to share some of it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, help me sort out the contents of tomorrow\u2019s meeting.\u201d Li Cangyu handed over a stack of information. \u201cI will start training in groups tomorrow. I have drawn up a preliminary training plan. Look at it and mark any places that need to be modified. We will discuss and finalize it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d Ling Xuefeng moved a chair and sat next to him.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng\u2019s efficiency was very high. He made several suggestions for revisions in just 10 minutes. He had Li Cangyu look at it and after thinking for a while, Li Cangyu felt the revisions were reasonable. He nodded in agreement.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you going to take a bath?\u201d Ling Xuefeng glanced at the time. \u201cThere is still an hour until dinner.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I will come back at night and take a bath. I still have some things to sort out here.\u201d Li Cangyu\u2019s eyes were still on the computer. \u201cYou can go first if you want to take a bath.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng saw his serious working face and thought that Li Cangyu was particularly handsome.</p><br/><p>The captain of the national team was really responsible. The training started tomorrow and many players were relaxing tonight. However, Li Cangyu couldn\u2019t do that. The training program had to be settled as soon as possible and the map proposal sent by the chairman also needed to be discussed and confirmed.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t work too hard.\u201d Ling Xuefeng gently touched Li Cangyu\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou spent the morning flying and then the afternoon on the bus. Take a bath first to relax. After dinner, I will help you sort through them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu couldn\u2019t help smiling. \u201cWill you also take a bath?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Ling Xuefeng glanced at the bathtub and said, \u201cThis hotel bathtub is really big. According to the size of our bodies, we can crowd together. Do you want to share a bath or take one alone\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu saw Ling Xuefeng say these provocative words with his usual abstinent expression. Suddenly, he stood up and hugged Ling Xuefeng. \u201cI want to bathe with you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The straightforward action made Ling Xuefeng forcible suppress his urge to kiss the other person. Ling Xuefeng patted Li Cangyu\u2019s shoulder and spoke in a hoarse voice, \u201cThen I will go fill up the water.\u201d</p><br/><p>Both of them were resolute types. As Ling Xuefeng filled up the water, Li Cangyu quickly pulled out a change of clothes, not hiding the expectation on his face.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng couldn\u2019t help smiling as they headed towards the bathroom together.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The two people first briefly rinsed before sitting in the bathtub.</p><br/><p>Both of them were over 1.8 meters tall so it was slightly crowded when they sat side by side. Their legs touched but Li Cangyu didn\u2019t mind. Instead, he placed his legs over Ling Xuefeng\u2019s legs and laughed. \u201cIt is strange to take a bath with someone else for the first time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng gazed at him with deep eyes and pinched his waist. \u201cYou will adapt after a few more times.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was ticklish after being pinched and moved away. He glanced into Ling Xuefeng\u2019s eyes and couldn\u2019t help leaning over to lightly kiss the other person. \u201cDuring these days of training, we will bathe together every day.\u201d</p><br/><p>He let go of Ling Xuefeng after he finished but the latter obviously wasn\u2019t satisfied. The back of Li Cangyu\u2019s head was held and he was deeply kissed.</p><br/><p>The two men had been leading their team in the competition for over a month. Whenever they met, it was with the identity of an opponent. They hadn\u2019t had such close contact in a long time.</p><br/><p>The kiss instantly ignited the flames inside them and the kiss became more intense.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng\u2019s kiss was overbearing and strong. Li Cangyu was also enthusiastic and straightforward. The temperature of the bathroom slowly increased. Once they were breathless, they reluctantly let go of each other.</p><br/><p>Their intense heartbeats echoed in their ears and both of them had the feeling of \u2018I\u2019m really lucky to fall in love with him\u2019.</p><br/><p>To be able to meet a lover who knew him and could stand side by side with him in the vast sea of people, wasn\u2019t this great luck?</p><br/><p>After the short exchange, Ling Xuefeng\u2019s lips curved as he extended his arm and let Li Cangyu rest on his shoulder. He said softly, \u201cIt has been a tiring day. Bathe a bit longer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Li Cangyu sat with him in the bath, playing with his slender fingers.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng\u2019s hands were very beautiful. Every finger was like the creator had carefully crafted them. The bones were distinct and clearly very powerful.</p><br/><p>They were the pair of hands that could move at extremely high speeds to destroy the gods of countless teams.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour hands are really beautiful.\u201d Li Cangyu praised. \u201cThese hands are priceless treasures and must be well protected. I can\u2019t wait for you to use these hands to abuse the world\u2019s top players.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng grabbed his fingers and replied, \u201cYou are the same.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled happily. \u201cWe are actually a good match!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng asked, \u201cYou only found out now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu faked a sad expression. \u201cYes, I found out a bit late. If I knew, I would\u2019ve caught you when I was 18 years old.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng gently touched Li Cangyu\u2019s hair. \u201cIt isn\u2019t too late.\u201d</p><br/><p>Anyone else who dared to touch Li Cangyu\u2019s head would be greeted with a fist to their face. However, Ling Xuefeng was different. The touch was filled with great affection. Li Cangyu rubbed Ling Xuefeng\u2019s shoulders and said, \u201cI will wash your hair for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Ling Xuefeng lowered his arms and sat down in the bathtub.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu immediately rose to his knees, took the shampoo from the rack, poured it into his hands and carefully applied it onto the other person\u2019s hair.</p><br/><p>Compared to the super-hand speed used to kill opponents on the field, his fingers movements were slightly clumsy. It was obviously his first time doing this but he was very serious.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng\u2019s heart softened and he gently hugged Li Cangyu\u2019s waist.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu\u2019s body was actually well-proportioned. It wasn\u2019t too fat or too thin, he had a long pair of legs and his body\u2019s curvature was very beautiful. Ling Xuefeng held him and didn\u2019t want to let go.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was hugged and Ling Xuefeng\u2019s hair touched his face. He spoke with dissatisfaction, \u201cDon\u2019t make trouble. I haven\u2019t finished washing your hair yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he continued washing Ling Xuefeng\u2019s hair. Ling Xuefeng had to close his eyes and wait for it to be done.</p><br/><p>A man\u2019s hair was short and could be washed quickly. After taking care of all the hair, Li Cangyu grabbed the nozzle and washed off the shampoo. Ling Xuefeng couldn\u2019t help thinking that if he hadn\u2019t bent Li Cangyu then Li Cangyu would be a super good husband for a woman.</p><br/><p>Now such a good person was monopolized by him alone.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng\u2019s lips curved and he made Li Cangyu sit back down in the bathtub. \u201cI will also help you wash your hair.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was very happy. \u201cGood!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two people washed each other\u2019s hair and exchanged loving smiles.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu felt that if it continued like this, he would probably shoot his load. He had to train tomorrow and couldn\u2019t let the players see\u2026 as he thought this, he jumped out of the bathtub and rubbed his body with a towel. Then he said simply, \u201cTime is almost up. Let\u2019s go to dinner first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng hadn\u2019t gotten up yet. Li Cangyu looked back and saw Ling Xuefeng\u2019s soft face under the lights. He couldn\u2019t help kissing the other person\u2019s forehead. \u201cI gave you a kiss. Now it is time to get out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He really liked this straightforward and enthusiastic person!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

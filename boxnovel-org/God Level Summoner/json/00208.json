He aimed at the position where the assassin was standing and unceremoniously had this thunder spirit attack.</p><br/><p>\u2014Thunder\u2019s Wrath!</p><br/><p>There was a loud bang and a purple thunderbolt descended from the sky. In addition to the exposed assassin, the teammate beside him were also hit. Two assassins of the Ghost Spirits team immediately lost 20% of their blood!</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong and Zhang Jueming followed their captain\u2019s rhythm. Once they saw Cat God act, Zhang Jueming didn\u2019t hesitate to use the white magician\u2019s auxiliary big move while Xie Shurong teleported to the two people and used Light and Shadow Rotation!</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang also dealt some output damage. Trap Blast!</p><br/><p>The big moves came one after another, the speed too fast. In just three seconds, various skills and light effects overlapped, causing the dark map to become bright. The two assassins of Ghost Spirits didn\u2019t have any time to output before they were directly hit by the Canglan team!</p><br/><p>[Ah Shu has killed Flowing Moon, first kill!]</p><br/><p>[Ah Shu has killed Quicksand, second kill!]</p><br/><p>These assassins were newcomers raised by Lou Wushuang in the sixth season. After the sixth and seventh seasons, the two of them had become a highly familiar assassin combo along with the Lou Zhang brothers. They formed the assassination lineup of the Ghost Spirits team.</p><br/><p>However, the two people were unlucky today. One step in Zhuo Hang\u2019s traps caused them to instantly be killed.</p><br/><p>\u201cBeautiful! Kou Hongyi couldn\u2019t help cheering. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect the team\u2019s ability to set fire to be so strong. Once Zhuo Hang\u2019s trap was triggered, Cat God, Ah Shu and Old Zhang combined to kill them and the skills were so fast that is was dizzying!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Bing also sighed. \u201cIt seems that sending Zhuo Hang in today\u2019s team battle was a bold move for Cat God but it was effective. The hunter\u2019s traps caused big trouble to the assassins of Ghost Spirits.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was a bit unexpected for Lou Wushuang and he frowned slightly.</p><br/><p>Before the game, he tried to guess Li Cangyu\u2019s formation and thought that Xiao Han was most likely to play in the team battles. He didn\u2019t expect Zhuo Hang who rarely appeared in the team battles to actually participate in this one.</p><br/><p>The even more unexpected thing was that Zhuo Hang\u2019s speed was extremely fast. It was almost comparable to the winner of the sixth season\u2019s rookie award, Chen Anran.</p><br/><p>The most terrible thing about hunters was their ability to quickly set up traps to suppress the opponents. If they could arrange traps in combination with the terrain then it would be hard for the opponents to move!</p><br/><p>Today, Zhuo Hang could do both these things. He didn\u2019t just move like the wind but his trap layout was extremely sturdy. It was just against the black stone pillars where an assassin had been hiding. The assassin stepped forward and accidentally triggered Zhuo Hang\u2019s trap!</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t a coincidence but Zhuo Hang\u2019s precise grasp of the terrain.</p><br/><p>The two people killed by Canglan were obviously annoyed. They looked at each other and reluctantly waited for their resurrection.</p><br/><p>Captain Lou Wushuang was very quiet. He gave Zhang Shaohui a signal on the map. Zhang Shaohui immediately followed him to the front of the Canglan team.</p><br/><p>The audience felt a bit nervous. From their perspective, the Lou Zhang brothers were standing opposite Li Cangyu at this time. However, they were both invisible so Li Cangyu didn\u2019t notice there were two terrible assassins in front of him.</p><br/><p>The Lou Zhang brothers took advantage of this opportunity to act at the same time.</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui used Pain Blade to stun Li Cangyu while Lou Wushuang controlled the healer Bai Xuan. Then both of them attacked Li Cangyu while cooperating with the blood kin sacrifice. Li Cangyu\u2019s blood immediately fell to 10% residual blood!</p><br/><p>Cat God\u2019s blood gauge was flashing red and the milk dad Bai Xuan was fainted and unable to add blood. After seeing that Li Cangyu was going to die in seconds, Gu Siming rushed to the captain\u2019s side and decisively opened Guardian\u2019s Power!</p><br/><p>A golden light shone on the body of the elf summoner. This was the paladin\u2019s skill that protected the designated target. Gu Siming placed the shield on his captain and Lou Wushuang and Zhang Shaohui\u2019s most critical attack skills were transferred to Gu Siming.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu saw this and felt gratified. He didn\u2019t exact Xiao Gu\u2019s reaction to be so fast and he actually knew to run back to protect the captain at a key moment\u2026</p><br/><p>The thing that made Li Cangyu especially happy was that the Lou Zhang brothers failed to kill him and wanted to retreat, only to be set in place by Ah Shu\u2019s Spirit Lock!</p><br/><p>Wanting to kill their captain, it wasn\u2019t so easy to leave!</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong wasn\u2019t a herbivore. He just killed two assassins and was in an excited state. He turned back and hit Lou Wushuang with a set of combos, causing Lou Wushuang\u2019s blood to fall to 50%. Lou Wushuang was forced to open Combat Stealth to rapidly retreat and Zhang Shaohui naturally withdrew with him.</p><br/><p>This wave of the team battle ended with two assassins being killed and the Lou Zhang brothers reluctantly retreating.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>In the commentators\u2019 room, Kou Hongyi exclaimed, \u201cGhost Spirits is suffering at home, this is rare!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Bing explained calmly, \u201cWe can\u2019t blame them. The two assassins of Ghost Spirits obviously didn\u2019t expect Zhuo Hang to set a trap nearby and accidentally triggered it, giving Cat God a chance to kill them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kou Hongyi said, \u201cGhost Spirits suffered a big loss in this wave and it will be difficult for them to make a comeback.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Bing agreed.</p><br/><p>The game wasn\u2019t over yet but many people already expected the ending. Xie Shurong had two heads and after Ghost Spirits retreated, the Canglan team quickly won the ice dragon\u2019s economic bonus. Gaining the ice dragon was such a big advantage that it was almost impossible for the Ghost Spirits to reverse the situation.</p><br/><p>Unless Li Cangyu lost his IQ at a critical moment\u2026 but this probability was infinitely close to 0%.</p><br/><p>Cat God\u2019s IQ was online for a long time, especially during a match. Cat God\u2019s head worked quickly and he was always stable when he had an advantage. Moreover, Ah Shu\u2019s attack bonus from the double kills was enough to make the Ghost Spirits\u2019 assassins nervous. It wouldn\u2019t be easy for the assassins to kill Old Cat in one breath.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Sure enough, it was as Kou Hongyi and Yu Bing expected. After the defeat in the first wave of combat, Ghost Spirits found it more and more difficult to play.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu had a habit when commanding games. He would play very hard when in the disadvantageous position, letting the opponent accidentally make a mistake and then seizing this opportunity to reverse the game. However, he was particularly stable in the advantageous position. He was as stable as a mountain and didn\u2019t move. The enter Canglan team was like an unbreakable wall that didn\u2019t give the opponent a chance to counterattack.</p><br/><p>The first wave of combat fattened up Xie Shurong and he became a very sharp swordsman. His hand speed plus the equipment bonuses made his big moves the same as cutting vegetables.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Zhuo Hang and Li Cangyu were the typically fast attackers. Thanks to Old Zhang doubling their attack at key moments, the attack power of the three people far exceeded the four assassins of Ghost Spirits.</p><br/><p>Once the two sides met again in the lower middle road, Ghost Spirits fought Canglan and lost, sending another two heads.</p><br/><p>At this point, Ghost Spirits completely lost any chance of turning things around. The Canglan team pushed through through the defense towers and directly crushed the central crystal!</p><br/><p>The result stunned the audience. After all, Ghost Spirits\u2019 home games were notoriously difficult to deal with. In the regular season, Ghost Spirits eliminated many strong teams at home, including Canglan!</p><br/><p>Today, Ghost Spirits\u2019 assassin pair were killed by a newcomer, making it difficult for the Ghost Spirits fans to accept.</p><br/><p>Canglan fans were very pleased. They won the first game, which was extremely beneficial to the morale of the team. It was a good start to the playoffs.</p><br/><p>The score on the big screen became 1:0. Li Cangyu smiled and brought the players together to prepare for the next game.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>In the VIP seats, Qin Mo commented, \u201cI think that Gu Siming and Zhuo Hang are performing very well today. Their reaction rates are much faster than the regular season.\u201d</p><br/><p>Vice-Captain Yan Ruiwen smiled. \u201cThis is the process of quantitative change to achieve qualitative change. Xiao Gu is a player from the Dragon Song training camp. His foundation is very solid but his awareness wasn\u2019t enough in the regular season, especially when it came to protecting teammates. During this period of time, Cat God should\u2019ve designed targeted training for him. He isn\u2019t stupid so it isn\u2019t surprising that he can keep up with the pace of the team.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mo nodded in agreement. \u201cYes, just now, if he hadn\u2019t come back in time to throw the shield on Cat God then Cat God would\u2019ve probably died. Once Cat God dies, Xie Shurong would have to face the Lou Zhang brothers and might not be able to fight. The ones to collapse would be Canglan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Guo Xuan interjected. \u201cI think Zhuo Hang has made very fast progress. I watched the last match between Canglan and Cheetah and he didn\u2019t have too much of an advantage against Chen Anran, vice-captain of Cheetah. However, based on today\u2019s performance, he has learned from Chen Anran. He blended his own style with what he learn, combining his effective hand speed with the terrain.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe most difficult thing for a hunter is to grasp the terrain. Zhuo Hang\u2019s level has improved a lot\u2026\u201d Qin Mo scratched his head and asked doubtfully, \u201cThe newcomers of Canglan seem to have hormones injected in them today. How can they improve so much?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Ruiwen touched his chin and thought for a moment. \u201cPerhaps this was Cat God\u2019s targeted training during the week. They aren\u2019t stupid and also have the long accumulation of experience in the seventh season. Perhaps that\u2019s why they seem better today than usual?\u201d</p><br/><p>After discussing it for a while, Yan Ruiwen found that Ling Xuefeng was silent. Yan Ruiwen couldn\u2019t help looking over and asking, \u201cCaptain Ling, what do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng only said one thing. \u201cWe have to prepare for the next battle with Canglan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone knelt down!</p><br/><p>The captain\u2019s words were really domineering. The match wasn\u2019t over yet he was so sure that Canglan would advance?</p><br/><p>Still, no one could refute him when they saw Ling Xuefeng\u2019s cold but firm eyes. They could only think in their heart, \u2018Your confidence in Cat God is really unparalleled. Only the first game is finished yet you directly confirmed that Canglan will win! Is this an opponent or true love?\u2019</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Ling Xuefeng was in a good mood so he took everyone to a nearby restaurant and ordered sumptuous dishes. He boldly used the team funds to buy the meal.</p><br/><p>At Wind Colour team parties, Ling Xuefeng didn\u2019t like to speak but Vice-Captain Yan Ruiwen was very active. The main players Guo Xuan and Xu Feifan were also lively. Everyone chatted together and the atmosphere was very relaxed.</p><br/><p>However, today\u2019s situation was somewhat wrong. It was because Qin Mo was pale from beginning to end, like a sky about to collapse.</p><br/><p>The full blood Qin Mo had been completely suppressed by Tan Shitian and killed. It was estimated that the shock the rookie who just debuted experienced was too big and his emotions hadn\u2019t adjusted.</p><br/><p>A few old players were afraid of his sadness and took the initiative to give him some dishes, which he accepted with an embarrassed expression.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng still hadn\u2019t given an evaluation on Qin Mo\u2019s performance. He knew that his disciple\u2019s self-esteem was very high. At this time, Qin Mo would be psychologically damaged no matter what his master said. Therefore, it was best to let Qin Mo think about it himself.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>After dinner, everyone headed back to the hotel by car. The game time was in the morning and Wind Colour\u2019s leader had booked an afternoon flight back to Shanghai. Ling Xuefeng asked everyone to take a nap first before meeting in the hall at two in the afternoon.</p><br/><p>Everyone went back to their room to rest. Qin Mo was staying with Xu Feifan, a blood kin summoner. This was Ling Xuefeng\u2019s arrangement since he thought two players of the same class could exchange experience.</p><br/><p>Normally Qin Mo would take the initiative to consult with his predecessor when he encountered problems. Today, he headed straight to the bathroom as soon as he entered the room.</p><br/><p>Xu Feifan had been planning to go to sleep when he received a text message from Captain Ling. [Qin Mo seems to be worrying about something. Speak to him and see if you can figure out what caused him to play abnormally.]</p><br/><p>[I understand.] Xu Feifan accepted the task and started to frown.</p><br/><p>Qin Mo took a shower and came out a while later. The young boy was only 16 this year and his body hadn\u2019t yet developed. The skinny boy was pale and looked very depressed. This guy\u2019s heart was too proud and he thought he was great just because he was Ling Xuefeng\u2019s apprentice. Xu Feifan had long thought Qin Mo would fall, he just didn\u2019t expect it to be in such a ruthless manner.</p><br/><p>He was abused in the ring in front of so many people. A young player could easily receive psychological shadows and even lost confidence. Competitive games were always cruel. If a person didn\u2019t get up after being beaten, there would be countless players stepping on their back.</p><br/><p>Xu Feifan was aware of the seriousness of the problem and pondered for a moment. He looked back and found that after taking the shadow, Qin Mo was already going to sleep.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Xu Feifan was torn for a moment before going to Qin Mo\u2019s bedside and whispering, \u201cXiao Qin, are you sleeping?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The little boy\u2019s stuffy voice came from the quilt.</p><br/><p>Xu Feifan coughed two times to clear his throat before saying, \u201cI am a player who debuted in the third season. You should know that before me, the best blood kin summoner in the league was Yuan Shaozhe, the former Vice-Captain of Wind Colour. After Vice-Captain Yuan retired, I started to play with Captain Ling.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard about it.\u201d Qin Mo replied softly.</p><br/><p>He knew that the former vice-captain, Yuan Shaozhe was three years older than Ling Xuefeng and retired earlier. He had never seen that person but he heard that Xu Feifan, the current main blood kin summoner, had inherited his style of play.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom the beginning, the core of our Wind Colour team is the control of the double summoners. You should already know that your master is one of the best in the world. However, Captain Ling isn\u2019t young and he will retire someday.\u201d Xu Feifan paused and his voice became gentler. \u201cHe accepted you as a disciple, had me teach you the blood kin summoner\u2019s gameplay and also makes you watch videos about blood kin summoners. Do you know the reason for this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mo was startled while a strong bitterness filled his heart.</p><br/><p>Yes, he knew.</p><br/><p>Captain Ling was doing this for the future of Wind Colour, so he could train successors for the Wind Colour team.</p><br/><p>As Captain Ling\u2019s apprentice, Qin Mo received more opportunities than his peers since he debuted. Captain Ling wasn\u2019t stingy about letting him play in less important games and even when meeting a strong team like Time, his master put pressure on him by placing him in the key \u2018guard\u2019 position\u2026</p><br/><p>Then what did Qin Mo do?</p><br/><p>He was in a daze during the game\u2026</p><br/><p>He was full of blood when facing Tan Shitian but he was sent off without causing Tan Shitian\u2019s blood to drop at all.</p><br/><p>He completely betrayed his master\u2019s trust and felt sorry for his master\u2019s efforts in teaching in.</p><br/><p>Qin Mo\u2019s pain twisted when he thought this and he wrapped himself tighter in his quilt, his eyes becoming red. It was like a faucet was opened as tears that he could no longer control flowed out.</p><br/><p>Xu Feifan saw the little boy wrapped in the quilt and knew he must be crying. After all, Qin Mo was only 16 years old and still hadn\u2019t grown up. It was impossible to ask him to be calm after being abused by an experienced player.</p><br/><p>The fact that he was crying about today\u2019s situation was a good thing.</p><br/><p>Xu Feifan sighed and patted Qin Mo over the quilt. \u201cXiao Qin, Captain Ling is actually very good to you. He rarely expresses concern but everything he has done is to make you as strong as possible. You lost today\u2019s arena match but it doesn\u2019t matter. He sent you to gain experience from Tan Shitian, not to win. Do you understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mo was stunned and emerged from the quilt to look at Xu Feifan.</p><br/><p>Not to win? It was to gain experience?</p><br/><p>Xu Feifan\u2019s words were like cold water, immediately waking Qin Mo up.</p><br/><p>Yes, he was a rookie player and would find it hard to win against Tan Shitian, the captain of the Time team. Master should\u2019ve guessed this result and sent him to fact Tan Shitian to gain experience from an expert.</p><br/><p>In fact, taking the game seriously and playing at his own level would be enough. However, he only wanted to win and his brain was messy. The result was that he was abused and completely wasted this rare opportunity.</p><br/><p>It could be said that Wind Colour lost three points for nothing\u2026</p><br/><p>Xu Feifan say the boy\u2019s repentant expression and couldn\u2019t help patting Qin Mo\u2019s shoulder. \u201cCaptain Ling doesn\u2019t care about the score. He is more concerned about why you were playing abnormally. Xiao Qin, look back and think about it. I feel\u2026 you should take the initiative to give your master an explanation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mo thought for a long time before nodding hard. \u201cThank you Brother Xu. I will talk to Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen have a good sleep. Once we return to Shanghai in the afternoon, you can go find the captain.\u201d Xu Feifan had pondered on his lines, opened the big brother\u2019s warm education mode and finally succeeded in persuading Qin Mo. He fell asleep in a happy mood.</p><br/><p>Qin Mo\u2019s head was in chaos and he didn\u2019t sleep. He was thinking about how to explain the matter with Love to Eat Braised Fish.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>At four in the afternoon, the Wind Colour collectively returned to Shanghai.</p><br/><p>The Wind Colour Club was one of the earliest clubs established in the Miracle League and its popularity was very high. In its home city of Shanghai, there were numerous loyal fans.</p><br/><p>In order to avoid the e-sports reporters waiting like rabbits at the airport, everyone walked down to the parking lot under the leadership of Ling Xuefeng and were sent back in a car that picked them up.</p><br/><p>Upon arriving at the club, Ling Xuefeng said to the players, \u201cStarting tomorrow, it is a holiday in the league. Those who want to go out to relax or go home to visit their loved ones should tell Vice-Captain Yan. Just remember to return before the 17th.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a rare holiday and Ling Xuefeng didn\u2019t want to make everyone train. At present, Wind Colour was ranked first in the team standings. As long as there wasn\u2019t a drop in the second round of the regular season, this year\u2019s playoffs definitely wouldn\u2019t be a problem.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d It was clear that everyone was happy about the captain\u2019s decision.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng made arrangements for the team\u2019s holiday and then returned to his dorm. He put away his luggage and turned on the computer in the living room.</p><br/><p>He was watching a video replay of the match between Wind Colour and Time when a knock was heard and Qin spoke in a weak voice.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng got up and opened the door. He saw Qin Mo whisper with a bowed head, \u201cMaster\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Ling Xuefeng looked at him lightly. \u201cDid you find me to say something?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mo nodded and organized his words. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Master. My mind was very messy today and I didn\u2019t play well.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize. Tell me why you didn\u2019t play well.\u201d Ling Xuefeng ordered.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 it is like this. Yesterday, the president of the Wind Colour Guild told me that their six member team was killed by a three member team in the game. I was curious and went online to look. The result was I met a very strong elf summoner. I didn\u2019t beat him and was even taught by him\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Qin Mo\u2019s heart felt very wronged when he thought about this and his voice couldn\u2019t help choking up. \u201cHe said I lost because I was too careless and that I shouldn\u2019t summon too many pets. It would just put me at a disadvantage. I.. I thought he had a point. I was thinking about it last night and my spirit wasn\u2019t good in the morning. My mind was dazed and I didn\u2019t know what to do in the game.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng waited for him to finish before seizing the key point. \u201cYou said an elf summoner?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Qin Mo nodded. \u201cHe is very powerful. I have never met an elf summoner and didn\u2019t know how to play against him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is his name?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLove to Eat Braised Fish.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Ling Xuefeng was silent for a moment before leaving the room. \u201cYou should\u2019ve told me earlier.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster!\u201d Qin Mo quickly followed him. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am going to the guild.\u201d Ling Xuefeng said calmly.</p><hr/><br/><p>You can also join my discord channel to chat with fellow readers about the novels;</p><br/>\n</div>"}

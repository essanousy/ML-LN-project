Li Cangyu switched to an e-sports channel and happened to see a replay of the Canglan VS Wind Colour match.</p><br/><p>The moment he met with Ling Xuefeng, they threw big moves towards each other. The Elf\u2019s Cataclysm and Demon God\u2019s Rage opened and the same time, creating a rare splendid scene from the perspective of the onlookers.</p><br/><p>In addition to the game on the big screen, there were two windows that showed the close-up expressions of both players. Ling Xuefeng\u2019s face was very serious when making a big move. His handsome and cold side profile was like a god.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu looked over at him and couldn\u2019t help gently kissing his ear. \u201cYour serious look when playing the game is really handsome.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng was taken in by him and had itchy ears. His heart was swaying because Li Cangyu was really deadly when he took the initiative. He was straightforward and seductive. If Ling Xuefeng\u2019s self-control wasn\u2019t amazing then he would directly overpower Li Cangyu on the sofa.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu kissed the other person before sitting back, staring at the screen with a thoughtful expression.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng pulled Li Cangyu into his arms and kissed him on the forehead, asking, \u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour apprentice has grown quickly. He is calm when playing the game and has lost his conceited problem from the past. His progress this season is obvious and he has potential to be a great god.\u201d Li Cangyu saw Qin Mo manipulating his pets to chase Xiao Han and seriously evaluated, \u201cIn the next few years, he will become a top master of the new generation of the Miracle League.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng glanced back at the TV screen and saw Qin Mo\u2019s outstanding performance. \u201cHe has to grow up a bit fast or I won\u2019t feel reassured leaving the Wind Colour team to him after I retire.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was a bit surprised. \u201cYou want to hand the captain\u2019s position over to Qin Mo? What about Yan Ruiwen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYan Ruiwen is very good at taking care of the team\u2019s internal matters and is more suitable to being vice-captain. I want Qin Mo to be the captain.\u201d Ling Xuefeng paused before adding, \u201cQin Mo\u2019s personality is a bit arrogant but he has matured in this season. I hope that he can take on the captain\u2019s responsibilities in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, Xiao Qin is suitable to be a captain. He is much better than my family\u2019s Xiao Han.\u201d Li Cangyu sighed. \u201cXiao Han loves to use strange words. I previously thought about handing over Canglan to him but his Chinese is really a headache. If there is a captain who talks nonsense in the interview then won\u2019t the post-match interview become a joke?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng couldn\u2019t help smiling as he thought of Xiao Han\u2019s \u2018really very good\u2019 that spread on Weibo. \u201cXiao Han\u2019s thinking is really different from ordinary people but that is also his feature. There is no need to force him to change. For the captain\u2019s position, you can observe for a while and hand it over to Xie Shurong first?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s true. Ah Shu is currently 21 years old and can still play for two or three more years. If he is still in the league when I retire then I can hand the captain\u2019s position of Canglan to him first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Originally, the word \u2018retirement\u2019 was very sad for e-sports competitors. However, these two people didn\u2019t feel sad when discussing the topic of retirement. They focused on their disciples Qin Mo and Xiao Han and it was more like a husband and wife discussing the future of their children. It was a different type of warmth.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu suddenly turned around and stared at Ling Xuefeng. \u201cWhen are you going to retire?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng thought for a moment before replying, \u201cPerhaps at the end of this season.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu said, \u201cI might also retire at that time. Then we can do it together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng smiled and pressed a gentle kiss against Li Cangyu\u2019s lips.</p><br/><p>The kiss was as light as a feather. Afterwards, Ling Xuefeng stared into Li Cangyu\u2019s eyes and whispered, \u201cI haven\u2019t retired because I was waiting for you to come back.\u201d</p><br/><p>In an instant, Li Cangyu felt that the softest place at the bottom of his heart was touched.</p><br/><p>He took the initiative to hug Ling Xuefeng and declared seriously, \u201cFortunately, I\u2019m back and this time we will be together.\u201d</p><br/><p>They would experience the new seventh season together and also create the glory of the summoner!</p><br/><p>The intimate embrace joined the two people\u2019s hearts together, as if their souls were close. Li Cangyu had never experienced this feeling of connecting with a human heart before but there was always such a connection when he was with Ling Xuefeng. Ling Xuefeng was a cold person but his arms always made Li Cangyu feel particularly warm.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>That night, they finished watching the match and Li Cangyu consciously ran to Ling Xuefeng\u2019s bed. By the time Ling Xuefeng finished his shower, this guy had actually fallen asleep.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng saw his sleeping appearance and smiled before laying down on the bed.</p><br/><p>The sleeping Li Cangyu felt the familiar warmth and couldn\u2019t help entering Ling Xuefeng\u2019s arms. This action was really like a comfortably sleeping cat.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng\u2019s heart was soft as he gently reached out and hugged Li Cangyu.</p><br/><p>When he woke up the next morning, Li Cangyu found that he was in Ling Xuefeng\u2019s arms. Their hands and feet were tangled together and this posture was very shameless. Li Cangyu didn\u2019t feel embarrassed and instead kissed Ling Xuefeng\u2019s forehead, saying, \u201cMorning!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng touched his smooth shoulder and said, \u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu looked down and saw Ling Xuefeng\u2019s chest muscles.</p><br/><p>The sturdy but unobtrusive chest muscles were perfectly displayed in front of him. Li Cangyu couldn\u2019t help stretching out a hand and touching them. He moved along the chest muscles to the firm abs. Li Cangyu couldn\u2019t help sighing, \u201cYou are usually wrapped up in a suit. I didn\u2019t expect you to look like this after taking off your clothes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng became stiff all over and immediately grabbed Li Cangyu\u2019s hand, whispering, \u201cDon\u2019t make trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice was hoarse and subdued.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu noticed the reaction of Ling Xuefeng\u2019s body and immediately let go like it was a hot potato. He smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to take a shower.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he ran to the bathroom in front of Ling Xuefeng\u2019s hot eyes.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu took a shower while his mind was full of Ling Xuefeng. The body that was comparable to a model, the handsome looks, the deep eyes, the sexy voice\u2026</p><br/><p>It was terrible to experience such a big fire in the morning!</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu really liked the other person but didn\u2019t want to go further with Ling Xuefeng at the moment. In fact, his ideas were more traditional. Before he liked Ling Xuefeng, Li Cangyu always thought he would marry a gentle woman in the future. He wouldn\u2019t casually take possession of his lover\u2019s body before they were engaged because he thought it was irresponsible.</p><br/><p>Now that the target had been replaced by a man, Li Cangyu was a bit dazed.</p><br/><p>What could he do with a man?</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng\u2019s personality was cold and strong. Li Cangyu naturally knew this, although the man would show a rare gentle side in front of him. Still, Li Cangyu couldn\u2019t imagine how he could overwhelm and eat Ling Xuefeng.</p><br/><p>The picture was very exciting but\u2026 was it painful? What if he hurt Ling Xuefeng?</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu felt that if he accidentally hurt Ling Xuefeng, he would definitely be drowned by the Wind Colour fans!</p><br/><p>Thus, before he was completely prepared, he didn\u2019t want to progress his relationship with Ling Xuefeng any further. He could only think about it in his mind.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was unaware that Ling Xuefeng was taking a shower in another bathroom.</p><br/><p>The house he bought had two bathrooms. One with just a shower and the other with a large bathtub. Li Cangyu occupied the room with a large bathtub so Ling Xuefeng had to go to the other one to chill his body\u2019s reaction with cold water.</p><br/><p>He knew Li Cangyu\u2019s concerns and wasn\u2019t in a hurry.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was already his lover so it was best to let it develop naturally.</p><br/><p>The two people took care of the problem in the bathroom. Both their expressions were calm when they returned to the dining room. As captains, their ability to regulate their emotions was first-class.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng prepared milk and bread and finished eating breakfast with Li Cangyu. He asked, \u201cDo you want to rest at home or go out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu thought for a moment before replying, \u201cIt is boring staying at home every day. What is a fun place around here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng suggested, \u201cDo you want to go and play ball?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu questioned, \u201cBasketball?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng nodded. \u201cDo you want me to take you to play for the day?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu immediately agreed. \u201cOkay!\u201d</p><br/><p>He usually played games on the computer and the number of sports he played wasn\u2019t much. Apart from e-sports, Li Cangyu\u2019s favourite game was basketball. Ling Xuefeng\u2019s proposal was just right for him!</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng drove Li Cangyu to a basketball club. This was a fee-based basketball court and they could play privately as long as they have money. Ling Xuefeng was paying at the front desk when he suddenly heard a familiar voice behind him. \u201cI used to play basketball when I was abroad. I will definitely win against you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t this Xiao Han?</p><br/><p>The two of them turned back and saw Xiao Han and Qin Mo entering.</p><br/><p>The two little guys saw their masters and their expressions became dazed. It was quite cute.</p><br/><p>Qin Mo reacted first and took the initiative to walk over. \u201cMaster, Cat God, are you playing basketball as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng nodded lightly and asked, \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mo coughed. He looked back at Xiao Han before explaining, \u201cXiao Han didn\u2019t return to Changsha so I offered to take him around Shanghai to play for a few days. Yesterday, I took him to the playground and today he says that he wants to play basketball. That\u2019s why I took him here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The blood kin summoner Xu Feifan liked basketball a lot. Qin Mo was familiar with him and naturally knew this place. In fact, Ling Xuefeng knew this place because it was recommended to him by Xu Feifan. The result was that the masters and apprentices actually met here.</p><br/><p>This could be called fate!</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu saw the two teenages wearing sportswear like high school students and his interest was peaked. \u201cIt is just right that you came here. I\u2019m not interested in playing alone so it is better for the four of us to play together. The team that loses will buy lunch.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han scratched his head and said, \u201cMaster, I used to go and play with people when I was abroad. My level is very good. Can I join a team with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mo immediately objected. \u201cHow can that be? Everyone knows that Cat God is excellent in basketball. If the two of you team up then won\u2019t it be abusing me and my master?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng, who was dismissed by his apprentice, remained serious and didn\u2019t speak.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu said with a smile, \u201cThen how about I be with Xuefeng and the two of you team up? The masters against the apprentices, let\u2019s see who wins?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han wanted to protest but Ling Xuefeng immediately agreed. \u201cIt is decided.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

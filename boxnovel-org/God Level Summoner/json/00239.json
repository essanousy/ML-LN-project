His number of fans rose by more than 100,000 in just one day.</p><br/><p>There were many messages to cheer him on and also many saying \u2018Cat God is married to me.\u2019 Li Cangyu\u2019s personal charm was finally accepted and recognized. Compared with the doubts that came from all sides when he just returned to Miracle, the number of fans supporting him thoroughly crushed the sunspots.</p><br/><p>However, others deliberately found things to criticize. [The national team doesn\u2019t have a knight, hehe. The front row is weak and will definitely be blown away!]</p><br/><p>[South Korea has the angel summoner and the US has Jack. Li Cangyu and Ling Xuefeng will surely cry after being abused!]</p><br/><p>[Captain Tan, your small body is going to lose. Isn\u2019t the beautiful archer of the Japanese team better than you?]</p><br/><p>[Qin Mo, Zhuo Hang and Xiao Han can go to the National Competition? Is there no one else in our country?]</p><br/><p>[The crybaby Zhu Qingyue actually made it onto the national team. Don\u2019t cry at the World Competition and give the national team shame!]</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>These doubts were ignore. No matter how perfect a player was, there would always be people who didn\u2019t like them. If the professional players argued with them every day, their brains would bleed from anger.</p><br/><p>Three days passed very quickly. Everyone gathered at the hotel near Kunming Airport. Once they all arrived, Chairman Nan finally appeared with the vehicle to drive them to the secret base.</p><br/><p>It was a bus with more than 30 seats and was very spacious.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu and Ling Xuefeng tacitly sat on the last row. They looked at each other and secretly held hands. No one discovered that they were holding hands and expressing their feelings for each other.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan originally wanted to sit with Xiao Han. As a result, Xie Shurong grabbed the seat next to Bai Xuan and grinned. \u201cVice-Captain Bai, I haven\u2019t seen you for a long time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Bai Xuan looked out the window and wore his earplugs.</p><br/><p>Most of the other players were sitting together with people they knew. Some sit alone on two seat and slept.</p><br/><p>Perhaps they were too tired from the flight but the bus was quiet the whole way. After two hours, the bus finally stopped. A sleeping person woke up and looked out the window. Then his jaw dropped with surprise.</p><br/><p>Beautiful scenery, singing birds and a calm atmosphere!</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei excitedly stood up and accidentally hit the seat in front of him. He groaned from the pain and Tan Shitian rubbed his forehead, asking in a soft voice, \u201cAre you hurt? Why were you in such a hurry?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no pain, no pain.\u201d Cheng Wei waved his hand and actively spoke, \u201cChairman, what is this place?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is Anning.\u201d Chairman Nan smiled. \u201cIt is a city near Kunming and we are staying at a hot springs resort. The alliance has specifically booked 12 suites for the national team as well as a conference room as a temporary training base. For the next half-month, everyone will be training here. If you are tired then you can soak in the hot springs. Every room has a large bathtub which can be used freely.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA hot springs hotel!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChairman, you are really willing to spend money!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can soak in the hot springs tonight!\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a burst of exclamations in the bus.</p><br/><p>The league used its hard-earned capital this time. The hot springs\u2019 room rate for one night was quite high, not to mention the three meals a day. The price of the meeting room also wasn\u2019t cheap. Obviously, this was an allocation of funds from the sponsorship funds that Chairman Nan approved. Many brands were rushing to sponsor them for the World Competition and the national team could afford to spend the money.</p><br/><p>Of course, before the World Competition, it was understandable to pull out some players to endorse certain products.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to soak in the hot springs. I haven\u2019t been to a hot springs yet!\u201d Cheng Wei excitedly turned around and grabbed his luggage. Then the chairman added, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I ordered double rooms in the name of the league. Considering the fact that there are three females from Red Fox, the team reporter Zhao Yue will stay with one of them. You can rest assured that the reporter will only do some interviews when everyone is idle and shoot tidbits of you training. The fans will be pleased and it won\u2019t affect your training.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe remaining 19 players plus the photographer are 20 people. The captain can arrange how the rooms are allocated.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Li Cangyu nodded and took out a pen and paper. \u201cEveryone can freely choose if they want to stay with someone. If there are no special requirements then I will assign it casually.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui didn\u2019t hesitate to raise his hand. \u201cI will live with my brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d Li Cangyu wrote it down on the paper. \u201cIs there anyone else?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong pointed to the person sleeping next to him. \u201cI will live with Vice-Captain Bai.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan was wearing earplugs to sleep and didn\u2019t hear what everyone was saying. Thus, he ended up in Xie Shurong\u2019s territory.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will stay with Xiao Zhu.\u201d Chu Yan had to live with his crybaby apprentice Zhu Qingyue. Similarly, Yan Ruiwen and Guo Xuan of Wind Colour and Su Guangmo and Yu Pingsheng of Flying Feathers were fixed partners.</p><br/><p>There were three people selected from time. Cheng Wei raised his hand to say he would live with Lu Xiao. The result was that Tan Shitian grabbed his hand and said, \u201cI will live with Xiao Cheng.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei protested. \u201cNo, I will stay with Lu Xiao!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Xiao stared at his captain with a conflicted expression. Tan Shitian said, \u201cLu Xiao recently bought a SLR camera and wants to stay with the photographer to discuss techniques for taking photos. Don\u2019t mess around.\u201d</p><br/><p>The smart Lu Xiao immediately nodded. \u201cYes, that\u2019s right. The SLR camera is very complicated and I was looking for a professional to learn from.\u201d Then he ran to sit with the photographer Zhou Yang.</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei had no choice but to stay in Tan Shitian\u2019s room.</p><br/><p>Xiao Han should\u2019ve stayed with Zhuo Hang from the same team but Qin Mo successfully persuaded him on the grounds of \u2018I will teach you Chinese.\u2019 Thus, the two little princes became harmonious friends and roommates.</p><br/><p>The remaining Zhuo Hang stayed with Jiang Xu of the Cheetah team. Both of them were hunters and could exchange ideas with each other.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>After assigning the rooms, Cheng Wei suddenly had a thought. \u201cEh? Cat God, who are you living with?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone looked at him like he was a fool. \u2018Who taught you maths? Can\u2019t you count? The only one left is Captain Ling. Who else would Cat God be living with?\u2019</p><br/><p>People expressed sympathy for Cheng Wei\u2019s IQ.</p><br/><p>The silent Ling Xuefeng opened his mouth. \u201cHe is living with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sentence was calm and cold but Cheng Wei inexplicably got a chill down his spine. He suddenly felt that Captain Ling was claiming ownership?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

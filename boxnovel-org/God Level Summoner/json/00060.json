Waiting for the person you loved was a very wonderful experience. Ling Xuefeng sorted out his messy thoughts and looked down at his watch, tidying up the collar of his suit with slender fingers.</p><br/><p>He usually didn\u2019t wear this type of formal outfit when training in the team. But when he came to see Li Cangyu today, he dressed himself up, shaved his beard and wiped his shoes. Ling Xuefeng was filled with confidence but in front of his beloved, he still wanted to show his best self.</p><br/><p>This man\u2019s appearance was impeccable and handsome. Due to his indifferent expression, there was a suffocating temperament around him that people didn\u2019t dare approach. He stood as still as a statue, like a movie star.</p><br/><p>The people around him looked at him with curious or stunned eyes but Ling Xuefeng ignored them. His deep eyes were only focused on the exit flight.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu finally appeared!</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng\u2019s eyes suddenly lit up.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu wore a comfortable T-shirt and slim jeans on the flight. It was casual clothing but it was difficult to hide his unique temperament. The 23 year old Li Cangyu was old enough to retire from the e-sports industry but he was very young in this crowd. He was tall and well-proportioned, with a pair of straight long legs making him particularly eye-catching.</p><br/><p>His nose, lips and eyes weren\u2019t particularly good but the combination of facial features were good-looking. In particular, when he laughed, there was a type of sunny handsomeness.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu\u2019s gaze swept over the crowd and quickly locked on the target before moving over here.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng\u2019s heart beat violently as he saw Li Cangyu stepping towards him, enough that he could hear his own heartbeat.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu walked very quickly and arrived in front of Ling Xuefeng in the blink of an eye. He looked Ling Xuefeng up and down and said, \u201cYou are wearing a suit. I almost didn\u2019t recognize you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng answered him with a tight hug.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu wasn\u2019t very surprised at being hugged. Whenever they met before, this guy would always come to hug him. Li Cangyu hugged him and patted him on the shoulder, saying, \u201cI really troubled you. There was no need for you to pick me up from the airport.\u201d</p><br/><p>This sentence was obviously platitudes. If it was really troublesome then why run to Shanghai?</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no need to be so polite.\u201d Ling Xuefeng couldn\u2019t help smiling as he whispered, \u201cAre you hungry? I\u2019ll take you to eat fish.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d Li Cangyu immediately replied positively.</p><br/><p>This attitude was really like a big cat following fish.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The two of them headed to the parking lot together. Li Cangyu saw the black Audi in front of him and couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cThis is a nice car.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWould you like me to give it to you?\u201d Ling Xuefeng asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it, my driving skills are terrible.\u201d Li Cangyu sat in the passenger seat.</p><br/><p>\u201cShould I accompany you to a driving school when you\u2019re free?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSay it later.\u201d Li Cangyu was lazy. He liked looking at cars but he had no interest in driving. \u201cIt is said that it is harder and harder to get a driver\u2019s license. I have to buy a car and parking space. The car also has to be maintained. It is really troublesome. I would rather take a taxi directly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018In fact, I can be your driver\u2026\u2019 Ling Xuefeng suppressed this sentence and sat in the driver\u2019s seat, leaving the airport.</p><br/><p>The two of them hadn\u2019t seen each other for a long time but some friends had such a deep understanding that it wasn\u2019t uncomfortable despite the long time span.</p><br/><p>Once the car was steady, Li Cangyu casually asked,\u201dIsn\u2019t the second round of the regular season about to start? Don\u2019t you have to go back to training today?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is the vice-captain.\u201d Ling Xuefeng said, \u201cHe is currently in charge of the team\u2019s training.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Yan Ruiwen is really more careful than you.\u201d Li Cangyu lamented. \u201cRemember when Vice-Captain Yuan retired when he was only 18 years old? Now Yan Ruiwen is the vice-captain. Things are a lot easier for you with things helping.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you the same? You have Bai Xuan to help and you even took him to New York with you.\u201d Ling Xuefeng said.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t take him. Xiao Bai has a serious stomach problem.\u201d Li Cangyu explained, \u201cI went to New York to see my dad and show him Bai Xuan\u2019s stomach problems.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once the explanation was over, he felt a bit strange. Why was he explaining these things to Ling Xuefeng?</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu touched his nose and smiled, moving his gaze to look outside the window.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng looked over and saw his side profile. It was masculine and handsome, with a tall nose and deep facial features that gave off a masculine sexiness. The contrast with his red lips and white skin was very big, making him seem like a type of safe man that girls liked.</p><br/><p>But from his point of view, Ling Xuefeng couldn\u2019t help thinking about\u2026 kissing him.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu seemed to perceive eyes on him and turned away. Ling Xuefeng immediately shifted his gaze.</p><br/><p>The car filled with silence. Li Cangyu hadn\u2019t slept well last night so he simply closed his eyes and went to sleep.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cLazy cat, wake up and get out of the car to eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>A low voice that contained a hint of tenderness suddenly entered his ears.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu opened his eyes and looked into Ling Xuefeng\u2019s deep eyes. He slept very well in the car and hadn\u2019t even dreamt. He didn\u2019t know why. Perhaps Ling Xuefeng just made him feel safe.</p><br/><p>When they played together in the Miracle League, many players were 17 or 18 year old peers who especially loved to play. They often went out for dinner after a game. Every time, Ling Xuefeng would sit next to him and give him fish. This type of quiet care made Li Cangyu feel particularly warm.</p><br/><p>The two of them had many years of friendship. They might be the most powerful opponents in the arena but Li Cangyu had no defense against Ling Xuefeng. For him, Ling Xuefeng was one of the most trustworthy people so he could sleep peacefully beside Ling Xuefeng.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu couldn\u2019t help smiling at Ling Xuefeng. \u201cCough, I\u2019ve been affected by jet lag the last few days and actually fell asleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng spoke softly, \u201cIf you feel tired after eating, do you want to sleep all afternoon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it again later.\u201d</p><br/><p>He unbuckled his seatbelt as he said this and wanted to open the door. He had slept too much and wasn\u2019t completely awake. As a result, he slammed his head into the roof of the car.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng immediately reached out to his forehead. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu said helplessly, \u201cIt isn\u2019t painful at all. I was just disoriented from waking up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng looked at him carefully. The sound just now had been particularly loud but fortunately, it wasn\u2019t serious. Li Cangyu\u2019s forehead was just a bit red and it should be fine after a while.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng couldn\u2019t help sighing with relief.</p><br/><p>In the next second, his back suddenly straightened. It was because his actions made the distance between the two people very close. Ling Xuefeng was half pressed against Li Cangyu\u2019s body and there was only one inch between their faces. If they just leaned forward slightly, they could directly kiss.</p><br/><p>He saw his own reflection in Li Cangyu\u2019s black eyes and Ling Xuefeng paused for a moment, his heartbeat ringing in his ears.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu didn\u2019t move, he just quietly looked at the other person. Ling Xuefeng always felt that this smart cat seemed to see something but Ling Xuefeng didn\u2019t want to confess that he liked this person yet. He moved away and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Li Cangyu didn\u2019t question it and left the car.</p><br/><p>The two of them entered the restaurant together. This store specialized in pickled fish and was quite famous. It was peak lunch hour and there were people waiting in line. Ling Xuefeng had booked in advance so after giving their names, the waiter took them upstairs to a private room.</p><br/><p>The waiter asked, \u201cWe use live fish here. How many pounds do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng looked at Li Cangyu, \u201cIs four pounds enough?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu replied, \u201cSix pounds.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng nodded and said to the waiter. \u201cListen to him and give us six pounds.\u201d</p><br/><p>The waiter, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them wanted to eat such a big fish?</p><br/><p>Once the fish was ordered, Li Cangyu made a satisfied expression. Ling Xuefeng asked, \u201cDo you want anything else?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu said, \u201cNo, I\u2019ll only eat fish.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng ordered two other vegetable dishes before handing the menu back to the waiter.</p><br/><p>A large pot of pickled fish arrived. The six pound fish really looked spectacular. Li Cangyu immediately started. The store chosen by Ling Xuefeng was very good. The fish was fresh and tender while the pickled taste was good. Li Cangyu was very satisfied when eating.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng saw him burying his head to eat fish and couldn\u2019t help smiling.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was truly a big cat who couldn\u2019t move when seeing fish.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu didn\u2019t like to talk during a meal. He only concentrated on eating fish and finally finished the big pot after half an hour. Ling Xuefeng accompanied him and ate the vegetable dishes, filling his stomach.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu wiped his mouth with satisfaction and smiled. \u201cYou have paid off the pickled fish you owe me. Next time, let\u2019s eat steamed bass.\u201d</p><br/><p>He deliberately emphasized the words \u2018steamed bass\u2019.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng pretended to be calm as he replied, \u201cNo problem, next time I will cook for you at home.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>It was still early when the two of them left the restaurant. Li Cangyu said he was going to find a Chinese medicine doctor recommended by his father and Ling Xuefeng willingly drove him.</p><br/><p>The old Chinese medicine practitioner listened to Li Cangyu\u2019s description and gave him some medicines to regulate the gastrointestinal tract. He instructed Li Cangyu to drink it every day on time and it would be effective in one month.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu thanked him, took a few packs of medicine and walked out.</p><br/><p>After returning to the car, Ling Xuefeng asked, \u201cA treatment for stomach problems? Is this medicine for Bai Xuan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu nodded. \u201cYes, my father said that this is better for Xiao Bai\u2019s stomach problems than Western medicine. I\u2019ll bring some back this time to help him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan and Li Cangyu were really as close as brothers. Previously, Ling Xuefeng couldn\u2019t help being jealous but he later found out that Li Cangyu only regarded Bai Xuan as a friend and no longer minded.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is still early. Do you want to go to my place for a while?\u201d Ling Xuefeng asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it convenient to go to the Wind Colour team?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t going to the team, it is my house.\u201d Ling Xuefeng said, \u201cI bought a small place here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Li Cangyu couldn\u2019t help feeling curious. \u201cI haven\u2019t been to your new home.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng had bought a small two bedroom place. He didn\u2019t like a house with too much space because it would look very empty. This house was located in the high-rise area and the property was very good. The layout of the north-south house was very reasonable.</p><br/><p>The two rooms, one of which was the master bedroom with a bathroom, was very large. Ling Xuefeng placed a king size bed inside and removed a side wall, installing a big wardrobe. The other slightly smaller room was refurbished into a study. There was a wall-mounted bookcase and a brand new desktop computer placed on the big table in the middle.</p><br/><p>The living room and dining room was decorated in a simple and stylish manner but the wallpaper was in warm yellow tones, making the whole house look clean and warm.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu wore slippers and agreed with Ling Xuefeng\u2019s taste. This man might look cold and serious but he was very careful. He always knew how to take care of people, making them feel warm and not embarrassed. This was a very rare thing.</p><br/><p>Wouldn\u2019t his future wife definitely be happy living in this cozy home?</p><br/><p>He was just thinking this when Ling Xuefeng suddenly asked, \u201cWhat do you think about the decorating style?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is very nice.\u201d Li Cangyu praised. \u201cI\u2019m not very good at this. You are more careful than me when it comes to the home.\u201d</p><br/><p>The praised Ling Xuefeng was in a good mood. He brought Li Cangyu to his bedroom and said, \u201cIf you are sleepy, sleep for a while. I will send you to the airport at night.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu readily took off his coat and got on the bed. He smiled and said, \u201cI really am sleepy. I\u2019ll take a nap first and leave at 7 o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng had a dreamlike feeling when he saw Li Cangyu sitting on his big bed with a smile. Ling Xuefeng wanted to rush over and kiss him until he was breathless.</p><br/><p>However\u2026 Li Cangyu was really sleepy and didn\u2019t take long to fall asleep.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng forcibly controlled the thoughts in his heart.</p><br/><p>He watched Li Cangyu sleeping quietly and couldn\u2019t help getting a warm feeling in his heart.</p><br/><p>Was it because Li Cangyu trusted Ling Xuefeng that he could sleep so peacefully in this bed?</p><br/><p>\u2018Li Cangyu, this trust you have given me, I will never let you down.</p><br/><p>So before you readily accept me, I won\u2019t do anything that makes you resent me.</p><br/><p>For you, the most important thing at the moment is the Miracle Professional League. You have longed for the Miracle League\u2019s trophy for so long. It is your obsession and your greatest dream. I will support your decision and never affect your progress.</p><br/><p>Come back, my Cat God.</p><br/><p>I am here, waiting for the king to return.\u2019</p><br/>\n</div>"}

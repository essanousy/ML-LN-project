He had been playing Miracle for three years. The dark magician was his favourite class but his hand speed couldn\u2019t keep up. Thus, he could only use the \u2018slow\u2019 style. Of course, this was also related to his nature. Since he was a child, he wasn\u2019t good at communicating with people. When he talked, his tongue couldn\u2019t help knotting. After being laughed at several times, he was even less likely to speak.</p><br/><p>He was like a snail shrinking into his shell. He slowly crawled forward, regardless of what the people around him thought.</p><br/><p>He met Cat God in the game through an accident and was invited by Cat God to join the team. Li Xiaojiang was so excited that his fingers were shaking, but he wasn\u2019t likely to express it. He ran to his boss\u2019 office and could only clench his fist as he said, \u201cI, I want to play, play the game. Next, next month, I won\u2019t come to work.\u201d</p><br/><p>The boss, who was surfing the Internet, glanced at him and asked, \u201cWhat game?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Miracle Professional League.\u201d</p><br/><p>The boss was called Li Hai and he was Li Xiaojiang\u2019s cousin.</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang had been slow since he was a child. He looked dull and his grades weren\u2019t good. After graduating from high school, he didn\u2019t get into a good university. His person\u2019s cultural level wasn\u2019t high and they didn\u2019t have any good ideas for their son\u2019s future. Therefore, they sent him to a provincial city to spend a few years with his cousin.</p><br/><p>His cousin opened an online store in the provincial city, specializing in assembling computers, keyboards, mouses, audio and other peripherals. There was a physical store in the city and the business was very good. The annual income reached millions of yuan.</p><br/><p>He knew this child wasn\u2019t good at communicating with others and asked his cousin to help with miscellaneous tasks such as printing orders and counting inventory, which didn\u2019t require talking to others.</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang did things slowly but he was careful and serious. It was handy for him to do these tasks and he never made a mistake. After finishing his work during the day, he was idle at night and played games. His days were very comfortable.</p><br/><p>Today, he suddenly said that he was going to play in the Miracle Professional League. Li Hai knew the Miracle League very well and thought it was funny. He looked at the blushing teenager and patted his shoulder. Li Hai asked, \u201cYou are going to play competitively at this level? Who\u2019s fooling you? You shouldn\u2019t meet liars.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no.\u201d Li Xiaojiang anxiously explained. \u201cIt is Cat, Cat, Cat\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Hai quickly rushed him. \u201cThere is a relationship with a cat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCat, Cat God asked me to join.\u201d He finally said the sentence in its entirety. Li Xiaojiang sighed with relief and looked at his cousin with eyes full of anticipation.</p><br/><p>Li Hai was startled.</p><br/><p>Cat God?</p><br/><p>Of course, he had heard the name of this great god. Some time ago, Cat God was the behind the scenes strategist at the World Carnival and he heated up the country. As a veteran of Miracle, he naturally heard the news of Cat God\u2019s return.</p><br/><p>Did his stupid cousin really meet Cat God?</p><br/><p>Li Hai couldn\u2019t help feeling excited and asked, \u201cAre you sure that it is Cat God? You\u2019re not joking?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang nodded seriously. \u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Hai excitedly cried out, \u201cQuickly quickly, take me to meet Cat God!\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was chatting with everyone on the voice channel. In less than half an hour, Li Xiaojiang came back and whispered, \u201cCat, Cat God, I\u2019m back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then the voice of an adult male was heard. \u201cHey, is Cat God really there?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu replied, \u201cI am Old Cat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Hai was excited. \u201cAre you Cat God?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes\u2026 how are you related to Xiao Li?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Hai explained, \u201cI am Li Xiaojiang\u2019s cousin. Xiaojiang\u2019s parents aren\u2019t local and he is currently working in my store. He just told me that Cat God wanted him to join the professional league. I thought he was dreaming!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled. \u201cI\u2019m sincerely inviting Xiaojiang to join our team. There is a formal contract after joining. The address of the club is in Changsha. If you are worried, you can come to check the team in person once I return to China. Look and then make a decision.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, the store won\u2019t be busy in a few days so I will take him there!\u201d Li Hai paused before asking uneasily, \u201cCat God, my brother\u2019s level\u2026 can he really play the game? He is a slow child from an early age and I can\u2019t wait to be killed by him in PK.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not mistaken. Xiaojiang is very talented.\u201d Li Cangyu explained warmly.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Li Hai happily patted Li Xiaojiang\u2019s head and said, \u201cThen you have made it! Since Cat God likes you then I can rest assured. Brother will take you to report to the team next month!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Li Xiaojiang was also excited and spoke seriously, \u201cThank, thank you Cat God.\u201d</p><br/><p>His brother happened to be an otaku with an online store. He knew e-sports and Miracle, as well as being familiar with the professional league. This made things much easier to handle. Li Cangyu didn\u2019t need to bother him with more details as Li Hai readily agreed to let his brother play competitively.</p><br/><p>This slow fellow didn\u2019t hesitate too long to decide to join the team. He was clearly very passionate about the Miracle League. This meant he could be well nurtured in the future.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu received a new teammate and was in a good mood.</p><br/><p>He was one member away from his goal of an eight-person team.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>That evening, Li Cangyu commissioned the vice president of the Food Squad to help him write a promotional post that was sent all over the Miracle forums.</p><br/><p>The contents of the post were very concise. [Cat God is bringing a team back to the Miracle Professional League. He is currently looking for teammates. It is room number 7713 in the cross-server arena and the password is 9999. Looking for any strong masters to join!]</p><br/><p>The post made headlines as soon as it was released.</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei was Li Cangyu\u2019s biggest fanboy and he naturally saw the post. He quickly forwarded the forum post to Weibo with the comment: [Where are the masters? Quickly join! Cat God\u2019s team is absolutely trustworthy!]</p><br/><p>Someone couldn\u2019t help commenting below: [Aren\u2019t you the vice-captain of Time? Why are you helping Cat God to advertise?] [Cheng Wei\u2019s heart is with Old Cat. Poor Captain Tan.] [\u2018Pained Captain Tan team\u2019] [\u2018Strongly Distressed Captain Tan team\u2019 +1]</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei was somewhat upset when he saw the comments below his Weibo. He looked for Tan Shitian to explain but didn\u2019t expect Tan Shitian to act so generously by forwarding the same post and writing: [Cat God\u2019s team should be full. If you are interested in playing in the professional league, you should seize this opportunity.]</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei was moved as he knocked on the door of the bedroom. \u201cWhy did you write that on Weibo? I thought you would scold me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian smiled and rubbed Cheng Wei\u2019s head. \u201cHow can I scold you? It doesn\u2019t matter if you help Cat God with advertising. Can\u2019t people on different teams be friends?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei agreed, \u201cYes! People on different teams can also be friends!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian added, \u201cIt is fine as long as you don\u2019t go easy on Cat God when you encounter him in matches.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei immediately formed fists and declared confidently, \u201cIt is impossible for me to go easy on him. If I met Cat God on the field, I won\u2019t be polite and will beat him up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He was bullied by Cat God yet he wanted to beat Cat God up? Wasn\u2019t this too much?</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>To the surprise of the fans, Ling Xuefeng also forwarded it along with Tan and Cheng. Captain Ling wrote straightforward words: [Help expand.]</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng\u2019s personality was solemn and cold. His Weibo was like an official promotional platform. He rarely wrote anything about his private life and usually only forwarded news about the professional league and the Wind Colour team. However, many careful fans found that since the appearance of Cat God, Captain Ling actually forwarded news related to Cat God three times in a row.</p><br/><p>The first one was Tan Shitian\u2019s story about the big cat and kitten. Captain Ling explained that the big cat and the kitten had a father-son relationship. The second was the matter of the behind the scenes strategist at the World Carnival. Captain Ling forwarded Old Cat\u2019s post. Today, Cat God\u2019s team was recruiting and Captain Ling forwarded a post to help increase the publicity.</p><br/><p>Fans were very puzzled. [Captain Ling seems to care about Cat God?] [Weren\u2019t they the strongest opponents?] [The question about who is the best summoner in the league hasn\u2019t been settled. Captain Ling must refuel to kill Old Cat!] [Kill the Cat +1]</p><br/><p>[Kill the Cat + ID number.]</p><br/><p>A bunch of \u2018Kill the Cat\u2019 filled the comments.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng sat calmly in front of the computer but he was thinking, \u2018What do you know? That cat is mine.\u2019</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The news that Cat God was recruiting teammates was widely forwarded by professional players, and it clearly had an overwhelming publicity effect. Xiao Han\u2019s challenge room was overcrowded. Many people who couldn\u2019t enter had to queue up outside.</p><br/><p>Some people gladly paid 1,000 gold coins to enter the challenge arena and see Cat God\u2019s face. It was a pity that most of them couldn\u2019t see Cat God\u2019s face as they were sent away by Xiao Han.</p><br/><p>The people watching the screen excitedly typed: [Lick Cat God!] [Cat God, please give me a signature!] [Love to Eat Braised Fish is actually Cat God! The members of the Food Squad are very proud!] [Cat God, come out! Don\u2019t be shy!] [Cat God, do you want to personally beat me up? I want to fight the strategist behind the scenes!]</p><br/><p>There were too many people who flocked to the room after hearing Cat God\u2019s name. More than 95% of them came to join the fun and only a few had the strength to fight in the challenge arena.</p><br/><p>Today\u2019s challenge arena opened until 2 p.m. in New York, which was 2 a.m. in China.</p><br/><p>Since Cat God didn\u2019t make a public appearance, the first wave of people gradually dispersed. It was late at night and only a few dozen people were left as onlookers. Xiao Han had been playing since morning and he was tired and dizzy. He let Frost Descends sit in the middle of the arena to rest as he went to the bathroom.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu had thrown his apprentice into the arena to train Xiao Han\u2019s ability to cope with challengers alone.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu saw his apprentice come out of the bathroom with a tired expression and softened. He waved to Xiao Han and said, \u201cCome rest for a while. Eat some fruit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han immediately came over and took a peeled apple from Bai Xuan.</p><br/><p>Li Yunyu asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the situation like in the arena? There still isn\u2019t a harvest?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han bit the apple and replied, \u201cMost of them came to get Master\u2019s signature. There was no one who beat me this morning.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu and Bai Xuan looked at each other.</p><br/><p>This high-intensity challenge mode was actually an excellent exercise opportunity for Xiao Han.</p><br/><p>Xiao Han, who only knew how to kill people from behind, was now winning against hundreds of people of different races and classes. The fact that no one beat him this morning made Li Cangyu surprised and very happy. His apprentice was gradually changing and hadn\u2019t realized the progress he was making.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was silent for a moment before saying, \u201cWait for me and I will go to the arena to check.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Surprisingly, the duo returned after eating fruit and found a person sitting in the ring.</p><br/><p>The man was sitting next to Xiao Han\u2019s assassin and the room was filled with messages that he had sent: [Is Cat God there? I came to join your team.]</p><br/><p>[Cat God?]</p><br/><p>[Cat God, accept me. My level isn\u2019t bad!]</p><br/><p>[I am young and have a first-class awareness. I am very talented and there is a lot of room for progress!]</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m sure that I will become a strong teammate! [Haha][Haha].]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>His boasting ability was quite good.</p><br/><p>Was he as skilled as his mouth? Of course, Li Cangyu had to judge it himself.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu logged into his summoner account on the next computer. He made another arena room and had Xiao Han send the person a message: [Room 7319, the password is 8899. Come for a fight.]</p><br/>\n</div>"}

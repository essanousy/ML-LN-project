His family was obviously rich since his father bought a duplex that was nearly 300 square metres in Suzhou. There were four bedrooms scattered upstairs and downstairs, as well as a separate study and gym. The house was simple, elegant and spacious.</p><br/><p>His parents were at home and it wasn\u2019t good to sleep together in front of elders. Ling Xuefeng arranged for Li Cangyu to stay in the room opposite his bedroom on the upper floor. Li Cangyu had no opinion on this and quietly went into the room to sleep.</p><br/><p>The next morning, Li Cangyu ate breakfast with Ling Xuefeng. Yuan Xin said that she would go to the supermarket to handle the new year\u2019s goods. Li Cangyu took the initiative to say, \u201cAuntie, I will accompany you. I can\u2019t buy food but I can help with the bags.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yuan Xin agreed with a smile. \u201cThen come with me and act as my hired labourer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu joked, \u201cAuntie, it is my honour to be your hired labourer!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them laughed and talked on the way to the supermarket to buy food. Ling Xuefeng stayed at home and helped his father with the couplets. (TL: verses written vertically that are stuck on the doorways on Chinese New Year as a blessing).</p><br/><p>Ling Boyan was more traditional and attached great importance to the Spring Festival. Every year, he personally had to put up couplets at the door. The windows also had the character \u2018Fu\u2019 hung while two festive lanterns hung from the living room\u2019s balcony.</p><br/><p>Of course, after Ling Xuefeng grew up, these activities were done by him.</p><br/><p>He was just hanging up the lanterns when he heard his father\u2019s voice behind him, \u201cAre you sure you want to be with this Li Cangyu?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Ling Xuefeng answered decisively. \u201cNo one in this world is more suitable for him than me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Boyan frowned. \u201cThe two of you, is your relationship certain right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d Ling Xuefeng replied honestly. \u201cHowever, it is almost the same. I love him and he also likes me. Dad, you can rest assured that my eyes aren\u2019t wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Boyan was silent for a moment before nodding. \u201cIt is your own matter. Handle it yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>At the supermarket, Li Cangyu pushed the shopping cart and walked behind as a hired labourer. Yuan Xin put things inside while telling Li Cangyu many things about her son when he was a child.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur Xuefeng, he hasn\u2019t been talkative since childhood. He looked very cold so many children didn\u2019t like to play with him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did he act when he was a child?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe drew or read books at home. But his drawings are really ugly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so? Auntie, show me once we go back.\u201d Li Cangyu was interested in Ling Xuefeng\u2019s black history.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. I have collected them and will show you when we get back.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two people chatted while shopping. They soon bought the food required for the new year and returned home. Yuan Xin went into the kitchen to cook. Before that, she took Li Cangyu to the study to show him Ling Xuefeng\u2019s collection of childhood drawings.</p><br/><p>He was really soul drawer! What was this mess?</p><br/><p>If this black history was posted to the forums, it was unknown how Captain Ling\u2019s fans would react.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was looking at them with relish when Ling Xuefeng suddenly pushed open the door and saw Li Cangyu observing his black history. His expression wasn\u2019t embarrassed as he stated calmly, \u201cThey were drawn when I was a child.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu asked curiously, \u201cYou loved to draw as a child. Then what about how? Have your drawing skills improved?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu patted him on the shoulder. \u201cYou are so honest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng smiled slightly and said, \u201cMy dad told you to go and play basketball.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, I will go and play with Uncle for a while. You go help Auntie, she is busy in the kitchen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two people worked together, one accompanied Father Ling while the other spend a harmonious time with his mother.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu accompanied Ling Boyan to play basketball for a bit on the open-air basketball court. He didn\u2019t expect that Ling Boyan would be so strong and have such a high basketball level despite being in his 40s. Li Cangyu thought he would let Father Ling win but he could barely make it a tie.</p><br/><p>Ling Boyan explained, \u201cI used to be the captain of the basketball team when I was in school.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so? Li Cangyu praised him. \u201cNo wonder why you are so amazing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Boyan threw the ball at Li Cangyu. He saw the other person catch it and said with satisfaction, \u201cCome again.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The duo played for two hours until Ling Xuefeng called them home.</p><br/><p>At home, Yuan Xin had already finished making dinner. The thing that surprised Li Cangyu was that there were two more guests. One was a middle-aged uncle and the other was a young man who looked familiar.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng took the initiative to introduce them. \u201cThis is my uncle and cousin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu politely greeted them.</p><br/><p>The cousin saw Li Cangyu and immediately came over to shake hands. \u201cXiao Li, long time no see. Don\u2019t you know me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu observed the person carefully and finally recognized him. \u201cAh, Vice-Captain Yuan!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng\u2019s cousin, Yuan Shaozhe was the first vice-captain of the Wind Colour team.</p><br/><p>At that time, Yuan Shaozhe and Ling Xuefeng had come to Hangzhou to invite him to the Wind Colour team. Yuan Shaozhe had only been in his early 20s and now he was a mature man of 27.</p><br/><p>Yuan Shaozhe retired at the end of the second season and handed over the vice-captain\u2019s position to Yan Ruiwen. Li Cangyu had played against him many times on the field and was impressed with his blood kin summoner.</p><br/><p>They unexpectedly met here. Li Cangyu asked doubtfully, \u201cWhere did you go after retirement? Why haven\u2019t I heard from you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, once I retired, I went to the Miracle League as a data director. I\u2019m mainly responsible for the balance of data in the online game and the league. I transferred from the stage to behind the scenes. You\u2026\u201d Yuan Shaozhe paused and carefully examined the youth in front of him.</p><br/><p>Yuan Shaozhe had definitely heard about what happened to Li Cangyu in the past few years. A few years ago, the 17 year old boy resolutely refused the position of vice-captain of Wind Colour and firmly said, \u201cI want to build a team myself.\u201d Yuan Shaozhe had tried to persuade him but the determination in the young man\u2019s eyes made Yuan Shaozhe give up.</p><br/><p>After so many years, Li Cangyu was a lot more mature than the memories. However, the confidence and determination in his eyes were exactly the same as that original youth.</p><br/><p>He was a tough person who became braver the more frustrations he experienced.</p><br/><p>Yuan Shaozhe looked at him with appreciation and couldn\u2019t help smiling, \u201cI heard that you are returning to Miracle?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu nodded. \u201cYes, my team has been assembled and we are preparing to play in the seventh season of the professional league.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I am feeling very optimistic.\u201d Yuan Shaozhe patted Li Cangyu\u2019s shoulder with approval. Then he asked, \u201cBy the way, why did you come to Xuefeng\u2019s place for the new year?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu thought, \u2018I want to advance our relationship through meeting the family and then take Ling Xuefeng as my wife.\u2019</p><br/><p>However, Li Cangyu naturally didn\u2019t dare tell the truth to Yuan Shaozhe. He touched his nose and calmly explained, \u201cMy parents are abroad and I didn\u2019t have anywhere to spend the holidays. Xuefeng took me home to eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yuan Shaozhe was surprised. \u201cIt is like me! My mother isn\u2019t home and my father and I can\u2019t cook. That\u2019s why we came to my aunt\u2019s house for a meal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled. \u201cIt is really a coincidence.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng heard him lying so easily and slightly smiled. He calmly interrupted them, \u201cGo to eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>There were many people gathered at the dinner table. They watched TV while eating dinner and this Chinese New Year was incredibly lively.</p><br/><p>Once the New Year\u2019s Eve dinner was over, the Yuan Shaoze father and son set up a table of mahjong with Ling Boyan and Yuan Xin. Ling Xuefeng went upstairs to take a bath. Li Cangyu didn\u2019t play mahjong but he sat next to them to watch.</p><br/><p>Yuan Xin\u2019s heart warmed when she saw Li Cangyu sitting with them and couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cXiao Li, you go to sleep first. You don\u2019t need to accompany us. We will play all night and we greet the dawn like every holidays.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yuan Shaozhe echoed her words, \u201cYes, you aren\u2019t playing anyway. Go upstairs and play Miracle with Xuefeng.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yuan Xin continued, \u201cOr take a shower first and go to sleep early.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu didn\u2019t understand mahjong and had been watching in a confused daze. Once he heard this, he stood up and said, \u201cThen I will go upstairs to take a shower. Uncle, Auntie, Uncle, Cousin, you play well!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yuan Xin smiled. \u201cGo!\u201d</p><br/><p>This handsome young man was sensible and talked to his elders so smoothly. It was estimated that soon after, his uncle and aunt could be changed into father and mother!</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu went upstairs and took a shower. It wasn\u2019t midnight yet and he was bored. Thus, he gently knocked on the opposite door that belonged to Ling Xuefeng. \u201cXuefeng, are you asleep?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sleeping. Come in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu pushed open the door and saw that Ling Xuefeng was sitting on his bed and drying his hair. The man who just showered had a layer of water vapor on his body. His moist hair hung over his eyes and water kept dripping down. A sexy collarbone was exposed and his neck moved up and down as he spoke.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu gulped, wanting to directly go over and nibble.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng looked up and saw that the big cat was standing motionless. He couldn\u2019t help wondering, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu recovered and pretended to be calm. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d He smiled and sat down next to Ling Xuefeng. \u201cI was bored and couldn\u2019t sleep. Let\u2019s greet the new year together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng asked curiously, \u201cDo you still have the habit of greeting it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, before my father and sister went abroad, our family of four would stay up to 1 o\u2019clock to greet the Spring Festival and see the fireworks. I only feel like it is the new year when it is the Spring Festival.\u201d Li Cangyu spoke emotionally, \u201cSince my father went abroad, I have never had such a lively Spring Festival.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng looked at the man lost in his memories and gentleness filled his eyes. He whispered, \u201cDo you want to set off fireworks? I have some at home.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu\u2019s eyes brightened. \u201cYou have fireworks? Why didn\u2019t you say so earlier?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy father and I don\u2019t like them. The fireworks that my mother buys every year will eventually be taken by relatives for their children to play with.\u201d Ling Xuefeng got up and grabbed a bunch of fireworks from the study. He found a lighter, turned off the lights in the house and then took Li Cangyu with him to the window, pushing open the window.</p><br/><p>He had grabbed all the long fireworks that he could hold in his hand. They each took one and lit them with the lighter. Then they tacitly reached out of the window at the same time.</p><br/><p>Not long afterwards, they heard whooshing sounds in their ears. Two red and blue clusters of fireworks exploded in the night sky. The decorated sky was extraordinarily beautiful and illuminated the two faces.</p><br/><p>The two of them didn\u2019t speak as they continued to light fireworks. The booming sound of the fireworks seemed in line with their heartbeats, producing a warm melody.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t until the fireworks in their hands stopped moving that the two men looked at each other and laughed.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu said, \u201cTwo big men standing together while setting off fireworks. Haven\u2019t we suddenly become childish?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng replied, \u201cNo, there is no stipulation that adults can\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen do you want to do it again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng agreed. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, the clock reached 0 and every household started to set off fireworks to welcome the arrival of the new year. Countless fireworks soared, making the two people\u2019s faces particularly clear.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu looked at Ling Xuefeng\u2019s handsome face set against the fireworks. His heart suddenly moved and he had a strong desire to tell the other person his heart. It was a monstrous wave that swept over his mind in an instant.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Li Cangyu was just about to talk when he heard Ling Xuefeng\u2019s low and familiar voice in his ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cI like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The deafening sound of fireworks outside couldn\u2019t cover up Ling Xuefeng\u2019s simple and direct confession.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu thought he had misheard and looked at the man in front of him with shock. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI like you.\u201d Ling Xuefeng softly repeated. He saw Li Cangyu\u2019s big eyes and couldn\u2019t help laughing. He leaned over and accurately kissed Li Cangyu\u2019s lips.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Outside the window, fireworks of various colours bloomed in the sky, causing the night sky to be as bright as day.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu felt his mind become blank as he was kissed. It was as if something was wrong but\u2026 Ling Xuefeng\u2019s kiss was too gentle. His tongue gently opened Li Cangyu\u2019s mouth, slowly and thoughtfully sweeping through every inch of his mouth. Li Cangyu couldn\u2019t help indulging in this kiss.</p><br/><p>This was the best New Year\u2019s gift for him!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

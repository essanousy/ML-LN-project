Cat God, shall we go now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming came over and joked, \u201cTwo beautiful women accompanying you to dinner, this is an opportunity.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled and said, \u201cYes, I\u2019ll exchange tactics with them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming lowered his voice. \u201cWho asked you to exchange tactics? Can\u2019t you think about anything other than tactics? As far as I know, Yu Bing and Liu Xiang are single. You have to seize the chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu understood what he meant and bluntly countered, \u201cYou are single and should worry about yourself first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming made a heavy expression after being blocked. \u201cI am a rough man older than 25 years old and certainly won\u2019t be liked by girls. Alas\u2026 I should go back to the hotel to wash and sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu watched Old Zhang\u2019s slightly desolate back and sighed helplessly. A bold person like Zhang Jueming would find it really hard to gain a girl\u2019s favour. In addition, his career hadn\u2019t been very good the past few years. He worked hard to earn money to open a studio and love affairs were delayed.</p><br/><p>However, Li Cangyu believed there would definitely be a person who understood Old Zhang.</p><br/><p>He arrived at the restaurant with Liu Xiang and Yu Bing was already waiting there. She wore white pencil pants and a casual shirt, along with a pair of high heels and sunglasses on her face. She looked like a celebrity afraid of a paparazzi\u2019s sneak shot.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu stepped forward and sat down opposite her. \u201cIs it necessary to be dressed like this for a meal?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Bing said quietly, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be linked to gossip with you again.\u201d</p><br/><p>He thought about the time when they were photographed eating by reporters and netizens said there was something between them. As the number one gossip item linked with Yu Bing, Li Cangyu stated calmly, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I will explain it if we are really photographed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Bing smiled and wondered, \u201cWon\u2019t your lover be jealous?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu replied, \u201cNo, he is very rational and will believe in me.\u201d (TL: Uses gender neutral Chinese words)</p><br/><p>Yu Bing took off her sunglasses with surprise. \u201cYou really have a lover?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu coughed as he found himself falling into her language trap and touched his nose. \u201cYu Bing, you have been commentating for a few years. Your way of speaking has become more skillful?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Bing smiled. \u201cIt is an occupational need.\u201d</p><br/><p>The silent Liu Xiang couldn\u2019t help interjecting, \u201cCat God has a girlfriend?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled, not intending to answer.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiang also smiled. \u201cIf it is inconvenient to say then it doesn\u2019t matter. I just think that your girlfriend will definitely be depressed. You must not have much time to accompany her?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Bing turned back, \u201cXiao Xiang, don\u2019t be so direct. Cat God must be very qualified as a boyfriend, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu felt slightly guilty. He really didn\u2019t have much time to accompany his lover. An average person would certainly have problems with such a boyfriend. However, Ling Xuefeng was as busy as he was. Both of them were professional players and understood each other.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiang changed the topic. \u201cCat God, did you hear the recent news about the league?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu suppressed his thoughts and asked, \u201cWhat news?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiang explained, \u201cThis year\u2019s second World Carnival, the selection mechanism might change. The online voting method from last year will no longer be used.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was surprised. The last Carnival was a test and the simplest online voting method was used to select six representatives. Did the chairman change the strategy to prepare for the World Competition?</p><br/><p>Sure enough, Yu Bing said, \u201cI heard that the captain of this season\u2019s championship team will directly win one of the six seats. The remaining five will be selected from the final national team players.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu nodded. \u201cThe chairman wants the Carnival players to test it first?\u201d</p><br/><p>If they followed the online voting method, it was likely that the netizens might not choose someone on the national team. Thus, a direct selection from the national team would allow the members to go to the world stage and see the situation of players in other countries. Chairman Nan Jiangang\u2019s consideration was very thoughtful.</p><br/><p>The trio talked while eating. Yu Bing knew Li Cangyu\u2019s preferences and gave him a sweet and sour fish that was especially delicious in Suzhou. Li Cangyu was very satisfied with this meal.</p><br/><p>The surprising thing was that there was no one in the room when he returned to the hotel.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu opened the door to his room and found Zhang Jueming surfing the Internet. He went over and asked doubtfully, \u201cWhy are you here? Where are the others?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming explained, \u201cAh Shu took them into the city to go shopping. Vice-Captain Bai wasn\u2019t at ease and accompanied them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t go?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming smiled. \u201cI have no interest in shopping so I stayed back to go on the Internet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu called Bai Xuan who said that everyone were still exploring. Li Cangyu told them to pay attention to safety and then hung up to bathe.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong said he would bring the newcomers shopping but he actually wanted to go shopping with Bai Xuan.</p><br/><p>However, he knew that Vice-Captain Bai wouldn\u2019t agree if they were alone. He made up an excuse to call out Xiao Gu, Xiao Zhuo, Xiao Han and Xiao Li, saying, \u201cBrother Shu will buy you gifts. Let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>The teenagers heard it was a present and actively followed.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong wrapped himself around Bai Xuan and said, \u201cVice-Captain Bai, I\u2019m not familiar with Suzhou and don\u2019t know how to look at maps. Can you go with us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan helplessly had to follow this group, dutifully acting as navigator.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong took them to dinner and then they headed to a nearby shopping mall. He said that he would be everyone a gift and the newcomers didn\u2019t have to be polite.</p><br/><p>Gu Siming soon picked a present. It was a new solo game that had recently been released online. He had been paying attention to it for a long time and always wanted to buy it. Today, Ah Shu was paying and he decisively decided to buy it.</p><br/><p>Xiao Han went for a high-capacity hard drive. He downloaded too many American movies and didn\u2019t have room on his computer\u2019s hard drive. He would use this as a back up.</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang picked a summer cap and tried it on in front of the mirror. He smiled and said, \u201cToo handsome. Why can\u2019t I bear to take it off?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong decisively said, \u201cThen buy it!\u201d</p><br/><p>All three people had chosen a gift. Li Xiaojiang followed behind everyone and didn\u2019t know what to pick. There were too many good things in the mall, many of which he had never seen before. Those clothes looked delicate, they must be expensive?</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong saw the small snail alone in the back and couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cXiaojiang, you also pick one.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang\u2019s face was red. \u201cNo, no, Brother Shu, it isn\u2019t easy for you to make money. You don\u2019t need to buy for me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang wrapped an arm around his shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t be polite. Tree God is in a good mood today and wants to buy us gifts. Just directly say what you want!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang\u2019s eyes moved in a circle and stopped on an outdoor sports store for a moment. Zhuo Hang followed his gaze and found that he was staring at a pair of shoes with envious eyes. Zhuo Hang immediately pulled him into the store. \u201cCome on, you like it so try it on.\u201d</p><br/><p>The employee enthusiastically came over and asked, \u201cHello, what size shoes do you wear?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang\u2019s face was red and he remained silent.</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the size of your shoes?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang hesitated for a moment before whispering, \u201cSize 37.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was a small size among men\u2019s shoes and often weren\u2019t available. Zhuo Hang was a bit surprised. He didn\u2019t expect Li Xiaojiang\u2019s feet to be so small.</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang had always found it difficult to buy the right size shoes at the mall and would sometimes suffer from the staff\u2019s eyes. The thing that surprised him was that this beautiful sister didn\u2019t laugh at him. Instead, she brought him a pair of size 37 shoes in a friendly manner. \u201cTry this one first. There are other styles.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang was flattered and tried on the shoes. They were really comfortable to wear\u2026</p><br/><p>The employee asked, \u201cDo you like this? Would you like to see another style?\u201d</p><br/><p>He liked it but the price\u2026</p><br/><p>He was hesitating when Xie Shurong went to the side and readily used his card. He put the wrapped new shoes into Li Xiaojiang\u2019s hands and smiled. \u201cYou like it so don\u2019t hesitate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang held the shoes and looked at him with a touched expression. \u201cBrother Shu, thank you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Once he bought the four little guys a gift, Xie Shurong said, \u201cI will buy myself a present as well. You can help me!\u201d</p><br/><p>He took everyone to an area where men\u2019s clothes were sold. There were many dazzling branded suits in the area.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong asked, \u201cWhich one looks good?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Siming pointed to a red set. \u201cThis one!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang interrupted him. \u201cThis suit looks very old. Think about Brother Shu\u2019s age. I think blue suits him better.\u201d</p><br/><p>He pointed to a blue set and told Xie Shurong, \u201cThis one is good!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han thoughtfully went to the side and pointed to a grey suit. \u201cI think this set is more acceptable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone automatically ignored his grammatical mistakes. Xie Shurong didn\u2019t listen to the three people\u2019s advice. He looked back and smiled at Bai Xuan. \u201cVice-Captain Bai, what do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan asked, \u201cDo you really want to buy it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong nodded. \u201cAs a grown man, how can I do without a suit? I can wear it when attending formal occasions. Help me pick one.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Siming exclaimed, \u201cYes, Vice-Captain Bai should pick it. You must have a good eye.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan had to smile. \u201cOkay, I will help you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He looked closely at Xie Shurong\u2019s figure before going to a suits store. He glanced over a row of neatly displayed suits before eventually picking a white suit with a blue shirt and striped tie.</p><br/><p>He picked it and told Xie Shurong to try it on. Xie Shurong immediately ran over and happily changed into it.</p><br/><p>He left the dressing room and everyone felt that he was eye-catching. The tall figure of the young man was appropriately set up by the suit that fit him perfectly. He was handsome and sunny. In this suit, he looked like the protagonist of an idol drama!</p><br/><p>Gu Siming excitedly circled Ah Shu., \u201cYou are so handsome! This suit is really suitable. Vice-Captain Bai truly has great eyes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han added, \u201cAh Shu\u2019s temperament is very good when wearing white.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang also said, \u201cWhite isn\u2019t something that an average person can control. Xiao Han is right. Some people will appear very pale when wearing white. I think that Brother Shu is particularly suitable for white. You look handsome!\u201d</p><br/><p>The young guys acted like honey was in their mouth. It was because Xie Shurong bought gifts for them but most of them were telling the truth.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan also thought that Xie Shurong was suitable for these clothes and smiled. Xie Shurong might still be far from Bai Xuan\u2019s ideal mature and stable man but he had to admit that Ah Shu was really sunny and handsome.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong walked to Bai Xuan while adjusting his tie and asked, \u201cHow is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan said appreciatively, \u201cNot bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I will buy this one.\u201d</p><br/><p>He excitedly ran to swipe his card. He wrapped up his old clothes and simply wore the new suit.</p><br/><p>They returned to the hotel and Xie Shurong continued to look at himself in the mirror. Bai Xuan saw his smug expression and finally couldn\u2019t help wondering, \u201cWhat happened to you today? You suddenly took them to buy gifts and bought a suit for yourself?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong turned around with a smile. \u201cBuying gifts was just an excuse. My purpose was to have you pick a suit for me and I\u2019ll wear it for you. Don\u2019t you think that I\u2019m handsome?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018I just think that your skin is thicker?\u2019</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong suddenly said, \u201cIn fact, today is my birthday.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan was stunned and embarrassed. \u201cCough, happy birthday. Why didn\u2019t you say anything? Everyone should be buying you birthday gifts. Why did you suddenly reverse it and ended up buying gifts for everyone?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. Meeting you is my best gift. In particular, you let me understand the feeling of liking a person. This is more precious than any gift.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Bai Xuan felt numb. This guy was really sweet enough to give him a toothache.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan\u2019s face turned slightly red and Xie Shurong couldn\u2019t help smiling in a handsome manner. \u201cYou look great when blushing. I want to kiss you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan\u2019s ears turned red. How could there be such a shameless person? He clearly rejected Xie Shurong so how he could become more shameless?</p><br/><p>It turned out that Xie Shurong could be even more shameless.</p><br/><p>He took advantage of Bai Xuan\u2019s blushing time and suddenly kissed Bai Xuan on the forehead. \u201cI like you, I really like you. This is my birthday present so don\u2019t be angry okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>The forehead kiss was as light as a feather. Bai Xuan wanted to be angry but he couldn\u2019t. It was because he felt the sincerity in Xie Shurong\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Bringing a few small lightbulbs to go shopping but it was just to let Bai Xuan pick a suit for him. It could be said that Xie Shurong remembered the words Bai Xuan casually said about a suit and seriously recorded it in his heart.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

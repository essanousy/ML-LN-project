The last player to survive would win the game and the winning team would accumulate three points. The team battle was a 6V6 battle to capture the crystals. There were three crystals: red, blue and white. One crystal was worth two points for a total of six points. This way, the total score for each match in the regular season was nine points.</p><br/><p>This game model of the arena and team battle had been in use since the first season. It was the unified system according to Miracle\u2019s official regulations and was used in the Professional Leagues of all countries.</p><br/><p>The eight teams in the first division would be ranked by the total number of points after two rounds in the regular season. The top four would enter the playoffs and would knock each other out until there was the winner, runner up and third place team.</p><br/><p>This time, Wind Colour and Time met in the regular season and both had very high chances of winning the season.</p><br/><p>Both were traditionally strong teams. No one could doubt the personal ability and command level of Ling Xuefeng. On the other hand, the old captain might\u2019ve retired after the fourth season and the rookie Tan Shitian took over as captain, but Tan Shitian\u2019s commanding style was very flexible and responsive. He was among the leading players in the next generation of players and his strength couldn\u2019t be underestimated.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe seats for today\u2019s game are packed. I believe that many spectators are currently waiting in front of the screen for the showdown between Wind Colour and Time.\u201d Once the leaderboard was finished, Yu Bing continued. \u201cWe know that Wind Colour\u2019s play is dominated by dark spells and most players are of the demon or blood kin races. Meanwhile, the Time team favours the light department and they are mainly elves or angel players. The two teams have truly met their match.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it is as Sister Bing said. These two teams are old rivals and I think many people are looking forward to today\u2019s game.\u201d Kou Hongyi followed closely. \u201cThe game will start soon and the players have officially entered. Let\u2019s look at the preparations of players on both sides.\u201d</p><br/><p>The live broadcast cut to a soundproof room. The players were already seated in their uniforms.</p><br/><p>The Wind Colour team took the characteristics of the demon and blood kin race. They wore pure black T-shirts with a small amount of red embellishments. This simple black-red look was domineering. Meanwhile, the Time team had a pure white uniform with a small amount of elf green forest embellishments. They looked sunny and the style of the Time team was very harmonious.</p><br/><p>One was dark and one bright, the two teams were clearly enemies in the Miracle League.</p><br/><p>The screen zoomed in on the two captains. Once he saw Ling Xuefeng\u2019s handsome face on the computer screen, Li Cangyu couldn\u2019t help laughing. \u201cThis person still hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was just as handsome as before and his face still had no expression.</p><br/><p>He sat in front of the computer and quickly tapped on the keyboard with his slender fingers. This was Ling Xuefeng\u2019s habitual pre-match warm up. His hand speed was very fast and his tapping fingers dazzled the people watching. They could imagine how this man\u2019s terrible speed would erupt at key moments in the game.</p><br/><p>Compared to him, Tan Shitian looked relaxed as he smiled in the soundproof room. He rubbed Cheng Wei\u2019s head and didn\u2019t know what to say. Cheng Wei sent him a look before turning to his position and ignoring him.</p><br/><p>A group of fans excitedly wrote in the comments area: <i>Captain Tan rubbed his head!</i> \u2013<i>If Vice-Captain Cheng doesn\u2019t let you rub his head, I will give you ten heads to rub!</i></p><br/><p><i>-Our Vice-Captain debuted earlier than you and his head is smaller than yours!</i><i>Don\u2019t bully him!</i></p><br/><p>Wind Colour\u2019s fans said: <i>Asking for a crushing by Captain Ling!</i><i>Asking Captain Ling for an outbreak!</i></p><br/><p>\u2013<i>Captain Ling is handsome when he abuses the opponent!</i></p><br/><p>\u2013<i>Captain Ling smiles at good opponents. When he doesn\u2019t smile, the opponents will be under an extreme psychological pressure!</i></p><br/><p>The game hadn\u2019t yet started and there were already tens of thousands of messages in the comments area. It was obvious that the two teams were extremely popular. Not only were the seats full but many viewers were watching the live broadcast.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Finally, the hour hand pointed to 9 o\u2019clock and the camera cut to the big screen in the centre of the stadium. The words \u2018The Miracle Professional League\u2019s sixth season \u2022 The last match in the first round of the regular season \u2022 Time VS Wind Colour\u2019 appeared on the screen, causing warm applause.</p><br/><p>Yu Bing said, \u201cAudience and viewers, the match between Time and Wind Colour is about to start. The referee is in place and let\u2019s first look at the single-elimination battle\u2026 The two captains have submitted the players order list. The first player for Time is Vice-Captain Cheng Wei while the first player for Wind Colour is Vice-Captain Yan Ruiwen. Then the first stage of the arena will be the confrontation between a white magician and a black magician.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a coincidence.\u201d Kou Hongyi smiled and said, \u201cVice-Captain Yan and Vice-Captain Cheng are the top players in the magician class. The black and white magic are incompatible with each other and the mutual restraints are very serious. This duel will certainly be exciting!\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, Cheng Wei\u2019s character \u2018Only Dedication\u2019 and Yan Ruiwen\u2019s character \u2018Unforgettable\u2019 entered the competition room.</p><br/><p>Only Dedication was wearing white angel equipment. His hands held a staff where the tip had a three layered ring symbolizing peace. The centre emitting a dazzling silver-white light. Unforgettable wore pure black magician robes and his staff had purple vines wrapped around it. The tip was similar to the shape of an eye, giving off a hint of dark arrogance.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can see that the weapons chosen by the two players are the angel\u2019s Bright Heart and the demon\u2019s Eye of Death. The two weapons\u2019 data are very close and maximum magic damage is added.\u201d Kou Hongyi spoke excitedly, \u201cVice-Captain Yan and Vice-Captain Cheng should show us the ultimate showdown between black and white magic. Let\u2019s see who can seize the chance!\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The match officially started.</p><br/><p>The arena map for the regular season was very simple. It was a wide square with light marble tiles and a circular fountain in the middle for players to walk around. This terrain was fair to both players.</p><br/><p>Kou Hongyi just finished speaking when the two players met at the central fountain on the screen.</p><br/><p>Yan Ruiwen started with using Death Spell on Cheng Wei while Cheng Wei instantly resolved it with Purification. He followed up with Seal of God to counter Yan Ruiwen but the latter flexibly moved and evaded it.</p><br/><p>Yu Bing explained calmly, \u201cThe level of both sides isn\u2019t much different. It is obvious that they are trying to test each other and this game might be played slowly\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She hadn\u2019t finished speaking when Yan Ruiwen suddenly used Soul Curse black magic, hitting Cheng Wei and directly reducing his blood by 20%!</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Yu Bing was stunned before quickly reacting. \u201cThe attack by Vice-Captain Yan is truly unexpected. Soul Curse is an instant skill but it doesn\u2019t lock onto the target. A person with quick reactions can move a bit to evade it. Xiao Wei\u2026 is he a bit distracted?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Ruiwen was actually quite surprised. He used this trick but he didn\u2019t expect it to actually hit the opponent.</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei\u2019s status seemed a bit wrong?</p><br/><p>Yan Ruiwen immediately grasped this opportunity. His fingers quickly hit the keyboard and he released Dark Fear.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s another hit!\u201d Kou Hongyi\u2019s tone was very surprised. \u201cCheng Wei is affected by fear for three seconds and is probably very uncomfortable.\u201d</p><br/><p>A player affected by the fear status couldn\u2019t release any skills. This was a single player arena and there were no teammates to help relieve the negative state. Cheng Wei could only rely on moving to avoid the opponent\u2019s attack.</p><br/><p>However, Yan Ruiwen wasn\u2019t a fool. Immediately after the fear hit, he used the ultimate black magic spells\u2014 Shadow Winding and Hell Flames!</p><br/><p>The two spells hit and Cheng Wei\u2019s blood volume directly dropped to 50%!</p><br/><p>The audience watching the game were very confused. Cheng Wei and Yan Ruiwen were at almost the same level. It was reasonable to say that these skills should\u2019ve been avoided. The match had just started yet Cheng Wai was inexplicably beaten to half blood? Where was the expected duel between masters? Why did Cheng Wei seem to be in a trance today?</p><br/><p>The 50% blood Cheng Wei seemed to have finally recovered his spirit. He directly used Sacred Light to improve his magic defense while he used Combat Voice to attack Yan Ruiwen. The success of his pre-judgement meant that he removed 15% of Yan Ruiwen\u2019s blood. This was the standard that Cheng Wei should be at!</p><br/><p>Yu Bing finally sighed with relief. \u201cThere were some surprises in the opening but this is a chance to see how Cheng Wei recovers from the disadvantage.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two sides started to fight with magic. Black magic spells tended to have very strong attack power while white magic spells facoured soft control. One was bright and one was dark, the two people pouring out their spells was very exciting.</p><br/><p>However, Cheng Wei experienced too much of a loss in the beginning. He later tried to recover the situation but Yan Ruiwen was the vice-captain of Wind Colour. His play was very calm and they had a similar level. It was impossible for him to give Cheng Wei an opportunity.</p><br/><p>10 minutes later, Cheng Wei finally fell helplessly and Yan Ruiwen entered the second stage of the arena with 40% of his blood.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>On the Wind Colour side, the black magician Guo Xuan sat in the spectators position and couldn\u2019t help feeling puzzled. \u201cIs Time\u2019s vice-captain not awake?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng frowned slightly. \u201cPerhaps he hasn\u2019t adjusted his state.\u201d</p><br/><p>He knew that Cheng Wei was affected by the news of Canglan\u2019s disbandment. Ling Xuefeng was very clear about the relationship between Li Cangyu and Cheng Wei and he knew that Cheng Wei saw Cat God as his master. This guy must\u2019ve slept badly last night and the game was early in the morning. He was presumably still sleepwalking. It was normal for Yan Ruiwen to seize the opportunity to win since there was no room for distractions in a duel between masters.</p><br/><p>In the second round of the arena, Time sent Lu Hao, who was a main elf archer of the Time team. The 40% blood Yan Ruiwen met Lu Hao and knocked out half of the opponent\u2019s blood before dying, successfully completing his mission.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng didn\u2019t openly praise his vice-captain but looked at him with appreciation.</p><br/><p>Yan Ruiwen smiled and spoke with sitting down, \u201cXiao Cheng played strangely today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng nodded. \u201cI can see that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Ruiwen patted Guo Xuan\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cXiao Guo, it is your turn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, look at me!\u2019 Guo Xuan immediately went to his position.</p><br/><p>Guo Xuan VS Lu Hao, both sides were having a duel using their strengths.</p><br/><p>Guo Xuan was full of blood while Lu Hao had been knocked to half blood by Yan Ruiwen. There was no suspense about the outcome. The two people steadily fought and Guo Xuan successfully killed Lu Hao, bringing Yan Ruiwen\u2019s half blood advantage to the third stage. In other words, the half blooded Guo Xuan was about to face the last defender of the Time team.</p><br/><p>Yu Bing frowned. \u201cThe Time team has lost two players in a row while Wind Colour\u2019s second player Guo Xuan still has 50% blood and the third player hasn\u2019t appeared yet. If the third player is Captain Ling, it will be very difficult for Time to win.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her statement was very polite. If Ling Xuefeng played personally, it didn\u2019t matter if Guo Xuan only gave him a bit of advantage. Ling Xuefeng was almost always the winner when he played guard.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can see that Time\u2019s player is Ten Days, the youngest captain in the league, Tan Shitian!\u201d Kou Hongyi\u2019s voice increased with excitement. \u201cWill Captain Tan make a comeback for his team? Let\u2019s wait and see!\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cThis is Tan Shitian?\u201d</p><br/><p>The player\u2019s appearance was shown at the bottom of the live screen. The young man sitting at the table looked very relaxed. He had a smile on his face and didn\u2019t seem affected by the disadvantage of the previous two players.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu didn\u2019t know this person but after seeing his calm and excellent mentality in the face of a disadvantaged situation, he knew that Captain Xu made the correct decision when he appointed Tan Shitian as Time\u2019s captain. Tan Shitian was much more mature than Cheng Wei.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, Tan Shitian wasn\u2019t affected by the disadvantageous situation and played very calmly.</p><br/><p>His class was a \u2018bard\u2019, also known as an \u2018archer\u2019. Tan Shitian\u2019s debut was late but his reputation was the loudest. His style of play was quite elegant and flexible and he took full advantage of the agility of elves. When he stayed in the distance and kited the opponent with his bow and arrow, his winning percentage was very high.</p><br/><p>Guo Xuan with 50% blood was soon sent off. Time\u2019s Captain Tan Shitian had 70% of his blood left, which was equivalent to recovering 20% blood. This captain\u2019s strength wasn\u2019t normal.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu couldn\u2019t help praising him. \u201cTan Shitian played well.\u201d</p><br/><p>This comment meant that Cat God acknowledged Tan Shitian\u2019s strength.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan couldn\u2019t help glancing over at him. \u201cEven if Tan Shitian recovered a bit of the situation, his health has been reduced and he also consumed a lot of blue. He will die if he faces Ling Xuefeng.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu replied, \u201cHe might not necessarily face Ling Xuefeng.\u201d</p><br/><p>He just finished speaking when Wind Colour revealed their player player. ID: Shepherd, the blood kin summoner Qin Mo!</p><br/><p>The audience was in an uproar.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled at his correct guess.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan reluctantly said, \u201cYou really know Ling Xuefeng!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Li Cangyu honestly admitted it. \u201cWith my understanding of him, he sent Qin Mo to the arena so the group battle will be his double control with Xiao Xu, the black magicians Vice-Captain Yan and Guo Xuan will be the outputs, plus a berserker in the front line and a blood kin sacrifice healer.\u201d</p><br/><p>The arena battle was still ongoing and he actually guessed the lineup of the six member team.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan laughed. \u201cWith your worldly knowledge, the games will be spoiled in advance every time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu touched his chin. \u201cIt is just my guess. I might not necessarily guess right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu said this but Bai Xuan knew that his probability of guessing was almost 100%.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu knew Ling Xuefeng too well. Every time he guessed Ling Xuefeng\u2019s lineup against another team, he would be very accurate. However, every time they met each other, they would guess wrong. It was probably because Ling Xuefeng also understood Li Cangyu very well?</p><br/><p>There was such a strange understanding between them that they couldn\u2019t understand each other.</p><br/><p>From the first season to the third season, Wind Colour and FTD faced each other six times. The two captains kept guessing each other\u2019s thoughts and the result was that they guessed wrong. They never faced each other on the arena!</p><hr/><br/><p>You can also join my discord channel to chat with fellow readers about the novels;</p><hr/><br/>\n</div>"}

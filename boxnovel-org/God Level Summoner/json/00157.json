He didn\u2019t survive long when he met the second Flying Feathers\u2019 pair but he successfully completed his task.</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang walked down with Zhuo Hang and immediately came to Li Cangyu. Li Cangyu patted him on the shoulder and said, \u201cYou played very well. You should believe in yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang immediately nodded. \u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang also said, \u201cXiaojiang is amazing. Your progress is particularly fast.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan suddenly interjected. \u201cIt is really rare. This is the first time I\u2019ve heard Xiao Zhuo praising someone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong immediately agreed. \u201cYes, Xiao Zhuo never praised us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang blushed and scratched his head. Li Xiaojiang consciously sat down next to him.</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang was unable to calm down after the game just now. He saw the excitement in Li Xiaojiang\u2019s eyes and felt that in the days to come, it would be excellent if he could keep having Li Xiaojiang as a partner.</p><br/><p>Why did he dislike Li Xiaojiang when they first started? Xiaojiang tried so hard and his red face as he stuttered was cute. What was Zhuo Hang thinking at that time?</p><br/><p>In the future, he must be good and cooperate with Li Xiaojiang. Zhuo Hang secretly made this promise as he held Li Xiaojiang\u2019s hand. The latter turned to Zhuo Hang with a confused look. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang smiled and said, \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>In his heart, he was thinking that it was wonderful to sit next to the slow Li Xiaojiang. Zhuo Hang believed that he and Xiaojiang would become the league\u2019s best combination.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>On the field, Flying Feathers sent Cao Lang and Xiao Mu as the next pair. It was a blood kin assassin and a terran priest.</p><br/><p>Cao Lang was known as the \u2018head harvester\u2019 and his ability to find opportunities was extremely strong. Xiao Mu was the only terran priest of the MIracle League and his survival ability wasn\u2019t lacking compared to Bai Xuan. The combination of this two people would be very hard.</p><br/><p>As it happened, Li Xiaojiang was out and the second pair from Canglan was Xiao Han and Zhang Jueming. It was the blood kin assassin and white magician combination!</p><br/><p>This way, the two sides formed an assassin and auxiliary combination match.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu didn\u2019t partner with his apprentice and sent Old Zhang instead. Yu Bing\u2019s explanation was, \u201cCat God doesn\u2019t want to go out. He sent an auxiliary as Xiao Han\u2019s partner. It is probably to test Xiao Han\u2019s independent thinking and flexibility.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her explanation was acknowledge by the Canglan fans. They now thoroughly understood Cat God\u2019s thinking when sending people. He wanted to train new people while gaining points.</p><br/><p>He played the first two games with Xiao Han. This time, he saw that Xiao Han was in good shape and didn\u2019t play, sending him with an auxiliary instead.</p><br/><p>Xiao Han naturally wouldn\u2019t let his master down. In a fight between assassins, winning or losing depended on grasping the right timing.</p><br/><p>The other side\u2019s healer was really strong and he could easily add blood back. However, Uncle Zhang\u2019s white magician wasn\u2019t weak. He could control the opponents at key moments and help Xiao Han complete big moves.</p><br/><p>Kou Hongyi saw this matchup and sighed. \u201cThe attackers are assassins while there is an auxiliary and healer. This should be a protracted battle and take at least 10 minutes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Bing added, \u201cIn a slow battle, it depends on who is more patient and is able to seize more opportunities.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the truth.\u201d Kou Hongyi went on, \u201cA quick fight is difficult as long as the healer doesn\u2019t die. It will obviously become a protracted battle and it depends on whether the two sides have the patience to grind down their opponents.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>In the Wind Colour training room, Qin Mo couldn\u2019t help opening his mouth to ask, \u201cIn a protracted battle, Xiao Han has less experience. Isn\u2019t he likely to lose?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng replied, \u201cNot necessarily. Xiao Han\u2019s mentality is excellent and he might be able to find a chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mo didn\u2019t feel that Xiao Han could win against Cao Lang but he hoped that Xiao Han could play to his true level.</p><br/><p>This arena game really turned in a protracted battle like Kou Hongyi said. The two sides jumped back and forth on the vast sea and didn\u2019t rush to act. This made people feel sleepy.</p><br/><p>The reason why Cao Lang wasn\u2019t anxious was because he knew that the white magician could release skills from a distance. If he got close to kill Xiao Han, Zhang Jueming would definitely control him. Therefore, Cao Lang wanted to find a better time to act.</p><br/><p>Xiao Han was also very patient. The other side didn\u2019t act and he wasn\u2019t in a hurry either. Uncle Zhang adjusted their positioning and he started to tentatively attack the opponent.</p><br/><p>Once the standoff lasted for three minutes, Canglan\u2019s auxiliary moved first!</p><br/><p>God\u2019s Seal emerged from Zhang Jueming\u2019s hands. This was the white magician\u2019s skill to fix a body in place. The spell accurately fell on Cao Lang\u2019s body and he couldn\u2019t move.</p><br/><p>Xiao Han seized this opportunity and immediately moved behind Cao Lang, using Death Mark, Backstab, Fatal Blow and Absorb and Seize the Soul!</p><br/><p>This combo caused Cao Lang\u2019s blood to instantly fall to 40%!</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that Xiao Han\u2019s output was terrible. It was because Zhang Jueming accurately grasped the timing and used the white magician\u2019s skill to enhance his teammate\u2019s attack, Inspiring Voice. This doubled his partner\u2019s attack for five seconds!</p><br/><p>Xiao Han took advantage of this support skill to unleash a scary amount of damage, causing Cao Lang to fall belong half blood in one breath.</p><br/><p>Xiao Mu saw Cao Lang\u2019s blood and immediately used the terran priest\u2019s strongest single target healing skill, Holy Light Surge.</p><br/><p>Holy Light Surge restored a certain percentage of blood. It instantly added 60% blood in critical situations.</p><br/><p>Such a big move naturally had a very long cooldown time. It was more than 50 seconds and the consumption of blue was also huge. The advantage was that he could rescue his teammate from near death. Xiao Mu was obviously worried that a second combo would kill Cao Lang and decisively used the big move.</p><br/><p>To the surprise of the audience, the gorgeous skill was released but Cao Lang\u2019s blood was only raised by 20%.</p><br/><p>Yu Bing immediately explained, \u201cWe can see that Xiao Mu\u2019s big skill only added 20% blood to his teammates. This is because Zhang Jueming used a skill at the critical moment, Purification.\u201d</p><br/><p>She made a gesture and the screen opened a small window in the lower left that had a replay. \u201cYou might be curious. Doesn\u2019t the Purification skill remove negative states and makes the person immune to control?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei watched the game on the TV and immediately said, \u201cThat is the regular options. It can add something else!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sure enough, Yu Bing also said, \u201cThis is normal for output white magicians. However, Zhang Jueming\u2019s white magician took the auxiliary route. The special effects of Purification isn\u2019t quite the same. He abandoned the lifting negative states effect but added a substantial reduction in the healing amount. In the team battle, this can greatly reduce the effect of healing in a key moment, allowing his teammates to break out and kill a person.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kou Hongyi suddenly realized. \u201cNo wonder. The white magician auxiliary build died out a long time ago in the Miracle League. This contestant is very different from the white magicians we normally see. Xiao Mu is probably shocked. This is equivalent to wasting a healer\u2019s big move!\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>On the field, Uncle Zhang decisively used a skill to offset the healer\u2019s big move. Xiao Han was happy and continued to release three skills, forcing Cao Lang\u2019s blood to 30% in one breath.</p><br/><p>Cao Lang naturally didn\u2019t stand still. He escaped the control effect and immediately attacked Xiao Han. However, Xiao Han didn\u2019t struggle with him and turned quickly to escape.</p><br/><p>The audience was a bit puzzled but Li Cangyu was relieved. Xiao Han was really clever.</p><br/><p>Cao Lang had a healer and his blood could be restored. Xiao Han had an auxiliary and his blood couldn\u2019t be restored. He knew that he couldn\u2019t kill Cao Lang this time and decisively retreated, once again waiting for another opportunity.</p><br/><p>Uncle Zhang had offset the healer\u2019s big move, making Xiao Mu use more blood adding skills to recover Cao Lang\u2019s blood. His blue amount fell to 50%.</p><br/><p>For a healer, the blue was the key, not blood!</p><br/><p>There was no reason to fear a healer who had no blue, even if they were full of blood.</p><br/><p>Xiao Han was smart and understood it was a battle of attrition. He forced the healer to use a big move, controlled the healer\u2019s cooldown time and made the healer consume a large amount of blue. Once Xiao Mu ran out of blue, he couldn\u2019t add anymore blood and killing Cao Lang would become easier.</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming\u2019s role was key but Xiao Han\u2019s reaction was fast enough to grasp his teammate\u2019s intention.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Xiao Mu\u2019s survival ability was very strong but Xiao Han didn\u2019t attack him at all. Instead, he struck Cao Lang and made Xiao Mu consume his blue. This feeling was very uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>It appeared that Xiao Mu and Cao Lang were full of blood but experienced professional players knew that Xiao Han and Zhang Jueming were using the map to look for opportunities. Their wave of attacks would make things more difficult for Xiao Mu.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Cao Lang\u2019s reaction wasn\u2019t slow. He understood the other side\u2019s intentions and chased Xiao Han to consume Xiao Han\u2019s blood.</p><br/><p>Consuming blood while consuming blue. The result was that Xiao Mu was almost empty of blue while Xiao Han had residual blood.</p><br/><p>At this critical moment, Zhang Jueming acted again. Song of the Soul!</p><br/><p>A soft sound filled the venue accompanied by the white magician\u2019s holy light effect. This was the white magician\u2019s strong control skill. Like its name, Song of the Soul put the opponent to sleep!</p><br/><p>Cao Lang fell asleep and couldn\u2019t use any skills. Xiao Han grasped this opportunity and used a series of attack skills.</p><br/><p>He saw Cao Lang was waking up and didn\u2019t hesitate to use Pain Blade to make Cao Lang dizzy.</p><br/><p>This continuous control made Cao Lang\u2019s blood fall to 10% instantly!</p><br/><p>Cao Lang\u2019s control effect finally ended and he used an attack that couldn\u2019t be avoided. Xiao Han also used an attack skill and the two residual blood players fell to the ground at the same time.</p><br/><p>[Frost Descends has killed Bright Clear Sky!]</p><br/><p>[Bright Clear Sky has killed Frost Descends!]</p><br/><p>This result made many audience members surprised. In front of the TV, Qin Mo\u2019s eyes widened. He didn\u2019t expect that Xiao Han could actually kill a first-class assassin in the league!</p><br/><p>There was the factor of the auxiliary\u2019s assistance but as a newcomer, Xiao Han\u2019s performance made the audience clap!</p><br/><p>The mixed-race teenager had white skin and his hair was gold. His eyelashes were long and he was very good-looking. After this battle, the number of fans on Xiao Han\u2019s Weibo rose by tens of thousands.</p><br/><p>At this time, Xiao Mu and Zhang Jueming were embarrassed as they faced each other on the sea.</p><br/><p>Xiao Mu was full of blood and empty of blue. Zhang Jueming was also full of blood and empty of blue. How could they fight?</p><br/><p>A healer and auxiliary who couldn\u2019t use skills had to face each other?</p><br/><p>The camera cleverly zoomed in to both sides\u2019 blood gauge and laughter filled the veue. Zhang Jueming also smiled and typed: [Shall we go down together?]</p><br/><p>Xiao Mu helplessly agreed: [Okay.]</p><br/><p>The referee had no objection to their decision. The two men didn\u2019t have any skills and didn\u2019t need to continue fighting. Such a situation was judged as a draw.</p><br/><p>The result was that the two full blood players stood up and left the contestant seats at the same time.</p><br/><p>On the way back to the team, Zhang Jueming patted Xiao Han\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cExcellent cooperation!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han also said, \u201cUncle Zhang, you played very handsome.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming laughed. \u201cOf course! However, played very handsome is a bit strange. You should directly say that I was very handsome.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han seriously corrected himself. \u201cUncle Zhang, you were very handsome!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu saw them come back and raised his thumbs. There was no need to talk about Zhang Jueming. The old player was very reliable in critical moments. The rare thing was that Xiao Han could adapt to Zhang Jueming. Xiao Han had certainly gained a lot of experience from this, making Li Cangyu satisfied.</p><br/><p>Next was the critical third round.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong stood up. \u201cIt is my turn to be handsome on the stage.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan helplessly asked, \u201cCan\u2019t you change your lines?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong touched his chin and said, \u201cThis line suits my temperament. I won\u2019t change it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This guy\u2019s shamelessness was too big!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

For today\u2019s post-match interview, Li Cangyu decided to bring all eight members of the Canglan team to say hello to the local reporters.</p><br/><p>The reporters were excited when they unexpectedly saw all eight players coming into the interview room. They stood up and applauded the players. The photographers kept pressing the shutter button for fear of missing this wonderful moment.</p><br/><p>The host responsible for maintaining order took the microphone and said, \u201cReporters, the time for asking questions is only 15 minutes. I hope that everyone can prepare the key questions in advance for the players to answer. The post-match interview of the Canglan team is now starting.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as these words were heard, a female reporter stood up and asked Li Cangyu, \u201cCat God, you played a 2:1 game at home today. This is definitely due to your careful arrangements. Did you calculate all of this before the game?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu took the microphone and replied honestly, \u201cThe order of the first arena game was decided before the match but the second and third games were decided on the spot. During the one week preparation time, we practiced a variety of combinations. Then today I made corresponding adjustments based on the performance of several players.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporter asked, \u201cWhat are the specific adjustments?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu replied, \u201cIt has long been decided that Zhuo Hang and Li Xiaojiang would play all three games. Today I adjusted the appearance of the other combinations. The cooperation between Xiao Han and Old Zhang was also a temporary decision. It is because at the end of the second round, I felt that Xiao Han was in good shape and felt reassured about letting him go with an auxiliary.\u201d</p><br/><p>The female reporter asked another question. \u201cCat God, did you think that it might\u2019ve been possible to get a 3:0 score if you played in the third game?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is hard. I used my wind spirit once and no professional player would make the same mistakes in a row. In my opinion, I would\u2019ve played similarly to Ah Shu.\u201d Li Cangyu paused and explained seriously, \u201cBesides, Ah Shu\u2019s state is excellent. He has more understanding of the opponents and also needs opportunities to train his cooperation with Vice-Captain Bai. I don\u2019t think I made a mistake. A 2:1 score is similar to my expectations.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou had Ah Shu play three games in a row? Weren\u2019t you worried that he would make a mistake when facing his brothers? Or weren\u2019t you worried about affecting the feelings between brothers?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled. \u201cI wasn\u2019t worried about that at all. Ah Shu is a very good professional player. All team members should try their best on the field. This is the most basic quality of a professional player. I believed he could absolutely do it\u2026 As for the relationship between brothers, I think that Captain Su, Vice-Captain Yu and Ah Shu aren\u2019t so stingy. A match is a competition and a personal relationship is a personal relationship. Professional players should be able to distinguish between it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Cat God.\u201d The female reporter got her answers and sat down politely. She couldn\u2019t help giving a thumbs up to Cat God in her heart. This was her first interview with Li Cangyu and she found that this man was very serious when answering all questions. Moreover, he could calmly cope with hard questions.</p><br/><p>This was followed by a young male reporter standing up. \u201cIn the last match against Time, it was Cat God\u2019s Cataclysm that turned the tide at the crucial moment. Today you summoned the wind spirit in a key moment to directly kill the other side\u2019s healer. Cat God, how many secret weapons do you have left?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled slightly. \u201cThere are many things that will be slowly pulled out in future games.\u201d</p><br/><p>The captains in front of the TV really wanted to beat him up. There were many more things? How many times was he going to pit them?</p><br/><p>\u201cIs Cat God going to pick more arena games at home matches?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot necessarily. It will be according to the opponent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about Wind Colour?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu grinned. \u201cAre you an undercover sent by Ling Xuefeng? This must not be revealed in advance!\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd laughed while the reporter who asked the question blushed and sat down. There were no frivolous answers from Cat God\u2019s mouth. He was an old captain who led the team for many years and knew how to answer every question.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to ask the new members. What is your biggest feeling from today\u2019s match?\u201d A female reporter with a ponytail changed the topic to the newcomers. Gu Siming immediately took the microphone and replied, \u201cMy biggest feeling is that it is boring to play soy sauce. I also want to play.\u201d</p><br/><p>Laughter filled the venue. The reporters were deeply sympathetic to Xiao Gu who had to watch from the sidelines the whole time.</p><br/><p>Gu Siming pointed to himself and said, \u201cEveryone can take a few more photos. I didn\u2019t play today but you can\u2019t miss me when writing the articles!\u201d</p><br/><p>The photographers pointed the camera at him and found that this baby-faced man was quite good.</p><br/><p>The reporter continued asking, \u201cZhuo Hang? What is your harvest from today\u2019s match?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang smiled slightly as he took the microphone and faced the reporters. \u201cThis game allowed me to learn many things. My performance wasn\u2019t perfect, especially in the second game. I didn\u2019t calculate the skill damage and I have to be more careful in the future. I feel there is still a lot of room for improvement and I will continue to work hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters cooperated to give him some applause. He might be young but they liked his calm appearance.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Han? Is there anything you want to say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han took the microphone from Zhuo Hang and said, \u201cMaster told me I played well. I also felt that I played 666.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>They stared at Xiao Han with a dull expression.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu suppressed his laugh and reminded Xiao Han, \u201cVery few people will use 666 to describe themselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han immediately changed it. \u201cI played very well.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Mixed-race child, can\u2019t you save your Chinese?\u2019</p><br/><p>Everyone suppressed their smiles. A strange feeling grew inside them as they listened to his nonsense.</p><br/><p>Qin Mo saw the interview and immediately had a headache. He cried out in his heart, \u2018Don\u2019t tell anyone that I am teaching you Chinese! I don\u2019t have a student like you!\u2019</p><br/><p>Xiao Han\u2019s Weibo was blowing up. [Xiao Han, you are really 6!] [Young man, who taught you the language? Kick him away and learn from me!] [It is great. I\u2019ve learned a new expression.] [Xiao Han, you are really great!]</p><br/><p>Xiao Han noticed the reporters\u2019 expressions and realized he said the wrong words. He scratched his head with embarrassment and handed the microphone to Li Xiaojiang.</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang stammered, \u201cI am, I am very happy today. I could kill, kill a person alone on the field. The captain gave me more, more confidence. I will, will continue to work hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters listened to his serious answer and clapped in encouragement.</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang\u2019s face reddened. \u201cThank, thank, thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Other people said it once but this boy had to say it many times.</p><br/><p>Many reporters felt that the Canglan team was full of style. The four newcomers each had their own characteristics and interviewing them was particularly interesting. They wanted to talk to the members all night but unfortunately, the interview time was limited.</p><br/><p>Once all four teenagers answered the questions, a reporter aimed a question at Zhang Jueming. \u201cOld Zhang, your auxiliary white magician is currently the only one in the Miracle League. What made you stick with it to the present?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming answered enthusiastically, \u201cIt is probably because of my stubbornness! The white magician output is the mainstream style for professional players but I wanted to play an auxiliary. In any case, I am back again after so many years have passed. I didn\u2019t want to change myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters admired him. \u201cYou control and status enhancement skills were quite accurate today in key moments. It turns out that a white magician auxiliary can also play a big role.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming laughed. \u201cRight? I also feel that I am very handsome today!\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Was the boasting of the Canglan team contagious? Old Zhang learnt it as well? Fortunately, Cat God still maintained his integrity!</p><br/><p>\u201cVice-Captain Bai played three games in a row with Ah Shu today? How do you feel? Please evaluate your partner.\u201d A reporter stood up and asked Bai Xuan.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan smiled and said, \u201cThe first feeling is that I am very tired. I played three games and couldn\u2019t maintain my state well. The rhythm of my healing couldn\u2019t keep up with the speed of the opposite side\u2019s output. This is the key to losing the last match.\u201d</p><br/><p>He took the initiative to take all blame. Xie Shurong pinched his hand under the table and whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t say this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan glanced at Xie Shurong and kept talking, \u201cIf I have to evaluate my partner, I think that Ah Shu is\u2026 he might be a bit childish and shameless but he is very reliable in key moments. He is a partner that all team members can trust.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong was happy about being praised and held Bai Xuan\u2019s hand tightly under the table.</p><br/><p>A reporter followed up with, \u201cWhat about Ah Shu? How do you evaluate Vice-Captain Bai?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong spoke without hesitation. \u201cI think that Vice-Captain Bai is a gentle, considerate and careful person. No matter in life or on the field, he will make his teammates feel particularly comfortable. As a healer, his survivability is very high and his blood adding technique is powerful. I feel that I have 10 lives when I\u2019m with him on the battlefield.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d The embarrassed Bai Xuan interrupted him. \u201cCough, you are boasting too much. It is almost over.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters laughed while Xie Shurong smiled. \u201cIn fact, no words can describe how good Bai Xuan is. In my heart, he is the perfect partner.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan blushed and couldn\u2019t help thinking, \u2018Ah Shu\u2019s boasting technique is first-class. He always exaggerates and his mouth is as sweet as honey. Doesn\u2019t he feel numb?\u2019</p><br/><p>In fact, Xie Shurong\u2019s words came from deep in his heart.</p><br/><p>It was impossible to describe Bai Xuan\u2019s strengths, let along express Xie Shurong\u2019s affection towards him.</p><br/><p>It was the so-called \u2018in the eyes of the beholder\u2019. In Xie Shurong\u2019s opinion, Bai Xuan was the best existence in the world.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

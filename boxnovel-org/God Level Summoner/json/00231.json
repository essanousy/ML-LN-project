Dinner was booked at a Chinese restaurant on the third floor of the hotel. Everyone had dinner together and it was a perfect ending for the seventh season.</p><br/><p>The players who got a trophy were naturally very happy. Players who didn\u2019t win awards quickly adjusted their mood. After all, this was the end of a season. There would be an eighth season next year waiting for everyone to continue their efforts.</p><br/><p>The six month race made the players exhausted. According to the practices of the previous years, the off-season of the Miracle League would occur. All professional players would get a two months holiday. They were free to arrange a holiday, accompany their family or go on a trip.</p><br/><p>This year was very different from previous years because the World Competition was going to start in October. This meant the great gods wouldn\u2019t have much time to rest and needed to be ready to take on the serious world event.</p><br/><p>At the dinner party, the chairman Nan Jiangang didn\u2019t mention the topic of the World Competition. Instead, he summarized the seventh season and let everyone eat well, drink well and rest well.</p><br/><p>The impatient Cheng Wei couldn\u2019t help wondering, \u201cWhat about the World Competition? Why is the chairman so calm? What about the national team?\u201d</p><br/><p>After seeing that he was about to run and ask the chairman, Tan Shitian immediately pressed down on his shoulder and made him sit down. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. The rules of the national team\u2019s selection shouldn\u2019t come out yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei was puzzled as he sat down. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian patiently explained, \u201cThe World Competition will definitely attract widespread attention from the media. The selection of the national team has to be fair and just or the league will be scolded to death. The chairman must still be hesitant about the specific selection plan. After the plan is decided, the league will definitely announce it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei remembered all the curses on the Internet and exclaimed, \u201cYes! If the league directly chooses the team members, people will say we relied on relationships to go through the back door. It would be really annoying! A direct public selection is more reliable. We will speak with strength!\u201d He shook his fist. \u201cI want to enter the national team!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian saw his vow and couldn\u2019t help smiling, whispering into his ears, \u201cIf only one white magician is chosen, can you win against Vice-Captain Yang Muzi?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei was stunned. He and Vice-Captain Yang Muzi hadn\u2019t fought alone against each other for a long time. He might not necessarily win against her. However, he already said the big words and had to continue with his swollen face, \u201cI-I should be able to win against her!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian\u2019s stomach was sore. This guy was really pure. How could he believe that the league would only send one white magician? The national team wasn\u2019t the second Time team. It was impossible for there to be only one white magician.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei wasn\u2019t the only one anxious. At the next table, Zhang Shaohui couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cWhat time is this? Why hasn\u2019t the national team been formed or even a plan determined. Is the league so inefficient? I don\u2019t know how many assassins\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang heard his muttering and glanced at him, \u201cWhat\u2019s the hurry? Let\u2019s wait and see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui had a bitter expression. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that there will only be one assassin. What if our combination is broken\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang asked, \u201cWhat if there really is only one spot?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui scratched his head and smiled. \u201cThen you go. Your strength is better than me and you are a commander. I will come and cheer you on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang heard this and showed a rare smile.</p><br/><p>This person always gave the opportunity to Lou Wushuang. Every time his parents bought delicious fruit, he would take the initiative to give it to Lou Wushuang, saying with a smile, \u201cBrother, eat first.\u201d In the voting for the last world competition, he gave up his ticket and had Ghost Spirits fans vote for the captain. Now he would also give away his opportunity for the World Competition\u2026</p><br/><p>All professional players wanted to go to the World competition. It was a wider and more exciting stage.</p><br/><p>Going out of the country and playing against the big gods from other countries should be the dream of every Miracle e-sports player.</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui actually wanted to give the opportunity to his brother. Lou Wushuang was touched by this silly younger brother. He gently gripped his brother\u2019s hand with a soft expression. \u201cLet\u2019s go together. There should be more than one assassin quota.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui immediately became excited. \u201cI also hope there are two spots! Then I can go with my brother and sneak kill the world\u2019s top players!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang couldn\u2019t help smiling at his giggling brother. His teammates glanced at each other. Captain, what about your iceberg male image? How did you suddenly become soft today? This style was too wrong!</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>On the Flying Feathers side, Su Guangmo wasn\u2019t in a hurry. He calmly picked vegetables to eat. Yu Pingsheng was a person who didn\u2019t like to talk. He just ate on his own and didn\u2019t seem to care about the World Competition.</p><br/><p>The vice-captain didn\u2019t speak and the other team members didn\u2019t say much.</p><br/><p>Yang Muzi, vice-captain of the Red Fox team, couldn\u2019t help feeling concerned. \u201cSister Xiang, how many healers will the national team have? If there is only one, is it possible for Vice-Captain Bai to be directly selected?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiang smiled and replied very gracefully, \u201cHis healing is very accurate. I will be convinced if he is selected for the national team. It is like the deciding game in the finals. I certainly wouldn\u2019t be able to sacrifice myself for my teammate. The overall situation of Vice-Captain Bai is stronger than me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Muzi wasn\u2019t convinced. \u201cSister Xiang is being too modest. You have a different style. I think his emergency healing is indeed better but in large groups, your ability is obviously stronger than him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Jie, the straightforward female warriors, told them, \u201cI have a sense that the national team\u2019s lineup should be very big.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiang was doubtful. \u201cWhy do you think this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Jie smiled. \u201cThe Miracle League has been going for eight years. In many countries, the professional leagues have been running for at least seven years. The first World Competition will definitely have a lot of noise or many Miracle fans in the world will be angry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiang nodded thoughtfully. \u201cIt makes sense. If there is an open selection then we will have to sign up and let foreigners look at the style of Chinese women.\u201d</p><br/><p>The team members immediately agreed. \u201cOf course we will all try!\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was very calm compared to the anxious attitude of the players of other teams.</p><br/><p>Regardless of how the national team was selected, his quota was absolutely certain. The captain of the championship team was directly appointed as captain of the national team. This was the rule that the Miracle World League had long set.</p><br/><p>In other words, the captain would be Li Cangyu, no matter who was selected for the national team.</p><br/><p>The Canglan team was very happy. Bai Xuan exclaimed, \u201cOur Cat God will be the captain of the national team!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong asked curiously, \u201cWhat about the vice-captain? Will Vice-Captain Bai directly become vice-captain of the national team?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cProbably not.\u201d Li Cangyu replied. \u201cThe specific plan hasn\u2019t come out yet. Xiao Bai, do you want to be vice-captain?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have the energy and my body can\u2019t afford it. Forget it.\u201d Bai Xuan smiled. \u201cIn fact, you should have a more suitable person in your heart, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han asked seriously, \u201cIs Captain Ling the person in Master\u2019s heart?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Can really wanted to hit him. This apprentice, selling his master?</p><br/><p>Everyone around them made a \u2018it turns out to be like this\u2019 expression.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu touched his nose guiltily and pretended to be calm. \u201cCough, Xiao Bai doesn\u2019t want to do it. Then I think Ling Xuefeng is really suitable for this position. It needs to be discussed with the chairman before it is decided.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone nodded in unison. \u201cOh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu wondered, \u201cWhat\u2019s with your expressions?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han replied seriously, \u201cMaster doesn\u2019t have to explain. We all understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Understand a fart! What did they know?</p><br/><p>Gu Siming seemed to understand and explained while scratching his head. \u201cThe strongest opponent has become the strongest partner. This is a very magical story!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang smiled. \u201cOnce Cat God and Captain Ling joins hands, it is estimated that the other countries will have to kneel before them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong strongly agreed. \u201cThe American team\u2019s Jack Josh has always been arrogant. He said many times that he is the world\u2019s best summoner. Once Cat God joins forces with Captain Ling, he will have to cry and will see what a real summoner is!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled slightly. \u201cDon\u2019t brag. There are many excellent players in other countries. Of course, I am looking forward to joining forces with Ling Xuefeng in the World Competition.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng seemed to be aware they were talking about him as he turned and looked at Li Cangyu, just in time to meet Li Cangyu\u2019s gaze. Li Cangyu smiled at him and Ling Xuefeng walked over. \u201cAre you looking for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>We were just talking about you. What are you doing here?</p><br/><p>The Canglan players smiled and endured their stomach pains. They saw their captain\u2019s expression and suddenly felt that Captain Ling truly was Cat God\u2019s nemesis?</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>At the end of the dinner, Chairman Nan finally fulfilled everyone\u2019s expectations by picking up the microphone. \u201cAll players, the seventh season has been successfully completed but we are waiting for the World Competition in October!\u201d</p><br/><p>The players immediately pricked their ears as they heard the keyword \u2018World Competition\u2019.</p><br/><p>Chairman Nan smiled. \u201cYou must be very keen to know the selection rules for the national team. However, it is the national team and we will have to face the top players of each country in the future. The team\u2019s lineup can\u2019t be hastily decided. Go back and wait for the notice. By tomorrow night at the latest, the league will definitely release a detailed selection plan.</p><br/><p>The players, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was very anxious but the chairman\u2019s words were correct. The selection rules for the national team had to be carefully considered. Hasty people don\u2019t get to eat hot tofu. They had to wait for the league\u2019s notice.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

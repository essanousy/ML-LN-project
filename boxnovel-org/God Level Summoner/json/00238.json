Li Cangyu returned to Changsha with the other members of Canglan and unexpectedly saw two friends at the door of the Dragon Song Club.</p><br/><p>They were the original members of the Canglan team, Luo Zilong and Huo Jie, who haven\u2019t been seen in a year. Li Cangyu saw the two men and greeted them with excitement, hugging his two good friends. \u201cLong time no see!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan also walked over and asked with a smile. \u201cAh Long, Ah Jie, what are you going here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that you have been selected for the national team, congratulations!\u201d Luo Ziling said as he handed two boxes to them. They were hollow metal ornaments of Li Cangyu and Bai Xuan\u2019s characters in the game. They were also engraved with words. Li Cangyu\u2019s one said \u2018the elf summoner will win\u2019 while Bai Xuan\u2019s priest said \u2018World-class god milk!\u2019</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu couldn\u2019t help laughing. \u201cYou are really considerate.\u201d</p><br/><p>He asked Old Zhang to bring the players into the club while he and Bai Xuan took his two old friends to a nearby restaurant to chat.</p><br/><p>After the disbandment of Canglan, all teammates except for Li Cangyu and Bai Xuan had left the e-sports circle. Luo Zilong had returned to his hometown to become a civil servant, marrying and having a son. Huo Jie went to his father\u2019s food factory to help. They all had an ordinary but peaceful life, no longer needing to worry about playing the game every day.</p><br/><p>They could each find their own home. Li Cangyu was naturally very pleased and patted the shoulders of both people. \u201cIt seems that you have a good life. I can finally rest assured.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Zilong rubbed his eyes and whispered, \u201cIn fact, we have been reflecting after the disbandment. In the past few years, we dragged down both of you. Perhaps the two of you would\u2019ve already won the championship\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan smiled. \u201cShould you say this? The team was built by all of us. Our results might not be good in recent years but we all worked together. There is nothing to regret.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huo Jie protested, \u201cBut\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you treat me as a brother, don\u2019t say such things again.\u201d Li Cangyu interrupted. \u201cThe fact that you are following the competition shows that you still really like it. Everyone has a limited ability. A player who hasn\u2019t won a prize isn\u2019t necessarily a bad player. After two days, I will leave for the national team training. I am really happy to see you before the training.\u201d</p><br/><p>His sincere eyes made the two of them stop talking about it. They chatted about what happened after leaving the e-sports circle.</p><br/><p>Their days have indeed become calmer and stable. Every day they would go to work then go home to take care of their wife and children, like many of their peers around them. There might be no special achievements but they didn\u2019t have to worry about losing their job.</p><br/><p>It was just that they couldn\u2019t forget the heated blood and excitement of the league and Li Cangyu. It was the most precious thing they buried in the depths of their memories and would never be forgotten.</p><br/><p>Today, Li Cangyu was the captain of the Chinese Miracle national team and Bai Xuan was also selected. This could be regarded as a substitute for the small group\u2019s unfinished dream.</p><br/><p>Luo Zilong suddenly grabbed Li Cangyu\u2019s hand and said, \u201cYou must refuel for the World Competition. We will watch every game. If you enter the finals, I will take my wife and child to the United States to cheer you on!\u201d</p><br/><p>Huo Jie also said, \u201cI might not be able to go abroad because I\u2019m too busy lately but I will cheer for you in front of the TV.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled. \u201cRest assured. We will try our best.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu\u2019s heart was really warm at receiving the encouragement of old friends.</p><br/><p>Perhaps in the eyes of many people, it was just a waste for him to play with the ordinary players in the game. However, for Li Cangyu, it was very meaningful to work with his good brothers for a common goal. He didn\u2019t regret his original choice at all.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>After returning to the team, Li Cangyu lay in bed and couldn\u2019t fall asleep. He picked up his phone and sent a message to Ling Xuefeng: [Today my old friends and former teammates came to Changsha to find me.]</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng replied in seconds: [What did they say?]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu: [The congratulated me for becoming captain of the national team and cheered me on.]</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng: [It seems they are quite loyal. Despite retiring, they paid attention to the competitions you participated in.]</p><br/><p>This sentence made Li Cangyu\u2019s mood improve. [Yes, in fact, several of them are very good people. Their level wasn\u2019t high enough for the competition. This is a matter of talent and there is no way to force it.]</p><br/><p>He was pleased that Ling Xuefeng could understand his feelings towards these friends instead of questioning him.</p><br/><p>A few years of wind and rain had passed. Now he won the championship and was serving as the captain of the national team, as well as having a strong partner like Ling Xuefeng to assist him. He believed that on the stage of the World Competition, the Chinese team would definitely give the opponents a surprise!</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng knew this person couldn\u2019t sleep. He turned on the voice chat and whispered, \u201cIf you can\u2019t sleep, do you want to analyze the characteristics of players from various countries?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was instantly spirited. \u201cGood!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng told him, \u201cLet\u2019s start with the American team\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The two people started to talk until around midnight. Then Ling Xuefeng hung up to let Li Cangyu sleep.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The next morning, a special visitor came to the Dragon Song Club. It was a female reporter with her hair in a ponytail. The simple white dress made her look fresh and capable. She introduced herself, \u201cHello Cat God, I am Zhao Yue, the reporter for the national team. This is the photographer Zhou Yang.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu looked at her doubtfully because he felt this reporter was a bit familiar.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan whispered to him as a reminder, \u201cIn every post-match interview, her questions are very straightforward and sharp.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu suddenly realized and smiled at her. \u201cMiss Zhao came to our Dragon Song Club. Is it an official interview task from the league?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Yue explained simply, \u201cI need an exclusive interview with the captain of the national team. This was a task the league arranged.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu nodded. \u201cPlease come this way.\u201d</p><br/><p>He took the two people to the office of the Dragon Song Club. The photographer held his camera and Zhao Yue asked him, \u201cCat God, do you want to change your clothes?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu looked at his simple t-shirt. \u201cDo I need to change it? This should be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cat God wasn\u2019t the same as Captain Ling and didn\u2019t like to wear formal clothes. Since he wanted to be free, Zhao Yue didn\u2019t hesitate and turned on her recorder pen to start the interview. \u201cYou have won the championship and five of your players are selected for the national team. Cat God is a really good captain. Were there any strategies when training your team?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI developed a personal training program for each person\u2019s characteristics and weaknesses. The four newcomers had different training tasks every day and this arrangement had a better effect.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Yue then asked, \u201cWill you continue this method of training in the national team?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled and shook his head. \u201cThe national team is different. The foundation of Canglan\u2019s four newcomers wasn\u2019t good and some of them encountered a bottleneck. I needed to think of a method to help them break through that bottleneck. The national team players are different. Everyone is top-notch and there is no need to strengthen their personal standards. Teamwork is more important for the national team.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Yue wondered, \u201cIs it because everyone comes from different teams?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Li Cangyu explained, \u201cEvery team has a different style and the great gods of different teams will have to adapt to each other. That\u2019s why the national team will go to a secret training camp, helping everyone became one as soon as possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWith so many great gods together, there is bound to be a difference in opinion. What will you do then?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu answered, \u201cI will use their opinions as a reference but the final plan is decided by me and Ling Xuefeng. Otherwise, won\u2019t the national team be a mess?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Yue nodded in agreement. \u201cIn the domestic league, every team has distinctive features, such as Ghost Spirits\u2019 assassination tactics or Time\u2019s kiting. However, the national team only has two or three of each class. Is the national team going to abandon the original tactics like assassination and kiting?\u201d</p><br/><p>This question was the key point. In order to consider the overall lineup, the national team was balanced when choosing players. The result was that some extreme tactics couldn\u2019t be achieved.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu thought about it before replying. \u201cI have discussed it with Xuefeng and received the approval of the chairman. Apart from us, the national team will have four mobile commanders, namely Tan Shitian, Lou Wushuang, Su Guangmo and Chu Yan. Captain Tan will be mainly responsible for the kite flow tactics, Captain Lou will be in charge of the assassin based lineup, the melee violent play will be handed over to Captain Su and Chu Yan will deal with the European illusionists. I can\u2019t command every game with Xuefeng. These great gods will be in charge when necessary.\u201d</p><br/><p>This news will definitely make many fans excited.</p><br/><p>The Chinese team was star-studded. If Ling Xuefeng and Li Cangyu took full control of the command, there would be people who were dissatisfied. For example, a tactical arrangement based on assassination was something that Lou Wushuang was best at. Li Cangyu wouldn\u2019t hold exclusive power would would hand it over to the other gods when needed. This practice was very good.</p><br/><p>Zhao Yue asked the last question. \u201cCat God, recently there are many e-sports websites that use the word \u2018late\u2019 to describe you. Your success came too late and you won your first trophy at the end of your career. What do you want to say about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled and said, \u201cI might\u2019ve gotten the trophy a bit late but there is nothing to regret. These years of experience made me never afraid of losing. It was the countless failures that enriched my experience and tactics. There are disadvantages and advantages. There is no need to feel sorry for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>These words were very calm and atmospheric. This man worked hard for so many years but didn\u2019t sell his hardships to the fans to seek sympathy. It was enough to see his strength.</p><br/><p>As long as he chose a path, he would firmly walk on it, every step very practical. He didn\u2019t regret it, even if he walked seven years on the tip of sharp knife</p><br/><p>Seven years, this might be \u2018late\u2019 but Li Cangyu didn\u2019t have any complaints.</p><br/><p>Such a person was the captain of the national team. Zhao Yue suddenly had full confidence in the journey of the national team!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

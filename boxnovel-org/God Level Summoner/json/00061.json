It was big and the mattress was thick. There was no need to worry about falling down when rolling over. Li Cangyu was never still when sleeping. He woke up and saw that Ling Xuefeng\u2019s quilt and sheets were all rolled up by him.</p><br/><p>This was Ling Xuefeng\u2019s home so it wasn\u2019t very good to mess up his house. Li Cangyu self-consciously tidied up the sheets and quilt before leaving the bedroom with a yawn.</p><br/><p>To his surprise, Ling Xuefeng was cooking in the kitchen. This man usually looked very serious and was considered an abstinent male god in the eyes of many fans. It was difficult to imagine that he would cook while wearing an apron.</p><br/><p>Today, Li Cangyu had the privilege of witnessing Ling Xuefeng cooking. This man\u2019s expression was still serious but under the warm light of the kitchen, his handsome face seemed to have a touch of homely warmth.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng sensed the eyes on him and looked back to see Li Cangyu standing at the door of the kitchen, yawning. A gentleness filled his eyes as he spoke in a warm, low-pitched voice. \u201cYou woke up?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu hummed, speaking while rubbing his eyes. \u201cThe time difference is really tiring. I\u2019m still sleepy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe food will be ready soon. You can wait in the dining room first.\u201d Ling Xuefeng took off the lid and looked down at the ingredients in the pot.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu suddenly smelt a strong aroma and didn\u2019t go to the dining room. He greedily came over and glanced at the pot, finding a pot of braised pork. He drooled as he said, \u201cThe colour looks good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe taste is also delicious.\u201d Ling Xuefeng stated.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled, \u201cDon\u2019t you know how to be modest?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling the truth.\u201d Ling Xuefeng grabbed a piece of meat out of the pot with his chopsticks and placed it at Li Cangyu\u2019s lips. \u201cDo you believe me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu immediately opened his mouth and ate the meat.</p><br/><p>He was a bit hungry after sleeping. The braised pork was tender and soft, a fragrant taste filling his mouth. Li Cangyu chewed the meat with a contented face and swallowed, seemingly unaware that Ling Xuefeng had been feeding him.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng showed a faint smile. This big cat really didn\u2019t move when eating. Feeding him meat made him feel very good!</p><br/><p>Of course, Ling Xuefeng immediately retracted his gaze after feeding the piece of meat. He pretended to calmly put all the braised pork onto a plate. There were already two vegetable dishes set on the counter, the green colour increasing people\u2019s appetites.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng handed the plate to Li Cangyu and said, \u201cYou take this to the dining room first. I will prepare the soup.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Li Cangyu accept the task and brought the three dishes to the dining room. Then he went back to get the cutlery.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng soon finished the seaweed egg soup. Li Cangyu drooled at the sight of the three dishes and soup on the table.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou just ate fish at noon so I didn\u2019t make fish. I will cook it for you next time.\u201d Ling Xuefeng said as he handed over rice.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I ate too much fish at lunch. It is good to change the taste at night.\u201d Li Cangyu might love to eat fish but even he would be tired of it when eating it for two meals a day. The dishes made by Ling Xuefeng also fit his taste. Li Cangyu raised his chopsticks and immersed himself in eating. As he ate, he couldn\u2019t help praising, \u201cThe peas are delicious\u2026 the dishes are delicious\u2026 the pork is the best!\u201d</p><br/><p>In any case, it was all delicious.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng was in an excellent mood after being praised. He was particularly satisfied after seeing Li Cangyu eat vegetables.</p><br/><p>They were captains and the pressure on their shoulders was very big. There were many things to do but this time, Li Cangyu made an effort to see Ling Xuefeng. They might only be able to meet for a short time but Ling Xuefeng was very satisfied.</p><br/><p>Personally cooking a few dishes for him and eating face to face, this was the more relaxed and pleasant thing for Ling Xuefeng.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>After eating, Li Cangyu helped Ling Xuefeng clean up the table. He looked at his watch and said, \u201cThe second round of the regular season is about to start. Wind Colour must be very busy so you can return to the team first. I will take a taxi to the airport myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, I\u2019ll take you there.\u201d Ling Xuefeng stated.</p><br/><p>Vice-Captain Yan Ruiwen was very conscientious and there was no need to worry about the other old players on the team. The most troubling Qin Mo had been abused by Cat God and his mindset improved a lot. Ling Xuefeng was very confident in his team. It was rare to see a loved one and he wanted more time alone with Li Cangyu.</p><br/><p>Since the other person was determined to send him away, Li Cangyu didn\u2019t refuse. He simply said, \u201cThen I will go and pack my things. We have to leave as soon as possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, remember not to leave anything behind.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu didn\u2019t have much luggage so he quickly packed up. The two people arrived at the airport early. LIng Xuefeng sat with Li Cangyu for a while until it was 9 o\u2019clock and Li Cangyu got up to go to security.</p><br/><p>\u201cGoodbye.\u201d Li Cangyu took the initiative to reach out to Ling Xuefeng. Ling Xuefeng\u2019s heart almost stopped from excitement and he immediately hugged back.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng clung tightly to Li Cangyu for a while before letting go, whispering, \u201cSee you in New York in October.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu nodded. \u201cYes, I\u2019ll wait for you to come.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he turned and waved to Ling Xuefeng. \u201cI\u2019m going now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng smiled and waved to him. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu walked briskly away, his slender and upright back disappearing into the crowd. Then Ling Xuefeng removed his gaze and left the airport.</p><br/><p>His heart was very reluctant but Ling Xuefeng knew this was just a short parting. They would soon see each other again.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>That night, Ling Xuefeng returned to the Wind Colour team where all the members were present.</p><br/><p>In this one week holiday period, many players went home to visit their parents while others travelled abroad. Now that the holiday was over, everyone must quickly regain their mindset to deal with the second round of the regular season.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng summoned all the players to the meeting room for a routine meeting.</p><br/><p>A big projection screen occupied the middle of a wall. Ling Xuefeng calmly pointed to the big screen with a laser pointer. \u201cThis is the result of the first round of the regular season. Our team is currently first in the rankings. In the second round of the regular season, we can\u2019t relax. The gap with Flying Feathers, Time and Ghost Spirits isn\u2019t big. One mistake might reverse the situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng continued saying, \u201cI want everyone here to be as effective as possible during the second round of the regular season. I\u2019m not asking you to win every game but you should at least play in a wonderful manner.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Ling Xuefeng in the team strategy meeting and the Ling Xuefeng who smiled at the airport while watching his loved one leave seemed like two different people.</p><br/><p>Captain Ling\u2019s expression was currently very serious, the powerful aura making players unable to look directly into his eyes. His voice was very calm but each sentence contain a great weight.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe first match of the second round is against the Pure Cleansing team. The style of this team is known to everyone. It is the illusion flow route. We will continue to use the most stable lineup. Vice-Captain Yan and I will each stare at a psychic. We will solve the Zhu Qingyue and Chu Yan combination as fast as possible while the others will take care of the black magicians in the back row\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng started to arrange the tactics of the next game in an orderly way. The players listened carefully and some people took notes.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the other teams\u2019 meeting rooms were brightly lit up. The captains of the major teams were having meetings to prepare for the second round of the sixth season\u2019s regular season.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>8 a.m. on Tuesday, the Miracle Professional League\u2019s headquarters in Beijing, China.</p><br/><p>The chairman of the league, Nan Jiangang and the high-level representatives of the game developers and operators were holding an emergency meeting.</p><br/><p>Nan Jiangang sat at the head of the table and said, \u201cI believe that everyone has seen the file sent by the Miracle World League. What suggestions do you have about the changes in the competition model?\u201d</p><br/><p>The director of the Technology Research and Development department said, \u201cThis competition format is more complicated. The R&amp;D department needs one week to reconstruct the competition information. The second round of the sixth season is about to begin. Should the competition system be changed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not urgent.\u201d Nan Jiangang said, \u201cThe sixth season is already half over. We will keep it the same. We will fully replace the system starting with the second division next season. We have to take the seventh season as a new starting point, just in line with the first World Competition in December next year.\u201d</p><br/><p>It really wasn\u2019t appropriate to change the competition format in the middle of the season. The people nodded in agreement to the chairman\u2019s decision.</p><br/><p>The minister of the promotional department said, \u201cChairman, will the selection of the six players in the World Carnival based on the data of this season or the popularity of the players? We have been discussing this matter for several days and haven\u2019t come to a conclusion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nan Jiangang thought about it and said, \u201cThe World Carnival is an entertainment gathering. Star players from all countries will be invited so it is best to choose according to popularity. This afternoon, the second round of the regular season is about to begin. What do you think about opening a voting channel and selecting the six most popular players in to go New York to participate in the World Carnival?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChairman has a point.\u201d Someone nodded in agreement.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no need to play matches in the Carnival or to consider the issue of lineup configuration. It is reasonable to select the six people with the highest popularity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho do you think the six people will be?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf the voting method is followed, there is no doubt about the popularity of Ling Xuefeng, Su Guangmo and Tan Shitian. In my opinion, Captain Lou of Ghost Spirits should also be selected?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPure Cleansing\u2019s captain, Xiao Zhu is also very popular. He is the league\u2019s best auxiliary and he has quite a lot of fans.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCheng Wei\u2019s popularity also isn\u2019t low, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Pingsheng of Flying Feathers might be unsociable but he is actually quite popular\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Chairman Nan listened to the heated discussion and couldn\u2019t help sighing. \u201cThere are too many excellent players in the current Miracle League. It is a headache picking just six people for the Carnival!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a good thing!\u201d The promotional minister said with a smile, \u201cThe Miracle League in China has developed very quickly in recent years. It isn\u2019t inferior to Japan, South Korea, Europe and the United States. The players we choose to go definitely won\u2019t show a bad appearance to the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d Chairman Nan laughed. \u201cI am even more relieved that one of our talented players is coming back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTalented player?\u201d Someone asked doubtfully. \u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTan Shitian\u2019s story about a big cat and kitten, you should study it well.\u201d Chairman Nan smiled and continued, \u201cThere is also the legion defense in the new Moonlight Forest District where both the Bright Goddess and Dark Goddess were killed. You should be able to guess the commanders on both sides.\u201d</p><br/><p>Someone immediately took out their phone and opened it to Tan Shitian\u2019s Weibo. However, he found that Captain Tan had deleted the story and many people were confused.</p><br/><p>Finally, a veteran who spent six years in the Miracle League said, \u201cBig cat and a kitten? There seems to be only one player in the Miracle League who has something to do with \u2018cat\u2019. Is it\u2026 Old Cat, Li Cangyu of the first season?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nan Jiangang nodded with admiration.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs Cat God back?\u201d Someone exclaimed with surprise. \u201cAre you certain about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nan Jiangang smiled and said, \u201cOf course I am sure. Liu Chuan of the Dragon Warriors Club has contacted me. He will complete the team registration by the end of the year and Li Cangyu\u2019s personal information has been transferred to the Miracle League.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d Some people excitedly exclaimed. \u201cCat God\u2019s hand speed is a match with Ling Xuefeng\u2019s and is ranked in the forefront of the world. If he returns, our country\u2019s summoners will soar into the sky!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nan Jiangang also felt very relieved.</p><br/><p>As the chairman of the Miracle League, he had run and tried to persuade Li Cangyu not to leave, his mouth almost breaking. However, Li Cangyu\u2019s attitude was extremely firm and he was very decisive. Nan Jiangang still remembered this young man\u2019s upright back and confident appearance when leaving.</p><br/><p>Now he was returning and was bound to be criticized. Still, Nan Jiangang believed that this man wasn\u2019t a careless person. His every choice was him following his own heart and he was clear-minded.</p><br/><p>His return this time meant he was definitely coming for the championship trophy!</p><br/><p>Once Old Cat returns, the seventh season would definitely become quite lively!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

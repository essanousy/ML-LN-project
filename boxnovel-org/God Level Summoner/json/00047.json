According to the president of the Flying Feathers Guild, the elf summoner was particularly powerful and was perhaps A\u2019Shu\u2019s teammate. He wanted to see what Love to Eat Braised Fish\u2019s level was.</p><br/><p>However, the system responded with a prompt.</p><br/><p>[Love to Eat Braised Fish has refused your invitation.]</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo asked in a private chat: [Why did you refuse? Let\u2019s try it.]</p><br/><p>\u2018Try it out in order to find out who I am? It is better to keep the mystery.\u2019 Li Cangyu thought this and decisively replied: [I won\u2019t try it. I don\u2019t want to deal a blow to your confidence.]</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t afraid to flash his tongue when talking like that?</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo endured the urge to enter slaughter mode and sent an invitation to the black magician next.</p><br/><p>[Steamed Bass has refused your invitation.]</p><br/><p>The confused Su Guangmo talked to him in a private message: [Why? You don\u2019t want to learn anything from fighting me?]</p><br/><p>Steamed Bass replied: [I don\u2019t want to because I don\u2019t want to deal a blow to your confidence.]</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Were the both of them wearing the same pants? The words were the same, did they discuss this in advance?</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo was laughed at by these two people. He couldn\u2019t help looking back and saying to Yu Pingsheng, \u201cLove to Eat Braised Fish and Steamed Bass, these two people are quite interesting. They don\u2019t want to deal a blow to my confidence? It seems that A\u2019Shu\u2019s new team isn\u2019t simple!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you saying that A\u2019Shu has joined a new team?\u201d Yu Pingsheng asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Su Guangmo continued, \u201cThis kid has a good idea. I just don\u2019t know if he has found reliable teammates.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWith A\u2019Shu\u2019s eyes, they shouldn\u2019t be bad?\u201d Yu Pingsheng spoke seriously.</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo also believed that Xie Shurong wouldn\u2019t join a team that wasn\u2019t reliable when his level was in the upper ranks of any major domestic team. However, the current eight strong teams tended to have a fixed style. Xie Shurong\u2019s style was best integrated into the Flying Feathers team but he didn\u2019t return to Flying Feathers. It wasn\u2019t appropriate to enter other teams so shuffling the cards was a good choice.</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo always regarded Xie Shurong as a younger brother. They might argue every day but he appreciated Xie Shurong\u2019s novel ideas and his sharp and offensive style of play. It was because their relationship was so close that he spoke without thinking and drove the 18 year old away. This was Su Guangmo\u2019s last regret in the past few years.</p><br/><p>However, Su Guangmo didn\u2019t intend to save his younger brother. After all, Xie Shurong had now grown up and would have his own ideas. The past things would be left as memories in the heart.</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo thought this and privately chatted to Xie Shurong: [Once you return home, tell me. I will treat you to a meal.]</p><br/><p>[Well, there is a great god in my team. You should be mentally prepared and not lose your eyeballs.]</p><br/><p>[Who is this great god?] Su Guangmo asked curiously.</p><br/><p>[I won\u2019t tell you!] Xie Shurong said with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Whetting up his appetite only to not fulfill it, this guy was obviously doing it intentionally!</p><br/><p>Since he wasn\u2019t willing to say it, Su Guangmo no longer asked. Xie Shurong\u2019s team would eventually make a public appearance.</p><br/><p>As Su Guangmo and Xie Shurong were chatting, Yu Pingsheng had been quietly sitting like a ghost and staring at the computer screen. He always had no sense of existence. If other people didn\u2019t talk to him, he would sit quietly, as transparent as the air.</p><br/><p>But once he saw these messages, he suddenly suggested, \u201cIs it Li Cangyu?\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice was as clear as cold water, causing Su Guangmo to recover his spirit.</p><br/><p>Yes, Li Cangyu! Why didn\u2019t he think of this?</p><br/><p>The greatest god who was an elf summoner was Old Cat, Li Cangyu.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong said there was a great god on his team and the elf summoner by his side definitely wasn\u2019t weak. The news that the Canglan team had been disbanded not long ago had been passed onto Miracle by Cheng Wei and Old Cat\u2019s whereabouts were currently unknown\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIs Cat God coming back?\u201d Su Guangmo looked at his younger brother with surprise and saw Yu Pingsheng\u2019s bright eyes.</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng said earnestly, \u201cWhen it comes to elf summoners, Cat God is the strongest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d Su Guangmo said thoughtfully. \u201cIf this is the case, A\u2019Shu\u2019s team will be great.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng asked, \u201cDo you think Captain Ling knows about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo replied positively, \u201cIf we know then Ling Xuefeng definitely knows. He has the best relationship with Cat God.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng nodded in agreement.</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo sent a message to Love to Eat Braised Fish: [Is Cat God on the other side of the computer?]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu solemnly sent back: [Who is Cat God?]</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo laughed. [Don\u2019t pretend. The ID of Love to Eat Braised Fish has already betrayed you.]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu: [\u2026]</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Speaking of \u2018Cat God loves to eat fish\u2019, this was something that all old players knew.</p><br/><p>The first season, Li Cangyu quickly became famous due to his strong personal ability. He was ranked first among the elves. Together with demon Ling Xuefeng, terran Song Yang, angel Xu Luo and the blood kin Mo Quan, they were called the Five Gods and were the representatives of the five races.</p><br/><p>The FTD team didn\u2019t make the playoffs in the first season but Cat God\u2019s personal ability was widely recognized in the Miracle League.</p><br/><p>After the opening ceremony of the second season, the Miracle League\u2019s chairman Nan Jiangang organized a dinner in the host city of Shanghai. At that time, Song Yang was the captain of Flying Feathers and Su Guangmo and Yu Pingsheng were rookies who just debuted. They went with their master to this dinner.</p><br/><p>Chairman Nana boldly booked a hall on the third floor of the hotel, set up dozens of tables and invited all the contestants.</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo and Yu Pingsheng consciously sat at a table filled with new people. Ling Xuefeng, Li Cangyu, Song Yang and the old players who debuted in the first season sat at the table next to them.</p><br/><p>Everyone was chatting while eating and the atmosphere was enjoyable.</p><br/><p>Later, the waiter came with a plate of braised fish. Su Guangmo and most of the people at this table were full and no one liked to eat fish. They ate a bit before putting the fish aside. Then Ling Xuefeng suddenly turned to them and asked, \u201cAre you eating this fish?\u201d</p><br/><p>The new people were full of awe towards Captain Ling and quickly said, \u201cWe aren\u2019t eating it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen give it to me.\u201d Ling Xuefeng said.</p><br/><p>Then they saw Ling Xuefeng put the plate of fish in front of a person.</p><br/><p>This man was very handsome, with short hair and sparkling eyes. At this time, he was burying his head and earnestly eating fish. He completely turned a deaf ear to the conversation between Xu Luo and Song Yang, as if the fish was his whole world.</p><br/><p>His technique of eating fish was absolutely first class and the fish was eaten clean, leaving an intact fish bone.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t seem to be done after eating. He picked up a paper towel and wiped his mouth. He had just looked up when he found that Ling Xuefeng gave him a plate of fish. He smiled, patted Ling Xuefeng\u2019s shoulder in thanks and continued to eat fish.</p><br/><p>The more shocking thing was that the expressionless Ling Xuefeng smiled at the man!</p><br/><p>The smile was very small. If Su Guangmo hadn\u2019t been looking in his direction, he wouldn\u2019t have detected it.</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo hadn\u2019t expected the serious Ling Xuefeng, usually called a forbidden god by the fans, to actually show a smiling expression.</p><br/><p>The new people who had the fish taken away looked at the next table and all had an admiring expression when they saw the handsome man quickly take care of the second fish.</p><br/><p>After a while, Song Yang called the new people to his table for a toast and also introduced them. \u201cSu Guangmo, ID Pale Wolf and Yu Pingsheng, ID Misty Rain. These two people are my apprentices and I am bringing them to the field this year. Everyone should take care.\u201d</p><br/><p>The handsome man who had just eaten fish stood up with a glass of red wine. He patted Su Guangmo\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cI\u2019ll cheer you on. Follow your master and learn a lot. You future will definitely be promising.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo politely smiled, \u201cThank you Cat God.\u201d</p><br/><p>Unlike Li Cangyu\u2019s straightforwardness, Ling Xuefeng had a very serious appearance from beginning to end. He didn\u2019t say anything to the newcomers, he just stood up and touched cups with Su Guangmo and the others.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng looked at Li Cangyu pouring a glass of wine and whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t get drunk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu replied, \u201cToday I am happy and will drink a bit more. If I get drunk, you can carry me back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>The way these two were talking seemed different from others?</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo later knew that these two people knew each other in the online game. Compared to when they were opponents in the competition, Ling and Li had a pure friendship in the online game.</p><br/><p>It was also from this day that everyone in the league knew Li Cangyu loved to eat fish. After finishing the plate on his table and the fish that Ling Xuefeng gave him, he saw there was still half a plate on the next table and ate it\u2026</p><br/><p>He took fish as a staple dish and even ate three dishes, he was truly powerful!</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo had seen many videos of Cat God playing the game but this was his first close contact with Cat God. He didn\u2019t expect that the fast-moving elf summoner on the field was actually a fish foodie!</p><br/><p>Cat God\u2019s love of fish quickly spread through the league. Those who were familiar with him would often joke around.</p><br/><p>\u201cCat God, if you let me have 10% blood tomorrow then I will give you two braised fish.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCat God, I will buy you a plate of sweet and sour fish if you waste a big move!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCat God, you always kill me so happily. Should I send you a plate of West Lake vinegar fish?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo recalled these past events and couldn\u2019t help smiling.</p><br/><p>In fact, the first three seasons of the Miracle League didn\u2019t have a perfect system but the atmosphere was much better than it was now. Many players gossiped in a group chat and some opponents even became good friends in private.</p><br/><p>Unlike now, where the competition between teams was too strong. In addition, the pressure on professional players was so great that most of the time, everyone was training and researching tactics. The communication between different teams was reduced.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, the cat who loved to eat fish was returning to Miracle. The Miracle League would become completely lively!</p><br/><p>[Cat God\u2019s taste hasn\u2019t changed? You always loved to eat braised fish.] Su Guangmo said with a smile.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu saw this and had to admit it. [I also love to eat other types of fish.]</p><br/><p>[You are making a new team in Miracle? You seem full of confidence?]</p><br/><p>[It is natural.]</p><br/><p>[Have you gathered all your teammates?]</p><br/><p>[I still have a way to go.] Li Cangyu paused before asking: [By the way, where is your master Song Yang? I haven\u2019t contacted him for a long time.]</p><br/><p>[He completely left the league after the second season and is currently in the food and beverages business.]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was curious: [Dining? What type of store did he open?]</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo replied: [He opened several grilled fish chain stores.]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was immediately interested: [Grilled fish? Where is it? Can I get a discount if I go to eat?]</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Cat God, weren\u2019t we discussing your return to Miracle? How did you turn it around towards fish?</p><br/><p>A few years passed but this man still hadn\u2019t changed his nature!</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo suddenly felt that Cat God was quite fun. In the game, he aggressively abused the opponents without showing mercy. Many players were crushed to frustration when they played him. However, once the game finished, he would look everywhere for fish. A person who recommended him a good place to eat fish would be regarded as a good friend. The reason he had such a good relationship with Ling Xuefeng was definitely because Ling Xuefeng often gave him fish!</p><br/><p>He became hungry when talking about this so Su Guangmo hurriedly changed the topic. [A\u2019Shu is in your team?]</p><br/><p>[Yes, I happened to meet him in the new district.]</p><br/><p>[Since Cat God is personally leading the team, I can rest assured about A\u2019Shu following you. I will wait for both of you to come back together.] Su Guangmo added: [My master\u2019s store is in Kunming. Once we have the opportunity, I will take you to see him.]</p><br/><p>[Okay, I\u2019ll see you then!}</p><br/><p>[Yes, good luck.]</p><br/><p>The conversation ended here and Su Guangmo simply quit the game.</p><br/><p>Needless to say, even Li Cangyu\u2019s level would decline after a few years. But with his outstanding awareness, he could easily beat the new generation of players who hadn\u2019t experienced his abuse in the league. Xie Shurong was Song Yang\u2019s disciple and his talent wasn\u2019t bad. If he wasn\u2019t mistaken, the healer around Li Cangyu was probably his old partner Bai Xuan. This combination alone would make them unable to be underestimated. Not to mention there might be other strong teammates.</p><br/><p>The return of such a team to the Miracle League would definitely have a strong impact on the current eight giants.</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo wasn\u2019t worried about it.</p><br/><p>He looked back and saw that Yu Pingsheng\u2019s expression was very calm. His mood didn\u2019t fluctuate, the black and clear eyes staying as calm as ever even if he knew the other person was Cat God.</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng was such a person. He was introverted, not good at words and his surface seemed as quiet as stagnant water. However, once on the field, he would erupt fiercely enough to burn all fire!</p><br/><p>Berserker, this was the most violent melee class and used a heavy axe as a weapon.</p><br/><p>The little swordsman who once hid behind his brothers had now grown to be the first berserker in the Miracle League. He was a strong front row who defended his teammates. The young captain who was once impulsive had now become one of the most admired people in the Miracle League.</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo and Yu Pingsheng, the two of them joined hands to bring up a new generation of Flying Feathers. The current strength of Flying Feathers was first-class. Su Guangmo had confidence in himself, Yu Pingsheng and the entire team.</p><br/><p>A real strong player wouldn\u2019t be afraid of strong opponents but would look forward to confronting them.</p><br/><p>Thus, he was looking forward to the team up of Old Cat and his younger brother!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He also appreciated Li Cangyu\u2019s straightforward words at the end.</p><br/><p>His favourite thing was Li Cangyu\u2019s confident and calm expression.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu\u2019s remark definitely wasn\u2019t boastful because in the current Miracle League\u2026 there was only one elf summoner.</p><br/><p>However, many spectators were fooled by him and couldn\u2019t notice this point. Only the female reporter at the scene recovered quickly and threw a sharp question at Li Cangyu. \u201cCat God, you said that you are the most powerful elf summoner. Is this domestically or globally? If it is domestic, there is only one elf summoner among the eight teams in the first division.\u201d</p><br/><p>The audience, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s spirits returned. This reporter was right. There was only one elf summoner domestically so he was naturally the strongest. No one could compare to him!</p><br/><p>If it was globally then it wouldn\u2019t be the same\u2026</p><br/><p>Everyone was looking forward to Li Cangyu\u2019s answer and he didn\u2019t hesitate to give it to them. \u201cOf course, it is the world. What is the point domestically when no one else in the country plays an elf summoner?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was shocked. The Canglan team often boasted that they were handsome or played well but Li Cangyu was on a different level. He directly boasted that he was the best elf summoner in the world!</p><br/><p>His boasting was so big that wasn\u2019t he afraid of it ending in failure?</p><br/><p>Many Li Cangyu fans wrote on his Weibo: [Cat God, act more leisurely and don\u2019t boast so big!] [I didn\u2019t expect you to be such a Cat God!] [Ah Shu, Xiao Zhuo and Old Zhang\u2019s casual boasts can\u2019t compare to you!] [Cat God, you have completed the upgrade of your boasting skill This boast, I give it full marks!]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was sitting at the venue and naturally didn\u2019t know what Weibo was going crazy. His expression was very calm, as if he was saying what he had to eat today.</p><br/><p>The female reporter was silent for a moment before asking politely, \u201cCat God, do you really feel that you are the world\u2019s strongest elf summoner? The United States, Japan, Korean, Germany\u2026 many countries have very strong elf summoners. In addition, in the current world summoner rankings, the top four are the blood kin summoner Jack Josh, the demon summoner Ling Xuefeng, the angel summoner Kim Jongho and the elf summoner Mitchell. Your name can\u2019t be seen at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled and declared with confidence, \u201cThat\u2019s because it has been three years since I\u2019ve left Miracle, the people in charge of the statistics have long forgotten me. I\u2019m sure that by the end of this year\u2019s season, everyone will see my name on the rankings.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The female reporter, who was always known for her sharp questions, was dumbfounded and could only sit down helplessly.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng really admired the bold Li Cangyu. He could be so calm in the face of the reporter\u2019s sharp questions. Not only did he answer confidently, he boasted that he would enter the world rankings.</p><br/><p>What if it didn\u2019t happen?</p><br/><p>However, Li Cangyu\u2019s personality was always straightforward. The fact that he dared to say this today showed his goal\u2014the peak of the world\u2019s summoners.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The video of the post-match interview was released and Weibo instantly split into two sides. One side supported Li Cangyu and felt that this confident player was really manly and attractive. The other side thought unfavorably and felt that Li Cangyu shouldn\u2019t be arrogant. He should be humble since modesty was a virtue.</p><br/><p>The netizens were arguing but Li Cangyu\u2019s number of Weibo fans rose significantly. In just a few days, he caught up with the great gods of the Miracle League. He had left Miracle for three years and his popularity after coming back was inferior to rising stars like Tan Shitian and Liu Xiang. Now the number of people who liked him rose greatly.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu also received extensive attention from netizens in the Miracle League. Many people ridiculed him saying: [Daring to call himself the world\u2019s best elf summoner but he can\u2019t even leave the country!] [Maybe he can\u2019t even get into the national team yet he is bragging here\u2026]</p><br/><p>[The Canglan team\u2019s boasting is really bad. It turns out to be due to the captain!]</p><br/><p>The Canglan team looked at these comments and felt helpless.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan had been with Li Cangyu for many years and his mood was particularly complicated. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you be a bit more humble? Why do you have to say this and be miserably scolded?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was calm. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I will prove with my strength that what I said is true.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong patted him on the shoulder. \u201cCaptain, I am sure that you will definitely become the world\u2019s strongest elf summoner but now the demon summoner called Ling Xuefeng is in front of you. This is the key point.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan nodded in agreement. \u201cYes, do you have any idea about how to play the next match?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled. \u201cLet me think about it again.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>That night, Li Cangyu held his phone and lay in bed. He was just about to send a message to Ling Xuefeng but their hearts must be connected. A message from Ling Xuefeng popped up on the screen. [Has the world\u2019s strongest elf summoner gone back to his dormitory?]</p><br/><p>The abstinent male god actually made such a cold joke. Li Cangyu was amused and immediately replied: [I\u2019m back, what are you doing?]</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng: [I just finished my shower.]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu: [The next match against Canglan, is the tactical layout ready?]</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng: [No.]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu: [What modes are you going to choose?]</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng asked: [What do you think?]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu typed: [I think you will choose arena, team battle and arena.]</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng: [Why?]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu bluntly said: [This way I am more likely to win!]</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng laughed. [You are asking me about tactics. Aren\u2019t you afraid I will lie to you?]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu: [No, you will never lie. If you can\u2019t tell me then you won\u2019t speak. If you tell me then it must be true.]</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng\u2019s heart was warm. He didn\u2019t expect Li Cangyu to know him so well and to trust him, Indeed, he couldn\u2019t lie to Li Cangyu. When it came to the tactical secrets, the best way was to not tell each other.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu definitely knew this and was just asking as a joke.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng thought this and changed the topic: [The first round of the regular season is coming to an end. Now the Canglan team\u2019s ranking is in danger. In the second round, you can\u2019t be too willful and must act carefully.]</p><br/><p>Li Canglan seriously replied: [I know. The training of the newcomers is almost complete. Canglan must take more points in the second round or it will be troublesome if we can\u2019t get into the playoffs.]</p><br/><p>[Yes, maintain this good mindset.]</p><br/><p>[Wind Colour doesn\u2019t need to be afraid. Based on the current rankings, you should steadily make it into the playoffs?]</p><br/><p>[Not necessarily. The teams are more stabilized in the second round. It isn\u2019t impossible for a team ranked first to fall down.]</p><br/><p>The two people chatted for a bit. Once Li Cangyu became sleepy, he said goodbye to Ling Xuefeng and fell asleep.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The next morning, Li Cangyu called the members of the Canglan team to the training room for a meeting. This meeting was naturally to discuss the next tactical arrangements against the Wind Colour team. Everyone listened carefully.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu once again used a PPT to introduce the Wind Colour team. This time, the PPT obviously wasn\u2019t made by Ling Xuefeng. It was a simple white background with black words. There were no effect at all. Still, the contents were concise and basically spelled out the current situation of the Wind Colour team.</p><br/><p>\u201cWind Colour\u2019s captain, Ling Xuefeng. I don\u2019t need to talk much about him. He is currently the strongest demon player in the Miracle League. Everyone should\u2019ve seen the previous matches and realize how strong he is. Today I will give you a detailed introduction of the Wind Colour lineup.\u201d Li Cangyu\u2019s laser pointer stopped on a black magician with the ID of Ingrained.</p><br/><p>\u201cYan Ruiwen, the vice-captain of the Wind Colour team. He is the strongest black magician in the league and his style of play is very calm. He relies heavily on using a large number of negative states to decrease his opponent\u2019s blood and create opportunities for his teammates to grab a head\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGuo Xuan (ID: Blade Dancer) is partnered with Vice-Captain Yan and is also a very good black magician. The combination is the most classic black magic overlap style that netizens imitate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe blood kin summoners Xu Feifan and Qin Mo. One of these two players usually partner up with Ling Xuefeng to form the strong field control combination of double summoners. A summoner has many pets and the control skills can work together to achieve a seamless connection. This is the basis of Wind Colour\u2019s strong field control.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe other players aren\u2019t so famous but they are all old players who have followed Ling Xuefeng for many years. Their form is very stable. Among them, the front row beast berserker, Liao Zhenyu has a very strong attack. He is a typical offensive defender. The healer is He Qun and he is a rare demon sacrifice. A sacrifice has less skills to add blood but there are more status skills. He can often create protective shields for his teammates.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe last one is called Lin Ke. He just debuted this season. Ling Xuefeng should be preparing him as a transition after Guo Xuan retires. He is a black magician reserve and hasn\u2019t appeared many times in recent matches.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu introduced all the players and turned a page on the PPT. He said, \u201cWind Colour is a typical magic based time. The team battle lineup is generally two black magicians, two summoners, a front row protector and a healer. Ling Xuefeng is the core of the team. As long as he controls a person, his teammates will set fire to kill that person. This is the most terrifying thing about the Wind Colour team. The output of all four attackers is the fiercest among all teams in the league.\u201d</p><br/><p>Next, he played a few featured clips from games, most of whom included people like Tan Shitian, Su Guangmo and other great gods. The more they looked, the more surprised they became. Wind Colour sometimes crushed the other team and their method of breaking the rhythm was terrible.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu saw that everyone was solemn and smiled slightly. \u201cThe truth is that it is basically impossible to gain an early advantage against Wind Colour. We have to play for the worst and then prepare to overturn the table.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu gave everyone a preventive shot. The opponents were the champions of the sixth season and they couldn\u2019t be careless.</p><br/><p>It was only be preparing for the worst that they would be able to burn the boats and win the game.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu couldn\u2019t help becoming excited at the thought of meeting Ling Xuefeng on the field after several years.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

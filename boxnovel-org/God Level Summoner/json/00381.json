These words burst in his ears like thunder. Yu Pingsheng stared at Su Guangmo with surprise, not believing this person could actually say such words.</p><br/><p>The man in front of him was no longer a teenager. After several years of experience, Su Guangmo was now the second-generation captain of Flying Feathers. He was a sword god respected and worshipped by fans.</p><br/><p>His five senses faded away from the youthful appearance and became more handsome and three-dimensional. At this time, Su Guangmo was looking at Yu Pingsheng tenderly and his words didn\u2019t seem like a joke at all.</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng was silent for a long time before managing to say, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo was amused by the difficult word he managed to say and smiled. He reached out and touched Yu Pingsheng\u2019s nose. \u201cIt is because you look too good and your personality is special. I can\u2019t move my eyes away from you. I like you and can\u2019t control it at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>His words were very straightforward. Yu Pingsheng\u2019s ears slightly reddened and he thought for a while before managing to say, \u201cI am your younger apprentice brother and a man\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo was decisive. \u201cI like you as a person. It has nothing to do with your identity and gender.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng looked at his brother with distress. The words were too good but he couldn\u2019t say yes to the other person. After all, he always regarded Su Guangmo as his brother. He never thought their relationship would develop into lovers.</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo saw Yu Pingsheng\u2019s hesitant eyes and sighed. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. I won\u2019t force you to make a decision. We will go back first and you can slowly think about it. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng was silent for a moment before nodding and going back to the hotel with Su Guangmo.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>This confession was particularly calm. Yu Pingsheng didn\u2019t react to calmly and lay in bed, thinking silently. Su Guangmo didn\u2019t interrupt him. He just smiled and watched the person sitting in front of him.</p><br/><p>When Su Guangmo was young, he liked this because Yu Pingsheng was special and could get along with him. Then Su Guangmo found that Yu Pingsheng was the most suitable person for him. Sometimes he would be sulky but once he returned to his dormitory and saw Yu Pingsheng, his anger would disappear completely. No matter the difficulties he faced, he would feel extremely stable if Yu Pingsheng was around.</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng\u2019s indifferent and peaceful temperament made Su Guangmo feel particularly comfortable. Whenever he held this person in his arms, his heart would be filled with a type of tranquil warmth.</p><br/><p>This was the life that Su Guangmo wanted.</p><br/><p>Maybe one day, he would retire like his master and stop playing Miracle. His life would lack the excitement and emotions of the competition but as long as Yu Pingsheng could follow him quietly, his heart would be full of warmth.</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo would never let go of this man, the love he had identified since his youth. He wanted to take care of this person for the rest of his life, spending time with him.</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng hadn\u2019t turned the corner yet and Su Guangmo wasn\u2019t in a hurry to force him. In any case, there was a long time and he could think slowly.</p><br/><p>After discovering that this brother had fallen asleep while thinking, Su Guangmo smiled slightly and gently covered him with the quilt.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng dreamt of Su Guangmo.</p><br/><p>Over the years, Su Guangmo had been protecting him and infinitely tolerated him. If there wasn\u2019t his brother, he couldn\u2019t be an e-sports player. It was even more impossible to walk on the big stage, facing the glaring lights and the applause of the audience.</p><br/><p>His parents nurtured him but Su Guangmo reinvented him.</p><br/><p>From a boy who feared being close to and communicating with others to the vice-captain of Flying Feathers who could calmly face reporters and fans. It was a makeover.</p><br/><p>In the dream, there were images of training with his brother and scenes where his brother took him out to play. They drove through mountains and past rivers, tasting the food outside. It was a life he couldn\u2019t think of when he was a child. The vast world outside unfolded in front of him like a scroll and he slowly discovered how small he was.</p><br/><p>The world was wide and life was wonderful. He shouldn\u2019t close himself into a narrow corner. He liked his present life and this was attributed to Su Guangmo\u2019s patience and companionship.</p><br/><p>Upon waking up in the morning, Yu Pingsheng recalled his dream. The dream was full of Su Guangmo\u2019s shadow. He was surprised to find that unconsciously, his brother had already entered the depths of his heart.</p><br/><p>Could this type of unrequited feeling become love? Yu Pingsheng wasn\u2019t sure.</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo woke up earlier than Yu Pingsheng and found that his brother had woken up and was sitting on the bed while thinking. Su Guangmo couldn\u2019t help going to him and whispering, \u201cWhat are you thinking about? Is it me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng had the middle of the matter poked and nodded with red cheeks. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo was in a great mood and smiled as he hugged this person. \u201cYou really never lie. I like this honesty. Tell me, what are you thinking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng hesitated for a moment before seriously replying, \u201dI was thinking that if we become lovers, how will we get along?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was rare for him to say such a long sentence and Su Guangmo\u2019s heart beat wildly. Since Yu Pingsheng was thinking about it, this showed he had Su Guangmo in his heart. Yu Pingsheng wasn\u2019t thinking about refusing but was thinking about how to accept! Sure enough, the companionship of many years had played a role.</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo resisted the urge to hold this person down and patiently replied, \u201cIn fact, I will still take care of you as I used to. If we aren\u2019t lovers and are just brothers, my parents will definitely wait for me to retire before forcing me to find a girlfriend. Then I will have no time to accompany you. However, if you are my lover then I will spend the rest of my life with you. After a few years, we will both retire and I will drive you everywhere to play.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo paused and carefully observed his younger brother\u2019s expression. \u201cDo you want me to find a girlfriend to accompany her, regardless of you? Or do you hope that I will always be with you and accompany you in the future?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng thought for a moment before looking up at Su Guangmo and replying quietly, \u201cOnly accompany me.\u201d</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t lying.</p><br/><p>\u2018Only accompany me.\u2019 These words directly poked the softest part of Su Guangmo\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo was very excited and tightened his grip on the person in his arms. He whispered, \u201cYes, then I will only accompany you. You will be the only one in my life.\u201d</p><br/><p>This promise made Yu Pingsheng feel extra peace of mind and he couldn\u2019t help returning the other person\u2019s embrace, nestling his head on Su Guangmo\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng didn\u2019t respond directly but his performance showed he acquiesced to be with Su Guangmo as \u2018lovers\u2019. However, he didn\u2019t know the essential difference between \u2018lover\u2019 and \u2018brother\u2019. He simply thought that it was as Su Guangmo said. Lovers would always accompany each other while brothers would be separated.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t want to be separated from his brother so he promised to be lovers.</p><br/><p>It turned out that being a lover wasn\u2019t as simple as he thought.</p><br/><p>For example, after watching the snow scene in Harbin for a few days, they returned to the hotel one night. As Yu Pingsheng took a shower and sat on the bed to sort out the photos taken, Su Guangmo suddenly leaned over and kissed him.</p><br/><p>The kiss caught Yu Pingsheng off guard and he forgot to resist.</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo\u2019s tongue took the opportunity to dive straight in and overbearingly swept through the other person\u2019s mouth, leaving his breath everywhere. Yu Pingsheng was kissed and his mind was blank. Once he recovered, he gasped out, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo smiled and replied bluntly, \u201cKissing you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng\u2019s face showed a hint of red and he didn\u2019t know what to say. Su Guangmo added, \u201cWe are already lovers and it is natural to kiss you. Other lovers did the same thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng had no experience and since his brother said this, it should be right?</p><br/><p>Thus, he nodded seriously. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo found that this person quietly didn\u2019t resit and his heart was moved. He leaned over and kissed Yu Pingsheng\u2019s forehead. \u201cLovers will do other things. Are you willing to try it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng had some doubts. \u201cWhat else do you want to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t like communicating with people since he was a child. After coming to the Flying Feathers team, he only knew training every day. The players watched those movies but he never looked at them. His physiological needs were less than the average man and he was as simple as a blank piece of paper.</p><br/><p>The thought of bringing this simply younger brother to the abyss, invading his body and letting him taste the most primitive joy made Su Guangmo excited.</p><br/><p>He gently pressed Yu Pingsheng to the bed, his voice low and gentle. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid and hand everything over to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng always trusted his brother. He listened to his brother\u2019s words and lay quietly on the bed, his eyes seriously watching Su Guangmo.</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo instantly hardened. The clear and bright eyes full of trust and the unprepared gestures was tempting enough to commit crimes.</p><br/><p>He took a deep breath and forcibly restrained his desires. Then he smiled and gave Yu Pingsheng a gentle, sweet kiss.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026hmm\u2026um\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng was in a daze from the kiss and his body gradually became feverish. Meanwhile, Su Guangmo\u2019s kiss became more enthusiastic as it moved from gentle to fierce. The flexible tongue moved in and entangled with Yu Pingsheng\u2019s tongue. Yu Pingsheng was almost breathless and his cheeks were red.</p><br/><p>After the deep kiss, Su Guangmo retreated and asked softly, \u201cIs it annoying?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng was silent a moment before shaking his head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the past, he hated being close to people. Whenever someone approached, he instinctively rejected them like a hedgehog. However, Su Guangmo wasn\u2019t the same. In the past few years, the two people had lived together and was inseparable. The breath of his brother made him feel familiar and safe. He physically and psychologically didn\u2019t reject Su Guangmo\u2019s closeness.</p><br/><p>Such a deep kiss didn\u2019t make him feel sick. Instead, it made his heart beat faster.</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo heard his brother\u2019s answer and couldn\u2019t help smiling. He leaned over and kissed Yu Pingsheng again.</p><br/><p>Next part has been censored. Read the uncensored link below.</p><br/><p>Uncensored Part</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng\u2019s body ached when he woke up the next morning, especially his waist which felt like it was going to break. Su Guangmo stared at him intently and leaned over to kiss his forehead. \u201cHave you woken up?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo asked, \u201cWere you comfortable last night?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng hesitated a moment before nodding honestly. \u2018Yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo smiled and hugged the living treasure in his arms. He placed his chin on top of Yu Pingsheng\u2019s head and whispered, \u201cOnce the time is right, I will visit your parents and tell them that I will treat you as the most precious lover, accompanying you for a lifetime.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng nodded gently. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>He woke up early in the morning and only said three \u2018yes.\u2019 He was the same as before and still wasn\u2019t good at expressing himself. Su Guangmo smiled and teased him. \u201cDo you like your brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng hesitating before replying sincerely, \u201cI like.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo held his brother in a contented manner.</p><br/><p>He had taken care of Yu Pingsheng for many years and gradually pulled Yu Pingsheng out of his closed inner world. Now he finally turned Yu Pingsheng into his lover and Yu Pingsheng only belonged to him.</p><br/><p>He watched his brother\u2019s fair body covered in the marks he made and smiled happily as he heard Yu Pingsheng seriously say, \u201cI like.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

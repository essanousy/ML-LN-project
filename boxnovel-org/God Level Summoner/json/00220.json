At first, everyone thought that Canglan would lost this round. After all, He Qun was an experienced veteran player and Qin Mo wasn\u2019t weak. This game was also the Space-Time Tunnel map that was Wind Colour\u2019s ace\u2026</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, Zhuo Hang and Xiao Han were so strong, using traps and guerilla attacks to send away the two people of Wind Colour.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was actually quite surprised. He thought that this round would be a tie or one of Zhuo Hang and Xiao Han would die. As a result, both of them survived. They might be residual blood but at least they were alive. The meaning of sending away the opponent was different.</p><br/><p>In Wind Colour\u2019s soundproof room, Vice-Captain Yan Ruiwen frowned with some worry. He had a type of unpredictable foreboding feeling. Wind Colour played the first game smoothly only to robbed of the fire dragon. This was Wind Colour\u2019s home and the Space-Time Tunnel where Wind Colour had the unbeaten myth, yet the start was like this\u2026</p><br/><p>Was Li Cangyu really Captain Ling\u2019s nemesis?</p><br/><p>His partner Guo Xuan couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cThey must\u2019ve trained specifically in this map.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Ruiwen continued, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect the cooperation between Zhuo Hang and Xiao Han to be so good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Captain Ling Xuefeng\u2019s expression was very calm. He heard this and finally opened his mouth, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. The two of you are next and you are both black magicians, which is superior to the Shu Bai combination.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Ruiwen smiled confidently. \u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan\u2019s healing level couldn\u2019t be doubted. Bai Xuan had the title of \u2018undying cockroach\u2019 and was the person with the highest survival ability in the Miracle League. However, the combination of two black magicians was bad for him because the two black magicians could complete the \u2018black magic overlapping\u2019 style. In other words, Yan Ruiwen and Guo Xuan could alternate stacking negative states. As long as the spells stacked, they could cause great damage using the least amount of blue consumption.</p><br/><p>In order to maintain blood volume, Bai Xuan must continue to fill up his teammate\u2019s blood. In the long run, he would face the situation of running out of blue.</p><br/><p>There must be a stable conversion ration between the amount of blue, the amount of damage and the amount of blood. Once this stability was broken, the players would become weaker in the later stages. The combination of two black magicians meant that one could act as the output and the other as the control. It was also handy in a consumption battle. The strength of the Yan Guo combination was a match for the Tan Cheng and Su Yu combinations.</p><br/><p>It was normal for Yan Ruiwen to feel confident for the second stage.</p><br/><p>After a short rest, Ling Xuefeng submitted the second pair for Wind Colour\u2014Undying Gratitude and Blade Dancer!</p><br/><p>Vice-Captain Yan and Guo Xuan\u2019s presence won enthusiastic applause from fans.</p><br/><p>At this time, Zhuo Hang only had 15%. Xiao Han had the characteristic of the blood kin race and his blood volume was slightly higher at 20%. This amount of blood wasn\u2019t enough to have an effect on the Yan Ruiwen and Guo Xuan combination.</p><br/><p>Moreover, Xiao Han\u2019s stealth skill was on cooldown and Zhuo Hang\u2019s big moves were also used. They didn\u2019t have many skills available.</p><br/><p>Yan Ruiwen didn\u2019t want to talk to the opponents. He simply took Guo Xuan to a fork. They didn\u2019t waste control skills but quickly put Death Mantra on Zhuo Hang\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Death Mantra was a basic black magic skill. It allowed the opponent to continue to lose blood for a certain period of time. The blue amount of this skill was relatively low but five layers must be stacked to achieve maximum effect. It was much easier to stack when two teammates were working together.</p><br/><p>The Yan Guo combination had been old partners for many years. They released the skills with perfect timing and Zhuo Hang had five layers of Death Mantra stacked on him.</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang was in a residual blood state but he didn\u2019t feel fear. Instead, he bravely rushed forward and placed two Stop Traps at Yan Ruiwen\u2019s foot.</p><br/><p>The damage from the traps weren\u2019t high. It was like a tickle to Yan Ruiwen\u2026</p><br/><p>Vice-Captain Yan killed Zhuo Hang with a small black magic skill.</p><br/><p>The audience gave a thumbs up to Zhuo Hang\u2019s last minute dedication. The thing that surprised everyone was that after Zhuo Hang died, Xiao Han bravely rushed forward, the dagger in his hand shining coldly. He wasn\u2019t polite to Yan Ruiwen and used a series of moves.</p><br/><p>Yan Ruiwen was trapped in place and hit by the assassin. Fortunately, Guo Xuan quickly took Xiao Han\u2019s head and there wasn\u2019t too big a loss. Otherwise, the vice-captain of Wind Colour had no face!</p><br/><p>Xiao Han was sent off and Yan Ruiwen sighed slightly with relief.</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang and Xiao Han knocked out almost 20% of his blood but his blue was still more than 90%. Guo Xuan\u2019s state was better, he had 100% blood and 95% blue. The two black magicians could join hands to slowly consume the Shu Bai combination. Their chances of winning were still big.</p><br/><p>The game was suspended again and it was Canglan\u2019s turn to pick.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu went to the command post and submitted the players. The big screen soon showed their information\u2014Old Cat, Juemingzi.</p><br/><p>Yan Ruiwen almost coughed up blood!</p><br/><p>Your sister! What about the Shu Bai combination? Cat God, you have always been the guard. Why are you suddenly appearing in advance?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

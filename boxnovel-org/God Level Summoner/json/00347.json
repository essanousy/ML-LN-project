Tan Shitian spoke seriously, \u201cSorry Captain, I failed to win this game. Now all the pressure is transferred to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled and patted his shoulder. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. You tried your best. Take a break first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian took his teammates to the side to rest and Li Cangyu turned back to Ling Xuefeng. \u201cIt seems we can only win the third game. We can\u2019t lose.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng nodded. \u201cIt is the American team\u2019s match point and we can\u2019t let them do as they wish.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, media reporters from all over the world were madly reporting on the finals.</p><br/><p>[The US team took the home game and defeated the Chinese team in the away game. They are the first to get the match point!]</p><br/><p>[The US team might beat China by 3:0 to become world champions?]</p><br/><p>[The Chinese team\u2019s always strong home game was actually countered by the US team!]</p><br/><p>[The Chinese team that had a smooth journey in the World Competition finally tasted bitterness from the host country!]</p><br/><p>The reports from various countries obviously had some elements of \u2018gloating\u2019. After all, teams like Australia, Spain and Italy were crushed 3:0 by the Chinese team while the South Korean team was eliminated 3:1. The Chinese team\u2019s performance was too dazzling and long attracted the attention of everyone.</p><br/><p>In particular, Li Cangyu, Bai Xuan and Tan Shitian had no fame in the world rankings and suddenly made a splash in the World Competition. Many people were convinced about them.</p><br/><p>The strong team finally collapsed and the reporters\u2019 gloating reports naturally attracted the attention of the audience.</p><br/><p>In the domestic live broadcast room, many sunspots took the chance to splash dirty water. [They crushed all the way through the group stage only to become paralyzed in the finals!] [Li Cangyu played against weak trash in the group stage only to be completely abused by a strong team!]</p><br/><p>Of course, these negative comments were quickly countered by the loyal Cat God fans. [It is only the second game. Why so anxious? Don\u2019t you understand the concept of lose two, chase back three?] [The score is 0:2. Cat God, wake up. Are you still not going?] [Captain Ling hasn\u2019t played yet!] [Captain Lou hasn\u2019t played yet!] [There is still hope!]</p><br/><p>The first two games were lost but fortunately, it wasn\u2019t an ugly loss.</p><br/><p>In the first game, Su Guangmo\u2019s commanding didn\u2019t have any problems and he played an excellent wave of combat between both sides. He finally lost because of the zombies on the Doomsday map.</p><br/><p>In the second game, Tan Shitian\u2019s play was also very stable. They defeated the US in the initial group combat and even had the deceleration weapon. However, Benjamin\u2019s stealing of the fire dragon at a crucial moment caught the Chinese team off guard.</p><br/><p>Even if the team lost, it wasn\u2019t a dejected loss but a justified one.</p><br/><p>Everyone on the national team played very well. The audience saw the first Miracle Chinese team as a vigorous, positive and cohesive team.</p><br/><p>Therefore, some sensible audience members still had strong confidence in the national team. The first two games might\u2019ve been lost but they were looking forward to pulling things back in the next three games.</p><br/><p>In the international arena, the classic sight of losing two and chasing back three hadn\u2019t appeared. At this time, the mentality of the players was crucial. They must be steady and absolutely couldn\u2019t be sloppy!</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>In the commentators\u2019 room, Kou Hongyi was anxious as he stared at the soundproof room. \u201cCat God should go on, he can no longer sit still! Nevertheless, we can\u2019t guess what type of lineup he will send in the third game!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Cat God is the commander, there is still a lot of room for choice. For example, there is Shu Bai and his familiar partner Xiao Han, etc.\u201d Yu Bing suddenly thought of something. \u201cOf course, there is a possibility\u2026 he will go on with Captain Ling!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kou Hongyi made a surprised expression. \u201cIs that possible? I\u2019m guessing that Cat God will appear in the third game and Captain Ling will appear in the fourth game.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Bing didn\u2019t explain it. She just had a strong hunch.</p><br/><p>The third game had to be foolproof!</p><br/><p>If the third game was lost, the US team will win directly with 3:0 and the Chinese team would completely miss the championship.</p><br/><p>Kou Hongyi\u2019s mention of Cat God in the third game and Captain Ling in the fourth game was a double insurance arrangement. However, Li Cangyu alone was less insurance than Ling Cat together.</p><br/><p>The third game was the home game of the US team. It could be seen from the Doomsday Crisis map that the maps the US team left for the finals were very difficult.</p><br/><p>Yu Bing knew Li Cangyu and Ling Xuefeng for many years and understood the extent of their connection. At this moment, she hoped the two of them could join forces in the World Competition!</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The five minutes of intermission ended and the captains sat at the command post again. This was the US team\u2019s home game and the mode submitted by Noah was still death racing. He didn\u2019t hesitate when submitting the maps because he clearly had a plan.</p><br/><p>Hollywood Universal Studios, New York Time Square, Frost Temple.</p><br/><p>The three maps appeared on the big screen at the same time.</p><br/><p>Times Square had appeared in the previous group stage. Li Cangyu had repeatedly practiced it during the last few days and it wasn\u2019t difficult to fight. The problem was that when the Hollywood Universal Studios map appeared in the first game, LI Cangyu banned it and it could no longer be banned a second time.</p><br/><p>Noah might\u2019ve submitted three maps but according to the competition rules of \u2018two country submitted maps can\u2019t be banned at the same time\u2019 and \u2018the same map can\u2019t be banned twice\u2019, Li Cangyu was forced to choose Universal Studios.</p><br/><p>In other words, Noah was forcing Li Cangyu to choose the map he wanted the Chinese team to choose.</p><br/><p>This meant the difficulty of Universal Studios didn\u2019t lose to Doomsday Crisis!</p><br/><p>It could be seen from this that the US team were well prepared for the finals. The pit left by the maps was much better than the previous Korean team.</p><br/><p>In any case, he could only choose this. Li Cangyu didn\u2019t hesitate and banned the other two.</p><br/><p>Noah then submitted the lineup\u2014 Noah (black magician), Alyssa (white magician), Thomas (archer), Jack Josh (blood kin summoner), Edmund (blood kin assassin).</p><br/><p>Among them, Edmund and Jack had played in the first game but could plan in this game due to the interval of one game.</p><br/><p>Noah\u2019s lineup could be called the American team\u2019s all-star lineup. Every player had a high popularity and him sending them showed he obviously wanted to win match point without giving the Chinese team a chance for a comeback.</p><br/><p>How would Li Cangyu respond?</p><br/><p>The domestic audience was going crazy and many people were cheering for the national team.</p><br/><p>[This match pint must be endured!] [Cat God, have strength!] [The lineup of the US team seems very complicated. In fact, it is comprehensive and every player is a world-class master!] [This map definitely isn\u2019t simple. Cat God, endure it!]</p><br/><p>Everyone was anxious commenting while Li Cangyu finally submitted the Chinese team\u2019s lineup.</p><br/><p>\u2014LI Cangyu, Ling Xuefeng, Qin Mo, Xiao Han and Bai Xuan.</p><br/><p>Kou Hongyi was so excited he almost ate his microphone. \u201cMy god! Cat God and Captain Ling actually went out together!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Bing smiled. As she expected, the Ling Cat combination showed up in the key game!</p><br/><p>There was an uproar in the domestic live broadcast room. [Ling Cat 6666!] [It is the combination of Wind Colour and Canglan!] [This is a biological weapon!] [Ling Cat is too handsome!] The video couldn\u2019t be seen clearly due to the barrage of comments.</p><br/><p>Canglan\u2019s master and apprentice and Wind Colour\u2019s master and apprentice. The three summoners were combined with a mobile assassin for a violent output. Then their survival ability was enhanced by the cockroach God Milk Bai Xuan. LI Cangyu\u2019s confident eyes seemed to be telling the US team, \u2018Don\u2019t be happy too soon!\u2019</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Park Joonseo has always been a good person and was polite when answering the reporters\u2019 questions. However, there was a clear look of regret on his face after the South Korean team failed to reach the finals. \u201cThe result of this match was beyond my expectations. I can only say that our preparations before the match wasn\u2019t enough. After returning home, we will carefully summarize the lessons learnt. The players of our country will strive to win the World Competition next year!\u201d</p><br/><p>A reporter asked, \u201cCaptain Park, what do you think about the strength of the Chinese team\u2019s captain, LI Cangyu?\u201d</p><br/><p>Park Joonseo thought about it before replying, \u201cLi Cangyu is a very admirable player. I\u2019ve heard his story and it isn\u2019t easy to persist for so many years. His personal level and commanding ability are first-class.\u201d</p><br/><p>Backstage, the brainless fan Cheng Wei watched the interview and immediately nodded in agreement. \u201cPark Joonseo has a bit of vision. He knows how amazing our Cat God is?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng gently wrapped an arm around Li Cangyu\u2019s shoulder. \u201cIt is difficult to gain the recognition of an opponent.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled at him. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact, he didn\u2019t care about other people\u2019s evaluations. He had received all types of criticisms when he first left Miracle and then when he returned. He wouldn\u2019t be able to persist if he cared too much about other people\u2019s opinions.</p><br/><p>However, Park Joonseo was one of the world\u2019s top three summoners. Li Cangyu\u2019s mood was clear after being acknowledged by such a strong opponent. It was as clear as the sun being revealed after a storm.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Park Joonseo could barely maintain the smile on his face.</p><br/><p>Many reporters from South Korea asked sharp questions in a rude and harsh tone.</p><br/><p>After all, South Korean often won against China in other e-sports competitions. They couldn\u2019t accept that in the first Miracle World Competition, South Korea actually lost to China.</p><br/><p>The reporters\u2019 questions smashed the captain and vice-captain one after another. Vice-Captain Kim Yoonhee was a female player but her character was very straightforward. She was impatient with the reporters and her expression quickly sank. Park Joonseo still maintained his smile. He was obviously used to putting on a disguise in front of the reporters.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu suddenly felt sympathy for the two people.</p><br/><p>If the Chinese team had lost, perhaps he and Ling Xuefeng would be the ones facing the reporters\u2019 bombardment?</p><br/><p>He looked over at Ling Xuefeng and met his eyes. Ling Xuefeng seemed to have guessed Li Cangyu\u2019s thoughts and his hand on Li Cangyu\u2019s shoulder tightened slightly like silent support.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The Chinese team brought more people to the interview. In addition to Li Cangyu and Ling Xuefeng, there were several other gods who played an important role in today\u2019s competition, Tan Shitian, Su Guangmo, Lou Wushuang and Jiang Xu.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu brought all these people in order to give the reporters a chance for a comprehensive interview before the finals.</p><br/><p>The domestic reporters were so excited that they immediately rushed to ask questions.</p><br/><p>\u201cCaptain Tan, were you under a lot of pressure when you lost today\u2019s first game?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo tell you the truth?\u201d Tan Shitian smiled and glanced at Li Cangyu. \u201cCat God had me open the match but I didn\u2019t feel too much psychological pressure. It is because I knew there were many great gods behind me and had confidence in them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe saw you comforting Vice-Captain Cheng after the first game. How is he feeling now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCheng Wei is a single-celled animal. His emotions come and go quickly.\u201d Tan Shitian\u2019s smile became gentler as he talked about Cheng Wei. \u201cOnce the first game was lost, his face fell like the sky. The moment the second game was won, he immediately came alive again. He had completely forgotten about the first game by the time the fourth game arrived.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Then Cheng Wei\u2019s memory was less than 10 minutes?</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei was watching the live broadcast and was unconvinced. \u201cCan Tan Shitian stop blackening me in every interview?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Time team\u2019s Lu Xiao whispered, \u201cIs he blackening you? He keeps spoiling you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei looked at him with confusion. \u201cLu Xiao, what are you whispering about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Xiao immediately waved his hand. \u201cNothing! Hahaha, I am reviewing this game!\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei ignored him and continued to watch the screen.</p><br/><p>In today\u2019s 3:1 match, the lost game was directed by Tan Shitian but he didn\u2019t seem to mind at all. In the interview, he was outspoken about the losing game and very graceful. His face was handsome, especially the enlarged version on the big screen. He was handsome and had an affable smile.</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei didn\u2019t realize that his gaze had been on someone\u2019s face for more than 10 seconds without moving away.</p><br/><p>\u201cLosing one or two games doesn\u2019t really matter. We can learn from the lost games and find out what we\u2019re missing. In fact, I lost the game I commanded today but I gained a lot from it. I believe that Cat God used this system to show you the strength of the new generation in the Chinese Miracle League.\u201d Tan Shitian answered with a smile. \u201cXiao Han, Zhuo Hang and Qin Mo are the future of our Miracle League.\u201d</p><br/><p>These words were endorsed by Li Cangyu. \u201cCaptain Tan is excellent. The lineup of the first game was based on temptation. My style is different from Captain Park and is more suitable for a steady play. Thus, I didn\u2019t send the strongest lineup in the first game. Captain Tan took some newcomers and got a score of 9:10. This is already great. If this lineup appears next year, I believe there will be a different ending!\u201d</p><br/><p>These words received warm applause from the reporters.</p><br/><p>It could be seen that Li Cangyu\u2019s eyes weren\u2019t only on the World Competition but on the future of the Miracle League.</p><br/><p>Xiao Han, Qin Mo and Zhuo Hang were players less than 18 years old. One day, they would become the pillars of the Miracle League and the national team would depend on them. Thus, it was a reasonable choice to give them more opportunities in the First World Competition.</p><br/><p>After interviewing Tan Shitian, a reporter asked Su Guangmo a question. \u201cCaptain Su didn\u2019t personally direct any of today\u2019s games but participated in a team battle as Cat God\u2019s teammate. Do you want to be a commander in the finals?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt depends on the captain\u2019s arrangement.\u201d Su Guangmo readily smiled. \u201cThe goal of all our national team\u2019s players is the same. The commander doesn\u2019t matter as long as we can win!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCaptain Lou played beautifully in today\u2019s underwater assassination and your cooperation with Vice-Captain Zhang has become more tacit. Many foreign reporters have given you the nickname of \u2018Cold Killer\u2019. What do you think about this nickname?\u201d The reporter shifted the question to Lou Wushuang.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s good.\u201d Lou Wushuang replied while pushing up his glasses.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Interviewing the cold king was a very difficult matter. The reporter was choked up for a while before asking, \u201cWhat does Captain Lou want to say to the domestic audience?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSee you in the finals.\u201d Lou Wushuang replied in a calm tone that didn\u2019t fluctuate.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d The reporters decided to give up on interviewing him and turned to Jiang Xu. \u201cCaptain Jiang and Zhuo Hang are partners from different teams. Based on today\u2019s semi-finals, your cooperation is excellent. Was it hard during the training to form a partnership with a newcomer?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFortunately, Zhuo Hang and I spent a lot of time in the arena on our side accounts. I don\u2019t feel that it is tiring and it is instead very interesting. The two of us might come from different teams but there is no sense of estrangement. This is because Zhuo Hang\u2019s level is very high and he immediately understands anything I say.\u201d Jiang Xu\u2019s tone was full of admiration for Zhuo Hang.</p><br/><p>Backstage, Zhuo Hang immediately took out his phone and sent a message. [Senior praised me.]</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang quickly replied: [I\u2019m watching the live broadcast.]</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang: [You must come watch the finals, you hear me?]</p><br/><p>[Yes, I\u2019ll come and cheer for you!]</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang put away his phone with a hint of a smile on his face. He didn\u2019t know if he would have a chance to play in the finals but Li Xiaojiang was his fixed partner. They should be in the same arena to witness it.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The reporters took turns interviewing and Ling Xuefeng received many questions, which was enough to show the popularity of Captain Ling.</p><br/><p>He replied in a very serious tone. The questions he didn\u2019t like then he would directly skip. The reporters were used to this man\u2019s tough style and naturally didn\u2019t dare keep asking.</p><br/><p>A reporter suddenly asked boldly, \u201cCaptain Ling, there is something I have always been curious about. In the World Competition so far, the commander is often changed depending on the lineup of the group battle. However, we have never seen you appear with Cat God in the same team battle. If you one day appear in the same battle as Cat God, who will be the commander?\u201d</p><br/><p>The question stunned many journalists and viewers.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu and Ling Xuefeng were the captain and vice-captain of the national team. As long as one of them played, the hearts of the audience members were particularly solid. Thus, almost everyone ignored this question. What if both of them played at the same time? What type of image would appear?</p><br/><p>The reporter\u2019s question ignited the curiosity of the crowd.</p><br/><p>Another reporter stood up and asked, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we have Cat God answer this question?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu and Ling Xuefeng glanced at each other before replying simultaneously, \u201cHe will command.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Then who the hell would command?</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t expect the connection to be to this degree. Ling Xuefeng gave a rare smile to the camera and said, \u201cWe usually discuss tactical issues and will negotiate to resolve any disagreements.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu nodded and continued, \u201cHowever, a game is different. The situation on the field changes rapidly and the opponent won\u2019t give us the opportunity to discuss it slowly. If there is one day where both of us appears in the group battle, one person must be the commander and the other person must absolutely obey orders.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng spoke decisively, \u201cIf there are differences on the field, I will listen to him because I believe in him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This simple sentence moved Li Cangyu\u2019s heart. To have a person who knew him, trusted him, supported him and was willing to join hands with him was God\u2019s greatest gift to him.</p><br/><p>The reporter asked excitedly, \u201cThen the last commander will be Cat God?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was no longer polite and smiled. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to worry too much about this matter. IN fact, if Xuefeng and I play the game, there is no need to give commands. With the tacit understanding between us, eye contact is enough. Of course, I will be in charge when necessary. Since Xuefeng said he would listen to me, shouldn\u2019t I give him some face?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Cat God said this but Captain Ling was still so cooperative. This scene was really rare!</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu joked before saying, \u201cMany people are concerned about who can win the championship. I want to see, the Chinese team will win!\u201d</p><br/><p>The captain\u2019s declaration caused the reporters to clap loudly.</p><br/><p>From the beginning, everyone had been aiming for the championship. They swept through the group stage with a victory record and they shockingly took down the South Korean rival team 3:1 in the semi-finals. Now that they had reached the finals and the championship trophy was right in front of them, everyone would definitely try their best to win the highest honour.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The interview ended and they returned backstage. The players watching the live broadcast were thrilled by Li Cangyu\u2019s last sentence. Everyone put their hands together and shouted, \u201cRefuel!\u201d They excitedly rode back to the Miracle Village.</p><br/><p>After returning to their room that evening, Li Cangyu sat on the sofa and closed his eyes tiredly.</p><br/><p>His expression was calm in front of the reporters and he pretended to be relaxed in front of the players. Now he no longer needed to disguise himself. He didn\u2019t know how many brain cells he lost in the match today. He was actually very tired and didn\u2019t want to open his eyes.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng looked at his \u2018collapsed on the sofa\u2019 posture and suppressed his smile. He sat next to Li Cangyu and helped massage his shoulder. His shoulder muscles were stiff from sitting in front of a computer for several hours. He felt very comfortable as they were massaged and pointed to his right shoulder. \u201cThis side as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t polite at all. LIng Xuefeng pressed on the left and right shoulder, his voice low and gentle, \u201cHave a good rest tonight. The tactics for the finals can be discussed another day. No matter the outcome of the finals, I will face it with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu heard this and suddenly opened his eyes.</p><br/><p>He was lying on the sofa and his angle of looking up was just right. The light was behind Ling Xuefeng and his face wasn\u2019t very clear, but his eyes were particularly deep and bright.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu\u2019s heart jerked and he took the initiative to extend his arms and hug the other person\u2019s neck, pulling this person towards himself. Ling Xuefeng followed and planted a gentle kiss on Li Cangyu\u2019s lips.</p><br/><p>\u2018No matter the result, you are with me.\u2019</p><br/><p>This sentence was the most long-lasting confession of life between them.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

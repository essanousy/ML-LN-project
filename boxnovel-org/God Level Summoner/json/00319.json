Annie and Holder, it is your turn to go on. Send them away as soon as possible and move back the disadvantage!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two named people immediately stepped forward.</p><br/><p>Annie replied firmly, \u201cCaptain, rest assured!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe white magician has only one layer of blood left and can easily be solved with one move.\u201d Holder shrugged. \u201cAs for the archer, he doesn\u2019t have much blue left and most of his skills are on cooldown. It isn\u2019t difficult to kill him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Holder\u2019s words were true but the bad feeling lingered in Stein\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>He always felt that the Chinese team\u2019s players weren\u2019t easy to kill even if they didn\u2019t have much blood left\u2026</p><br/><p>Of course, he was the captain and couldn\u2019t express this frustration in case he lowered the players\u2019 confidence. Stein took a deep breath and pretended to smile easily. He patted their shoulders and said, \u201cCome on, I\u2019ll leave it to you!\u201d</p><br/><p>The short break ended and the French players appeared.</p><br/><p>It was Annie\u2019s dark magician and Holder\u2019s summoner. This was a typical combination of control and output. They were also well known in France, with Holder\u2019s demon summoner ranked in the top 10 of the world.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu saw this lineup and glanced over at Ling Xuefeng. \u201cHave you played against Holder?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Ling Xuefeng paused before adding, \u201cHowever, he has a winning percentage of less than 40% against Jack.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jack Josh was the blood kin summoner of the American team and was as skilled as Ling Xuefeng.</p><br/><p>This meant that Holder\u2019s level was a lot worse than Ling Xuefeng.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian didn\u2019t have much blue and skills remaining but Li Cangyu believed that this talented player could increase the advantage on the field.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, Tan Shitian knew he couldn\u2019t survive long and didn\u2019t hesitate to use Death Arrow Rain as soon as he saw the two opponents.</p><br/><p>Annie\u2019s black magician fell to 75% blood but Holder reacted very quickly. He used the public pet, the guardian to block this wave and then summoned the black crows, opening Cover the Sky!</p><br/><p>The dense black crows covered the vision of Tan Cheng and then Holder summoned four skeleton infantry, manipulating them to rush at Tan Shitian!</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei was Annie\u2019s focus.</p><br/><p>Annie quickly moved forward and used two layers of Shadow Winding on Cheng Wei. Cheng Wei only had 5% blood left and this negative state was enough to make him lose blood and die.</p><br/><p>However, Cheng Wei didn\u2019t die in vain. He predicted that the other party\u2019s black magician had entered his attack range and used the last bit of blue to use Tidal Surge!</p><br/><p>In the case where his field of view was covered, the blind usage of the big move relied on memory and actually hit the two opponents. The unexpected operation caused the live broadcast room to be filled with: [Cheng Wei 6666!] [He is infected by Captain Tan and has become smart. It is really touching!]</p><br/><p>Kou Hongyi also exclaimed, \u201cI found that Cheng Wei is making rapid progress in this World Competition. He opened up the skill blindly and it precisely hit, indicating that he is very familiar with this map.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Bing agreed. \u201cCheng Wei used the big move Tidal Surge before he died. The two French players must be very depressed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Annie was really angry. She hadn\u2019t expected this 5% blood guy to be able to use a big move at the last moment. Tidal Surge not only decreased their health by 15%, it added the deadly deceleration effect!</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian saw this and couldn\u2019t help praising, \u201cXiao Wei is good!\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei was in a great mood after being praised. He might\u2019ve cursed by Annie\u2019s black magic but he helped Tan Shitian before he died, allowing Tan Shitian the opportunity to escape.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian didn\u2019t disappoint Cheng Wei. He used Flying Feather Steps to run deeper into the woods. The moment his vision was restored, Tan Shitian used Precise Aim and Shock Shot to force Annie\u2019s blood to 40%!</p><br/><p>Holder\u2019s skeletons finally caught up with him. They exploded and combined with Annie\u2019s black magic, Tan Shitian\u2019s blood fell to the dangerous 10% state.</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, Tan Shitian didn\u2019t give up. He used Flying Feather Steps to move through the woods and grasped the timing to fire Quenching Arrow. The freezing effect froze Annie and he followed up with several ordinary arrows, using these ordinary attacks to force Annie\u2019s blood to 30%.</p><br/><p>The survival ability of the Chinese team was so tenacious? Still refusing to die even with a bit of blood left?</p><br/><p>Holder couldn\u2019t bear it anymore and directly summoned the banshee to pull Tan Shitian over. Then he used the skeleton infantry to kill him.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian smiled as he looked over at Cheng Wei. He stood up and declared, \u201cOur mission is complete. We will leave it for the players after us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Cheng Wei happily followed him. \u201cThe early advantage we created is quite big. There is the Su Yu combination and then Captain Ling behind us. We will definitely win this game!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them walked back to the rest area. Once they encountered the Su Yu combination, Tan Shitian took the initiative to pat Su Guangmo\u2019s shoulder. \u201cCaptain Su, I\u2019ll hand it over to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo declared boldly, \u201cNo problem, just watch me!\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The short substitution period ended and the Chinese team\u2019s second stage combination appeared.</p><br/><p>MOMO and YUYU, the two IDs that deliberately sold meng belonged to the captain and vice-captain of the Flying Feathers team, Su Guangmo and Yu Pingsheng!</p><br/><p>Kou Hongyi exclaimed, \u201cThe Su Yu combination, it has been a while since we\u2019ve seen them in the arena!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Bing added, \u201cTwo melees playing against a magician and summoner is actually not very good but Captain Su\u2019s ability to advance is quite strong. In addition, Annie was consumed by Tan Shitian to 30% blood. The Su Yu combination should win as long as there are no accidents.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kou Hongyi suddenly found a new world and his eyes shone. \u201cI suddenly found that Cat God\u2019s lineup against the French team is particularly strong! In the group stage, he often sent Xiao Han and Zhuo Hang to practice. Today, from opening to present, the players were Cat Bai, Lou Zhang, Tan Cheng and Su Yu. All of them are combinations consisting of great gods!\u201d Kou Hongyi paused and added, \u201cIt seems that Cat God is really going all out against the French team.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter all, it is a knockout match and there is nothing wrong with it. Sending the ace combinations can ensure victory.\u201d Yu Bing thought about it. \u201cIn fact, the French team\u2019s overall strength is a bit worse than the Chinese team. It is currently the quarter-finals and if we win this match, we can advance to the semi-finals.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kou Hongyi\u2019s expression became serious when he heard this. \u201cSister Bing\u2019s words are right. The e-sports team that can compete with us in the World Competition are South Korea and the United States. It will be hard to fight if we meet South Korea or the United States! This match against the French team, from beginning to the present, the advantage is actually very obvious.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Su Yu combination going against two ranged classes shouldn\u2019t have an advantage but the other side\u2019s black magician was at 30% blood. It shouldn\u2019t be difficult to take care of them.</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo was a very fierce melee player who often rushed towards the opponent\u2019s face with his big sword. This time, he still showed his tough style and directly rushed to Holder. He used Light and Shadow Rotation to directly kill Holder\u2019s skeleton infantry and banshee.</p><br/><p>This action surprised many viewers. Annie was in a residual blood state and the average person would kill her first. On the other hand, Su Guangmo attacked the full of blood demon summoner and killed his pets.</p><br/><p>Annie quickly used Dark Fear to control Su Guangmo but this didn\u2019t pose much threat to him. It was because Holder\u2019s pet skeletons and banshees were killed. He could at best summon the demon god. The demon god\u2019s explosive ability wasn\u2019t strong if it was alone.</p><br/><p>The demon god\u2019s group attack combined with the black magician\u2019s Hell Flames and Death Mantra forced Su Guangmo\u2019s blood to 60%.</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng saw that his brother was being beaten and directly rushed to Annie. He used Mountain Chop followed by Splitting Bone Chop and World Without Justice.</p><br/><p>The golden light effect enveloped Annie\u2019s body and the huge axe swept in a 360 degree range, lowering the fragile black magician\u2019s blood to the bottom!</p><br/><p>Annie was killed.</p><br/><p>At this time, SU Guangmo lifted the negative fear state and turned to join his younger brother. The two men moved forward and surrounded the demon summoner Holder. Su Guangmo\u2019s hands were precise and unpredictable. He stunned the other side with Spirit Lock and followed up with Breaking Bone Sword and Devouring Soul Sword. Yu Pingsheng wasn\u2019t idle and cooperated with his brother.</p><br/><p>Being close to two melees at the same time was definitely a nightmare for a ranged class.</p><br/><p>Su Yu\u2019s play was quite violent and it was similar to cutting vegetables.</p><br/><p>The sword and axe had incomparable understanding.</p><br/><p>The silver sword and golden axe intertwined in a gorgeous light and shadow effect, cutting Holder\u2019s blood to 15% at a dazzling speed.</p><br/><p>Holder had only a trace of blood left and became very anxious, but most of his pets were on cooldown. He found it hard to wait until the skeleton infantry\u2019s cooldown was over and then immediately summoned four of them, trapping Su Yu in place and taking the opportunity to break away from their encirclement.</p><br/><p>This set of moves was wonderful but unfortunately, it was too late.</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo was imprisoned by the skeletons and decisively broke out to kill them. Then he raised the giant sword and chased Holder\u2019s back with a fierce Storm Sword!</p><br/><p>The bloody Holder was directly stabbed to death\u2026</p><br/><p>The domestic audience went crazy. [Captain Su is so handsome!] [Our Captain Su is so handsome and directly rushes to your face. He doesn\u2019t try to reason with you. This is worthy of our Terran Emperor!]</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo killed his opponent and turned back to his younger brother with a handsome smile. \u201cIt was a bit easy to win.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng thought about it seriously and said, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo knew his brother didn\u2019t like to talk and didn\u2019t say anything else. He continued staring at the computer screen to prepare for the next stage.</p><br/><p>He had actually been prepared for a few minutes of fierce fighting when preparing for the second stage. Unexpectedly, the French team\u2019s black magician and summoner made some small mistakes.</p><br/><p>For example, the black magician Annie should\u2019ve opened the distance instead of rushing to control him with Dark Fear. She wasn\u2019t cautious about her position, allowing Yu Pingsheng to counterattack and kill her in seconds.</p><br/><p>For example, Holder used too many skills against Tan Shitian and Cheng Wei and it was hard to pose a threat as soon as his pets died.</p><br/><p>The French team\u2019s combination suffered a great loss and this was clearly related to their 6v4 defeat in the first game. Six people couldn\u2019t win against four people. This definitely dealt a big blow to the players\u2019 confidence.</p><br/><p>Cat God\u2019s tactical arrangement was truly very frightening and directly collapsed the French team. The French team\u2019s players were psychologically affected and the pressure on them was relatively high. Once Tan Shitian created the advantage again, they couldn\u2019t remain calm. Even good players were prone to mistakes when they were under great psychological pressure.</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo and Yu Pingsheng were both excellent at catching the opponents\u2019 mistakes and decisively seized the opportunity to kill the other side.</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo\u2019s thoughts were also Ling Xuefeng\u2019s thoughts.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng saw this and couldn\u2019t help saying to Li Cangyu, \u201cHolder only played at 70% of his level and was obviously too impetuous. The French team seems unstable. Is it because you were too fierce in the first game?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu calmly replied, \u201cI have to be serious in the knockouts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng helplessly told him, \u201cIf you are even more serious then they will crash.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled and didn\u2019t say anything else.</p><br/><p>In fact, he didn\u2019t need to send the luxurious lineup of Cat Bai, Lou Zhang, Tan Cheng and Su Yu to the arena against the French team. He could let the rookies Xiao Han and Xiao Zhuo continue practicing.</p><br/><p>However, Captain Stein\u2019s arrogant words when they meet backstage made Li Cangyu somewhat uncomfortable?</p><br/><p>What did he mean by it was better to not meet in the knockouts? His eyes were looking above and the Chinese team would lose if they met?</p><br/><p>The unhappy Li Cangyu didn\u2019t want to be polite with the French team and directly used an all-star lineup to teach France a little lesson.</p><br/><p>People who were arrogant in front of Cat God would never have a good end!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

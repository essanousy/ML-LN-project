He had just gone backstage when he saw Qin Mo and Ling Xuefeng walking towards Li Cangyu. Ling Xuefeng took the initiative to say, \u201cToday you played very well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu pretended to be serious. \u201cThank you for Captain Ling\u2019s praise.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng smiled slightly. He had scruples due to the teammates present and didn\u2019t do anything special. He just patted Li Cangyu on the shoulder and said, \u201cI will be leading the team back to Shanghai tomorrow. The next time we meet, it will be the Wind Colour match against Canglan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu looked at him earnestly. \u201cI won\u2019t be polite to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng also stared him in the eyes, equally earnest. \u201cI won\u2019t be polite to you either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled and took the initiative to extend his arms for a hug. \u201cSee you on the field.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were each other\u2019s most cherished lovers but the game was related to the honour of the entire team. No one could show mercy, regardless of personal feelings. This was a principle that all e-sports players should have.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was well aware that the match against Wind Colour would be the toughest in the regular season. He wasn\u2019t worried about the match against Ling Xuefeng. Rather, he was looking forward to the direct confrontation between them that had somehow been avoided for six years. In the seventh season of the Miracle Professional League, they would fulfill this wish.</p><br/><p>Qin Mo waited here with his master because he wanted to say a few words to Xiao Han. The young teenagers looked at each other and consciously came together. Qin Mo whispered in Xiao Han\u2019s ear, \u201cIn future interviews, don\u2019t be straightforward and tell everything to the reporters. Understood?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han looked at him doubtfully. \u201cWhat does straightforward mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mo rolled his eyes and explained, \u201cIt means you are too direct and honest!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Xiao Han nodded thoughtfully before wondering, \u201cIsn\u2019t honesty a good quality?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Qin Mo felt it was too hard to communicate with this person whose brain circuits were different from ordinary people. He gave up trying to convince Xiao Han and changed the topic, \u201cCough, when you talked today, you used too many related words.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han looked at him innocently. \u201cRelated words can make the sentence more complete. This is what you taught me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Qin Mo almost coughed up blood.</p><br/><p>They could make the sentence more complete but there was no need to use them all in one sentence!</p><br/><p>Qin Mo took a deep breath and endured the impulse to hit him on the head. \u201cYou can\u2019t use it too much or it will be cumbersome. You can watch the TV dramas and see how they talk\u2026 Forget it, I can\u2019t tell you what to say.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han continued to watch him innocently with clear black eyes while golden hair hung over his ears. The beautiful mixed-race teenager make people want to rub his head\u2026</p><br/><p>Qin Mo didn\u2019t dare do this action. He guiltily looked away and said, \u201cDon\u2019t tell reporters in the future that Qin Mo is your good best friend.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han wondered, \u201cIsn\u2019t it true?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mo felt that he was going crazy. \u201cThe good best friend is repeating words. You only need one of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han suddenly realized. \u201cOh, then I should say you are my good friend?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mo was silent for a moment before scratching his head with embarrassment. \u201cKeep the other word.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBest friend?\u201d</p><br/><p>The satisfied Qin Mo suppressed a smile and nodded. \u201cThis is more like it.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, Ling Xuefeng suddenly said, \u201cQin Mo, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mo glanced over at Xiao Han. \u201cNext time we will be meeting in Shanghai. Have you been to Shanghai before?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll show you around.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han suggested seriously, \u201cOnce I beat you on the field, take me to play.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mo, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn it, I want to have a real PK with him! Who said that you will beat me? Don\u2019t cry and beg for mercy when the time comes.\u2019</p><br/><p>Qin Mo scoffed and said, \u201cPerhaps I will beat you. Prepare well for the next game and don\u2019t tell people that I\u2019m your sparring partner!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mo calmed down and waved his hand. \u201cGoodbye.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGoodbye.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu saw the two little guys seriously saying goodbye and patted Xiao Han on the shoulder. \u201cDo you think it is useful to have Qin Mo teach you Chinese?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han thought about it in a distressed manner. \u201cI think it is a bit useful? At least I know many related words and I know what context means.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu laughed. \u201cNever mind, learn slowly. However, he is right. You can\u2019t be so straightforward in future interviews. Saying that Master killed you down to your underwear\u2026 well, don\u2019t you know that Master chased you for your own good?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>He thought there was something wrong with the logic of \u2018chasing you for your own good\u2019 but he knew that Master was always right.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu\u2019s quartet arrived at the restaurant. Zhang Jueming and the others had already ordered the dishes. The eight people sat around the table and chatted with excited expressions. The fact that they could win two games at an away match made everyone feel satisfied.</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang and Li Xiaojiang hadn\u2019t played well in the arena but the Shu Bai combination reversed the situation and Canglan ultimately didn\u2019t lose points. Gu Siming\u2019s performance today wasn\u2019t great but Li Cangyu didn\u2019t hurry to scold him. It was because Xiao Gu clearly realized the shortcomings of his impulsiveness and this would be improved in the next match.</p><br/><p>The meal ended in a happy atmosphere. Everyone returned to the hotel by car. Li Cangyu told everyone to rest early because they would catch a flight back to Changsha tomorrow.</p><br/><p>For the away games, the rooms were arranged as Li Cangyu and Xiao Han, Xiao Gu and Old Zhang, Zhuo and Li, and Shu and Bai. This arrangement was to facilitate the exchange between combinations.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan had no opinions on this room arrangement. Ah Shu didn\u2019t snore or have any other bad habits. Apart from his love of praise, it was quite good to live together.</p><br/><p>However, after returning today, Xie Shurong seemed somewhat abnormal. He didn\u2019t hang around Bai Xuan or ask the vice-captain to reward him with a plate of ribs. Instead, he sat quietly on his bed and looked down seriously at his iPad.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan also ignored him and went to the bathroom to wash up.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t realize that the game interface on Xie Shurong\u2019s iPad was already showing game over!</p><br/><p>The sound of water from the bathroom made Xie Shurong uneasy. In the past, he only needed to move his fingers to clear the game but today he failed repeatedly. He closed his iPad with some irritation and pricked his ears to listen to the movements in the bathroom.</p><br/><p>He thought of that gentle-looking man taking a shower, water drops dripping down his body and Xie Shurong\u2019s heartbeat accelerated!</p><br/><p>He looked down to check the time but found that his wrist was empty. Xie Shurong was stunned and remembered that when he had washed his hands, he took off the watch and placed it next to him. This was a birthday gift from his mother. It was very expensive but not very waterproof. Xie Shurong thought this and immediately got up to get back his watch.</p><br/><p>However, Bai Xuan was in the shower\u2026</p><br/><p>Or should he take a peek when getting his watch?</p><br/><p>Once this evil thought popped up, it was like a small flame that suddenly burst. It burned all over his body and he couldn\u2019t bear it anymore. Xie Shurong went to the bathroom and took a deep breath to keep himself calm. Then he gently knocked on the door and asked, \u201cVice-Captain Bai, my watch is inside. Can I come in and take it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan\u2019s gentle voice was soon heard. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong stepped in and thought he could see the beautiful scene of a beauty washing up. The result\u2026 damn! The shower was blocked by frosted glass. The designer of this hotel room simply had no brains!</p><br/><p>Vice-Captain Bai was taking a shower with the glass door closed and the frosted glass blocked most of his body. Xie Shurong could only see a faint outline.</p><br/><p>However, this outline showed that Bai Xuan\u2019s figure was excellent, especially his pair of long legs\u2026</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan turned off the nozzle and asked doubtfully, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Did you find it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Cough, I found my watch.\u201d Xie Shurong coughed awkwardly, picked up his watch on the sink and fled.</p><br/><p>After returning to the room, Xie Shurong took a deep breath to calm his heartbeat. Was he really a devil? He had been to a public bathhouse before and he didn\u2019t feel anything at the sight of many people squeezed together in the bath. However, today when he saw Bai Xuan\u2019s blurred back, he was so excited that his body became hot.</p><br/><p>This was so strange. Did he like Bai Xuan?</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong shook his head and felt that his IQ wasn\u2019t enough.</p><br/><p>He sat on the bed and started to carefully recall the details of what he knew about Bai Xuan. When he was young, he chased Bai Xuan and killed him 10 times. When they shook hands in the soundproof room, he felt that this man was very gentle but his impression of Bai Xuan wasn\u2019t deep.</p><br/><p>Later, after meeting Cat God and Bai Xuan in New York, he found that not only did Bai Xuan have a good temper but also excellent cooking skills. Bai Xuan usually liked to smile and he made people feel warm and gentle. He would show his sorrow and frown because of his stomach problems. He also steadfastly declared that they would return to Miracle together.</p><br/><p>That vague image gradually became clearer in Xie Shurong\u2019s mind, making Xie Shurong want to get along with Bai Xuan and become closer to him.</p><br/><p>In particular, he always felt that Bai Xuan was warm and soft when hugging him. It was more comfortable than the big pillow Xie Shurong slept with every day, making Xie Shurong reluctant to let go.</p><br/><p>He thought there was nothing wrong with this until today when he found himself wanting to peek at Bai Xuan washing up\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong jumped into bed and covered his face with a pillow.</p><br/><p>God, why did it seem like he had the negative IQ of a pervert?</p><br/><p>This was the scene that Bai Xuan saw after coming out of the bedroom. Xie Shurong had covered his head with a pillow and was rolling around the bed\u2026 rolling around\u2026</p><br/><p>It was unknown how many times he rolled back and forth. Bai Xuan couldn\u2019t help smiling at these childish actions and took out his phone to take a small video. Then he went to the bed and gently touched Xie Shurong\u2019s head. \u201cXie Shurong, are you exercising on the bed?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong heard this and suddenly stopped like he pressed the brakes. Xie Shurong\u2019s face was red as he turned over and saw Bai Xuan\u2019s smile.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan wondered, \u201cWhy are you blushing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I\u2026 I\u2019m too hot!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he ran away from Bai Xuan into the bathroom.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong saw his red face in the mirror and angrily slammed his fist against the sink. Why couldn\u2019t he be more mature in front of Bai Xuan? Blushing? What was good about blushing? Was it necessary to be so nervous after discovering that he liked Bai Xuan?</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong washed his face with cold water to lower the heat on his face.</p><br/><p>This was his first love and it was natural to be nervous. He understood the excitement of liking a person for the first time.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong smiled into the mirror and touched his chin while thinking, \u2018I am handsome even when blushing? I don\u2019t know if Vice-Captain Bai likes this type of handsome person? I will wash the dishes, warm the bed, ship packages to your door and not waste money! All my wealth will be yours!\u2019</p><br/>\n</div>"}

There were players like Captain Ling and Cat God practicing seriously, how could other people be so lazy?</p><br/><p>One hour of basic training passed quickly. Next was time for the arena. Li Cangyu stood up and told them, \u201cThe fixed combinations of each team just have to maintain their understanding. In the national team, everyone should try other combinations. The players we meet at the World Competition will surely have a variety of players. We should play with different partners to enrich our experience.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want to combine with someone, register the group. Once the groups have finished being decided, we will play in the arena.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone immediately logged into the Q group and Cheng Wei came forward first. [I want to team up with Cat God! Please satisfy the wish of your fan O(\u2229_\u2229)O.]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu looked at his expression of selling meng and couldn\u2019t help smiling. [Okay, I will fulfill your wish.]</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong asked: [Brother, do you want to come with me? Take care of the younger brother you\u2019ve abandoned for all these years.]</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo wondered, [Which brother are you calling?]</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong: [My oldest apprentice brother.]</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo turned to Yu Pingsheng. \u201cThen I will try it with Ah Shu. Who do you want to form a team with?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng thought for a long time before finally managing to say a name. \u201cMeng Jiejie.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Jie turned at the sound of her ID. \u201cDid you call me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng smiled shyly and asked, \u201cTeam?\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Jie had a decisive nature and nodded. \u201cNo problem!\u201d</p><br/><p>The people around them, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t this style too wrong? Meng Jie was straightforward and heroic while Vice-Captain Yu could barely say a word\u2026</p><br/><p>Guo Xuan saw this and couldn\u2019t help moving. [Sister Muzi, do you want to team up? How about we try a black and white magician alliance?]</p><br/><p>The lively Yang Muzi immediately agreed. [Good! I haven\u2019t played this combination yet.]</p><br/><p>Yan Ruiwen smiled. [Vice-Captain Bai, how about we team up? The vice-captains of Wind Colour and Canglan haven\u2019t cooperated yet.]</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan easily promised: [No problem.]</p><br/><p>Xiao Han followed up with: [The little princes of Wind Colour and Canglan should also form a group.]</p><br/><p>Qin Mo was excited. [Yes!]</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang @Jiang Xu and asked: [Senior, do you want to guide me? Shall we try the combination of two hunters?]</p><br/><p>Jiang Xu: [Yes.]</p><br/><p>Time\u2019s captain Tan Shitian invited Red Fox\u2019s captain Liu Xiang. [Captain Liu, do you want to give me face? I also want to try the feeling of taking a milk mother with me.]</p><br/><p>He had debuted in the same season as Liu Xiang. Among the captains present, they were the youngest and naturally chatted together. Liu Xiang saw this and responded: [Okay Captain Tan, I will look after your blood.]</p><br/><p>Zhu Qingyue of Pure Cleansing saw this and couldn\u2019t help saying weakly: [Cat God is truly the expert at demolition. Almost all the fixed combinations in the national team have been broken apart by you  ]</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei jumped out: [Xiao Zhu, cry to Cat God and he might change his mind!]</p><br/><p>Zhu Qingyue sent a row of tearful expressions.</p><br/><p>Then Chu Yan spoke: [The demolition is very good but the Ghost Spirits combination hasn\u2019t been torn apart yet.]</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui replied: [No one wants to team up with us. Is it because assassins are harder to team up with?]</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng suddenly came up. [I will be with Captain Lou. Vice-Captain Zhang, do you want to try it with Lu Xiao?]</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui immediately agreed. [No problem!]</p><br/><p>The demolition expert\u2019s achievement of tearing apart all combinations was finally reached. Li Cangyu smiled and said, [I will bring a team and Xuefeng will bring a team. Everyone is free to join one of them. We will play the KOF style.]</p><br/><p>People immediately selected a team.</p><br/><p>Apart from the two auxiliary psychics of Pure Cleansing, who wouldn\u2019t play for the time being, the other 20 people were divided into teams of team. The five pairs on each other would start the PK according to the KOF elimination style.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu built a room and selected the seven star high difficulty maps of the World Competition, setting it to random mode.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu and Cheng Wei pressed ready. Their first opponents were Ling Xuefeng and Lou Wushuang, while the others observed.</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei was very excited at teaming up with Cat God as he waited for the map to load.</p><br/><p>The map that appeared was the seven star map previously seen before. The deceleration map tested the accuracy of the player\u2019s skill release in the low-speed state.</p><br/><p>The Cat Wei combination had been seen at the Carnival while the Ling Xuefeng and Lou Wushuang combination was fresh. Many great gods watched this game from a spectator\u2019s perspective.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng and Lou Wushuang were both cool-type players and didn\u2019t communicate much. As soon as they appeared on the map, Lou Wushuang used the normal stealth skill of a blood kin player. He quickly lurked behind Cheng Wei while Ling Xuefeng would use his skeleton infantry to control Li Cangyu.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu\u2019s instincts were very keen. He saw Ling Xuefeng coming over and immediately used Flying Feather Steps to slide away a few metres. Sure enough, Ling Xuefeng used Cover the Sky at this moment!</p><br/><p>The black crows flew in their faces and Cheng Wei\u2019s screen was blacked out. However, Li Cangyu wasn\u2019t affected because he avoided it in time.</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang took advantage of this and struck Cheng Wei with Pain Blade. Still, Cheng Wei wasn\u2019t silly. The moment he became blind, he jumped a few steps forward and directly avoided Lou Wushuang\u2019s control.</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo joked on the public channel: [Did Xiao Wei\u2019s hand slip and he pressed the wrong key?]</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian retorted: [Don\u2019t underestimate our vice-captain. How can his awareness not sense this?]</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei couldn\u2019t see the words on the public channel. At this time, his screen was still black. He just guessed that Lou Wushuang would definitely take the time to attack him so he blindly jumped forward and happened to dodge this skill.</p><br/><p>A moment later, his vision was restored and Cheng Wei used the previous prepared God\u2019s Seal to control Ling Xuefeng in front. The other party had long guessed this and summoned a skeleton in front of him, accurately blocking Cheng Wei\u2019s sealing skill.</p><br/><p>Both sides avoided the control. It was as good as an official match!</p><br/><p>The people watching couldn\u2019t help sighing with admiration. They didn\u2019t expect that the national team\u2019s casual game could be at the same level as the season\u2019s finals. It could be seen that everyone was particularly serious about this training.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng and Li Cangyu privately had a honey-like relationship but they didn\u2019t have the name of the \u2018strongest opponent\u2019 for nothing. In the blink of an eye, the two people used their big moves. Ling Xuefeng used the demon god to smash Li Cangyu\u2019s health down to 50% and Li Cangyu ruthlessly used the fire spirit and thunder spirit to smash Ling Xuefeng.</p><br/><p>At a critical moment, Lou Wushuang suddenly became invisible and moved to Cheng Wei at the fastest speed. He unleashed a series of combos and directly took Cheng Wei\u2019s head!</p><br/><p>Captain Lou\u2019s fierce and calm attacks made everyone\u2019s backs cold.</p><br/><p>It was the first captain of Ghost Spirits who created the \u2018assassination style but the one who was widely recognized for it and won the championship in front of everyone was his apprentice Lou Wushuang.</p><br/><p>This man had a calmness that was beyond ordinary people and his eyes were like a cold snake. His body temperature was lower than normal people and he could only say that his personality was a perfect fit for this \u2018assassin\u2019 class.</p><br/><p>Previously, he was sick and eliminated from the national team\u2019s trials but fortunately, he survived the danger. Today\u2019s arena game proved Lou Wushuang\u2019s strength. He was definitely the best assassin of the league.</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei was a bit depressed but the arena was like this. He accidentally let the other person seize an opportunity and was killed by Lou Wushuang. He had nothing to complain about.</p><br/><p>[Cat God, come on!] Cheng Wei typed on the public channel.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu had no time to pay attention to anyone else. Previously, Lou Wushuang had been beaten to residual blood by Cheng Wei and it wasn\u2019t difficult to kill the other person. However, Ling Xuefeng had three types of pets and Li Cangyu\u2019s thunder and wind spirit\u2019s moves had been used.</p><br/><p>The desperate Li Cangyu had to call the water spirit and wanted to rely on it to slowly grind Ling Xuefeng.</p><br/><p>However, Ling Xuefeng was very smart his time. He wasn\u2019t killed by Li Cangyu as he was in the seventh season\u2019s finals. The moment that the other person summoned the water spirit, he immediately realized what Li Cangyu was doing and used Witch Demon\u2019s Curse to forcibly bring Li Cangyu forward!</p><br/><p>This reaction speed made the onlookers feel amazed.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was pulled over and couldn\u2019t escape. Ling Xuefeng summoned the skeleton infantry and used continuous Skeleton Explosions to clear the other person\u2019s blood.</p><br/><p>[Victory!]</p><br/><p>This time Ling Xuefeng won against Li Cangyu, which could be considered making up for the loss in the finals.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu didn\u2019t mind. He smiled and sent a row of thumbs up. [Your reactions are fast!]</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng asked: [Did you want to use the same method a second time?]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu: [I can only use it on you once but I can try it again on foreigners.]</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng agreed. [That is fine.]</p><br/><p>Everyone, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The captain and vice-captain were chatting? They were waiting for the game to continue!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

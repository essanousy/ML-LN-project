They lost to Italy 1:2. If they lost to the Chinese team, they would definitely have no hope of reaching the next stage. Thus, in these two days, Rodriguez carefully studied the lineup of the Chinese team.</p><br/><p>The Mechanical City was chosen for China\u2019s match against Australia. The Spanish team naturally went to the Intranet to practice and found that the Mechanical City was too complicated. The Spanish team divided into two groups to play the death racing mode. It took only a few hours for them to understand the upper and lower floors. As the commander, Rodriguez felt his brain bursting from pain.</p><br/><p>What the hell were these messy mechanisms?</p><br/><p>The Mechanical City absolutely must be banned. Competing with the Chinese team on such a complicated map was simply asking to lose!</p><br/><p>This was common knowledge among all members of the Spanish team.</p><br/><p>This was why Rodriguez decisively banned the Mechanical City in the selection stage. Mount Huangshan Plank Road might be a strange map but at least there were nos strange mechanisms. It was just a death map! A death map wasn\u2019t uncommon in Miracle and it should be much better than the Mechanical City.</p><br/><p>There were six maps left. Mount Huangshan Plank Road couldn\u2019t be banned and the remaining five maps were Las Ventas Bullring, Madrid Palace and Demon Forest, Frost Temple and Endless Sea provided by the official Miracle database.</p><br/><p>Rodriguez considered for a moment and banned Endless Sea. There were too many variables if there were two death maps. Mount Huangshan Plank Road was already enough for their heads to ache.</p><br/><p>After the Spanish team banned the map, it was time for the captain of the Chinese team, Li Cangyu.</p><br/><p>There were five maps left. Which three were he going to leave behind?</p><br/><p>Kou Hongyi said, \u201cIn the last game against Australia, Cat God left both of Australia\u2019s maps in a handsome manner. Will he release the Spanish bullring and Madrid Palace?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Bing calmly analyzed, \u201cThe bullring map appeared in Spain\u2019s last map against Italy. This map was selected for the economic battle.\u201d</p><br/><p>As commentators, the two of them paid attention to the matches of other countries. Kou Hongyi heard this and smiled. \u201cIt seems the possibility of Cat God leaving the bullring behind is fairly high. After all, this map has already appeared and the Chinese team members have probably practiced it on the Intranet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it isn\u2019t difficult to fight an economic battle on the bullring map.\u201d Yu Bing continued, \u201cThe other map, Madrid Palace is a famous attraction in Spain. From the thumbnail shown, the designers should\u2019ve preserved the shape of the palace and transformed it internally. If I guessed correctly, this might be a complicated labyrinth map. Will Cat God leave it?\u201d</p><br/><p>As they spoke, Li Cangyu decisively banned Demon Forest and Frost Temple. He once again disabled the official Miracle maps and released the two maps submitted by Spain!</p><br/><p>Kou Hongyi couldn\u2019t help giving a thumbs up. \u201cI suddenly found that Cat God really seems like a general sitting there! He continues to release the maps submitted by the enemies. This is proper confidence!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Bing also couldn\u2019t suppress her smile. \u201cIt seems that we guessed it correctly. Cat God dared to release the two Spanish maps. At the very least, he is very confident about the bullring map that already appeared. As long as China can win two games, there is no pressure on them qualifying in the group stage.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Chinese team won against Australia. If they won against Spain, they would definitely move onto the next round.</p><br/><p>Everyone was more concerned about whether the Chinese team could qualify as first in the group stage, so that they could face the second place team in Group D.</p><br/><p>The two captains finished making their choices and the big screen zoomed in on the three maps selected for the match\u2014Mount Huangshan Plank Road, Las Ventas Bullring and Madrid Royal Palace.</p><br/><p>Next was the first game in arena mode and the system randomly arrived on the Mount Huangshan Plank Road map!</p><br/><p>The domestic audience cheered in the comments: [Mount Huangshan Plank Road, it is very thrilling at first glance!] [I think the captain of the Spanish team will surely regret this decision!] [Was there a saying? A trip to China\u2019s Five Sacred Mountains makes seeing other mountains unnecessary, a trip to Mount Huangshan makes seeing the Five Sacred Mountains unnecessary. Mount Huangshan is a very dangerous mountain!] [I\u2019ve climbed Mount Huangshan and stood at the highest road. Once I stood at the top, my legs were soft\u2026]</p><br/><p>Most of the domestic audience members were gloating and many lit candles for the Spanish team.</p><br/><p>The Spanish captain Rodriguez wasn\u2019t familiar with Chinese geography. He sat in the rest area and saw the landscape map that was released on the screen.</p><br/><p>The map projection on the screen using the 3d god\u2019s perspective, which was more comprehensive and wider than the map perspective that players saw in the game. Therefore, the Spanish team could see the full majestic of Mount Huangshan as well as the thrill and stimulation of the airwalk.</p><br/><p>The Spanish players, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone made stunned expressions while Rodriguez stared with surprise. He had long guessed that Mount Huangshan Plank Road was a death map and also guessed that it should be related to air combat. He didn\u2019t expect the plank roads to be so narrow. If they carelessly fell off, there was only a cliff below them and they would fall to the death!</p><br/><p>A player with a fear of heights would definitely get soft legs on this map!</p><br/><p>Even if there wasn\u2019t a fear of heights, walking on a plank road with a width of less than one metre was too easy to slip off!</p><br/><p>In addition, most of the Spanish players were melee and had short legs.</p><br/><p>Rodriguez felt unbearable.</p><br/><p>He thought it would\u2019ve been better to choose the Mechanical City. There might be many traps but at least it wouldn\u2019t be as frightening!</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Inside the Chinese team\u2019s soundproof room, Li Cangyu looked at Mount Huangshan Plank Road and chattered with Ling Xuefeng next to him. \u201cHave you ever been to Mount Huangshan? Looking down from a god\u2019s point of view, the land is really dangerous!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng replied, \u201cI have never been there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu said, \u201cThere will be opportunities to mountain climb together in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei actively raised his hand. \u201cI want to go too! Bring me with you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian turned back to him and said, \u201cCan you climb?\u2019</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei smiled and replied, \u201cIf I can\u2019t climb then I can move using the cable car!\u201d</p><br/><p>The group discussed the issue of climbing Mount Huangshan and there were no traces of nervousness on their faces.</p><br/><p>They had practiced on this map countless times during domestic training. At the beginning, everyone felt their airs rising just standing on the road. There was a cliff to the right and the abyss to the left. The width of the plank road was only around one metre. If they looked forward, there were clouds like a wonderland and faint green hills behind the clouds.</p><br/><p>Poor with poor psychologically quality would definitely be affected by such a map.</p><br/><p>Some of the national team members with a mild fear of heights hated this map. After many training sessions, they gradually overcame the psychological obstacles. Now that they were at the World Competition and looking at the Mount Huangshan Plank Road map, everyone felt a type of pride.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The panoramic display of the map soon finished and the found game officially began.</p><br/><p>The lineup for both sides appeared on the big screen at the same time. The first stage of the Spanish team was the combination of two swordsmen. The first stage for the Chinese team was played by Old Cat and Zhu\u2014it was the Li Cangyu and Zhu Qingyue combination!</p><br/><p>The audience was very curious about this fresh combination. [Little crybaby and Cat God!] [A psychic isn\u2019t very useful in the arena. What does it mean for Cat God to play with a small crybaby?] [The little crybaby no longer cries. Don\u2019t blacken him!]</p><br/><p>The domestic audience directly called him \u2018little crybaby\u2019 instead of Zhu Qingyue.</p><br/><p>In the soundproof room, Zhu Qingyue and Li Cangyu walked to the players\u2019 seat from now. The expression on Zhu Qingyue\u2019s face was very relaxed. Li Cangyu whispered a few words to him. He nodded seriously and then placed his fingers on the keyboard.</p><br/><p>After seeing this scene, Yu Bing couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cThis is the first time we are seeing the partnership of Cat God and Xiao Zhu. A summoner and a psychic\u2026 in fact, this isn\u2019t a very good combination. Cat God must\u2019ve brought Xiao Zhu to play in order to let him adapt to the atmosphere of the World Competition. This way he will be in a good state for the next game against the Italian team.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kou Hongyi agreed., \u201cSister Bing\u2019s analysis makes sense. Perhaps Cat God knows his partnership with Xiao Zhu isn\u2019t stable, which is why he played in the first stage. There is no need to worry since there will definitely be an ace combination in the guard stage!\u201d</p><br/><p>The players on both sides were ready and the map of Mount Huangshan Plank Road started to load.</p><br/><p>Then the four people refreshed on the map at the same time. Li Cangyu and Zhu Qingyue were in the lower parts of the plank road while the Spanish members were in the upper parts of the plank road. Mount Huangshan Plank Road had a very thrilling slope. The slope was more than 45 degrees and the narrow passage made it more difficult for people to play underneath. Still, this was good for Li Cangyu and Zhu Qingyue.</p><br/><p>The two members of the Spanish team glanced at the abyss next to them. Their backs were cold but they still quickly headed down.</p><br/><p>The two sides met in the middle of the plank road. The Spanish swordsman immediately used Spirit Lock on the psychic Zhu Qingyue! The other swordsman also used the Spirit Lock skill at the summoner Li Cangyu!</p><br/><p>The two people divided the labour and their cooperation was extremely tacit. This was because they were actually from the same team.</p><br/><p>After seeing that Li Cangyu and Zhu Qingyue were about to be controlled, it was fortunate that Li Cangyu responded with great speed. He summoned the fire spirit in front of Xiao Zhu and the swordsman\u2019s control skill was successfully blocked. Li Cangyu sacrificed the fire spirit to save Zhu Qingyue.</p><br/><p>Then he cleverly moved to the side with Flying Feather Steps to escape the skill in a thrilling manner!</p><br/><p>The audience found that Li Cangyu had stepped on the edge of the cliff. He was only 10 centimeters away from falling but after avoiding the control skill, he once again cleverly swung around and returned to the middle of the plank road.</p><br/><p>Cat God used precise positioning on the edge of the cliff, causing even the two commentators to be shocked and speechless. The domestic audience members were even more gobsmacked. After a few seconds of sluggishness, a large number of flowers frantically filled the live broadcast room.</p><br/><p>This was the captain of the national team!</p><br/><p>On the thrilling Mount Huangshan Plank Road, he was able to achieve such precise and accurate positioning.</p><br/><p>The even more frightening thing was while hiding from the opponent\u2019s control, he could also summon the fire spirit to help Xiao Zhu with Spirit Lock. The audience really had to admire it!</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Zhu, walk carefully.\u201d Li Cangyu spoke on the voice channel. \u201cGo behind me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Qingyue\u2019s palms were sweating. He expected Cat God to fall and the result was that Cat God completed a wonderful Z-shaped movement on the plank road!</p><br/><p>After seeing Cat God actively go in front of him, Zhu Qingyue returned to his senses and cautiously followed behind Li Cangyu.</p><br/><p>The World Competition was different from the Chinese league. The Spanish players were top-notch in strength. They played actively despite the strange map. Zhu Qingyu couldn\u2019t drag Cat God down!</p><br/><p>Zhu Qingyue took a deep breath to calm himself. Then he stared at the other side\u2019s position and quickly pressed keys on the keyboard.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

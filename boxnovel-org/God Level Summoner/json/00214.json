Before he could talk to the players, Zhang Shaohui hugged him and smiled to comfort him. \u201cBrother, you played really well. It doesn\u2019t matter. We\u2019ll come back next year.\u201d</p><br/><p>The smile on his face was bright and clear, without any pretenses. Lou Wushuang was in a bad mood but at this smile, his emotions quickly calm down. He patted his brother on the shoulder and said, \u201cYes, we\u2019ll work harder next year.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui was an optimist. Regardless of winning or losing, he could accept it quickly. He still had a bright smile on his face despite not being able to continue in the playoffs. In fact, Lou Wushuang had a cold personality so the Ghost Spirits team wouldn\u2019t be so harmonious without Vice-Captain Zhang\u2019s active atmosphere.</p><br/><p>In the past few years, Lou Wushuang\u2019s desire to win was very light. He was happy as long as he had this stupid bother playing the game with him. It was just that he was really depressed today. He didn\u2019t think the large stage would actually by the snail Li Xiaojiang\u2026</p><br/><p>He could only say that Li Cangyu\u2019s arrangements were really wonderful. Lou Wushuang was convinced.</p><br/><p>Soon, the members of Canglan were led by Li Cangyu to the Ghost Spirits team. Lou Wushuang stood up and shook hands with Li Cangyu. \u201cCongratulations to Cat God.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled and nodded. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t familiar with each other and the handshake was just a courtesy. Then the players from both teams came to the big stage and thanked the audience.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu saw all members of Wind Colour sitting in the VIP stands. The eight people dressed in black-red uniforms were really eye-catching. The handsome and cold-looking man in the middle was the captain of Wind Colour, Ling Xuefeng.</p><br/><p>Canglan had successfully advanced. Then in the finals of the seventh season, Wind Colour would become the last opponent!</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled towards Ling Xuefeng. The other side also smiled and gave up a thumbs up.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>In the post-match interview, the Ghost Spirits team lost and attended it first. The reporters were satisfied with Ghost Spirits\u2019 performance today. Unfortunately, the unexpected defeat in the first game made it very hard for Ghost Spirits in the later stages\u2026</p><br/><p>In response to this, some reporters questioned, \u201cGhost Spirits almost created the myth of being unbeaten at home during the regular season. Why did you unexpectedly lose to Canglan today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang quietly replied, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect Canglan to send Zhuo Hang in the team battle since he rarely appeared in the regular season. A hunter\u2019s restrictions on the assassins were too great. Our assassination flow tactics couldn\u2019t be played at all. Moreover, the hunter Zhuo Hang grew very quickly, which we didn\u2019t expect.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen Captain Lou, do you think Zhuo Hang has a chance of being the best newcomer in the seventh season?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang nodded. \u201cZhuo Hang isn\u2019t much worse than Chen Anran who won the rookie award last season. I think he should be shortlisted for this year\u2019s award.\u201d</p><br/><p>This sentence made Gu Siming, who was watching the interview, jump up and run to Zhuo Hang. \u201cHey hey, did you hear? Lou Wushuang says you have a chance of winning a newcomer award!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang pretended to dig out his ears and said, \u201cI hear you.\u201d He played cool on the surface but the smile couldn\u2019t hide the joy in his inner heart.</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang also smiled happily. \u201cIf you can, can get the new, newcomer award\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang reached out and touched his head. \u201cIf this is true then I will give you half the award, good?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang was shocked. \u201cEh? Why do you want to split it in half with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang smiled. \u201cYou are my partner. It isn\u2019t right if I don\u2019t split it in half with you!\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact, Zhuo Hang wanted to say more, \u2018It is because you let me grow up.\u2019</p><br/><p>In fact, Zhuo Hang always understood Cat God\u2019s purpose in placing him with Li Xiaojiang. His personality was too proud and his hand speed didn\u2019t contain any calm. This was precisely Li Xiaojiang\u2019s advantage.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu picked someone who was the exact opposite of Li Xiaojiang and combined them together. The Zhuo Li combination wasn\u2019t that strong but the two teenagers influenced each other. Zhuo Hang calmed down and could quietly handle situations while Li Xiaojiang gained more confidence and improved his movements.</p><br/><p>Finally, Li Cangyu\u2019s goal had been achieved. Under the influence of the complete opposites, Zhuo Hang\u2019s awareness improved by leaps and bounds while Li Xiaojiang became more cheerful. They were slowly improving and growing up but they didn\u2019t realize it.</p><br/><p>Today\u2019s match let Zhuo Hang realize how much progress he had made. The strange thing was that he made so much progress but didn\u2019t feel arrogant. He knew this was just the beginning and he still had a long way to go.</p><br/><p>Looking back on himself in the beginning, he thought the arrogant and conceited teenager was very ridiculous. That Zhuo Hang was a frog in a well, not knowing how broad the outside world was.</p><br/><p>Now he jumped out of that narrow world and knew his weaknesses. He would no longer think he was better than everyone else. He started to appreciate his teammates and respect his opponents. Even if Zhuo Hang won the newcomer award this season, the gap with the great gods was still huge. He needed to work tirelessly to keep up with the speed of the Miracle League!</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang thought this and felt that his eyes were suddenly open. He sincerely thanked Li Cangyu. If Li Cangyu hadn\u2019t seen his defects and adopted a targeted training method then perhaps he would just be a mediocre, invisible player, not the key hunter in the playoffs who shone against Ghost Spirits at home!</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu seemed to notice the teenager\u2019s gaze and turned to smile at Zhuo Hang. \u201cAre you very happy to be praised by Captain Lou?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang slightly blushed and replied, \u201cIt is good to be taught by Captain.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu patted him on the shoulder and whispered, \u201cIn fact, you have a good understanding and your hand speed isn\u2019t bad. However, you need to keep working to catch up with your relatives.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang nodded. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo and Tan Shitian, Zhuo Hang hadn\u2019t experienced how strong these two people were but this season\u2019s many encounters let him know that the great gods weren\u2019t weak. He surely had a gap with them and must continue to work hard. Otherwise, he would be thrown into the Pacific Ocean if the reporters discovered his identity!</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Ghost Spirits\u2019 post-match interview was quite harmonious. After all, there were few reporters who could withstand Lou Wushuang\u2019s cold atmosphere. None of them asked too sharp questions while the vice-captain enthusiastically replied. The reporters asked questions like \u2018their plans for the next season\u2019 and then ended it quietly.</p><br/><p>Once it was Canglan\u2019s turn, Li Cangyu took Bai Xuan with him and won warm applause from the reporters.</p><br/><p>One reporter immediately stood up and asked, \u201cCat God, why didn\u2019t you bring the other players with you today?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe newcomers aren\u2019t used to answering questions and they are excited about entering the finals. They are afraid that they will say the wrong thing because of nerves.\u201d Li Cangyu explained with a smile. In fact, he didn\u2019t want the newcomers to be disturbed by the outside world at this time. They didn\u2019t need to listen to people praising them. Relaxing was the most important thing before the finals.</p><br/><p>It was also common for him to attend the interviews with the vice-captain. The reporters stopped focusing on this matter and changed the topic. \u201cCat God has been playing Miracle for many years and this is the first time you\u2019ve made it into the finals of the playoffs. What is your biggest feeling at the moment?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu thought about it before seriously replying, \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve finally seen the light.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters heard this answer and felt very sad. This man really had a hard time for many years. Two teams had disbanded and he could only now reach the finals. He was simply an inspirational player who got back up after repeated defeats!</p><br/><p>A female reporter stood up, her voice a bit choked. \u201cCat God, Vice-Captain Bai, you might not remember me but I interviewed you in the year that the Miracle League was established. I am particularly moved to see you come back. Congratulations on making it to the finals. You must refuel!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan smiled. \u201cIt is hard to get to the finals. We will definitely do so.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think of Wind Colour as your opponent in the final? Cat God, are you confident about winning?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu said, \u201cWind Colour\u2019s strength is very high. As for the finals, I can\u2019t guarantee that I will win. To be honest, Canglan will do our best to win the championship. As for winning or losing, it depends on our performance and luck.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was truly an honest person. If Li Cangyu said that \u2018I am confident about winning against Wind Colour,\u2019 it would seem like he was bragging. His honest answer gave the reporters a good impression of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI still have a question to ask Cat God. Today you sent Zhuo Hang to the team battle and paired up with Xiaojiang. These are lineups that didn\u2019t appear in the regular season. Did Cat God arrange this to surprise everyone?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu answered, \u201cIt isn\u2019t to deliberately create a surprise. I just made lineup adjustments when facing Ghost Spirits. I will certainly do more adjustments against Wind Colour in the finals.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat type of adjustments will it be?\u201d Someone asked curiously.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu joked, \u201cYou will know at the time. I certainly can\u2019t reveal it before the match.\u201d</p><br/><p>A reporter made a teasing remark. \u201cIn today\u2019s game, Kou Hongyi said that 99% of people can\u2019t guess Cat God\u2019s thoughts and the remaining 1% is called Ling Xuefeng. We also found that Ling Xuefeng often guesses your tactical layout. Are you nervous about meeting someone who knows you so well in the finals?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu gave a refreshing smile. \u201cLing Xuefeng often guesses my layout but that is against other teams. Every time we face Wind Colour, he will become part of the 99% and his guessing isn\u2019t stable.\u201d</p><br/><p>He unceremoniously blackened Ling Xuefeng and the reporters were amused. They felt that Cat God and Captain Ling truly had a good relationship, or who would dare joke about Captain Ling like this? Don\u2019t look at Wind Colour!</p><br/><p>In response, some people privately interviewed Ling Xuefeng. \u201cCat God said that your guessing level isn\u2019t stable. You will guess wrong every time you encounter Canglan. What does Captain Ling think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng calmly responded, \u201cIf I guess wrong then he will also guess wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Then they were really fated enemies? Then what was this strange feeling?</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>After the interview, Li Cangyu and Bai Xuan returned to the backstage lounge. In the corridor, they encountered Ling Xuefeng. He seemed to be waiting here for a long time. He saw Li Cangyu and quickly approached.</p><br/><p>The very smart Bai Xuan left with the excuse of going to the bathroom and the two people were alone in the corridor.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu couldn\u2019t help smiling at the deep gaze. \u201cWere you waiting for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng nodded and stretched out his arms, firmly hugging the other person. \u201cCongratulations.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu hugged him back. There was a moment of silence before he whispered, \u201cXuefeng, I won\u2019t show you mercy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng smiled. \u201cI won\u2019t either.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them looked at each other in the empty corridor, seeing their image in the other person\u2019s eyes. At this moment, time seemed to stand still. The moment they met to the past seven years quickly slid through their minds, every scene exceptionally clear.</p><br/><p>At a young age, Ling Xuefeng came to invite him to join Wind Colour. Li Cangyu reluctantly said he was making his own team\u2026 the FTD team wasn\u2019t good enough and disbanded. Ling Xuefeng personally went to the US to discourage Li Cangyu from leaving but could only watch the person walk away. After Canglan was disbanded, Li Cangyu returned with his team. He met Ling Xuefeng in the online game and was told: [I have been waiting for you to come back. This is your home.]</p><br/><p>Over the years, there was one person who had been waiting for him. This person might be his opponent but it felt very warm.</p><br/><p>In the past, the 17 year old Li Cangyu smiled and said to the 18 year old Ling Xuefeng, \u201cIt seems that we can\u2019t be teammates.\u201d Ling Xuefeng firmly replied, \u201cThen I hope you will become my strongest opponent.\u201d</p><br/><p>Many things happened over the years and time flowed. Many players left the Miracle League and these two innocent teenagers became revered predecessors that countless people admired.</p><br/><p>However, the promise made at a young age was always remembered.</p><br/><p>Finally, Li Cangyu took the new Canglan team and reached the finals with much difficulty.</p><br/><p>Finally, Ling Xuefeng was in the finals, waiting for his king to return!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

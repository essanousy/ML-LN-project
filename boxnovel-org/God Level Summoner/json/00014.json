What is the original of this swordsman? He cuts us like he is chopping vegetables?\u201d</p><br/><p>The guild\u2019s healing sister, Flying Feather Frost replied calmly, \u201cThe strongest swordsmen in the old districts are all in our guild. The new district isn\u2019t very clear so this swordsman is probably a passersby with no guild. The opposite side\u2019s elf summoner is also very strong. I was under his control the whole time and couldn\u2019t read out a healing array.\u201d</p><br/><p>Flying Feather Frost continued, \u201cI think these three people are a bit strange. Should we report this to the president?\u201d</p><br/><p>Flying Feather Ares was silent for a moment before replying, \u201cYes, I will go find him first. You look at the situation from behind.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>On the Time Guild\u2019s side, an undercover suddenly sent a message: [President, a six member team of Flying Feathers has just been destroyed!]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Time Machine suddenly started sweating and he felt it was very smart for him to take the initiative to give up on the mission!</p><br/><p>First the Wind Colour\u2019s elite team was killed and then the Flying Feathers elite team. Love to Eat Braised Fish, Love to Eat Twice-cooked Pork and Blossoming Tree\u2026 these three people weren\u2019t simply ordinary masters.</p><br/><p>The majority of players in the team guilds were fans of the e-sports gods. For example, the Flying Feathers team was a swordsmen-based melee team. Many players who liked to play swordsman would join the Flying Feathers Guild, causing the swordsmen of the Flying Feathers Guild to be most powerful.</p><br/><p>Similarly, the Wind Colour Guild had the strongest black magicians and demon summoners, while the Time Guild had the strongest elf archers.</p><br/><p>The guilds had played with each other for a long time and they were very clear about each other\u2019s strength. The masters of the Wind Colour and Flying Feathers Guild weren\u2019t bad. Now two consecutive elite teams were eliminated and Time Machine couldn\u2019t help feeling shocked.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiaoluo, what do you know about this Braised Fish?\u201d Time Machine asked on the voice channel.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not that familiar with him. We met when leveling up in the Moonlight Forest.\u201d Xiaoluo paused before continuing. \u201cHe soloed a tree spirit three levels higher than him and was very relaxed doing so. By the way, he seems to be a fan of our vice-captain.\u201d</p><br/><p>Time Machine was surprised. \u201cHe is really a fan of our vice-captain?\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Xiaoluo nodded. \u201cYes! I invited him to join the Time Guild and he said he didn\u2019 t know our captain, Tan Shitian but he knew that our vice-captain is Cheng Wei. I guess that he should be a fan of Vice-Captain Cheng!\u201d</p><br/><p>Time Machine was happy. \u201cGreat! I have the signature of the vice-captain so use this hook to let him join our guild!\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Xiaoluo couldn\u2019t help feeling envious. \u201cI don\u2019t have our vice-captain\u2019s signature\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Time Machine said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I will help you get a signature the next time I see the vice captain and have him write: To Luo Xiaoluo, I wish you will never die. Is that enough?\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Xiaoluo cried out, \u201cIt is too much!\u201d</p><br/><p>Time Machine went on to say, \u201cWe have very few summoners in our guild. If you can pull him in, you will certainly have a big role in the late-stage instances. Your face is thick-skinned so I will hand this matter over to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Xiaoluo had long been excited after finding out that he could get Cheng Wei\u2019s signature. \u201cGood! Leave it to me!\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying this, he realized something and asked, \u201cWhy are you calling me thick-skinned?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCough.\u201d Time Machine pretended not to hear anything.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>After the elite team of Flying Feathers was destroyed, there wasn\u2019t a team that intercepted the bounty for a long time. Despite the NPC\u2019s name signaling triple rewards, no one from the guilds dared move against him.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan wondered, \u201cWhy is no one coming?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled and explained, \u201cThey might be speculating about our origins and might ot be able to easily move.\u201d</p><br/><p>He guessed right. The Time Colour and Flying Feathers had sent elite teams of six and were actually killed. This was quickly sent to the private chat of the presidents of the major guilds. Several presidents expressed their surprise.</p><br/><p>The elite teams of the other guilds were smart enough not to intercept the bounty mission of Love to Eat Braised Fish, so as to not be killed and thrown away.</p><br/><p>The big guilds didn\u2019t move but that didn\u2019t mean the random players would let it go.</p><br/><p>In the new district, there were many players who hadn\u2019t joined the guild. They saw that the NPC that Love to Eat Braised Fish\u2019s team was escorting had such high rewards and tried to intercept it.</p><br/><p>The result was\u2026</p><br/><p>Three consecutive teams of random players were eliminated.</p><br/><p>[This mission reward has accumulated 8,800 gold coins and 88,000 experience.]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu looked at the rewards on top of the NPC\u2019s head and smiled with satisfaction. \u201cThe harvest isn\u2019t bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan was very speechless because of this person!</p><br/><p>Deliberately forming a team of three to do the bounty mission in order to make everyone mistakenly think that it was easier to kill three people and attract other teams to rob them. They consecutively destroyed three teams, resulting in the rewards increasing\u2026</p><br/><p>The rewards were too terrible! It was comparable to fighting the boss of an instance 10 times in a row, not to mention the gold coins\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong also sent thumbs up to the team channel: [Cat God\u2019s thinking is really good. After this mission finishes, it will be no problem directly gaining two levels.]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu said: [I used to do bounty missions when playing the game. It is must faster to level up than doing instances.]</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan couldn\u2019t help saying: [You were originally this bad when you were young?]</p><br/><p>[This isn\u2019t being bad. It is a rational use of the game\u2019s system.] Li Cangyu spoke with a straight face. [I didn\u2019t force them to intercept the NPC. They came to the door themselves.]</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Well, it made sense!</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>There was 10 metres left until the escort mission ended. They thought there would be no more teams waiting to intercept. As a result, the three people arrived near the end and actually found a team waiting!</p><br/><p>\u2014Popular Land Under Heaven, Same Boat Under Wind and Rain, Wind Leaves no Traces, Wind and Clouds are Light, Wind Raises Leaves and Wind has Unmatched Style.</p><br/><p>The six people\u2019s IDs were neat and all had the Chinese character for \u2018wind\u2019 in their names.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu might not know these people but their titles clearly told him that this was the management team of the Wind Colour Guild.</p><br/><p>Popular Land Under Heaven had \u2018President of the Wind Colour Guild\u2019 above his head, while Wind Leaves no Traces, Same Boat Under Wind and Rain and Wind and Clouds are Light had \u2018vice president\u2019 above their heads. The other two were estimated to also be elites.</p><br/><p>It was difficult not to see them as the management of the guild since the words containing \u2018wind\u2019 must be running out.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled and typed in the area channel: [President was waiting for us?]</p><br/><p>Popular Land Under Heaven: Yes, take the bounty.]</p><br/><p>The president was decisive and straight-forward, aiming straight for the bounty!</p><br/><p>The team led by the vice president were wiped out by Li Cangyu. Popular Land Under Heaven had heard from the vice president that there was an elf summoner, terran swordsman and angel priest. It was really unbelievable that the three people could really wipe out the six member Wind Colour team.</p><br/><p>Thus, he decided to take a team to check for himself.</p><br/><p>This time he summoned the six strongest players in the Wind Colour guild.</p><br/><p>A demon summoner, blood kin summoner, two black magicians, a berserker and a blood kin sacrifice.</p><br/><p>This was modeled after the Wind Colour team.</p><br/><p>The most popular lineup in the Wind Colour team was the double summoners\u2019 control, the double black magicians\u2019 spell casting, the violent front row actions of the berserker and the healing of the blood kin sacrifice. Such a team\u2019s attack power was very terrible, especially when Wind Colour\u2019s captain Ling Xuefeng was the strongest demon summoner in the league. As long as the opponents were killed by him, the other players in Wind Colour could follow up with damage and the rhythm was basically controlled.</p><br/><p>Wind Colour would often play this team in war situations and it was due to the strength of the double summoners.</p><br/><p>The Wind Colour Guild had actually come up with such a luxurious lineup. It was obviously only after the team was destroyed but their opponent was Li Cangyu!</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan couldn\u2019t help feeling sympathy for this group of people who didn\u2019t know how to live.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu typed in the team channel: [The management of the Wind Colour Guild came?]</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong replied: [So much rewards have accumulated. Are you willing to give up?]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu didn\u2019t hesitate: [I don\u2019t want to.]</p><br/><p>[Then kill them!] Xie Shurong replied simple. [It doesn\u2019t matter if several guild managers came. Ling Xuefeng didn\u2019t personally come so why should I be afraid?]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was very calm. [I wouldn\u2019t be afraid even if Ling Xuefeng came.]</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong: [\u2026]</p><br/><p>Cat God\u2019s self-confidence really burst out!</p><br/><p>In the case of Ling Xuefeng personally leading the team, the three of them could only be destroyed. Three against six was still possible in the online game. But wanting to fight three against six professional players of the Wind Colour team was simply a fantasy.</p><br/><p>This hypothesis wasn\u2019t fun.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong smiled and typed in the team channel: [It seems that we have to completely offend the guild!]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu said seriously, [If they intercept the bounty mission, they should be prepared for failure. Their group was destroyed and the president personally led a team to destroy us. This can\u2019t be blamed on me.]</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Cat God made sense every time he spoke!</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>In the bounty mission instance, the battle list showed 6:3.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst kill the opposite summoner.\u201d Popular Land Under Heaven commanded calmly. \u201cThe berserker will control the opposite healer while the remaining four outputs will quickly take care of the summoner!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu ordered: [A\u2019shu, kill the opposite summoners\u2019 pets first.]</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan typed decisively: [I don\u2019t need you. I\u2019m not used to being protected by you and I feel like I will be killed as soon as you come close.]</p><br/><p>[\u2026] Xie Shurong remembered the scene of him chasing Vice-Captain Bai and couldn\u2019t help touching his nose while smiling. He raised his sword and fiercely cut the opponent protecting the healer. Since the vice-captain didn\u2019t like his presence, he would take the initiative to quickly attack and destroy the enemies.</p><br/><p>The Wind Colour\u2019s berserker rushed over to try and interfere with Bai Xuan. He didn\u2019t know that Bai Xuan was a god level healer and his survival ability was divine. When he had been besieged by four swordsmen of the Flying Feathers Guild, he was able to quickly move while restoring his blood. Now there was only one berserker close to him.</p><br/><p>The berserker chased after the healer and found that this healer was really flexible. He was still full of blood after a long chase!</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Xie Shurong had used two rushing skills to directly kill the other summoners. The demon summoner and blood kin summoner had just called their pets. Before they could use skills, Xie Shurong dealt consecutive strikes and killed the pets in seconds.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu himself was a summoner and he was very clear about how to deal with summoners\u2014either control the owner or simply kill the pets. There was no need to be afraid of a summoner without pets.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong\u2019s techniques were very fast. He didn\u2019t need to use skills, just his fast basic attacks were enough to make people frightened.</p><br/><p>The summoned pets weren\u2019t able to use their skills before they were killed. The summoners immediately changed their pets only for those ones to be killed by Xie Shurong.</p><br/><p>Could they still play like this?</p><br/><p>The most annoying thing to ranged classes was being disturbed by melee classes. Popular Land Under Heaven immediately said, \u201cBoat, you quickly control this swordsman!]</p><br/><p>The called Same Boat Under Wind and Rain was very depressed.</p><br/><p>He had just summoned a pet to control the other person when a big fireball came and killed his pet.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am going!\u201d Same Boat Under Wind and Rain couldn\u2019t help swearing. \u201cIs this Love to Eat Braised Fish using a special software to cheat?\u201d</p><br/><p>The other party\u2019s fireball arrived at almost the moment he summoned the pet, as if his thoughts had been read by the other person and his IQ was completely crushed. This feeling was really creepy!</p><hr/><hr/><br/>\n</div>"}

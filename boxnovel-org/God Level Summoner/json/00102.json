Everyone went to the restaurant near the club where a large private room with three tables was booked. It was a meal to welcome Cat God.</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan had heard about Li Cangyu\u2019s love of eating fish. He deliberately ordered the famous boiled fish and chopped pepper fish head from the restaurant. Li Cangyu looked at the menu and was really satisfied.</p><br/><p>The food hadn\u2019t arrived yet when Wu Zewen, captain of the Wulin team, and Li Xiang, the vice-captain, came over to the table to say hello.</p><br/><p>Wu Zewen wore silver-rimmed glasses and his expression was very calm. He was the person who helped Liu Chuan at the beginning of the club\u2019s creation. Once Liu Chuan retired to be the boss, he became captain. In a few years, Wu Zewen took the Dragon Warriors Club to repeated success. His ability to organize information and to analyze maps was extremely strong. He was a rare talented player.</p><br/><p>Vice-Captain Li Xiang was enthusiastic and hearty. He was Liu Chuan\u2019s apprentice in Wulin and used to be a stupid novice. He became one of the best players in the league under Liu Chuan\u2019s personal training. Then he took over as vice-captain and matured a lot.</p><br/><p>Wu Zewen wasn\u2019t good with alcohol so he was responsible for pouring the wine. Li Xiang raised a glass to Li Cangyu and declared, \u201cCat God, I didn\u2019t expect that you would one day join Dragon Warriors. I would like to represent the full Dragon Warriors team by raising a cup to you. First of all, welcome to the Dragon Warriors Club! If you encounter any problems in the future, tell us. We are family so don\u2019t hesitate!\u201d</p><br/><p>He said it with great pride.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled at him and touched their glasses together before drinking. \u201cPlease take care of me in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCat God is too polite!\u201d Li Xiang followed up by going to Bai Xuan. \u201cMilk God, long time no see. Come have a drink!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan stood up with a smile. \u201cI can\u2019t drink. I have been taking Chinese medicine lately so I will just have tea.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiang wondered, \u201cDo you have stomach problems?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Bai Xuan replied helplessly. \u201cIt is an old problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiang immediately made a fuss. \u201cYou have to take care of that. Pay attention to your diet and sleep. I used to have stomach problems caused by irregular working hours and drinking iced drinks. Later, I took stomach medicine and now I\u2019m completely fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he was speaking, the door was suddenly pushed open and a cold voice was heard. \u201cEveryone is here? Sorry, I went to the airport to pick up Si Lan and there was a traffic jam.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiang immediately turned around and greeted the person. \u201cYeye came!\u201d</p><br/><p>The group turned to look and saw two men come in one after the other.</p><br/><p>The man that Li Xiang called \u2018Yeye\u2019 was very cold. He wore tight black pants and a slim jacket that showed off his slender figure. His short hair fell over his face and there seemed to be an innate pride on his face. Add the shiny shoes on his feet and the whole person gave off a delicate feeling.</p><br/><p>The other man had a languid demeanor. His hands were in his pockets as he yawned while walking casually. He had slightly longer chestnut hair and had a strange temperament similar to an \u2018artist.\u2019</p><br/><p>Once the two men arrived, all members of the Dragon Warriors Wulin team stood up very respectfully.</p><br/><p>Xiao Han, Li Xiaojiang and the others didn\u2019t know who these men were but they had to stand up with blank expressions.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeye, Si Lan, you came?\u201d Li Cangyu walked up to them with a smile and shook their hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cLiu Chuan told us to come back because something big happened. I guessed it was the formation of the Miracle branch.\u201d Qin Ye looked over at Bai Xuan and the new faces on the table and asked, \u201cCat God, is this the team that you built?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu nodded. \u201cYes, today is the first day the full team is gathered.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Ye gave a rare smile as he said, \u201cYour progress is quite fast. You found teammates in only half a year.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan laughed as he walked over. \u201cOur club has taken a new step and our power has grown. How can two old veterans not give face by not coming to the celebration. Right, Si Lan?\u201d</p><br/><p>The yawning man turned around and narrowed his eyes. \u201cYes, Boss Liu is right about everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan smiled and turned to the new people on the Miracle side. \u201cThis is Qin Ye, he is the Dragon Warriors Club\u2019s ace coach. This is Lan Weiran, abbreviated to Si Lan. He is the first vice-captain of the Dragon Warriors team.\u201d</p><br/><p>The newcomers were very surprised.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t expect that Liu Chuan would invite such veterans to welcome the new team.</p><br/><p>Coach Qin Ye was famous in the e-sports circle. It was said that he was very strict with the players, especially newcomers. If they weren\u2019t obedient, they would be scolded by him. When Xiao Gu saw Qin Ye, he tried to hide under the table. He had obviously been scolded by Qin Ye.</p><br/><p>Lan Weiran was the vice-captain of the Dragon Warriors team and the legendary strategist. After retiring, he disappeared for many years. Even many newcomers in the Dragon Warriors Club had never seen him. Liu Chuan inviting him today showed that the reformation of the Canglan team was very important.</p><br/><p>The scene became very lively once two great gods arrived.</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan, Qin Ye and Si Lan took the initiative to sit at Li Cangyu\u2019s table. Liu Chuan gave a brief explanation of the situation of the new team. Si Lan looked at these teenagers and his eyes narrowed. \u201cThe four youngsters are very good but Cat God will need to work hard. The newcomers need time to grow slowly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu agreed, \u201cFortunately, before the start of the first division, there is the second division that will be a transitional event. It will train them well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how our team was like in the past. At first, the new people were in a precarious state and they gradually matured.\u201d Qin Ye\u2019s eyes swept over the four team and he asked calmly, \u201cYou seem to be confident in your team this time?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu nodded firmly. \u201cYes, I\u2019m sure I will win the prize.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lan Weiran spoke emotionally, \u201cIn fact, we have the same experience. In the past, I never won any trophies and only joined the Dragon Warriors team to prove myself. I believe that your luck will be as good as mine and you will become the champion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled. \u201cI think so as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan suddenly interjected, \u201cCat God could tie with me in that year. He is obviously very powerful and will take the championship.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Ye looked at him. \u201cAre you praising Cat God or yourself?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan laughed. \u201cWe are equally powerful! There is a magnetic field of empathy between masters. Cat God and I are masters standing at the top of the professional leagues and can happily cooperate, isn\u2019t that right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The boss started to boast and everyone immediately ducked their heads.</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang felt that he was too lacking compared to Boss Liu\u2019s boasting power! He needed to continue learning.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The atmosphere of this meal was very joyful, especially Li Cangyu, Qin Ye and Si Lan. These players haven\u2019t seen each other for a long time and couldn\u2019t stop once they started chatting about the past.</p><br/><p>Xiao Han and Xiao Li weren\u2019t familiar with several seniors but thanks to Xiao Gu\u2019s explanations, they learned about some past events. Liu Chuan, Qin Ye and Lan Weiran were the beginning of the Dragon Warriors Club\u2019s establishment. The three pillars used to the heroes of the professional league. They were retired ow but they had the same style. The invincible appearance of them on the field could still be seen.</p><br/><p>Everyone felt excited when they heard Cat God chatting with these gods, as if the championship trophy was waving to everyone.</p><br/><p>After dinner ended, Wu Zewen took the initiative to pay for it with his team\u2019s funds. Liu Chuan took Li Cangyu back to the team dormitory and arranged two quadruple rooms for them. The two apartments were on the same floor and facing each other, making later discussions convenient.</p><br/><p>Once this was settled, Liu Chuan patted Li Cangyu\u2019s shoulder and sighed. \u201cThe newcomers might be strong but you have to bring so many newcomers with you to the competition. It will be very hard on you as the captain\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He had also been a team leader and knew how difficult it was to raise newcomers. Thus, he was very impressed with Li Cangyu\u2019s decision to find so many newcomers.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu declared confidently, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I believe they won\u2019t let me down. These four talents aren\u2019t bad. I will slowly train them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan smiled and said, \u201cI am 100% reassured with you leading them. The four newcomers have just joined the team and might not be used to the daily life. You and Vice-Captain Bai should think about this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu nodded. \u201cYes, I\u2019ll talk to Xiao Bai.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan left and Li Cangyu started arranging the accommodations.</p><br/><p>He let Bai Xuan, Li Xiaojiang, Xie Shurong and Zhuo Hang live in one room while he lived with Uncle Zhang, Xiao Gu and Xiao Han.</p><br/><p>The Dragon Warriors had excellent accommodations and there were many double apartments. However, Li Cangyu felt that the team was just established and everyone wasn\u2019t familiar with each other. If the two roommates sharing the double room weren\u2019t suitable to be roommates, it was easy to have problems. A quadruple room was also more convenient to communicate with each other.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu lived with Xiao Han in order to personally raise his apprentice. Uncle Zhu had been helping familiarize Xiao Gu with other classes and could guide Gu Siming.</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang had an introverted personality and wasn\u2019t good at talking so Bai Xuan\u2019s gentle coaxing would help integrate him into the team more quickly. As for Zhuo Hang being paired with Xie Shurong, Li Cangyu thought that A\u2019Shu was the best at playing fast. Zhuo Hang had a very high hand speed so he could learn to maximize his strengths from A\u2019Shu.</p><br/><p>It was a simple dormitory arrangement but Li Cangyu considered it so carefully. An old player was paired with a new player. The one on one tutoring would allow the youngsters to adapt to the team\u2019s rhythm as quickly as possible.</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang naturally had no opinions on the arrangement of the dormitory. The unrestrained teenager soon became familiar with Xie Shurong and called Brother Tree very kind.</p><br/><p>It was Li Xiaojiang who was uneasy about living with so many strangers.</p><br/><p>He was silently unpacking when Bai Xuan suddenly knocked on the door of his bedroom. \u201cXiao Jiang, Cat God is decisive. He seems serious when it comes to business but he is actually very easy to get along with. Don\u2019t feel any psychological pressure. If you aren\u2019t used to eating the food or if you have any problems during training, you can secretly tell me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang was moved and nodded. \u201cYes, I know. Thank you Vice-Captain.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan gently touched the teenager\u2019s head. Among the four teenagers, he was most worried about Li Xiaojiang, who was thin and small. He stammered and clearly lacked confidence. It wasn\u2019t easy to raise this child\u2019s confidence but Bai Xuan believed that he could let Xiao Jiang gradually let down his guard.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Once all the team members settled in their dorms, Li Cangyu returned to his bedroom and stood by the window. He sent a text message to Ling Xuefeng: [The team is good. I have already arrived at the club and will officially start training tomorrow.]</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng quickly replied: [Congratulations. It is a new beginning. You have to refuel.]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu saw Ling Xuefeng\u2019s brief words of encouragement and was moved.</p><br/><p>At the age of 17, he refused Ling Xuefeng\u2019s invitation to serve as the vice-captain of Wind Colour and set up his own team. The first FTD team was established during a period of hot-blood and his teammates were all excited. Li Cangyu had been full of enthusiasm and expectations for the future. Unfortunately, he only met a basin of cold water for three years.</p><br/><p>FTD disbanded and he led the team to transfer games. At that time, he wasn\u2019t as simple and became more mature and stable. Once the Canglan team transferred to Wulin, they faced many accusations and doubts. Every time they lost a game, there would be a large number of netizens ridiculing them. However, he was able to withstand these criticisms because it was his own choice.</p><br/><p>It was the path he chose so he should finish it.</p><br/><p>Today, the new Canglan team was completely formed according to his own ideas. Half the members might be youngsters who had no experience with the professional league but they were talented. Li Cangyu had full confidence that he could go further with this team and realize the dream of standing on the stage.</p><br/><p>He looked out the window at the bustling night scenery and couldn\u2019t help smiling confidently.</p><br/><p>As Ling Xuefeng said, it was a new beginning and he had to refuel.</p><br/><p>So many years past and his third team was settled. The long-lost Miracle League, the old friends and old opponents, Old Cat Li Cangyu was finally coming home!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

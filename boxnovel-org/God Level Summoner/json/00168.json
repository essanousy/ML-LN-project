The economic gap between the two teams was more than 10,000 coins. In such a situation, it was difficult for any team in the league to make a comeback.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu\u2019s style of play was very stable and he kept this advantage until the end of the game. This game was successfully won by Canglan and the final score was determined to be 1:2.</p><br/><p>The match ended and the Red Fox players took the initiative to come and greet them. Liu Xiang behaved politely and Li Cangyu graciously shook hands with her, saying, \u201cCaptain Liu is very strong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiang smiled. \u201cCat God is also very strong. The third game was well arranged.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled. \u201cThanks for the praise!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy master is present and wants to ask you to have a meal. Can Cat God do us this favour?\u201d</p><br/><p>Her master was a friend Li Cangyu knew in his early years, Yu Bing. Yu Bing took the initiative to invite him so Li Cangyu promised to come. \u201cOkay, I will go out and eat with her later.\u201d Then he turned and said to Bai Xuan in a low voice, \u201cI won\u2019t go to dinner today. Let everyone move freely. It is their first time in Suzhou and they can explore the city.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan nodded. \u201cI understand. I\u2019ll arrange it.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>For this post-match interview, Li Cangyu only brought Li Xiaojiang with him.</p><br/><p>The reporters asked as soon as they saw him, \u201cCat God, why didn\u2019t you change the lineup when you lost the first two games?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cIt is because I had confidence in Li Xiaojiang.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang was very moved from where he sat next to Li Cangyu. Li Cangyu smiled at him in an encouraging manner and continued, \u201cThe four newcomers currently aren\u2019t mature enough. In particular, Li Xiaojiang lacks confidence in himself. I let him play in the third game today to tell him that no matter the circumstances, Canglan won\u2019t give up on him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang\u2019s eyes became wet at the captain\u2019s firm remarks.</p><br/><p>It was true that he would\u2019ve felt more uncomfortable if the captain replaced him after losing the first two games.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t tell anyone but he actually felt very inferior. In the Canglan team, he was the slowest one with the worst foundation. He was also the worst when it came to family.</p><br/><p>He was from a small country village and his parents were honest and loyal farmers. He couldn\u2019t compare to Xiao Han who lived in a foreign country, Zhuo Hang whose parents were rich and Gu Siming, who had lived in Changsha for many years. Once the four newcomers got together, they would naturally talk about the game as well as other topics.</p><br/><p>For example, when talking about hobbies, Zhuo Hang was very fond of snooker and loved watching the Snooker World Championship on his iPad. Gu Siming loved to watch anime like Naruto and One Piece. Xiao Han liked American dramas and could watch them without subtitles. However, Li Xiaojiang didn\u2019t understand any of their words.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know what snooker was, he had never seen Naruto and he hadn\u2019t heard of the Vampire Diaries.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t seem to live in the same world as his peers.</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang was usually silent when Cat God was absent. It was because he couldn\u2019t discuss things with the three teenagers.</p><br/><p>He always felt that he was an insignificant presence in the team. He was a dispensable invisible person. When necessary, Cat God would send him to cooperate with Zhuo Hang in the arena. At other times, he just sat on the bench and watched everyone\u2019s performance.</p><br/><p>Every team would have second-tier players who were substitutes so Li Xiaojiang didn\u2019t complain. He already thought he was lucky that he was discovered by Cat God and joined the Canglan team. He couldn\u2019t ask for too much.</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang had been very satisfied after killing one person in the last match. He thought that perhaps he could also kill solo on the field? He cooperated well with Zhuo Hang and completed Cat God\u2019s task.</p><br/><p>Today, Li Cangyu told him with practical actions that he wasn\u2019t a small and invisible player on the Canglan team. He was as important as other players!</p><br/><p>No matter the circumstances, Canglan wouldn\u2019t give up on him!</p><br/><p>Not only could he be Zhuo Hang\u2019s partner, he could also be the main attacker in the Canglan team and become the core output in a team battle, taking the achievement of super god in one breath!</p><br/><p>He, Li Xiaojiang, could do it!</p><br/><p>Becoming an unstoppable super god in the seventh season\u2019s first division was something he had never dreamt of before.</p><br/><p>He had watched the Miracle League for several years and admired and envied those who got the achievement of super god. Now Li Xiaojiang personally stood on the stage of the professional league and became a super god!</p><br/><p>At this moment, Li Xiaojiang felt that the door to a new world had opened in front of him. He wasn\u2019t as bad as he thought and could become stronger.</p><br/><p>This was why Li Cangyu told him with this game.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu\u2019s care for Li Xiaojiang moved the reporters at the venue.</p><br/><p>In particular, many female reporters were distressed after seeing the young boy\u2019s tearful eyes.</p><br/><p>This child was working very hard but his talent wasn\u2019t high and his personality was introverted. It seemed he still had some sense of inferiority. Li Cangyu was trying to strengthen his confidence and push him towards a higher throne.</p><br/><p>A female reporter stood up and asked in a gentle tone, \u201cXiaojiang, is there anything you would like to say about the captain\u2019s arrangement?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang picked up the microphone and choked out, \u201cThank you, thank you. The captain gave me this opportunity. I know that today, today I could win the achievement of super god thanks to everyone giving me, me the head. I am particularly touched. I never thought that one day I could get, get the super god. I will work hard in the future and not let my teammates down\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The little guy stammered with tears in his eyes and Li Cangyu led the applause.</p><br/><p>This was the longest Li Xiaojiang had spoken in front of reporters since becoming a professional player. It was very simple but sincere.</p><br/><p>Many reporters couldn\u2019t help following Cat God to clap.</p><br/><p>Compared to the talented players who had the aura of a genius since debut, the progress of ordinary and weak players like Li Xiaojiang made people more moved.</p><br/><p>A reporter couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cCat God, you seem particularly concerned about Xiaojiang. Aren\u2019t you afraid the other three newcomers will have an opinion on this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu replied honestly, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t believe that the players are that small-minded. Besides, my training for them hasn\u2019t officially started yet!\u201d</p><br/><p>The three newcomers watching the interview immediately pricked up their ears, their eyes full of expectations.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan saw this and couldn\u2019t help laughing. As the vice-captain, he was naturally very clear about the situation of the four players. Among the four newcomers, Li Xiaojiang had the weakest confidence and the worst foundation. It was correct for Li Cangyu to start with Li Xiaojiang first since weak people had a bigger room for improvement. It was harder for those who were already very good to make a breakthrough.</p><br/><p>It was like those who practiced martial arts in martial arts novels. It might take two or three years to get started with martial arts and then five to eight years to become a master. Those who became a master might take a lifetime to break through.</p><br/><p>Of the four newcomers, the one who was hardest to progress was Gu Siming. He had been training with the Dragon Song Club for a long time and his foundation was very solid. His impulsive problem had to do with his personality, which was even more difficult to correct. Therefore, Li Cangyu didn\u2019t rush to correct him despite his performance in the last few game being slightly lacking. Xiao Gu\u2019s change needed to be slow and subtle. It was impossible to change the style of a player in one or two matches.</p><br/><p>As for Zhuo Hang and Xiao Han, Bai Xuan knew Li Cangyu and their training would definitely be worse!</p><br/><p>Look at Xiao Han who was currently playing very comfortably with his master. Li Cangyu wasn\u2019t stingy when it came to praising him. However, if Xiao Han didn\u2019t improve then Cat God would certainly use cruel tricks to make this guy break through.</p><br/><p>Where was the cruel trick? It would probably happen against Wind Colour!</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan smiled as he thought this. The four newcomers were looking forward to being taught by Li Cangyu. This was obviously Cat God\u2019s personal charm that had already overwhelmed them.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan\u2019s eyes were on the screen but Xie Shurong\u2019s eyes were always on Bai Xuan.</p><br/><p>This smiling man\u2019s side profile was soft under the illumination of the light. The curve of his nose and lips was simply the creator\u2019s most perfect masterpiece. Xie Shurong almost went crazy seeing it.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>In the post-match interview, Li Cangyu not only explained the reasons for not changing the lineup but also evaluated the Red Fox players.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn my opinion, there isn\u2019t much difference between a female player and a male player. They are worthy of my respect as long as they are professionals who try to play the game. In today\u2019s match, the Red Fox team\u2019s performance was excellent. In particular, Red Fox Captain Liu Xiang\u2019s clear thinking and meticulous tactics were daunting.\u201d</p><br/><p>A reported wanted gossip. \u201cCat God, who do you think is the most beautiful player in Red Fox?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was slightly startled at being asked something that had nothing to do with the game but replied, \u201cI didn\u2019t pay attention.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Many viewers typed ellipsis. [Cat God, do you only stare at the screen?] [Strength hurts Old Cat. Not even looking at so many beautiful women. No wonder why you don\u2019t have a girlfriend!] [Old Cat, you will be an old dog~ an old single dog!]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu naturally ignored the comments and went backstage with Li Xiaojiang after finishing the interview.</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang suddenly stopped in the hallway and pulled gently at Li Cangyu\u2019s sleeve. \u201cC-Captain\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was puzzled. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang looked up at him and said earnestly, \u201cThank, thank you. I understand what you mean and will refuel.\u201d</p><br/><p>This guy wasn\u2019t very talkative but every word was sincere.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu knew the thanks was sincere and that through this match, Li Xiaojiang would have a clearer and more accurate understanding of his position in the Canglan team.</p><br/><p>A team always had top students and weaker students. In order to improve the overall level of the team, the best way was to pull up the weaker students first.</p><br/><p>Thankfully, Li Xiaojiang might have some inferiority but he wasn\u2019t a coward. He kept up with the whole team with the help of his teammates.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu believed that Xiaojiang\u2019s mentality would slowly chance and a mature and stable black magician would contribute more to the Canglan team.</p><br/><p>Only confident, decisive players were qualified to walk side by side with their teammates into the playoffs.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu looked at the boy with tears in his black eyes and couldn\u2019t help smiling slightly. He patted Xiaojiang on the shoulder and said softly, \u201cI can only help you this much. How high you can climb in the future depends on yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang nodded vigorously. \u201cYes, I understand!\u201d</p><br/><p>The ID he registered was Snail Crawling Slowly. His progress was indeed a bit slow but with Li Cangyu\u2019s help, he walked solidly every step of the way.</p><br/><p>It was like a student who always failed the exam finding out that he could get 80 points. Then why not aim for 90 or 100 points?</p><br/><p>He could only go further by setting a higher goal.</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang formed fists at Li Cangyu\u2019s gentle encouragement and gave himself a new task. Perhaps he didn\u2019t have Zhuo Hang and Xiao Han\u2019s talent or Gu Siming\u2019s solid foundation but he could make up for his own shortcomings with twice as much hard work.</p><br/><p>One day he would stand with his teammates and no longer need their deliberate care. He would use his own strength to become a real super god!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

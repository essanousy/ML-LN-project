Since the Ghost Spirits team was on holiday, the club only had one security guard left. Thus, the two directly returned home with their luggage.</p><br/><p>Both of Zhang Shaohui\u2019s parents died at a very young age and he was taken in by a distant cousin. He stayed in this home for more than 10 years and although his blood relationship with his cousin was very distant, he always treated has as his aunt in his heart.</p><br/><p>When the two people arrived home, Zhang Wen was cooking dinner in the kitchen. Zhang Shaohui smelt the delicious fragrance and curiously asked, \u201cA good smell. Auntie, what are you making that is so delicious?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mother Lou smiled. \u201cI am making your favourite braised pork ribs to five to the two of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang\u2019s personality was cold and he rarely communicated with his parents. On the other hand, Zhang Shaohui was enthusiastic and honest, especially with his elders. After a long time, Zhang Shaohui was like this family\u2019s own son.</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang entered the house and saw a man sitting on the sofa of the living room while reading a newspaper. He went over and greeted the man. \u201cFather.\u201d</p><br/><p>Instead of going to a university, Lou Wushuang ran to the e-sports world with his cousin. Lou Wushuang\u2019s father was so angry he almost got a heart attack but Lou Wushuang was stubborn and didn\u2019t listen to his parents\u2019 advice. His father had been worried and had little contact with his son in recent years. The relationship between father and son was very rigid.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t until the Ghost Spirits won the championship under Lou Wushuang\u2019s leadership that his father\u2019s thoughts gradually changed.</p><br/><p>This time, the Lou Zhang brothers represented the national team in the World Competition. Father Lou might not understand the game but he watched several live broadcasts with his wife. Every time he saw the brothers playing, he couldn\u2019t help feeling excited.</p><br/><p>Perhaps the older generation\u2019s thoughts were too old. He didn\u2019t understand the e-sports that young people played but since it received the approval of the state, it showed it wasn\u2019t a bad business. His son had strong opinions from a young age and he should accept it.</p><br/><p>Thinking of this, the man\u2019s expression softened a lot and he glanced at his son. \u201cPut away your luggage first and get ready to eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Lou Wushuang placed his luggage in the bedroom, washed and returned to the table. Zhang Shaohui was already helping Mother Lou set up a table full of delicacies.</p><br/><p>The family sat down to eat. Lou Wushuang\u2019s face was as cold as always as he ate. It was Zhang Shaohui who excitedly told the two elders many things about the World Competition, laughing as Mother Lou praised him.</p><br/><p>After dinner, Zhang Shaohui went to the kitchen to help cut a plate of fruit. Lou Wushuang headed to the living room and said, \u201cFather, I have something to discuss with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The son usually didn\u2019t speak a lot but once he spoke seriously, it showed there was something important to discuss.</p><br/><p>Father Lou took it seriously and asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang told him, \u201cI and Ah Hui have grown up and it isn\u2019t convenient to live at home. I want to buy a house and move out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui heard this and immediately came over while scratching his head. \u201cBrother, or I will move away\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t interrupt.\u201d Lou Wushuang scolded him and watched his father as he continued. \u201cOur family\u2019s home is too small. There are only two rooms and Ah Hui and I have been sharing a room. Two children can squeeze into a bed to sleep but now we are so big. The two of us can\u2019t sleep in one bed, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mother Lou agreed. \u201cYou are right, I also think this house is too much. They are both over 20 years old and it will be difficult to live with elders when they get married.\u201d She cut the apples as she spoke. \u201cLet\u2019s say that Ah Hui wants to find a girlfriend. Who will be willing to speak to him if they know he lives with his cousin\u2019s family?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui exclaimed, \u201cIt is still early. Brother should find one first\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang stared coldly at him and Zhang Shaohui immediately shut up. He sensed that his cousin seemed a bit angry but didn\u2019t know the reason. He had to sit next to his cousin and stay silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have been saving up and there is enough to buy a house. I want to buy a two bedroom place and will first move out with Ah Hui for a while. Then we will think about the future.\u201d Lou Wushuang\u2019s expression was very serious and there was no way to refute his reasons.</p><br/><p>Mother Lou expressed support. \u201cThis is good. Buying two sets at a time won\u2019t cost as much money. You can first buy a place to move out. In any case, the two of you are young and can slowly earn money before changing to a bigger house.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui glanced at Lou Wushuang and asked tentatively, \u201cI also have some savings. Brother\u2026 should we buy it together?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang wasn\u2019t angry this time and nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Three people in the family agreed and Father Lou had nothing to object to. He could only say, \u201cIt isn\u2019t a trivial matter to buy a house. Take a few real estate agents to take a look and compare before making a decision.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRest assured, I\u2019ll consider it carefully.\u201d Lou Wushuang turned to Zhang Shaohui. \u201cTomorrow, go and look at houses with me. It is best to buy a place during this holiday.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I know!\u201d Zhang Shaohui nodded and promised.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>After taking a shower, the parents went to sleep first and Lou Wushuang and Zhang Shaohui took successively took a bath. Zhang Shaohui found that it was really inconvenient for everyone to live together, especially when it came to bathing at night. It felt uncomfortable lining up with elders for the shower. At least in the Ghost Spirits team, he shared a double dormitory with Lou Wushuang.</p><br/><p>They had lived together in this bedroom for more than 10 years. It didn\u2019t feel crowded when they were young, only warm. Now the two 20 year old men really would be uncomfortable when crammed into one bed.</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui saw his brother sitting on the edge of the bed and suggested, \u201cBrother, I will take the floor tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is just a few days, Squeezing in is nothing.\u201d Lou Wushuang pointed to the spot next to him. \u201cCome over, I have something to say to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui immediately walked over and sat down. \u201cBrother, tell me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe reason I want to move out isn\u2019t to abandon you. Don\u2019t misunderstand.\u201d Lou Wushuang pushed up his glasses and stared seriously. \u201cWe are grown up and it is inconvenient to live with my parents. If it is our own home, we can casually wear shorts in the summer. However, if there are elders then we must be scrupulous in all aspects, whether it is playing games or watching TV. I am also worried about arguing with them. Do you understand what I mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I understand!\u201d Zhang Shaohui smiled. \u201cI know that you wouldn\u2019t abandon me. You have been treating me as a younger brother since childhood. How could you do that?\u201d He wrapped an arm around Lou Wushuang\u2019s shoulder to express brotherly affection.</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang turned a blind eye to it while thinking, \u2018Who will treat you as a brother? The blood relationship between us is distant enough to be my great-grandfather\u2019s generation!\u2019</p><br/><p>The blood relationship was so distant yet Lou Wushuang\u2019s parents took in Zhang Shaohui to raise. In fact, it was because Lou Wushuang\u2019s personality was too cold and he never played with other children. His mother was worried her son would experience problems and took in Zhang Shaohui to give him a companion.</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui came home and Lou Wushuang\u2019s personality really improved a lot. At the very least, he would smile. Whenever the two children played together, Zhang Shaohui would toss the toys while Lou Wushuang watched from the side but it was better than Lou Wushuang being alone.</p><br/><p>After growing up together, Zhang Shaohui was like a small heater. He filled Lou Wushuang\u2019s childhood and teenage years with sunshine and happiness, making him long inseparable from this brother.</p><br/><p>It was just that this strong emotion that almost burned him had always been well hidden in his heart.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>That night, Zhang Shaohui stubbornly slept on the ground. he felt that his height of 1.8 metres and his strength would definitely squeeze his brother, making Lou Wushuang\u2019s sleep uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang felt helpless as he saw Zhang Shaohui lying on the floor while covered in a blanket. Lou Wushuang really wanted to bring him up but knew this type of thing couldn\u2019t be forced. Otherwise, it would be counterproductive.</p><br/><p>The next morning, they finished eating and Lou Wushuang brought Zhang Shaohui to a real estate agency to express his ideas and requirements.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019d like it to be quiet. It is better if the community isn\u2019t in the downtown area. The environment should be better. The size of the house doesn\u2019t need to be too large. Two rooms sufficient for two people to live are enough.\u201d Lou Wushuang spoke in a calm manner.</p><br/><p>The sister assisting them asked seriously, \u201cA place for two people to live, Mr. Lou, are you preparing a wedding house?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang replied lightly, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui scratched his head. His cousin was buying a house in advance for marriage? Then Zhang Shaohui would borrow it a while and once his brother got a girlfriend, he would move out. Zhang Shaohui thought this and felt relieved.</p><br/><p>The agent seemed to be saying something to him. Lou Wushuang was forced to turn around and asked, \u201cDo you like an elevator or a staircase?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui\u2019s senses returned and he was startled. \u201cEh?\u201d What about him? Wasn\u2019t Lou Woushang preparing a wedding house?</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang\u2019s face was cold. \u201cWould you like an elevator or staircase? Or do you want to buy a villa?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui laughed. \u201cThis\u2026 Brother, you decide.\u201d Then he went to Lou Wushuang and whispered, \u201cIsn\u2019t a villa expensive? I don\u2019t think it is necessary to buy a big wedding house. A small house is warm and good enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think so too.\u201d Lou Wushuang nodded. \u201cThen buy a place in a high-rise building. A good community with property management is better and the facilities should be perfect. I don\u2019t want to pay money every month for the loan. A lump sum\u2026 how about your money?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui immediately pulled out his bank card and handed it to Lou Wushuang. \u201cNo problem, here\u2019s all my money for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang accepted the card and a hint of a smile appeared on his cold face.</p><br/><p>There was a saying that accounts shouldn\u2019t be settled between brothers. However, once Lou Wushuang asked for money, Zhang Shaohui didn\u2019t hesitate to take out all his savings. This wasn\u2019t something that ordinary people could do.</p><br/><p>Did it mean the feelings between them had already surpassed ordinary brotherhood?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

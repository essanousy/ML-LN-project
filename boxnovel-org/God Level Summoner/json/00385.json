Xie Shurong\u2019s shamelessness refreshed his understanding of the word \u2018cheeky\u2019. Xie Shurong lay on bed and looked up at Bai Xuan in a wronged manner, like Bai Xuan was bullying him. Despite knowing this person was faking it and really wanting to leave, Bai Xuan couldn\u2019t bear it.</p><br/><p>He took a deep breath to calm his emotions. Finally, Bai Xuan coughed and tidied up his clothing. \u201cThat\u2026 perhaps take a cold shower? Or you can resolve it yourself? I have guests at home and need to be there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d Xie Shurong looked at Bai Xuan with pitiful eyes. \u201cI have been using a cold shower for almost a year and my right hand isn\u2019t good these days. I\u2019m your boyfriend and you should help my resolve my physical problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan was amused by him. \u201cXie Shurong, can you not be so shameless?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong got up and hugged Bai Xuan\u2019s waist. \u201cI was prompted and a formal worker has the right to make reasonable demands of the boss. We are already a couple and further intimacy is a reasonable request\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan smiled. \u201cThe boss refuses.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong placed his head on the other person\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI like you, want to kiss you and hug you. Let me try it once okay? I put up with it for almost a year. You should show compassion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan rubbed his head. \u201cYou were only promoted yesterday yet you\u2019re asking for a raise today. Don\u2019t you think the progress is too fast?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong stopped his actions with a deep look in his black eyes. \u201cDoes that mean you can promise in a few days?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan coughed. \u201cThat type of thing\u2026 it is better to go with the flow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong was silent for a moment before suddenly smiling and whispering in Bai Xuan\u2019s ear, \u201cAre you nervous? Is this your first time? You haven\u2019t done anything with anyone before?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan reddened and he slapped this person\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019m going home first. I have guests at home tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t use that excuse to lie to me.\u201d Xie Shurong\u2019s voice was wronged again. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t bear it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not lying to you. My uncle said that he would come see me tonight. I haven\u2019t seen him for several years and it isn\u2019t appropriate for me to be late.\u201d Bai Xuan was forced to kiss this person on the forehead.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, then go!\u201d Xie Shurong showed a bright smile after being kissed, his wronged expression swept away.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan really felt that this person was the best movie emperor in the Miracle circle. These rich facial expressions could be freely switched between!</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>After leaving the hotel, the cool night wind blew against Bai Xuan\u2019s face and heat gradually subsided. Bai Xuan felt a bit guilty about leaving Ah Shu like that but on one hand, his family actually had guests tonight. His parents knew he was going to dinner with Xie Shurong and their thoughts wouldn\u2019t be good if he didn\u2019t return.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Bai Xuan had just decided that he wanted to continue falling in love with Xie Shurong. It hadn\u2019t been one day and he wasn\u2019t mentally prepared for further intimacy.</p><br/><p>As Xie Shurong said, this was indeed Bai Xuan\u2019s first time. He might\u2019ve been certain of his sexual orientation in advance but he didn\u2019t mess around with people. In addition, he had been playing the game with Li Cangyu for many years and had no time to find a boyfriend.</p><br/><p>In this regard, Bai Xuan was relatively conservative. From his point of view, two people should love each other before engaging in physical contact, rather than a casual overnight indulgence. He liked cleanliness and didn\u2019t want to go to bed casually. He wanted his first time to be with a lover who could keep up with him\u2026</p><br/><p>Was Xie Shurong that person? Bai Xuan didn\u2019t have much confidence right now. Perhaps t was because Ah Shu was young and didn\u2019t have much experience. It was ridiculous to talk to such a young person about \u2018long-term\u2019 topics. Ah Shu could still play for a few years and perhaps he would become tired of Bai Xuan after a few years. After all, he didn\u2019t like men before.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan thought this and couldn\u2019t help feeling a bit panicked. Xie Shurong had provoked him first but unconsciously, he had already put this person in his heart and even considered the possibility of keeping Xie Shurong\u2026</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan helplessly smiled and headed back home.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>That night, Xie Shurong resolved matters with cold water and sent a text message to Bai Xuan: [Reporting to Boss, my physical needs have been solved with cold water.] This was followed by a big smile.</p><br/><p>At that time, Bai Xuan was eating fruit with his uncle and cousin at the dinner table. Such a message suddenly popped on the screen and he nearly choked on his water. His face reddened and he immediately placed the phone back in his pocket.</p><br/><p>His cousin Bai Ning didn\u2019t discover this and continued to speak excitedly, \u201cBrother, I like Ah Shu in your team the most! His swordsman is really handsome. Can you ask him to give me a signature?\u201d</p><br/><p>His uncle said he was coming today to see Bai Xuan but in fact, he was taking his daughter to chat with Bai Xuan. Bai Ning\u2019s academic performance was relatively ordinary but she was particularly interested in e-sports. Her family had been opposed but then Bai Xuan won at the World Competition. Everyone\u2019s attitude towards e-sports changed and his uncle even wanted to let Bai Xuan train his daughter. Maybe the Bai family could have a female player!</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan was an only child and his relationship with his cousin had always been good. However, today his mood wasn\u2019t right and he casually replied, \u201cI will ask him for a signature another day. If you really want to play, you should do some basic training first before going to your favourite team for an interview.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then his phone made a nose again. Perhaps it was another text message from Xie Shurong. Bai Xuan wanted to check but he was afraid of his elders discovering something and could only endure the itchiness as he muted his phone. He never felt this way before. He only received a text message but he was feeling restless.</p><br/><p>HIs uncle and cousin soon left. Bai Xuan helped his mother clean the table. Then he returned to his bedroom, locked the door and opened his phone. It was a text message sent by Xie Shurong and there were even several of them.</p><br/><p>[Bai Xuan, did I scare you just now? You can rest assured that I\u2019m not a pervert. I just like you too much and we were playing on the bed. My body naturally reacted. Don\u2019t think too much!]</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan\u2019s face couldn\u2019t help heating up when he saw this. Ah Shu was a young man with healthy physiological problems. It was normal to have a reaction when playing with the person he liked on the bed. On the contrary, it was Bai Xuan who overreacted.</p><br/><p>[If Boss disagrees next time, I won\u2019t rush to ask for a raise.]</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan smiled and continued to read the next one.</p><br/><p>[It was so hard to become a formal employee and I will perform well. I will love you with all my heart, obey all your orders and be the best boyfriend.]</p><br/><p>[Thinking of you, Xiao Shu.]</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan was amused by the last message. Xiao Shu? This person was 1.85 metres tall. How could he say such words?</p><br/><p>[Okay, go to bed early.] Bai Xuan quickly sent a message followed by another one. [I miss you too.]</p><br/><p>His cheeks became even hotter.</p><br/><p>He had a mild personality and didn\u2019t understand how to express intense emotions. He always felt that everything should be calm. Now his fingers trembled when he sent the text message and his heart was so fast it almost burst out of his chest. It was definitely faster than the finals of the World Competition.</p><br/><p>He never experienced such a fierce reaction in his life but this feeling wasn\u2019t bad.</p><br/><p>His whole heart was violently beating for one person. It was as if the original calm waters were filled with a fresh vitality that disturbed the lake heart.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong received the text message and almost jumped from his bed with excitement. He shamelessly replied: [Love you.]</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan didn\u2019t reply again but his intense heartbeat seemed to clearly tell him that his feelings for Xie Shurong were much deeper than he imagined.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan\u2019s parents went on a trip the next day, stating they would go abroad for a week to widen their horizons.</p><br/><p>Mother Bai was very fond of Xie Shurong but knew from her knowledge of Bai Xuan that her son wasn\u2019t very careful about Xie Shurong while Xie Shurong was too good to Bai Xuan. Their feelings were unstable and it was time to cultivate them. Thus, she took her husband to go abroad to play, deliberately giving her son time and space to get along with that handsome person.</p><br/><p>Before going abroad, Mother Bai sent a message to Xie Shurong. [I am going to play with Uncle Bai from the 10th to the 17th. Bai Xuan is at home alone. If you have time, go to the house to find him and have him take you to good places in the surrounding cities.]</p><br/><p>[I know! Thank you Auntie! Be safe.] It was impossible for Xie Shurong to not understand Mother Bai\u2019s meaning. On the afternoon of the 10th, he actively carried his suitcase to Bai Xuan, stating that he came over to stay. Bai Xuan stared at the young man with a bright smile in front of him and got a headache. \u201cSince when have you been so familiar with my mother?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong explained, \u201cMother and I have a special fate. The day we washed dishes in the kitchen, we exchanged our WeChat.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This guy\u2019s hands were steady, touch and accurate, quickly grasping Mother Bai. That\u2019s why Mother Bai went abroad to give Xie Shurong a chance. She was obviously treating Xie Shurong as family.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong saw Bai Xuan\u2019s frown and reached out to pull the other person into his arms. He placed his chin on Bai Xuan\u2019s shoulder while taking a deep breath, eagerly taking in Bai Xuan\u2019s fresh scent. He whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s great. I can finally meet you every day. You don\u2019t know what it\u2019s been like the past two days, sleeping in the hotel while my brain is full of you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t have a ridiculous smile and was very serious. His low voice passed into Bai Xuan\u2019s ears like gently flowing water that penetrated a tiny gap in Bai Xuan\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan\u2019s heart was beating violently when he heard these words.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t help reaching out to gently hug the person in front of him.</p><br/><p>This young man was childish and over pretended to be wronged. He rolled around in bed like a child who hadn\u2019t grown up. However, sometimes the young man would speak seriously and frankly confess, the few simple words easily touching Bai Xuan.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan took a deep breath to steady his heart and inwardly, spoke, \u2018Xie Shurong, perhaps I really want to fall head first into your hands.\u2019\u2019</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He felt excited about \u2018finally learning to kiss\u2019 but felt sorrow at the \u2018person being Tan Shitian.\u2019 He rolled around in bed and thought for a long time. He didn\u2019t fall asleep until 3 o\u2019clock and ended up dreaming about being kissed by Tan Shitian\u2026</p><br/><p>He woke up and saw Captain Tan\u2019s calm face. Cheng Wei was embarrassed to look at him and rushed into the bathroom. The result was that he didn\u2019t pay attention and bumped into the glass.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian hurriedly came over and rubbed his forehead, asking softly, \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei avoided his gaze. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Cough, let\u2019s go for breakfast\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them went downstairs together and found the other players gathering around the breakfast buffet. The vice-captains of Canglan and Wind Colour were sitting at a table and Cheng Wei didn\u2019t hesitate to sit beside Cat God.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu asked doubtfully, \u201cWhat happened to your forehead?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei was too embarrassed to say that he stupidly walked into the glass door. Fortunately, Tan Shitian rescued him. \u201cI didn\u2019t pay attention and accidentally hit him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu nodded and didn\u2019t ask anymore questions. \u201cGo get breakfast. We will eat together before going to the venue.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Today\u2019s Carnival officially started at 10 in the morning and it was a six member team battle as everyone had long guessed.</p><br/><p>Yesterday the Frost Team had been helplessly defeated in the arena and the audience was most looking forward to today\u2019s team battle.</p><br/><p>The Frost Team had the two explosive players, Li Cangyu and Ling Xuefeng. Together with Cheng Wei\u2019s control, Chu Yan\u2019s assistance, Zhang Shaohui\u2019s assassination and Liu Xiang\u2019s healing, this team could directly enter the world competition and have a chance of winning when facing the top teams from the US and South Korea.</p><br/><p>On the Fire Team\u2019s side, they lacked an auxiliary but their output was very stable. Su Guangmo, Yu Pingsheng and Lou Wushuang were the three front row attackers, Yan Ruiwen added negative states and Tan Shitian could suppress from a distance. There was also the super-survival god\u2019s milk, Bai Xuan. This team was also top in the world.</p><br/><p>Many viewers were excited. [In fact, the Chinese Miracle players have improved quickly in the past two years. Last year\u2019s 3v3 victory at the World Carnival won\u2019t be the last championship we win!] [Seeing the great gods at the domestic Carnival, I think we might be able to get a prize in the World Competition!] [The seventh season isn\u2019t over yet. It is too early to worry about the World Competition!]</p><br/><p>The discussion in the live room was very lively. In order to better explain the game to the audience outside the stadium, the league had Yu Bing and Kou Hongyi come to commentate for everyone.</p><br/><p>At the Carnival, the host came forward with the microphone and smiled. \u201cAudience members, the last showdown of this year\u2019s Carnival is about to begin. I believe that everyone has already guessed today\u2019s matchup mode. It is the long expected six person team battle! The lineup of both sides is on the big screen. Who will be the commander of the game? Let\u2019s wait for news from the referee\u2019s side.\u201d</p><br/><p>The contestants on both sides had already sat down and submitted their commander to the referee.</p><br/><p>The Fire Team was commanded by Su Guangmo and the Frost Team was LI Cangyu.</p><br/><p>The temporary captains on both sides acted as commanders, which was expected by many people. It was only the Wind Colour fans who felt it was unfair. They didn\u2019t expect Captain Ling to give the command to that cat!</p><br/><p>In order to save time, today\u2019s team battle was only one game. The map was naturally randomly selected by the system.</p><br/><p>Half a minute later, the random map finally appeared on the big screen. It was Yisu City Square.</p><br/><p>This map wasn\u2019t very difficult. It was an ordinary map with a wide field of view and was fair to any class.</p><br/><p>The players sitting on the stage saw the map and looked very calm. Once the two sides refreshed at the birth point, Li Cangyu immediately deployed them. \u201cI will stay with Xiao Wei in the middle. Xuefeng will go with Liu Xiang and Vice-Captain Zhang will go with Chu Yan.\u201d</p><br/><p>The purpose of raising Zhang Shaohui and Ling Xuefeng\u2019s economy was very obvious. After all, the resources on the map were limited. Ling Xuefeng could gave a full income with a nanny and Zhang Shaohui could also pick up coins in the early stages.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu and Cheng Wei could only divide the resources of the wild area. Cheng Wei had no opinion on this. After all, this lineup didn\u2019t require him to be an output. He only needed to control the field.</p><br/><p>On the Fire Team\u2019s side, the splitting up was the same as yesterday\u2019s arena. The Su Yu combination still didn\u2019t split up, Tan and Yan were together while Bai and Zhang went to their allocated area.</p><br/><p>Yu Bing saw this scene and couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cToday\u2019s game is really a gathering of great gods. I guess that both sides will play conservatively early on. I just saw that Cheng Wei appeared in Tan Shitian\u2019s attack range but he didn\u2019t act and kept killing the mobs. The other two areas are the same. They want to stably develop first and the first wave of combat will probably be over the ice dragon.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was as Yu Bing said. Both sides had great gods and their mentality was relatively stable. They had an attitude of enjoying this game and didn\u2019t rush to attack.</p><br/><p>Once the first wave of mobs was cleared, the ice dragon refreshed on time.</p><br/><p>The turning point of a team battle was generally when the ice dragon refreshed. The team with the advantage could keep it by taking the ice dragon. The disadvantaged team could reverse the situation if they won the ice dragon. If there was an initial draw, winning the team economy boss would lay the foundation for a later victory.</p><br/><p>The ice dragon was definitely a resource both sides had to fight over. There was no need for a command as everyone consciously went to the refresh point.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu instructed while walking, \u201cCheng Wei and Chu Yan, try to control Bai Xuan. Vice-Captain Zhang, detour to the left side and stare at your brother. Xuefeng, you know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng hummed in agreement.</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei was curious. \u201cWhat does he know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui also asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiang was really speechless at the worrying IQs of these two people and reminded them, \u201cDon\u2019t be distracted. They\u2019re coming.\u201d</p><br/><p>The female captain\u2019s gentle voice made everyone calm down. Zhang Shaohui actively lurked to find Lou Wushuang while Cheng Wei and Chu Yan started reading their control skills.</p><br/><p>God\u2019s Seal!</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei\u2019s white magic aimed at Bai Xuan. Bai Xuan\u2019s pre-judgement ability was first-class. He moved to the side as if he guessed and successfully hid from this control.</p><br/><p>Psychic Array, Absolute Zero!</p><br/><p>This was Chu Yan\u2019s ranged silence array. The large array of the psychic often had a powerful group control effect. Tan Shitian and Yan Ruiwen had played remotely against Chu Yan many times. They were far away and naturally unaffected. However, the few people in the front row as well as Bai Xuan, who just moved a step into the array because he hid from Cheng Wei\u2019s skill, were affected.</p><br/><p>Kou Hongyi quickly said, \u201cCheng Wei and Chu Yan cleverly cooperated. Cheng Wei might\u2019ve wasted his control skill but he successfully pushed Bai Xuan into Chu Yan\u2019s skill\u2014oh my god, why are there so many pets on the field? My eyes are going blind!\u201d</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t blame Kou Hongyi for yelling. Many spectators were in the same state.</p><br/><p>The moment Chu Yan successfully controlled Bai Xuan, Li Cangyu summoned his four water, fire, wind and thunder spirits while Ling Xuefeng summoned his skeleton infantry, black crows, banshee and the demon god. This image was too beautiful!</p><br/><p>The audience became even more gobsmacked when Li Cangyu didn\u2019t hesitate to open Cataclysm and Ling Xuefeng didn\u2019t hesitate to open Demon God\u2019s Rage\u2026</p><br/><p>The result was a loud booming noise. The green light effect of the elves and the red light effect of the demons intertwined and flooded towards the three people controlled in the psychic\u2019s array!</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo lost 80% blood, Yu Pingsheng lost 70% blood, Bai Xuan lost 80% blood and the invisible Lou Wushuang was also hit\u2026</p><br/><p>The two people joined forces and directly disabled the three people on the opposite side!</p><br/><p>The audience couldn\u2019t calm down for a long time. Cheng Wei\u2019s eyes were dull and Zhang Shaohui was also shocked. Then Li Cangyu\u2019s voice pulled them back from their thoughts. \u201cWhat are you doing? Hurry and use your moves!\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei immediately reacted and excitedly opened the white magician\u2019s big move, Ice Storm. Zhang Shaohui wasn\u2019t far behind and used Fatal Blow on Yu Pingsheng!</p><br/><p>[Only Dedication has killed White Fox!]</p><br/><p>[Only Dedication has killed Grey Wolf!]</p><br/><p>[Shadow has killed Smog of Rain!]</p><br/><p>Three people on the Fire Team died in an instant. The audience couldn\u2019t believe it\u2026</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo helplessly looked at his scene. He thought that Cat God would play more conservatively today. Who would\u2019ve thought he would be so fierce?</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo directly wrote: [GG!]</p><br/><p>GG was an abbreviation for \u2018good game.\u2019 It originated from a confrontation between two high level e-sports players many years ago. One of them made his character say this praise before exiting the competition. It meant the opponent \u2018played very well. This game is good.\u2019</p><br/><p>Later, the two letters GG had a variety of usages in e-sports. Sometimes, GG was used to directly give up while some seniors used it to praise the younger generation.</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo used it as a pun. In addition to appreciating the cooperation between Ling and Cat, there was also the meaning of directly surrendering.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian followed by joking on the public channel: [The summoners have released their outbreak. I don\u2019t think it is necessary to fight anymore.]</p><br/><p>The dead Bai Xuan agreed. [Ling Cat can\u2019t be on the same screen. They are simply a biological weapon.]</p><br/><p>[Captain Ling and Cat God have a total of eight pets. It is equivalent to a 6v14 fight!] Cheng Wei excitedly typed.</p><br/><p>He finally understood what Li Cangyu meant by \u2018Xuefeng, you know\u2019. These two people really had a connection. Cataclysm and Demon God\u2019s Rage were difficult skills. Today, under Li Cangyu\u2019s delicate layout, they actually opened the big moves at the same time and directly killed the Fire Team.</p><br/><p>No one else had this tacit understanding.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the mood of many Captain Ling and Cat God fans were somewhat complicated. Before, they were arguing for several days on the forum about who the best summoner was. Now they saw the horrible scene of both summoners together and couldn\u2019t help becoming fans.</p><br/><p>[In fact, Cat God is very handsome!] A Captain Ling fan weakly said. [It isn\u2019t easy for him to stick around for so many years. Can we still blacken him?]</p><br/><p>[Don\u2019t blacken, don\u2019t blacken. It is all gone! The two of them have such a good relationship. How can the fans argue?]</p><br/><p>[The gorgeous skills of Captain Ling and Cat God together crashed my computer\u2026]</p><br/><p>[They are really strong together. They are both fierce players and their hand speed is over 500APM. The instantaneous output is amazing! It is fortunate they aren\u2019t in the same team or the other teams can\u2019t last!]</p><br/><p>In the commentators\u2019 room, Yu Bing saw this scene with a complicated expression.</p><br/><p>She originally thought that today\u2019s team battle would last for half an hour. The result was that it ended in less than 10 minutes. The Fire Team directly admitted defeat. This might have an element of joking but it was also a great affirmation of the Ling Cat team.</p><br/><p>At this point, the two people at the centre of the discussion were extremely calm. They were long accustomed to this cooperation.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu didn\u2019t have to think about where Ling Xuefeng would summon his pets and Ling Xuefeng didn\u2019t have to worry about interfering with Li Cangyu\u2019s rhythm. They just needed to fight according to their own ideas and their skills combined perfectly.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu glanced over at Ling Xuefeng and saw the deep confirmation, appreciation and affection that only Li Cangyu could understand in his eyes.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu couldn\u2019t help smiling and patted Ling Xuefeng on the shoulder. \u201cWell done.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng leaned over and whispered in his ear, \u201cToday is the first time we have cooperated in public but it is just the beginning.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu remembered their agreement regarding the national team and he naturally understood Ling Xuefeng\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>One day, they would become the most tacit teammates and head towards the wider world\u2014the World Competition!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

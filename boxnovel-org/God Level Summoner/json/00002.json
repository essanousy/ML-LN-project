This was the ultimate result of the struggle and everyone felt uncomfortable. However, many people had reached the age of retirement. Plus, their own gaming level was average. It was really time to find another path.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu sent them away one by one, although he couldn\u2019t help feeling a hint of sourness in his heart.</p><br/><p>The nature of a competition was cruel. Some people would win and others would lose. The end of the Canglan team was tragic. Fortunately, a few teammates found good jobs. As captain of the team, he could feel a bit more at ease.</p><br/><p>At noon, Li Cangyu ushered in a surprise visitor. It was Liu Chuan, manager of the Dragon Warriors team.</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan was less than 30 years old and was currently the youngest team manager in China. He was also an e-sports player. He created the Dragon Warriors team and led the team to win the championship. After retiring, he naturally became the person behind the Dragon Warriors Club and was also invited to join the E-sports Alliance as the executive director. In the domestic e-sports circle, he was a famous and promising person.</p><br/><p>This person was always looking at the long term. It was the reason why Li Cangyu chose to cooperate with him.</p><br/><p>Today, Liu Chuan was wearing a handsome khaki long trench coat over a simple white shirt. Just looking at his figure, he was definitely the level of a model. However, there were big sunglasses on his face as well as a mask, ensuring his face was tightly covered.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu laughed at the sight and asked, \u201cDressing like this, were you chased by the paparazzi?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan took off his sunglasses and spoke helplessly. \u201cThe Dragon Warriors team just won the championship. The e-sports reporters have been blocking the entrance of the team for the past few days. I had to dress like this to sneak out.\u201d</p><br/><p>One of them was the manager of a championship club while the other was a desperate captain who just experienced the disbandment of his team. This strong contrast seemed to show Li Cangyu\u2019s failure.</p><br/><p>But Li Cangyu showed no signs of inferiority or distress. He made a calm \u2018please\u2019 gesture and smiled. \u201cCome in and chat. I didn\u2019t think that one day, I would actually be talking to you about cooperating.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect it either.\u2019 Liu Chuan smiled and followed him into the house.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan had booked a ticket for a few days later. At present, he was still staying with the team to sort things out in the meeting room. After seeing that Liu Chuan came, he took the initiative to give them hot tea and said, \u201cYou talk. I will go back to the dormitory first to pack my luggage.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, you are busy with your own things.\u201d Li Cangyu said.</p><br/><p>Once Bai Xuan left, Liu Chuan opened his mouth and asked, \u201cAre you disbanding the Canglan team?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Li Cangyu nodded.</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan saw his calm expression and couldn\u2019t help patting him on the should. \u201cI won\u2019t say any words to comfort you. I don\u2019t think you need it. I heard rumours that Canglan was going to be disbanded. However, when your team disbanded last time, you took your teammates and transferred to Wulin. This time, I thought you would continue to form a new team and never thought about contacting you. I was really surprised when you called me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu asked directly. \u201cCan you accept me into the Dragon Warriors team?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCertainly.\u201d Liu Chuan laughed. \u201cIt is my wish.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat position do you plan to place me on the team?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you come over, I\u2019ll make you the captain.\u201d Liu Chuan didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cWouldn\u2019t any other position be disrespectful to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will be the captain?\u201d Li Cangyu was obviously a little surprised. \u201cWhat about the current captain, Wu Zewen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy family\u2019s Zewen is naturally still the captain.\u201d Liu Chuan smiled and continued, \u201cThe two of you won\u2019t come into conflict.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu understood what Liu Chuan meant. \u201cDo you want to build two teams?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Liu Chuan\u2019s expression became serious as he gazed at Li Cangyu. \u201cCat God, I won\u2019t speak secretively. You actively sought me out so you should also be thinking about this. There are many comprehensive overseas e-sports clubs. Their clubs have a business model where they are developing simultaneously in several games. China\u2019s Dragon Warriors team will follow this precedent and set up a team in both Wulin and Miracle. When I created Dragon Warriors, I said that I had to expand Dragon Warriors into a domestic first-class comprehensive club, providing e-sports players with the best platform. In the past few years, I have been looking for a suitable opportunity\u2026.Now that opportunity has finally come. You should know what I mean.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean\u2026the Miracle World Competition.\u201d Li Cangyu saw Liu Chuan\u2019s nod and continued. \u201cI\u2019ve heard some news about the Miracle World Competition. Miracle has been in operation for six years. It has its own professional leagues in various countries and many masters have emerged. Now the game headquarters wants to launch a world competition to expand its influence. It is indeed a ripe time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Liu Chuan agreed. \u201cI will take advantage of this opportunity to form a team to enter Miracle. Recently, I have been looking for a suitable leader. If you join, it really is a timely rain!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want me to lead a team back to Miracle?\u201d Li Cangyu asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that your own wish?\u201d Liu Chuan replied.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Indeed.\u201d After being poked by the other party, Li Cangyu no longer disguised it as he smiled. \u201cI have missed my summoner in the two years that I left Miracle. Of course, it would be good if I could go back.\u201d</p><br/><p>This is why Li Cangyu looked for Liu Chuan.</p><br/><p>He had long seen that Liu Chuan was ambitious and interested in the Miracle Alliance.</p><br/><p>After all, Miracle was the first competitive online game that Li Cangyu played. He might\u2019ve gone to Wulin for two years but he couldn\u2019t forget the summoner created when he first entered Miracle at a young age. It was his favourite game character.</p><br/><p>He went round and round and actually returned to his original point. Li Cangyu didn\u2019t feel frustrated or ashamed. He was actually very happy.</p><br/><p>He could operate his summoner again!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is best if you go back. But returning to Miracle will be a great challenge for you. You must think clearly.\u201d Liu Chuan looked at him seriously. \u201cYou have been away from Miracle for two years. The Miracle League has developed rapidly after many large-scale updates. The competitive rules have changed as well as the league system. You will have to start from scratch after you go back, as well as re-adapt.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan was right. Two years was enough to make a game new.</p><br/><p>However, Li Cangyu didn\u2019t mind this. Instead, he smiled confident and declared, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I will start from the beginning.\u201d</p><br/><p>The name \u2018Cat God\u2019 originated from Miracle. Its final destination should also be there.</p><br/><p>He had been able to turn a rookie who didn\u2019t know anything into a superb summoner of Miracle. Now, he had the foundation of many games as well as competition experience. He didn\u2019t believe that he would be weaker than that time!</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan saw the confident expression on Li Cangyu\u2019s face and couldn\u2019t help patting him on the shoulder in appreciation. \u201cThen the mission of the Dragon Fighters club is to enter Miracle. Can I confidently give this mission to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>This was a very difficult task that was likely to be full of twists and turns. But Liu Chuan believed that Li Cangyu would be able to raise this team. It was because the light in the man\u2019s eyes hadn\u2019t faded despite experiencing many failures.</p><br/><p>He could get up from where he fell.</p><br/><p>Cat God who climbed up, this time he would make everyone admire him.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu nodded seriously at the sight of Liu Chuan\u2019s trusting eyes and said, \u201cRest assured, I will do my best.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan smiled and stretched out his hand. \u201cThen, shall we cooperate happily?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu reached out his hand and shook it. \u201cHappy cooperation!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two people had simple personalities and the negotiations were quick. Both of them had the same goal and they clicked together.</p><br/><p>For Liu Chuan, the emergence of Li Cangyu solved his urgent problem. Good players weren\u2019t hard to find, but finding a good captain was difficult!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Miracle Professional League is held once a year. This year, you won\u2019t be able to catch up. We are half a year away from next year\u2019s league. You can take a break and practice. Wait until next spring. You will directly lead a team to kill Miracle. What do you think?\u201d Liu Chuan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d Li Cangyu said.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will help you with the transfer procedures. You just need to prepare to go back to Miracle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan was the executive director of China\u2019s E-sports Alliance. The process of changing games was naturally easy for him. Li Cangyu felt relieved that Liu Chuan was helping with this and said, \u201cThen I will trouble you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo polite!\u201d Liu Chuan smiled and spoke again. \u201cYes, you should also think of a name for the new team. It is too ugly to have two Dragon Warriors. We should have separate names or the fans might become confused.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Li Cangyu agreed. \u201cWhy not keep the name Canglan? I\u2019m incompetent when it comes to naming things.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you decide this name?\u201d Liu Chuan was obviously surprised.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu and explained, \u201cXiao Bai named it. He is more talented than I am.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Bai was the nickname that Li Cangyu commonly used for Bai Xuan, the vice-captain of Canglan and a god-level healer.</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan couldn\u2019t help being curious at the mention of Bai Xuan. \u201cI just heard the vice-captain say he was going to pack. Is he going somewhere?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Li Cangyu was helpless. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to continue playing and is preparing to go abroad to study.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan frowned. \u201cHis ability is good. Isn\u2019t it a pity for him to leave like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think so too.\u201d Li Cangyu looked in Bai Xuan\u2019s direction and spoke in a low voice. \u201cI will try to convince him. He is my best vice-captain. I can\u2019t bear it if he runs away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. It is best for him to stay. If both of you come to the team, I will have a vice-captain and won\u2019t need to worry!\u201d Liu Chuan happily patted Li Cangyu\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cI will go back to Changsha to arrange things. Come see me when it is convenient and I will help you clean the dormitory.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no hurry. I will wait until one month before the start of next year\u2019s professional league. If I go to the Dragon Warriors club too early, I would have to wear sunglasses every day to hide from the paparazzi.\u201d Li Cangyu spoke seriously. \u201cI hope that the matter of our cooperation will temporarily be confidential.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d Liu Chuan nodded and stood up. \u201cI will wait in Changsha for you after the spring festival next year. We will sign the contract first.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, he took a laptop out of his bag and found the contract template for the Dragon Warriors club to sign an e-sports player. Then he added another zero to the salary.</p><br/><p>Giving such a high salary proved he attached great importance to Li Cangyu. This was indeed the treatment for the captain of a team.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t easy to meet a boss who truly appreciated him. Li Cangyu knew that his cooperation with Liu Chuan was really the right choice.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled and signed the printed contract.</p><br/><p>The two people did things in a straightforward manner. They quickly finalized the cooperation plan before Liu Chuan hurried away in his sunglasses and mask. He said there was an E-sports Association meeting tonight in Beijing to wrap up the summer. He had to be at the airport for his flight.</p><br/><p>After sending away Liu Chuan, Li Cangyu returned to the dormitory. He opened the door to see Bai Xuan leaning down to pack.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan\u2019s skin was very white and his facial features were gentle. He felt particularly gentle when he smiled. Bai Xuan was very good-tempered. No matter how others provoked him, he always smiled and never became angry. In addition to arranging the daily training of the players, he was also a good cook. He was the best super stay-at-home dad.</p><br/><p>If it hadn\u2019t been for his help over the many years, the team established by Li Cangyu wouldn\u2019t have persisted to the present.</p><br/><p>Now that he was leaving, Li Cangyu didn\u2019t want to give up. He walked over and whispered, \u201cBai Xuan, please don\u2019t quit.\u201d</p><hr/><br/><p>TL Note: Liu Chuan and Wu Zewen are the main characters and couple of the first novel in the trilogy. The first novel was about them setting up the Dragon Warrior Team and eventually turning it into a club.</p><hr/><br/>\n</div>"}

Then they could change the list for the remaining games. This was to give the away team a chance to adjust strategies and prevent the advantage of the home team from being too big.</p><br/><p>During the intermission time, Ling Xuefeng calmly brought the team members together and explained the tactical arrangements again. On the Canglan side, Li Cangyu\u2019s expression had obviously relaxed as he analyzed how to deal with the next game.</p><br/><p>The atmosphere in both soundproof rooms seemed a bit tense and the audience members stared nervously at the big screen.</p><br/><p>In the commentators\u2019 room, Yu Bing spoke briefly on the last round before analyzing the next lineup arrangement. \u201cThe combinations on the Wind Colour team might not necessarily be the same, apart from the Yan Guo combination which won\u2019t be broken apart. It is possible for Captain Ling to take a healer or to form a double summoners combination with Xu Feifan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kou Hongyi said, \u201cOn the Canglan side, the Shu Bai combination should be second. I think that Li Cangyu might play with his apprentice Xiao Han. It is also possible to keep the previous lineup of Xiao Han and Old Zhang, Cat God and Xiao Gu. In addition, Zhuo Hang and Li Xiaojiang might not appear today. It is because the Zhuo Li combination has no advantage over the black magicians.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Bing agreed. \u201cThe Zhuo Li combination might not have a chance to play today\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She just finished when the second game began. The map submitted by Ling Xuefeng was still Dark Grotto and the first combination sent by the Canglan team was Zhuo Hang and Li Xiaojiang!</p><br/><p>Yu Bing was expressionless despite being hit in the face but she couldn\u2019t help inwardly thinking, \u2018Cat God, your train of thought is really unfathomable! What are you doing by sending Li Xiaojiang against Wind Colour? Do you want to hone the small teenager again?\u2019</p><br/><p>The thing that surprised Yu Bing even more was that Lin Ke and Xu Feifan were sent in the first round.</p><br/><p>Well, Captain Ling\u2019s thoughts were also unfathomable.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>It was reasonable to say that Zhuo Hang and Li Xiaojiang didn\u2019t have much chance of winning against Wind Colour. However, Wind Colour sent the newcomer Lin Ke in the first round so Zhuo Hang gained a bit more confidence.</p><br/><p>On this map, Xiao Li\u2019s movements were slower and there weren\u2019t many advantages. However, Zhuo Hang\u2019s speed was fast. He could set traps around the stone pillars and protect Li Xiaojiang. It wasn\u2019t impossible to fight.</p><br/><p>The two sides circled each other in the grotto. Li Xiaojiang took the lead in finding an opportunity. He used Dark Fear and controlled Lin Ke. Zhuo Hang immediately followed up with Trap Blast and Lin Ke\u2019s blood decreased.</p><br/><p>Lin Ke probably had too little experience in the competition. He had been overtaken by Li Cangyu and his mentality wasn\u2019t very stable. This meant he wasn\u2019t cautious enough in the second game. However, he quickly reacted by controlling Zhuo Hang. Then Xu Feifan used his pets and hit Zhuo Hang.</p><br/><p>The two sides struggled and dragged the battle out to 10 minutes.</p><br/><p>In the end, the Zhuo Li combination was killed. Li Xiaojiang fought hard to kill Lin Ke and finally died under Xu Feifan\u2019s hands. Xu Feifan was the only one left from Wind Colour and it could be said that the advantage wasn\u2019t big.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was very pleased with the performance of Zhuo Li. He sent these two because Xiaojiang hadn\u2019t played in the last game. If Xiaojiang sat on the bench for two consecutive games, his recent excellent state might not be maintained. He wanted to see the results of Xiaojiang\u2019s training and was very satisfied.</p><br/><p>He patted the shoulders of the two teenagers and had them sit down. Then Canglan sent the Shu Bai combination.</p><br/><p>There was almost no accidents. Shu Bai often played in the second round. They would expand the advantage and try to catch up if there was a disadvantage. In this game. the initial advantage wasn\u2019t big so Xie Shurong and Bai Xuan steadily maintained it to the end.</p><br/><p>Then look at the third stage!</p><br/><p>Wind Colour actually sent Qin Mo and He Qun!</p><br/><p>Many Wind Colour fans were angry.</p><br/><p>[What happened to Captain Ling today?] [He is just sitting there. What does he want to do?] [Captain Ling, are you shy about seeing your old friend Cat God? Come out and kill Cat God!]</p><br/><p>No matter how anxious the audience became, Ling Xuefeng maintained his blank expression. The handsome face with almost no flaws filled the screen. The man sat there, as cold as a statue, as his deep eyes stared at the screen.</p><br/><p>The final combination for Canglan was Li Cangyu and Zhang Jueming. Thanks to the help of Old Zhang, Li Cangyu ruthlessly broke out and killed Wind Colour\u2019s sacrifice.</p><br/><p>Yu Bing\u2019s opening analysis was that only players with a strong explosive power could break the Qin Mo and He Qun combination. Undoubtedly, Li Cangyu was one of the best at unleashing his power in the Miracle League. The blood cow combination couldn\u2019t drag out the time in front of him.</p><br/><p>The Canglan team won!</p><br/><p>Even professional players watching the game in front of the TV were somewhat confused by this result.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs Ling Xuefeng throwing the game today?\u201d Zhang Shaohui couldn\u2019t help saying in Ghost Spirits\u2019 dormitory. \u201cWind Colour might be ranked first on the leaderboard but it is too much to lose two consecutive games to Canglan. He is obvious throwing the match!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t throwing the match. You shouldn\u2019t only look at the surface.\u201d Lou Wushuang pushed up his glasses and explained coldly. \u201cThis match has no influence on the rankings, regardless of winning or losing. He is taking this rare opportunity to let the players increase their insight and challenge the strongest summoner. This action shows that Li Cangyu\u2019s weight in his heart is incomparable to other gods.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui\u2019s face was blank. \u201cAh? Is this true?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang resisted the urge to hit his stupid head. \u201cNonsense! Do you think Ling Xuefeng is the type of person to throw a match? Look at the arrangements of the regular season. This is a home match in Shanghai. The order of the second round is reversed and Wind Colour\u2019s first opponents will be Canglan. Maybe Canglan will enter the playoffs this year and they might meet in the playoffs. There is no need to expose every tactic in the first match. Ling Xuefeng obviously is holding back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui suddenly realized. \u201cOh, he is far-sighted and considering the next matches?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui smiled and scratched his head. \u201cBrother, you\u2019re so smart. I didn\u2019t think of this at all!\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang could calmly see Ling Xuefeng\u2019s thoughts but the netizens might not understand. They didn\u2019t accuse Ling Xuefeng of throwing the match but there were many fans dissatisfied with Wind Colour\u2019s arrangement today.</p><br/><p>The third game started quickly. Wind Colour and Canglan fought fiercely in the first two rounds. The combination of Yan Guo and Shu Bai reached the point of their blue being empty. Finally, it was the critical guard round. The fans of both teams nervously watched the big screen.</p><br/><p>Wind Colour\u2019s appearance list: Shepherd, Undead Demon.</p><br/><p>Canglan\u2019s appearance list: Frost Descends, Old Cat.</p><br/><p>At this moment, not only were the audience members at the venue jumping excitedly, the professional players watching on TV were also excited.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng and Qin Mo against Li Cangyu and Xiao Han!</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng, the strongest demon player finally appeared with his apprentice in the third stage. Coincidentally, the Ling Xuefeng duo actually confronted Li Cangyu who was also playing with his apprentice!</p><br/><p>The mentoring group VS mentoring group, this alone was enough to grab the attention of the reporters.</p><br/><p>Kou Hongyi couldn\u2019t help saying. \u201cCanglan and Wind Colour\u2019s white blue and black red uniforms are like couples outfits. Both sides have a small prince and the captains are summoners. They really feel like destined opponents!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

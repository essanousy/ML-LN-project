They chatted for three minutes without doing any actions, causing the system to give them a warning. [Don\u2019t be passive in the game or the online account will be sealed.]</p><br/><p>Qin Mo was speechless. The two of them chatted so much that the system had to give a warning.</p><br/><p>In order to prevent some people from holding up their opponents in the arena, three minutes of no action would be regarded negatively and the system would give a warning. After the warning, the account would be sealed.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu saw this warning and moved the Fish Farming Professional a few steps forward. He operated his elf summoner while typing on the public screen: [Xiao Han, Qin Mo, the two of you fight.]</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng agreed with this. [Okay.]</p><br/><p>Xiao Han wondered, \u201cMaster, you aren\u2019t going to fight?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu thought, \u2018I rarely see Ling Xuefeng in the arena and naturally want to chat with him. How can we fight when we\u2019ve just met? It is good to leave the fighting to the apprentices while the masters have an emotional exchange.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cI will watch.\u201d Li Cangyu stated decisively. \u201cCome, let me see if you have improved recently.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han stepped forward and started to PK with Qin Mo.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t the first time he fought with Qin Mo. In the beginning, he didn\u2019t have any experience facing a blood kin summoner and was often killed by Qin Mo. Sometimes he wouldn\u2019t even last half a minute. Later, he had a long training period with Qin Mo and gradually discovered the way to deal with Qin Mo. Now Xiao Han found that it wasn\u2019t as hard to play against Qin Mo.</p><br/><p>This time, Xiao Han was very active. He entered stealth and looked for opportunities. Once Qin Mo summoned four blood kin pets to suppress him, he calmly bypassed the pets\u2019 encirclement and came to Qin Mo\u2019s back. His daggers fell and the crit directly reduced Qin Mo\u2019s blood by 15%.</p><br/><p>Qin Mo wasn\u2019t anxious. After Xiao Han appeared, he quickly summoned his death knight to resist the next wave of damage. At the same time, he had his blood spider return and fix Xiao Han\u2019s body in place while he quickly retreated. The blood snake also tangled around Xiao Han and used the blood-sucking effect, so that Qin Mo\u2019s blood volume instantly surpassed Xiao Han\u2019s blood.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu saw that their two apprentices were starting to fight seriously and sent a private message to Ling Xuefeng: [I heard you are still staying with the team?]</p><br/><p>He naturally just heard this from Qin Mo.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng said: [Yes.]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was concerned: [Aren\u2019t you going home for the holidays?]</p><br/><p>[There are some things in the team that I need to deal with. I will go home for the Spring Festival.] Ling Xuefeng paused before asking: [What about things on your side?]</p><br/><p>[It is well. I\u2019ve gathered eight people.] Li Cangyu explained: [Your method really worked. I opened my identity and recruited for the team. Someone voluntarily came to the door to recommend himself. He is an elf hunter and very talented. Thus, I accepted him.]</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s not bad.] Ling Xuefeng asked: [Are you busy with training your teammates?]</p><br/><p>[Yes, many new people on my team haven\u2019t played competitively. They haven\u2019t been systematically trained and need to start from scratch.] Li Cangyu spoke emotionally: [Thanks to this group of youngsters, I feel like a father rather than a captain.]</p><br/><p>[You should pay attention to your rest and don\u2019t work too hard.] Ling Xuefeng typed.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was startled. Was Ling Xuefeng caring about him? This was concern, wasn\u2019t it?</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu felt a ripple in his heart. If it wasn\u2019t for the computer, he would pounce on Ling Xuefeng and kiss him, saying, \u201cI\u2019m not working hard. You also shouldn\u2019t work too hard.\u201d The captain staying behind while on holiday, this was really too dedicated.</p><br/><p>The two people operated their accounts in the game while chatting. Five minutes passed and they saw a prompt on the screen: [Side Account Name is Difficult to Decide has killed Wintry Twelfth Lunar Month.</p><br/><p>They looked back and found that Xiao Han had fallen while surrounded by blood kin pets while Qin Mo\u2019s blood volume was at 20%.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng opened the battle panel and read the records. Qin Mo relied on the blood snake and vampire bats\u2019 big moves to instantly kill Xiao Han. Xiao Han was able to fight with Qin Mo for five minutes, showing the rapid progress he was making under the guidance of Li Cangyu.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu turned back to Xiao Han and praised him. \u201cYou played well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han lost but Qin Mo was the winner of the sixth season\u2019s Best Newcomer Award. The team\u2019s systematic training and arena experience allowed Xiao Han to last for five minutes. Li Cangyu was already satisfied with this.</p><br/><p>Resurrection wasn\u2019t allowed in the arena. Xiao Han lay on the ground and typed in the area channel: [Master, what should we do about this round?]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu said: [Of course we will win. Xuefeng, stand still. I will kill you okay?]</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng: [Okay.]</p><br/><p>Qin Mo, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mo wanted to vomit up three litres of blood. He managed to win against Xiao Han and as a result, Master completely disregarded his principles and gave the game to Cat God. As the person at the bottom of the food chain, Qin Mo felt that he should directly concede to Cat God in the future!</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu happily used a set of moves to kill Ling Xuefeng.</p><br/><p>Qin Mo also didn\u2019t move as he let Cat God kill him. Li Cangyu saw the word \u2018victory\u2019 on his screen and was naturally in a good mood. He typed: [Thank you. [Kiss][Kiss].]</p><br/><p>Qin Mo, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han was puzzled. \u201cMaster, did you send the wrong emoji?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu thought, \u2018Fool, your master is sending this to Ling Xuefeng, not Qin Mo.\u2019</p><br/><p>However, Captain Ling seemed quite calm and he replied with: [You\u2019re welcome.]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu imagined the man\u2019s handsome and abstinent face and suddenly had an itchy feeling. He wanted to hold this man like in the New York hospital and see a different expression on his face.</p><br/><p>They exited from the arena and Li Cangyu smoothly added Ling Xuefeng\u2019s side account as a friend.</p><br/><p>He saw Xiao Han beside him and couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cXiao Han, you team up with Qin Mo.\u201d</p><br/><p>The teenager sitting beside him looked surprised. \u201cMaster, why should I group up with Qin Mo?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu explained seriously, \u201cYou and Qin Mo should play the pairs arena. Cooperating with a blood kin summoner is very good for gaining more ideas.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han nodded. \u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>At the same time. Ling Xuefeng sent Qin Mo a private chat message: [You go with Xiao Han to play the qualifiers.]</p><br/><p>Qin Mo was surprised but he habitually obeyed his master\u2019s orders and had to reply: [Okay!]</p><br/><p>Thus, the two small apprentices (small lightbulbs) were grouped together.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu privately sent to Ling Xuefeng: [The children are playing on their own. How about we team up?]</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng: [Yes.]</p><br/><p>The two connected hearts formed a pairs team and joined the qualifiers.</p><br/><p>As a result, the system seemed to be incompatible with them. The first match was actually against Xiao Han and Qin Mo!</p><br/><p>The four people once again entered the arena.</p><br/><p>Qin Mo, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Master, are you so good? Driving away your apprentice by saying that teaming up with a different class can open new ideas. In fact, the most fundamental reason is for the both of you to team up together, right?\u2019</p><br/><p>Xiao Han suddenly felt as if he realized something.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu saw the familiar \u2018Side Account Name is Difficult to Decide\u2019 and \u2018Wintry Twelfth Lunar Month\u2019. He was a bit embarrassed but he still typed seriously: [You don\u2019t have a master with you. You have to try your best and see how many games you can win with your level. Come back and report to me later.]</p><br/><p>Xiao Han: [Yes.]</p><br/><p>Qin Mo: [Yes.]</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng: [You aren\u2019t allowed to give up this game. Fight well.]</p><br/><p>Xiao Han: [Oh.]</p><br/><p>Qin Mo: [Yes.]</p><br/><p>The two apprentices were tossed by their masters and didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng told them to fight well but actually\u2026 he joined forces with Li Cangyu and killed Qin Mo and Xiao Han in one minute.</p><br/><p>The two apprentices lay on the ground with dazed expressions.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu typed: [Look at you, fool and fool. You don\u2019t know how to cooperate with each other. Quickly go and practice.]</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng also echoed his words: [Qin Mo, bring Xiao Han with you. Try to cooperate with a melee. This is also a good experience for you.]</p><br/><p>The two apprentices, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Making us fight each other while the two of you are chatting next to each other.</p><br/><p>After a while, you let us team up and cooperate with each other, while the two of you go off together!\u2019</p><br/><p>The pressure was really too big as their apprentices.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

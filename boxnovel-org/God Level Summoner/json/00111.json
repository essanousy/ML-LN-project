Before coming to the Ling home, Li Cangyu always thought that Ling Xuefeng\u2019s parents would also be very serious and difficult to please. He hadn\u2019t expected Mother Ling to be so enthusiastic before even receiving the gifts. He was pulled into the house.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu recovered his spirit and immediately handed the gifts to Mother Ling. He smiled politely and said, \u201cAuntie, I brought you and Uncle some small gifts. Happy holidays.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mother Ling took it with a smile. \u201cWhy are you so polite? You should treat my house like your own house. Bringing gifts is too much. You aren\u2019t allowed to bring them in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCough.\u201d Ling Xuefeng coughed and said, \u201cMom, let\u2019s eat first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, eat first. Xiao Li, come in and sit down. I\u2019ll serve you!\u201d Mother Ling placed Li Cangyu\u2019s gifts to the side and brought out plates from the kitchen. It was a full table of gourmet dishes.</p><br/><p>Such a sumptuous table of food was definitely the standard for entertaining guests.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was puzzled and couldn\u2019t help asking Ling Xuefeng, \u201cYou told your mother I was coming over?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Ling Xuefeng calmly nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cAuntie is too enthusiastic. She made so many delicious dishes.\u201d Li Cangyu smiled at Mother Ling who was busy in the kitchen. Then he looked at Ling Xuefeng\u2019s expressionless face and couldn\u2019t help laughing. \u201cIt seems like your personality is more like your father\u2019s?\u201d</p><br/><p>He just said this when somebody opened the door and entered. Li Cangyu looked up and saw a middle-aged man with deep eyes. This man was 70% similar to Ling Xuefeng. He was tall and looked more stable than Ling Xuefeng. His expression was cold and serious. He looked very difficult to handle.</p><br/><p>This should be Father Ling right?</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu immediately took the initiative to stand up and politely greeted him. \u201cUncle is well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Ling Boyan replied softly. He looked carefully at Li Cangyu and saw that this man\u2019s smile was straightforward and bright, making people feel that he was very sincere. He didn\u2019t look like an impetuous young person. Rather, he gave off a decent first impression.</p><br/><p>Ling Boyan changed into slippers and saw that his wife was busy in the kitchen. He sat down at the table and asked Li Cangyu, \u201cAre you Xiao Li?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu nodded. \u201cYes, Uncle. My name is Li Cangyu. You can call me Xiao Li.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow long have you known Xuefeng?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMore than six years. We met when we were 17 and 18.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Ling Boyan nodded. \u201cXuefeng has never brought a friend home for dinner. You are the first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu glanced at Ling Xuefeng and smiled. \u201cIs that so? The two of us have a good relationship, like brothers.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This guy really had first-class acting. The person who secretly kissed him last night was now acting like \u2018good brothers\u2019 in front of the family?</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu thought he had covered it up very well. He continued to chat with Uncle Ling in order to build up a good relationship.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do your parents do?\u201d Ling Boyan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy parents are doctors. They are a Western doctor and Chinese doctor. My sister is also a doctor.\u201d Li Cangyy answered seriously.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen how did you run to play e-sports?\u201d Ling Boyan\u2019s face was filled with doubts.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is because I\u2019m not very interested in studying medicine. I feel that playing the game is more suitable for me.\u201d Li Cangyu said with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, is this checking an account?\u201d Ling Xuefeng interrupted the strange conversation with a displeased expression.</p><br/><p>Ling Boyan stated gravely, \u201cI am just understanding your friend\u2019s basic situation. What\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu agreed. \u201cYes, Uncle is right. He just wants to understand your friends. This is him caring about you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Boyan suddenly felt that the young man in front of him was very interesting and polite to his elders. Ling Boyan stared at Li Cangyu and saw his bright smile. Ling Boyan stopped asking questions. He believed in the look in this person\u2019s eyes. The person brought back by his son should be a good person.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng\u2019s mother, Yuan Xin, quickly brought out the last dish, which was fragrant braised fish.</p><br/><p>She placed the fish next to Li Cangyu and smiled. \u201cI heard from Xuefeng that you love fish. I made braised fish for you. Come and try it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you Auntie.\u201d Li Cangyu stood up and pulled the chair next to him out in a gentlemanly manner. \u201cAuntie, come and sit down. We have to eat together or the food will become cold.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yuan Xin, who had her chair pulled out for her, laughed and sat down. \u201cXiao Li is sensible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng watched this scene and couldn\u2019t help the raising the corners of his mouth slightly.</p><br/><p>It seemed that his parents were very satisfied with Li Cangyu?</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The meal was delicious. Li Cangyu was straightforward and his desire to curry favour with Ling Xuefeng\u2019s parents had him politely giving the two elders dishes at dinner. Yuan Xin was full of smiles.</p><br/><p>After dinner, Li Cangyu got up and took the initiative to help clean up the dishes but was blocked by Yuan Xin. \u201cYou are a guest. How can I let you clean up? I will clean up! Xuefeng, you accompany Xiao Li to eat fruit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng agreed and took Li Cangyu to the living room. He brought over a plate of fruit and asked, \u201cDo you want to eat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t eat, I\u2019m full.\u201d Li Cangyu just ate a lot of food and more than half the fish. He touched his belly and sat on the sofa to accompany Uncle Ling in watching TV.</p><br/><p>Ling Boyan was watching a basketball game. Li Cangyu actively brought up the topic. \u201cUncle, do you like to watch basketball games?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich team do you like?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a favourite. I just watch casually when I have time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled. \u201cI am the same. I haven\u2019t been closely following this season\u2019s NBA games. I always miss the live matches and will sometimes watch the replays. I particularly like to play basketball.\u201d Ling Boyan looked at him. \u201cYou can play? How about playing a match one day?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there a basketball at home?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we play tomorrow?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu\u2019s cheerful and straightforward personality was easy to please the elders. He and Father Ling talked happily, the always serious Father Ling showing a rare smile.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng sat next to them but was more like a guest of this family.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>In fact, Ling Xuefeng\u2019s parents knew about Li Cangyu\u2019s existence a long time ago.</p><br/><p>It was the year that Li Cangyu led his team to leave Miracle. In order to persuade him to stay, Ling Xuefeng bought an expensive ticket and went all the way to New York. At that time, Ling Boyan and Yuan Xin had come to Shanghai to visit him at the club. They found it empty and learnt that their son had flown to New York to find someone. The two of them returned home in a confused manner.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng hated lying. After returning home, he simply confessed to his parents that he liked this person.</p><br/><p>His parents naturally couldn\u2019t accept it and Ling Boyan almost beat him up.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng talked to his parents for a long time before they realized that liking the same sex wasn\u2019t a disease and many countries had actually passed the same-sex marriage law.</p><br/><p>As long as two people loved each other, they could grow old together, even if they were the same gender. On the other hand, the marriages without love between a man and woman could end up in divorce despite being together for many years and having children.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng\u2019s father, Ling Boyan was a businessman. He travelled a lot and was well-informed in the last few years. He was sad about his son\u2019s love of men but Ling Xuefeng was determined from an early age. As long as he made up his mind, he wouldn\u2019t regret it, even if his head ended up bleeding.</p><br/><p>Ling Boyan knew that his son wouldn\u2019t change. He could only hope that his son would calm down as time passed. But after so many years, Ling Xuefeng still stubbornly liked that person.</p><br/><p>Ling Boyan helplessly adopted the \u2018Do whatever you want. I am too lazy to care about you\u2019 attitude.</p><br/><p>Yuan Xin was a gentle housewife but she felt distressed for her son. She saw that Ling Xuefeng liked this person so much and gradually accepted it, hoping her son could be sincere. He should chase after the person called Li Cangyu and take him home to show them one day.</p><br/><p>As a result, this day really arrived.</p><br/><p>Yuan Xin received a text message from her son this morning, stating that he was bringing someone home. She was so excited that she shed tears and immediately went to the nearby supermarket to buy many ingredients. She wanted to cook a table full of delicious food because she was afraid to be rude to Li Cangyu.</p><br/><p>She treated Li Cangyu as a VIP.</p><br/><p>As a mother, she hoped that the person her son liked could be good for her son. The male or female aspect was no longer so important. It was fine since her son liked this person.</p><br/><p>Ling Boyan wasn\u2019t as excited as Yuan Xin and he looked at the person his son brought with questioning eyes. However, Li Cangyu gave a good first impression, not the feminine type that Ling Boyan expected. He was very sunny, handsome and was as good as their son.</p><br/><p>The last layer of concern in their hearts were dispelled and Ling Boyan\u2019s attitude towards Li Cangyu was a lot softer.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu originally came to Ling Xuefeng\u2019s house to please his future parents-in-laws. The result was that Father Ling and Mother Ling already knew about his existence and had a look of \u2018watching the daughter-in-law\u2019. They evaluated him and were very satisfied. He already got the elders\u2019 approval without knowing.</p><br/><p>That evening, the unwitting Li Cangyu took the initiative to set up the massage foot bath that he bought, explaining to Ling Boyan, \u201cUncle, this massage basin is very easy to use. It automatically heats the water and the intensity of the massage can be adjusted. The disinfection function also means that two people can use it with no problems. You and auntie should use this to wash and massage your feet before going to sleep. It will make your sleep better!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, thank you.\u201d Ling Boyan received the gift and felt very appreciative of this young man who knew how to be filial to his elders.</p><br/><p>Then Li Cangyu gave a set of valuable jewelry to Yuan Xin. Yuan Xin tried it on and Li Cangyu spoke seriously, \u201cAuntie, you are beautiful when wearing this. You look really young!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yuan Xin smiled and looked at herself in the mirror while praising Li Cangyu. \u201cOur Xiao Li is sensible. My Xuefeng never bought me things like this. He probably thinks his mother is old.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu is your son isn\u2019t he? Did you get bought by the gift?</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way, I have something for you.\u201d Yuan Xin went to her bedroom and grabbed a box. \u201cThis is the first time you came to our house and you brought us so many gifts. Auntie didn\u2019t prepare anything so I\u2019ll just give you this.</p><br/><p>She placed the delicate box in Li Cangyu\u2019s hands as she spoke.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu opened it and saw a piece of jade inside. Although he lacked knowledge about jade, the jade was warm and smooth in his hand. It was crystal clear under the light. At first glance, it was a valuable jade attached to a simple red rope, meaning it could be worn as a necklace. It was simple and stylish, making it suitable for both men and women.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was surprised. \u201cAuntie, this is too expensive\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yuan Xin smiled. \u201cIt isn\u2019t expensive. It contains a bit of my heart. Accept it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu wanted to refuse but Ling Xuefeng said calmly, \u201cSince my mother is giving it to you, take it.\u201d</p><br/><p>He placed the piece of jade into Li Cangyu\u2019s pocket as he spoke. Li Cangyu smiled brightly. \u201cThank you, Auntie.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yuan Xin replied happily, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome! This is a talisman that can bring good luck. You should wear it often in the future!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I will wear it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu placed the jade around his neck, thinking it was just an ordinary jade necklace.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng didn\u2019t have time to tell him that this was the jade that his mother bought him when he was born. He wore it for a while when he was a child. Later, he didn\u2019t want to wear it and his mother said, \u201cThen Mother will help you store it. Give it to your wife when you grow up.\u201d</p><br/><p>She gave the jade to Li Cangyu, showing that she approved of the man her son brought home.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu didn\u2019t know and put on the jade, taking the initiative to wear the mark of the Ling family.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng smiled slightly and gently placed an arm around his mother\u2019s shoulders. \u201cThank you Mom.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yuan Xin smiled but her eyes were shining with tears. \u2018What thanks? As long as you are happy, Mother is very content!\u2019</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The power was amazing and all opponents were disabled in one breath, causing the domestic audience feel excited. The live broadcast room was filled with \u2018666\u2019 and Kou Hongyi spoke excitedly, \u201cThe lineup of three summoners is really strong. They broke out at the same time and directly wiped out 90% of the opponents\u2019 blood!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Bing also calmed down and carefully analyzed, \u201cIn principle, the three summoners have both control and outbreak. The combination is really strong but there are preconditions. The three people must have enough understanding since their summoned pets can easily influence each other. If the location where the pets are summoned isn\u2019t good, it will block the eyes of the teammates and become a liability.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kou Hongyi agreed. \u201cThere are so many pets that it can become chaotic! Today this lineup could be seen in the World Competition but I don\u2019t think any team in the domestic Miracle League can come up with it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Bing glanced at the big screen where the score had become 2:1. She confidently said, \u201cThe national team\u2019s captain and vice-captain have pulled together the third game. The fourth game is the Chinese team\u2019s home advantage and they can certainly hold it!\u201d</p><br/><p>At present, the US team lost the third game but they still had the big advantage of two points. The next game was still their match point. If the next game was won, the US team could win the championships with a score of 3:1.</p><br/><p>Thus, the fourth game was crucial!</p><br/><p>If the Chinese team could withstand the pressure in the fourth game, the score would be equalized and the two sides would enter the final decisive stage. On the contrary, if the Chinese team lost in the fourth game, all efforts in the previous period would be wasted.</p><br/><p>Both Li Cangyu and Ling Xuefeng had played the last game and the players who would be sent in the fourth game became the focus of the domestic audience.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu returned to the rest of the team and they took the initiative to clap. Su Guangmo smiled boldly, \u201cThree summoners are terrible. We should be glad that Cat God and Captain Ling aren\u2019t teammates!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian joked, \u201cIf Cat God teams up with Captain Ling, should we join the rest of the teams?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui raised his hand in agreement. \u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRest assured, we will only be opponents in the domestic league. Right, Xuefeng?\u201d Li Cangyu glanced over at Ling Xuefeng and happened to see his smile. The two people smiled at each other and Ling Xuefeng patted Li Cangyu\u2019s shoulder. Then he raised a serious topic, \u201cWho will be going in the fourth round?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu stopped smiling and replied, \u201cThe fourth game is our home game and there is no doubt that the map will be the Eight-Trigram Array. The key is who will be the commander\u2026\u201d After a moment of thought, Li Cangyu stated, \u201cCaptain Lou.\u201d</p><br/><p>The cold-looking man immediately stood up. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled and said, \u201cYou will be the commander.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang didn\u2019t hesitate and simply nodded. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><br/><p>His personality had always been like this and his way of speaking was often concise. His expression was cold and he never laughed when others were joking. He had an indifferent attitude whenever encountering anything.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu felt that at the crucial moment, only Lou Wushuang could turn the tide.</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo was fierce and violent while Tan Shitian was resourceful. These two people could serve as commanders in key games but their tactical style wasn\u2019t suitable for the Eight-Trigram Array map. Meanwhile, Lou Wushuang\u2019s assassination could play an effect in the maze.</p><br/><p>Captain Lou was named and Zhang Shaohui consciously ran to his brother\u2019s side and smiled at Li Cangyu. \u201cCat God, since my brother is the commander, I\u2019m also playing right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Lou Zhang combination couldn\u2019t be torn down, especially in a key match. The tacit understanding between the two brothers would be a weapon to attack the US team. As for the remaining candidates, Li Cangyu pondered for a moment before finally naming, \u201cChu Yan, Zhu Qingyue, Yu Pingsheng, you three go.\u201d</p><br/><p>The lineup for the fourth game was completed. Chu Yan and Zhu Qingyue\u2019s psychics, the Lou Zhang assassins and then the berserker Yu Pingsheng who was very strong in defense.</p><br/><p>The concept of the Eight-Trigram Array map was originally proposed by Chu Yan and he was the best psychic auxiliary in the country. He was sensitive to various stats and once accompanied by his apprentice, he could use the map against the US team.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu laid out the lineup and then patted Lou Wushuang on the shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll leave it to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>These words were simply but were actually incredibly heavy. This game couldn\u2019t be lost or their previous efforts would be undone. The pressure on Lou Wushuang\u2019s shoulder definitely wasn\u2019t lower than Li Cangyu in the previous game.</p><br/><p>In fact, Lou Wushuang and Li Cangyu were the same type of people. This was why Li Cangyu chose him at the key point.</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo, Xie Shurong, Cheng Wei and the others debuted at the same time but Lou Wushuang was two years behind them.</p><br/><p>During the time when Su Guangmo led the Flying Feathers team to win the championship, when Cheng Wei won the Best Newcomer Award and when the rookie Tan Shitian debuted and led the Time team to the top of the league, Lou Wushuang was still unknown.</p><br/><p>The Ghost Spirits team made a late effort and won the championship in the fifth season. Every step of the Lou Zhang combination was very solid.</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang\u2019s heart was definitely the most tenacious among the young captains.</p><br/><p>He led the Ghost Spirits team step by step to today, from an invisible person to the first assassin of the league. He had long been accustomed to a variety of headwinds and developed. Regardless of any disadvantages, he could calmly deal with it with a tough mentality.</p><br/><p>At the crucial moment, Li Cangyu sent him as the commander, showing Li Cangyu\u2019s appreciation and trust in him.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang didn\u2019t say much. After taking on the command, he sat quietly in his seat and continued to wait.</p><br/><p>After the intermission, Li Cangyu and Noah went back to the computer. The fourth game was the Chinese team\u2019s home game and Li Cangyu resolutely submitted the game mode, death racing.</p><br/><p>This choice was expected by many viewers. Death racing reflected the advantages of the home court more than an economic war and it wasn\u2019t as easy to be targeted as the arena.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu followed up by submitting the maps: Suzhou Gardens, Eight-Trigram Array and Dark Reef.</p><br/><p>The US team\u2019s captain, Noah couldn\u2019t help frowning. In the last game, he forced Li Cangyu to choose Universal Studios. In this game, Li Cangyu forced him to choose the Eight-Trigram Array.</p><br/><p>According to the principle of \u2018a map that has been disabled once can\u2019t be disabled again\u2019, he disabled the Eight-Trigram Array map in the second game and could no longer disable it.</p><br/><p>Noah reluctantly banned Suzhou Gardens and Dark Reef, leaving behind Eight-Trigram Array. The audience was excited since the Eight-Trigram Array was finally used, The efforts of the Chinese team\u2019s designers wouldn\u2019t be wasted!</p><br/><p>Looking at the thumbnail, the map was a circular icon that was rich in colour. At first glance, it looked like a maze. However, the domestic audience members had often encountered the five elements and they started to recall their tragic experiences. Many people said that this map would pit foreigners.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu saw the other side selecting the map and then submitted the list of players\u2014 Lou Wushuang, Zhang Shaohui, Chu Yan, Zhu Qingyue and Yu Pingsheng.</p><br/><p>This lineup had never appeared before. Yu Bing said, \u201cAccording to the lineup, this map is likely to have status effects or traps. The role of the two psychics is displacement control while the berserker will protect the teammates. Lou Zhang is responsible for the output.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kou Hongyi said, \u201cThe US team can send people afterwards and can target our lineup. However, our lineup doesn\u2019t have any obvious weakness. Noah should send more pressure-resistant classes to prevent the instant kill of the double assassins.\u201d</p><br/><p>He just finished speaking when Noah submitted his lineup\u2014 the paladin Barrett, the berserker Madison, the healer Winfrey, the archer Aldridge and the black magician Daisy.</p><br/><p>There were a paladin, berserker and healer, which was a very pressure resistant lineup.</p><br/><p>It was the most sensible thing to send a strong defense when the enemy map was unclear.</p><br/><p>The captains of both sides finished their selection and it was time for the map preview.</p><br/><p>The panoramic map of the Eight-Trigram Array started to play on the big screen and the American players collectively showed blank expressions.</p><br/><p>What the hell was this?</p><br/><p>The map was divided into five small squares of gold, green, blue, red and brown. The middle of the small square was a white area which was obviously a labyrinth with a complicated route. The five-coloured area had entrances to the labyrinth and the five roads eventually lead to the middle disc.</p><br/><p>The puzzling thing was that the five colour blocks weren\u2019t static but rotated clockwise every 30 seconds.</p><br/><p>Winfrey looked at the captain with confusion. \u201cThe white area is obviously a maze but what are the rotating colour blocks?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand it either.\u201d Noah rubbed his temples to ease his headache. \u201cIt\u2019s more complicated than our Universal Studios.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thomas was straightforward. \u201cThe colours of this map is very beautiful. Did they make so many coloured areas for colour matching? The colour blocks will turn, just like the turntable used in the raffle!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jack stared blankly at him and stated, \u201cThe coloured areas are likely to be traps.\u201d</p><br/><p>Noah felt it was reasonable and stared at the map for a moment before making an accurate judgment. \u201cTraps will be marked and these coloured areas obviously have no traps. However, the Chinese team wouldn\u2019t divide the map into five colours for the sake of looks. The different colours must have different meanings.\u201d Noah paused and continuing, \u201cIf my guess is correct, this should be a status map.\u201d</p><br/><p>The captain\u2019s words woke them up and everyone stared at the big screen, not daring to miss a single detail.</p><br/><p>A status map with five colours, meaning there should be five different effects. This was much more complicated than Universal Studios!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He closed the suitcase and said with a smile, \u201cI have spend so many years tapping on the keyboard, I really don\u2019t want to continue.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this your true heart?\u201d Li Cangyu stared at him. \u201cWe have been partners for so many years. Do you think I would believe this lie?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan uneasily removed his gaze.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you to go the hospital a few days ago?\u201d Li Cangyu asked directly.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Bai Xuan was silent.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu saw that his face was pale and asked softly, \u201cWhat happened? If you are having problems, tell me and maybe I can help you find a solution?\u201d</p><br/><p>Facing Li Cangyu\u2019s eyes filled with concern, Bai Xuan finally sighed reluctantly. He smiled bitterly and said, \u201cI really can\u2019t deceive you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He turned and found a file in his suitcase, handing it over to the other person. \u201cThis is the doctor\u2019s diagnosis report. In fact, it isn\u2019t that I don\u2019t want to play but\u2026 My health is getting worse and I\u2019m not fit to play anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>The diagnosis report read: Multiple ulcers in the upper part of the stomach and the duodenum.</p><br/><p>Stomach ulcers weren\u2019t the same as liver cancer or lung cancer, which would make people feel desperate. However, this chronic disease that humans suffered was enough to make people miserable.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan\u2019s spirit during this time was very bad and he also ate very little during meals. Li Cangyu thought he had been too stressed from the game. Now it seemed that he actually had a serious stomach disease and was eating and sleeping badly. Therefore, he was pale and weak.</p><br/><p>In this state, there was no way for Bai Xuan to continue playing and he obliged to leave.</p><br/><p>He felt reluctant but an e-sports player who couldn\u2019t stay highly concentrated would be slaughtered on the arena and frag down his teammates.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan had his own pride and didn\u2019t want to be a burden to his teammates.</p><br/><p>He saw Li Cangyu\u2019s frowning expression and smiled, taking back the report. \u201cIn fact, the symptoms aren\u2019t serious. The doctor says that I need to pay attention to diet and sleep, then I will slowly get better\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>His words hadn\u2019t finished when he was suddenly pulled into a warm embrace.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu\u2019s hug was very tight. He couldn\u2019t say anything good to comfort his friend so he could only express his feelings with a silent hug.</p><br/><p>When the FTD team was created, he and Bai Xuan were both 18 years old. Bai Xuan was good at English and thought about using FTD as a acronym for \u2018For the Dream.\u2019 After FTD was disbanded due to poor results and the two people transferred together, Bai Xuan was the one who thought of the name Canglan\u2014it was cold and piercing, magnificent enough to reflect their ambition and heart.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan had stayed by Li Cangyu\u2019s side as the vice-captain and was like Li Cangyu\u2019s right arm. He always helped Li Cangyu handle the team\u2019s internal affairs at the appropriate time.</p><br/><p>This man seemed gentle but he had his own dreams and dignity.</p><br/><p>He was the best healer, the best vice-captain and Li Cangyu\u2019s most trusted partner.</p><br/><p>Since he chose to leave with dignity, Li Cangyu couldn\u2019t detain him. Li Cangyu could only hug him tightly and whisper, \u201cTake care.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan smiled and nodded. \u201cYou too.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>That evening, Li Cangyu took a shower and immediately sat in front of the computer writing a long e-mail that detailed Bai Xuan\u2019s situation. He soon received a reply to his e-mail, the contents saying simply: Bring your friend over, I will examine him.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu bought a ticket to fly to New York and it was the same flight as Bai Xuan.</p><br/><p>Once Bai Xuan saw an old friend at the airport security checkpoint, his eyes widened with amazement. \u201cHow are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu\u2019s expression was calm. \u201cI contacted a doctor in New York for you and will accompany you to the check-up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan looked at him emotionally. Helping a friend to this extent, Li Cangyu\u2019s degree of loyalty really made people speechless!</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu patted Bai Xuan\u2019s shoulder with a smile. \u201cLet\u2019s go. Going abroad can distract us and we can also look at your stomach.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two men boarded a flight to New York, USA. After arriving at the airport in New York, a woman with big curly hair rushed over after seeing the two of them and hugged Li Cangyu tightly.</p><br/><p>The woman was very beautiful and her black curly hair was very eye-catching. Li Cangyu took the initiative to introduce her. \u201cThis is my older sister, Li Yueran.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is nice to meet you.\u201d Bai Xuan politely greeted her.</p><br/><p>Li Yueran shook hands with Bai Xuan and said cheerfully, \u201cLet\u2019s go, I have arranged accommodations for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan\u2019s trip to New York was for the sake of travel and he hadn\u2019t expected Li Cangyu to have relatives here. His sister directly let them stay at her house, which was very clean. The bed sheets in the two bedrooms were visibly new, showing that Li Cangyu\u2019s sister was very reliable.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will take you out for dinner tonight to welcome you. Starting from tomorrow, I have no time to welcome you so you will have to entertain Bai Xuan.\u201d Li Yueran told her younger brother, \u201cYour brother-in-law is on a business trip. The house is empty so both of you can live casually. You aren\u2019t a stranger to New York. If you have any problems, you can call me. I am working in the hospital this year and will return home at most once a week.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Li Cangyu replied simply. \u201cYou are busy so you don\u2019t have to care about me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan heard this and couldn\u2019t help feeling curious. \u201cBig sister, are you a doctor?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yueran laughed and replied, \u201cYes, my father is also a doctor.\u201d</p><br/><p>The team usually never talked about family so this was the first time Bai Xuan knew that Li Cangyu\u2019s father and sister were doctors. He didn\u2019t expect Li Cangyu to actually come from a medical family.</p><br/><p>The next day, Li Cangyu took Bai Xuan to the hospital to find his father.</p><br/><p>Professor Li Jianan was an expert in digestive medicine. The middle-aged man in his 50s looked quite similar to Li Cangyu but his face was very serious. His expression didn\u2019t change at all after seeing his son. He just picked up Bai Xuan\u2019s medical record and studied it carefully.</p><br/><p>After reading Bai Xuan\u2019s medical records and examination reports, he carefully took a basic medical examination. Then he wrote on a piece of paper and said, \u201cGo for a gastroscopy and I will tell you the results later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu stood outside and couldn\u2019t help feeling distressed when he saw the pale Bai Xuan lying there and frowning in pain.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan must\u2019ve been too worried about the team\u2019s affairs and didn\u2019t take time to go to the hospital for a good checkup. In addition, e-sports players often flew around to play games in various places. The diet, work schedule and rest were very irregular, causing his stomach disease to become more and more serious.</p><br/><p>In the past two years, Bai Xuan had lost weight. This guy seemed to have a gentle temper but he was actually very stubborn. The two unfortunate people had worked together for many years and only got stomach ulcers, not a trophy. They were really the saddest partners in the competitive e-sports circle.</p><br/><p>After finishing the gastroscope, Bai Xuan\u2019s face was still very pale. Li Cangyu quickly held him and whispered, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019m okay. Let\u2019s take the results to your father.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two people returned to the doctor\u2019s office, where Li Jianan looked at the results and explained, \u201cThis level doesn\u2019t require surgery. You just need to rest and slowly recover. To prevent stomach bleeding, I will give you some drugs that will protect the gastric mucosa. You must pay attention to your diet and not eat any spicy or stimulating things. The meals should be light and they should be a regular three meals a day. Don\u2019t stay up late and get adequate sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Bai Xuan listened and nodded seriously. \u201cThank you uncle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Jianan gave the list to Bai Xuan and looked at the two people. \u201cDon\u2019t think you can act freely at your age. Take the medicine or your body will regret it!\u201d</p><br/><p>He was obviously speaking to Bai Xuan and his son at the same time. Bai Xuan looked at Li Cangyu slyly while the other was calm and had a \u2018not my business\u2019 attitude.</p><br/><p>Father Li couldn\u2019t bear it and called out directly, \u201cLi Cangyu, I\u2019m talking about you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Li Cangyu nodded and said seriously, \u201cMy health is very good and I can play for a few more years. Rest assured Dad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Li Jianan was so angry at his son that he got chest pains. Then he waved his hand and said, \u201cGet lost. In any case, I can\u2019t control you after you turned 18 years old.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu said with a smile, \u201cThank you Dad! I\u2019m going on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wouldn\u2019t this make his father angrier?</p><br/><p>It was fan to see how this father and son didn\u2019t get along on the surface, always bickering, but they were actually quite concerned about one another. When Li Cangyu came here, he bought a lot of gifts for his dad that he handed over to his eldest sister.</p><br/><p>They left the hospital and Li Cangyu repeated his father\u2019s words. \u201cDo you remember to pay attention to your diet and get enough sleep?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan felt like laughing and crying. \u201cI remember!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Li Cangyu nodded with satisfaction. \u201cWhere do you want to go? I\u2019ll go with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to wander around. Let\u2019s go home for dinner first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan needed an empty stomach for his hospital examination. The moment Li Cangyu thought this, he immediately took Bai Xuan home.</p><br/><p>On the way back, he saw a store selling a variety of games. Li Cangyu couldn\u2019t help stopping at the counter and said to the salesperson, \u201cHello, please give me a Miracle card.\u201d</p><br/><p>The voice was very good, causing the salesperson to look up. The smiling person had neat white teeth and gave off a sunny and handsome appearance.</p><br/><p>The people who came here to buy things were usually otakus with some acne, this type of handsome person was very rare.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour card contains 300 hours of game time.\u201d The shopkeeper became enthusiastic. \u201cIs there anything else for this handsome man?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d Li Cangyu paid the money, took the card and turned away.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cWhy are you buying a Miracle card? Aren\u2019t you going to the Dragon Warriors team?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI talked to Liu Chuan and he wants to expand the Dragon Warriors club into the Miracle Professional League. This time I took the initiative to find him and he allowed me to be the captain in charge of this matter.\u201d Li Cangyu explained while studying the pattern on the card in his hand. \u201cI\u2019m going to build a new team to return to the Miracle Alliance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Bai Xuan frowned. \u201cWon\u2019t you feel very tired building a new team again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t this his third team?</p><br/><p>In addition, the last time he had the vice-captain and other teammates. This time he was alone!</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled. \u201cI don\u2019t feel tired. I have been thinking about returning to Miracle for the past two years, so this is a good opportunity for me.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Bai Xuan looked at him helplessly. Once this man had decided something, eight horses couldn\u2019t pull him back. He had clearly made up his mind to recreate a team in Miracle and no one could shake this determination.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go to the bathroom first. Wait for me here.\u201d Li Cangyu rushed away.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan looked thoughtfully at this man\u2019s back before suddenly turning around and returning to the store.</p><br/><p>As the shopkeeper looked at him with puzzled eyes, Bai Xuan politely smiled and said, \u201cPlease give me a Miracle card as well, thank you.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Li Cangyu noticed this and didn\u2019t hesitate to summon the guardian.</p><br/><p>However, Lou Wushuang was very calm and he didn\u2019t use the strongest attack skill to deal with Li Cangyu. He only used an assassination skill that consumed a low amount of blue and it was successfully blocked by the guard.</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang immediately transferred targets and directly killed Li Cangyu\u2019s guardian.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu summoned the fire spirit to deal with him and Lou Wushuang decisively killed Li Cangyu\u2019s fire spirit.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu admired this. He saw that Lou Wushuang\u2019s IQ was extremely high and his playing style was quite smart. He dropped two of Li Cangyu\u2019s pets in a row and then counted the cooldown time of the other pets. This made it difficult for Li Cangyu to use pets to control his opponent. Instead, he would fall into the danger of having no pets available.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu naturally couldn\u2019t let himself fall into such a disadvantage. He noticed something was wrong and immediately used Flying Feather Steps to run. Cat God\u2019s escape technique was particularly skillful.</p><br/><p>His 40% blood meant he would undoubtedly lose to Lou Wushuang and Bai Xuan but Li Cangyu still refused to die. He used Flying Feather Steps to consume a lot of Lou Wushuang\u2019s skills before finally falling under his dagger.</p><br/><p>The Frost Team sent the second group of partners, Zhang Shaohui and Chu Yan.</p><br/><p>Many Ghost Spirits fans were excited when they saw this. The Lou Zhang brothers had grown up together and were cousins. They were usually inseparable in the team and cooperated with the best understanding. They were repeatedly nominated for the best partners aware and led the Ghost Spirits team to successfully win the championship.</p><br/><p>Since their debut, the two of them had always appeared in the form of a combination. Zhang Shaohui had to protect his brother no matter what. In a post-match interview, a reporter once said that if Lou Wushuang was in front, Zhang Shaohui would be behind him. The vice-captain\u2019s protection of his brother was notorious in the league.</p><br/><p>The two brothers were actually facing each other in the arena today. It was enough to make the audience members feel excited.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui couldn\u2019t help feeling dazed when he saw Lou Wushuang. His brother was smart and rational. Sometimes he was so calm he was like a cold-blooded animal.</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui was first discovered by the captain of Ghost Spirits because of his excellent game talent. At that time, Lou Wushuang was still ignorant of Miracle. Then in less than a year, Lou Wushuang caught up to Zhang Shaohui and even surpassed him.</p><br/><p>This time, Zhang Shaohui didn\u2019t have much confidence facing his brother in the arena!</p><br/><p>Even so, he couldn\u2019t just admit defeat.</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui immediately entered stealth and lurked behind Bai Xuan, trying to use Chu Yan\u2019s help to kill the milk dad Bai Xuan.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan\u2019s alertness was very strong. As Zhang Shaohui moved around, Bai Xuan was also jumping around. This meant Zhang Shaohui couldn\u2019t accurately locate him and ended up being behind Lou Wushuang.</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang asked: [What are you doing behind my back? You aren\u2019t coming out?]</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui was embarrassed. [\u2026Did you guess?]</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang was a bit speechless. This idiot, they had been together for so long that it was impossible not to guess. He must\u2019ve unsuccessfully tried to assassinate Vice-Captain Bai and then ended up lurking behind Lou Wushuang.</p><br/><p>Obviously lurking but not acting, wasn\u2019t this showing heart to his brother?</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang\u2019s indifferent eyes softened at this thought and he directly lurked behind Chu Yan to deal with Chu Yan.</p><br/><p>The brothers asked each other a question and then left each other. The Ghost Spirits fans were a bit dull. [Aren\u2019t they fighting?] [Captain Lou and Vice-Captain Zhang don\u2019t seem used to being opponents.] [Vice-Captain Zhang still has a bit of conscience, unlike Vice-Captain Cheng who went hard against Captain Tan!] [This is why brothers are brothers!] [You forgot, Vice-Captain Zhang said that when they registered, they agreed that they should always be good partners and never aim blades at each other.]</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui was really in a daze because Lou Wushuang\u2019s ID of Vestige always accompanied him for a full five years. He was used to seeing this blood kin assassin as his own person.</p><br/><p>On the field, he always cooperated with Lou Wushuang to protect each other and kill the enemy. Suddenly, Vestige became an opponent and Zhang Shaohui couldn\u2019t respond.</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang also didn\u2019t attack him. For these brothers, the names Vestige and Shadow had a special meaning when they were registered together. At the time, they agreed to never aim blades at each other and would consciously open side accounts when training with the team. The pair of assassins who accompanied each other for five years didn\u2019t want to aim at each other today.</p><br/><p>However, since they met in the ring, they couldn\u2019t stand in place as soy sauce.</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui turned to kill Bai Xuan and Lou Wushuang to kill Chu Yan. The survival ability of Bai Xuan\u2019s healer and Chu Yan\u2019s auxiliary was extremely high and it was hard to chase them on this map. The result was 10 minutes passed without anyone dying.</p><br/><p>Once the battle continued to 12 minutes and Bai Xuan still had half blood left, Zhang Shaohui couldn\u2019t bear it anymore and made a suggestion. [Why don\u2019t we all go down and let the third group play?]</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang agreed. [Yes.]</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui: [Brother, you jump into the sea first?]</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang: [You first.]</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui smiled. [Don\u2019t lie to me.]</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan suggested: [Or perhaps Vice-Captain Chu should jump first.]</p><br/><p>Chu Yan asked: [Am I stupid? What if you don\u2019t die after I jump?]</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan smiled. [I will keep my word. You kill yourself and I will kill myself.]</p><br/><p>Chu Yan: [Then you jump first.]</p><br/><p>The audience, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>There was laughter at the venue. How did things end up like this? This was the arena and they were big gods. Yet the big gods were discussing about who would jump in first?</p><br/><p>However, there was no other way. Lou Wushuang and Zhang Shaohui had an agreement since they were young that Vestige and Shadow would never oppose each other. This was known to fans. The two brothers wouldn\u2019t take the initiative to kill each other.</p><br/><p>The two outputs didn\u2019t do their best and the healer couldn\u2019t die. It was estimated that this match would last until dinner so it was better to finish it quickly for the next group.</p><br/><p>In the end, the oldest Chu Yan said, \u201cLet\u2019s look at the time bar and jump when it is 15 minutes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other three people agreed.</p><br/><p>The time bar quickly reached 15 minutes and the four people jumped into the sea, directly ending the second stage.</p><br/><p>The audience, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>These guys were so funny! The second stage of the arena turned into a suicide discussion and everyone could only wait for the third stage to restore the atmosphere.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The third stage was the Fire Team\u2019s Su Yu against the Frost Team\u2019s Ling Liu combination. In fact, Li Cangyu saw this combination and thought the Frost Team would lose.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t because Ling Xuefeng and Liu Xiang\u2019s level weren\u2019t as good. It was because the frequency of Liu Xiang adding blood was different to Ling Xuefeng\u2019s attack frequency. After all, the two people weren\u2019t teammates and were hastily put together. They couldn\u2019t compare to the Flying Feathers team\u2019s ace combination.</p><br/><p>The facts proved it. Su Guangmo and Yu Pingsheng used the violence of the two melee classes to take away the healer Liu Xiang. Then it was 2v1 and Ling Xuefeng found it difficult to fight.</p><br/><p>The moment Yu Pingsheng made him dizzy with the axe, Ling Xuefeng couldn\u2019t help thinking, \u2018The two of you can be arrogant now. One day I will go out with my Cat and abuse you.\u2019</p><br/><p>The Su Yu pair didn\u2019t know Captain Ling\u2019s thoughts and happily killed Captain Ling.</p><br/><p>The host announced, \u201cThe Fire Team has won the third game! Today\u2019s Carnival score is 2:1 with the Fire Team as the victor. The losing team will provide three signature prizes to the audience. They have to also select a person to accept the punishment of the other team! You can discuss who will accept the punishment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu didn\u2019t hesitate to point at Cheng Wei. \u201cCheng Wei will take it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei was stunned. \u2018Idol, did you just sell me? I\u2019m going to become a black fan!\u2019</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled and patted him on the shoulder. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><br/><p>The others were in favour of letting Cheng Wei be punished and Cheng Wei had to go to the centre of the stage with his head bowed.</p><br/><p>The Fire Team unanimously agreed to let Tan Shitian set the punishment. Tan Shitian came forward and the audience thought that Tan Shitian would be evil to Cheng Wei. The result was that Tan Shitian just smiled and said, \u201cYou always dislike it when I touch your head. I will give you a chance to touch my head today.\u201d</p><br/><p>The audience, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What type of punishment was this? Captain Tan was too much!</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei made a disbelieving expression and cried out when he saw that Tan Shitian wasn\u2019t joking, \u201cDon\u2019t regret it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he reached out to touch Tan Shitian\u2019s head. The result was that he was too short and couldn\u2019t touch it\u2026</p><br/><p>He reached out again and still couldn\u2019t touch\u2026</p><br/><p>The audience just realized that their height difference was so big. Wasn\u2019t Tan Shitian blatantly mocking Cheng Wei? Look at Cheng Wei\u2019s flushed face.</p><br/><p>After trying to touch it a few times, Cheng Wei saw the audience laughing and immediately retracted his hand with a red face. \u201cChange the punishment. What punishment is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian looked at him tenderly. \u201cI see\u2026 what about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Captain Tan slightly bent over so that Cheng Wei could reach out and touch his head. Cheng Wei angrily rubbed his head and unexpectedly found that it felt good!</p><br/><p>The audience was speechless. \u2018Captain Tan, are you punishing Cheng Wei or yourself?\u2019 Captain Tan was really soft. Cheng Wei beat him so hard in the game but he let Cheng Wei go in the punishment stage.</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei also knew this and indescribable feelings burst in his heart as he looked at the man who took the initiative to bend down in front of him. He couldn\u2019t help reaching out to organize Tan Shitian\u2019s messy hair.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

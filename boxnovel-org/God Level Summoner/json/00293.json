Ling Xuefeng won the super god achievement by killing eight people and became the world\u2019s first player to gain this achievement!</p><br/><p>This news set off an uproar in the domestic e-sports circle.</p><br/><p>All domestic e-sports sites scrambled to report the good news. The comments for the Miracle League\u2019s official Weibo post broke through seven figures in an instant while other countries\u2019 e-sports reporters expressed surprised at the Chinese team\u2019s record. They defeated Australia and then Spain with a score of 3:0 and the Chinese team seemed to have an unstoppable momentum in the World Competition.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu\u2019s three kills in the arena and Ling Xuefeng\u2019s super god in death racing announced to the world\u2019s MIracle fans that the Chinese team was strong!</p><br/><p>The Spanish captain Rodriguez stated in an interview after the game, \u201cThe captain of the Chinese team is a very resourceful player. In addition, I advise the captains of other countries to try and ban the Chinese team\u2019s maps or they will definitely suffer!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was obvious that Rodriguez had a psychological shadow regarding Mount Huangshan Plank Road.</p><br/><p>The Spanish vice-captain Sobrino told the reporters, \u201cMany players on the Chines team haven\u2019t appeared in the world rankings but their strength is world-class. We were too careless\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Spain had lost two games and were destined to miss out on the quarter-finals. Their emotions weren\u2019t great and after the interview, they returned to the Miracle Village in advance.</p><br/><p>Next was the interview with the winners, the Chinese team.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu wanted to bring Jiang Xu but Jiang Xu didn\u2019t want to appear in front of the reporters. He always kept a low profile and declined to attend the interview. Other players also said they didn\u2019t want to accept the baptism of camera flashes and Li Cangyu was forced to appear with Ling Xuefeng.</p><br/><p>As soon as the captain and vice-captain of the national team appeared, they received warm applause from e-sports reporters from all over the world!</p><br/><p>The two people were equally tall and handsome. Ling Xuefeng looked cold while Li Cangyu smiled brightly. He was obviously in a very good mood.</p><br/><p>The reporters instantly handed the microphone over to Li Cangyu. \u201cCat God, your three kills were really handsome!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu nodded to the reporter. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to ask, who arranges the tactics for every match?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu glanced at the man next to him and smiled. \u201cI usually discuss it with Xuefeng.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng didn\u2019t speak but he looked at Li Cangyu and nodded in agreement.</p><br/><p>The reporter asked curiously, \u201cHow are the overall tactics formulated?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu patiently explained, \u201cWe will set the core tactics and corresponding commander in response to the characteristics of players from different countries. For example, in the previous match against Australia, I decided to let Tan Shitian take charge of the economic warfare after discussing it with Xuefeng while Su Guangmo was responsible for death racing. In this match against Spain, Jiang Xu was responsible for the economic battle while Xuefeng was responsible for death racing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEvery person is responsible for a different style. For example, Tan Shitian\u2019s kite flow can deal with the Australian lineup. In order to avoid out tactics being guessed early on by Spain, I let Jiang Xu use the double taunting method.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter setting the core tactics and corresponding commander, we let the commander personally select the teammates. There will be six people for the economic war and five people for death racing. Then I will arrange the arena combinations from the remaining people.\u201d</p><br/><p>A reporter couldn\u2019t help being surprised after hearing this. \u201cThe commander of the economic battle was Jiang Xu?\u201d Obviously, people who didn\u2019t know much about tactics misunderstood that the commander was Tan Shitian.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu felt it was necessary to give credit to Jiang Xu. \u201cIt is truly Captain Jiang. Tan Shitian and Liu Xiang fit his style of play and the national team doesn\u2019t have many hunters. We can use the pure trap flow so Jiang Xu proposed the double taunting idea. The effect worked better than we thought.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters suddenly realized. Jiang Xu had always been invisible in China and the performance of the Cheetah team wasn\u2019t great. He had the title of best hunter but he was always ridiculed by netizens as not having enough strength. This time he proved himself in the World Competition. He might not have Li Cangyu\u2019s strength and hand speed but he was still an excellent player.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to ask Cat God. The national team has 22 players and you can choose from many combinations and team lineups. Isn\u2019t it chaotic before every match?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I will arrange the tactical commanders and let them choose their teammates.\u201d Li Cangyu smiled and replied. \u201cThis way, people will have a chance to lead a team in every match and the pressure on me and Xuefeng will be much smaller.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was always serious every time he answered questions relating to the game. The reporters quickly wrote it down while sighing at Cat God\u2019s strength. To be able to manage more than 20 people and not have ever match be chaotic, this showed that Li Cangyu was truly a rare genius.</p><br/><p>Another person asked, \u201cAccording to Cat God, the commanders and tactics will change in the next match against Italy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNaturally, although I can\u2019t disclose who they are.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, a blonde foreign female reporter with blue eyes stood up and asked a few questions in English.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu listened politely but only half understood. Once she finished her questions, Li Cangyu turned to Ling Xuefeng for him and Ling Xuefeng immediately whispered a translation in his ears.</p><br/><p>The reporter\u2019s question was, \u201cLi Cangyu\u2019s elf summoner is very strong. Do you have the confidence to defeat the American team\u2019s Jack and South Korea\u2019s Captain Park, who are top three players in the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu listened to Ling Xuefeng\u2019s translation and replied, \u201cThe rankings based on a player\u2019s popularity and data aren\u2019t necessarily accurate. Is a summoner with a winning percentage of 53% stronger than one with a winning percentage of 51%? Not necessarily. In my opinion, two people should at least fight against each other first before determining who is strong and who is weak. I haven\u2019t played with Jack and Park and can\u2019t answer this question. The certain thing is that they are very good players. If there is a chance to fight against them, I will let the audience judge who is stronger.\u201d</p><br/><p>His answer was very generous and the turned to Ling Xuefeng after finishing. The latter acted as his interpreted and repeated it in fluent English.</p><br/><p>The reporters, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Captain Ling, where was your coldness? Why do you seem so happy to translate for Cat God?</p><br/><p>Moreover, Ling Xuefeng\u2019s memory was really amazed. He remembered such a long passage and translated it without missing anything. Or perhaps he had a connection with Cat God and already guessed how Cat God would answer?</p><br/><p>The American reporter heard Ling Xuefeng\u2019s translation and sat down with satisfaction.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled at the man and said, \u201cYour English is really good. It was the correct decision to take you to the interview.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng was calm. \u201cThere are still many questions. Drink plenty of water and answer slowly.\u201d</p><br/><p>He handed the water bottle over to the other party and Li Cangyu drank it in a natural manner.</p><br/><p>The reporters, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The two men whispered together and handed each other water. It was simply treating the reporters as air!</p><br/><p>A reporter stood up and questioned, \u201cCaptain Ling, today\u2019s death racing was almost the Chinese team\u2019s exhibition game. You were really handsome when killing eight people. What did you think at the time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe super god was just a coincidence.\u201d Ling Xuefeng answered calmly. \u201cMy teammates worked well together. Yang Muzi\u2019s control was very timely, the output of Yan Guo was stable and Qin Mo used his blood kin pets to bit the opponents. This created the most favourable conditions for me to kill the Spanish players. At the time, I didn\u2019t think too much. I just used the moment to take away the heads of the residual blood opponents.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>They listened to his composed answer and felt admiration. If he got the super god achievement through a coincidence, did it mean he could kill 10 people if he deliberately tried?</p><br/><p>Compared to the flexible, quick and varied Cat God, Ling Xuefeng\u2019s style could be described with one word\u2014domineering!</p><br/><p>Both of them were summoners but their styles were very different.</p><br/><p>The strange thing was that when they sat together, they always gave people a feeling of harmony. They were the strongest opponents in China and killed all the way to the finals. It was either \u2018you die or I die.\u2019 However in the international competition, they were the captain and vice-captain of the national team. The two of them were complementary and showed a tacit understanding that was higher than any fixed partners.</p><br/><p>Even in the interview, they were constantly making eye contact and whispering from time to time\u2026</p><br/><p>Perhaps he was aware of the eyes of the reporters. Li Cangyu finally stopped whispering to Ling Xuefeng and told the reporters, \u201cIf you have any more questions, please ask.\u201d</p><br/><p>A reporter\u2019s spirit returned and he immediately stood up. \u201cI heard Sister Bing say that Bai Xuan\u2019s body was uncomfortable and he asked for leave today? There are many milk dad fans in China who are worrying right now. Cat God, can you tell us anything about how he is doing?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone can rest assured. Xiao Bai just hadn\u2019t adapted to the food after going abroad and his stomach isn\u2019t comfortable. I will let him rest for two days and he should return for the next match.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe found that Ah Shu also isn\u2019t in the match today. Is he sick as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, he stayed back to take care of Vice-Captain Bai. The Shu Bai combination will rest together.\u201d Li Cangyu explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre there any other players of the national team who haven\u2019t adapted after coming abroad.\u201d The reporters heard that Bai Xuan had eaten bad things and were worried.</p><br/><p>\u201cFortunately, other players aren\u2019t showing any reactions to the meals and they are getting plenty of sleep. You don\u2019t have to worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have a personal question for Cat God. Who are you sharing a room with during the World Competition?\u201d A young girl suddenly stood up. \u201cThere are quite a few fans in China who are concerned about this. Please introduce your roommate to us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu glanced over at LIng Xuefeng. \u201cDo you want to say a few words?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng replied lightly, \u201cI am his roommate. Cat God fans, do you have any opinions on this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cat God fans, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This was like \u2018I alone have your Cat God. Do you have any opinions?\u2019</p><br/><p>The Cat God fans really wanted to kill him!</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled happily and nodded. \u201cI am living with Xuefeng for the convenience of discussing match tactics. You don\u2019t have to worry too much about us. We both have no bad habits like snoring or strange dreams.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporter continued to want gossip. \u201cHow is Captain Ling\u2019s sleeping position?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled. \u201cIt is like how you imagine the male god. He frowns in bad and had the expression of \u2018anyone who disturbs me will die\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng looked over at him. \u201cIs that so?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, if you don\u2019t believe it then I will take a photo and show you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng coughed and changed the topic. \u201cAre the questions finished? We will go back to rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters saw Captain Ling\u2019s cold eyes and didn\u2019t dare ask anymore questions. They immediately shrank back and watched them leave.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>On the way back, Li Cangyu saw his stern expression and couldn\u2019t help whispered, \u201cAre you angry?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng told him, \u201cI\u2019m not that stingy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu came over, hugged him and looked at the other person gently.</p><br/><p>This close distance meant he could clearly see Ling Xuefeng\u2019s handsome facial features and his own reflection in Ling Xuefeng\u2019s eyes. Li Cangyu wanted to kiss him. Their lips were just about to touch when a puzzled voice was heard from the side, \u201cCat God?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was Cheng Wei and Tan Shitian.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu pushed Ling Xuefeng away and pretending to be calm as he faced Cheng Wei\u2019s curious eyes. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei still seemed surprised. \u201cI\u2019m coming back from the bathroom. What are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Ling Xuefeng wanted to destroy Cat God\u2019s brainless fan and Li Cangyu also wanted to block the mouth of this silly person.</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t he know that some questions shouldn\u2019t be asked?</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian made an awkward expression and coughed. \u201cCough, isn\u2019t it time to go back? Is the interview over?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng nodded. \u201cYes, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu turned away with Ling Xuefeng and Cheng Wei was left scratching his head.</p><br/><p>Just now, Ling Xuefeng was holding Cat God. What did he want to do?</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian saw that Cheng Wei was still thinking about this problem and was forced to pull him away. This EQ was low enough to kill him!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Zhuo Hang liked to boast about himself from time to time but the fact that he could muster up the courage to recommend himself proved this boy was very confident.</p><br/><p>On the field, confidence was better than inferiority.</p><br/><p>The facts proved that Zhuo Hang truly was talented and he smoothly passed the test.</p><br/><p>A week later, Li Cangyu summoned several teammates into the game and said happily in the voice room, \u201cI\u2019m here to share good news with everyone. Our new team members have finally all been found. If time permits, we will go to the Dragon Warriors Club on December 1st and officially start training!\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Siming excitedly filled the team channel with flowers. \u201cGreat! I\u2019ve been dreaming about this day!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han said, \u201cThe team formation is very fast.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang sent a row of kisses. \u201cCat God is awesome!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang was excited but he didn\u2019t know how to express it. He just quietly watched everyone.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan asked doubtfully, \u201cTraining is so soon? Didn\u2019t you plan to return to China after the Spring Festival?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect the change in competition methods in the seventh season to be so big.\u201d Li Cangyu explained. \u201cThe other day, Ling Xuefeng sent me the data from the league meeting. The next competition has changed a lot. We are a new team so we needed to train the members, but we also need to study the new competition method. Thus, the training time has to be pushed forward.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong said, \u201cI understand. I also read the new rules. It is a lot more complicated than the old rules. I have been officially released from the ICE Club and can return home at any time.</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming asked curiously, \u201cWhat are the new competition rules?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu said, \u201cThe changes are very big and I can\u2019t say them clearly. Let\u2019s wait until I go back and then we will study it carefully.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming was very simple. \u201cThen I will wait in Changsha for your return!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han stated, \u201cI can go to China at any time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang added, \u201cI\u2019m flying over on December 1st!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang whispered, \u201cI, I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming asked, \u201cDoes this mean we have four young people on the team?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan smiled and said, \u201cYes, there are more young players, making the team more energetic. This is great.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang\u2019s voice was too small and was drowned out. \u201cI, I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu heard the weak voice and couldn\u2019t help smiling., \u201cXiaojiang, what do you want to say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone calmed down as Li Xiaojiang stuttered with a red face. \u201cI, I wanted to say that I can also, also gather in December.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Young man, it was too hard to hear you say something!</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The eight people formed a new team.</p><br/><p>On November 30th, Li Cangyu, Bai Xuan, Xie Shurong and Xiao Han departed from New York and boarded a flight home.</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan knew that Cat God was coming back and gave face by personally picking him up at the airport. After picking up the four people at the airport, he wanted to hold a welcoming party but Li Cangyu stopped him. \u201cWait, there are two people arriving tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan patted Li Cangyu\u2019s shoulder and cried out, \u201cYou worked hard. I didn\u2019t think that you could actually form a team in less than half a year!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu stated, \u201cPerhaps I have better luck recently?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019ll go back and prepare the contracts. Then I will arrange the dorms. Do you think a double room, triple room or quadruple room will be more convenient?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu thought about it before replying, \u201cWe are eight people so two rooms of four should be suitable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem!\u201d Liu Chuan readily agreed.</p><br/><p>On the morning of December 1st, Li Xiaojiang and his cousin Li Hai took the high speed train from Wuhan to Changsha. At the same time Zhuo Hang checked in at Nanjing Airport.</p><br/><p>In the afternoon, Li Hai arrived at the headquarters of the Dragon Warriors Club with his younger cousin Li Xiaojiang.</p><br/><p>Li Hai saw the new office building, formal training room and meeting rooms of the Dragon Warriors Club and couldn\u2019t help patting his younger cousin\u2019s shoulder. His voice shook with excitement. \u201cXiaojiang, you should follow Cat God well. Then once you have good results, endorse Brother\u2019s online store. The keyboards and computer business will be even more on fire!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang nodded seriously. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them went to the hall of the club and saw a tall man waiting for them. This man was very handsome while his eyebrows were sharp. He saw the two of them and took the initiative to come forward. Holding out a hand, he smiled and said, \u201cHello, I am Old Cat Li Cangyu.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was a great god but there was no arrogance at all. He laughed honestly and gave people a very reliable first impression.</p><br/><p>Li Hai immediately shook his hand. \u201cHello Cat God! How are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang also excitedly said, \u201cCat God, Cat God is well!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu heard this familiar stuttering and couldn\u2019t help looking at the boy. Li Xiaojiang was thin and small. He seemed nervous as his cheeks were red and his black eyes were especially bright.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu quite liked this slow guy and couldn\u2019t help touching his head gently. He asked, \u201cAre you Xiaojiang?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang immediately nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then a sunny voice was heard from next to him. \u201cI am looking for Cat God. Is Cat God here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu saw this teenager\u2019s bright smile and tentatively asked, \u201cAre you Zhuo Hang?\u201d</p><br/><p>The teenager immediately came over and took the initiative to hug Li Cangyu. \u201cAre you Cat God? The actual Cat God! Hahaha. I am Zhuo Hang, that great elf hunter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Li Cangyu reluctantly pushed him away by 10 centimeters. Bai Xuan wasn\u2019t wrong when he said that this child was unrestrained. He hugged Li Cangyu when they met, like he wasn\u2019t afraid to die at all. Li Cangyu almost fell over.</p><br/><p>After stabilizing his feet, Li Cangyu patted him on the shoulder and said, \u201cGood elf hunter, are you here alone? Your parents didn\u2019t bring you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang immediately replied, \u201cI have grown up and I\u2019m an adult. I don\u2019t need to be brought here by my parents!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang who was brought here by his brother. \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang turned his head and saw the little guy standing next to him. He couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang stuttered out, \u201cI, I am Li, Li Xiaojiang.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang exclaimed, \u201cAh, the black magician?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang looked at him curiously. Li Xiaojiang wasn\u2019t good at communicating with people. His face turned red and he was embarrassed to speak.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu looked at the two of them and said, \u201cThe two of you have reported to me first.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>He headed to the meeting room with Li Xiaojiang and Zhuo Hang. Xiao Han, Xie Shurong and the other people were already chatting. Liu Chuan was also present. Li Cangyu walked up to Liu Chuan with the two teenagers and introduced them. \u201cThis is the boss of the Dragon Warriors Club.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHello Boss!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Hello Boss.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan looked carefully at the two teenagers in front of him. One was very small and stuttered. He was obviously very afraid. The other was tall and looked handsome despite his age. His personality was sunny and his actions generous. He was obviously a very bright person.</p><br/><p>Combined with the small madman Gu Siming and the mixed-race Xiao Han, the four youngsters of this new team had different personalities. It wasn\u2019t easy for Li Cangyu to collect so many youngsters!</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan smiled and shook hands with both of them. \u201cWelcome to the Dragon Warriors Club.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, he turned back to Li Cangyu.\u201dYou found many youngsters this time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI assembled a mahjong table.\u201d Li Cangyu looked at the four little boys in front of him and couldn\u2019t help smiling. \u201cThe four of them are 17 or 18 years old. They are in the best state so they can lead the team even after I retire.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true. Young players do have greater development potential.\u201d Liu Chuan paused and said, \u201cLet me first show the contract to everyone. If there are no problems then we will sign them today.\u201d</p><br/><p>He dialed a number inside the building. Soon afterwards, a middle-aged man came over with a pile of contracts in his hand.</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan introduced him. \u201cThis is Mr. Qi, the legal adviser of the Dragon Warriors Club. The previous contracts were handled by my Zewen but Zewen is busy leading the team. Thus, I specifically invited a lawyer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little boys, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This club actually had a special lawyer!</p><br/><p>Mr. Qi gave the contracts to everyone and said, \u201cTake a look at the contract first. If you have any questions, you can always ask me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The new players sat down and seriously examined their contract.</p><br/><p>After a while, Zhuo Hang looked up and asked, \u201cDo new people have to sign for three years?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Lawyer Qi explained, \u201cIt isn\u2019t easy for a team to train a player. If the contract is only for one or two years, many people will jump to another team after becoming gods. Then the efforts of the previous team would be wasted. Three years is enough for a contestant to mature. Then if they want to renew their contract, they can also get a pay raise.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang nodded. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang carefully examined the contract before decisively signing his name.</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang and Xiao Han didn\u2019t really understand the contract issues. They saw Zhuo Hang sign and followed him by signing.</p><br/><p>Uncle Zhang\u2019s contract had been signed last time and Xiao Gu was a member of the training camp, meaning he didn\u2019t need to re-sign. The other three teenagers were treated as newcomers but the Dragon Warriors Club was very good to the players. The conditions for them were excellent compared to other teams.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong and Bai Xuan\u2019s contracts were naturally different from the teenagers. A\u2019Shu was one of the Three Musketeers and famous while Vice-Captain Bai Xuan was Li Cangyu\u2019s old partner. The two people were qualified so their conditions were naturally much higher. Liu Chuan gave them the contract for star players.</p><br/><p>Everyone happily signed their contracts and Lawyer Qi gave them their own copies. Then Li Cangyu\u2019s new team was officially formed.</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan turned back and asked, \u201cCat God, is the name of the team still Canglan like we discussed at our first meeting?\u201d</p><br/><p>The first time Liu Chuan had run to Hangzhou to confirm the cooperative relationship with Li Cangyu he mentioned the name of the team. Li Cangyu couldn\u2019t think of anything good and decided to use Canglan.</p><br/><p>The cold and vastness of the swelling water, this was the name that Bai Xuan thought of when they transferred to Wulin and it was quite artistic.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Li Cangyu\u2019s team didn\u2019t win any trophies after transferring to Wulin. This had always been Li Cangyu\u2019s biggest regret.</p><br/><p>Now that he had a brand new team in Miracle, he wanted to achieve the dream that hadn\u2019t been realized for many years.</p><br/><p>If one day, the Canglan team could really stand on stage at the awards ceremony, wouldn\u2019t the old friends that struggled with him for so many years also feel relieved?</p><br/><p>Li Canglan thought of this and a hint of determination filled his eyes. He smiled and said, \u201cThe name of the new team is Canglan.\u201d</p><br/><p>New players using the old team name, just like an old bottle is filled with new wine.</p><br/><p>The team was changed and filled with vigorous and strong teammates. The things that remained unchanged were the persistent dream and the firm heart.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

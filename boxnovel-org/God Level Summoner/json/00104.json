The youngsters all listened carefully. As Cat God said, they were familiar with the class they played but they had little knowledge of other professions. This was such a systematic and comprehensive lecture that they had a deeper understanding of all professions.</p><br/><p>Next, Li Cangyu took everyone to the Canglan team\u2019s training room.</p><br/><p>The training room had dozens of computers side by side, more than enough for eight people. The computer configurations were also at the highest level and the keyboard and mouse were of excellent quality.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu asked everyone to find a place to sit down and turn on the computer. There were some small training software programs on the desktop. Li Cangyu introduced the functions of these softwares and then arranged training tasks.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Gu, you have been in the training camp for half a year. Your foundation is very solid so your training time has been reduced. Every morning and afternoon, take half an hour to stabilize the hand speed. The rest of the time, follow Uncle Zhang to understand the operations of all the classes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand!\u201d Gu Siming nodded seriously.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu went on to say, \u201cXiao Han, Xiao Li and Xiao Zhuo, all three of you haven\u2019t received systematic training. Starting today, you must begin from the most basic training. Practice one hour of random walking in the morning, an hour of steady hand speed training and spend one hour familiarizing yourself with the maps. In the afternoon, go to the cross-server arena to find someone to practice with and then practice with your teacher to strengthen your class.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Li\u2019s teacher is Vice-Captain Bai, Xiao Zhuo\u2019s teacher is A\u2019Shu and Xiao Han will be taught by me. If there are any problems, don\u2019t hide it. Boldly ask your teacher.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are new people. It isn\u2019t shameful to ask questions. If you don\u2019t understand and don\u2019t ask then you will harm not only yourselves but others as well, do you understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>The three teenagers immediately nodded. \u201cI understand!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is still a problem that needs to be emphasized.\u201d Li Cangyu continued saying, \u201cThe four of you are almost the same age and you are equally good in my heart. I hope the four of you can form a virtuous competitive atmosphere. Let\u2019s make progress together. Don\u2019t compare each other or secretly compete in the dark. Do what you should do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDuring matches, I will send different people to play according to different tactics. In the future, you will form a cooperation with each other. Remember, you are teammates, not enemies.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu\u2019s words were very serious. The thing he cared about the most was the unity of the team.</p><br/><p>No matter how strong the team, if there was a crack then the team wouldn\u2019t be far from death, just like the roots of a tree rotting.</p><br/><p>The four teenagers were very simple but they would be in the competition in the future. It was difficult to ensure that they don\u2019t compete with each other over strength or popularity. Li Cangyu didn\u2019t want these four children to have hostility. He hoped they would grow up together, overcoming problems and supporting the Canglan team to the end.</p><br/><p>The young teenagers nodded slightly, causing Li Cangyu to smile and raise his right hand. \u201cOkay, start the training!\u201d</p><br/><p>This action was decisive and handsome. The several young teenagers immediately made looks of worship and started to concentrate on the training, afraid that they would be slower than others.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan laughed. Four little milk cats being obediently trained by the cat god. At the very least, there was no need to worry about them fighting each other in the future.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>In the afternoon, Li Cangyu let the four teenagers go to the arena by themselves. There was too much knowledge input so he had to leave them time to digest and ponder on it.</p><br/><p>The arena practice had just been arranged when Wu Zewen knocked on the door and handed a USB to Li Cangyu. \u201cThis is the data on the teams in the second division as well as a modeling of the Miracle maps that Liu Chuan had me organize for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu happily accept it. \u201cThank you so much!\u201d</p><br/><p>The school tyrant\u2019s organizational ability was first-class, which really helped the busy Li Cangyu!</p><br/><p>Wu Zewen adjusted his glasses and said, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome. I\u2019m glad to help.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu said, \u201cI also hope you achieve good results in the playoffs.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Zewen nodded earnestly. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><br/><p>He left and Li Cangyu immediately accessed the USB flash drive to check.</p><br/><p>He was very confident about winning the second division but the situation on the field was always changing. There was always a danger of losing, making it good to know more about the opponent. The data compiled by Wu Zewen listed the ace players and basic tactical styles of each team, which was quite practical.</p><br/><p>In addition, there was a modeling of the map library which made Li Cangyu stunned.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a secret since the Miracle League had published this information in the league\u2019s maps and had a special map package software. As long as this map was installed on the computer, all game maps could be seen.</p><br/><p>However, Wu Zewen used his powerful spatial analysis ability to mark many blind spots on the map with coordinates.</p><br/><p>This was invaluable information that was exclusive to the Dragon Warriors.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu studied the map carefully. The more he looked, the more he liked it. According to the characteristics of the maps, he could arrange a variety of tactics for different teams in the future.</p><br/><p>He was busy studying when Liu Chuan knocked on the door. He was very pleased when he saw everyone training and said, \u201cDon\u2019t you look serious? Am I interrupting?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu raised his head and said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. Does Boss want anything from me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan stated, \u201cI got the new competition rules from the Miracle League. Do you want to see it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone heard about the new competition rules and looked up curiously.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it so show it to everyone else.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan sent a copy of the file to everyone. The group of people looked at it and became excited. Xiao Gu almost jumped up as he exclaimed, \u201cWow, it is a big change. It is completely different from the old arena rules!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han also said, \u201cThe new competition has changed from moving the crystal to destroying the crystal?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang seemed to know the competitive game very well. He spoke the key points in a brief summary. \u201cIt is the tower defense mode. The economic difference will determine the outcome. This makes the tactics more changeable and the game more interesting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu glanced at him with appreciation and asked, \u201cXiao Zhou, don\u2019t you know a lot about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang laughed. \u201cSomeone in my family has played this type of competitive game before. I have been watching it since I was a child.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was no wonder that he could capture the key points of the contract. There were insiders inside his family.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu put away his curiosity and said, \u201cThe changes for the new competition are really big. Previously, we would get a point if we captured the crystal and moved the crystal back to our base. The new system requires us to destroy the crystal to get points.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe front and rear of the crystal respectively have the ice phoenix and fire phoenix as guards. The attack power is extremely strong and they will appear after a certain period of time. There are four defense towers in the east, west, south and north. Outside the defense towers is a foggy area and there are some mobs that will give a status bonus after killing them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu paused and said, \u201cThe key to the new system is to kill all types of mobs in the wild area to make money and accumulate an economy advantage. Once you have money, you can buy equipment in the battlefield store. The new rules means that in the middle of the game, we can choose equipment that is beneficial to us or can target the enemies.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming exclaimed, \u201cThe way of playing has really changed! The crystal is equivalent to the ultimate boss. The ice phoenix and fire phoenix are two small bosses while the defense towers are the surrounding elite monsters. If we want to break the crystal in the middle, we must first take care of the surrounding four defense towers and the ice and fire phoenix. Is that right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu nodded. \u201cThis is what it means. I just saw the map data compiled by Captain Wu. Most of the crystals will refresh in the middle of the map. There are four roads leading to the crystal location and many mobs on the road that can be killed for experience. The fields between the roads are suitable for ambush tactics. This system is much more tactically interesting than the previous crystal mode.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan heard this and couldn\u2019t help smiling. \u201cThe big change in the competition is actually good for our new team. Other teams have to face new rules and will certainly train again from the beginning. It is equivalent to standing at the same starting point as us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Li Cangyu looked back. \u201cIt is currently December. There are only two months left until the second division that starts in February. There is also the Spring Festival holiday, making our timing quite tight. The next training tasks will be very heavy and the newcomers might be under great pressure. I hope that everyone can grit their teeth to survive this difficult stage. Will you show me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Gu answered in a positive manner. \u201cCaptain, I have no problem staying up late to train. I like training!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang also said, \u201cI have no problems. Cat God can arrange it however you like.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han\u2019s eyes were firm. \u201cMaster, rest assured that I can hold on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang looked up at Li Cangyu and said seriously. \u201cI, I also have no, no, no problems.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled and thought, \u2018Since you made your guarantees in person, don\u2019t blame me for trying to trample on you.\u2019</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan thought sympathetically, \u2018Small milk cats, be ready to be abused by the big cat!\u2019</p><br/>\n</div>"}

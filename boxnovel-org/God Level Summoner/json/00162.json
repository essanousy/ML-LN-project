It was the first time he had been confessed to and the other person was the joker Ah Shu. Bai Xuan didn\u2019t know if he should laugh or cry.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan shifted his gaze with embarrassement from Xie Shurong\u2019s shining eyes and coughed. \u201cAh Shu, stop messing around. This type of joke can\u2019t be said.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong wondered, \u201cDo you think I\u2019m joking?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong stepped forward, gently holding Bai Xuan\u2019s shoulders with both hands and whispering, \u201cI didn\u2019t intend to say it so early but I don\u2019t want you to misunderstand. I want to be close to you because I like you. This isn\u2019t a joke.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have been playing the game for the past few years and never chased after another person. Thus, after I realized I like you, I didn\u2019t know how to express myself. I just wanted to be closer to you. It would be good if I could see you every day\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong seemed a bit embarrassed and stopped here. He gently touched his nose before speaking again, \u201cBai Xuan, my feelings for you are serious. Please don\u2019t doubt my heart. I usually like to joke but I would never joke about feelings. This is the first time I\u2019ve confessed to someone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The expression on the young man\u2019s face was extraordinarily serious and he didn\u2019t seem to be joking.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan didn\u2019t know how to deal with this matter. He was always calm but at his moment, he felt that his head was swimming and his mind was a confused mess.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong\u2019s serious confession sounded very moving but the key was\u2026 Bai Xuan saw him as a brother!</p><br/><p>Ever since eating a Chinese meal in the US, Xie Shurong would often make excuses to run over for a meal. Every time he washed the dishes, he would have a bitter face. Then after returning home, he would always say, \u201cVice-Captain Bai, I want to eat this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In Bai Xuan\u2019s view, Xie Shurong was a little brother who hadn\u2019t grown up yet. He was capricious and childish but Bai Xuan could tolerate it. Sometimes he felt that Ah Shu was somewhat cute.</p><br/><p>It never occurred to him that Xie Shurong would like him\u2026</p><br/><p>The shock in Bai Xuan\u2019s heart couldn\u2019t be described with words.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong was embarrassed by Bai Xuan\u2019s shocked eyes and scratched his head. \u201cWhat? Do you think I\u2019m immature? I might have a poor mouth and like to brag but aren\u2019t I reliable in critical moments?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan explained, \u201cI\u2019m not saying that you\u2019re unreliable. I\u2019m just surprised. How can you like me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong asked, \u201cWhy not? You are so good. It is normal to like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan stated, \u201cI\u2019m a man.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong grinned, revealing neat white teeth. \u201cI am also a man. See how well matched we are? We even have the same gender.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This person\u2019s poor mouth was simply irrefutable!</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong smiled and patted Bai Xuan\u2019s shoulder in comfort. \u201cI understand your concerns. I\u2019ve been abroad for a long time and I\u2019ve seen many loving same-sex couples on the street. There are even gay lovers who will hold hands to get married. In my opinion, feelings are the purest thing in the world. I don\u2019t need too many reasons to like a person and there is no need for scruples. If I like a person then I should fight for them. You being a man isn\u2019t an obstacle between us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong took a deep breath and stared gently at Bai Xuan. \u201cI like you, I hope you can think about me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThink about it, aren\u2019t I tall and handsome? Isn\u2019t my face pleasant to look at? I am very powerful when playing the game and am the perfect partner to cooperate with you. I can help you clean the table, wash dishes and cut vegetables. If you promise to be my boyfriend, I will listen to you unconditionally and hand you my salary card. If you tell me to go East then I will never go West. Where else can you find such an obedient boyfriend? Just accept me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>His heart had been somewhat touched when hearing Xie Shurong express feelings of love. Then his style changed. How could this guy start to brag when he was confessing. He directly called himself tall, handsome and obedient?</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong, don\u2019t you know that your face has fallen to the ground again?</p><br/><p>However, Bai Xuan couldn\u2019t help feeling funny and soft when seeing this person\u2019s cheeky expression. This person was obviously sincere. A person would always feel a strange uneasiness in front of their beloved. Xie Shurong was worried that Bai Xuan wouldn\u2019t see him and worked hard to list his various advantages.</p><br/><p>In fact, Bai Xuan knew that this person might have a poor mouth that made people want to beat him up but he was reliable in key moments. He was indeed very handsome.</p><br/><p>It was a pity\u2026</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t the type that Bai Xuan liked.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan discovered his sexuality in university. He had a mild temper since childhood and didn\u2019t have too fierce a reaction to this matter. He accepted it naturally.</p><br/><p>Then he discovered there was a 1 and 0 in gay relationships (gong and shou). After watching a real video, Bai Xuan sensed that he was a 0. It was because in his dreams, he found out that he was the one being pressed down\u2026</p><br/><p>He also accepted this matter sensibly. Was there a need to be a gong in this world?</p><br/><p>Of course, he wasn\u2019t the type of gay person that people typically had stereotypes about. He was very manly and seemed like a brother next door type that women liked.</p><br/><p>In his school years, he had many female friends because he had a good temper and always thoughtfully listened to the other person. The girls regarded him as a brother or a male friend. He didn\u2019t have any troubles in regards with being pursued by girls.</p><br/><p>His usual performance was no different from other males and his male friends also regarded him as a good friend.</p><br/><p>At the age of 18, he started to play in the professional league with Li Cangyu. The team\u2019s performance in the first few years was bad and the pressure was very big. Later, they experienced two disbandments and reorganizations. Bai Xuan was busy and didn\u2019t have time to consider these emotional problems, meaning he was single.</p><br/><p>By all accounts, he and Li Cangyu got along well. Since he liked men and Li Cangyu was the manly type, he should\u2019ve tried it with Li Cangyu.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Bai Xuan didn\u2019t feel that way about Li Cangyu. The two people were too familiar with each other and they had a pure friendship. Bai Xuan didn\u2019t want to change this relationship. In his opinion, the current mode of getting along with Li Cangyu was excellent.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan\u2019s type was a mature and stable man. He liked men who wore suits and ties. They should be elegant and knowledgeable. Some people would look very attractive if they had their own career or dared to start their own business.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong was too lively and always smiling every day. If Bai Xuan liked mature men, Ah Shu was a cute and childish man. The gap between him and Bai Xuan\u2019s ideal type was too big.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan thought about it carefully and decided to reject Ah Shu early on.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Ah Shu, I always thought of you as\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong immediately interrupted him with a pause gesture while smiling bitterly. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t want to hear the good person and brother card. You are rejecting me, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan spoke with regret, \u201cYes, I don\u2019t like you and I don\u2019t want you to waste your time on me. It is better to clearly tell you my feelings.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was why Xie Shurong appreciated Bai Xuan. Bai Xuan was gentle but also principled when handling things.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan wasn\u2019t a soft bun that people could pinch or flatten. He does things decisively and never dragged it out. He didn\u2019t like to muddy the waters and thought that speaking directly was the best solution.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong was uncomfortable about being rejected but he quickly adjusted his expression. He showed Bai Xuan a smile that said he didn\u2019t mind and told Bai Xuan, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. Love at first sight is a minority. Many relationships form after one side takes the initiative. You don\u2019t feel anything for me now but maybe you will like me after a while? I won\u2019t give up so soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan helplessly told him, \u201cYou aren\u2019t the type I like.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat type do you like?\u201d Xie Shurong reflexively asked before he suddenly hesitated. He noticed the key meaning of this sentence. \u201cWait, you mean you like men but I\u2019m not your type?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan smiled slightly. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan didn\u2019t intend to hide this from Ah Shu. It would be too terrible of him if he deliberately said that he liked girls to reject the other person. Since Ah Shu treated him sincerely, he didn\u2019t want to lie. There was nothing wrong with being honest.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong heard this answer and his mood became complicated. He thought it would be difficult to bend Vice-Captain Bai. The result was that Vice-Captain Bai was originally bent but he didn\u2019t like this type of man.</p><br/><p>In fact, this was great. It omitted the most difficult process of getting a straight man to change their preferences. You know, forcing a straight person was unethical. This thing couldn\u2019t be publicly told to their family. However, since Bai Xuan didn\u2019t like women, Xie Shurong had no such concerns and could safely pursue him!</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong couldn\u2019t help giving a big smile when he thought of this. He looked at Bai Xuan and said, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. Maybe I can\u2019t become the type you like but I will try to make you like me.\u201d</p><br/><p>He continued, \u201cHaven\u2019t you heard this before? Before encountering true love, a person might think they should like someone of a certain type. Then they meet someone they really like only to discover that the previous conditions they set for themselves could all be ignored!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong\u2019s words were true. In fact, many people had conditions when choosing a partner. For example, the height and the personality\u2026</p><br/><p>Still, God wouldn\u2019t customize a person that met all requirements. A person might arrive who didn\u2019t meet the relationship criteria originally set.</p><br/><p>After falling in love, all previous conditions would be subconsciously left behind.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong believed that he could use his sincerity to impress Bai Xuan.</p><br/><p>Perhaps he wasn\u2019t as mature and stable as Bai Xuan liked, nor did he wear a suit and tie like an elite worker, but he could heat up Bai Xuan\u2019s heart. He could tease Bai Xuan to make him laugh, help warm Bai Xuan\u2019s bed, give Bai Xuan a reliable shoulder when he was tired and give Bai Xuan a warm hug when he was cold.</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t give up on you.\u201d Xie Shurong\u2019s smile was particularly bright and dazzling under the light coming in from the window. \u201cBai Xuan, even if you don\u2019t like me now, please give me a chance to pursue you. Don\u2019t just deal the death penalty. Can\u2019t you give me a reprieve?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong showed his thick skin. \u201cIsn\u2019t it okay? Give me a period of time where I can show you. If you still feel that I am annoying then it won\u2019t be too late to drive me away. Don\u2019t you think it is cruel to directly impose the death penalty? My heart is bleeding\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan looked at this cute guy wagging his tail and finally smiled helplessly. \u201cHow long should the trial period be?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is best if it is a lifetime!\u201d Xie Shurong exclaimed.</p><br/><p>Then he saw Bai Xuan\u2019s stare and immediately changed it. \u201cHow about half a year?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan nodded. \u201cThen I will give you six months. Still, I\u2019ll tell you in advance. I really don\u2019t like your type.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong made an OK gesture while thinking in his heart, \u2018The more stubborn a person is, the easier it is to be hit in the face. Vice-Captain Bai, I am looking forward to the day when you change your mind and will blush when asking for a kiss!\u2019</p><br/><p>This scene was bound to be better than all dreams.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

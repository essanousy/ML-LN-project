A plate of west lake vinegar fish was brought out and the greedy Xie Shurong soon cleared the plate. He smiled and said, \u201cIt\u2019s delicious but I still like your cooking.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Bai Xuan asked in a puzzled manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause I like you.\u201d Xie Shurong answered like it was natural but Bai Xuan quickly became uncomfortable and removed his gaze.</p><br/><p>As a result, he turned his head and saw a familiar man coming to this side. The man was obviously stunned before smiling and walking over to Bai Xuan. He gracefully reached out and spoke, \u201cXiao Bai? It\u2019s been a long time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan politely shook hands with him. \u201cBrother, what a coincidence.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong heard Bai Xuan\u2019s words and couldn\u2019t help looking up at the \u2018senior.\u2019 The man looked quite handsome. He was dressed in a well-cut grey suit and the briefcase in his hand and the shoes on his feet were from big international brands. However, they were relatively low-key styles. Their price wasn\u2019t obvious by looking.</p><br/><p>A low-key, calm and elite man, it was the type that Bai Xuan liked!</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong\u2019s ears pricked in a vigilant manner.</p><br/><p>After the greeting, the man asked, \u201cIs it convenient to sit down for a while?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan pointed to the seat next to him and smiled. \u201cSit down and eat together. This meal is my treat.\u201d The waiter came at the right timing and Bai Xuan softly requested, \u201cHello, can I add a few more dishes here? Please give the menu.\u201d</p><br/><p>This brother kept staring at Bai Xuan and after the waiter left, he said, \u201cYour temper hasn\u2019t changed. You are as gentle as before.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan touched his nose in an embarrassed manner and didn\u2019t know how to answer.</p><br/><p>He knew this senior classmate from university. His dormitory was upstairs and both of them were students of the Foreign Languages Department. They also graduated from the same high school and their relationship was closer than other students.</p><br/><p>During their school days, this classmate was considered to be famous. There was a time when foreign experts came to the school and he did a simultaneous interpretation. He was praised and entered a foreign company directly after graduation.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan had little contact with his former alumni after becoming an e-sports player. He only occasionally heard news about his schoolmate. Bai Xuan didn\u2019t think much of their encounter today and took the initiative to use his brother to sit down and have a meal together.</p><br/><p>The man was curious about Bai Xuan\u2019s recent situation. \u201cI heard that you went to the World Competition and took the championship?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan replied modestly, \u201cIt is because the players of the national team are excellent.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man smiled. \u201cYou must be good to be selected for the national team. I don\u2019t know e-sports but there are many people in the alumni group who have been boasting about you in the past few days. Many girls want to find you to get your signature.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that right? So exaggerated\u2026\u201d Bai Xuan was too embarrassed and changed the topic. \u201cDo you want to order two more dishes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, you know I don\u2019t eat much.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two people chatted naturally to each other while next to them, Xie Shurong was becoming more annoyed. The west lake vinegar fish that he just ate had a sour taste in his stomach. The elite man in front of him wasn\u2019t pleasing to the eye. The thick wax on his hair was particularly ugly and was inferior to Xie Shurong\u2019s short hair. The man\u2019s clothes were old-fashioned and there was no fresh energy.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong didn\u2019t want to see the two old schoolmates catching up and had to lower his head. He directed his indignation at the food and quickly swept up the plates in front of him.</p><br/><p>The man finally seemed to notice that someone else was sitting at the table and asked, \u201cThis is?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan introduced them. \u201cThis is Ah Shu. He is my\u2026 teammate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong obviously wasn\u2019t very happy to hear this introduction. He glanced at Bai Xuan grievously and seemed to be wondering \u2018why didn\u2019t you say I am your boyfriend?\u2019 Bai Xuan guiltily looked away and bowed his head to eat.</p><br/><p>At the end of the meal, Bai Xuan wanted to get up and pay for the bill. The man graciously held his arm and smiled. \u201cI will pay. How can I let my school brother pay the bill?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan refuted, \u201cPreviously, you always paid when inviting me to a meal in school. Let me pay this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. This should be my treat.\u201d He turned and paid with his card. Bai Xuan had to helplessly get up and leave with Xie Shurong.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Dinner ended and this brother drove away. Bai Xuan sent Xie Shurong back to the hotel and wanted to separate at the entrance when Xie Shurong suddenly said, \u201cI have something to ask you. Go to my room and sit down.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan had to go upstairs with him. As a result, Xie Shurong kissed Bai Xuan against the door the moment they entered.</p><br/><p>The kiss was so hot it almost melted a person. Bai Xuan was breathless as he pushed Xie Shurong away and wondered, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong looked wronged. \u201cI\u2019m not happy and want to kiss you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan was puzzled. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you happy? Didn\u2019t you like the food at the restaurant?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you see that I\u2019m jealous!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan was stunned. He looked at this angry appearance and couldn\u2019t help looking.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong turned away. \u201cI\u2019m jealous. Find a way to comfort me or I won\u2019t get up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he lay on the bed like a child, rolling around in his quilt and looking up at Bai Xuan with a wronged expression.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan was simply stunned. How could such a big person be so naive?</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong continued to call out, \u201cI want milk dad\u2019s hug and kiss, or I will lose blood and die.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Bai Xuan rolled his eyes. \u201cThen keep losing blood and died.\u201d</p><br/><p>He turned to walk away. Xie Shurong suddenly jumped out of bed and hugged Bai Xuan from behind, using his hands and feet to press Bai Xuan onto the bed.</p><br/><p>The petulant child who was acting spoiled suddenly showed such agility and decisiveness.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan stared up at the young man pressing on his body and couldn\u2019t help thinking about it. Did Xie Shurong\u2019s body have two souls? One was a childish rascal like a puppy while the other was decisively sharp like a fierce wolf.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan couldn\u2019t break away and had to helplessly say, \u201cYou are thinking too much. I have an ordinary relationship with that brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong asked sharply, \u201cThen why did he often invite you to eat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan was stunned. This sentence in the conversation had been completely remembered by Xie Shurong.</p><br/><p>He stretched out a hand to pinch this person\u2019s face and smiled. \u201cHe asked me to eat a few times because I know him and his girlfriend. I indirectly pulled the strings for him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong heard these words and his heart finally returned to normal. He bent over and rubbed his head against Bai Xuan\u2019s white neck. \u201cAfter you saw him, you no longer looked at me. He is the type you like and I\u2019m\u2026 worried you won\u2019t want me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan\u2019s neck was very itchy but his heart softened. He patted Xie Shurong\u2019s head and said, \u201cHow can I not want you? The boyfriend who just got promoted, how can I dismiss you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong continued to rub against Bai Xuan\u2019s neck. \u201cIs there a bonus after the promotion? Will it be higher than the internship period?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat bonus?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong gently pecked Bai Xuan\u2019s lips. \u201cFor example, accompanying you to eat will be rewarded with a hug. Making you happy will be rewarded with a kiss. It would be nice if you could reward yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan was amused and hit him. \u201cGet off.\u201d</p><br/><p>Instead, Xie Shurong reached out and hugged him, \u201cI don\u2019t want to get off. If I leave you alone, you will be taken away.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then his hands and feet wrapped around Bai Xuan like a large koala.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan struggled but he wasn\u2019t Xie Shurong\u2019s opponent in physical strength. The moment he freed his left foot, his right foot was trapped again. He kicked his right feet and Xie Shurong\u2019s used his feet to hold Bai Xuan.</p><br/><p>The two people played in bed for a long time. The tired and panting Bai Xuan finally found a chance and turned around, pressing back Xie Shurong. He was laughing and about to announce his victory when he unexpectedly found something hard against himself.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan realized what it was and his face reddened and he shot off the bed like he got an electric shock.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong gently pulled his hand and touched it to the part of his body reacting \u201cIf you leave, what about my little brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan was going to collapse. Could this person not speak so directly?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

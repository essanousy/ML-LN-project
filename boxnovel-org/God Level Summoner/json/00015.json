His blood was presently at 40% and this was enough to clear up the opposite summoners.</p><br/><p>\u2014Fireball, Fireball, Summon Thunder Spirit, Thunder\u2019s Wrath!</p><br/><p>Brilliant flames burst out like fireworks, followed by purple thunder. There was a booming sound and Popular Land Under Heaven and Same Boat Under Wind and Rain fell directly to the ground!</p><br/><p>[Love to Eat Braised Fish has killed Popular Land Under Heaven.]</p><br/><p>[Love to Eat Braised Fish has killed Same Boat Under Wind and Rain.]</p><br/><p>Wind Colour: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The battle just started and the president and one vice president had inexplicably died. Fortunately, Popular Land Under Heaven was still calm and not flustered by his death. He immediately said, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have much blood left. Quickly kill him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu endured the consequences of killed the two summoners and only had residual blood from the black magicians\u2019 spells.</p><br/><p>Only 15% of his health remained!</p><br/><p>At this moment, Xie Shurong suddenly returned from the front lines towards the healer, using Spirit Lock to freeze the berserker in place!</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan had received the interference of the berserker and could only protect himself. Now that Xie Shurong was controlling the other person, Bai Xuan was freed and immediately used a few small healing spells on Li Cangyu, returning the bloody Cat God\u2019s health back to 30%!</p><br/><p>Cat God immediately took advantage of his health returning and took advantage of the elf\u2019s agility, using Flying Feather Steps. He walked to the other side\u2019s healer and froze him with the water spirit, followed by summoning the fire spirits and continuously releasing Fireballs.</p><br/><p>[Love to Eat Braised Fish has killed Wind Blows Falling Leaves.]</p><br/><p>[I will give the black magicians to you. Li Cangyu still had room to type of the team channel while killing.</p><br/><p>[OK.] Xie Shurong also typed two letters before using his big move Light and Shadow Rotation. The white sword spun in the air, quickly killing the two black magicians.</p><br/><p>In the end, there was only the pitiful berserker left and the two combined forces to make him fall helplessly.</p><br/><p>[The team of Popular Land Under Heaven has failed to intercept the bounty mission. 300 gold coins and 3,000 experience will be deducted per person.</p><br/><p>[This mission reward has accumulated 10,600 gold coins and 106,000 experience.]</p><br/><p>[Love to Eat Braised Fish\u2019s team bounty mission will continue.]</p><br/><p>These three system messages almost made Popular Land Under Heaven cough up blood!</p><br/><p>Was there a mistake?</p><br/><p>He took the guild\u2019s strongest members to intercept the bounty mission and teach these three people a good lesson. The result was a complete destruction by the three players and he also gave the other party a bunch of gold coins and experience?</p><br/><p>Once everyone left the instance, Li Cangyu didn\u2019t bother talking to them again, quickly walking to the target\u2019s mission point.</p><br/><p>The NPC was successfully escorted to the destination and the bounty mission was finally completed!</p><br/><p>[Congratulations to Love to Eat Braised Fish\u2019s team on the success of the bounty mission!]</p><br/><p>The three people each gained 106,000 experience, causing their body to glow with a continuous white light as they instantly gained two levels, rising to level 22.</p><br/><p>The gold coins were equally divided, each person getting 3,533 gold coins.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu opened the parcel and watched his originally pitiful 300 gold coins before 3,833 gold coins. He was in a good mood as he typed: [Let\u2019s do another round.]</p><br/><p>[Okay!] Both Bai Xuan and Xie Shurong agreed.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Many people at the scene watched the backs of the three people walking away and looked at each other.</p><br/><p>Who were these people? They were strong enough to defy the sky?</p><br/><p>The president of the Flying Feathers Guild, who had been ready to intercept the mission, looked at the Wind Colour group with a complicated expression. After a moment of silence, he said, \u201cWithdraw! We will withdraw first!\u201d</p><br/><p>Flying Feather Ares made a bloody expression. \u201cWe aren\u2019t fighting?\u201d</p><br/><p>President Flying Feathers Liangshan said calmly, \u201cPopular Land Under Heaven took so many masters with him and was killed. Do you think the three people team of Love to Eat Braised Fish is very simple? Since they dared to do a bounty mission with three people, they aren\u2019t afraid of being robbed. This proves they have the capital and confident to not be robbed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Flying Feathers Ares took some time before typing: [That makes sense!]</p><br/><p>Flying Feathers Liangshan said, \u201cWe will first withdraw and wait and see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Among the Time Guild members who were also onlookers, Luo Xiaoluo said excitedly, \u201cI told you that Braised Fish is a master! The Wind Colour team has been destroyed, hahahaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>Time Machine sent him a slapped face expression. [In order to get the vice-captain\u2019s signature, I leave the responsibility of pulling him over to you.]</p><br/><p>Luo Xiaoluo was excited. [Yes!]</p><br/><p>It was only in the destroyed Wind Colour Guild that no one spoke for a long time.</p><br/><p>The elite elite led by the vice president was destroyed and this could be called a moment of loss. The president personally leading a team filled with three vice presidents was still wiped out, this couldn\u2019t be explained as a simple loss.</p><br/><p>Popular Land Under Heaven frowned. \u201cWhat is the origin of these three people?\u201d</p><br/><p>Vice President Same Boat Under Wind and Rain hesitated for a moment before saying, \u201cAre they professional players from a team training camp? I feel that these three people are very strong. Their standards are beyond simple online gaming masters.\u201d</p><br/><p>Popular Land Under Heaven immediately denied it. \u201cImpossible! Players from training camps wouldn\u2019t go online in the middle of the night. It is almost 2 a.m!\u201d</p><br/><p>It really was two in the morning domestically. The guild members stayed up late because a new district just opened and they wanted to rush to the top of the rankings. However, professional team members had strictly regulated training times. No newcomer in a team would dare to on to the online game in the middle of the night.</p><br/><p>Same Boat Under Wind and Rain thought for a moment before suggesting, \u201cDo you want to talk to Qin Mo tomorrow and let him see?\u201d</p><br/><p>Popular Land Under Heaven frowned even more. \u201cDisturbing him for this thing\u2026 is it okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Same Boat Under Wind and Rain said, \u201cI recorded a video. It shouldn\u2019t be a problem to watch the video for a few minutes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Popular Land Under Heaven nodded. \u201cThen I will do so. I will find him tomorrow morning after eating.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The second round of escorting the NPC to the designated location started. This time, the major guilds had learnt and didn\u2019t come to intercept Love to Eat Braised Fish. Only unidentified random teams who didn\u2019t know the truth intercepted them twice, making the experience and gold far worse than the first time.</p><br/><p>However, a bounty mission was still faster than leveling in an instance.</p><br/><p>Later, even random players didn\u2019t come to intercept them. It was estimated that many people knew the IDs of Love to Eat Braised Fish, Love to Eat Twice-cooked Pork and Blossoming Tree and avoided these people, treating them as bosses.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu kept doing the bounty and the speed of their experience gain was so fast that they rose to level 30 by 5 p.m.</p><br/><p>At this point, it was five in the morning domestically. The presidents of the major guilds were shocked to see Love to Eat Braised Fish, Love to Eat Twice-cooked Pork and Blossoming Tree in the top 30.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre these three from leveling studios?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t they sleep?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can they stay up all night?\u201d</p><br/><p>No one thought that these three people were jet-lagged parties and that it was only afternoon in New York.</p><br/><p>They finished several rounds of bounty missions and rose to the next level at 5:30, all three of them level 31. Li Cangyu\u2019s hands finally left the keyboard and he looked back at Bai Xuan. \u201cIt is 5:30. Should we cook dinner?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan immediately corrected him. \u201cIt is me, not us! Kitchen idiot, stop messing around right now.]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu nodded. \u201cThen I will leave it to you. Steamed fish please.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan laughed. \u201cI know, Mr. Cat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan closed his account and went to make dinner. Soon, fragrant stir-fries filled the table.</p><br/><p>At 6 o\u2019clock, the doorbell rang on time. Xie Shurong had apparently arrived. Bai Xuan wiped his hands on the apron and went to open the door.</p><br/><p>Once he opened the door, Bai Xuan couldn\u2019t help feeling stunned.</p><br/><p>The man standing at the door was wearing a simple white T-shirt and dark blue jeans. He was tall, slender and handsome, with exceptionally deep and bright eyes. Once he saw Bai Xuan, his eyes showed a clear smile as he said, \u201cVice-Captain Bai, long time no see.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In Bai Xuan\u2019s memory, Xie Shurong was clearly shorter than him! How did he grow so fast in three years?</p><br/><p>Moreover, his voice had lowered and he obviously matured a lot. But a vague sense of the young boy could be seen from the eyebrows.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan looked at the handsome male who was half a head taller than himself. After a psychological struggle, he said, \u201cHow are you so tall?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong smiled at the man in front of him and stated, \u201cVice-Captain Bai hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The young boy who just debuted who angered the calm and gentle vice-captain\u2026 Everyone in the league knew that Xie Shurong had offended Bai Xuan but Xie Shurong believed that Bai Xuan didn\u2019t really hate him.</p><br/><p>That year, one person was the rookie of the Flying Feathers team and the other was the vice-captain of the FTD team. Their positions were different but anyone who stood on the court had to bee ready to die. Sports were cruel and no one would show mercy.</p><br/><p>People who thought that Bai Xuan was resentful about being killed in the arena was just underestimating Bai Xuan. He was just joking.</p><br/><p>Time passed and in the blink of an eye, it was three years later. Now Xie Shurong saw him again and found that he was still the same as the memories. His skin was fair, his appearance was delicate and his smile was very gentle\u2026</p><br/><p>He was a very good person.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong couldn\u2019t help smiling at Bai Xuan\u2019s clear eyes and handed something over. \u201cI will give this to you to make amends.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan received the gift and asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is a Miracle global limited edition commemorative bookmark.\u201d Xie Shurong explained. \u201cIt is an angel race, just like your character.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once the delicate wooden box was opened, a brand new metal bookmark was revealed. It showed an angel male priest wearing white robes dotted with silver and a pair of white wings. It looked exactly the same as Bai Xuan\u2019s game image.</p><br/><p>This realistic metal bookmark was a limited edition item released for Miracle\u2019s third anniversary. There were only 1,000 copies in the world and was popular in recent years. There were many cheap imitations on the market but this one was the real thing. Not only did it change into a beautiful colour in the sun, it also had the code and collection certificate officially printed by Miracle.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan hadn\u2019t expected Xie Shurong to be very careful and actually brought such a precious gift.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan couldn\u2019t help feeling happy. \u201cI always wanted to buy this but it was unfortunately a global limited edition. I couldn\u2019t buy it domestically.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI happened to arrive in the United States three years ago and bought it.\u201d Xie Shurong said. \u201cI remembered that you like to collect things and brought it over.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d Bai Xuan loved this gift and bowed his head to study it seriously.</p><br/><p>\u201cA\u2019Shu is here?\u201d Li Cangyu heard movement from the door and popped his head out. \u201cYou brought a gift for Bai Xuan but not for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I have a gift for Cat God.\u201d Xie Shurong took a contract out of his briefcase and handed it to Li Cangyu.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was puzzled. \u201cWhat do you mean by this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have decided to join your team.\u201d Xie Shurong looked up and smiled. \u201cI think this should be a good gift, right?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

However, many players weren\u2019t willing to do interviews since they wanted to rest for a few days. Since the players had been playing for so long and were exhausted by the matches, Chairman Nan Jiangang declined the reporters\u2019 request to interview everyone and found two representatives.</p><br/><p>The representatives were naturally Captain Li Cangyu and Vice-Captain Ling Xuefeng.</p><br/><p>Chairman Nan smiled and said, \u201cSome players aren\u2019t talkative in front of reporters and some are unwilling to show up. Therefore, the difficult task of the interviews will be handed to you and Xuefeng.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu reluctantly had to promise. He turned to the hotel and sat on the sofa while rubbing his temples. \u201cThe chairman asked us to go for an interview tomorrow. The questions that could be answered have already been answered. I don\u2019t know what the reporters want us to say.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho told us to be the captain and vice-captain?\u201d Ling Xuefeng walked over and helped massage his shoulders, whispering, \u201cIt will only be busy for the next day days. Then I will accompany you to go on a holiday after returning to China.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, the holiday period is relatively long and we can relax.\u201d Li Cangyu\u2019s modd was obviously much better. He looked back at Ling Xuefeng and wondered, \u201cWhere do you want to go for the holiday?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou decide.\u201d Ling Xuefeng\u2019s voice was very gentle.</p><br/><p>He was usually cold and serious. In particular, everyone in the Wind Colour team had to listen to their captain\u2019s orders. As a result, in front of Li Cangyu, he always gave up on making decisions. Maybe it was because he was a captain outside and a wife at home? Li Cangyu had this thought and couldn\u2019t help smiling. He questioned in a calm voice, \u201cXuefeng, shall I take you on a honeymoon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood.\u201d LIng Xuefeng\u2019s lips curved slightly and his eyes were bright. \u201cWhere do you want to go on the honeymoon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about going to the Maldives?\u201d Li Cangyu opened his phone with excitement and searched for a photo of the Maldives, pointing to the blue sky and sea in the photo. \u201cAfter all, it is a legendary honeymoon place and the scenery should be good. We are both tired from playing the game so how about going on a romantic trip?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng nodde.d \u201cYes, shall we go by ourselves?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, I don\u2019t want to report to a tour group. Too many light bulbs are boring.\u201d Li Cangyu lened over and gently kissed Ling Xuefeng. \u201cWe will go just the two of us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng saw the expression on this man\u2019s face and really wanted to throw him on the sofa. However, considering there was an interview tomorrow, Ling Xuefeng had to take a deep breath and suppress the urges of his body. He gently touched this person\u2019s cheek and said, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll check the route and tickets. If you are tired then sleep first. We have to attend the press conference in the morning.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, then I\u2019ll sleep first.\u201d Li Cangyu lay down on the bed and watched Ling Xuefeng sitting in front of the laptop and carefully checking tickets, causing Li Cangyu\u2019s heart to warm. It was really a blessing to find such a powerful and considerate wife.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The next morning, the two people got up early and prepared for the interview with the media.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng usually wore a suit when attending formal events. He was tall and had long legs. Whenever he wore a suit, he looked like a cover model in a magazine. His exquisite facial features gave a sense of abstinence and many fans were excited just looking at his face.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu usually liked to wear loose and comfortable casual wear. However, today he wore a suit in order to match Ling Xuefeng. Coincidentally, his clothes were the same colour as Ling Xuefeng\u2019s suit.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng apparently discovered this. He came over to Li Cangyu and examined it carefully. Then he leaned over and whispered in Li Cangyu\u2019s ears, \u201cDid you specifically prepare a couple\u2019s outfit with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu didn\u2019t deny it and nodded calmly. \u201cDon\u2019t you think this is perfect?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng smiled and hugged the straightforward big cat. \u201cIt is a perfect match.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them met Tan Shitian and Cheng Wei at the restaurant downstairs. It was only Xiao Cheng who would run downstairs to eat breakfast so early. IT turned out that today\u2019s hotel buffet had many special snacks. Tan Shitian smiled and greeted them politely while Cheng Wei put down the cake in his hand and ran to Li Cangyu. \u201cCat God, you\u2019re so handsome today! Isn\u2019t this like going to a wedding?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian immediately pulled back Cheng Wei and smiled. \u201cCough, Cat God and Captain Ling are going to the press conference, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei only just realized and grinned. \u201cOh, the chairman made you face the reporters again. Cat God, refuel!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu and Ling sat at the next table to eat breakfast before going to the conference room on the third floor of the hotel.</p><br/><p>They pushed open the door and were immediately greeted with flashing lights. The venue was full of heads, including some foreign reporters. It was obvious that the scale of this press conference was very large but Li Cangyu and Ling Xuefeng had long been used to such a scene. The two of them exchanged a look before walking forward.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu wore a suit and was handsome and compelling when he smiled. Ling Xuefeng looked cold and his suit was steady and restrained. The two men with different styles stood together and coordinated very well. In particular, today\u2019s clothes matched each other.</p><br/><p>The reporters saw the two people and clapped. After the warm applause, the host signalled for the interview to start. A girl stood up excitedly and asked, \u201cI noticed that the clothes worn by the two great gods today are of the same style. Did you buy it together?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu replied, \u201cI bought it previously when I was in China. I rarely wear suits but Xuefeng is so formal today that I have to cooperate with him. Otherwise, it will be too strange when we stand together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng heard this and glanced over at him with a slight smile. \u201cYou are very handsome in formal clothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>The brief exchange made the atmosphere warm and the reporters couldn\u2019t help agreeing, \u201cCat God is really handsome!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201dCan\u2019t he go directly to a wedding like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>A photographer took a close-up photo of the two people. After a closer look, he was surprised to find that the two men sitting together in formal clothing looked like the photo ID of a marriage certificate. Of course, the photographer immediately got rid of the strange idea that popped up and pointed his camera again.</p><br/><p>The reporters\u2019 questions also entered the right track. \u201cCat God, your leadership has contributed to this national team winning the World Competition. Now that you have won, what do you want to tell everyone?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu picked up the microphone and smiled. \u201cI am the captain and my only credit is in arranging the lineup and organizing the tactical training. The most important thing is the players of the national team. The players have a very high overall level and everyone worked together to play every game. Each step was practical and we deserved to win this World Competition. The most gratifying thing is that we lived up to the expectations of the audience.\u201d</p><br/><p>The people clapped warmly. Obviously, many reporters were from China and were satisfied with Li Cangyu\u2019s elegant answer. A male reporter stood up and questioned, \u201cDo you think there are any weak links in the Chinese team that needs to be improved on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. We aren\u2019t as mature as the US team and South Korean team in the use of certain tactics.\u201d Ling Xuefeng glanced over at Li Cangyu and continued, \u201cThese questions will be studied in detail after returning home.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, we have already gained the referee\u2019s perspective of every match in this World Competition and they will be the focus of the major teams after returning home.\u201d Li Cangyu continued on from Ling Xuefeng.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe might\u2019ve won the championship but we still have to consider future competitions. We can\u2019t stand still.\u201d Ling Xuefeng stated.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu nodded. \u201cYes.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have the confidence to win the next World Competition? Will the two of you serve as leaders of the national team again?\u201d This question caused many reporters\u2019 ears to prick nervously.</p><br/><p>LI Cangyu and Ling Xuefeng shared a tacit look. Then Ling Xuefeng picked up the microphone and replied, \u201cIt isn\u2019t good to talk about next year\u2019s matters.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is too early for the next World Competition and we can\u2019t predict the future.\u201d Li Cangyu continued. \u201cAfter returning, we will first prepare for the eighth season of the domestic league. That is the most critical thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two people answered the reporters\u2019 questions one by one. Whenever a foreign reporter asked something, Ling Xuefeng would interpret for Li Cangyu. The two worked together seamlessly and quickly answered all questions.</p><br/><p>After nearly an hour of answering questions, their throats were a bit dry. Ling Xuefeng opened a bottle of water and handed it to Li Cangyu. Li Cangyu naturally took it and drank from it. At this time, someone suddenly stood up and asked, \u201cCat and Ling are both captains and you\u2019re normally busy. Do you have time to look for a girlfriend?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu put down the water bottle and asked with surprise, \u201cCan personal questions be asked?\u201d</p><br/><p>The host told him, \u201cYou can choose not to answer or it is fine if you are willing to answer.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporter anxiously spoke, \u201cMany fans hope that your personal matters can be resolved well. You can\u2019t completely ignore life events in order to play the game. Can you tell us what type of girls you like?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled slightly. \u201cIn fact, I have a lover and the current progress is very smooth. I don\u2019t want to announce their identity for the time being because I don\u2019t want too many people to bother my lover. They are also an e-sports player.\u201d</p><br/><p>The audience exclaimed and this was followed by another bombshell.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng lightly spoke, \u201cI also have a lover. We are very good, thank you for your concern.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Shortly after the press conference ended, Weibo went viral with the news that both Cat God and Captain Ling had a lover.</p><br/><p>Many people guessed who Li Cangyu\u2019s girlfriend was among the e-sports players. Most of them pointed their fingers at girls of the Red Fox team before shifting to the female players of the Dragon Song Club. A guessing game started on Li Cangyu\u2019s Weibo page.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng\u2019s Weibo also had many fan questions. Many people couldn\u2019t imagine it at all. What type of person would be worthy for Captain Ling?</p><br/><p>Weibo became a messy pot of porridge. Li Cangyu saw the comments on Ling Xuefeng\u2019s Weibo and felt some regret. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have answered the reporter\u2019s question.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. They will eventually know one day.\u201d Ling Xuefeng didn\u2019t care and gently held Li Cangyu\u2019s shoulder. \u201cAre aren\u2019t doing anything shady and besides, aren\u2019t we a good match?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu nodded earnestly. \u201cThat\u2019s true. In this world, only I am worthy of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>His confident smile was particularly dazzling and Ling Xuefeng couldn\u2019t move his eyes away. After watching for a while, Ling Xuefeng couldn\u2019t hold back and leaned down to press a kiss against this person\u2019s lips. Then he smiled and said, \u201cYes, only you.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Only you deserve me and only you know me.</p><br/><p>-Only I deserve you and only I really know you.</p><br/><p>Together, they were called a match \u2018made in heaven.\u2019 Their attitude towards this relationship was also very calm. They didn\u2019t announce it because the timing wasn\u2019t right. One day, it would be announced but as long as this person was by his side, he wouldn\u2019t be afraid no matter how difficult.</p><br/><p>It was because there was a person willing to share all joys with himself and was willing to accompany him to bear the suffering.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Upstairs, Li Cangyu and Ling Xuefeng hugged each other until three in the morning before reluctantly going to sleep.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was placed in the guest room and it would be bad if he was suddenly seen in Ling Xuefeng\u2019s room the next morning by the elders. So even if they couldn\u2019t bear to be separated, Li Cangyu went to sleep in the next room.</p><br/><p>Once they got up in the morning, Yuan Shaozhe\u2019s eyes were swollen while Li Cangyu\u2019s mouth was swollen.</p><br/><p>Yuan Shaozhe was surprised. \u201cWhat happened to your mouth?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu replied with a straight expression, \u201cLast night, I ate too many peppers and it was on fire.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t dare tell Yuan Shaozhe that it was due to Ling Xuefeng\u2019s kisses. Don\u2019t look at Ling Xuefeng\u2019s usual indifference and seriousness and how he was called the \u2018abstinent god\u2019 by fans. In the face of the person he liked, this man\u2019s enthusiasm wasn\u2019t reduced.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu washed up and turned on his phone. He found that there were countless unread text messages that were almost all New Year\u2019s greetings.</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei: [Your brainless fan coming to report at exactly 12 o\u2019clock. I wish Cat God a happy new year, good luck! I am the first, I am definitely the first. If I\u2019m not first, please delete all previous New Year\u2019s greetings. Thank you!]</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan: [Old Cat, be happy on the Spring Festival. I plan to return on the 2nd.]</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming: [I wish all team members of Canglan a happy new year. All the best and I hope your dreams come true. This is a mass thank you message!]</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong: [Cat God, I hope you have a happy Spring Festival. I haven\u2019t spent the holiday in China for a long time. It is so lively!]</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang: [Cat God, happy Spring Festival. I have been practicing the arena on my own and have become more powerful. Please give me a test when we come back!]</p><br/><p>Xiao Han: [Master, have a happy new year. I heard from Qin Mo that masters will give their apprentices a red envelope for the new year. Will I get one?]</p><br/><p>Gu Siming: [Cat God, happy new year. Our Canglan team must win the championship in the new season. Sweep the league, come on!]</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang: [Captain, happy Spring Festival.]</p><br/><p>He looked at the different styles of text messages and couldn\u2019t help smiling.</p><br/><p>The new year was a new beginning for him, whether it was feelings or his career.</p><br/><p>This was the happiest Spring Festival from childhood to the present.</p><br/><p>God gave him a lover who understood him the best and many lovely and excellent teammates. This was his greatest blessing in the new year. He would certain grasp and cherish it.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>After breakfast, Ling Xuefeng\u2019s parents and relatives packed their bags to go to their grandmother\u2019s house to celebrate the new year. Mother Ling considerately said, \u201cXuefeng, you don\u2019t have to go this year. Stay home with Xiao Li.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was a bit embarrassed. \u201cIs this okay? Won\u2019t Grandmother be angry?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng replied, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. In previous years, I have been busy and haven\u2019t gone to celebrate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu put down his worries.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng sent away his parents and turned to Li Cangyu. \u201cStaying home is boring. Do you want to go for a walk?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, this is the first time I\u2019ve been to Suzhou so you should take me around.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two men went out in thick clothes. Li Cangyu was afraid of the cold and wore a hat.</p><br/><p>Suzhou\u2019s tourist attractions were very famous in China, especially Suzhou Gardens. However, there were too many people during the Spring Festival. Ling Xuefeng didn\u2019t recommend looking at the scenery in such a crowded place. Instead he took Li Cangyu to a place he often played at when he was a child.</p><br/><p>The surrounding villages weren\u2019t as famous but there were beautiful mountains and scenery. There weren\u2019t many people, making it like a rare quiet paradise.</p><br/><p>The two men were walking next to each other when Ling Xuefeng suddenly extended his right hand, gently holding Li Cangyu\u2019s left hand.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was startled and actively held his hand.</p><br/><p>They had hugged each other a long time last night but now that they were holding hands in the daytime, Li Cangyu was particularly excited. His heartbeat was faster than when they kissed last night.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, what if a paparazzi takes photos of us?\u201d Li Cangyu asked as he looked around.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t happen.\u201d Ling Xuefeng\u2019s mouth lifted slightly. \u201cPaparazzi also have to celebrate the New Year. Besides, there is no e-sports club in Suzhou. There won\u2019t be as many e-sports reporters as there are in Shanghai.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu let go of his worries and held Ling Xuefeng\u2019s hands, their 10 fingers interlocking. His mood was great.</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t this a date?</p><br/><p>Walking hand in hand, it was very simple but warm.</p><br/><p>It felt more romantic than a TV show.</p><br/><p>Of course, unlike the TV dramas\u2026 the wife wasn\u2019t a beautiful woman but a handsome man.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu couldn\u2019t help smiling at this thought and looked over at Ling Xuefeng. \u201cIf your fans know that I am holding hands with you, will they collectively drown me with saliva?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng came close to him and asked, \u201cAre you afraid?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu waved his hand in a chic manner. \u201cWhat am I afraid of? I will tell them that the first male god in the league belongs to Old Cat alone. After watching the live broadcasts, they can\u2019t lick the screen. Captain Ling can only be licked by me. Let them be jealous.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, he moved up and kiss Ling Xuefeng on the side of the face, like a seal of confirmation. His eyes were full of pride.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng was amused by him and couldn\u2019t help pulling Li Cangyu into his arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I will be yours alone in the future.\u201d Ling Xuefeng declared.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Li Cangyu smiled in a particularly pleased manner.</p><br/><p>The two people hugged for a moment on the scenic street. The winter sun shone on their bodies. They listened to the other person\u2019s heartbeat and felt warm.</p><br/><p>After a while, Ling Xuefeng opened his arms and asked softly, \u201cDo you want to stay at my house for a few days?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu said, \u201cI booked a flight back to Changsha tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng was a bit surprised. \u201cYou are going back so early?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Li Cangyu asked curiously, \u201cWhen will the Wind Colour team gather?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will gather after the Lantern Festival. The first division starts in May so we have a lot of time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu nodded with understanding. \u201cI have juniors so I have to go back and prepare in advance.\u201d</p><br/><p>He felt very reluctant because he wanted to stay with Ling Xuefeng a few more days. But as the captain, Li Cangyu had a responsibility to bear. He couldn\u2019t set aside his teammates and dreams because he fell in love.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Ling Xuefeng understood him and didn\u2019t ask much. Instead, he said thoughtfully, \u201cYou should go back early to prepare. The second division will start on March 1st. The Canglan team only has 30 days of training time left.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was moved and held him tighter. \u201cYou truly understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng who was once again actively hugged, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Sure enough, after the confession he needed to be prepared to be caught by the big cat at any time!</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng smiled and said, \u201cThe opening ceremony of the seventh season in May, will you attend with Bai Xuan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu asked, \u201cAre you so sure that the Canglan team can make it there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have complete confidence in you.\u201d Ling Xuefeng declared. \u201cWhat is the second division? Aren\u2019t you aiming for the World Competition?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu nodded. \u201cYou truly know me the best. It is great that I have you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng found that Li Cangyu wasn\u2019t embarrassed when speaking such loving words. The strong and courageous person turned soft in front of his lover.</p><br/><p>Just then, there was a sudden \u2018click\u2019 sound. It was obviously the sound of a camera\u2019s shutter being pressed. The two of them immediately separated and looked back, seeing an approximately 20 year old girl who was panicking.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, sorry, I\u2019m sorry. I originally wanted to shoot the house and accidentally photographed you.\u201d</p><br/><p>She was alone and carrying a travel bag with a SLR around her neck. Apparently she had come out to play.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was relieved that it wasn\u2019t a paparazzi and smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Can you delete this photo?\u201d</p><br/><p>The girl immediately replied, \u201cI will delete it right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>She turned the camera around because she wanted to delete it in front of them. However, Li Cangyu looked at it and found that the scene was too beautiful\u2014sunshine, green trees, long streets and two people hugging together. The whole photo was like a soft watercolor painting, soaked in a quiet and calm atmosphere.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu suddenly felt reluctant to delete it. He saw that the girl\u2019s finger was about to press the delete button and cried out, \u201cWait, don\u2019t delete this photo. Can you send it to me after you go back? I will leave you my email address.\u201d</p><br/><p>The girl was stunned and promised to send it as she carefully wrote down the email address.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Not long after the two of them arrived home, Li Cangyu received an email with the photo from the girl, along with a message: [Sir, I sent you the photo. Rest assured, the negatives on the camera have been deleted and it won\u2019t be used for other purposes. I wish you happiness.]</p><br/><p>She was just a passing stranger but she was clearly kind and didn\u2019t make a fuss when she saw two men hugging. She left them alone and didn\u2019t pry into their private matters.</p><br/><p>This goodwill placed Li Cangyu in a pleased mood. He saved the photo and directly set it as his phone background.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng copied the photo and also set it as his phone background.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu told him, \u201cYou should take care of your phone. Don\u2019t let it be seen by people in your team!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng nodded. \u201cYes, you too.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them smiled at each other, as if they shared a secret only they knew.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>In the evening, Ling Xuefeng took the initiative to drive Li Cangyu to the airport.</p><br/><p>They arrived at the airport together. Once the security checks were passed, Li Cangyu took a few steps with his luggage. Then he suddenly turned back and gave Ling Xuefeng a hard hug. \u201cI will miss you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng\u2019s heart was really warm when he heard this.</p><br/><p>Once Li Cangyu made up his mind, he would express himself directly. He wasn\u2019t shy like many girls or introverted like some boys.</p><br/><p>He had a frank and straightforward character, treating his loved ones with the greatest sincerity.</p><br/><p>\u2018I will miss you.\u2019</p><br/><p>This was what he most wanted to say to Ling Xuefeng when saying goodbye and he didn\u2019t hesitate.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng held this person in his arms and his mood was great. He particularly liked Li Cangyu\u2019s sincerity and honesty. It was very relaxing and warm to fall in love with such a person.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng couldn\u2019t help tightening his arms as he whispered, \u201cI will also miss you. Contact me often.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, then I\u2019m going!\u201d Li Cangyu let go and waved. Then he turned around and left.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>There were too many parting scenes between them but this time was different.</p><br/><p>The two of then weren\u2019t in the same city but their hearts were closely connected.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng opened his phone and looked at the beautiful photo of the two people hugging, lips slightly raising.</p><br/><p>\u2018In the new year, we must continue to work hard. Li Cangyu, my strongest opponent, my favourite lover, I will wait for you on the stage of the World Competition.\u2019</p><br/>\n</div>"}

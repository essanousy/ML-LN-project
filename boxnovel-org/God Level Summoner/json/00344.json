Thus, the loss in the first game didn\u2019t have much impact on his mood. It was just that there was only a five minute break between the two rounds and he had to think of a method as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng bowed his head and thought about it. A moment later, Li Cangyu turned to him and asked, \u201cWhat do you think about the second game?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you thought of a way?\u201d</p><br/><p>The two men opened their mouths at almost the same time and then smiled.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu looked at him and said, \u201cThe thing I\u2019m more worried about is the third game. The US team hid their maps too deeply in the previous rounds. There are actually two maps that haven\u2019t been used. In the first game, I banned Universal Studios and if he releases it in the third game, I can no longer ban it.\u201d</p><br/><p>According to the rules, the map of a country could only be banned once per match. The same map couldn\u2019t be disabled twice, nor could it be selected twice.</p><br/><p>In other words, Li Cangyu chose to ban Universal Studios in the first game and chose Doomsday Crisis. In the third game, the US team could no longer choose Doomsday Crisis because it had been used once. Li Cangyu also couldn\u2019t ban Universal Studios because he banned it once before. This was the non-repeatable nature of maps in the same match.</p><br/><p>According to the US team\u2019s map tactics, Li Cangyu just banned Universal Studios so Noah would definitely release Universal Studios in the third game to force Li Cangyu to choose it.</p><br/><p>The Doomsday Crisis map was too pitted and it was impossible for the Universal Studios map left behind by the US team to be simple.</p><br/><p>This was what Li Cangyu was worried about. If too many gods played in the second round, it would be tough to deal with the US team at home in the third game. Regardless of the score of the first two games, the third game was crucial for both sides. Losing it would seriously affect the morale of the whole team.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng obviously knew this as well. There was a moment of silence before he said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take the second game and I take the third game?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu shook his head. \u201cThis tactical system might not necessarily win against the US team.\u201d He touched his chin and thought carefully before calling Tan Shitian over. \u201cCaptain Tan, how about you lead this game?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian was startled. \u201cMe?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was the youngest captain of the national team and Li Cangyu sending him despite the first loss was enough to prove Li Cangyu\u2019s absolute trust in him. Tan Shitian couldn\u2019t help feeling moved and he nodded seriously, \u201cI will try my best.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, don\u2019t think too much and play well.\u201d Li Cangyu patted him on the shoulder and encouraged him. \u201cThere are many opportunities for you to participate in the World Competition in the future. Just think of it as practice.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian immediately understood Li Cangyu\u2019s meaning. As the youngest captain in the league, he had the opportunity to participate in the World Competition in the next few years. For Li Cangyu, the next season might not necessarily\u2026 Thoughts flashed in Tan Shitian\u2019s head but it wasn\u2019t appropriate to ask them at this time. He forced back his doubts and nodded with a smile. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>After the break, Li Cangyu got up and went to the command post.</p><br/><p>This game was the Chinese team\u2019s home game. They had the map advantage but the problem was that the US team could disable the Chinese team\u2019s map. Four of the five Chinese maps had been revealed in the previous gap. The Eight-Trigram Array was the only one that hadn\u2019t been revealed and it was likely to be directly banned by Noah. If this was the case, the advantage would be lost because the away team could send a targeted lineup.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu chose the economic warfare mode that Tan Shitian was excellent at. The maps shown were the Mechanical City, the Eight-Trigram Array and Frost Temple.</p><br/><p>Noah didn\u2019t hesitate to ban the Eight-Trigram Array that hadn\u2019t appeared before, leaving the Mechanical City.</p><br/><p>Kou Hongyi couldn\u2019t help feeling some regret. \u201cThe new map was banned. It seems that the US team left a lot of trump cards to play in the finals, leaving two maps to force us to play both. It was truly far-sighted.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Bing stated calmly, \u201cThis can\u2019t be blamed on us. After all, we met the Korean team in the semi-finals. If we held back too many cards, it was likely that we would\u2019ve been eliminated by the South Korean team.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn other words, the US team\u2019s opponents were much weaker so they could hide many maps. According to the rules, Cat God has to choose the previously banned Universal Studios in the third game. However, if Eight-Trigram Array appears in the fourth game, the US team can\u2019t disable it anymore.\u201dKou Hongyi explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe map is just one factor that affects the game but it isn\u2019t the decisive factor. If you are lucky, you can win in away games. In the last game, our luck was really bad. Captain Su refreshed alone in the upper half and was killed by the other three. Otherwise, we could\u2019ve fought the US team head on.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Yu Bing spoke, Li Cangyu submitted the game\u2019s lineup\u2014 Tan Shitian, Lu Xiao, Cheng Wei, Yang Muzi, Yan Ruiwen and Guo Xuan.</p><br/><p>Many viewers couldn\u2019t understand it but it wasn\u2019t difficult when analyzing it carefully. Tan Shitian and Lu Xiao were the main output archers of the Time team, Yan Guo were black magician partners in the Wind Colour team while Cheng Wei and Yang Muzi were white magicians with different styles. In other words, this was a pure output lineup.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is an economic war without a healer?\u201d Yu Bing frowned slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven so, the explosive power of this lineup is very strong. The two white magicians can join hands to control the opponent while the double archers and black magicians can open up their attacks at the same time. If the opposite side doesn\u2019t have a good defense, they might be destroyed.\u201d Kou Hongyi really liked this lineup. \u201cThere is no problem with the system. An economic war can also be quick and this system is suitable for a quick fight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe US team should send a targeted lineup.\u201d Yu Bing\u2019s voice had just finished when the captain of the US team, Noah submitted the lineup. Sure enough, it targeted the Chinese team. There was one paladin, two berserkers, two swordsmen and one healer.</p><br/><p>Noah\u2019s intentions were obvious. \u2018You want to kill us in seconds? Then I\u2019ll send a pile of thick-skinned blood cows.\u2019</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu saw this lineup and appreciated Noah\u2019s layout. He hadn\u2019t dealt head on with the US captain but this person had a deep heart and meticulous tactics.</p><br/><p>After returning from the command post, Li Cangyu went to Xie Shurong and asked, \u201cAccording to your opinion, how likely is it that Captain Tan will win?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong thought about it before replying, \u201cAround 5:5. The two swordsmen are fixed partners of the ICE team. Angus was the best newcomer last season and Benjamin\u2019s level is similar to my brother. The two berserkers are old partners of the TP team. One is very fierce and the other is very stable. Winfrey\u2019s healing level is also very high.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu did his homework before the game and naturally knew the strength of the players. He nodded and asked, \u201cThere are many captains in this game but the commander should be Benjamin, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, after all, he was the captain of last year\u2019s championship team.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Xie Shurong left, the ICE team didn\u2019t win the title this year and the championship was taken away by the TP team led by Noah. However, Captain Benjamin of the ICE team, Vice-Captain Jack Josh and the best newcomer Angus, the strength of these three players couldn\u2019t be underestimated.</p><br/><p>China\u2019s Mechanical City had already been revealed and must\u2019ve been studied by the US team. The map advantage wasn\u2019t great.</p><br/><p>The Mechanical City had a structure of two floors and had been modified accordingly to suit the economic warfare. The lower level was the refresh points of the mobs and it was divided into the \u2018\u2019 four fields. There was a staircase leading to the upper floor protected by guardian beasts. After climbing up the stairs, there would be a high platform with the crystal in the middle.</p><br/><p>In other words, the upper level was almost useless in the economic war. It was only at the end where they would climb up the stairs to hit the crystal. All previous battles would be on the lower floor.</p><br/><p>According to the panoramic view of the map, it could be seen that the mobs on this map were all mechanisms that fired arrows to cause a lot of damage.</p><br/><p>Noah saw this and spoke in a low voice, \u201cOur lineup has many melee classes. Be careful when facing the wild monsters. Even if you have to give up the money of a few mobs, don\u2019t task risks for greed. Try not to be too greedy in the early stages. Don\u2019t give the Chinese team any heads, especially Tan Shitian. You absolutely can\u2019t let him get a head.\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps Tan Shitian might be a bit happy if he heard this? After all, being warned by the captain of the US team showed that Noah was very certain of Tan Shitian\u2019s personal level.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The map loading ended and the game officially began!</p><br/><p>The players on both sides refreshed on the map. Tan Shitian immediately arranged the splitting method. He and Cheng Wei were in the middle road, Lu Xiao and Yang Muzi would go to the top while Yan Guo would go down.</p><br/><p>The arrangement on the US side didn\u2019t follow the fixed partners. The paladin took a swordsman to the top road, the healer took a swordsman in the middle and the remaining two berserkers went down.</p><br/><p>In other words, the economy of the upper and middle roads would focus on the swordsman. The US team would obviously use the double swordsmen combination of the ICE team as the main attack point in the group battle.</p><br/><p>In the domestic league, the most annoying thing for Tan Shitian was to meet the swordsman Su Guangmo. It was because the swordsman\u2019s ability to advance was a great threat to the archers. The US team sent two swordsmen to clearly aim for him.</p><br/><p>However, as Li Cangyu said, he didn\u2019t need to think too much. He only needed to carefully command this game.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

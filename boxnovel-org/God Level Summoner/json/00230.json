Liu Chuan suddenly came over and hugged Li Cangyu. \u201cCongratulations! You finally got the championship and proved yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was slightly surprised. \u201cBoss, when did you come?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t greet you because I was afraid it would affect your training. It is the finals so of course I would come to the venue to watch!\u201d Liu Chuan smiled. \u201cLet\u2019s go out at night to celebrate. I will treat you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Canglan members cheered at the words!</p><br/><p>The restaurant had long been booked by Liu Chuan. Recently, the players had been eating takeaway every day in order to train. Liu Chuan was treating the players and was very bold when ordering food, creating an extremely rich table full of delicious dishes.</p><br/><p>Once the meal finished, Liu Chuan stood up and said, \u201cThis is a toast for everyone. You have worked hard this season. It wasn\u2019t easy to win. All of you are great!\u201d</p><br/><p>The group stood up and raised the wine glasses in their hands.</p><br/><p>The celebration dinner was fun as everyone ate while chatting. Li Cangyu was in a good mood and drank a few more cups. As a result, he became drunk and stumbled back to the hotel with his teammates.</p><br/><p>He woke up at noon the next day. Zhang Jueming had to shake him to wake him up. \u201cCome on, get up! There is the awards ceremony in the afternoon!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was pulled up, washed his face with cold water to wake himself up, shaved in the mirror, tidied up his hair, put on the uniform and went to the awards ceremony with his teammates.</p><br/><p>The awards ceremony was a sea of people. As all the members walked in, their ears were shocked by the screams.</p><br/><p>The Miracle awards ceremony and closing ceremony always required all teams to attend. They were many great gods around and Cheng Wei came over to excitedly grab Li Cangyu\u2019s hand. \u201cCat God, you won the championship. Congratulations!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu laughed. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The gods of the other teams congratulated him and Li Cangyu graciously accepted it.</p><br/><p>The awards ceremony soon began and the first award for an online voting award.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe most popular player in the seventh season\u2014Ling Xuefeng!\u201d</p><br/><p>This result was expected by everyone. Captain Ling always got first in the online voting and the \u2018king of popularity\u2019s throne\u2019 was very stable. He won this award for several consecutive seasons.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe most popular team of the seventh season\u2014the Time team!\u201d</p><br/><p>This was a surprise to many people since the Time team didn\u2019t enter the playoffs. It was just that Tan Shitian\u2019s fanbase was too large and as the Storytelling God, he attracted many outsiders to vote.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian walked on stage to receive the award with a gracious smile. Cheng Wei excitedly jumped and Li Cangyu patted him on the shoulder to make him sit.</p><br/><p>After the online voting, there were the performance awards.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Best Newcomer Award for the seventh season goes to\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This award was anticipated because the player who won it would become the pillar of the major teams. A panel calculated it based on the performance of the newcomers this season. It was very objective and the audience members were looking forward to it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Canglan team, Xiao Han!\u201d</p><br/><p>The name was read out and all the Canglan fans at the venue cheered!</p><br/><p>Xiao Han was stunned since he hadn\u2019t expected to win the prize. Li Cangyu smiled and patted him on the shoulder. \u201cGo and get the award.\u201d He went to the stage with a dumbfounded expression and received the award, saying, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Han, do you have anything to say about getting the Best Newcomer Award?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there anything else?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you to the team.\u201d</p><br/><p>The host, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The mixed-race teenager\u2019s Chinese wasn\u2019t great and he could only repeat his thanks. The audience laughed and expressed deep sympathy for his Chinese teacher, Qin Mo.</p><br/><p>Next was the potential award. The beautiful host smiled and said, \u201cThe Most Promising Rookie Award for the seventh season goes to\u2026 the Canglan team, Zhuo Hang!\u201d</p><br/><p>This result surprised many viewers. Xiao Han was deserving of the Best Newcomer Award but Zhuo Hang made a lot of mistakes in the first half of the seventh season. Then after thinking about it, they realized he did a good job in the second half. He particularly played very well against Ghost Spirits in the playoffs.</p><br/><p>The Most Promising Rookie Award, this showed that the judges recognized the potential of this newcomer.</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang was very excited but he spoke more fluently than Xiao Han. \u201cI could grow from a newcomer to the player I am today thanks to the captain\u2019s training and the care of my teammates. Thank you! Thank you Cat God for making me an e-sports professional. The Most Promising Rookie Award is just the beginning for me. I am still young and there will be room for improvement in the future. I will work harder!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu sat and listened to Xiao Zhuo speak fluently. He couldn\u2019t help saying to Bai Xuan, \u201cThat child\u2019s eloquence is really good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan smiled. \u201cHe must\u2019ve watched his cousin and uncle.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was estimated that he learnt many official words from Captain Su and Captain Tan.</p><br/><p>The host immediately followed with the heavyweight award. \u201cThe seventh season\u2019s MVP, the most valuable player award, goes to the Canglan team\u2019s Li Cangyu!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Canglan fans cheered wildly while the fans of other teams were envious and disliked the blue and white area. Was the awards ceremony today contracted by Canglan?</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu took the MVP award and there was also the team championship award. Cat God had never won a prize and now he was transformed into the winner of life.He got the grand prizes!</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The second runner up was Ghost Spirits, the runner up was Wind Colour and the champion was Canglan.</p><br/><p>The team trophies were naturally what professional players were most looking forward to.</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang held the third place trophy and said briefly, \u201cWe didn\u2019t win the championship this year but we will continue to work hard next season.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s expression was very cold, despite being at the awards ceremony. The best assassin of the Miracle League, the coldest captain in the league, his combination with Zhang Shaohui and the all assassins lineup meant the performance of Ghost Spirits next season was worth looking forward to.</p><br/><p>The runner up was Wind Colour and Ling Xuefeng was still very calm. He held the microphone and spoke to the supporters of Wind Colour. \u201cWind Colour is a very strong team. Every season, we will do our best to bring you the most exciting games. Our team members will never stop moving forward!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng\u2019s words were firm and reassured the Wind Colour fans.</p><br/><p>From the beginning, Wind Colour was indeed built towards being an overall strong team. In every game, Wind Colour was like a storm sweeping through the Miracle League. The Wind Colour fans had reason to believe that the team\u2019s progress will never stop!</p><br/><p>In the end, the seventh season\u2019s trophy was handed to Li Cangyu and many Canglan fans excitedly stood up.</p><br/><p>This was the first time everyone saw Li Cangyu standing on such a dazzling stage and holding the championship trophy!</p><br/><p>At this moment, everyone\u2019s eyes were focused on them.</p><br/><p>Cat God, Vice-Captain Bai, Ah Shu, Old Zhang, Xiao Han, Zhuo Hang, Gu Siming, Li Xiaojiang!</p><br/><p>The four old players took the newcomers and walked towards the podium, making people feel surprise and admiration!</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu lifted the championship trophy and his voice was straightforward and clear as it was amplified by the microphone. \u201cThe winner of the seventh season belongs to Canglan! I am grateful to those who have helped us and supported us, allowing us to get to this point. We have no regrets! Thank you!\u201d</p><br/><p>He led his teammates to bow towards the audience.</p><br/><p>Many audience members couldn\u2019t help tearing up.</p><br/><p>The controversial player Li Cangyu finally stood at the highest peak of the Miracle League and sat on his throne.</p><br/><p>After several twists and turns, the king returned and wrote an eternal legend in the Miracle League with his blood and tears.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

They saw Xiao Gu and the other members of Canglan at the door. Gu Siming saw Li Cangyu and rushed over to hug him. \u201cCat God, I haven\u2019t seen you in a long time!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Your idol is here.\u201d Li Cangyu pointed towards Ling Xuefeng. Gu Siming let go of him and looked over at Captain Ling with a smile. \u201cI have already received Captain Ling\u2019s signature.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng had nothing to say to the black fan who \u2018I like you and want to kill you.\u2019 He nodded calmly at Gu Siming.</p><br/><p>On the other side, Zhang Jueming\u2019s face was excited. \u201cThis Miracle Village is really interesting! There are so many Miracle sculptures, the street lamps are in the shape of a staff and various characters from Miracle are painted on the ground.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu told him, \u201cThe World Miracle League is very attentive to this World Competition. Once you go to the dining room, you will see Miracle images on top of the lunch boxes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang\u2019s eyes were wide as he looked around. He seemed full of curiosity about everything here. The group arrived at the dining room and saw a few Chinese team members eating. Everyone moved to greet each other.</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang saw a small snail following behind everyone else and immediately ran over in an excited manner, firmly hugging Li Xiaojiang. \u201cYou came! You should\u2019ve told me in advance. I would\u2019ve gone to pick you up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang\u2019s face was red as he stuttered, \u201cI, I was afraid to disturb, disturb your training\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang rubbed his head. \u201cNo way! We don\u2019t train 24 hours a day. We are idle at night.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang made an \u2018oh\u2019 sound. They hadn\u2019t seen each other for a long time and Zhuo Hang seemed to be taller. Li Xiaojiang was also a bit happy at being able to see his teammate.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan, Ah Shu, Qin Mo and Xiao Han also came over. They gathered at the long table to eat and Bai Xuan asked with a smile, \u201cWhich hotel are you staying in? Are you used to it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Gu replied positively, \u201cThe boss booked us a hotel close to the competition venue. We can go to watch every match at the venue!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu thought for a moment and suddenly said, \u201cOld Zhang, can you do me a favour?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming readily replied, \u201cCaptain, if you have something then tell me, there is no need to be polite.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu said, \u201cIn three days, the World Competition will begin. I will be training with Xuefeng at the Miracle Village and it is impossible to watch every match. We will be focusing on the opponents of Group B. Since you are going to watch the game, can you summarize the key players and tactical features of the other teams?\u201d</p><br/><p>This was for future considerations. In the current group stage, the Chinese team had only three opponents: Australia, Spain and Italy. They had to concentrate on dealing with these three countries. For the time being, they didn\u2019t have time to watch the matches of other teams. Zhang Jueming\u2019s tactical awareness was quite good. He was going to watch the other matches anyway. Now he could take notes so that Li Cangyu had something to work on in the later periods.</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming understood this and instantly agreed. \u201cNo problem!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Gu said, \u201cI will also help watch. My tactical level isn\u2019t high but I have some experience in the front row!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang blushed and also said, \u201cI-I will also help to record.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu patted the shoulders of the two teenagers with relief. \u201cVery good. While watching the matches and recording, you can learn from the world\u2019s masters, which is good for both of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two teenagers nodded seriously.</p><br/><p>Xiao Han asked, \u201cMaster, our first opponent is Australia? What are their standards?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu habitually ignored Xiao Han\u2019s grammar mistakes and said, \u201cIt should be among the bottom of the countries. After all, the country is small and the population is limited. There isn\u2019t a high number of e-sports players\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan added, \u201cAs fair as I know, the 22 players sent by Australia are the top four players from the different teams. No domestic trials were held and it wasn\u2019t as troublesome as us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone listened attentively.</p><br/><p>In the Chinese Miracle league, masters were as numerous as clouds. There were eight giants in the first division and a large number of reserve troops in the second division. The overall strength of their e-sports was indeed incomparable to the small countries.</p><br/><p>However, a small country that chose more than 20 people to join the World Competition wouldn\u2019t be the champions. The key was the participation! They just wanted to express their love of e-sports. This courage was worthy of respect.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu didn\u2019t look down on the Australian team, regardless of whether their actual strength was weak or strong.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Li Cangyu suddenly remembered one thing. He took a stack of documents from his briefcase and handed it to Bai Xuan and Xie Shurong. \u201cAh Shu played in the United States for several years. Bai Xuan, your major is English. The two of you are idle in the afternoon. Can you translate the information booklet sent by the league and carefully translate it to avoid any mistakes.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was enough to sense Li Cangyu\u2019s careful nature. The rules of the competition must be translated, verbatim, sentence by sentence. Otherwise, there was a chance some players wouldn\u2019t understand the rules and would commit a foul.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The afternoon was a rare free time. Zhuo Hang took Xiaojiang, Xiao Gu and Old Zhang around the Miracle Village. Xiao Han was learning grammar from Qin Mo while Bai Xuan and Xie Shurong carefully checked the rules handbook.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu and Ling Xuefeng were surfing the Internet in their dormitory when they heard a knock on the door. They thought members of the national team were coming to find them. As a result, they were shocked when they opened the door.</p><br/><p>A man and a woman was standing at the door. The boy had long hair braided in the back and seemed a bit decadent. The woman had handsome short hair and bright eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello.\u201d The female spoke in slightly less fluent English. \u201cI am Kim Yoonhee, the vice-captain of the South Korean team. This is my brother Kim Changmin. We would like to invite the Chinese team to play a friendly match this afternoon to become more familiar with the World Competition mode.\u201d</p><br/><p>She showed a very polite attitude but Li Cangyu smiled without talking. It was because he only half-understood and was feeling really anxious!</p><br/><p>The English level of the Koreans obviously wasn\u2019t the same.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Ling Xuefeng was of a high standard. He could understand the English and whispered in Li Cangyu\u2019s ears, \u201cThe South Korean team came because they want to play a friendly match.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu thought about it. \u201cLet\u2019s accept. In any case, there is nothing to do in the afternoon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng replied in English, \u201cOkay, set the time and the number of people.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Yoonhee said, \u201cThe death racing mode. We have built a room in the server. It is room 11 and the password is 89510. The time is 3 o\u2019clock in the afternoon.\u201d</p><br/><p>It looked like this two people came prepared. LI Cangyu could understand this sentence and nodded. \u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>The brother and sister turned to leave. Li Cangyu glanced at Ling Xuefeng and asked, \u201cIs it really just a friendly match?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng told him, \u201cYour appearance in the 3v3 event yesterday surprised many people. I estimate that they are trying to test the waters to look at the actual strength of the Chinese team.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu thought about it. \u201cThen should we continue?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng nodded. \u201cCall a few juniors to go. Let us look at the strength of the Korean team.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

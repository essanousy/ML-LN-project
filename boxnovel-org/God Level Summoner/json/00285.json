He loved the vast world of deserts and grasslands. In the break given to Miracle players every year, he would drive his black Land Rover to explore various places.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t bring much luggage with him but he took Yu Pingsheng every time.</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng might only stay and rest in the hotel instead of accompanying Su Guangmo to play but Su Guangmo still brought this younger brother with him. Many people in the Flying Feathers team quietly said that Vice-Captain Yu was probably the most important luggage for Captain Su.</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng was a person with a communication disorder. He didn\u2019t like talking with people and was as quiet as a ghost every day. Still, he would say a few words in front of Su Guangmo and sometimes even smile. Whenever his brother played and he didn\u2019t play, Yu Pingsheng would sit next to his brother and be a spectator.</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo protected him like a younger brother. In the Flying Feathers team, it didn\u2019t matter who provoked the captain. However, if someone made the vice-captain angry then Su Guangmo will definitely tear off his skin.</p><br/><p>The two people had been inseparable for years and their feelings were great.</p><br/><p>Thus, Kou Hongyi\u2019s words were actually true. If the Spanish team\u2019s couple wanted to give Su Yu dog food, it definitely wouldn\u2019t work!</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo had long known about the couple from Spain. He originally thought that Isabel and Flores would play in the economic battle. After all, the protection of the paladin was much stronger in a group battle. Unexpectedly, the Spanish captain sent the two players to the arena. He obviously wanted to win this game and sent an ace combination as the guard.</p><br/><p>The combination of paladin and archer was very powerful. As long as the paladin acted as protection in the front row, the archer could constantly fire cold arrows from the distance to quickly lower the opponent\u2019s blood and then find a chance to kill.</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo understood the other side\u2019s ideas and ordered in the voice channel, \u201cI will stare at the paladin. You go and play the archer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng nodded to show his understanding.</p><br/><p>The two Spanish players refreshed on Mount Huangshan Plank Road.</p><br/><p>Previously, Yu Pingsheng and his axe had split the plank road in two. The originally dangerous Mount Huangshan Plank Road had a hole in the middle and looked even more frightening.</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, Isabel was a woman who could hold flowers to propose to a man.</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t afraid of this type of terrain at all. On the contrary, her favourite thing to do was bungee jumping. Therefore, Isabel was very calm on the dangerous map and quickly walked forward as usual. Once she reached the crack in the road, she flexibly jumped towards the lower section of the plank road.</p><br/><p>Her boyfriend Flores followed in the distance and stopped at the crack in the plank road.</p><br/><p>Mount Huangshan Plank Road might have some corners but the middle part was a straight road that sloped 45 degrees. The views of both sides were very clear. Flores looked down and could see the location of the melee.</p><br/><p>\u201cHit them!\u201d Isabel spoke on the voice channel.</p><br/><p>Flores didn\u2019t hesitate and directly used Death Arrow Rain!</p><br/><p>The bow and arrows created a dense rain of arrows that shot from top to bottom. This visual effect was quite shocking and Su Guangmo and Yu Pingsheng were flooded with arrows. Yu Pingsheng\u2019s blood fell to 55% and Su Guangmo\u2019s fell to 75%.</p><br/><p>It was impossible for a melee to do anything. Su Guangmo wasn\u2019t anxious and said calmly, \u201cWait three seconds. I will control her!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng silently counted the time while following his brother.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, the moment the three seconds countdown ended, Su Guangmo jumped in front of Isabel and his sword stabbed straight out. It was the swordsman\u2019s control skill, Spirit Lock!</p><br/><p>Isabel was set in place by this sudden attack. Yu Pingsheng took the opportunity to bypass her and jumped up towards the plank road, attacking the archer in an imposing manner!</p><br/><p>Flores was a bit surprised. He thought the paladin in front of him could block the two men. He didn\u2019t expect Su Yu\u2019s cooperation to be so good. The moment the swordsman controlled the opponent, the berserker leapt forward over the crack and successfully divided the battlefield in two!</p><br/><p>Once the battlefield was split into 1v1, the couple definitely didn\u2019t have the advantage.</p><br/><p>Flores quickly calmed down and pulled up his longbow. He used Quenching Arrow to slow down Yu Pingsheng. Unexpectedly, Yu Pingsheng suddenly moved to the side and avoided this arrow!</p><br/><p>The audience members were sweating for him.</p><br/><p>The berserker was a beast and his body was the strongest among the six races. The berserker walking on the plank road always gave off the feeling that the road would collapse yet he exquisitely made a half step at the crucial moment\u2026</p><br/><p>Vice-Captain Yu\u2019s berserker might be violent but his mind was extremely delicate!</p><br/><p>This operation proved it.</p><br/><p>Flores\u2019 ice arrow deceleration plan failed and he was forced to continue shooting in an attempt to lower the other side\u2019s blood as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>\u2014Precise Shot and Shock Shot!</p><br/><p>The archer attacked from the distance and Yu Pingsheng hadn\u2019t caught up with him yet. Thus, he was forced to be hit by these two moves.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, a berserker had thick skin and these two arrows only decreased Yu Pingsheng\u2019s blood to 25%!</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng finally reached Flores and swung the axe in his hand towards the archer\u2014Storm Strike!</p><br/><p>The huge axe dance was really amazing!</p><br/><p>Flores had played against a number of berserkers in the Spanish national team but to his surprise, this YUYU\u2019s attack was the most violent one he had ever seen! It was also the most delicate he had ever seen!</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t easy to combine the wild violence of the berserker with this finesse!</p><br/><p>Flores felt admiration in his heart but his hands weren\u2019t slow. He used Flying Feather Steps to fly away from the other person. An archer\u2019s defense was really low and being slashed by the berserker hurt.</p><br/><p>Flores was very clever. He didn\u2019t go backwards and instead used Flying Feather Steps to quickly bypass Yu Pingsheng. Only then could he receive the protection of his girlfriend Isabel.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, as soon as he entered into range, Isabel opened the paladin\u2019s protection skill, Guardian\u2019s Shield!</p><br/><p>The dazzling golden light formed a shield around the archer. All attacks were absorbed by the light shield. YU Pingsheng no longer chased the other person and chased him to the break in the plank road.</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo and Isabel were facing each other. The audience discovered at this time that the extremely defensive Isabel had been beaten down to 65% by Su Guangmo\u2019s explosive skills.</p><br/><p>A paladin was truly difficult to kill but it was also hard for her attack skills to kill the opponent. The two people here were in a deadlock. Now Flores rushed over and accurately fired at Su Guangmo.</p><br/><p>\u2014Shock Shot!</p><br/><p>This was a skill that dealt a relatively large amount of damage to a single target. Su Guangmo had been fighting with Isabel and had 55% blood. After being hit by the archer\u2019s Shock Shot, his blood abruptly dropped to 35%!</p><br/><p>At this time, Su Guangmo placed a blue symbol on the mini-map.</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng nodded and placed a finger on a key.</p><br/><p>The next moment, the audience saw a very beautiful scene\u2014</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng, who was on the above plank road, suddenly jumped down and fell behind Isabel. The giant axe swept out and the most violent skill of a berseker was used\u2014Cut Through Thorns!</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo had a tacit understanding and used the swordsman\u2019s most powerful move, Light and Shadow Rotation!</p><br/><p>In an instant, the white sword and giant axe intertwined, all attacks directed at the paladin Isabel. The highly defensive paladin couldn\u2019t withstand the joint explosion of these two people and her health fell to 30%!</p><br/><p>In the distance, Flores\u2019 heart was cold and he immediately fired arrows at Su Guangmo. The second consecutive Shock Shot took Su Guangmo\u2019s life!</p><br/><p>The remaining Yu Pingsheng didn\u2019t have much blood left but his defense was higher than a swordsman. Shock Shot couldn\u2019t kill him and Flores had to consume a larger amount of blue to use Seize Life Shot!</p><br/><p>He had killed Su Yu at a very fast speed but there was no joy on the faces of the Spanish audience members.</p><br/><p>The previous scene was just too shocking.</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng and Su Guangmo suddenly merged and launched a big outburst at the same time. Even a top three paladin in the world couldn\u2019t endure it. It was obvious how fierce their attack power was when they joined hands.</p><br/><p>Isabel had been saved by her boyfriend but her heart was still pounding.</p><br/><p>She knew that Su Guangmo\u2019s level was very high but she hadn\u2019t expected his partner Yu Pingsheng to be so powerful. In addition, the tacit understanding between the two brothers was no worse than her and Flores!</p><br/><p>Flores couldn\u2019t help exclaiming, \u201cThat berserker is a master! His style seems violent but it is actually very meticulous and delicate.\u201d</p><br/><p>The use of \u2018meticulous and delicate\u2019 to describe Yu Pingsheng were truly the most appropriate words.</p><br/><p>Isabel took a deep breath and said, \u201cThere is still one more group of partners. Be careful!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then two IDs appeared on the big screen.</p><br/><p>Killer Lou, Killer Zhang.</p><br/><p>Kou Hongyi couldn\u2019t help laughing. \u201cHahaha, Spain\u2019s couple must want to cry right now? They can\u2019t send dog food to the Chinese team and are fed dog food instead! The Su Yu combination is no worse than a couple. Meanwhile, the Lou Zhang combination have been brothers for more than 10 years!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the live broadcast room, the domestic audience was also gloating. [The public display of affection should quickly die! Sending a couple to abuse single dogs, the Spanish captain is thinking too much!] [I\u2019m strongly distressed for the Spanish couple. They will be stunned by Su Yu and Lou Zhang!] [They want to feed us dog food only to be fed dog food themselves. Kou Hongyi\u2019s summary is brilliant!]</p><br/><p>Isabel saw these two IDs and felt a desire to jump from the cliff!</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t good to face this pair of assassin brothers!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

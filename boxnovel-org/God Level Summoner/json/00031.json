No one would believe it!</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng always looked cold and he felt very strong and decisive. The players barely saw him smiling. Even if Wind Colour won the championship, he would face the reporters with a serious expression. Not only did he now have a smile on his lips, his eyes were also showing a gentle emotion.</p><br/><p>Everyone, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>They must be dreaming.</p><br/><p>The guild managers and team members looked stunned.</p><br/><p>The young apprentice Qin Mo was the most dazed. He had expected his master to abuse this Braised Fish to get revenge. Shouldn\u2019t the normal script be like this? The apprentice was bullied and the master came forward to get revenge and make Love to Eat Braised Fish beg for mercy?</p><br/><p>The result was his master chatting with Braised Fish and acting very familiar with him. He completely threw away the script.</p><br/><p>Qin Mo was very puzzled but didn\u2019t dare say anything in front of his master. He could only watch silently.</p><br/><p>Yan Ruiwen, who knew the inside story, recovered first and asked with a shocked expression, \u201cCaptain Ling, this person\u2026 is he Li Cangyu?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng\u2019s expression was calm. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The elf summoner who exchanged three pets in 10 seconds and tied with Captain Ling without experiencing any loss, it really was Li Cangyu!</p><br/><p>Yan Ruiwen was stunned. \u201cHe really is returning to Miracle! By the way, what is he doing in the new district?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe should be making a new team and finding teammates.\u201d Ling Xuefeng explained.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026No wonder.\u201d Yan Ruiwen suddenly realized.</p><br/><p>Yan Ruiwen had been Ling Xuefeng\u2019s partner for many years and was very clear about Li Cangyu\u2019s position in the captain\u2019s heart. No wonder why his facial expression softened. It turned out this Love to Eat Braised Fish was the Li Cangyu he missed for three years\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng swiveled his chair around and ordered, \u201cPresident, in the future when you meet Love to Eat Braised Fish, you shouldn\u2019t provoke him. If he comes to kill you, avoid it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Popular Land Under Heaven, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Telling him to avoid a person, this wasn\u2019t in line with Wind Colour\u2019s style?</p><br/><p>Yan Ruiwen smiled, \u201cYou would be considered lucky if you could run away. This person is a great god.\u201d</p><br/><p>Popular Land Under Heaven wondered, \u201cA great god? He is at the professional level?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Ruiwen replied, \u201cHe is similar to Captain Ling\u2019s level.\u201d</p><br/><p>Popular Land Under Heaven, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Oh my god! How big of a god was this? It was similar to Captain Ling\u2019s level? No wonder why all six of them were destroyed.</p><br/><p>Qin Mo heard this and raised his head with a puzzled expression. \u201cVice-Captain, you said that his level is similar to my master?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Yan Ruiwen glanced at Ling Xuefeng and smiled. \u201cHe is Captain Ling\u2019s strongest opponent. The captain of the FTD team, Old Cat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Perhaps the members of other teams had long forgotten the name of Cat God but the people of Wind Colour could never forget.</p><br/><p>At that time, there was a question of whether Cat God or Captain Ling was the best summoner. There were dozens of posts on the summoners section of the forum. In addition, Li Cangyu and Ling Xuefeng often missed each other in the single-elimination battle. Therefore, this problem became the unsolved mystery of the Miracle League and was often discussed by fans.</p><br/><p>Later, Li Cangyu transferred games and his popularity in Miracle fell. Ling Xuefeng became the strongest summoner in the minds of many fans.</p><br/><p>However, Wind Colour knew that the person their captain most acknowledged was actually Cat God.</p><br/><p>They actually naively tried to kill Cat God!</p><br/><p>Popular Land Under Heaven found out the truth and wiped the sweat on his forehead.</p><br/><p>Killing them two times was Cat God\u2019s mercy. If he really cared about killing them, wouldn\u2019t Wind Colour experience pandemonium?</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng calmly looked at everyone and ordered, \u201cThis matter must be kept secret. Don\u2019t let the other guild or team members know, so as to not affect his development in the game.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd immediately nodded. \u201cWe understand, Captain!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng looked at his shocked apprentice. \u201cDid you record your duel?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is recorded!\u201d Footage from Miracle could be saved on the account and watched online. At the captain\u2019s question, Popular Land Under Heaven took the initiative to open the video called \u2018Qin Mo against Braised Fish.\u2019</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng carefully watched the video before turning back to Qin Mo. \u201cHe saw that you are my apprentice and gave you 30% of his blood.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mo, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It turned out that the opponent was still taking it easy? The truth was really a big blow\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng patted his apprentice\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cIn the third season of the Miracle League, very few people could win against him. Then he led his team to Wulin and learned many new tactics. His current strength will be stronger than that year. It is normal for you to lose to him so don\u2019t lose confidence.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mo finally felt better after being comforted.</p><br/><p>Love to Eat Braised Fish was actually an incredibly powerful professional god? In addition, he was on the same level as Master? A newly debuted person being abused by him\u2026 it didn\u2019t seem that shameful?</p><br/><p>Qin Mo\u2019s mood finally moved from overcast to clear as he looked at Ling Xuefeng. \u201cMaster, Cat God is leveling in the new district. Does he mean to make a team and return to the Miracle League?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Ruiwen suddenly had a question. \u201cThis is the third time he is forming a team. This team should be better than the previous two, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is natural.\u201d Ling Xuefeng had no doubts. \u201cCanglan is disbanded so he has no more pressure to take care of his good brothers. He can set up a new team according to his own ideas. With his tactical skills, the team he sets up definitely won\u2019t be weak.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Ruiwen thoughtfully touched his chin. \u201cIt seems that the eight teams in the first division will have a big shake-up next year.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng was also looking forward to this.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t help feeling excited when he thought of that man returning to the stadium.</p><br/><p>It would be good to see him again on the field!</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>In the game, Bai Xuan also quickly recognized the operator behind Popular Land Under Heaven and couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cIs this demon summoner Ling Xuefeng?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu nodded. \u201cYes, it is inevitable that he would be alerted.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu had just wanted to teach a lesson to the arrogant young boy when he first killed Qin Mo. He didn\u2019t understand Qin Mo\u2019s personality and hadn\u2019t expected the youth to suffer a severe blow. Qin Mo was broken and distracted on the arena field, causing Wind Colour to lose.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu had a bad feeling when watching the game yesterday. Qin Mo played so abnormally that Ling Xuefeng would definitely figure out the reason. Li Cangyu just hadn\u2019t expected Ling Xuefeng to really be waiting for him in front of the computer today.</p><br/><p>However, Li Cangyu felt very glad to meet this old friend.</p><br/><p>Most of the players who debuted in the first season of the Miracle Professional League had retired. When he met Ling Xuefeng in his youth, they were both summoners and there was a common language between them.</p><br/><p>In particular, Ling Xuefeng\u2019s \u2018I\u2019ll wait for you to come home\u2019 really made Li Cangyu\u2019s heart feel warm.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu had been gone for so many years. Despite never winning a trophy, there were still people in Miracle who remembered him. Someone was waiting for him to come back. He didn\u2019t need a lot of people, just one was enough.</p><br/><p>[Oh right, is your apprentice okay?] Li Cangyu thought of the pale-faced Qin Mo at the stadium and couldn\u2019t help worrying. The 16 year old Qin Mo seemed to be a seed that Ling Xuefeng was raising. Had his defeat caused a psychological shadow?</p><br/><p>[He\u2019s fine.] Ling Xuefeng replied. [He is still young and you should teach him.]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d The bullied Qin Mo couldn\u2019t say anything. He could only silently stand behind his master and hang his head.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng turned back. \u201cXiao Qin, you sit in Vice-Captain Yan\u2019s position and use the vice president\u2019s blood kin summoner account to fight with Cat God again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he typed to Li Cangyu: [This child has god potential but his mentality isn\u2019t stable enough. Can you teach him again?]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu didn\u2019t accept: [You want me to teach your apprentice? I think you are really too much. If my teachings turn him into a great god, what would happen if I meet him on the field later?]</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng: [There is a tuition fee.]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu asked curiously: [What is the tuition fee?]</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng: [Don\u2019t you like to eat fish the most? I\u2019ll make fish with pickled vegetables for you when you return home.]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was silent for a moment before he turned back and asked Bai Xuan, \u201cCan you make fish with pickled vegetables?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan replied, \u201cNo, I can only make braised fish and steamed fish.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu immediately turned back to the game. [Deal.]</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan couldn\u2019t bear it and yelled, \u201cWill you lose all principles for fish?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can eat fish but I can\u2019t eat principles,\u201d Li Cangyu replied earnestly.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Well, he had a point.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>On the Wind Colour side, everyone made complicated expressions when they saw their captain using fish to bargain with Cat God.</p><br/><p>They felt that their captain wasn\u2019t right after meeting Cat God!</p><br/><p>In addition, the captain could cook? They couldn\u2019t imagine him wearing an apron and making pickled fish with his cold face!</p><br/><p>Qin Mo also had a complicated expression. Master sent him to be abused by Cat God and also used fish as the tuition fee, wasn\u2019t this deal really cost-effective?</p><br/><p>In any case, he never dared defy Master\u2019s words and went to operate Same Boat Under Wind and Rain\u2019s account.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng commanded, \u201cCalm down and learn carefully.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Qin Mo took a deep breath and saw Love to Eat Braised Fish send him an invitation to join the team.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng saw this and asked privately: [What are you doing?]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu: [There are many guilds around and the PK is too obvious here. So we will enter the instance.]</p><br/><p>[It makes sense.] Cat was careful as always. Ling Xuefeng thought this and sent a request to join the team.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu opened the Frost Temple instance and the six people entered the instance. This way, no one outside could see what happened inside the instance.</p><br/><p>[Player Love to Eat Braised Fish, elf race, summoner class, level 40, is requesting to learn from you.]</p><br/><p>The prompt appeared on the screen and Qin Mo accepted.</p><br/><p>His master was sitting next to him with Vice-Captain Yan, Guo Xuan, Xu Feifan and the guild management watching the battle. Qin Mo was a bit nervous and didn\u2019t know what pet to summon.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu calmly summoned a water spirit and used Water Ball to control Qin Mo.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng whispered guidance from the side. \u201cThe damage of Water Ball isn\u2019t high and it will freeze you for three seconds. You can wait three seconds and then hide to avoid his follow-up big move.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Qin Mo nodded seriously.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu knew that this boy\u2019s confidence hadn\u2019t yet recovered and that his movements had to be slowed down.</p><br/><p>Once the three seconds freezing effect was over, he slowly summoned the fire spirit.</p><br/><p>Qin Mo immediately tapped the keyboard and used the general racial skill of the blood kin race, \u2018Nightfall\u2019 to enter stealth mode, smoothly escaping from Fireball.</p><br/><p>\u201cI hid!\u201d Qin Mo shouted excitedly.</p><br/><p>His face turned red after shouting. He had been so excited after hiding from the small fireball but it wasn\u2019t over.</p><br/><p>What should he do next?</p><br/><p>Qin Mo thought about it and decided to summon his blood spider. He intended to seize this opportunity to control the opponent.</p><br/><p>Once the blood kin became invisible, the summoned pet was also invisible. Qin Mo sneaked behind the elf sure and placed the blood spider\u2014success!</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng praised him, \u201cVery good. Continue to fight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mo suffered a severe blow this time and his confidence almost collapsed. He needed to slowly recover his strength. Ling Xuefeng felt very grateful that Li Cangyu was willing to cooperate to help his young apprentice.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>In front of Li Cangyu\u2019s restrained gameplay, Qin Mo lasted two minutes before losing.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t lose too directly to Qin Mo since no one would believe it. Therefore, Li Cangyu grasped the scale well. He lost a lot of blood before defeating Qin Mo, so that it looked like Qin Mo had some hope of winning.</p><br/><p>After playing this game, Qin Mo\u2019s face finally cleared and he seriously looked back at Xu Feifan. \u201cBrother Xu, I still don\u2019t have a firm grasp on the blood kin\u2019s pet cooldown times and switching to the stealth skill. Can you teach me a bit?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Feifan certainly knew that Cat God deliberately gave face to Captain Ling\u2019s little prince but he didn\u2019t dare burst the bubble. He smiled and asked, \u201cDo you want to have a match? I\u2019ll teach you slowly as we play.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mo stood up excitedly, \u201cOkay!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two people went to different computers to fight in the arena. Ling Xuefeng saw that his apprentice had left and typed in the private chat: [Thank you.]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu said: [There is no need for thanks. The pickled fish is on the account.]</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng said: [No problem. I will give you the biggest one.]</p><br/><p>Wind Colour: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What was this strange feeling of Captain Ling coaxing his cat with pickled fish? Was it an illusion?</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng ignored everyone\u2019s curious eyes and typed: [I heard that you are currently abroad? It is at your sister\u2019s house?]</p><br/><p>[Yes, my sister is on duty at the hospital so I am staying at her house.]</p><br/><p>[When are you coming back?]</p><br/><p>[I will probably stay until the end of the year.]</p><br/><p>[This October, the first Miracle World Carnival will be held. China will be sending six representatives to New York in the United States to participate in the carnival. I will come to see you then.]</p><br/><p>[There are only six spots. Will you be selected?]</p><br/><p>[Of course.]</p><br/><p>[Are you that confident?]</p><br/><p>[Yes.]</p><br/><p>He was still like this after so many years!</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu replied helplessly: [Then once you go to New York, I will invite you to my sister\u2019s house and you will make pickled fish for me.]</p><br/><p>He was still obsessed with eating fish after so many years. He truly was a cat.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng smiled and typed: [Good.]</p><br/><p>The Wind Colour group simply wanted to stop looking.</p><br/><p>\u2018Captain, how did you become so good at talking? What did you promise to Cat God? You would go to the United States to make fish with pickled vegetables\u2026 Are you going to take the pickled vegetables on the plane?\u2019</p><br/><p>The onlookers saw the two people chatting and felt like they were light bulbs peeping at the screen. Should they keep watching? Should they stop watching?</p><br/><p>Popular Land Under Heaven was scratching his head with embarrassment when he found that Vice-Captain Yan had wisely gone over to watch Qin Mo and Xu Feifan\u2019s duel. He immediately realized what he should do and took the people around him to watch the arena.</p><br/><p>Now that the Wind Colour onlookers were gone, Ling Xuefeng could continue chatting peacefully with Li Cangyu.</p><br/><p>It had been too long since they had seen each other and there were many things he wanted to say, but he didn\u2019t know how to speak.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng was silent for a moment before asking: [Is your team going smoothly?]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu replied: [It is okay.]</p><br/><p>In fact, Li Cangyu was very happy with the current progress. It had been four days since entering the new district and he already had Bai Xuan, Xie Shurong and Gu Siming, three very strong teammates. This time he had the Dragon Warriors Club behind him and Liu Chuan\u2019s appreciation and help. The progress was unexpectedly smooth.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu had a hunch that he would keep gaining powerful teammates in the new district.</p><br/><p>He had lost for so many years and it was finally time for him to reverse the situation!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

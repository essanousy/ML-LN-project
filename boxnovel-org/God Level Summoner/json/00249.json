Zhang Shaohui and Lu Xiao were successively sent off, Qin Mo taking the double kill with Xiao Han\u2019s help.</p><br/><p>This was even more powerful than many of the fixed partners.</p><br/><p>The killed Lu Xiao wrote on the public channel: [The two little princes are well matched.]</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui agreed. [Their tacit understanding is more than ours!]</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei followed up with: [Qin Mo accompanied Xiao Han to train for so long. Your understanding must be cultivated in the process of sparring.]</p><br/><p>Qin Mo noticed the messages on the screen and chose to ignore the word \u2018sparring.\u2019</p><br/><p>He was quite surprised that he could kill two great gods along with Xiao Han. Today, many combinations were temporarily set up for the arena. It seemed their understanding wasn\u2019t as good as him and Xiao Han.</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo said: [The two newcomers are very big.]</p><br/><p>Xiao Han typed on the public screen: [Thank you Captain Su. You are also very big.]</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The group laughed. Xiao Han\u2019s Chinese standard was still at the level of \u2018copying slavishly.\u2019 He didn\u2019t understand the essence of Chinese and returned other people\u2019s praise. It was estimated that only Xiao Han could do this.</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei actively came forward. [Who is the next group? Who hasn\u2019t fought?]</p><br/><p>[Me.] This was said by Tan Shitian\u2019s side account, followed by a row of smiling expressions. [Xiao Wei isn\u2019t cheering for me?]</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei didn\u2019t hesitate. [No.]</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian asked: [Don\u2019t you have any team love?]</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei: [No.]</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian smiled helplessly and got ready with Liu Xiang\u2019s side account.</p><br/><p>At this time, Xiao Han and Qin Mo had less than half their blood left. Once Tan Shitian appeared, he used the big move, Death Arrow Rain.</p><br/><p>The bow fired the overwhelming arrows and Qin Mo immediately flashed to the left. Xiao Han turned to the right and the two people moved so that Tan Shitian\u2019s group attack couldn\u2019t reach both of them at the same time.</p><br/><p>The stealth skill was on cooldown and Xiao Han couldn\u2019t go around to interfere with Tan Shitian. Tan Shitian was the furthest attacker in the league. Thanks to the advantage of his long range, he constantly used cold arrows to interfere with the two.</p><br/><p>In just one minute, Xiao Han was hit to 10% of his blood.</p><br/><p>Xiao Han would die if he was hit by one more arrow. At this moment, Qin Mo suddenly summoned his blood knight right in front of Xiao Han. Everyone saw Tan Shitian\u2019s Death Shot hit the night, allowing Xiao Han to avoid the move!</p><br/><p>The cooldown of the stealth skill finished at this and once again, the two men pressed the key simultaneously, becoming invisible in front of everyone.</p><br/><p>Xiao Han quickly circled behind Tan Shitian and used his final blue to hit Tan Shitian with a series of crits. Qin Mo also used all his pet skills.</p><br/><p>The two men joined forces and Tan Shitian\u2019s blood rapidly dropped. Fortunately, Liu Xiang didn\u2019t stay still. She used a small healing skill and stacked up Healing Language to soon fill Tan Shitian\u2019s blood.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian no longer hesitated. He used Flying Feather Steps to move quickly and used Quenching Arrow to shoot Xiao Han. This was a skill for archers to slow down the opponent and it was Tan Shitian\u2019s signature during his kiting tactics.</p><br/><p>Xiao Han couldn\u2019t catch up with him. Tan Shitian used the advantage of his long attack range to easily take care of the two little princes.</p><br/><p>Qin Mo and Xiao Han were sent off but Tan Shitian couldn\u2019t help sighing. The cooperation between these two little guys was really wonderful!</p><br/><p>Qin Mo used a skill to protect Xiao Han and Xiao Han seized the opportunity to cooperate with Qin Mo. They entered stealth and attacked at the same time, like their brain waves were synchronized. It was worthy of long-term partners, not teammates but better than teammates.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, the two little guys weren\u2019t in the same team or the MIracle League might become their world in the future. Many great gods thought this.</p><br/><p>The masters Ling Xuefeng and Li Cangyu also exchanged a tacit look.</p><br/><p>According to Qin Mo and Xiao Han\u2019s performance today, they should keep cooperating in the arena. Then Li Cangyu could safely let them appear in the arena at the World Competition.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian\u2019s blood was filled by Liu Xiang but killing the two teenagers cost him a lot of blue.</p><br/><p>Next up was the berserker combination of Yu Pingsheng and Meng Jie.</p><br/><p>Meng Jie had the nickname of Meng Jiejie (Sister Meng) in the league. She was one year older than the Red Fox captain Liu Xiang. She had the character of a northeast sister and have a lively manner of speaking. Her style when playing a berserker could be described in one word\u2014fierce!</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng was gentle and quiet as a ghost. A person with a communication disorder seemed a far cry from the berserker class but his berserker was fierce!</p><br/><p>Two fierce berserkers acted together, it was simple the peak of the melee flow. As soon as they met the opponents, they would chase to cut them!</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian was chased by the two players and his scalp was numb. Liu Xiang was also under great pressure.</p><br/><p>This might be the first time Yu Pingsheng and Meng Jie were cooperating but players of the same class were familiar with each other\u2019s skills. The two people also had similar styles so it was easy to keep up with the rhythm of the other party.</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng used Mountain Chop the moment Tan Shitian stepped back. Then Meng Jie followed up with Splitting Bone Chop to freeze Liu Xiang in place. The two people chased Tan Shitian with their axes and the group watching had shocked expressions.</p><br/><p>[The two berserkers are terrible!]</p><br/><p>[The nightmare of fragile remotes!]</p><br/><p>[The two of them are really fierce. So many pits have been smashed into the ground\u2026]</p><br/><p>[Lighting a candle for Captain Tan.]</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian was very helpless. The most annoying thing for a ranged class was to be tangled up with a melee, especially when they were two fierce berserkers. His fragile defense couldn\u2019t stand it and Liu Xiang\u2019s blood adding could only delay things.</p><br/><p>In the final, Yu Pingsheng emptied Tan Shitian\u2019s blood and Liu Xiang was killed by the sister of the same team.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiang typed on the public screen: [Meng Jie isn\u2019t showing me any affection?]</p><br/><p>Meng Jie said: [It is hard to kill you so I must seize the opportunity, haha!]</p><br/><p>Yang Muzi jumped forward and agreed. [Yes!]</p><br/><p>Liu Xiang, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Weren\u2019t they supposed to be good sisters for the rest of their lives?</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu looked at the cooperation between Yu Pingsheng and Meng Jie and whispered in Ling Xuefeng\u2019s ears, \u201cWhat do you think of letting them partner up in the arena?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng shook his head and replied in a low voice that only the two of them could hear. \u201cTwo berserkers move slowly and are easily controlled if they aren\u2019t careful. If they encounter a magician or summoner, they can\u2019t play at all. The Su Yu combination has more guarantees. We can considered putting Meng Jie in the melee flow team battles.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu nodded. \u201cI think so as well. They both look very fierce because they encountered an archer and a healer, a combination without many control skills. They must kneel down if they meet magicians. We can\u2019t send them to the arena.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Ruiwen sat next to them and automatically moved away. He looked straight ahead and pretended not to see anything. The two commanders whispering through the whole process and exchanging a tacit understanding, couldn\u2019t they consider the feelings of the single dog sitting next to them?</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian and Liu Xiang were eliminated and they were followed by the double hunters combination of Zhuo Hang and Jiang Xu.</p><br/><p>As Li Cangyu and Ling Xuefeng just analyzed, the shortcomings of the Yu Pingsheng and Meng Jie combination were exposed at this time. They encountered a class with many control skills and simply couldn\u2019t move.</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang placed the traps at a fast speed while Jiang Xu was a professional hunter. He placed traps one after another to make it difficult for Yu Pingsheng and Meng Jie. The two berserkers acted fiercely but they could only be controlled by the traps.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xu and Zhuo Hang\u2019s chain traps exploded and quickly sent the two berserkers away. It was followed by the last pair of partners, Guo Xuan and Yang Muzi.</p><br/><p>This combination seemed a big nondescript, the black magician and white magician combination not appearing in the regular season. To everyone\u2019s surprise, the effect of the black magician and white magician wasn\u2019t bad. The white magician was the main control while the black magician was the violent output. This had an advantage against middle-range players like Zhuo Hang and Jiang Xu.</p><br/><p>Still, this combination didn\u2019t have the force of two white magicians or two black magicians. Li Cangyu and Ling Xuefeng soon passed it. It wasn\u2019t desirable to send such a combination to the arena.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The first round of the arena lasted for nearly an hour and everyone wasn\u2019t tired at all. Instead, they became more and more excited.</p><br/><p>In the national team, everyone could try a variety of novel combinations in the arena, which wasn\u2019t possible in their own team. The reason why Li Cangyu did this was to see if they could form a stronger partnership than the fixed domestic lineup.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xu and Zhuo Hang\u2019s double hunters fit Li Cangyu\u2019s plan, Xiao Han and Qin Mo\u2019s partnership was an unexpected gain and they could consider Su Guangmo and Xie Shurong for a fast break. In addition, the combination of Yan Ruiwen and Bai Xuan, Guo Xuan and Yang Muzi, Yu Pingsheng and Meng Jie were all nagated. They weren\u2019t suitable for the World Competition.</p><br/><p>Next, Li Cangyu had everyone continue with the reorganization. This training mode made many people feel excited and not tired at all. At lunch time, they were even reluctant to leave the training room. They only reluctantly went to the hotel\u2019s dining room under Li Cangyu\u2019s urging.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng saw the excited expressions on everyone\u2019s face and couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cIt seems that your training method is useful and everyone likes it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu replied, \u201cThey are also tired from always fighting with the same partner. Changing the taste can mobilize people\u2019s enthusiasm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Ling Xuefeng nodded. \u201cA variety of strong combinations appeared in this morning\u2019s arena but there is a very strong combination that didn\u2019t appear.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was puzzled. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng pointed to the other person and then himself. \u201cUs.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was stunned before immediately smiling. He whispered in Ling Xuefeng\u2019s ear, \u201cThe two of us must be the finale\u2026 do we need to practice?\u201d</p><br/><p>A soft look appeared in Ling Xuefeng\u2019s indifferent eyes. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>The understanding between them was better than Qin Mo and Xiao Han. They didn\u2019t need to deliberately train, as long as they practiced their hand speed and tactics before a game.</p><br/><p>Both people believed that the final lineup of two summoners would bring a surprise to everyone in the World Competition.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

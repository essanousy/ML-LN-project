When Su Guangmo and Xie Shurong PKed, the two people\u2019s standards could clearly be seen. However, Awakened Magician didn\u2019t say anything or even show curiosity. He was obviously a person used to such scenes.</p><br/><p>The other person accepted the friend\u2019s application and Li Cangyu sent him a private message: [Old Zhang, the swordsman who was called Bright Moon on the Sea is very masterful and is a bit like the first captain of the Flying Feathers team, Song Yang. I think he is probably Song Yang\u2019s first apprentice, Su Guangmo. What do you think?]</p><br/><p>The other side pretended not to know, replying: [Who are Song Yang and Su Guangmo?]</p><br/><p>However, he suddenly found himself in Cat God\u2019s language trap. Didn\u2019t he admit that he was Old Zhang?</p><br/><p>Sure enough, Li Cangyu said: [Why didn\u2019t you ask about who Old Zhang is? Zhang Jueming.]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Zhang Jueming was depressed after being stripped of his mask. [Old Cat, your fishing level is becoming higher and higher!]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu laughed. [You already recognized me and Bai Xuan?]</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming touched his nose. [Cough, I was too embarrassed to greet you!]</p><br/><p>[Is it because you went into the modern leveling studio practice?]</p><br/><p>[I am the leveling boss, the boss.] Zhang Cheming corrected.</p><br/><p>[Is the boss interested in going back to the competition?] Li Cangyu asked earnestly. [I am teaming up with Bai Xuan to return to Miracle. Right now, I am short of teammates and you can help me.]</p><br/><p>[\u2026I\u2019m 26 years old.] Zhang Jueming said with embarrassment. [Isn\u2019t it too much to go back at this age?]</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming was the same age as Time\u2019s old captain Xu Luo and Flying Feathers\u2019 old captain Song Yang.</p><br/><p>In the first season, Xu Luo was only 20 years old when he led the Time team to win the championship and was young and promising. However, the same 20 year old Zhang Jueming\u2019s team experienced the tragedy of the FTD team and didn\u2019t reach the playoffs.</p><br/><p>The even more tragic thing was that his teammates weren\u2019t as determined and fierce as Li Cangyu\u2019s friends, not was there something like Bai Xuan\u2019s support as a vice-captain. Compared to Li Cangyu who was accompanied by his friends, he was fighting alone.</p><br/><p>Full Moon disbanded at the end of the first season and he wanted to go to other teams. Unfortunately, the white magician assistance style that he played was too biased. He couldn\u2019t find a team to accept him and Zhang Jueming had to leave the Miracle League.</p><br/><p>In that year, his heart had been very unwilling but as time passed, he gradually understood that the outstanding gods of Miracle, apart from their own talent and strength, they also relied on opportunities.</p><br/><p>He missed his opportunities in his best years.</p><br/><p>He wanted to go back but because he was getting older, it was hard to find a team willing to accept him.</p><br/><p>Therefore, this unwillingness was gradually buried in the bottom of his heart.</p><br/><p>Now at the age of 26, he could be regarded as an antique in the e-sports circles. Song Yang, who was the same age as him, retired to be a coach at the end of the second season. Then he left the league after the third season. Xu Luo retired in the fourth season after bringing on Tan Shitian\u2026</p><br/><p>Now it was the sixth season and the Miracle League was already a world with a new generation of players. The disciples of Captain Song and Captain Xu became the pillars of their teams and the old captains had already retired.</p><br/><p>Xiao Gu calling him \u2018uncle\u2019 truly wasn\u2019t wrong. Compared to the youngsters at 17 or 18 years old who could let out a burst of speed, he was truly an uncle. If he went back, he would just drag his teammates down.</p><br/><p>A trace of loss filled Zhang Jueming\u2019s eyes but he quickly adjusted his expression. He smiled and said: [Thank you Cat God for looking at me. However, I am very good at the studio and my income is actually okay.]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu asked: [What is your leveling studio called? Is it in Beijing?]</p><br/><p>[The rent in Beijing is too expensive. I am currently in Changsha and the studio is called Speed. Cat God, please introduce business to me!] Zhang Jueming replied.</p><br/><p>[Changsha? That\u2019s good. I will come see you on the weekend. Let\u2019s talk face to face.] Li Cangyu declared.</p><br/><p>[Haha Cat God, are you joking? Aren\u2019t you abroad?]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu said: [I can fly back.]</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming: [\u2026]</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming thought that Cat God was joking. How could he fly back so casually from abroad?</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, he opened the door early on Saturday morning and found a handsome man standing there with a small backpack. He reached out with a smile and said, \u201cHello, I am Old Cat, Li Cangyu. Do you still recognize me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming almost slipped. \u201c\u2026You really came?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man in front of him was much more mature than the 18 year old youth in his memories. He had experienced many hardships and became more powerful than before.</p><br/><p>A tall and slender figure combined with the handsome appearance, honestly personality and charming smile!</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming glanced at him and asked, \u201cDid you come straight from the airport?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Cat God did things resolutely but flying directly from abroad, wasn\u2019t this too resolute?</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, come in and sit.\u201d Zhang Jueming invited Li Cangyu into the studio.</p><br/><p>After leaving the league at the end of the first season, Zhang Jueming carefully considered his options before deciding to go to his relative\u2019s home. Life in Changsha didn\u2019t have as much pressure as Beijing. He rented a large place in the suburbs of Changsha and set up a studio. The beds in the bedroom was for sleeping while the living room was changed into a work room with over a dozen computers.</p><br/><p>A few young people were sitting in front of the computer and quickly tapping the keyboard. Apparently, business was busy.</p><br/><p>Game leveling was actually harder than being a professional player. Although professional players trained all day long, they could have rest time after a game was finished and there were many bonuses when they won a game. The end of the season also had a vacation period.</p><br/><p>Leveling wasn\u2019t the same. If there was busy, they would be busy all the time and not even earn much money\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming brought Li Cangyu to his office. It was a small study area less than 10 square metres, with a table, computer and bookcases. Zhang Jueming had a separate room as the studio owner but it still looked very humble.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is a mess but sit down.\u201d Zhang Jueming turned to pour some water for Li Cangyu.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu looked at his back and couldn\u2019t help feeling some distress. In the first season, Zhang Jueming was a captain and his eyes were full of glory. It was a pity that Full Moon disbanded very suddenly. When Li Cangyu went to find him, he was already missing.</p><br/><p>This person had the same bad opportunities as Li Cangyu. In the era of strong teams, they failed to form a strong team. The small teams they led were like tiny grains of sand mixing in with a pile of pearls.</p><br/><p>However, Li Cangyu firmly believed that from now on, this sand would eventually wash away its cover and become the most brilliant pearl in the Miracle League.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cI came to see you personally to show my sincerity.\u201d Li Cangyu stared seriously at Zhang Jueming once he turned around. \u201cOld Zhang, join my team. Captain Song and Captain Xu might\u2019ve already retired but they played outputs. You play an auxiliary so you don\u2019t need too much speed. I believe that with your awareness, you can definitely overcome the problem of falling hand speed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Zhang Jueming couldn\u2019t help feeling moved.</p><br/><p>This person came all this way to convince him to join the team. His sincerity was clearly placed in front of Zhang Jueming. Such a captain was worth trusting and following.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Cat\u2026 you are really flattering me!\u201d Zhang Jueming scratched his head. \u201cI played a white magician in the past but I actually wasn\u2019t very good. If you want to return to Miracle, you can find a better auxiliary. Isn\u2019t a psychic auxiliary popular in the world right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA psychic auxiliary does have its advantages but a white magician can also be an auxiliary. I\u2019m not being impulsive. I made this decision after careful consideration.\u201d Li Cangyu\u2019s attitude was very firm.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026 can a white magic assistant be better than a psychic?\u201d Zhang Jueming couldn\u2019t help feeling doubts. At present, many professional teams in the league didn\u2019t need auxiliary classes and those that did generally chose a psychic. A pure auxiliary profession was truly the world of psychics.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at the specific configuration of my teammates.\u201d Li Cangyu smiled confidently. \u201cOld Zhang, I\u2019m not making fun of you. At present, my team already has a healer in Bai Xuan, a swordsman in Xie Shurong and a training player Gu Siming from the Dragon Warriors training camp. If you add my summoner, the front row melee and the healer in the very rear is all full. I am missing an auxiliary so your joining will be absolutely great for us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Zhang Jueming was silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are like me, someone who has never won a trophy. Don\u2019t you want to try holding the trophy?\u201d Li Cangyu asked.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Of course he wanted to !</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re both old and this will be the last chance.\u201d Li Cangyu said, \u201cYou should consider it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to think about it!\u201d Zhang Jueming readily said, \u201cYou flew all the way back to sincerely invite me to join. I am a bad old player who will disappoint you but I should at least be worthy of your ticket money! I will return to Miracle and play on the bench. Just arrange it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Zhang was still enthusiastic and bold, deciding things neatly.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu stood up happily and said, \u201cIn that case, you should first arrange things with your studio. If it is convenient, do you want to come to the club with me and sign the contract?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is the club?\u201d Zhang Cheming questioned.</p><br/><p>\u201cChangsha, the Dragon Warriors Club.\u201d Li Cangyu replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Zhang Jueming\u2019s eyes widened with surprise. \u201cYou joined the Dragon Warriors?</p><br/><p>He had stayed in Changsha for several years and was naturally familiar with the local Dragon Warriors Club. The Dragon Warriors Club was very strong and it developed rapidly in the last few years. He didn\u2019t expect Cat God to find such a good owner. This man was really reliable.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Apart from persuading you to join the team, I came back to go to the club and discuss details of the team with the manager. If it is convenient, do you want to come with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Cheming excitedly said, \u201cIt is convenient! Of course it is convenient!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two people made a decision. Zhang Jueming first found his keys and phone before leaving with Li Cangyu.</p><br/><p>An employee saw him change clothes to go out and asked doubtfully, \u201cBoss, are you going out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming smiled and cried out, \u201cYes, Boss is going to get a trophy! Wait for me to sweep through the Miracle League. I will make a fortune and upgrade our studio to a regular leveling company! I will give you a raise!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he left with Li Cangyu while the group looked at him like he was a \u2018madman.\u2019</p><br/><p>The people in the studio silently thought in their hearts, \u2018Boss Zhang is really sick! Speaking a mouthful of nonsense, did he give up on healing?\u2019</p><br/>\n</div>"}

On the Flying Feathers side, Liu Zili was full of blood and blue. Cao Lang still had 90% blood and 85% blue despite taking two heads. Their status wasn\u2019t bad.</p><br/><p>In a matchup between masters, this blood advantage was almost negligible.</p><br/><p>However, Xie Shurong was confident that since his partner was Bai Xuan, he would be able to play with his highest strength. He couldn\u2019t let Vice-Captain Bai think he was just a braggart.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong thought this and immediately raised the sword in his hand. He used several displacement movement skills to quickly rush to the front of the Flying Feathers\u2019 swordsman Liu Zili. He directly used Breaking Bone Sword on the other person. There was a bright blue skill effect and his actions were truly domineering.</p><br/><p>Liu Zili was startled by the sudden attack.</p><br/><p>As Captain Su had analyzed before the match, Ah Shu had been playing abroad for a few years. His style was much more mature than his youth and he wasn\u2019t as impulsive as before. Why was today\u2019s Ah Shu like a mad dog? Wasn\u2019t this a bit wrong?</p><br/><p>Since Xie Shurong wanted a quick fight, Liu Zili had no choice but to deal with it.</p><br/><p>The result was that the light effects of various swordsmen skills intertwined, looking gorgeous and dazzling. At the same time, the blood volume of both people dropped rapidly.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan followed behind and wanted to add blood to Xie Shurong but Cao Lang\u2019s entanglement ability couldn\u2019t be underestimated. The assassin\u2019s stealth around the healer was very annoying. Bai Xuan\u2019s big casting was repeatedly interrupted and he had to jump back to avoid Cao Lang\u2019s attacks.</p><br/><p>Cao Lang\u2019s ability to interfere was really strong. If it wasn\u2019t for Bai Xuan\u2019s strong mind and walking skills, the healer would\u2019ve died from the assassin long ago.</p><br/><p>Bringing a healer to the arena was strong but the shortcomings was obvious. The output wasn\u2019t enough.</p><br/><p>Flying Feathers had the double output of swordsman and assassin while Canglan only had Xie Shurong as the output. If Bai Xuan couldn\u2019t add blood then the advantages of the Shu Bai combination wouldn\u2019t be fully displayed.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Xie Shurong reacted quickly. He saw that Bai Xuan was tangled up in the assassin and immediately turned from Liu Zili towards Cao Lang.</p><br/><p>At this time, Xie Shurong didn\u2019t have much blood left and it was actually quite risky. If Cao Lang and Liu Zili joined together to attack him then it was likely that he would die in seconds. Yet Xie Shurong didn\u2019t hesitate to raise his sword and rush towards Cao Lang. It was a \u2018you dare to hit my family, I will kill you\u2019 attitude.</p><br/><p>The audience were speechless and the two commentators were also stunned.</p><br/><p>After all, Xie Shurong and Liu Zili had been fighting for so long and both of them lost blood. Suddenly Ah Shu gave up his goal and went back to kill the assassin. People really couldn\u2019t understand this.</p><br/><p>Only Bai Xuan knew what was going on.</p><br/><p>Many of his healing skills were interrupted and it was impossible to form a cooperation with Xie Shurong. It was difficult to show the advantages of a healer with Cao Lang sticking to him. Xie Shurong might be able to kill Liu Zili in 10 minutes but Cao Lang was interfering with Bai Xuan, making Bai Xuan very uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong took into account the feelings of his teammate and decided to leave Liu Zili to help.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan saw the guy chasing the assassin and couldn\u2019t help smiling. He knew that the output protecting the healer was good. It might be risky but as long as the two of them connected, the advantages of a healer would constantly expand.</p><br/><p>Ah Shu had really grown. He could calmly let go of the residual blood opponent and return at a critical moment to protect the healer. This wasn\u2019t something that ordinary people could do.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan didn\u2019t hide from him this time.</p><br/><p>Previously, Bai Xuan was conditioned to hide whenever Xie Shurong came back to save him. This time Bai Xuan was troubled by Cao Lang and didn\u2019t care about the psychological shadow of being chased by Ah Shu. There was no time to hide once Ah Shu turned back.</p><br/><p>Thus, the skills of the two people formed a tacit cooperation.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan saw Xie Shurong run back to save the healer and thoughtfully gave him blood. Xie Shurong saw his blood volume rising and said with a smile, \u201cContinue. Vice-Captain Bai\u2019s blood adding is really sweet. It is like adding sugar.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Could he be more shameless?!</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan saw this person boasting and really wanted to throw him down.</p><br/><p>However, he saw Xie Shurong work hard to let out a burst of output to protect the healer and couldn\u2019t help his heart softening. He quickly added a few mouthfuls of blood to Ah Shu.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong naturally worked harder and used a set of moves to take away the blood of Liu Zili.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t take long for the swordsman and assassin sent by Flying Feathers in the second round to be killed by Xie Shurong.</p><br/><p>Once Xie Shurong killed the two people, his blood volume was quickly filled up by Bai Xuan. He proudly raised his sword and circled the map. He seemed to be saying to the audience, \u201cHey, fighting with a healer is excellent. I can be full of blood in an instant!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Xie Shurong couldn\u2019t laugh when Flying Feathers sent out their third combination.</p><br/><p>It was the ace combination of Su Guangmo and Yu Pingsheng. They were the guard combination and sure enough, Su Guangmo wasn\u2019t polite to his younger brother. He directly used the terran swordsman\u2019s big move, Light and Shadow Rotation!</p><br/><p>The white gorgeous light effect shrouded Xie Shurong\u2019s body in an instantly. Xie Shurong ran away but unfortunately, Yu Pingsheng\u2019s big axe was waiting for him. Mountain Chop!</p><br/><p>The axe fell and a deep crack formed in the ground, completely blocking Xie Shurong\u2019s escape path.</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng\u2019s axe followed closely and he used the big move Cut Through Thorns to cut Xie Shurong at the waist!</p><br/><p>The Su Yu brothers were really one of the best partners in the Miracle League. The cooperation between their moves could be called a seamless connection. Su Guangmo\u2019s style was fierce and violent while Yu Pingsheng\u2019s ability to control the field was strong. The huge and heavy axe seemed extremely flexible in his hands. He blocked all of Xie Shurong\u2019s escape paths and let Su Guangmo use his big moves.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong was very depressed after being attacked by his two brothers. He wanted to use Light and Shadow Rotation as well but unfortunately, all his big skills were on cooldown and he only had 10% blood left. Bai Xuan\u2019s blood was full but a swordsman without blue had no fighting power. He was quickly killed by his two brothers.</p><br/><p>Many viewers filled the screen with comments: [I feel bad for the little brother dying in two seconds!] [Don\u2019t be distressed little brother!]</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong had wanted to play against his brothers in a state of full blood and blue. However, this was a match and he went out in the second round, completing his captain\u2019s mission. He had no complaints about being killed now.</p><br/><p>After Xie Shurong died, Bai Xuan was inevitably pursued by Su and Yu. Bai Xuan exerted the tenacious survivability of an \u2018invincible cockroach\u2019 and flexibly moved around the big trees. He seemed to be saying to everyone, \u2018I don\u2019t want to give up.\u2019</p><br/><p>The result was that Bai Xuan stubbornly survived for half a minute under the fire of Su and Yu. He forced Yu Pingsheng to use a big move and created an advantage for the next teammates before falling to the ground.</p><br/><p>The fans of the Canglan team really liked the gentle and friendly vice-captain. They saw that he persisted so long and applauded him excitedly. The live broadcast room was filled with: [Milk God 666!] [Vice-Captain Bai is so tenacious. He must be praised!]</p><br/><p>Yu Bing also praised him. \u201cBai Xuan is truly a healer with a high survival instinct. He can last for half a minute under the combined outbreak of Su and Yu. Among the healers in the entire Miracle League, there are no more than five people who can do this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Red Fox\u2019s captain, Liu Xiang watched the live broadcast on the TV and nodded in agreement. She admired this seemingly gently but tough man.</p><br/><p>Vice-Captain Yang Muzi saw her smiling and nodding and couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cCaptain Liu, Sister Bing said that no more than five people can do this. Apart from you and Vice-Captain Bai, who else is there?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiang explained, \u201cThe main healers of Wind Colour, Time and Ghost Spirits. Their level is very high and they can survive a melee class.\u201d She paused and added, \u201cHowever, a survival ability isn\u2019t enough. The resilience and blood-adding techniques have to be fast and flexible. Vice-Captain Bai\u2019s overall level is very strong, which is why Cat God dared to put him in the arena.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Muzi asked curiously, \u201cHow is he compared to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiang smiled slightly and said, \u201cPretty much the same.\u201d</p><br/><p>Healers rarely played directly against each other on the field and there was no intuitive comparison. The key was their teammates.</p><br/><p>No matter how skilled Bai Xuan was, he wouldn\u2019t be able to go far without strong teammates. Now it was different. He had Ah Shu around him and the Shu Bai combination became an ace partnership of the Canglan team.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiang knew how rare it was for a healer to find a good partner and felt happy for Bai Xuan.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>After the Shu Bai combination exited, Canglan\u2019s third pair became the focus of everyone\u2019s attention. The names on the big screen were expected by many people\u2014Li Cangyu, Xiao Han.</p><br/><p>The master apprentice pair had appeared in the previous match. Xiao Han was a newcomer who just debuted but he knew how to cooperate with his master and keep up with his master\u2019s rhythm. Besides, this little guy\u2019s brain circuits were different from ordinary people and he never appeared tense.</p><br/><p>Xiao Han sent a text message to Qin Mo before playing: [Wait to see my wonderful performance.]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Qin Mo really didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>Every time this studious baby learnt a fresh sentence, he would repeat it several times. It was as if he discovered a new world. He had learnt this sentence from Xie Shurong and since learning it, he would say it before every game.</p><br/><p>Qin Mo was sad to discover that the whole team learnt to boast like this. How on earth was Cat God leading the team? Even the mixed-race Xiao Han was dyed black by him?</p><br/><p>Qin Mo felt like laughing and crying when he saw Xiao Han\u2019s strange text message. He felt this mixed-race boy seemed a bit\u2026 ignorant and cute?</p><br/><p>Xiao Han learnt to boast from Xie Shurong but once he arrived on the field, he found that he couldn\u2019t show a wonderful performance.</p><br/><p>In a fight between an assassin and swordsman, it was impossible to face the swordsman head on. Xiao Han could only find an opportunity to attack.</p><br/><p>However, Su Guangmo\u2019s swordsman was violent and his sword didn\u2019t show many gaps. It wasn\u2019t easy to sneak attack him. There was also Yu Pingsheng as his escort. The giant axe caused countless ditches to stop Xiao Han\u2019s movements. Xiao Han found it hard to get close to Su Guangmo to release his skills, let alone go behind the other person.</p><br/><p>The result of Xiao Han being blocked was Li Cangyu suffering under the Su Yu combination.</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo\u2019s idea was simple and crude. Kill Cat God first, regardless of the small apprentice. As long as Cat God died then there would be no suspense in them killing Xiao Han.</p><br/><p>Still, Li Cangyu wasn\u2019t easily chased. He summoned his pets and after a while, the water spirit froze Su Guangmo. Then some time passed and the wind spirit would blow away Yu Pingsheng. This scene made the audience feel very frightened!</p><br/><p>The nimble elf summoner was chased by two melee gods. Every time he was caught, he would use a control skill to escape or Flying Feather Steps to teleport. On the big screen, everyone saw Su Guangmo and Yu Pingsheng quickly chasing Cat God. Meanwhile, Cat God escaped while using his pets to control the opponent\u2026</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu could still summon his pets in an orderly manner despite being chased by two people. His frightening hand speed surprised many people.</p><br/><p>Yu Bing couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cOnce stunned by Captain Su or controlled by Vice-Captain Yu, the fragile summoner will face two melee joint attacks and the hope of living will be very small. This wouldn\u2019t be possible if it wasn\u2019t for Cat God\u2019s fast hand speed. Anyone else would\u2019ve already died.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng was in agreement with Yu Bing\u2019s words. In a match of Wind Colour and Flying Feathers, he had been chased by the Su Yu combination. He was well aware of the disadvantages of a remote summoner in close combat with a violent melee class. One positioning error meant instant death.</p><br/><p>Now Li Cangyu was being chased by the Su Yu combination while quickly summoning his pets. Ling Xuefeng was calm on the surface but he was inwardly sweating for Li Cangyu.</p><br/><p>Xiao Han obviously couldn\u2019t keep up with the rhythm. The cooperation between Su Guangmo and Yu Pingsheng was too excellent. They had been working together for many years and knew each other. Su Guangmo only had to raise a hand for Yu Pingsheng to know what he wanted. For them, the one plus one effect was much larger than two.</p><br/><p>Xiao Han\u2019s understanding with his master hadn\u2019t reached this level and his hand speed couldn\u2019t keep up.</p><br/><p>Every time he fought with Master, he was able to keep up because Master deliberately slowed down the rhythm to match out. It turned out that he wasn\u2019t strong enough to be with Master. Master was deliberately taking care of him!</p><br/><p>Xiao Han understood this and was very moved, while also somewhat depressed.</p><br/><p>He realized that when facing great gods, he would be a hindrance to Master and couldn\u2019t help\u2026</p><br/><p>The Su Yu was getting further and further away from him. Even if Master was strong, he could win one against two. Xiao Han had to do something.</p><br/><p>Xiao Han took a deep breath and calmed down. He held his mouse and carefully observed the surrounding terrain. There was a big tree to the right and Master was going over there. XIao Han\u2019s eyes brightened and he immediately went into stealth and hid there.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, it didn\u2019t take long for Li Cangyu to appear in his field of vision. The Su Yu combination were still chasing after him.</p><br/><p>Now!</p><br/><p>Xiao Han\u2019s eyes lit up and he suddenly moved. He jumped behind Su Guangmo\u2019s body and raised the dagger in his hand. The Pain Blade set Su Guangmo in place, followed by the three consecutive moves of Backstab, Soul Stab and Fatal Blow!</p><br/><p>This combination of stealth, control and outbreak was truly very beautiful, making many people feel shocked.</p><br/><p>Qin Mo watched the game on TV and couldn\u2019t help clapping. \u201cGood!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu also gave Xiao Han a thumbs up in his heart.</p><br/><p>Today he deliberately didn\u2019t guide his apprentice on what to do because he wanted to test Xiao Han\u2019s ability to respond.</p><br/><p>He played with Xiao Han in the previous match but he couldn\u2019t always protect Xiao Han. It was time for his apprentice to gain the ability to think and respond to the situation on the field.</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo and Yu Pingsheng were top gods of the Miracle League. Li Cangyu long expected that Xiao Han would feel a lot of pressure facing them. He wanted to use this opportunity to hone Xiao Han\u2019s ability to withstand pressure.</p><br/><p>As it turned out, Xiao Han didn\u2019t let him down.</p><br/><p>Xiao Han had a few seconds of emotional depression and couldn\u2019t keep up with the rhythm. However, his resilience and mentality were firm and he soon adjusted.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu had chased Xiao Han in the online game until Xiao Han was down to his underwear. Li Cangyu knew how stubborn and strong he was. Today Xiao Han proved with practical actions that he wouldn\u2019t fall easily!</p><br/><p>Most newcomers found their confidence collapsing when suppressed by great gods but not Xiao Han!</p><br/><p>He was completely lost when he couldn\u2019t fight back against Yu Pingsheng\u2019s initial control and started to doubt himself\u2026 but once he adjusted his emotions, he quickly found a chance to fight back. This was the rarest thing.</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo was too careless. He thought Xiao Han had been left behind him and couldn\u2019t keep up with the rhythm. He hadn\u2019t expected this mixed-race boy\u2019s brain to be different from ordinary people. After being thrown off, the boy actually circled around and hid behind a tree, waiting for an opportunity to move.</p><br/><p>The attack gave Su Guangmo a big surprise. Fortunately, his reaction speed was extremely fast and he wasn\u2019t controlled by Xiao Han. On the other hand, Xiao Han\u2019s appearance interrupted his cooperation with Yu Pingsheng, giving Li Cangyu time.</p><br/><p>What type of person was Li Cangyu?</p><br/><p>Just give him a chance and he would accurately seize it to kill the opponent in one breath!</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo had just left Xiao Han\u2019s dizziness control when he was hit by a gust of wind that blew him away. It was the most annoying wind spirit!</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo wanted to spit out blood!</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu used the wind spirit to completely separate Su and Yu before unleashing his hand speed. He summoned the fire spirit and successively fired Fireballs at a very fast speed towards Su Guangmo!</p><br/><p>The audience at this time discovered Cat God\u2019s carefulness. During the chasing process, he had used various small skills to decrease Su Guangmo to half blood. Combined with Xiao Han\u2019s critical hits, Su Guangmo was already in a residual blood state. Li Cangyu\u2019s full blow directly killed Su Guangmo!</p><br/><p>[Old Cat has killed Grey Wolf!]</p><br/><p>Once this prompt appeared, the spectators watching the game cheered wildly.</p><br/><p>However, the professional players watching on the TV didn\u2019t rush to clap. Su Guangmo might\u2019ve been in residual blood but Li Cangyu himself had residual blood. Li Cangyu might die the moment he was hit by Yu Pingsheng\u2019s big move!</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng naturally wasn\u2019t idle and seized this chance with his hands. The giant axe swept forward in the attack with the biggest range and highest damage for a berserker.</p><br/><p>This big move could instantly wipe out Li Cangyu\u2019s blood if it grazed him. The fragile summoned would surely be killed in an instant. The audience members held their breaths nervously.</p><br/><p>However, after the berserker\u2019s big move, there was no prompt that Cat God had died. It was because there was a rare pet in front of Li Cangyu, the guardian!</p><br/><p>This was the universal pet of the summoners. Summoners of all races could call it and the consumption of blue was very high. The cost of summoning it once was too great and Li Cangyu rarely called it.</p><br/><p>Still, it was a very important skill at a critical moment. It protected the owner and took all damage for the owner.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu used the guardian to block Yu Pingsheng\u2019s big move. At the same time, he used Flying Feather Steps to escape Yu Pingsheng\u2019s attack range, surviving in a thrilling manner!</p><br/><p>Deafening applause filled the venue.</p><br/><p>Xiao Han saw that his master survived and wittily tangled together with Yu Pingsheng. He used all types of moves as they created a two against one situation.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t a certain win situation. Li Cangyu was still in a residual blood state and Xiao Han was a fragile assassin. Yu Pingsheng\u2019s axe made him fall to residual blood while Yu Pingsheng\u2019s defense was very high. The berserker Yu Pingsheng\u2019s health was still maintained at half blood.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu reminded Xiao Han, \u201cCircle around him and interfere with his vision.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han immediately understood his master\u2019s intentions and moved around Yu Pingsheng, stabbing him from time to time. This was the role of \u2018interference.\u2019</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Xiao Han could only interfere for half a minute before Yu Pingsheng killed him with a single target attack skill.</p><br/><p>[Smog of Rain has killed Frost Descends!]</p><br/><p>The audience didn\u2019t have time to respond to this when another prompt appeared.</p><br/><p>[Old Cat has killed Smog of Rain!]</p><br/><p>Kou Hongyi looked at Yu Bing in a daze and the latter immediately said, \u201cLet\u2019s look at the slow-motion playback.\u201d</p><br/><p>The screen cut to a slow-motion replay. The audience took a closer look and discovered that Li Cangyu used Flying Feather Steps to escape because many of his pet skills were cooling down. Xiao Han\u2019s interference gave him a bit of adjustment time and the moment Xiao Han was killed, he could use a pet skill.</p><br/><p>\u2014Thunder\u2019s Wrath!</p><br/><p>It was the skill that killed Yu Pingsheng and was the big move of the thunder spirit.</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng\u2019s skill that killed Xiao Han was released at the same time and the light effects of the two skills overlapped, not allowing the audience to see it. It was only through the slow-motion replay that everyone figured out how Vice-Captain Yu was killed by Cat God. The audience was shocked by the bloody Cat God and Yu Pingsheng who collapsed in front of him.</p><br/><p>How powerful was this man? The counterattack was calculated so accurately that he was like a computer program!</p><br/><p>He survived with a trace of blood and used a last skill to kill the opponent. This type of sharp operation made people worship him.</p><br/><p>The applause at the venue was thunderous, with many audience members in the back row standing up to cheer for Cat God.</p><br/><p>In the Wind Colour training room, the sweating Ling Xuefeng finally released his fists and smiled slightly.</p><br/><p>On the Time side, Cheng Wei jumped up excitedly. \u201cHandsome handsome! Cat God is the most handsome!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian, \u201c\u2026Cough.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Bing was also obviously excited. \u201cWe can see that Cat God\u2019s blue is completely empty. He used the last of his blue to open the thunder spirit\u2019s big move and directly killed Vice-Captain Yu! Congratulations to Canglan for taking the first game!\u201d</p><br/><p>The score on the big screen became 1:0.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled slightly when he saw this score and walked back with his apprentice.</p><br/><p>He was originally prepared to lose the first game but Xiao Han was clever!</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu looked at the blond youth by his side and couldn\u2019t help patting that golden head. \u201cYou did well. Your reactions are fast enough. Continue to work hard!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han immediately nodded. \u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was his greatest blessing to meet such a master. How could he not work hard?</p><br/><p>Xiao Han returned to the rest of the team and immediately sent a text message to Qin Mo. [Master said that I did very well.]</p><br/><p>What was this feeling of seeking praise?</p><br/><p>Qin Mo smiled and replied: [Yes, you did perform very well.]</p><br/><p>Xiao Han: [Right, in addition to playing well, what other sentences are commonly used?]</p><br/><p>Qin Mo quickly replied: [Friend you are so handsome, you are great, you are amazing, let me worship you!]</p><br/><p>Xiao Han: [Thank you!]</p><br/><p>Qin Mo: [Damn! I\u2019m not praising you!]</p><br/><p>Xiao Han said: [I\u2019m thanking you for teaching me new phrases.]</p><br/><p>It was another chicken speaking with a duck situation (not understanding each other). Qin Mo didn\u2019t know if he should laugh or cry. [You\u2019re welcome. Feel free to use it. In addition, I will teach you how to boast with numbers. 6666. \u20186\u2019 and \u2018smooth\u2019 are homophones, meaning things went smoothly, very handsome.]</p><br/><p>Xiao Han suddenly realized. [No wonder why I often see 666 in the comments of the live broadcasts.]</p><br/><p>Qin Mo: [Yes, your master was really 6 just now.]</p><br/><p>Xiao Han thoughtfully put away his mobile phone and ran to Li Cangyu. He seriously watched his master and said, \u201cMaster 6666.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Young man! We advise you not to follow Qin Mo to learn Chinese!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

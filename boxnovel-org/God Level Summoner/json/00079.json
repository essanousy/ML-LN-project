Therefore, the Miracle League changed to a larger venue. The 3v3 event had one main stage and three smaller stages with comprehensive electrical equipment. This way, the matches of the four groups could be carried out simultaneously. The online broadcast could also be split into four live broadcasts.</p><br/><p>The official channel on the US side would only commentate on the important matches on the main stage. The other three stages would have live videos released and each country could select the ones they wanted to comment on.</p><br/><p>At 7 o\u2019clock, the main stage was the Group C match between South Korea team 2 and US team 1. These two teams were all strong teams with star contestants so the rating naturally wasn\u2019t bad.</p><br/><p>However, the domestic broadcast cut to the sub-game next door instead of showing the main match. The Chinese teams were playing on the sub-stages so the Chinese side would certainly broadcast their own events.</p><br/><p>In Group D, Tan Shitian, Lou Wushuang and Liu Xiang\u2019s team happened to meet in the Swedish team in the first match.</p><br/><p>Sweden\u2019s e-sports had been brilliant for some time and there were several world-class gods. It was the time when StarCraft dominated e-sports and StarCraft was more about individual players. There were many talented players who single-handedly killed famous players. Later, with the rise of team sports, there weren\u2019t as many professional players in Sweden and the size of the league was small. Their position in the e-sports circle gradually declined.</p><br/><p>At this year\u2019s Carnival, Sweden\u2019s strength wasn\u2019t high but they were nationally selected players. Their level couldn\u2019t be underestimated. Tan Shitian and the others were full of confidence but they weren\u2019t careless.</p><br/><p>After today\u2019s dinner, Tan Shitian, Lou Wushuang and Liu Xiang had gathered to discuss their tactic for the first match. They clearly had a plan so their expressions were very calm as they entered.</p><br/><p>The Carnival 3v3 group stage map was the league stipulated \u2018City Square.\u2019 This map was large in size and had a very wide view. It was the same for all matches and was fair to all teams. At the end of the quarter-finals, the matches would change into a three game, two win selection model. Competitors could freely choose a match that was beneficial to them.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>In the live broadcast room, Yu Bing started to calmly analyze the lineup of both sides. \u201cThis time, the opponent is Sweden. The Sweden team had a combination of berserker, swordsman and black magician. A berserker is the fiercest class in a melee, a swordsman has very strong attacks and a black magician has many attack spells. This combination maximizes attacks and is very violent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOur Chinese team 2 have the unmatched assassin Lou Wushuang, Tan Shitian\u2019s bard and Liu Xiang\u2019s healer. The blood kin assassin and elf bard are fragile classes with weak defense. They can be easily killed by the other side. The explosive ability and endurance aren\u2019t great but the advantage is that this combination is very mobile.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Kou Hongyi nodded with approval. \u201cTan Shitian\u2019s bard has very high agility. Combined with the elf\u2019s Flying Feather Steps, he can move through the map as rapidly as the wind. This team also has the most devastating killer in our Miracle League who is the best at assassination. The two of them are clearly aiming for the unexpected guerrilla tactic.\u201d</p><br/><p>Guerrilla warfare was one of the most common tactics in the Chinese Miracle Professional League. Tan Shitian\u2019s guerrilla tactics with the Time team had broken down many giants. However, this normally involved a cooperation between Tan Shitian and Cheng Wei. Many domestic audiences wondered what his cooperation with Lou Wushuang would be like.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The match time arrived very quickly. The players on both sides entered the competition room and confirmed the data.</p><br/><p>The Miracle World Carnival officially opened a separate game server. All players had to register their IDs after verifying their identity on the first day. Since the IDs could only be English letters, Tan Shitian used Tenday, Lou Wushuang was Killer and Liu Xiang used XX.</p><br/><p>The domestic audience could recognize these players when looking at the IDs but the Swedish players weren\u2019t familiar with them. However, the classes could clearly be distinguished based on the different avatars.</p><br/><p>The domestic audience wasn\u2019t familiar with the Swedish players so when Yu Bing and Kou Hongyi commentated, they directly used their classes instead of names. This made it easier for everyone to understand.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe captain of the Swedish team is a black magician. He is said to be a very good remote player and is also the commander of this match.\u201d Yu Bing paused and said, \u201cThe commander of the Chinese team 2 should be Tan Shitian.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian\u2019s Tenday character had a captain\u2019s mark on his head so Yu Bing could guess it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTenday, this name originated from Tan Shitian. Everyone knows that Sunday (English) is Sunday. Then what is Tenday (English)? In fact, Tenday isn\u2019t 10 days. It is our Storytelling God: Ten Days (Chinese). \u201d Kou Hongyi said with a smile.</p><br/><p>[\u2026] This cold joke made many onlookers type a row of ellipses. Yu Bing was also speechless.</p><br/><p>In order to prevent him from completely ruining the atmosphere, Yu Bing completely changed the topic. \u201cThe World Carnival\u2019s 3v3 mode isn\u2019t the same as the professional league. The contestants\u2019 data will be zero after logging into the game room. We can see that all players\u2019 stat points have been reset and the equipment has to be selected from the stadium\u2019s equipment library. This type of competition system achieves absolutely fairness between the two parties.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, the professional league is based on the strength of the contestants and there can\u2019t be a situation where a loss is due to the equipment. Both sides should have the same starting point. The equipment in the library is the same and the variety of choices is very rich.\u201d Kou Hongyi went on to say, \u201cLet\u2019s see how they choose the equipment and stat points for this match.\u201d</p><br/><p>Changing the points and equipment according to the opponent would make the match more flexible.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian\u2019s hand speed was extremely fast. In five seconds, he had added all 500 stat points into agility.</p><br/><p>Yu Bing wasn\u2019t surprised. \u201cCaptain Tan also plays with this build in the domestic league. He will add the elf bard\u2019s agility to the highest and the lack of attack will be supplemented with equipment. I guess that he will dress in an attack set.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as the words were spoke, Tan Shitian on the screen selected the \u2018Gale Suit\u2019 from the equipment library. This was the elf set with the highest physical attack, wore a crit ring and necklace and chose the Frost Covenant weapon.</p><br/><p>Kou Hongyi was a bit surprised. \u201cHe changed his weapon? In the domestic league, he always used the Elf Bow, which is the most aggressive bow. The weapon he chose today doesn\u2019t have a high attack but the advantage is that big moves will cause a deceleration effect due to the ice.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Elf Bow and Bright Heart, these were the weapons commonly used by Tan Shitian and Cheng Wei in domestic competitions. The information of these two weapons were complementary. Cheng Wei\u2019s staff had very strong control so Cheng Wei could assuredly choose the bow with the most powerful attack.</p><br/><p>Today he replaced his weapon. It was clearly because of a change in tactical thinking.</p><br/><p>Yu Bing couldn\u2019t help feeling admiration. \u201cTan Shitian is very clever. Previously, he had Cheng Wei to help him control the field. Now that isn\u2019t possible so he can only control the field himself. That\u2019s why he chose a weapon with the deceleration effect. He can take full advantage of his long attack distance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu watched the game from below the stage and couldn\u2019t help raising a thumb to Tan Shitian in his heart.</p><br/><p>On the heavyweight field of the world series, many young players would be nervous and play abnormally. This young man could be so calm and change according to the situation. It was rare for young players to react sharply and courageously. Tan Shitian was only 19 years old and to be honest, he was several times more mature than Cheng Wei, who was the same age. Cheng Wei should follow him to learn more.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>There were two minutes of preparation time before the match. The players quickly selected their equipment and added their points.</p><br/><p>Yu Bing followed the flashing images on the screen and quickly explained. \u201cThe information of Captain Lou is also released. His stats are the same as the domestic games. His clothing increase attack while his ring and necklace increases agility. The weapon chosen is\u2026 Blood Demon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBlood Demon?\u201d Kou Hongyi laughed. \u201cThis is the pair of daggers commonly used by Lou Wushuang. The black daggers have a red shine and looks beautiful. Of course, he uses the beautiful pair of daggers to kill people.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Bing cotinued saying, \u201cLiu Xiang has increased the spiritual stat. The weapon chosen is \u2018Big Angel\u2019 which increases the healing amount but her clothing is the angel race\u2019s highest defense \u2018God\u2019s Words\u2019 set. This should be Tan Shitian and Lou Wushuang\u2019s decision to help protect her life, since the opposite side would definitely come to attack her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, the opposite side is the violent attack combination of a swordsman, berserker and black magician. The situation will be better if they kill the healer and it becomes 3v2. Liu Xiang will be under a lot of pressure so she chose the defensive clothes.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Under the stage, Li Cangyu was giving a live explanation to his apprentice. \u201cYou should carefully ponder on how Lou Wushuang added the points.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han stared serious at the big screen and asked, \u201cDid he increase his attack and agility stats in the ratio of 3:1?\u201d</p><br/><p>The relieved Li Cangyu rubbed his little apprentice\u2019s head. \u201cTo be able to analyze the proportion of points from the final data, your math isn\u2019t bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han was very happy but then his expression changed. \u201cMaster, you previously told me that my method of putting all points in attack means I won\u2019t have enough agility. In fact, I put points in attack because I wanted to use my equipment to supplement my agility.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu shook his head. \u201cIt is useless to choose agility clothing without having the points to supplement it. Look at Lou Wushuang. He added points to agility. At the same time, his ring and necklace also add agility, making it easier for him to cooperate with Tan Shitian. Otherwise, his speed won\u2019t be able to keep up.\u201d After a pause, he continued, \u201cIf he was with his brother Zhang Shaohui, he wouldn\u2019t need to do this. He made adjustments to his stats based on today\u2019s teammates.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Xiao Han nodded thoughtfully.</p><br/><p>These great gods were really amazing. They could immediately adjust their stats when the teammates were changed\u2026</p><br/><p>Xiao Han had played Miracle for many years but his understanding was very shallow. He would follow his master to study in the future.</p><br/><p>Xiao Han silently made up his mind as he stared seriously at the big screen.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

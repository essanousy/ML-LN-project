They entered the room and Qin Mo carefully observed the bathroom. Then he turned back to Xiao Han and asked, \u201cThe shower room and bathtub are separate. Do you want to take a shower or a bath?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan I only choose between a shower or a bath?\u201d Xiao Han looked doubtfully at the other person.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 you can choose both. Wash yourself with the shower first and then soak in the bathtub.\u201d Qin Mo pulled him into the bathroom and patiently explained it. \u201cThis is the switch for the shower head. The hot water is on this side and the cold water is here. The faucet for the bathtub is here. Are you going to wash up now? I will help you fill it up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han glanced at him. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mo smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome. You are unfamiliar with life here and Master asked me to take care of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han hurriedly asked, \u201cWhat does it mean to be unfamiliar with life here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mo patiently explained, \u201cIn other words, you aren\u2019t familiar with the people and things here. It generally describes how a person feels when they first arrive somewhere new.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han nodded thoughtfully, \u201cThen in a known place, people are \u2018familiar with cultivated land\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mo almost spat out his saliva. Xiao Han, his strange brain circuits always created some inexplicable words. What was familiar with cultivated land? It wasn\u2019t so messy!</p><br/><p>Qin Mo had a headache at Xiao Han\u2019s series eyes. He simple explained, \u201cThere is no such saying\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han asked, \u201cThen what is the opposite of unfamiliar with life?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026\u201d Qin Mo grabbed his hair. He wanted to call his middle school language teacher and invite him over. Whenever Qin Mo met Xiao Han, he always felt that his vocabulary was far from enough to answer this person\u2019s strange questions!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou take a shower first. There isn\u2019t much time. Take a shower and go to eat dinner.\u201d Qin Mo smartly changed the topic and Xiao Han didn\u2019t keep up the pestering. He grabbed his pyjamas and brought them into the bathroom.</p><br/><p>Qin Mo consciously looked around the room as he listened to the sound of water in the shower room. His heart was a bit messy. Then he looked back and almost coughed up blood. \u2018Young man, could you lower the roller blinds when taking a shower?\u2019</p><br/><p>It was probably the first time Xiao Han had stayed in this type of hotel. He didn\u2019t notice there was a roller blind behind the transparent glass. He took off his clothes to shower, not knowing he was clearly seen by Qin Mo outside the bathroom.</p><br/><p>Qin Mo glanced away with embarrassment. A few moments later, he turned back curiously. After all, Xiao Han hadn\u2019t lowered the roller blinds so this couldn\u2019t be counted as peeking, right?</p><br/><p>Qin Mo thought this and watched Xiao Han washing up.</p><br/><p>Xiao Han was a mixed-race child with white skin. His delicate collarbone was like carefully carved white jade. His golden hair was wet and fell softly over his ears. His eyelashes were also very long. Water fell from the nozzle and looked like diamonds on his eyelashes.</p><br/><p>Compared to his usual cold self, the teenager taking a shower with his eyes closed looked a bit sexy. It was a special sexiness that came from being between a teenager and an adult. Bright water drops slid down the young man\u2019s slender body, making people unable to look away.</p><br/><p>Qin Mo saw him washing from outside the bathroom and thought that this mixed-raced child was really beautiful! The curly golden hair and long eyelashes made him look like a doll carefully crafted by the creator!</p><br/><p>Xiao Han quickly took a shower, washed away the shower gel, wiped his body with a towel and wanted to go into the bathtub to soak in the hot springs water. As a result, he happened to meet Qin Mo\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Xiao Han, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mo, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Two pairs of eyes met. Xiao Han was obviously startled while Qin Mo moved his gaze with an embarrassed expression.</p><br/><p>Xiao Han wrapped himself up in a bathrobe and asked doubtfully, \u201cDo you have something to say to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mo stuttered, \u201cN-No\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why were you looking at me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mo subconsciously replied, \u201cBecause you look good.\u201d Then he realized he was like an idiot and changed his words. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen a mixed-race person shower before so I was curious.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han replied, \u201cOh. Then continue to watch. This mixed-race is going to take a bath.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mo, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Sure enough, Xiao Han went to the bathroom, lay down in the bathtub and comfortably took a bath. He was saying, \u2018I don\u2019t mind if you look.\u2019</p><br/><p>Qin Mo didn\u2019t look, didn\u2019t look. Finally, he went to the bathroom and pretended to calmly ask, \u201cCough, tomorrow your master will definitely have everyone train in a group. Do you think he will let us be in the same group?\u201d</p><br/><p>His mouth was saying serious things but his eyes couldn\u2019t help looking at Xiao Han soaking in the water.</p><br/><p>Xiao Han didn\u2019t notice the other person\u2019s gaze and replied, \u201cHe should. After all, you are my sparring partner.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mo endured the urge to cough up blood. \u201cDo you have to keep mentioning sparring partner?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han said, \u201cWell, you are my good friend.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026That is almost the same.\u201d Qin Mo smiled with pleasure and said, \u201cThere are too many gods in the national team and we still have a lot to learn. Your master might have you train in a group with Captain Lou and Vice-Captain Zhang. After all, you re a killer and will need to cooperate with their assassination tactics.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI like Captain Lou.\u201d Xiao Han suddenly said. \u201cIt is good to train with him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Why do you like Captain Lou? Don\u2019t you like the vice-captain?\u201d Qin Mo was very curious about this. Xiao Han explained bluntly, \u201cIt is because Vice-Captain Zhang looks a bit silly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Qin Mo smiled. \u201cHis mind might be simple and he isn\u2019t careful enough. However, on the field, Zhang Shaohui\u2019s intuition is quite keen and his moves are very decisive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d Xiao Han nodded seriously., \u201cWhich player do you like the most?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is naturally my master.\u201d Qin Mo answered without hesitation. My master is calm and his hands are super fast. He often crushes his opponent in the arena, he is handsome and his popularity is first in the league.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mo\u2019s expression was full of pride but Xiao Han\u2019s words pierced it. \u201cHowever, my master won against him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Old blood choked Qin Mo\u2019s chest and it felt like he was going to have a heart attack. He suddenly discovered that not only was Xiao Han\u2019s Chinese terrible, his ability to exasperate others was absolutely first-class.</p><br/><p>He really didn\u2019t want to debate on the issue of whose master was stronger. Qin Mo swept over Xiao Han in the bathtub and he uneasily changed the topic. \u201cBy the way, how tall are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han replied, \u201cI\u2019m 176 cm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mo was happy. \u201cI\u2019m taller than you. I\u2019m 178 cm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han glanced at him with a puzzled expression, \u201cYou didn\u2019t already know? Didn\u2019t you realize you were taller than me whenever we stood next to each other?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was rare to hear Xiao Han say such a long sentence without any grammatical errors. Qin Mo coughed with embarrassment. \u201cI knew\u2026 i just wanted something to talk about.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han\u2019s lips curved at the remark. \u201cOh. If you want to talk, why not talk about how you entered the Wind Colour team?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mo sat down next to the bathtub and seriously recalled it. \u201cI used to be in the Wind Colour guild in the online game. I played with the guild masters every week in the legion defense. The president thought my level was good and called Captain Ling to come and see. I didn\u2019t know it at the time and PKed with my master. I was abused by him\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han glanced sympathetically at Qin Mo. \u201cI was also abused by my master in the online game\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The two people looked at each other and wanted to hold each other while crying. However, one person was sitting outside the bathtub and one person was bathing inside. It wasn\u2019t convenient and they could only pat each other\u2019s shoulders in encouragement.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you joined Wind Colour?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI first joined the training camp to practice my foundations for a month. Later, Master felt that my talent was good and accepted me as his apprentice.\u201d Speaking of which, Qin Mo had travelled a bit further than a lot of other players. He was discovered by the Wind Colour guild in the online game, joined the Wind Colour training camp, became LIng Xuefeng\u2019s apprentice and then debuted.</p><br/><p>Of course, he also made some mistakes when he first debuted last year. In particular, he almost lost his mind after being abused by Cat God in the online game. Fortunately, he adjusted in time and his mentality matured a lot.</p><br/><p>Xiao Han kept asking curiously, \u201cI heard that the vice-captain of Wind Colour is very good-natured?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mo nodded. \u201cYes, like your Vice-Captain Bai, Vice-Captain Yan is a very kind person. My master usually only manages the tactical arrangements of the team while Vice-Captain Yan is responsible for the daily training.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han felt thoughtful. \u201cIt seems that Wind Colour and Canglan have a lot in common.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mo smiled. \u201cYes, our captains are both summoners and the vice-captains are gentle characters. There is also a little prince.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han added, \u201cThe uniform looks like a couples outfit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mo, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han turned his head and spoke seriously, \u201cThus, after a long time, we might become the strongest opponents like our masters.\u201d</p><br/><p>After seeing the clear and bright eyes under the thick eyelashes, Qin Mo couldn\u2019t help reaching out and touching the wet blond hair. \u201cTo become the strongest opponent, you should first become better is Chinese.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han wasn\u2019t convinced. \u201cYour English is worse than my Chinese.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mo retorted, \u201cI don\u2019t have to speak English here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, you won\u2019t understand anything when you go to the United States.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mo was stunned because he suddenly felt that Xiao Han\u2019s words made sense! The World Competition was held in the United States. He wouldn\u2019t be able to understand a word when he went abroad. If he got lost then he wouldn\u2019t know how to return\u2026</p><br/><p>He would have to hug Xiao Han\u2019s thighs.</p><br/><p>Qin Mo immediately smiled at Xiao Han. \u201cThen we will learn from each other. I will teach you Chinese and you teach me English. I won\u2019t charge you tuition fees!\u201d</p><br/><p>He generously said he wouldn\u2019t charge tuition fees and wisely didn\u2019t mention that his master helped pay Xiao Han\u2019s tuition fees. Xiao Han felt this exchange was fair and said, \u201cNo problem.\u201d (Eng)</p><br/><p>Qin Mo looked dull. \u201cAh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt means no problem.\u201d Xiao Han asked him seriously, \u201cQin Mo, did you graduate from your English primary school?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Qin Mo coughed and exclaimed, \u201cI suddenly remembered something. You continue to take a bath. I am busy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han watched Qin Mo\u2019s back and felt pleased. He had previously been slandered about having rotten Chinese and now he could say that Qin Mo\u2019s English was rotten.</p><br/><p>What was this called? Evil has its retribution? Karmic retribution? Karma?</p><br/><p>Xiao Han thought about it but couldn\u2019t find the right answer. He kept thinking about it as he lay in the comfortable bath.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Outside the bathroom, the beautiful sight of the mixed-race Xiao Han bathing was still in Qin Mo\u2019s head. He took a deep breath to calm down his confused thoughts. Then he opened his phone and logged into this Q account, receiving a message: [Old Cat has invited you to join the Miracle National Team Q group.</p><br/><p>Qin Mo immediately agreed and found there were already many people in the group. Li Cangyu saw him enter and asked, [Where is Xiao Han? Isn\u2019t he logging into Q?]</p><br/><p>[He is in the bath.]</p><br/><p>[Tell him to add the group later. Also, don\u2019t forget the dinner time.] This was from Ling Xuefeng.</p><br/><p>[I know Master.] Qin Mo replied.</p><br/><p>[Everyone get ready for dinner. The time is approaching and it isn\u2019t good to eat too late.] Li Cangyu issued a reminder to @all members and immediately got their responses.</p><br/><p>Qin Mo turned to call Xiao Han, \u201cEat dinne\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t finished his words when he happened to meet Xiao Han coming out of the bathroom.</p><br/><p>Xiao Han was walking with his head down and his head hit Qin Mo\u2019s chest. He stumbled in a dizzy manner and Qin Mo hurried to grab him, helping Xiao Han rub his head. \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t see you\u2026 is it painful?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han shook his head. \u201cThere\u2019s no pain. I just have slightly low blood pressure.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen sit down and take a break.\u201d Qin Mo took him to the sofa, handing him a glass of water and a few delicately wrapped candy. \u201cDrink some water and eat some chocolate. After you rest for a bit, we will go eat dinner.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Xiao Han sipped the water and saw Qin Mo\u2019s worried expression. He couldn\u2019t help laughing, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I just took too long in the bath and my blood pressure was a bit low when I suddenly stood up. I will be fine after a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mo saw this laugh and felt his heart beat become faster. This youth always had a cold face so when he smiled, it made people\u2019s heart melt.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Xiao Gu was restless and couldn\u2019t help urging in the voice channel, \u201cCaptain, what\u2019s going on? Aren\u2019t we clearing instances today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan smiled and explained, \u201cCat God is chatting with Captain Ling.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhh? Is it Wind Colour\u2019s Captain Ling?\u201d Gu Siming was shocked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat other captain is there? It is Ling Xuefeng.\u201d Bai Xuan patiently explained.</p><br/><p>There was suddenly a loud bang from the voice channel, startling Bai Xuan. He couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cXiao Gu, what are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI fell down\u2026\u201d Gu Siming spoke excitedly, \u201cThe demon summoner is Captain Ling?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Qin Mo called him.\u201d Li Cangyu had been talking with Ling Xuefeng when he heard the voices from the voice channel. He finally remembered that several teammates were waiting for him. He explained in the voice channel, \u201cI haven\u2019t seen him for a long time so I was talking to him. I will say a few more words before continuing the instance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he typed in the team channel: [We will continue to clear Frost Temple. Xuefeng, will you go back first?]</p><br/><p>In the whole league, the only one who dared call Ling Xuefeng \u2018Xuefeng\u2019 was Li Cangyu.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng didn\u2019t mind this. On the contrary, Li Cangyu calling him this made it feel like things were more intimate between them.</p><br/><p>The guild management were still watching Qin Mo and Xu Feifan\u2019s duel. Ling Xuefeng exited the account of the vice president next to him and used the demon summoner account to type on the team channel: [I am idle so I will accompany you to clear the instance.]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu asked: [Do you remember how to clear this instance?]</p><br/><p>[I remember.]</p><br/><p>[Okay.]</p><br/><p>In any case, there was no loss in clearing several instances with Ling Xuefeng. Li Cangyu no longer asked anything and continued to walk deeper into the instance.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>This Frost Temple instance, it was very difficult six years ago when Miracle first opened. Many newcomers were repeatedly destroyed and Li Cangyu and Ling Xuefeng\u2019s first encounter was here. However, it had been many years. Miracle was updated many times and the difficulty of the low level instances were reduced overall. It wasn\u2019t as difficult as it was in the past.</p><br/><p>In addition, there were four people in the team who were professional level gods. There was also a young boy who was a professionally trained player. Playing this instance was simply, everyone sweeping through it.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng followed and carefully observed the other people in the team.</p><br/><p>These teammates were too powerful and the loss of blood wasn\u2019t serious. Therefore, the angel priest Love to Eat Twice-cooked Pork would often hide and act lazily but he never forgot to use a skill at the critical moment. This technique of filling blood was very skilled and combined with the ID, Ling Xuefeng speculated that this person should be Li Cangyu\u2019s good friend Bai Xuan.</p><br/><p>As for the beast paladin \u2018As the Name Suggests\u2019, he was very excited and madly rushed forward several times. He also died but his level of movements was good. He was flexible, had quick reactions and was a good candidate.</p><br/><p>The terran swordsman \u2018Blossoming Tree\u2019 was relatively calm, moving forward silently with the team. He obviously didn\u2019t use his full strength to clear the mobs, meaning Ling Xuefeng couldn\u2019t see his strength.</p><br/><p>It took less than 20 minutes to clear the instance, making Li Cangyu very satisfied. Ling Xuefeng was bored enough to help them clear the instance but this sped up their leveling speed by several times.</p><br/><p>After the instance, Ling Xuefeng asked privately: [These three people are your teammates?]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu\u2019s personality was straightforward and he didn\u2019t try to hide it. He said directly, [They are the players in my new team.]</p><br/><p>[The healer is Bai Xuan right? Who is this swordsman?]</p><br/><p>[Someone I met in the new district.]</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t wrong. He really did meet Xie Shurong in the new area.</p><br/><p>A\u2019Shu deliberately concealed his level because he didn\u2019t want Captain Ling to recognize him. Thus, Li Cangyu spoke casually before changing the topic. [My team\u2019s Xiao Gu is your loyal fan.]</p><br/><p>[Is that right?] Ling Xuefeng asked: [Then why is he playing a paladin? Isn\u2019t a paladin far from a summoner?]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu laughed. [Xiao Gu\u2019s thinking requires a bit of a leap.]</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng commented: [He can be seen as belonging to the radical athletes group.]</p><br/><p>There were many players in the league so there would naturally be \u2018radical\u2019. Once on the court, it was like chicken blood was injected and they would kill passionately in all directions. (TL: Injecting chicken blood was a fad in China where drawing chicken blood and then injecting it was said to make a person aggressive and as powerful as an ox.) Having the boiling blood of a wild tiger wasn\u2019t good for the paladin who was supposed to act as a shield for his teammates but Li Cangyu wasn\u2019t in a hurry. Xiao Gu wasn\u2019t fully formed yet. He was like a jade that hadn\u2019t been carved, he just needed to be polished slowly.</p><br/><p>At this time, Gu Siming excitedly expressed his appreciation of Captain Ling on the voice channel. \u201cIt is Captain Ling! Once he joined us, we cleared the instance so much faster! The skeleton infantry that he just summoned is super cute.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>How did he relate a \u2018skeleton\u2019 to \u2018cute\u2019?</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan couldn\u2019t bear it. \u201cXiao Gu, if you later encounter Captain Ling in a match, will you run over to get Captain Ling\u2019s signature?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Siming didn\u2019t hesitate to reply, \u201cNo! I will kill Captain Ling first before getting the signature.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was very satisfied. \u201cThis is the ambition of a fan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan also laughed. \u201cWell, I will continue to support your worship of Ling Xuefeng.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Was this a black fan that would come to kill you?</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu chatted with Xiao Gu on the voice channel, typed with Ling Xuefeng on the private chat window while still abusing the boss in the dungeon. Bai Xuan really admired him. This man could do three different things so easily, his brain and hand speed were really bug-like existences. (TL: Bug as in computer bug)</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng typed: [In the fifth season, Miracle changed to a first and second division league. Do you know?]</p><br/><p>[I know. I\u2019ll find a way so don\u2019t worry.] Li Cangyu spoke confidently.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng asked: [Have you found a club or are you still looking?]</p><br/><p>[I just signed with Dragon Warriors.] Li Cangyu was always very honest in front of Ling Xuefeng. He also believed that Ling Xuefeng wouldn\u2019t reveal these matters.</p><br/><p>[Dragon Warriors? Not bad.] Ling Xuefeng was very reassured by this. He had been paying attention to the league situation on the Wulin side for the past few years. He knew that Cat God creating a Miracle team in the Dragon Warriors club was the best choice.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu paused before saying: [By the way, I looked at the standings yesterday. I remember that the two teams, Ghost Spirits and Pure Cleansing weren\u2019t performing well when I left. It is incredible that they are still in the first division. Was there a substitution?]</p><br/><p>[Yes.] Ling Xuefeng patiently explained: [The two teams got a lot of new blood last year and are now filled with strong people. You should know the captain and vice-captain of Ghost Spirits. They are the Lou Zhang combination who debuted in the third season. The captain of Pure Cleansing is Zhu Qingyu, who cried after being beaten by you in the arena.]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The people mentioned by Ling Xuefeng were 17 or 18 year old junior players.</p><br/><p>The youngsters who had been beaten by him were now pillars of major teams. It was a very sudden change for the past few years.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Ling Xuefeng still remained in the Miracle League.</p><br/><p>The two people met at a simpler time and played together from the first season. They might not be teammates but they were the strongest opponents. In this familiar place, there were still many things that hadn\u2019t changed.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

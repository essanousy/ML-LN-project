The audience members were very surprised, including Yu Bing and Kou Hongyi in the commentators\u2019 room.</p><br/><p>The first game was obviously a big loss. Why not replaced him with Xiao Han or Zhuo Hang?</p><br/><p>In theory, black magic had a restraining effect. However, Li Xiaojiang reacted slowly. The other side\u2019s white magicians would control him before he could release his skills. It could be said that he played almost no role in the last game before dying.</p><br/><p>In comparison, Zhuo Hang\u2019s hand speed was faster and his traps could be used to limit the actions of the white magicians. Xiao Han could also stealth and go behind to interrupt the white magicians\u2019 casting. From Yu Bing\u2019s viewpoint, the best lineup to beat Red Fox should be replacing Zhang Jueming and Li Xiaojiang to let Zhuo Hang and Xiao Han play quickly.</p><br/><p>Kou Hongyi\u2019s tactical literacy wasn\u2019t as high as Yu Bing\u2019s but he also felt that Li Xiaojiang should be exchanged with Xiao Han. He was very puzzled about why Li Cangyu continued the same lineup in the second game.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng was the one who guessed Li Cangyu\u2019s thoughts. Li Cangyu wanted to use this opportunity to train Li Xiaojiang\u2019s ability to withstand stress.</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang himself knew that the captain wanted to give him a rare opportunity to compete with the best white magicians of the Red Fox team. When Li Cangyu had called everyone together, he specifically said to Li Xiaojiang, \u201cDon\u2019t feel too much pressure and play according to your own ideas. Focusing on Vice-Captain Yang Muzi. There is no need to worry about the other players.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang did feel a lot of pressure facing four white magicians but Cat God told him to control only one. Li Xiaojiang felt that he should be able to cope. He took a deep breath to encourage himself and went to the contestant seats with his teammates.</p><br/><p>The second game began and the Red Fox team selected a map. It was once again Ice Valley!</p><br/><p>Yu Bing immediately said, \u201cLiu Xiang continued to use the deceleration Ice Valley map. It seems that she is very confident in the players.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kou Hongyi added, \u201cThe Red Fox players must\u2019ve practiced for a long time on this map. The deceleration will greatly limit the outbreak of the two players, Xie Shurong and Li Cangyu. The second game will be difficult for Canglan. We should look at how Cat God will deal with it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu saw this map and wondered if it would be the same as the last game.</p><br/><p>It turned out that he really couldn\u2019t guess the thoughts of girls. This time Meng Jie didn\u2019t directly rush over. Instead, she took a defensive posture and the several players in the back row spread out. The healer Liu Xiang was hiding out of reach.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He put out tea and snacks and was prepared to play slowly. The result was that he was slapped as soon as he met the person. This time he was prepared to fight only for the opponents to slowly delay it?</p><br/><p>It was really tiring to play against the women!</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was forced to say, \u201cEveryone protect the healer. Xiao Li, hide behind Ah Shu and pay attention to the positioning.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two sides had a standoff at the refresh point of the white dragon. Then Vice-Captain Yang Muzi suddenly found an opportunity and accurately used God\u2019s Seal on Xie Shurong!</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong had been rapidly moving left and right to protect Li Xiaojiang. This random movement often dazzled the opponent and made it hard for them to find his direction. The surprising thing was that Yang Muzi accurately hit him!</p><br/><p>Kou Hongyi exclaimed, \u201cThis ability to control a fast moving opponent, Yang Muzi\u2019s control level is truly one of the best in the Miracle League.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Bing said, \u201cMuzi is a very ingenious player. Her role in the Red Fox team is similar to Cheng Wei\u2019s role in the Time team. She will control an opponent and then her teammates will set fire on them.\u201d</p><br/><p>She just finished speaking when the other three white magicians of Red Fox threw their attack skills towards Xie Shurong\u2019s body. Xie Shurong\u2019s blood plummeted but Bai Xuan fortunately pulled him back from the brink of death.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu frowned slightly. The players didn\u2019t seem focused enough today. It wasn\u2019t Ah Shu\u2019s fault. Yang Muzi\u2019s move hitting him was actually 50% due to luck. It was Gu Siming\u2019s reaction that made Li Cangyu somewhat disappointed.</p><br/><p>The moment that a teammate was fixed, Gu Siming was a paladin and he should immediately give his teammate Guardian\u2019s Power to alleviate the damage that Ah Shu suffered. Unfortunately, Gu Siming didn\u2019t respond because his attention was completely attracted by Red Fox\u2019s berserker.</p><br/><p>Of course, this couldn\u2019t be completely blamed on him. Him had been badly suppressed by Meng Jie in the last game so it was justifiable that he would be focused on the berserker in this game.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu didn\u2019t say anything for the moment and made on a signal on the map to attract Li Xiaojiang\u2019s attention.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiaojiang, keep up with me and hit Yang Muzi first!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang immediately nodded and started to cast the big move Dark Fear to control Vice-Captain Yang Muzi. At the same time, Li Cangyu unleashed his hand speed and summoned his water, fire, wind and thunder spirits in an attempt to use Cataclysm to stop Yang Muzi.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Red Fox\u2019s captain Liu Xiang was very clever. The moment Liu Xiang continuously summoned his pets, she suddenly used a big move on her teammates, Desperate Prayer!</p><br/><p>He saw the female angel wearing a priest\u2019s robe clasp her hands together with closed eyes. A light blue effect floating from her want to the top of her head and there was a soft holy glow that enveloped 10 metres around her. It added 50% blood to the whole team and made them immune to damage for three seconds!</p><br/><p>This was a healer\u2019s most powerful and blue consuming move. A healer would only use this at a critical moment on the field. It was because the consumption of blue was too big compared to two group healing skills.</p><br/><p>Many viewers couldn\u2019t quite understand why Liu Xiang suddenly used it at this time. Even Cheng Wei had question marks above his head. \u201cWhat is this? The Red Fox members haven\u2019t lost much blood and using a group skill will do. Using Desperate Prayer is just a waste!\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t until the next scene that Cheng Wei finally understood.</p><br/><p>It was at this time that Li Cangyu\u2019s water, fire, wind and thunder spirits exploded. The domineering wave of visual effects rushed towards the Red Fox players and covered them. The result was that they were completely protected by Liu Xiang\u2019s halo.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu: A stunned face.jpg.</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei exclaimed, \u201cCat God\u2019s big move was actually blocked! This is the first time in history!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian also gloated. \u201cEvery time Cat God would use the guardian to block other people\u2019s big moves. Today his own big move was blocked. It is fair.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei\u2019s mood was a bit complicated. As a fanboy, he should feel sad that Cat God\u2019s big move was blocked. Strangely\u2026 he was actually quite happy? He looked at the always calm man showing a puzzled expression and finally couldn\u2019t help laughing. \u201cHahaha, I didn\u2019t expect Cat God to be pitted by the Red Fox girls!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian smiled and said, \u201cLiu Xiang is actually more careful than many captains. During the Canglan match, I ignored Cat God\u2019s Cataclysm and allowed him to use it. Liu Xiang\u2019s reaction today was extremely fast. She used a defense skill as soon as she saw him successively calling his pets.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei agreed. \u201cWell, it is normal for girls to be more careful. I remember that Liu Xiang debuted with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian looked over. \u201cYes. Why are you asking this all of a sudden?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei scratched his head and blushed. He suddenly felt that he debuted in the third season and hadn\u2019t improved over the years. Meanwhile, younger players like Tan Shitian and Liu Xiang were making rapid growth. They were already captains and calm and careful when facing strong teams. He couldn\u2019t be compared to them.</p><br/><p>He had to work harder in the future! Otherwise he would be knocked out of the league!</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian saw Cheng Wei blush and them form fists. It was unknown what he was thinking but Tan Shitian felt that Cheng Wei was very cute.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t help reaching out and gently touching Cheng Wei\u2019s hair. Then Tan Shitian turned his gaze back to the screen.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>In the commentators\u2019 room, Yu Bing was showing her appreciation. \u201cCaptain Liu\u2019s big move was very timely and Cataclysm couldn\u2019t show any effect. Li Xiaojiang\u2019s control skill was released but it unfortunately didn\u2019t hit Yang Muzi. It was blocked by Meng Jie.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang had really aimed the fear skill in Yang Muzi\u2019s direction but the moment the skill was released, the berserker Meng Jie suddenly moved sideways and helped block the skill.</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang\u2019s fear skill controlled Meng Jie and Gu Siming immediately rushed to beat her. However, a berserker had thick skin and there was Liu Xiang adding blood in the rear. It was basically impossible to kill her in a short amount of time.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu immediately said, \u201cXiao Gu, stop and come back to protect the outputs.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong\u2019s control effect finally ended. He wanted to cooperate with Li Cangyu to kill one person first. Unfortunately, the Red Fox team moved fast and they suddenly all retreated. It was obvious that they wanted a battle of attrition.</p><br/><p>This soft control consumption play was actually a classic slow-tempo strategy. Red Fox would use control skills and small output skills to consume the other side\u2019s blue until the healer\u2019s blue couldn\u2019t keep up or the other party couldn\u2019t keep up.</p><br/><p>Red Fox was the best at this style because the white magician had many control skills. Their output skills were also terrible.</p><br/><p>Four white magicians sounded frightening but as long as they couldn\u2019t control their opponents then Red Fox was prone to collapse.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why they used the slow-paced style to find opportunities.</p><br/><p>This game was a complete showcase of Red Fox\u2019s soft control tactics. Choosing the Ice Valley map made the Red Fox players like boats floating on the current.</p><br/><p>The deceleration effect of the map relieved their stress.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu couldn\u2019t explode from behind because his Cataclysm was blocked and his pet skills were on cooldown. It had long been said that Cataclysm was a skill that could instantly turn the tables but the consequences of failure were severe.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu\u2019s luck wasn\u2019t good today and his Cataclysm was wasted.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong wanted to save the situation but Cat God\u2019s output couldn\u2019t be counted on. Li Xiaojiang\u2019s actions were slow and Canglan failed to catch up with the rhythm of Red Fox. They eventually lost again.</p><br/><p>The score on the big screen became 2:0 and the Canglan teams couldn\u2019t help blackening themselves. [I don\u2019t feel good today. It will be 0:3!] [It would be too bad to be beaten 3:0 by the female players!] [Everyone, today we can take screenshots of Cat God\u2019s stunned, surprised and helpless expressions. All types of emojis are complete!] [This is a big harvest! Above person, please send Cat God\u2019s expression pack to my mailbox! Thank you!] [Send it to me as well. Thanks!]</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As the number one brainless fan, he thought that people would be scolding Cat God and was prepared to defend him. Instead, he saw the group of people sharing screenshots of Li Cangyu\u2019s various expressions. The brains of these fans were too strange.</p><br/><p>How could the upright Cat God have such teasing fans?</p><br/><p>In the soundproof room, Li Cangyu shrugged helplessly and patted the shoulders of the team members. \u201cToday, everyone doesn\u2019t seem to be in a good state. This is also the first time I\u2019ve played against Red Fox and I was a bit stunned.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan smiled. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. We should concentrate in the third game. Losing 0:3 is too ugly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu nodded. \u201cI think so as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan asked, \u201cWill we change the lineup?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled. \u201cWe won\u2019t change!\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>In the commentators\u2019 room, Kou Hongyi took advantage of the intermission time to say, \u201cThe personal strength of the Red Fox players might not be at the forefront of the league but their tacit understanding is incomparable. The female players united in playing the game and take care of each other. This is why Red Fox\u2019s soft control style can beat many teams.\u201d</p><br/><p>He paused and continued to praise them. \u201cIn the game just now, the players probably felt that they were punching cotton. This is where Red Fox is powerful. Their actions are very uniform and when the team stops, you can only be controlled. Once they move, they are like flexible foxes that the opponents can\u2019t catch up with.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Bing smiled slightly and didn\u2019t say anything. However, she was very pleased.</p><br/><p>In the field of e-sports, the proportion of male players was over 90%. In many games, female players were rare treasures like giant pandas. There were actually many girls playing Miracle but few had a high enough level to play professionally.</p><br/><p>She was very happy that she created the pure female team Red Fox and was also pleased about handing it over to Liu Xiang. This group of women could continue the Red Fox team\u2019s style to today. Even if they weren\u2019t strong, they could unite and play the game. There were many outstanding records where they overturned strong teams.</p><br/><p>Today Cat God lost two consecutive games to Red Fox. It could only be said that he didn\u2019t know enough about the female players. Liu Xiang seemed gentle but she was actually a terrible opponent. In order to win against her, Li Cangyu needed to find a countermeasure as soon as possible.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

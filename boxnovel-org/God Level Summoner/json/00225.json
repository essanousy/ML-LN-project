The two captains gathered their team members together to patiently explain what would happen. The final deployment made the atmosphere particularly tense.</p><br/><p>The fifth game was a random selection so neither of them knew the map or mode.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu quickly said, \u201cIf it is a team battle, we will use the most stable lineup. Xiao Gu, Xiao Han, Ah Shu, Bai Xuan, Old Zhang and me. In the early stages, I will go to where Ling Xuefeng is located and kill him to create an advantage.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it is the arena, Xiao Zhuo and Xiaojiang will prepare to play in the first stage. You have been working together for so long. I believe you won\u2019t drop the chain in the finals.\u201d Li Cangyu patted the shoulders of the two men. \u201cDon\u2019t let everyone down.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang excitedly nodded. \u201cYes!\u201d He hadn\u2019t been able to play today. Since he had an opportunity to play, he definitely wouldn\u2019t lose face for the team!</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu looked at Zhuo Hang. \u201cProtect Xiaojiang and try to move smoothly to the second stage. As for the second stage, I will decide when looking at Wind Colour\u2019s arrangements. Everyone be ready to go out at any time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled as his eyes swept over the faces of his teammates. \u201cPlay stably and don\u2019t be impatient. Even if we lose, we will still be the runner-up. There is nothing to worry about. Just relax and play this game.\u201d He placed his hand in front of everyone, his slender fingers inexplicably giving them peace of mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the last game. Refuel!\u201d Li Cangyu declared.</p><br/><p>The group immediately placed their hands on the captain\u2019s hands and shouted, \u201cRefuel!\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The battle was imminent and Yu Bing\u2019s mood was nervous despite her commenting for many years. \u201cI don\u2019t know what mode and map the final game will be. The strength of the two teams is equal and both have a chance. I can\u2019t predict the final result.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kou Hongyi opened the online voting channel and looked at the date. \u201cThe current support rate is 55% Wind Colour and 45% Canglan. Objectively speaking, today\u2019s Canglan has the strength to compete for the championship.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Bing nodded. \u201cYes. Previously we weren\u2019t optimistic the four newcomers, Zhuo Hang, Xiao Han, Gu Siming and Li Xiaojiang weren\u2019t stable enough. Today, we have seen that the four newcomers are making rapid progress, especially Zhuo Hang and Xiao Han. They are leading competitors among the younger generation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeaking of which, Li Xiaojiang hasn\u2019t played today. I wonder if he will have a chance to play in the finals?\u201d At this moment, the director indicated that the game was starting and Kou Hongyi immediately brought the topic back. \u201cAudience members, the fifth game of the seventh season finals will soon start. Turn your eyes back to the big screen!\u201d</p><br/><p>On the big screen, the random selection for the game mode was in progress. The pointer kept swaying and finally it stopped. The mode selection was completed and it was the arena!</p><br/><p>Next up was the random map selection. The hundreds of maps in the professional league quickly scrolled on the big screen. Which map would the system choose?</p><br/><p>The result was soon revealed\u2014the western suburbs of Yisu City!</p><br/><p>The live audiences suddenly booed. This was the simplest map in the professional league!</p><br/><p>However, in the soundproof room, Li Cangyu and Ling Xuefeng\u2019s eyes flashed with a complicated expression.</p><br/><p>The western suburbs of Yisu City, this was the map they were most familiar with.</p><br/><p>The 17 year old Li Cangyu and 18 year old Ling Xuefeng used to study there every day. At that time, there wasn\u2019t the Miracle League and they were just ignorant teenagers who didn\u2019t care about the world. They just liked the summoner class and had a common language. They met in the square every night and exchanged views on the summoner.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was a rookie and he was always beaten by Ling Xuefeng, but he learnt a lot from every fight. Ling Xuefeng also found that this elf summoner had an unparalleled game talent.</p><br/><p>It was a precious memory of their youth.</p><br/><p>Today, like a fateful arrangement, they led their respective teams and encountered this map in the finals</p><br/><p>The western suburbs of Yisu City had almost no technical content but for Li Cangyu and Ling Xuefeng, this map carried their pure and beautiful time.</p><br/><p>They had played on this map many times when they were young. Now they were top gods in the league, leading their team to win or lose on this map. They would watch each other in the championships and leave no regrets.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>In the commentators\u2019 room, Kou Hongyi couldn\u2019t help spitting out, \u201cIt is such a simple map which doesn\u2019t match the temperament of the Wind Colour and Canglan team\u2026 Of course, this simple map can better reflect the strength of both players.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Bing said, \u201cNext is for the captains of both sides to send people. Both sides won\u2019t know the opponent\u2019s arrangements and there is a bit of luck involved.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two sides could only blindly choose the lineup. They couldn\u2019t choose to target the opponents. Li Cangyu and Ling Xuefeng didn\u2019t think for too long and simply submitted it.</p><br/><p>Wind Colour: Yan Ruiwen and Guo Xuan.</p><br/><p>Canglan: Zhuo Hang and Li Xiaojiang.</p><br/><p>The two messages appeared on screen at the same time. The Wind Colour fans suddenly became very excited. The signature black magician combination was actually played in advance and were facing the slow Li Xiaojiang on the Canglan team. This selection was really good!</p><br/><p>Many spectators thought that the balance of victory tilted towards Wind Colour. After seeing the list, Li Cangyu turned calmly and patted the shoulders of the two teenagers. He whispered, \u201cXiaojiang, pay attention to their control and use the stone pillars as obstacles to obstruct their view of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>On the other side, Ling Xuefeng told Yan Ruiwen. \u201cWatch out for the traps and fight quickly.</p><br/><p>Yan Ruiwen smiled and nodded. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Guo Xuan had some gloating thoughts. \u2018Slow little snail, I will let you know today what a truly violent black magician is.\u2019</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The players on both sides went to the player seats and the deciding game officially began.</p><br/><p>The audience was very unfavourable towards the Zhuo Li combination. They were black magicians but Li Xiaojiang was a bit far from the famous Yan Ruiwen and Guo Xuan. In addition, he was slow to move and took a long time to cast skills. Facing two opponents of the same class, perhaps he might not be able to cast any skills later!</p><br/><p>The facts proved it. The Yan Guo combination worked to suppress Li Xiaojiang, forcibly interrupting many of his skills. They thoroughly understood a black magician\u2019s skills. Once Li Xiaojiang started casting, Yan Ruiwen could make a pre-judgement by looking at his starting action.</p><br/><p>Yan Ruiwen and Guo Xuan\u2019s positioning were also very flexible and they avoided many low level traps. Zhuo Li walked around the pillars and looked extremely passive.</p><br/><p>The two black magicians of Wind Colour chased them and quickly suppressed Li Xiaojiang\u2019s blood to less than 50%.</p><br/><p>After seeing that Li Xiaojiang was forced into a corner of the square, Yan Ruiwen and Guo Xuan started tacitly reading their big moves. As long as these moves hit, Li Xiaojiang would die in a matter of seconds.</p><br/><p>However, at this critical moment, Zhuo Hang suddenly moved from behind a fountain and teleported behind the Yan Guo pair, using a Silence Trap.</p><br/><p>The hunter\u2019s Silence Trap made the person caught in it unable to use any skills. Yan Ruiwen and Guo Xuan\u2019s big moves were forcibly interrupted. The two people had a bad feeling and tried to retreat. The result was that Zhuo Hang had cleverly placed a row of traps behind them.</p><br/><p>This retreat caused them to step into a hunter\u2019s trap and they were set in place.</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang\u2019s trap release speed was extremely fast and the timing was also clever. Yan Guo not only had their big moves interrupted but were also silent and fixed in place. They became frozen targets!</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang naturally wouldn\u2019t let go of this opportunity. As early as when Zhuo Hang placed the trap, he hid in a corner of the fountain and started casting. Zhuo Hang\u2019s traps hit and then Li Xiaojiang\u2019s big move followed\u2014Death Mantra, Hell Flames!</p><br/><p>His casting speed was slow and he could only release two skills but his attacks were extremely strong!</p><br/><p>A large number of points was added into magic attack and the result of his big move was frightening. Death Mantra increased the black magic damage and Hell Flames caused Yan Ruiwen and Guo Xuan\u2019s blood to instantly drop to 65%!</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang followed up with Dark Fear!</p><br/><p>The fixed body and silence state on Yan Ruiwen and Guo Xuan were lifted. The result was it had just been lifted when Li Xiaojiang\u2019s Dark Fear successfully hit!</p><br/><p>The two teenagers\u2019 cooperating with each other made Guo Xuan feel a bit annoyed but it couldn\u2019t be helped. Li Xiaojiang\u2019s group control made him and Yan Ruiwen affected by the fear effect and they couldn\u2019t release skills.</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang took advantage of this to explode a wave of traps. The skill effect on the big screen was gorgeous. Li Xiaojiang also stably cast a continuous damage skill\u2014Shadow Winding.</p><br/><p>Black mist wrapped around Yan Ruiwen and Guo Xuan\u2019s body. Once all the skill damage was settled, Yan Ruiwen and Guo Xuan\u2019s blood had fallen to 45%!</p><br/><p>Many people were gobsmacked. The snail\u2019s burst of attacks was really amazing!</p><br/><p>Yu Bing, who always admired Li Xiaojiang, immediately said, \u201cXiaojiang was pressured and couldn\u2019t cast his skills in the early stages, but he wasn\u2019t discouraged. He might be young but his mental state is stable. He didn\u2019t panic and seriously put out each skill. This is very rare for a newcomer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kou Hongyiadded, \u201cOf course, the key is Zhuo Hang\u2019s clever grasp of the timing. He used the terrain of the fountain to complete the movement of Flying Feather Steps and arrange traps behind the opponents. It is really fascinating.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Bing nodded. \u201cXiaojiang\u2019s reaction is also very fast. The moment that Zhuo Hang acted, he pre-judged where to cast it and he was also skilled in the release and connection of the black magic. It was beautiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two commentators praised Zhuo Hang and Li Xiaojiang because they had performed very well.</p><br/><p>Under the stage, Li Cangyu sighed with relief. It wasn\u2019t wrong for him to spend so much time and energy to train Zhuo Hang and Li Xiaojiang. The cooperation between the two of them dazzled their captain.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>After all, Yan Ruiwen and Guo Xuan were experienced players. Zhuo Li\u2019s outbreak caused them to suffer losses but Yan Ruiwen quickly adjusted his position and cooperated with Guo Xuan.</p><br/><p>This time, the benefits of the double black magicians showed. Death Mantra was constantly stacked so that Li Xiaojiang and Zhuo Hang always had blood loss. A long time passed and the blood gap was pulled back. Zhuo Hang and Li Xiaojiang also weren\u2019t as passive as the beginning. They instead took the initiative to attack.</p><br/><p>They knew they had to do their best to get rid of more blood, consuming the other party as much as possible to pave the way for their next teammates.</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang used his hand speed to release a wave of traps and explode a large amount of blood from the Yan Guo combination. Li Xiaojiang also cast Soul Burning right before he died, hitting Yan Ruiwen and making him lose blood while Guo Xuan lost blue.</p><br/><p>The Zhuo Li combination was eventually killed but they fought until the end and managed to turn Yan Ruiwen and Guo Xuan into a bloody state!</p><br/><p>Yan Ruiwen had 20% blood left while Guo Xuan had 15% blood. Both of them also didn\u2019t have much blue. In particular, Yan Ruiwen was hit by Li Xiaojiang\u2019s Soul Burning at the last moment and his blue was burnt, leaving only 15% left.</p><br/><p>The result was really unexpected, especially for the Wind Colour fans. They thought the Yan Guo combination would easily take care of their opponents. They didn\u2019t expect for Li Xiaojiang\u2019s psychological state to be very stable. He found a chance to fight back even when suppressed. The black magic spells he cast were also very scary.</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang\u2019s level wasn\u2019t as good as Yan Ruiwen. The shy teenager might be at the bottom of the Canglan team but his bones were extremely tough. He put all his effort in every game and did his best for the Canglan team!</p><br/><p>This was enough!</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu saw Li Xiaojiang coming this way and rubbed his head \u201cGood, your mission is done. Hand it over to your teammates.\u201d He got up and submitted the lineup for Canglan\u2019s second stage.</p><br/><p>Kou Hongyi wondered, \u201cWill Canglan send the Shu Bai combination?\u201d</p><br/><p>He had just finished speaking when two names popped up on the big screen\u2014Xiao Han and Xie Shurong.</p><br/><p>Kou Hongyi was punched in the face and had to cough twice. \u201cCat God is worthy of being called the demolition expert. He dismantled the ace combinations of other teams and now he separated the Shu Bai combination of his own team!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Shu Bai combination was broken and Xie Shurong actually partnered with Xiao Han. This was unexpected for everyone.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

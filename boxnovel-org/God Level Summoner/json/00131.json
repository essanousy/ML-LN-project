He was sluggish and his fever turned his consciousness into a mess. There was a burst of pain from his temples and it felt like his head was going to burst. His throat was smoky and his forehead was so hot it was almost burning. His body was covered in sweat, making his clothes stick to him tightly. It was like sleeping in muddy water, really uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>In his dreams, he seemed to have come to a hot desert. He wanted to drink water but couldn\u2019t find his way.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu struggled to open his eyes and find water to drink. To his surprise, he saw the door to his room open and a man entered.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu subconsciously asked, \u201cIs it Old Zhang? Pour me a glass of water\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The man rushed to the bedside and tested the temperature of Li Cangyu\u2019s forehead with the back of his hand. Then he frowned and poured a glass of warm water. He leaned Li Cangyu against his chest and whispered, \u201cDrink some water.\u201d</p><br/><p>This voice didn\u2019t sound like Zhang Jueming.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu opened his eyes with much difficulty. The figure in front of him was a bit fuzzy but the faint scent, handsome side profile and the perfect chin allowed Li Cangyu to instantly recognize the other person. \u201cLing\u2026 Ling Xuefeng?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng replied, \u201cYes. Come and drink water.\u201d</p><br/><p>The cup was raised to his lips. The thirsty Li Cangyu immediately bowed his head and drank some water. The smokiness in his throat was relieved but his voice was still very hoarse. He looked at the man in front of him with disbelief. \u201cHow are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng smiled slightly when he saw Li Cangyu\u2019s dazed look.</p><br/><p>This person was also firm, decisive and vigorous, especially in the arena. His methods were powerful and his tactics unpredictable. He seemed to be afraid of nothing. Ling Xuefeng had never seen his sick appearance and didn\u2019t expect the sick Cat God to become so confused that his eyes couldn\u2019t focus\u2026</p><br/><p>This scene made Ling Xuefeng feel particularly distressed and he wanted to take good care of Li Cangyu.</p><br/><p>It was probably that the stronger a person was, the more shocking it became when they fell down? Ling Xuefeng felt that his heart was going to melt when he saw Li Cangyu showing such a confused and uncomfortable expression.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t help reaching out to touch Li Cangyu\u2019s head and found that sweat had soaked his hair. Ling Xuefeng\u2019s low voice was filled with obvious gentleness. \u201cI am your boyfriend and you are sick. Of course I have come to see you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu didn\u2019t hear exactly what he was saying. He only captured the key word: boyfriend.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu knew that the man in front of him was his most trusted and favourite person and let down his defenses. He couldn\u2019t help reaching out to gently hug Ling Xuefeng and complained, \u201cI feel bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t being spoiled. He was just showing his true feelings in front of his most trusted person.</p><br/><p>He was so uncomfortable that he wanted to take his head off!</p><br/><p>The headache caused by the cold was like an electric drill repeatedly drilling into his brain. Combined with the fever and sweating, his whole body seemed to be burning. This was the first time he had been so sick since he was born.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t dare say these feelings in front of his teammates because he was afraid of affecting their mood when playing the match. He didn\u2019t need to be so scrupulous in front of Ling Xuefeng.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng saw Li Cangyu frowning and gently kissed his forehead. \u201cI brought you cold medicine. Take some medicine and then have a good rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>He pulled the cold medicine out of his pocket as he spoke. He measured the dosage according to the manual and then fed it to Li Cangyu. Then he raised the pillow and had Li Cangyu lean back before going to the bathroom and soaking a towel with cold water to place on Li Cangyu\u2019s forehead.</p><br/><p>The cold temperature on his forehead made Li Cangyu have a moment of clearness. He looked at the man whose front profile gradually became clearer and asked, \u201cWhy did you come from Shanghai?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng explained, \u201cI saw the schedule. Canglan has a match both today and tomorrow. You are strong and definitely won\u2019t tell your teammates. Thus, they won\u2019t take care of you. I was worried and came to see for myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was moved but his mouth still said, \u201cThe round-trip tickets are expensive. It is enough to buy two cars full of cold medicine. It wasn\u2019t necessary for you to go all this way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng smiled and touched his head. \u201cI have already come. Don\u2019t think about this mess and have a good sleep. I will pour you another glass of water.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once he came back with the water, the cold tower had already heated up. Ling Xuefeng tested the temperature of the tower and went back to the bathroom. He washed the towel with cold water again and placed it on Li Cangyu\u2019s forehead.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu felt very comfortable as he was taken care of by Ling Xuefeng. His body was still a bit uncomfortable but his heart was warm.</p><br/><p>Perhaps a sick person was easy to feel moved. The feeling of someone taking care of him was particularly excellent. Otherwise, he would be lying alone in the hotel and it would be very difficult if he wanted a glass of water.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu stared at Ling Xuefeng and didn\u2019t hide the love in his eyes.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng was shocked by these confused and dependent eyes. His heartbeat accelerated and if Li Cangyu wasn\u2019t sick, he would directly overpower Li Cangyu and kiss him all over his body.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng looked down and found that Li Cangyu had sweated too much. His clothes were stuck to his body, which was definitely uncomfortable. Ling Xuefeng helped him take off his clothes, used a towel to gently wipe the sweat off his body and found a new set of pyjamas for him to change to. Then he carefully covered Li Cangyu with the quilt.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was too lazy to move. He waited until Ling Xuefeng changed his clothes for him and covered him with the quilt. His eyes were still staring at Ling Xuefeng.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cWhy are you staring at me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu declared, \u201cI like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This person was really unstoppable when he took the initiative.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng couldn\u2019t hold back and gently kissed him.</p><br/><p>Cat God\u2019s body temperature was particularly high. Once the tongue entered his mouth, the high temperature almost melted a person. Ling Xuefeng gently moved his tongue and sucked for a moment. Li Cangyu\u2019s head was already confused by the fever and he lost all sense of reason from the kiss. He reached out and hugged Ling Xuefeng\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>He seemed to notice that Ling Xuefeng\u2019s temperature was particularly comfortable and tightly hugged his person.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng was kissing when he found that Li Cangyu didn\u2019t respond. He looked down and found that this person had actually closed his eyes and fell asleep. Ling Xuefeng removed his mouth and gently licked the liquid against Li Cangyu\u2019s lips. Then he said softly, \u201cSleep well. I am here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The dazed Li Cangyu heard this sentence and felt at ease, falling into a heavy sleep.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>It was afternoon when he woke up again. Li Cangyu found that his entire body was wrapped around Ling Xuefeng like an octopus. Ling Xuefeng was calmly leaning against the bed, one hand wrapped around Li Cangyu\u2019s waist. It was a very indulgent manner and he showed no trace of impatience.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu didn\u2019t feel embarrassed. It was great holding his wife while sleeping!</p><br/><p>He felt much better after waking up. Ling Xuefeng saw the bright eyes shining at him and couldn\u2019t help smiling gently. He reached out to touch Li Cangyu\u2019s forehead and asked, \u201cIs the fever gone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Li Cangyu sat up and hugged Ling Xuefeng. \u201cIt feels much better. It\u2019s great that you came.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng hugged him back and felt it was worthwhile coming here.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, he came in time when Li Cangyu needed him most.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu hugged the other person for a while before retracting his arms. \u201cYou suddenly ran to Guangzhou. Will there be any problems with the team?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Vice-Captain Yan is there. Lately, it has just been routine training, meaning it doesn\u2019t matter if I\u2019m not there.\u201d Ling Xuefeng paused before asking, \u201cAre you hungry? I\u2019ll order something to eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu did feel hungry. He thought carefully and remembered that he hadn\u2019t eaten anything from last night to the present. He didn\u2019t have an appetite this morning due to the fever. Now the fever was gone and he was aware of his empty stomach. He demanded, \u201cI want to eat porridge.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng kissed his forehead and replied, \u201cThen wait for me. I will order you a meal.\u201d</p><br/><p>He went to the room\u2019s phone, flipped through the menu and had the staff send some food up. He thoughtfully asked for Li Cangyu\u2019s favourite porridge as well as some vegetarian dishes that were easy to digest.</p><br/><p>The hotel staff soon sent up food. Ling Xuefeng took it to the bedside table and said, \u201cEat it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu didn\u2019t eat, his black eyes staring at Ling Xuefeng.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng was puzzled. \u201cWhat is it? Don\u2019t you want to eat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu told him, \u201cI\u2019m a patient.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng reached out and touched his forehead. \u201cIs the fever back? Eat something first. You haven\u2019t eaten all day.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu shook his head. \u201cMy cold is better.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you don\u2019t want to eat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu laughed. \u201cHow can you not understand? I mean that I\u2019m a patient so you should feed me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This person really wanted a mile after giving him an inch!</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng saw the expectant expression and knew that this person was deliberately teasing him, but Ling Xuefeng had to recognize it.</p><br/><p>He took a spoonful of the fish porridge and raised it to his mouth. Li Cangyu immediately opened his mouth and ate it while thinking, \u2018It is amazing to be taken care of by my wife. No wonder why a lot of people want to have a wife to go home to!\u2019</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng watched him take a serious sip of the porridge. Compared with the usual decisive Cat God, Li Cangyu was more like a greedy cat who was hungry. His contented face while being fed made Ling Xuefeng feel very soft. He wanted to keep this big cat for the rest of his life.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng smiled slightly and continued to feed Li Cangyu. Once the bowl of porridge was finished, Li Cangyu ate a few buns. Then he wiped his mouth with satisfaction and said, \u201cI will get up and walk around. I have been lying in bed all night and day. The more I lie down, the worst my headache will become.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Ling Xuefeng helped him up and handed him a glass of water.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu actively moved around the room and felt much better. Then he opened his laptop and opened to the live channel of the second division.</p><br/><p>Half of the Canglan team\u2019s match was over. Zhuo Hang and Li Xiaojiang had tied with the other team in the first two games. The score on the big screen was 2:2. The two teams had each taken a game and were starting the third tiebreaker game.</p><br/><p>When Li Cangyu opened the live channel, Zhuo Hang and Li Xiaojiang were in the midst of a fierce competition with the other side. Zhuo Hang let out an explosive burst of hand speed and placed traps while Li Xiaojiang slowly cast his skills while moving. Every skill cast was extremely accurate.</p><br/><p>The thing that surprised Li Cangyu was that the two youngsters joined forces and actually took the lead in killing the opposite side\u2019s swordsman. Then they joined forces to take care of the white magician and won the third game in one breath.</p><br/><p>The final score of the arena was 4:2 and the Zhuo Li combination won for the first time!</p><br/><p>During the intermission, Zhuo Li both excitedly ran off the stage to accept everyone\u2019s praise.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu wasn\u2019t at the venue but he was very pleased with the youngsters.</p><br/><p>Of course, the opponent in this match was a weaker team in the second division. The victory of Zhuo Li didn\u2019t prove how good they were. Still, it showed that the tacit understanding between them was much higher than the previous match. As long as they slowly progressed and steadily gained experience, one day they would become a truly excellent combination in the arena.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng sat next to Li Cangyu to watch the game. Once the fight was over, he saw the gratified expression on Li Cangyu\u2019s face and couldn\u2019t help gently holding his shoulders. \u201cAre you tired with four newbies playing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Every game he had to consider who to send out, who to train, what map was most appropriate to train on while also ensuring that the score wasn\u2019t bad enough to squeeze them out of the playoffs. Li Cangyu had to consume a lot of brain cells.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu didn\u2019t want to cover up in front of his lover. He spoke bluntly, \u201cIt is very hard but there is no other way. They are still small and need to be honed. Otherwise, they can only wait to be abused in the first division. The future of the Canglan team will be in their hands. I have to raise them as much as possible while I\u2019m still on the team.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng whispered, \u201cI understand that is hard. But are you happy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The two of them stared at each other and smiled.</p><br/><p>They were both captains and knew the pressure on each other\u2019s shoulders. There was no need to say anything else. Just one look was enough.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu saw the man who run all this way to take care of him and couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cIt is troublesome for you to run from Shanghai to Guangzhou. Still, I\u2019m really glad you came.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nothing would happen to Li Cangyu if Ling Xuefeng didn\u2019t come. It was just a cold and he would get over it. It was just that no one would bring him medicine, pour him water, take care of the sweat from his fever, feed him and let him enjoy the treatment of a VIP patient.</p><br/><p>This treatment was outstanding.</p><br/><p>Having someone bring the water to his lips was much better than having to get up and pour water for himself.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu thought this and gently kissed Ling Xuefeng\u2019s lips. \u201cIf you are sick in the future, I will take good care of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a simple promise but it showed he would never leave.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng smiled and touched his head. Then he reached out and held Li Cangyu in his arms.</p><br/><p>A tough person also needed someone to accompany him in times of need.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng was thankful that the moment when Li Cangyu needed care, it was him who was by Li Cangyu\u2019s side.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

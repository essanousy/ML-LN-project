Putting aside the Mechanical City and Mount Huangshan Plank Road, the ones left were Bamboo Sea, Suzhou Gardens and Eight-Trigram Array.</p><br/><p>The Bamboo Sea map looked very simple, especially in the thumbnails. It was a lush sea of bamboo plants.</p><br/><p>In fact, the difficulty was no less than the Mechanical City.</p><br/><p>The Mechanical City was a three-dimensional map with an upper and lower structure. Bamboo Sea was a flat map but it was filled with traps.</p><br/><p>If the map was chosen for death racing then players who didn\u2019t understand the map could easily walk into traps. If selected for the economic war, the number of traps would be reduced but there would be the map NPCs, the pandas.</p><br/><p>Australia had koalas while Spain had bulls. The maps submitted by various countries fully reflected the characteristics of each other. China\u2019s national treasure was naturally indispensable!</p><br/><p>Before the start of the game, the 3d god\u2019s perspective was shown as usual. The Italian team members saw the round, chubby pandas and their expressions became complicated.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe wild area mobs are special. Black and white, what is this?\u201d Someone who had never seen such an animal asked curiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are pandas. They are China\u2019s national treasure and have dark circles and a chubby black and white body!\u201d</p><br/><p>A female player couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cSo cute!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo they have bamboo in their hands?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we attack the pandas, will they use bamboo as a weapon to attack us?\u201d</p><br/><p>The group of people had holes in their brains as they started talking.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, the captain Alberto brought back the topic. \u201cThe first person to be attacked will immediately explain the situation on the voice channel. If my prediction is correct, they should be a melee type mob that bites people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, Captain!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems that this map isn\u2019t too difficult!\u201d Someone commented.</p><br/><p>Alberto immediately denied it. \u201cImpossible. There isn\u2019t any Chinese map that isn\u2019t difficult.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the truth.</p><br/><p>Bamboo Sea didn\u2019t seem difficult but this was abnormal when considering the Mechanical City and Mount Huangshan Plank Road maps selected in the previous matches. Could the Chinese team make a panda and bamboo forest map to sell cuteness?</p><br/><p>There was definitely something hidden!</p><br/><p>The Italian players stared at the screen with wide eyes. Sure enough, the lens moved deep into the bamboo forest and a leaf suddenly fell to the ground. There was a loud noise and a big pit appeared. It was like a pit dug by a hunter when capturing animals in the mountains. The bottom couldn\u2019t be seen at all!</p><br/><p>The Italian players got chills.</p><br/><p>\u201cA trap map!\u201d Someone exclaimed. \u201cThe Chinese team\u2019s maps truly are difficult!\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>At the same time, the domestic comments were filled with large flowers and hugging expressions.</p><br/><p>[Cute panda, I want to hold one!] [Can this map be released in the online game? I want to see the pandas!] [So cute, I can\u2019t bear to fight it!] [How can you fight pandas! Putting pandas in the economic war isn\u2019t scientific at all!]</p><br/><p>A group of people were arguing over this problem until the trap appeared and the style of the comments changed. [It is really a trap, hahaha!] [The foreigners say that the Chinese team\u2019s maps are too hard!] [Trap map, I like it!]</p><br/><p>The maps submitted by each country were unknown. In order to avoid the other side from suffering too much, the entire map would be shown before the game.</p><br/><p>The Italian players quickly learnt the characteristics of the Bamboo Sea map. The pandas were the wild area mobs while there were large and small traps in the bamboo forest. According to the map, players would automatically be transmitted to the return point after falling into the trap.</p><br/><p>Italy\u2019s captain Alberto summed up the map features and convened the players participating to prepare them.</p><br/><p>The map finished showing and the names of the players on both sides appeared on the big screen.</p><br/><p>The Italian team sent out their signature psychic combination with Captain Alberto personally serving as the commander of the game. The remaining four players included two black magicians and two archers.</p><br/><p>The Chinese team\u2019s lineup consisted of Chu Yan and Zhu Qingyue. The black magicians Yan Ruiwen and Guo Xuan and the white magicians Cheng Wei and Yang Muzi also participated.</p><br/><p>Yu Bing saw this and immediately explained, \u201cThe lineup of both sides is consistent with using psychics as the core. In order words, two psychics cooperate to complete their teleportation. They will flash around the field to control and kill the opponents. Because the movement of the whole group is too fast and they disappear and appear instantly, it is called the illusion flow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kou Hongyi wondered, \u201cThen this game is directed by Chu Yan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. In fact, Chu Yan\u2019s command level isn\u2019t weak. Pure Cleansing\u2019s performance in the domestic league isn\u2019t very good but it is because their players can\u2019t keep up with the psychic\u2019s play. Their cooperation isn\u2019t strong and it is easy for them to be targeted, especially in away games.\u201d Yu Bing paused and added, \u201cHowever, today is different. The teammates he brought are the strongest black magicians and white magicians in the domestic league. The team\u2019s strength is raised by a notch.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cToday\u2019s illusion flow will be sure to make us feel refreshed.\u201d Kou Hongyi was excited. \u201cThis map is also quite distinctive. The national treasure has finally appeared!\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The players on both sides were ready in front of the computer and the map loaded.</p><br/><p>In the previous panoramic view of the map, the pandas were shrunk and didn\u2019t feel very real. Now they were immersed in the bamboo forest from a first-person perspective and found the round pandas in the bamboo forest. They were too cute! The eyes of the Chinese audience immediately focused on the pandas.</p><br/><p>The Chinese team split so that Chu Yan and Cheng Wei took one road, Yang Muzi and Zhu Qingyue took the other road while the two black magicians were in the middle. The splitting pattern of the Italian side was similar. The two psychics would split up to develop their economy separately. It was obvious that both sides wanted to play safely in the beginning.</p><br/><p>The captain of the Italian team, Alberto, headed down one road with an archer and happened to meet the Chu Yan and Cheng Wei pair</p><br/><p>At this time, a panda just refreshed. Alberto had his teammate try to attack it. The archer aimed Shock Shot at the giant panda only to see the chubby panda suddenly roll over and cleverly avoided the skill!</p><br/><p>The two Italians, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Too much! The mobs actually had a hiding skill. Chinese team, do you have to dig so many pits?</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei saw the national treasure rolling slowly on the ground and laughed. \u201cSo cute, I can\u2019t bear to fight it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Yan also smiled. \u201cWe can\u2019t fight the pandas directly. We have to use bamboo to catch them. It is estimated that the Italian people haven\u2019t caught on yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed they would have to give a demonstration to the opposite side. Chu Yan took the initiative to pick up a piece of bamboo on the ground and placed it in front of the fat panda. The panda rolling on the ground immediately rushed over and grabbed it, eating the bamboo happily.</p><br/><p>A +100 gold coin tip appeared above Chu Yan\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>The Italian players felt chaotic!</p><br/><p>The wild mobs couldn\u2019t be fought. They had to be fed directly to get gold coins? The pandas of the Chinese team actually ate goods?</p><br/><p>The e-sports reporters and spectators of other countries were speechless and expressed their doubts on the Internet. [Is it possible to set up a map like this?] [The league didn\u2019t dismiss the map of the Chinese team?]</p><br/><p>However, some people praised it. [The Chinese map designers are very creative. It is too boring to kill the mobs in the economic war. Thus, they designed a map full of props to trap the mobs. It is very novel!]</p><br/><p>Alberto watched Chu Yan feed a panda and successfully get gold coins. His face was dark as he spoke in the voice channel, \u201cGrab bamboo to feed the pandas. Hurry up and grab the gold coins!\u201d</p><br/><p>Thus, there was a weird image in the World Competition.</p><br/><p>Pandas refreshed one after another in the bamboo forest. If they were attacked, they would cleverly roll a few laps. It was only when they were fed with bamboo that they would give the players gold coins. The pandas that became full would lie flat on the ground. If they weren\u2019t full, they would roll around for food.</p><br/><p>The Italian players all had dark expressions.</p><br/><p>They always felt that the maps of the World Competition would be broken by these Chinese designers!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

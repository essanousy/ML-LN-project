Soon, the cooldown of his skills was over and Li Cangyu suddenly stopped. He summoned the water spirit and used its control skill!</p><br/><p>However, Ling Xuefeng seemed to have long guessed this and cleverly slipped to the side to avoid it.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu suddenly turned back to attack and the result was that Ling Xuefeng could still avoid it\u2026</p><br/><p>Did they share one brain?</p><br/><p>The more the audience looked, the stranger they felt this game was. It felt like a confrontation between two people with tacit understanding. The Ling Cat combination didn\u2019t even lose to the brothers of the Ghost Spirits team!</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu\u2019s water spirit control skill was wasted but he wasn\u2019t in a hurry. He wandered around the back of a stone pillar and summoned the fire spirit and thunder spirit. His movement speed was affected by Demon Possession but his attack speed wasn\u2019t. The speed of his pets summoning was still dazzling.</p><br/><p>By the time Ling Xuefeng found him being the stone pillar, he faced the fire spirit\u2019s Fireball and the thunder spirit\u2019s Thunder\u2019s Wrath!</p><br/><p>This time, Ling Xuefeng only escaped Fireball. The range of Thunder\u2019s Wrath meant he was hit hard and his blood volume fell from 50% to 25%.</p><br/><p>This blood volume was very dangerous. The explosion of many great gods in the league could take his life with one wave. The Wind Colour fans were a bit anxious\u2026</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Ling Xuefeng was calm despite his residual blood state. After being hit by Li Cangyu\u2019s group attack skill, he immediately retaliated by summoned his skeleton infantry and using Skeleton Explosion!</p><br/><p>The two demon skeletons surrounded Li Cangyu on the left and right and exploded, also forcing Li Cangyu\u2019s blood volume to 25%!</p><br/><p>The two people\u2019s blood volume levelled out again.</p><br/><p>At this time, Demon Possession came to an end. Li Cangyu resumed his previous movement speed and used Flying Feather Steps to disappear from Ling Xuefeng\u2019s field of view.</p><br/><p>The audience couldn\u2019t help feeling nervous. The two gods were bloodied and anyone could seize the opportunity to kill the other person.</p><br/><p>The even more worrying thing was that the two small apprentices had fought alone and also beat each other into residual blood.</p><br/><p>Xiao Han actually played well in the game. At least, he didn\u2019t make the mistake of being accidentally injured by the sacrifice\u2019s rebound shield.</p><br/><p>He cleverly used his stealth skill to delay Qin Mo and went around him, using a beautiful set of assassin combos. However, Qin Mo\u2019s game experience was richer. Immediately after being hit, he summoned the spider to set Xiao Han in place.</p><br/><p>Qin Mo was very familiar with quickly summoning pets. The blood snake\u2019s bite added several layers of blood loss effects on Xiao Han and the blood kin race had the special feature of sucking up blood while attacking. Qin Mo and Xiao Han\u2019s blood volume were originally even but this set of attacks restored Qin Mo\u2019s health.</p><br/><p>Xiao Han was also a blood kin but his skill in sucking blood while attacking wasn\u2019t as sophisticated as Qin Mo. After a long time, the amount of blood that Qin Mo absorbed from attacking surpassed Xiao Han.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu and Ling Xuefeng both had 25% blood left, Xiao Han had only 10% and Qin Mo had 15%.</p><br/><p>Xiao Han\u2019s blood strip was flashing red and he immediately hid in stealth. In this state, he was likely to be directly killed if Qin Mo used the vampire bat\u2019s big move!</p><br/><p>However, Xiao Han underestimated Qin Mo\u2019s sharp insight. The moment he used combat stealth, Qin Mo already opened the vampire bats\u2019 big move. The black bats flew and decisively took away Xiao Han\u2019s blood!</p><br/><p>[Shepherd has killed Frost Descends!]</p><br/><p>The Wind Colour fans cheered excitedly the moment this popped out.</p><br/><p>Xiao Han had died, Qin Mo had 15% blood and Ling Xuefeng had 25% blood left. If the two people stably played Cat God then they would win. Many people wanted to celebrate in advance.</p><br/><p>Still, Li Cangyu wouldn\u2019t admit defeat so easily. The moment Xiao Han died, he already rushed to the battlefield on the other side of the map. He saw the bloody Qin Mo from behind a pillar and summoned his wind spirit to blow Ling Xuefeng away and prevent him from interfering. Then he used the fire spirit\u2019s attack skill to empty Qin Mo\u2019s blood!</p><br/><p>[Old Cat has killed Shepherd!]</p><br/><p>This instantaneous explosive force made Qin Mo feel admiration. When he saw Cat God coming, he wanted to summon the death knight to protect himself. The result was that while reading the skill, he was interrupted by Cat God\u2019s fireball and it was cancelled.</p><br/><p>In other words, Cat God\u2019s reaction speed was at least 0.5 seconds faster than him. This was the gap in awareness between him and a great god.</p><br/><p>Qin Mo was convinced and after dying, he continued to stare seriously at the computer screen to watch his master and Cat God fight.</p><br/><p>The fans of Wind Colour were once again nervous. They thought 2v1 had ensured victory. Who would\u2019ve expected Cat God to use the simplest fireball combo to kill Qin Mo?</p><br/><p>In the commentators\u2019 room, the battle situation was too fierce and the two commentators didn\u2019t dare say too much to interrupt the audience watching the game. After killing Qin Mo, Li Cangyu once again used Flying Feather Steps to escape from Ling Xuefeng. Yu Bing found a gap and immediately said, \u201cIt seems that Cat God\u2019s idea today is very clear. He wants to rely on the advantage of his agility to deal with Ling Xuefeng, slowly finding opportunities to attack.\u201d</p><br/><p>The audience could also see this point. From the opening, Li Cangyu had been detouring the grotto and looking for a chance to shoot. He didn\u2019t fight Ling Xuefeng head on because while he and Ling Xuefeng were fighting, Xiao Han wouldn\u2019t be able to win against Qin Mo. Then Li Cangyu would definitely lose.</p><br/><p>Thus, while facing Ling Xuefeng, he had to carefully observe Qin Mo\u2019s situation. That\u2019s how he took the opportunity to successfully kill Qin Mo. Now that he was left with Ling Xuefeng, he started to rely on the advantage of agility to play a guerrilla style.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu\u2019s skills had less attack power than the other side and he must be careful. If Ling Xuefeng caught an opportunity then Li Cangyu would be the one to die.</p><br/><p>The audience held their breaths as they watched the big screen. They saw Li Cangyu, wearing the white elf uniform, move quickly in the grotto. Ling Xuefeng pursued behind him. After bypassing a complex group of stone pillars, they met in an open space!</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu started to use the thunder spirit\u2019s big move!</p><br/><p>The reason he took a detour was to wait for the cooldown of this move to finish. He didn\u2019t have much blue yet and it was just enough to use this skill. As long as it hit, he would be able to take away the residual blood Ling Xuefeng.</p><br/><p>However, Li Cangyu was halfway through the casting when he was forcibly interrupted by Ling Xuefeng!</p><br/><p>Qin Mo\u2019s reaction speed was slower than Li Cangyu but Ling Xuefeng\u2019s reaction speed didn\u2019t lose to Li Cangyu. The moment they met each other, Ling Xuefeng summoned the demon banshee and used the skill with the shortest casting time, Charm!</p><br/><p>The banshee\u2019s Charm was released quickly, much faster than Li Cangyu\u2019s Thunder\u2019s Wrath. It interrupted Li Cangyu\u2019s skill and also pulled him to Ling Xuefeng\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>The strong pull of Charm not only brought Li Cangyu over but also interrupted his skill casting. This showed that Ling Xuefeng\u2019s grasp of the timing of skills release was also quite accurate.</p><br/><p>After pulling the other party over, Ling Xuefeng also used a big move\u2014Demon God\u2019s Descent.</p><br/><p>He obviously wanted to kill Li Cangyu but was interrupted by Li Cangyu\u2019s water spirit!</p><br/><p>You interrupted me once so I interrupted you. This is quite fair.</p><br/><p>The audience were speechless. The two of them played at 25% blood for a long time and the interruption of skills was like showing love. Couldn\u2019t they finish it quickly? The audience\u2019s hearts couldn\u2019t bear it.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng seemed aware of the audience\u2019s complaints and directly summoned his demon crows!</p><br/><p>The overwhelming black crows surrounded Li Cangyu and instantly blocked his vision. This was the skill that Li Cangyu hated the most.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu had his vision blocked and naturally couldn\u2019t use any skills. Ling Xuefeng took advantage of this short control time to quickly summon the skeleton infantry and had them surround Li Cangyu\u2026</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>[Undead Demon has killed Old Cat!]</p><br/><p>The Wind Colour fans were finally relieved the moment this news popped up on the big screen.</p><br/><p>The Canglan fans were a bit depressed but they thought about how they won the two previous games and the score was 2:1. Then their moods improved.</p><br/><p>The dead Li Cangyu didn\u2019t show a disappointed or frustrated expression. Instead, he showed a handsome smile and quickly typed on the public chat: [Your consciousness is good. Have you been holding back the black crows all this time?]</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng looked serious. [I can\u2019t let you play 3:0.]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu\u2019s smile became happier. [I was prepared to lose 3:0 to you. The result of 2:1 is really cheap. Aren\u2019t you afraid of the reporters saying that you are throwing the match?]</p><br/><p>The reporters in front of the computer who were prepared to write about Captain Ling throwing the match couldn\u2019t help feeling a bit dull\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng replied calmly: [I never throw a match. The fact that you can take two points is due to your ability.]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu felt very proud. [Captain Ling, thank you for the compliment!]</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng asked: [You played three games in a row, are you tired?]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu replied: [Fortunately, there is more time to rest in the middle of the games. I would\u2019ve died from three team battles.]</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng: [Then go back and sleep early.]</p><br/><p>The players, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The audience, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The referee stared blankly at them chatting before he couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. He coughed twice and reminded them on the voice channel, \u201cThe captains of both sides, please go back to chat. First confirm the score and sign the form. Thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The referee\u2019s assistant took the game form to both people for their signatures. Li Cangyu and Ling Xuefeng walked down from the players\u2019 seats and signed their names on the results confirmation form.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>At the end of the match, the big screen scored the score of Canglan 2: Wind Colour 1.</p><br/><p>However, the Wind Colour fans were still immersed in their shock.</p><br/><p>This was the first time in seven years that Ling Xuefeng competed with an opponent in the beginning of the match with his big move and then chatted with the opponent on the public chat once it ended.</p><br/><p>What was wrong with today\u2019s Captain Ling?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

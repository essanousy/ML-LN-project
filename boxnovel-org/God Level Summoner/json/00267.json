Matthew and Daniel were sent off and the Australian guard combination were forced to play in advance. Their IDs appeared on the big screen. They were the blood kin assassin Riley and the black magician Isaac!</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu sat in the rest area and couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cTheir signature combination has finally come out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng nodded and said, \u201cThe strength of this combination isn\u2019t bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>After carefully studying the Australian team\u2019s lineup, the two of them found that the Australian competitors were more polarizing. The famous players were particularly powerful and were ranked in the world, while the others were relatively mediocre.</p><br/><p>For the next two players, the blood kin assassin Riley was the vice-captain of the Australian national team and on the world\u2019s assassin rankings. The black magician Isaac was his fixed partner from the same team. These two people rarely lost against any players in the Australian domestic league. One was responsible for the remote control while the other looked for opportunities to attack.</p><br/><p>They put this ace combination in the guard stage to win five points.</p><br/><p>It was a pity that they would encounter the ace combination of the Chinese team, the Lou Zhang brothers.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu looked at the two people who were ready. Lou Wushuang\u2019s face was still cold but Zhang Shaohui said with excitement, \u201cBrother, let\u2019s kill the magician first when we play!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang hummed in agreement.</p><br/><p>He saw Li Cangyu watching him and gave the captain a \u2018reliable\u2019 look.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The Australian team\u2019s Riley and Isaac were fixed partners. Once they came on stage, they quickly arrived at the centre of the stage. The black magician Isaac moved through the curtains and took control of Xiao Han from behind.</p><br/><p>Xiao Han immediately spoke in the team channel. \u201cRun!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mo decisively turned and hid behind a curtain. He moved flexible and his traces were lost in the blink of an eye.</p><br/><p>The reason why he didn\u2019t go back to rescue was because he knew it was absolutely unnecessary to save Xiao Han at this time. The bloody Xiao Han met the other two\u2019s combined attacks and certainly couldn\u2019t last for five seconds. It was better for Qin Mo to hide and wait for an opportunity. He had to strive and create some advantages for his next teammates.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, the prompt that Xiao Han was killed appeared in the middle of the big screen. By this time, Qin Mo had already reached the depths of the curtain maze. The two Australian players started to look for him in the maze. They had just walked around a corner when a wave of bats flew towards the two people. It was the blood kin summoner\u2019s big move, Blood Bat Festival!</p><br/><p>The cooldown of Qin Mo\u2019s big move had just ended. He opened it at this time and decreased the other side\u2019s blood by 30%, as well as sucking up a lot of blood.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t have much blue left. He wouldn\u2019t last long but it was cost-effective if he could consume his opponent\u2019s skills.</p><br/><p>Qin Mo thought this and summoned the blood knight to delay the battle.</p><br/><p>The other side\u2019s assassin didn\u2019t want to drag things out. He killed the blood knight and worked together to kill Qin Mo.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Once Xiao Han and Qin Mo left the players\u2019 seats, the live broadcast room was filled with flowers and applause. Yu Bing couldn\u2019t help praising them, \u201cThe two princes grew very quickly. It is worthy of their famous teachers!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kou Hongyi also sighed. \u201cI used to think that they are very talented newcomers in the domestic league but today\u2019s performance made me discover that they have become excellent professional players. Whether it is their calm judgment at a crucial moment or their tacit cooperation, it is hard to believe that they are still under 18 years old!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Bing added, \u201cThe two of them are young rookies and their future is immeasurable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kou Hongyi said, \u201cThen let\u2019s see who the Chinese team will send to the guard stage? Our country has so many partners. Which pairing will Cat God send?\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, the pair that the Chinese team sent as the guard appeared\u2014Lou Wushuang and Zhang Shaohui.</p><br/><p>Kou Hongyi exclaimed, \u201cIt is the Lou Zhang brothers!\u201d</p><br/><p>Once the IDs of Killer Lou and Killer Zhang appeared on the screen, the fans of the Ghost Spirits team screamed uncontrollably. The Lou Zhang combination! The most tacit killers, who secretly killed numerous gods in the Chinese league, were now holding hands to appear on the arena of the World Competition.!</p><br/><p>[Captain Lou, marry me!] [Captain Lou is so handsome. His blank expression is still handsome!] [Pushing the Lou Zhang combination for a lifetime!] [Lou Zhang brothers, refuel!]</p><br/><p>The various messages filled the screen, showing how powerful the Lou Zhang brothers were domestically.</p><br/><p>Australia\u2019s Riley felt a big depressed. In fact, he had confidence fighting against Lou Wushuang. After all, their ranking in the world\u2019s assassin circle wasn\u2019t much different.</p><br/><p>The problem was that the Chinese team\u2019s young combination was too powerful. They moved back the weak advantage created by Australia in the first stage and then the big bat move decreased Riley and Isaac\u2019 blood by 30%!</p><br/><p>Riley later relied on his attacks to suck blood and restore it to 80%, but his teammate\u2019s situation wasn\u2019t so good. If they had to fight against the Lou Zhang brothers in these circumstances, the chance of victory wasn\u2019t high.</p><br/><p>They could only rely on the map to gamble.</p><br/><p>Riley\u2019s eyes narrowed and he placed a blue mark on the small map. Isaac agreed and immediately moved to wait near the marker.</p><br/><p>The viewers had a god\u2019s perspective and found that the mark he played was the only way for the Chinese team to go to the big stage after refreshing. However, due to the stage curtains and the dead angle, the Chinese team wouldn\u2019t be able to see the Australian players when they came over.</p><br/><p>In other words, this was a blind spot known only to the Australian team members. Relying on the blind spot to unleash an ambush, this was the advantage of the self-submitted map.</p><br/><p>After seeing that Lou Wushuang and Zhang Shaohui were getting closer to Isaac\u2019s hiding place, the audience couldn\u2019t help sweating for the Lou Zhang brothers.</p><br/><p>\u2014Dark Fear!</p><br/><p>The black magician\u2019s control skill suddenly opened and Zhang Shaohui was fixed in place since he was in front!</p><br/><p>To Isaac\u2019s surprise, Lou Wushuang\u2019s response was almost instantaneous. The moment the black magic skill was released, he decisively accelerated and hid from the control!</p><br/><p>This was a little trick to how the Lou Zhang brothers walked. They didn\u2019t go side by side. Zhang Shaohui walked in front of his brother a few metres every time, keeping his brother behind him. If they encountered a trap or ambush, Lou Wushuang could instantly get away.</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang\u2019s reaction rate didn\u2019t disappoint the domestic fans. He jumped a few metres forward to hide from the opponent\u2019s control and rushed behind the black magician like a phantom!</p><br/><p>Isaac was about to cast a spell but was countered by Lou Wushuang\u2019s Pain Blade and set in place!</p><br/><p>\u2014Back Stab, Death Strangulation!</p><br/><p>Captain Lou was hot and his moves fast and violent!</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui saw his brother attacking the black magician. He was used to it but he still couldn\u2019t help sighing. His brother looked as cold as an iceberg but he was extremely fierce when playing the game. It was estimated that his opponent would have a cold back!</p><br/><p>This type of brother was so cool!</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui never said anything but he worshipped Lou Wushuang and wanted to protect him. Since childhood, Lou Wushuang\u2019s performance had always been better than him and his brother\u2019s IQ was particularly high. Lou Wushuang even played Miracle for a shorter time than Zhang Shaohui but he was better.</p><br/><p>Someone else might be jealous of Lou Wushuang but Zhang Shaohui was lacking in this. He wasn\u2019t jealous of his brother and instead felt admiration, appreciation and worship.</p><br/><p>Now he watched Lou Wushuang making the black magician unable to fight back and Zhang Shaohui thought proudly\u2014this is his brother! His brother was so cool!</p><br/><p>At this time, Isaac wanted to cough up blood. Most of the black magician skills required a casting time. His Dark Fear didn\u2019t control the opposite assassin and he failed to release his skills.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, his teammate Riley arrived in time!</p><br/><p>Riley was in the vicinity and he slammed his dagger down against Lou Wushuang\u2019s neck. However, it was like Lou Wushuang had eyes behind him. He suddenly moved sideways, just managing to avoid this control skill.</p><br/><p>The control technique, Pain Blade was wasted?</p><br/><p>Riley found it hard to believe. He was the ace of the Australian team and never missed a skill when he was behind an opponent! Did Lou Wushuang really have eyes in the back of his head?</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang didn\u2019t have eyes behind him but Zhang Shaohui had eyes!</p><br/><p>The two long-time brothers had nurtured a tacit understanding. Zhang Shaohui would stare at the area behind his brother while Lou Wushuang would notice if there was anyone nearby to disturb his brother. The reason why the brothers were so powerful was because not only could they see in front of them, they could share what they saw through various signals!</p><br/><p>After successfully hiding from Riley\u2019s control skill, Lou Wushuang didn\u2019t pay attention to him and kept attacking the black magician in front of him.</p><br/><p>Riley went crazy and used all the assassin\u2019s explosive moves\u2014Back Stab, Soul Stab, Death Strangulation, Blood Blade!</p><br/><p>They hit Killer Lou one after another, so that Lou Wushuang\u2019s blood quickly flew away\u2026</p><br/><p>However, Lou Wushuang was hitting the black magician\u2019s body at the same time, relying on the blood-sucking advantage to restore half the lost blood.</p><br/><p>The moment that Isaac\u2019s control was lifted, the audience found that he had 45% blood left while Lou Wushuang had 65% left.</p><br/><p>This was a precise calculation of blood. Captain Lou could calmly do it despite being hit from behind.</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui finally moved at his moment. He quickly came behind Isaac and a surprising scene occurred. The audience saw Lou Wushuang use Combat Stealth and became invisible, while Zhang Shaohui also opened Combat Stealth and hid!</p><br/><p>Why did they do it at the same time?</p><br/><p>What did they want to do by using the Combat Stealth which had a long cooldown time?</p><br/><p>Riley of the Australian team was a bit confused. As soon as he recovered, he immediately shouted in the team channel, \u201cIsaac, get out!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, it wasn\u2019t possible. The Lou Zhang brothers seemed to have become one person. They approached Isaac at a very fast speed, one to the left and one to the right, tacitly raising the dagger in their hands\u2014Death Mark, Back Stab, Soul Kill!</p><br/><p>Once the assassin used Death Mark on a target, if they attacked the target from behind within three seconds then there was a 100% chance of a crit being activated.</p><br/><p>This was used by Lou Wushuang and Zhang Shaohui.</p><br/><p>The moment Zhang Shaohui was released from the control, the two of them didn\u2019t need to say a word. They reached a silent consensus to kill the black magician!</p><br/><p>Thus, they didn\u2019t hesitate to use Combat Stealth at the same time. They stared at Isaac and released their moves at the same time, the sharp blade in their hands piercing Isaac\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>Isaac was killed!</p><br/><p>It seemed like Zhang Shaohui and Lou Wushuang had become one person and there was no need to talk about the operation of the two blood kin assassins. They were almost no difference in their moves and it was like a special copying effect!</p><br/><p>Many spectators were gobsmacked and Riley felt his neck become cold.</p><br/><p>These assassins were so terrible. He felt a bit of envy in the midst of his shock. How good would it be if he had such an assassin partner?</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, in the whole Miracle circle, it was estimated that there wasn\u2019t another pair like the Lou Zhang brothers.</p><br/><p>The younger brother could completely copy his older brother\u2019s operation. The joint force and the frightening crit attack, this move directly took away the black magician and turned it into a 2v1 situation\u2026</p><br/><p>Riley used all the strength in his body and used the map to follow the two opponents. In the end, he couldn\u2019t hold on for even half a minute. The moment the cooldown of Zhang Shaohui and Lou Wushuang\u2019s skills were over, the two of them joined forces again to kill Riley!</p><br/><p>The Chinese team was victorious!</p><br/><p>The Chinese team took the lead in gaining 5 points. Zhang Shaohui dropped his keyboard, excitedly spread his arms and dragged his cold-faced brother into a hug. \u201cBrother, we won! You are really handsome!\u201d</p><br/><p>The scene of the two people cooperating to kill the ace of the other team wasn\u2019t new to Lou Wushuang but it was the first time killing an opponent in the World Competition. It was indeed worthy of commemorating.</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang was tightly hugged and leaned his cheek against his brother\u2019s powerful chest.</p><br/><p>At this moment, he really wanted to tell Zhang Shaohui that their Lou Zhang combination could never be separated.</p><br/><p>Still, he forcibly resisted this impulse and pretended to be an older brother. He extended his arms and hugged his brother, a soft expression on his always cold face. \u201cYes, we won.\u201d</p><br/><p>The audience cheered. The first 5 points won by the Chinese team in the group stage of the World Competition was due to the combined efforts of Zhuo Hang, Jiang Xu, Qin Mo, Xiao Han and the Lou Zhang brothers!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Once they finished, it was already dark outside the window.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu\u2019s waist was uncomfortable and his legs were hanging over the edge of the bathtub. He took a deep breath and drew back his legs. Then he touched his stomach and said, \u201cI\u2019m a bit hungry.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had only eaten on the plan and there was a serious physical energy consumption in the afternoon. Li Cangyu was hungry as he got up and planned to find something to eat.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng came up to him and wrapped a towel around his body. \u201cBe careful not to catch a cold.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled and gave Ling Xuefeng a bath towel. \u201cYou as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two men looked at their lover wrapped in a white towel and were filled with a sweet warmth.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng reached out to touch Li Cangyu\u2019s wet hair. \u201cGo dry your hair and I\u2019ll make dinner.\u201d He thoughtfully handed the hair dryer to Li Cangyu.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to cook?\u201d Li Cangyu stood in front of the mirror and blew his hair. He could see the handsome man\u2019s face in the mirror and the other person was staring at him. LI Cangyu couldn\u2019t help smiling, \u201cIt is too much trouble to go to the supermarket to buy ingredients. We should change clothes and find a restaurant to eat at.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll go to the nearby supermarket tomorrow to buy food.\u201d Ling Xuefeng stepped forward and gazed tenderly at his lover. He took the hair dryer and patiently helped this person blow dry his hair.</p><br/><p>The two men dried their hair, changed clothes and went out.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>It was dark outside and the street lights in front of the villa gave a soft warmth. The two people walked for 10 minutes before finding a restaurant on the side of the road. Based on the facade, it was Western food and there weren\u2019t too many customers in the restaurant. They found a quiet corner to sit down and once the waiter came over, Ling Xuefeng used fluent English to order.</p><br/><p>He ordered a couple\u2019s meal as well as an extra portion of black pepper steak and a lemon-flavoured cold drink.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu laughed. \u201cYou still remember my taste?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Ling Xuefeng stared at him. \u201cI remember everything about you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps the lights were too warm and the music too soft. Li Cangyu suddenly felt that Ling Xuefeng\u2019s gentle eyes were a whirlpool, attracting him to sink in.</p><br/><p>-I remember everything about you.</p><br/><p>It was a simple sentence but it contained many years of hard waiting. In fact, this man looked serious and indifferent but he was more tolerant than anyone else. It was just that this strong tolerance was for his lover.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you looking at me?\u201d Ling Xuefeng felt the other person staring and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is because you are handsome.\u201d Li Cangyu replied directly. \u201cI feel I have very good eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two men smiled at each other before the waiter came over and placed food on the table.</p><br/><p>The couple\u2019s package was very rich and enough for two people to eat, but Ling Xuefeng was worried it wouldn\u2019t be enough and thoughtfully ordered the steak for Li Cangyu. Li Cangyu was starving and cut the steak, giving half to Ling Xuefeng.</p><br/><p>The two people quietly ate dinner. They didn\u2019t talk much but this type of tacit understanding allowed even the waiters at the bar to see the deep feelings between them. It seemed there was a strange separation about them. They were in their own world and outsiders couldn\u2019t get involved.</p><br/><p>After eating, Ling Xuefeng took the initiative to get up and pay. Then he asked Li Cangyu, \u201cDo you want to go back to rest or stroll around the beach?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is still early. Let\u2019s go for a stroll around the beach?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Li Cangyu paused before whispering into Ling Xuefeng\u2019s ears, \u201cHowever, I can\u2019t walk too long. My legs are still sore.\u201d</p><br/><p>He spoke directly without any traces of embarrassment.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng remembered the scene where he raised this person\u2019s legs and repeatedly moved in and out of the body and his eyes became gentler. He asked, \u201cWould you like me to carry you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Li Cangyu wasn\u2019t polite. He saw Ling Xuefeng bending down in front of him and immediately got on this person\u2019s back, asking, \u201cI\u2019m not heavy? My weight doesn\u2019t seem to be lighter than you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d LIng Xuefeng\u2019s heart was soft. He started talking as he walked. \u201cAs a child, I always thought that when I have a lover, I would carry them on my back when walking by the sea.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so? Then your wish has come true.\u201d Li Cangyu touched Ling Xuefeng\u2019s chin and joking, \u201cHowever, when you were a child, you probably thought you would be carrying a big beauty instead of a big man?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d Ling Xuefeng honestly admitted. \u201cThen my thoughts changed after meeting you.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>It was dark and Ling Xuefeng carried Li Cangyu on a beach walk. The man on his back wasn\u2019t light but Ling Xuefeng\u2019s pace was still stable.</p><br/><p>The sea at night was mysterious. The faint moonlight caused a series of tiny silver ripples on the sea and the sound of the waves hitting the beach seemed to have a strange power that calmed down the mood.</p><br/><p>The sea breeze was cool and mixed with the damp smell of the sea. Nevertheless, it wasn\u2019t too cold and made people feel refreshed.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu lay on Ling Xuefeng\u2019s back and breathed in the fresh air of the beach. Once they were a dozen metres away from the shoreline, Li Cangyu patted the other person\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cLet me down.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng put him down and stared at him.</p><br/><p>In the soft moonlight, a faint smile could be seen on this handsome face. His lips were red and swollen and his neck was covered with kiss marks.</p><br/><p>An average person would definitely find a way to cover these traces with high-necked shirts. Some people would even be too shy to go out but Li Cangyu never knew shyness.</p><br/><p>This man was open about everything. Once he was in love, he was straightforward and magnanimous.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng smiled and gently held this person\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu opened his mouth. \u201cSuddenly holding my hand, are you trying to say something?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng linked their fingers together and replied, \u201cIt is time to say something.\u201d He gently hugged Li Cangyu and clearly spoke in Li Cangyu\u2019s ears, word by word. \u201cI, love, you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was stunned. He didn\u2019t expect this always cold man to actually say such words.</p><br/><p>In the past, Li Cangyu only had the game in his mind and never thought about love. Apart from eating and sleeping, the rest of the time was spent watching videos of the game, studying various professional features, arranging tactics and organizing his team\u2019s training. His entire world was completely filled with the word \u2018e-sports.\u2019</p><br/><p>Since returning to Miracle and reuniting with Ling Xuefeng, he suddenly discovered that there could be such a beautiful love in the world.</p><br/><p>In these years, he had weathered hardships and drifted through many ups and downs. At this moment, being in this man\u2019s arms made Li Cangyu feel a type of peace.</p><br/><p>A peace that could last a lifetime.</p><br/><p>The feeling of falling in love with someone wasn\u2019t bad. It wasn\u2019t difficult to admit that he fell in love.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled and hugged Ling Xuefeng, replying seriously, \u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s arms suddenly tightened as if he wanted to melt Li Cangyu into his body.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu took a deep breath and smelt the cold and refreshing scent that belonged to Ling Xuefeng. He also tightened his arms and hugged his person.</p><br/><p>Their left hand and right hands were interlocked and clasped tightly to their chest.</p><br/><p>Their right arm and left arm hugged the other person tightly, seeming to make a promise that they would never forsake the other.</p><br/><p>On the beach by the sea, two people embraced each other and the moonlight shone softly on them, as if time had stopped.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

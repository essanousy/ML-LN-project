On the way back to the Miracle Village, Cheng Wei was the only one who was unhappy. His IQ might be low but he wasn\u2019t a fool. In the hallway, he saw Cat God and Ling Xuefeng hugging each other closely. They were only five centimeters apart and Captain Ling could directly reach Cat God\u2019s lips.</p><br/><p>What was going on?</p><br/><p>Had Cat God slipped and was supported by Captain Ling?</p><br/><p>Based on that posture, wasn\u2019t it Cat God who took the initiative to hold onto the other person?</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei only felt confused as the scene from before flashed through his mind.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian saw that he was in a daze and didn\u2019t take the initiative to provoke him. Once everyone arrived at the restaurant of the Miracle Village, Tan Shitian thoughtfully gave Cheng Wei a large dish of sweets.</p><br/><p>The matcha cake and white chocolate cake were his favourites. In the past, he could eat 10 pieces in one breath. Today, he stared hesitantly at the plate before putting it down with a lack of interest.</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t eat. I want to go back and sleep.\u201d Cheng stated as he got up.</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui was sitting next to him and expressed some doubts. \u201cIs there a problem with Xiao Wei\u2019s stomach as well? How can he eat so little today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei hung his head and replied, \u201cI have no appetite.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui still wanted to ask but he heard Lou Wushuang\u2019s cold voice stating, \u201cEat and don\u2019t ask too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Zhang Shaohui had to give up his intention to keep inquiring. Moreover, Cheng Wei ignored him and directly turned to leave.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei returned to his room and directly lay on the bed to sleep. Tan Shitian looked at the lump on the bed in a funny manner and walked over. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei turned over. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about a problem. Don\u2019t talk to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian teased him, \u201cYour brain capacity isn\u2019t big enough, just like a computer without enough memory to play a game. What\u2019s the problem? Should I help you think about it?\u2019</p><br/><p>These words made Cheng Wei open the quilt and sit up angrily. \u201cTan Shitian, what metaphor are you using? My brain capacity isn\u2019t big enough. Does that mean I am dumber than you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian just smiled and Cheng Wei realized that it was an attempt to stimulate him. He soon became depressed again and wanted to continue thinking. As a result, Tan Shitian pulled him over and asked softly, \u201cAre you wondering about that scene you saw in the hallway today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei frowned. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>His face was wrinkled like a steamed bun and he looked so cute. Tan Shitian endured the urge to reach out and pinch his face. \u201cCat God and Captain Ling were hugging in the hallway. Do you think there is a problem?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei scratched his head. \u201cI just feel\u2026 it is a bit strange?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is it strange?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei thought for a moment before explaining, \u201cI just think\u2026 the movements of the two of them are like\u2026 they were going for a kiss.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This guy caught the key point in a critical moment!</p><br/><p>It was just that his brain capacity wasn\u2019t enough and he couldn\u2019t understand the complex reality. Of course, don\u2019t blame Cheng Wei. What average person would think that Li Cangyu and Ling Xuefeng\u2019s relationship would be like this? Li Cangyu and Ling Xuefeng were handsome and the type that was popular with girls.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian knew the truth and felt a bit complicated.</p><br/><p>He looked at Cheng Wei\u2019s worried appearance and couldn\u2019t bear to let Cheng Wei face such a big impact. After all, Li Cangyu was Cheng Wei\u2019s idol. If the brainless fan knew that Cat God was taken by Captain Ling, he might take a knife to chope at Ling Xuefeng.</p><br/><p>Cough, it was better to let Cheng Wei be in the dark.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian thought this and immediately said with a straight face, \u201cHow can you think that of them? Captain Ling and Cat God are the leaders of the national team. Every day, they are busy with the game tactics. They just had an interview with reporters and were obviously whispering in the hallway when we saw them.\u201d He paused before adding seriously, \u201cCat God is your idol. Do you think he would like a person like Ling Xuefeng?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei heard Tan Shitian\u2019s words and blushed. \u201cI am wrong! Ling Xuefeng, this cold and haughty person, is definitely a person who wants to defeat Cat God!\u201d Cheng Wei was finally happy. \u201cIt seems that I was thinking too much. Cat God definitely isn\u2019t that type of person!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian felt guilty at distorting the truth for Cheng Wei. However, he saw Cheng Wei\u2019s good mood and didn\u2019t regret his decision.</p><br/><p>Today, he noticed that things between Ling and Cat weren\u2019t quite right. It was an opportunity to test Cheng Wei\u2019s attitude on this matter.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian suddenly held Cheng Wei\u2019s shoulder and asked seriously, \u201cXiao Wei, do you hate the thought of two men being together?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei was startled and answered, \u201cIsn\u2019t it strange for two men to be together?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian wondered, \u201cWere you surprised when I kissed you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei thought of the scene where he was kissed. A string in his mind was touched and the sensations he felt at that time appeared clearly. Cheng Wei turned red and immediately pushed Tan Shitian away. \u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense! I\u2019m going to sleep now.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had just buried himself in the quilt when Tan Shitian opened the quilt, raised Cheng Wei\u2019s jaw with his fingers and followed with warm lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Cheng Wei\u2019s eyes widened from shock.</p><br/><p>However, Tan Shitian was pressed against him and he couldn\u2019t resist. The flexible tongue opened his teeth and dove straight in. The familiar taste of Tan Shitian filled his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026 um\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei stretched out his hands and struggled. Tan Shitian pulled the hands behind his head, making the kiss deeper so that Cheng Wei could barely breathe.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026hmm\u2026um\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A strange feeling shot to his mind along the contact areas. His body tingled like there was electricity. It was strange but it made him excited, like the door to a new world had been opened.</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei no longer resisted and passively accepted Tan Shitian\u2019s kiss. His cheeks were so red it was like blood could be squeezed from them.</p><br/><p>At the end of the kiss, Tan Shitian\u2019s face was flushed and his voice was low and hoarse. \u201cDo you hate me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei\u2019s spirit returned and he punched Tan Shitian, only for his fist to be caught.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian continued to ask softly, \u201cDo you hate it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei\u2019s eyes were big and fierce as he tried to kill Tan Shitian with his eyes. However, he only met a gentle gaze and became stunned. Once his first was let go, he turned his head and spoke in a depressed manner, \u201cTan Shitian, stop playing tricks on me. I don\u2019t want to play this game with you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he covered himself with the quilt.</p><br/><p>Inside the enclosed nest, he could hear his loud heart pounding and pounding, almost jumping out from his chest.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t dare answer the question just now.</p><br/><p>It was because he didn\u2019t hate Tan Shitian\u2019s kiss. He enjoyed it and even felt some anticipation.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian might be playing a trick on him but he was addicted to the strange and exciting kisses\u2026</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei felt somewhat disgusted with himself and rubbed hard at his lips in a self-destructive manner before closing his eyes.</p><br/><p>Then he seemed to hear a soft sigh from outside the quilt. \u201cI\u2019m not playing games with you. In fact, I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The voice stopped here. Cheng Wei\u2019s ears pricked as he wanted to keep listening, only to hear Tan Shitian moving away.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

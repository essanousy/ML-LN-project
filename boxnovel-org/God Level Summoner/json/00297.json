He couldn\u2019t help sighing in admiration at Captain Ling\u2019s violence. It was so terrible as his partner. What about his opponent?</p><br/><p>In the past, Zhuo Hang hadn\u2019t dealt directly with Ling Xuefeng. He just felt that the other person\u2019s style was aggressive from the perspective of a watcher. Today, Zhuo Hang stood by his side and felt a huge pressure!</p><br/><p>Captain Ling was not only fast, he was quite decisive. Attacking the enemy with a wave of skills in seconds was the play he was best at. Zhuo Hang was busy setting up traps and always felt that eight hands weren\u2019t enough!</p><br/><p>After returning to the room in the evening, Zhuo Hang couldn\u2019t help telling Li Xiaojiang on WeChat: [Xiaojiang, I am partnering with Captain Ling and I always feel that I don\u2019t have enough fingers. His play is too violent\u2026]</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang was surprised. \u201cHey? You, you are partnering with Captain Ling? Is it for the next match against Italy?\u201d</p><br/><p>The voice coming through the phone seemed to be softer. Zhuo Hang listened to the stuttering and his mood became better. He held the record button and continued, \u201cyes, I didn\u2019t expect Captain Ling to call me to go to the arena with him. This is my first time partnering with him and I feel good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang listened to the voice and immediately changed to typing: [The tactics of the national team, you can\u2019t reveal it in advance!\u201d</p><br/><p>He naturally didn\u2019t stutter when he typed. His sentence was very fluent and seemed to have a hint of criticism. Zhuo Hang saw the serious line of words and couldn\u2019t help smiling. [Do I have to conceal it from you? Will you go out and say it?]</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang: [Of course not!]</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang: [Then why does it matter? I\u2019m just telling you and you are my most trusted friend.]</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang saw this and couldn\u2019t help feeling moved. The tactics of the next match in the National Competition could be called the biggest secret. The players had to keep it a secret. Zhuo Hang took the initiative to tell Li Xiaojiang that he was partnering with Captain Ling in the arena. This showed his absolute trust in Li Xiaojiang. He was very happy about being trusted by Zhuo Hang.</p><br/><p>Even so, Li Xiaojiang still replied sensibly: [Don\u2019t tell me other tactics. This isn\u2019t very good. Cat God will be angry if he knows.]</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang inexplicable felt some loss when he saw this and quickly typed: [I just wanted to share my excitement with you. It is the first time partnering with Captain Ling and it feels very different. I just wanted to tell you this. Don\u2019t think too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>After typing it out, he felt it was too immature and immediately deleted it, changing to another reply: [I know. I will pay attention and not tell anyone the tactical secrets.]</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang: [That\u2019s good.]</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang still felt a bit depressed. He wanted to share a secret with his friend and ended up being scolded by his friend. \u2018You can\u2019t tell the secret. It isn\u2019t right.\u2019</p><br/><p>It felt like being splashed with cold water.</p><br/><p>However, Zhuo Hang saw him seriously considering the national team and couldn\u2019t be angry.</p><br/><p>Xiaojiang was indeed more sensible than him. Tactical secrets shouldn\u2019t be leaked. This was the morality of a professional player. He couldn\u2019t say it even to his best friend. For example, Cat God had a good relationship with Captain Ling but in the domestic league, he didn\u2019t mention any tactical arrangements.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t just responsibility to his teammates but also respect for the other side.</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang thought this and sent another message to Xiaojiang: [You are really smart. I hadn\u2019t thought of this problem. Thank you for reminding me! There will be a few days of rest after this match. I\u2019ll take you to eat something delicious!]</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang instantly replied: [I don\u2019t want to eat. You should train well in the national team and don\u2019t think about running out.]</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>How did he have the tendency to be controlled by Li Xiaojiang?</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang scratched his head in a confused manner but the feeling of being taken seriously by the small snail wasn\u2019t bad.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

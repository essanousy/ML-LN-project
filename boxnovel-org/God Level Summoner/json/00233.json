They announced Li Cangyu as the captain, Ling Xuefeng as the vice-captain and the fact that the public selection for the national team would start in two days.</p><br/><p>Apart from the two summoners filled by Li Cangyu and Ling Xuefeng, all other classes would be fairly selected. The netizens had no opinion on this. After all, other domestic summoners were no match for Ling Cat. They were also the captains of the championship and runner-up team. It was understandable that they would be on the national team.</p><br/><p>However, there were many of Ling Xuefeng and Li Cangyu\u2019s sunspots who weren\u2019t satisfied. [The nice point about the lineup is that it is comprehensive. The bad point is that there is no distinctive characteristic!]</p><br/><p>[There are two of every class. Why does the captain of the national team think this is a good idea?]</p><br/><p>[Who set this up? Li Cangyu SB, Ling Xuefeng SB, the two of them are really a pair of SB!]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu saw this comment and couldn\u2019t help smiling at Ling Xuefeng. \u201cLook, they said we are a pair.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu could selectively ignore the scolding words and extract the words \u2018a pair\u2019 in order to joke around. His heart was really big. Ling Xuefeng gently touched his shoulder. \u201cThe news has been announced so you will definitely be bombarded with reporters at the press conference.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled lightly. \u201cWhat is there to be afraid of. In any case, you will be there and I will have company for the bombardment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng couldn\u2019t help smiling at this.</p><br/><p>Yes, no matter what happened, regardless of success of failure, they would face it together!</p><br/><p>He had this person to walk beside him. Even if the road ahead was hard, they had the confidence to go down it together.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>At the noon press conference, many reporters questioned the lineup of the national team. \u201cThis arrangement, don\u2019t you feel there are too many remotes and too few melees?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng replied, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu said, \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them replied in unison and the reporters were a bit dazed.</p><br/><p>The southerner who wasn\u2019t clear about Li and Ling, smiled. \u201cCough, I actually wanted to ask Cat God. Sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. Xuefeng knows what I mean and answered the same as me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Were they wearing the same pair of pants for the interview today?</p><br/><p>A female reporter stood up and asked, \u201cThere are 22 people on the national team. Isn\u2019t two healers too few? According to the six person arrangement of a team battle, shouldn\u2019t there be at least four healers?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu explained, \u201cThe national team isn\u2019t necessarily a copy of a league match. Some team battles might not necessarily be played. Two healers are enough. If there are more outputs then we can freely change the lineup later.\u201d</p><br/><p>The female reporter could only sit down with a red face.</p><br/><p>\u201cI noticed that in the national team\u2019s lineup, there are only two spots for a front row tank. The berserkers and paladins can play this role.\u201d The reporter who stood up this time knew more about the game. \u201cThe paladins and berserkers will be given to these two places. Isn\u2019t the name of spots for tank players too small?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng replied calmly, \u201cThe team battle requires only one tank type. In the death racing competition mode, sometimes a pure output lineup is needed and we might have to abandon the front row meat shield. Having two tanks isn\u2019t lacking.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu added, \u201cYes, the World League\u2019s new death racing mode is a speed game based on 10 heads. There is definitely a need for more output classes, which is why we chose a large number of output classes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng continued, \u201cI have discussed all possible solutions with Cat. We finally set this comprehensive selection plan to minimize accidental factors.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters were stunned and couldn\u2019t respond when he said \u2018Cat.\u2019</p><br/><p>Everyone looked at Li Cangyu with complicated expressions and found that the latter was very calm. It seemed he was accustomed to this name\u2026</p><br/><p>A straightforward reporter directly asked, \u201cCaptain Ling, is that your special name for Cat God?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I\u2019ve called him that for many years and have become used to it.\u201d Ling Xuefeng\u2019s expression was also very calm.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled and said, \u201cThis is more amiable. You can rest assured that the national team\u2019s captain and vice-captain have a good relationship and there will be no disagreements. Even if there are differences in opinions, we will discuss the solution. In the past, we have been called the strongest opponents. However, this time our goal is the same.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng nodded. \u201cYes, we will do out best with the national team in the World Competition.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu added, \u201cOut netizens shouldn\u2019t worry too much. Once the lineup is decided, we will have a period of intensive training. I believe that the strength of the China Miracle League players won\u2019t disappoint anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng followed up, \u201cIf there are any questions about the national team, please ask.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d The reporters looked stunned.</p><br/><p>They suddenly felt that Vice-Captian Ling was \u2018following his husband!\u2019</p><br/><p>The two great gods speaking in unison, was there anything else to say?</p><br/><p>Finally, a reporter raised a relatively sharp question. \u201cCaptain Ling, you have always been the boss of the Wind Colour team and everything was decided by you. Now you are the vice-captain of the national team. Don\u2019t you feel reluctant?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng replied simply, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018In my team, I have the final say. In the national team, my wife has the final say.\u2019</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled. \u201cThe tactics of the national team is definitely something I will discuss with Xuefeng. The commander will also rotate. The captain and vice-captain positions are just in name and there is no need to be too tangled up in them. You only need to know that we will work together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>In any case, Captain Ling always felt that Cat God\u2019s words were right and Cat God always thought that Captain Ling was right.</p><br/><p>Everyone felt that today\u2019s interview gave off the illusion of two cats fitting together. They wore the same pair of pants for the interview, talked together and gave reasons that couldn\u2019t be refuted. They were worthy of being the captain and vice-captain of the national team.</p><br/><p>The many reporters felt that they were defeated\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

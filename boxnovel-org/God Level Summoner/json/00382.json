He wanted to go back to accompany his parents but as a result, Xie Shurong had to follow. He hugged Bai Xuan and complained, \u201cI have to go. You can\u2019t leave me alone in Changsha. I will think of you every day and miss you so much that I can\u2019t sleep or eat\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He was like a koala as his body hung on Bai Xuan. Bai Xuan glanced at him helplessly. \u201cHow old are you? Can you grow up a bit?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong replied earnestly, \u201cI just turned three this year.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The Miracle League\u2019s Most Shameless Award would definitely be awarded to Xie Shurong, there was no doubt. This person was obviously taller than Bai Xuan but he spoke with a spoiled face. Bai Xuan really wanted to kick him out.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot this time.\u201d Bai Xuan tried to remove the other person\u2019s hands from his waist. \u201cAh Shu, don\u2019t make trouble. My parents might know about my sexuality but I\u2026 I\u2019m not reader to take you home just yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong understood his meaning and a trace of loss flashed in his eyes. His voice was also wronged, \u201cIs it because I don\u2019t meet the requirements of your parents? Or do you mean\u2026 you don\u2019t really like me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan sighed inwardly and didn\u2019t know how to explain.</p><br/><p>In fact, Bai Xuan didn\u2019t feel anything when Ah Shu first pursued him. After all, his ideal lover was a mature, stable and responsible man, not someone younger like Xie Shurong.</p><br/><p>Then Ah Shu\u2019s passionate pursuit touched him and he promised to give the two of them a year to get along. In the blink of an eye, the one-eye contract was about to arrive. The problem of whether to continue dating this person or not was something that Bai Xuan had been thinking seriously about recently.</p><br/><p>During this year, Xie Shurong\u2019s performance wasn\u2019t perfect but he never dropped the chain in key moments.</p><br/><p>In the game, Xie Shurong was a sharp sword that could attack, retreat and defend. He played the game with sharpness, making his teammates feel he was exceptionally reliable. In real life, Xie Shurong was spoiled, would sell men, was greedy and childish. However, he also took care of Bai Xuan in a careful and thoughtful manner, especially when Bai Xuan was sick.</p><br/><p>Such a contradictory person made it difficult for Bai Xuan.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong was far from the mature and stable boyfriend Bai Xuan had been looking forward to but Bai Xuan was reluctant to separate from him. Bai Xuan himself was still unclear about his feelings towards Xie Shurong and could only take one step at a time.</p><br/><p>After a moment of silence, Bai Xuan smiled helplessly and whispered, \u201cI\u2019m going home to visit my parents and can\u2019t take you. I\u2019m afraid that my parents won\u2019t accept it for a while and want to prepare them first. You are still young and there is no need to be too anxious.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong hung his head. \u201cThen will you miss me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan\u2019s heart softened and he reached out to touch this person\u2019s face. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong was happy and hugged Bai Xuan hard. \u201cI will miss you every day.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan smiled and hugged him back. He patted Xie Shurong on the shoulder like a brother and told him, \u201cI\u2019m going to pack before catching a plane tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong looked reluctant as he refused to let go of Bai Xuan.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan helplessly ordered him, \u201cLet go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGive me a kiss and I\u2019ll let go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan was speechless and kissed this person. As a result, Xie Shurong didn\u2019t let go but actively deepened the kiss.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This kiss was gentle to the extreme and the deep love and reluctance to give up were clearly passed through the tongue.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan\u2019s legs weakened from the kiss and he grabbed Xie Shurong\u2019s arm.</p><br/><p>At the end of the long kiss, Xie Shurong finally let go and smiled. \u201cGo, pack your luggage and sleep early. I will miss you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Bai Xuan was afraid to look him in the eye and almost fled.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The next morning, Bai Xuan arrived early at the airport for a security check. He boarded the plane and had just put away his luggage when a familiar voice was heard behind him. \u201cHello beauty, can I change positions with you. This is my friend.\u201d</p><br/><p>The lady next to him smiled and changed her position with the young man.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan looked back and saw the young man wearing jeans and a short-sleeved t-shirt. He was tall, upright, handsome and particularly charming when he smiled. He was a typical sunny person. Then his gaze fell on Bai Xuan\u2019s face and he smiled. \u201cHey, Vice-Captain Bai, we are actually on the same flight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Fart!</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan really wanted to open the window and throw Xie Shurong outside.</p><br/><p>What about last night\u2019s reluctance? It was all fake!</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan took deep breaths to stabilize his mood before frowning. \u201cHow are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong looked sincere. \u201cThe holiday is too long and I was bored staying at the team\u2019s headquarters. Thus, I want to to go Hangzhou to play for a few days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy go to Hangzhou instead of other cities?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong replied, \u201cI want to see Leifeng Tower and only Hangzhou has it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBe honest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong smiled. \u201cIt is because I guessed you were going home and booked a ticket to Hangzhou in advance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan helplessly turned a blind eye to this person, not wanting to care about him anymore. He spoke seriously, \u201cYou are free to play wherever you like but I told you before, I won\u2019t let you meet my parents for the moment\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong hung his head. \u201cI know, I\u2019m only your boyfriend and haven\u2019t passed the internship yet. I\u2019m not qualified to see your parents. I still have some self-knowledge.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan saw this person\u2019s head getting lower and lower and felt a bit distressed. Did he hurt this person? However, the relationship between the two of them wasn\u2019t stable at present. Bai Xuan didn\u2019t want his parents to know about Xie Shurong too early\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can rest assured that I won\u2019t rush to your house to find trouble. I\u2019ll just live near your house, okay? I want to see you every day\u2026\u201d Xie Shurong looked up at Bai Xuan, black eyes filled with pleading. The pitiful gaze instantly hit Bai Xuan\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan had to lower his head and promise, \u201cFine, I\u2019ll book a hotel for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>A bright smile immediately appeared on Xie Shurong\u2019s face and he rushed over to kiss Bai Xuan\u2019s cheek. \u201cI knew that you couldn\u2019t bear to drive me away.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan\u2019s face turned red with embarrassment and he glanced around. Fortunately, the passengers around him were busy sorting their luggage and didn\u2019t notice Xie Shurong\u2019s bold move. Bai Xuan warned Xie Shurong and Xie Shurong immediately sat down, fastening his seat belt and placing his hands on his knees. He seemed to be saying that he wouldn\u2019t do anything.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan couldn\u2019t help smiling at the serious sitting posture. How did he meet such a living treasure?</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>In the evening, the plane arrived at Hangzhou Airport. Bai Xuan took a car and went home while dropping off Xie Shurong on the way.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan had chosen a hotel close to home for Xie Shurong. Once all the arrangements were made, Bai Xuan returned home and smelt something strong when walking through the door. Apparently, his parents had prepared a feast for him.</p><br/><p>The family sat around the table. Bai Xuan was eating the delicious food made by his mother but he was feeling uneasy. Ah Shu had just settled down at the hotel and hadn\u2019t eaten dinner. Was he eating alone right now?</p><br/><p>He was too immersed in his thoughts that he didn\u2019t hear his mother asking something until the table was knocked on. Mother Bai\u2019s voice entered his ears, \u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan came back and smiled. \u201cI haven\u2019t been home for a long time and your food is better than before.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mother Bai smiled. \u201cIt is useless to sweet talk me. I care more about your lifelong events. You aren\u2019t too young. Don\u2019t think about playing games and winning championships all day. You should be looking for a boyfriend.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan touched his nose with embarrassment. \u201cIt is still early.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mother Bai spoke seriously, \u201cIt isn\u2019t too early. I see that Li Cangyu is very good. He is handsome, loyal and upright\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan immediately coughed. \u201cI\u2019m only friends with him. Mother, don\u2019t have crooked thoughts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen who do you like? My mind is open and you can rest assured that as long as you like him, I will support you. You can\u2019t always be single.\u201d</p><br/><p>His parents had been very worried when Bai Xuan told them about his sexuality. Bai Xuan was gentle when he was young and Mother Bai was nervous. She didn\u2019t want him to commit suicide and didn\u2019t dare exert any pressure on him.</p><br/><p>A long time passed and the old couple had long become used to this matter. They didn\u2019t care as long as their son found a reliable person and was happy.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan was grateful to have such enlightened parents but his mother had been concerned about his emotional matters for the past two years. From time to time, she would tell him to find a boyfriend, making him feel helpless.</p><br/><p>After facing his mother\u2019s worried eyes, Bai Xuan had to vaguely say, \u201cCough, in fact, I actually have a boyfriend. When the time comes, I\u2019ll bring him to see you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mother Bai was happy. \u201cAh, really? Then bring him home.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes\u2026\u201d Bai Xuan replied in a perfunctory manner before placing a rib into his mother\u2019s bowl, changing the topic. \u201cMother, you have to eat more. How have you lost weight recently?\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The meal made Bai Xuan tense and his parent\u2019s excessive care was a pressure on him.</p><br/><p>After dinner, Bai Xuan sat in his bedroom and sent a WeChat to Xie Shurong. \u201cHave you eaten dinner?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong quickly replied. \u201cI ate a bowl of instant noodles at the hotel.\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice sounded pitiful and Bai Xuan couldn\u2019t help feeling distressed. He quickly typed. \u201cWhat\u2019s delicious about instant noodles? Why didn\u2019t you go outside to eat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong sent a row of sad expressions, followed by a voice message. \u201cI miss you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan\u2019s ears warmed as he listened to the voice. He hesitated for a moment before sending, \u201cI went home and my mother asked about my feelings. In order to make her feel relieved, I said that I have a boyfriend.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong\u2019s eyes lit up and he sat up on the bed. \u201cThen?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan felt helpless. \u201cShe wants me to bring my boyfriend to meet her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong excitedly rolled around in bed while continuing with the voice message. \u201cNo problem, I have been waiting to meet your mother. I will definitely perform well!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan was amused and there was some gentleness in his voice. \u201cThen I will pick you up tomorrow. Go to sleep early. There are many mosquitoes here so remember to close your screen window.\u201d</p><br/><p>After turning off his phone, Bai Xuan lay in bed and thought his decision was a bit hasty.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, emotional matters were complicated and the result couldn\u2019t be predicted from the beginning. As Xie Shurong said, many people set standards when choosing a lover but the person they ended up with often didn\u2019t necessarily meet those standards.</p><br/><p>For example, a girl wanted to find a boyfriend who was over 1.85 metres. Then her final husband ended up shorter at 1.8 metres. Once fate arrived, it couldn\u2019t be blocked.</p><br/><p>During the time he spent with Ah Shu, Bai Xuan had been very happy overall.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong was a living treasure who could always make him laugh and forget his troubles. This boyfriend might not be mature enough but he was serious and cherished every moment of their time together. Bai Xuan couldn\u2019t deny this relationship just because Xie Shurong was young. Perhaps Ah Shu was the right person for him?</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan thought this and couldn\u2019t help blushing. He was preparing to go to bed when a video request popped up on WeChat. He opened it and saw Xie Shurong with three sets of clothes side by side on the hotel\u2019s big bed. Xie Shurong pointed to the clothes and asked, \u201cWhich one do you think I should wear? The suit looks too old and the t-shirt is too casual. Then what about the shirt? White? Blue?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan laughed. \u201cAre you attending an interview?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong was earnest. \u201cI am going to see your parents and naturally have to dress to make them like me. If your parents don\u2019t like me then it will be hard for you to be caught in the middle. I don\u2019t want to make things difficult for you. I am still in the internship. It might be acting but I have to achieve a full score.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan watched the young man seriously picking clothes and his heart was moved.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong really cared for him, thus he would pay attention to Bai Xuan\u2019s parents. The young man in front of him didn\u2019t meet the conditions of his ideal lover but Xie Shurong loved him with a sincere heart.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan smiled and said, \u201cWear the light blue shirt. You look handsome in it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that right? I think this looks good as well!\u201d Xie Shurong immediately took off his pyjamas and put on the shirt. He took a cool pose, raised his chin and asked, \u201cHow is it? Is your boyfriend so handsome that people can\u2019t look away?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan almost laughed. \u201cCan\u2019t you have any face?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong replied seriously, \u201cIf I succeed in convincing you then I can be a person who changes my skin and bark.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Xie Shurong took care of the Zhou Lu combination, followed by the double archers of Time. He might not have much blood left but he successfully completed his mission on the arena.</p><br/><p>Now it was up to Cat God.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong easily placed his hands on his keyboard and patiently waited for the Time team\u2019s guards to play.</p><br/><p>On the big screen, the IDs of the opponents for the third round were quickly revealed: Ten Days and Only Dedication. Time sent their ace combination of Tan Shitian and Cheng Wei in the key guarding stage, which everyone expected.</p><br/><p>The two people refreshed on the Elf Fantasyland map. Tan Shitian quickly found Xie Shurong\u2019s position and relied on the bard\u2019s attack distance and quick archery to kill Xie Shurong.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong wasn\u2019t easily slaughtered. He learned from Vice-Captain Bai\u2019s \u2018I can still save myself\u2019 and deliberately moved around several big trees, interfering with Tan Shitian\u2019s field of view. Despite his low blood, he incredibly lived for a full half a minute.</p><br/><p>At the same time, he used the swordsman\u2019s pursuit footwork to rush to Cheng Wei. He used his remaining amount of blue to release the single attack skill, Devouring Soul Sword. The long sword in his hand stabbed straight forward and Cheng Wei\u2019s blood decreased by nearly 10%.</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei was grumpy after being hit. He thought in his heart, \u2018How come this tree isn\u2019t dead yet? Come on, die! I want to see Cat God!\u2019 Cheng Wei used the white magic attack skill God\u2019s Light to directly send Ah Shu away.</p><br/><p>[Only Dedication has killed Ah Shu!]</p><br/><p>This made the fans of the Time team cheer excitedly. The combination of Shu and Bai finally ended. It took so long to send away these cockroaches who wouldn\u2019t die. It wasn\u2019t easy!</p><br/><p>Once Xie Shurong died, he immediately ran to Bai Xuan and looked at him seriously. \u201cI only had a bit of blood left and decreased Cheng Wei\u2019s blood by 10%. Aren\u2019t I amazing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan couldn\u2019t help laughing. For such a big person, his IQ always returned to the kindergarten level. This expression of \u2018seeking praise\u2019 was even more childish than Zhuo Hang!</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan still extended a hand to touch Ah Shu\u2019s head and said, \u201cYou are really amazing, too powerful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong was comforted by these gentle hands. He pushed his head against Vice-Captain Bai\u2019s hand to maintain the touch. Vice-Captain Bai retracted his hand, making Xie Shurong feel inexplicably lost.</p><br/><p>If it wasn\u2019t for the presence of so many teammates, he would\u2019ve hugged Bai Xuan in his arms. This person was the kindest man he ever had contact with.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Once the Shu and Bai combination left the scene, the next stage was the exciting guard round.</p><br/><p>Everyone believed that Cat God would appear but they didn\u2019t know who Cat God would bring as a partner.</p><br/><p>In the VIP seats, Qin Mo couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cVice-Captain Ya, do you think Cat God will bring Old Zhang or Xiao Han?\u201d He personally hoped that Cat God would take Xiao Han to the field because he wanted to see more of this mixed-race boy\u2019s performance.</p><br/><p>Yan Ruiwen sat next to Qin Mo and immediately replied to the question. \u201cYou have to ask the captain. The captain can certainly guess it.\u201d He looked over at Ling Xuefeng as he said this. \u201cCaptain Ling, which partner do you think Cat God will take?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cHe will take Xiao Han.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mo looked at his master with surprise. \u201cWhy? Old Zhang is an old player. Wouldn\u2019t he be more stable in the competition?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng explained, \u201cZhang Jueming\u2019s auxiliary is more stable but Xiao Han\u2019s attack is stronger. It will be hard to play against the Tan Cheng combination without a melee. Besides, he will give new people more opportunities to train in the regular season.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mo suddenly realized, \u201cAh!\u201d</p><br/><p>If a dual remote combination was used against Tan Cheng, it would be easy to be dragged into Tan Shitian\u2019s pace because of the archer\u2019s far distance. Xiao Han\u2019s assassin was agile and he had the stealth skill. He could look for opportunities to interfere with the opponent\u2019s output, also giving Li Cangyu more opportunities to break out with his output. Ling Xuefeng\u2019s analysis was natural but it was more based on his understanding of Li Cangyu.</p><br/><p>The Canglan team\u2019s guard combination soon appeared on the big screen: Old Cat, Frost Descends.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, it was the combination of Cat God and the mixed-race teenager.</p><br/><p>Qin MO couldn\u2019t help lamenting. Master really understood Cat God. It would be good if he could guess Cat God\u2019s thoughts later in the game against Wind Colour.</p><br/><p>As Qin Mo thought this, Li Cangyu and Xiao Han had already appeared in the lower left corner of the map.</p><br/><p>The master and teacher had a high understanding. Xiao Han used the assassin\u2019s Nightfall stealth skill to walk in front. Li Cangyu followed him. In order to prevent the invisible assassin from being hit by Tan Shitian, Li Cangyu asked Xiao Han to change his route and go from the side.</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei and Tan Shitian saw that Li Cangyu was coming over. The elf summoner with the ID of Old Cat wore the uniform of the elves, which was white with green embellishments. It looked very chic and elegant.</p><br/><p>When he walked quickly, it was like a white and green wind blew in front of their eyes. This made the opponent difficult to accurately aim at his position.</p><br/><p>There were no pets beside him. Cheng Wei might be a fierce and impatient child but he was hit by Cat God\u2019s acting skills in the first team battle. He naturally learned his lesson and didn\u2019t act rashly.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu swayed in front of the two people for a while and found that Tan Cheng weren\u2019t acting. He doubtfully typed in the area channel: [Can\u2019t you see me?]</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018We can see you but don\u2019t want to hit you in case it is a trap!\u2019</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei endured the urge to go to his soundproof room to bite him. Then he asked Tan Shitian, \u201cDo we kill Xiao Han first?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian smiled and said, \u201cYes, wait for Xiao Han to show up first before killing him.\u201d</p><br/><p>The thoughts of the two men were very clear. They would first take care of the assassin that interfered with the remote output then deal with Cat God in a 2v1 manner. This would increase the odds.</p><br/><p>In order to prevent an assassin from going behind him, Tan Shitian quickly took a few steps in front of Cheng Wei and placed his back to Cheng Wei. They stood back to back, allowing Xiao Han no way to assassinate them. No matter which direction he came from, Tan Shitian or Cheng Wei could always see him.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu appreciated Tan Shitian\u2019s wit but Xiao Han wasn\u2019t in a rush. The audience could see that Xiao Han was hiding behind a tree not far away, waiting quietly for an opportunity.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu summoned the fire and thunder spirits.</p><br/><p>In order to prevent Xiao Han\u2019s assassination, Tan Shitian and Cheng Wei were in a back to back position. This allowed them to defend against Xiao Han but put them in Li Cangyu\u2019s attack range. Li Cangyu naturally wouldn\u2019t be polite. He used Thunder\u2019s Wrath to hit both of then and then fired a Fireball at Tan Shitian.</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei exclaimed, \u201cLet\u2019s hit back!\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei couldn\u2019t bear to be beaten anymore and used the big white magic spell, God\u2019s Faith!</p><br/><p>A white light beam fell from the sky and covered a five metre range around Li Cangyu. This white magic group attack skill had extremely high damage, forcing Li Cangyu to lose 30% blood and the fire spirit was directly killed.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu wasn\u2019t in a hurry. He summoned the water spirit and used the small attacks to consume Tan Shitian. The water spirit\u2019s attacks caused a deceleration effect along with the damage. Tan Shitian was hit by three consecutive attacks and the deceleration effect was overlapped. He couldn\u2019t keep up and Li Cangyu disappeared.</p><br/><p>Xiao Han still hadn\u2019t emerged but it wouldn\u2019t be easy to find an invisible assassin in the dense forest. Who knew where Xiao Han was hiding? It wasn\u2019t worthy it if they missed the chance to kill Cat God in order to block Xiao Han.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian took the initiative and ordered, \u201cKill Cat God first!\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei heard the captain\u2019s instructions and immediately let out God\u2019s Light and Voice of Combat! The series of white magic spells headed towards Li Cangyu. Tan Shitian followed by using big moves\u2014Shock Shot, Seize Life Shot, Death Arrow Rain!</p><br/><p>The Tan Cheng combination was really terrible. The white light effect of the spells and the green light of the bard\u2019s skills mixed together, bursting around Li Cangyu like fireworks.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu relied on his superb movement skills to avoid a few of them. However, he was still hit by the locked on attack and group skills, instantly lowering his blood!</p><br/><p>30%!</p><br/><p>Cat God\u2019s blood was very dangerous but to the surprise of the audience, he was still calm. Meanwhile, Xiao Han stayed hidden at a tree near Tan Cheng.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian knew clearly that Cat God had a plan with Xiao Han. However, he saw Cat God\u2019s blood in front of him and believed that no player in the league would let Cat God go!</p><br/><p>If he didn\u2019t kill the witty Cat God in one breath, he would be affected by the endless consequences.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian thought this and immediately pulled the longbow in his hand, using the bard\u2019s strongest single target attack skill, Precise Aim and Seize Life Shot!</p><br/><p>The bard\u2019s Precise Aim was like the killer\u2019s Death Mark. It was a skill that marked the opponent. Once the opponent was hit again, the damage of Seize Life Shot would double!</p><br/><p>This shot hit and Li Cangyu had only 10% blood left!</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei was excited and his heartbeat accelerated. Cat God\u2019s blood was flashing red and he would soon die! Could he finally kill Cat God in the arena?</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei thought this and immediately followed up with the big move Ice Storm.</p><br/><p>The Time fans were ready to cheer\u2026</p><br/><p>However, the prompt about Old Cat being killed didn\u2019t pop up on the screen.</p><br/><p>The audience took a closer look and found that there was a human type guard by Li Cangyu\u2019s side. The guard was wearing gold armour and holding a shield of light, looking majestic.</p><br/><p>The Time fans were stunned while Yu Bing smiled and explained, \u201cCat God rarely summons the guardian. In the previous second division, he basically only used the elf\u2019s water, fire and thunder spirits to kill the opponents. Today is the first time his guardian appeared on the field.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kou Hongyi also sighed. \u201cThe timing was excellent. Just after Tan Shitian\u2019s big move, Cat God chose to summon the guardian to forcibly resist the follow-up white magic.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Bing seemed to think of something, her eyes drifting for a moment before her spirit returned. \u201cSummoners have a total of seven pets. Four of them are race-specific pets and there are three public pets. In other words, skills that all summoners can learn. The guardian is public pet. Captain Ling\u2019s demon summoner and Qin Mo\u2019s blood kin summoner can also use it. However, public pets have few skills and summoning them consumes a lot of blue. In general, summoners prefer the racial pets and rarely call out the public pets.\u201d</p><br/><p>The public pets appeared too few times that Cheng Wei was careless and forgot that Li Cangyu had this guardian. The existence of the guardian was equivalent to three seconds of invincibility. Cheng Wei had just consumed a large amount of blue on Ice Storm only for it to be resisted.</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei wanted to spit out blood!</p><br/><p>To make matters worse, Xiao Han finally appeared!</p><br/><p>This boy had felt very suffocated. In accordance with his master\u2019s orders, he kept hiding and waited for an opportunity. It wasn\u2019t until Li Cangyu managed to successfully consume the two men\u2019s big moves that he decisively jumped towards Tan Shitian. He raised his dagger and used the blood kin assassin\u2019s set of moves to ruthlessly strike at Tan Shitian. Death Mark, Soul Stab, Arc Stab, Shadow Stab, Fatal Blow!</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian had been slowly grinded to half blood by Li Cangyu. Once Xiao Han unleashed these moves, Tan Shitian instantly fell to less than 10% blood!</p><br/><p>The blood of both captains flashed red and it depended on who would kill the other person first.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian immediately used Flying Feather Steps to quickly move away from Xiao Han. Xiao Han saw his actions and aimed at the nearby Cheng Wei. Cheng Wei had wanted to use God\u2019s Seal to control him but Xiao Han used Soul Stab to interrupt him.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian quickly ran out of Xiao Han\u2019s attack range and aimed his bow at Li Cangyu.</p><br/><p>He had been chasing Li Cangyu the whole time and only had a bit of blue left. It was enough to use one skill. However, Li Cangyu had less than 10% health left. As long as this skill hit, Cat God would die.</p><br/><p>Seize Life Shot!</p><br/><p>The bow string elongated and the arrow was about to be fired!</p><br/><p>The league\u2019s strongest archer, as long as this move hit, it was unquestionable that Li Cangyu would die.</p><br/><p>To the surprise of the audience\u2026 Tan Shitian wasn\u2019t able to shoot his arrow.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu had started summoning his fire spirit, water spirit, thunder spirit and wind spirit the moment Tan Shitian escaped from Xiao Han\u2019s attack.</p><br/><p>He methodically called out his four favourite elf pets and then pressed the R key on the keyboard.</p><br/><p>This was his summoner\u2019s big move. He didn\u2019t use it in the second division because the teams were weaker. Today, he was ready to bring back the big move to the Miracle League on the Time team\u2019s young captain.</p><br/><p>Cataclysm!</p><br/><p>Once this skill was pressed, there was a sudden explosion in the forest. It was a big water, fire, thunder and wind cataclysm that had the widest range and the most terrible damage.</p><br/><p>The water spirit\u2019s ice attribute attack, the fire spirit\u2019s Fireball, the thunder spirit\u2019s thunder strike and the wind spirit\u2019s wind attacks united together, resulting in an attack with multiple attributes and double the area damage!</p><br/><p>The moment this move was pressed, Tan Shitian hadn\u2019t fired the arrow yet and he fell to the ground in an instant.</p><br/><p>[Old Cat has killed Ten Days!]</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei was also uncomfortable. He was hit by Xiao Han and only had half his blood left. Then he was affected by Cat God\u2019s Cataclysm and his blood fell to 40%. His blood strip also started flashing red.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu ordered, \u201cXiao Han, I\u2019ll leave him to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once Cataclysm was used, all his skills were on cooldown. Li Cangyu immediately turned and hid behind a tree. Xiao Han immediately used a set of combos to wipe out Cheng Wei.</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei struggled to kill Li Cangyu and as a result, Li Cangyu hid behind a tree. Cheng Wei couldn\u2019t reach for a while and only had a bit of blood left once he finally arrived in front of Li Cangyu. He wanted to use a white magic spell to remove Cat God\u2019s residual blood but Li Cangyu reacted quickly. As soon as Cheng Wei appeared, he killed Xiao Wei with two common attacks that didn\u2019t require casting.</p><br/><p>[Old Cat has killed Only Dedication!]</p><br/><p>This scene was really unbearable. It was like Cheng Wei had a layer of blood left and took the initiative to run to Cat God to die\u2026</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei really wanted to vomit out blood.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t bear it anymore and typed on the area channel: [You are too cunning!]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled: [All is fair in war.]</p><br/><p>[\u2026] Cheng Wei sent a row of ellipses before spitting out: [Nasty Cataclysm!]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu sent a touching head emoji.</p><br/><p>On the big screen, the victory subtitle popped out. The match of Canglan VS Time was over and the score was determined to be 2:1.</p><br/><p>Many audience members couldn\u2019t recover their spirits.</p><br/><p>Yu Bing looked at the unexpected score and couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cCat God\u2019s Cataclysm, this is a big move that only elf summoners can use. It hasn\u2019t appeared in the Miracle League for three years\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She held back her tears and took a deep breath to calm herself down. \u201cThe conditions for Cataclysm are very harsh. First of all, the summoning and skills of the four pets can\u2019t be on cooldown. Secondly, the player must summon all four pets in a short amount of time and allow them to complete the Cataclysm combo. Once the Cataclysm combo is over, all pet skills are no longer available. This skill has many preconditions and there are serious consequences after its release. However, if the right timing is grasped, this powerful group attack skill is likely to reverse the situation in an instant.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kou Hongyi was dazed for a moment before covering. He sighed, \u201cThe elf summoner\u2019s Cataclysm, it had long been a legend by the time I entered the circle. Today I was fortunate enough to witness it. Sure enough, it is terrible!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu BIng smiled. \u201cThis is our strongest elf summoner Cat God. Only he can complete this complicated operation and use his four pets to achieve the best results.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kou Hongyi excitedly exclaimed, \u201cHe has been waiting for this opportunity for a long time. If we look at the replay, we can see that after the Tan Cheng combination, Cat God didn\u2019t summon his pets again. Instead, he relied on his flexible walking and movement skills to consume Tan Shitian. At the last moment, he released it to reverse the situation! Amazing!\u201d</p><br/><p>This evaluation was what many fans were feeling at this time.</p><br/><p>The Canglan was the away team against Time. Without knowing the mode and map selected, many fans felt that it was acceptable for Cat God to lose all three games. After all, the first match was an away match and there were many newcomers in the team\u2026</p><br/><p>However, Cat God relied on his delicate tactical layout and big output break at key moments to successfully reverse the situation twice, winning with an unexpected score of 2:1!</p><br/><p>Many of Li Cangyu\u2019s long-time loyal fans were so excited that they shed tears.</p><br/><p>After experiencing so many twists and turns, this man could still calmly handle the game, bring such wonderful and exciting scenes.</p><br/><p>Cataclysm, it was just a skill\u2026</p><br/><p>But only Li Cangyu had a good grasp of this skill.</p><br/><p>Many elf summoners in the online game would blindly use Cataclysm and then become a slaughtered fish afterwards. Some people were confused by the preconditions and often couldn\u2019t release it.</p><br/><p>Cat God was different. The cooldown time of each pet and how much blue was consumed by each skill. These materials were deeply imprinted in the depths of his bone marrow. Thus, he was able to easily use Cataclysm despite being away from Miracle for three years. Counterattacking at the last moment, this was Cat God\u2019s style.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The camera aimed at the Canglan team. Li Cangyu calmly stood up and spread open his arms with a smile. The four teenagers rushed to hold him and celebrate their first victory.</p><br/><p>Under the stage, Ling Xuefeng saw this scene and his eyes became hot.</p><br/><p>He still had some worries before the game. Perhaps Li Cangyu would be pressured by the newcomers and not play well? Facts proved that Li Cangyu was a strong and courageous captain. Regardless of the team battle mode or arena mode, he would smoothly finish the game according to his own ideas. Winning or losing didn\u2019t have an effect on his psychological state.</p><br/><p>He enjoyed the game and loved the Miracle League.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng saw Li Cangyu hugging the four newcomers in celebrating and couldn\u2019t help smiling slightly. The elf\u2019s Cataclysm that had disappeared for a long time finally appeared again. The player who once left with regret finally stood in the posture of the \u2018return of the king\u2019 in the Miracle League\u2019s seventh season.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

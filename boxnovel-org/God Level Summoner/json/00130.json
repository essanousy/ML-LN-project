He had been rained on before but never caught a cold. Yesterday afternoon, the Canglan team didn\u2019t have a match. Li Cangyu explored the vicinity to see if there was a good restaurant. In a few days, he would lead his teammates there to improve their meals. Then the weather in Guangzhou suddenly changed and he encountered a torrential rain when coming back. He was drenched like a drowned chicken. Combined with the low temperature of the hotel\u2019s air conditioner, he got a cold and sneezed when he woke up this morning.</p><br/><p>He had always been in good health and didn\u2019t pay much attention to it as he went to the venue with his teammates.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, his body became more uncomfortable in the afternoon. At this point, it was too late to change the members participating. Li Cangyu had to bear it but the reaction of his mind slowed down and his fingers couldn\u2019t keep up. His mistakes caused Canglan to lose two consecutive team battles.</p><br/><p>This result made Li Cangyu felt extremely guilty. He didn\u2019t expect that he would influence everyone like this.</p><br/><p>Once he returned to the hotel, he called the players to his room and frankly admitted his mistake. \u201cToday\u2019s team battle is my mistake. I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t get one work and wasted your hard work.\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice was hoarse like there was a large amount of sand in his throat. It was difficult to speak but he still gave an account to his teammates. The team members naturally didn\u2019t blame such a responsible captain. Instead, they felt distressed.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan looked at Li Cangyu with worry and said softly, \u201cYou are in a bad state, Don\u2019t blame yourself, we don\u2019t blame you. In any case, it is just the regular season. Losing a few points has little impact on us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong smiled and echoed the words. \u201cVice-Captain Bai is right. Cat God, don\u2019t mind it. This game was good practice.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming asked, \u201cHow are you feeling? Do you want to go to the hospital?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu waved his hand. \u201cI\u2019m fine, I just need to rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu saw the four youngster\u2019s worry for him and felt warm. He smiled and declared, \u201cI\u2019m really fine. It is just a small cold. If my cold isn\u2019t better by the next match tomorrow afternoon then\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu\u2019s eyes swept over the teammates in front of him before finally stopping on Zhang Jueming. \u201cOld Zhang, how about you arrange it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming was startled. \u201cMe?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou used to be captain and it isn\u2019t the first time you\u2019ve directed a match. I will let you arrange the next match.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t it be arranged by Vice-Captain Bai?\u201d Zhang Jueming looked back at Bai Xuan.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan touched his nose and muttered in an embarrassed manner, \u201cI can only add blood. I\u2019m not good at tactics.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu agreed. \u201cXiao Bai has never commanded. He is the healer and has to take care of everyone\u2019s blood. He will be too distracted to see the opposite side\u2019s situation. I will leave it to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming readily nodded. \u201cSince you believe in me so much, I will try it. Don\u2019t lecture me if I lose!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t happen.\u201d Li Cangyu smiled and patted him on the shoulder. \u201cYou arrange the next match with everyone. I have a headache and will go to sleep first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming quickly said, \u201cThen go to rest. We will go to Vice-Captain Bai\u2019s room to discuss it.\u201d He looked at the four teenagers and gestured. \u201cKids, let\u2019s go! Don\u2019t argue with Cat God!\u201d</p><br/><p>The four youngsters immediately followed behind Uncle Zhang.</p><br/><p>Xiao Han reached the door when he turned around and said, \u201cMaster, take a good rest. Qin Mo said you should drink hot water if you have a cold.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu waved at him. \u201cYes, go ahead.\u201d He paused before calling out, \u201cCome back!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han had just stepped out of the door and returned when he heard the words. \u201cMaster, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu wondered, \u201cYou seem to be getting along well with Qin Mo?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han nodded. \u201cYes, my Chinese is relatively poor. I have been chatting with Qin Mo every day to practice my grammar.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Was he sure that Qin Mo\u2019s Chinese was good?</p><br/><p>Xiao Han continued, \u201cMany people in the Wind Colour team watched today\u2019s match. Master made many mistakes in the game so once it ended, Qin Mo asked me what was going on. I told him that Master has a cold.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was no wonder why Ling Xuefeng called him. It seemed his confusing performance today was seen by many people in the league!</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was too lazy to worry about these things. He waved his hand and ordered, \u201cOkay, you can go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han turned and walked away, carefully closing the door for his master.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu touched his aching head, took off his coat and lay on the bed to sleep.</p><br/><p>He was sleeping so deeply that he didn\u2019t hear his phone ringing. Once he woke up, it was the next morning and he had a large number of missed calls. They were all from Cheng Wei.</p><br/><p>There were also several serial bombing messages: [Cat God, what\u2019s wrong? Your mistakes were a bit strange. Were you in bad shape?] [Cat God, why aren\u2019t you answering your phone?] [Cat God, Cat God! Cat God, read my messages and reply to me!]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu sent back: [I just woke up. It\u2019s nothing. I wasn\u2019t in good shape yesterday.]</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t want to tell Cheng Wei about the cold. Once he knew, it might spread through the entire Miracle League. There was no need to make such a big fuss for a small cold.</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei saw the text message and immediately replied: [You\u2019re not in good shape? Then take a break! Don\u2019t be too tired! Your body is your asset!]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu looked at the row of exclamation points and helplessly replied: [I know.]</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei, this guy always had an excitable personality but his concern was particularly direct.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu put down his phone and went to the bathroom to wash his face.</p><br/><p>His headache was still very strong and he was slightly dizzy. The confusion was like his mind had become messy paste and his thoughts were sluggish. He took a long time to send the text message because his fingers weren\u2019t too stable. It seemed that he really couldn\u2019t play today\u2019s match. Fortunately he let Old Zhang arrange it yesterday.</p><br/><p>He just thought this when Zhang Jueming opened the door and saw that he got up. Zhang Jueming placed a bowl of rice porridge and a bag of buns on the table, stating, \u201cVice-Captain Bai had me bring you breakfast. Wash your face and eat a bit. How are you? Is it better?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu didn\u2019t want his teammates to worry so he reluctantly smiled. \u201cIt is much better. Don\u2019t worry about me and go play the game.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming asked, \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to watch?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m a bit tired and will take the day off at the hotel. Please tell everyone else.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming nodded. \u201cOkay, have a good rest. I\u2019ll take them to lunch first then we will head to the venue after eating.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu said, \u201cI\u2019ll cheer for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once Zhang Jueming left, Li Cangyu sat on the bed and saw the bowl of porridge and hot steamed buns on the table. He didn\u2019t eat dinner last night and still didn\u2019t have an appetite. He opened the porridge to take a look and didn\u2019t feel like eating. He just went back to bed to sleep.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The Canglan team ate lunch at the hotel. Zhang Jueming explained while eating, \u201cThe arena will be Xiao Zhuo and Xiao Li. Cat God won\u2019t be in the team battle. This means that Xiao Li will play and be the main output. Everyone will protect you. Just read your spells with confidence. Everyone should remember how to split up based on our discussion last night. Remember to listen to my commands.\u201d</p><br/><p>The youngsters nodded while Ah Shu and Bai Xuan didn\u2019t have much opinion.</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming had left the Miracle League for many years but he was once an aspiring captain. He wanted to win the championship to prove his strength but unfortunately had to leave.</p><br/><p>When he was young, he worked hard to study the various pairings and styles of Miracle. Despite leaving for several years, these things were deeply engraved into his bone marrow and were still as clear as yesterday.</p><br/><p>He was a person who had been a captain. He was very different from a temporary commander.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan listened to his quick analysis of the tactics and the lineup arrangement and felt relief for Li Cangyu. Li Cangyu carried everything in the old Canglan team. Now they had Old Zhang. If Li Cangyu felt uncomfortable, he could share some of the pressure.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan\u2019s healing level was first-class but he wasn\u2019t proficient in tactics. Ah Shu\u2019s personal strength was high but he didn\u2019t have many ideas when it came to commanding the team battles. At the crucial moment, Old Zhang could control the scene for the Canglan team.</p><br/><p>Once they finished eating, Zhang Jueming headed to the arena with his teammates. They had just walked to the hotel\u2019s lobby when they saw an unexpected figure\u2014Ling Xuefeng.</p><br/><p>The man was wearing a black trench coat and there was no expression on his handsome face. He stood there as if waiting for someone.</p><br/><p>Once he saw the group, he immediately strode to Bai Xuan and asked, \u201cWhere is your captain?\u201d</p><br/><p>The startled Bai Xuan replied, \u201cHe is resting in his room.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng demanded, \u201cWho lives with him? Give me your door card.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan had some doubts. \u201cCaptain Ling, did you come here looking for Cat God?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng didn\u2019t give much explanation. He just made a sound of agreement and said, \u201cGive me the door card. I will go straight to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming thought it was strange but it wasn\u2019t easy to refuse. He pulled out his door card from his pocket and handed it to him.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng turned and left, leaving the stunned group behind him.</p><br/><p>A moment later, Xie Shurong couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cHow can Ling Xuefeng appear here? Why is he looking for Cat God?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t be curious. He is familiar with our captain and probably has something to discuss.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong stared at Ling Xuefeng\u2019s disappearing back and thoughtfully touched his chin. Bai Xuan saw him staring at Ling Xuefeng waiting by the elevator and pulled his arm. \u201cLet\u2019s go and play. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ah Shu was towed away by the vice-captain and other people had to follow.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t ask on the surface but curiosity filled their hearts. Why did Ling Xuefeng suddenly come to the hotel to find Cat God? Shouldn\u2019t he be in Shanghai?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

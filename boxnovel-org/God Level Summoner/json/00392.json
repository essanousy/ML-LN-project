No one could lead a team the entire time. As captain, it was their duty to take care of the team\u2019s future before leaving.</p><br/><p>Thanks to Yan Ruiwen\u2019s tip, Ling Xuefeng called the airport to change their flight back to China. They stayed in the Maldives for another day before flying back to Shanghai.</p><br/><p>As a result, they just came out of Shanghai Airport when they were surrounded by a group of reporters.. It seemed the perseverance of these reporters were extraordinary. Yesterday was a waste and they willingly ran to the airport today to wait.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng saw the reporters and immediately pulled Li Cangyu towards the parking lot.</p><br/><p>The reporters chased after them. \u201cCaptain Ling, I heard that you went to the Maldives with Cat God. Is this true?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you worried about the photo on Weibo?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201dWhat is the relationship between the two of you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201dHave you been together a long time ago?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng calmly ignored the reporters and quickly took Li Cangyu to the parking lot.</p><br/><p>Yan Ruiwen and Qin Mo had said they would come to the airport to pick up their captain. They were shocked by this sight but fortunately, Yan Ruiwen responded quickly enough. He immediately started the car and parked in front of Ling Xuefeng. Qin Mo opened the window and called out, \u201cMaster, Cat God, get on!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu and Ling Xuefeng didn\u2019t say anything. They just jumped into the car and closed the door. Then the car shot out of the parking lot like an arrow.</p><br/><p>Yan Ruiwen\u2019s driving skills weren\u2019t bad and he moved through the airport quickly, soon leaving the reporters far behind.</p><br/><p>LIng Xuefeng looked in the rearview mirror and found that cars weren\u2019t tracking them. He let go of his worries and asked Yan Ruiwen, \u201cWhat is the trend of public opinion? Are the Wind Colour fans reacting in a big manner?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Ruiwen glanced at Li Cangyu. His expression was a bit awkward and he hesitated to open his mouth.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng told him, \u201cCat God isn\u2019t an outsider. You can say it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Yan Ruiwen coughed and explained, \u201cMany fans still don\u2019t believe the two of you are together. Most of them are in a wait and see state. Some more radical fans are filling the Wind Colour team\u2019s official website\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As he said this, Yan Ruiwen stopped and glanced at Cat God\u2019s face in the mirror. The man\u2019s face didn\u2019t show the slightest embarrassment and he was very calm. He was worthy of being the captain of the national team. He was used to big waves and this rumour didn\u2019t have a drastic effect on him.</p><br/><p>During the holiday, the two people had a lot of courage because they were abroad. They didn\u2019t avoid the eyes of other tourists. In particularly, they did many kssing actions when sunbathing on the beach in the afternoon. Discerning people knew they weren\u2019t related and most people guessed their relationship.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu wasn\u2019t worried about this. He didn\u2019t kill or set fire to anything. He didn\u2019t do anything wrong. He was just in a relationship with someone he loved. Besides, they weren\u2019t stars in the entertainment circle who relied on popularity to eat. The personal impact of their romance being exposed wasn\u2019t big. The key was the team.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng\u2019s thoughts were the same. The two people exchanged a look and Ling Xuefeng gently held Li Cangyu\u2019s hand. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, I will face it with you. If the reporters are too much then we will admit it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mo\u2019s mood was very complicated as he listened from the front seat. The holiday passed and Master got together with Cat God? Or had they secretly been together a long time ago?</p><br/><p>Thinking carefully, the latter was more likely. Since Cat God\u2019s return, Master had changed. He sent Xiao Han to Qin Mo as a sparring partner and the usually serious and tough man would always listen to Cat God. This was the reason why Cat God stood at the top of the food chain!</p><br/><p>Qin Mo had a feeling of dawning realization.</p><br/><p>He looked at the two people sitting next to each other and holding hands, only having each other in their eyes and not caring about the two big light bulbs that were Vice-Captain Yan and Qin Mo. Qin Mo felt a bit awkward but\u2026 the two of them really matched.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Yan Ruiwen drove Ling Xuefeng back to his home in Shanghai. This was the first time Qin Mo came to Master\u2019s house but Cat God was familiar with it and had clearly been here more than once.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng invited the two men in. Yan Ruiwen seemed to have expected this while Qin Mo was flattered. He followed Master into the living room and had just sat down when he heard Ling Xuefeng say, \u201cI called you in here because I have something to tell you. I plan to officially retire next season.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mo looked up with surprise. \u201cMaster, you want to retire?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Ruiwen was calm. \u201cYou have already thought about it, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Ling Xuefeng explained, \u201cI\u2019ve thought about it for a long time and it isn\u2019t a whim. After this Spring Festival, I will be 26 years old and it is time to leave the league. The overall configuration of the Wind Colour team is very mature. Even if I retire, there is the double summoner team of Qin Mo and Xu Feifan while you and Guo Xuan are still young. The team\u2019s lineup doesn\u2019t need to change very much and I am reassured that you will take care of the Wind Colour team.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Ruiwen nodded. \u201cI will support Captain\u2019s decision.\u201d</p><br/><p>After all, Qin Mo was still young. He couldn\u2019t accept this fact for a while and his eyes were a bit red.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng glanced at his apprentice and spoke softly, \u201cQin Mo, you have been growing up under my protection but people who depend on their masters won\u2019t have too much to offer. In the past, Xu Luo and Song Yang retired and there is no Tan Shitian and Su Guangmo. Master hopes that one day, you will become a true first-class player.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I know.\u201d Qin Mo\u2019s voice was a bit choked up. In fact, he always had a feeling that Master would leave after the World Competition but he didn\u2019t think about it too carefully. He didn\u2019t expect this day to come so quickly and was at a bit of a loss.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu saw this little one\u2019s red eyes and couldn\u2019t help walking over to touch his head. \u201cDon\u2019t be too sad. You are only 18 years old and your road is still long. Your master can\u2019t cover you all the time. There is a day when you will have to rely on yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mo nodded with red eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take to the manager later. Once I retire, Vice-Captain Yan will take over as captain.\u201d Ling Xuefeng glanced at Yan Ruiwen. \u201cYou are familiar with the captains of the major teams and I will hand Wind Colour over to you. As for the vice-captain\u2026 Qin Mo is still young. He can start as vice-captain and slowly learn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Qin Mo was a bit surprised. He couldn\u2019t believe that Master would make him the vice-captain. He was a young player and Guo Xuan and Xu Feifan were obviously older and more qualified\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it is you.\u201d Ling Xuefeng saw his apprentice\u2019s doubts and spoke firmly, \u201cYour talent hasn\u2019t been fully awakened and your room for progress is very larger. You should learn from your predecessors and being vice-captain is also a type of experience.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Qin Mo gazed at his master in a serious manner. \u201cI will study hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>His master valued him so much that he naturally couldn\u2019t let his master down.</p><br/><p>As Cat God said, he was only 18 years old and his road was still long. He couldn\u2019t always hide under Master\u2019s protection. One day, he would grow up and he needed to solve all difficulties on his own.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng smiled slightly and patted Qin Mo\u2019s shoulder. \u201cRefuel.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Compared to the calm Wind Colour team, the Canglan team was like an exploded pot.</p><br/><p>The moment Li Cangyu returned to the club, he was stopped by Gu Siming. The boy\u2019s eyes were wide and curious as he asked, \u201cCat God, did you really go to the Maldives with Captain Ling?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Li Cangyu honestly admitted it. Gu Siming kept on wanting to ask questions but was interrupted by Li Cangyu. \u201cCall everyone to the meeting room.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was only after all the players were gathered that he announced his retirement.</p><br/><p>To make matters worse, Bai Xuan also said he didn\u2019t want to continue playing the game. Gu Siming was crying while Li Xiaojiang lowered his head and didn\u2019t speak. However, Zhuo Hang and Xiao Han were calm.</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang was calm because he already guessed this point. Cat God\u2019s return to Miracle was only for one season. There weren\u2019t many old players in the e-sports circle and Cat God persisted until now. It wasn\u2019t easy to lead the national team to win the World Competition and it was the end of his career.</p><br/><p>The reason why Xiao Han was calm was because Qin Mo had privately told him that their two masters were leaving and he was fully prepared.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu asked, \u201cWhat about Old Zhang?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming laughed. \u201cI am older than the two of you. Going back to my studio is more reliable.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was literally a blow. Three out of the eight team members were leaving at once\u2026</p><br/><p>Originally, Xie Shurong had been holding onto Vice-Captain Bai but now he was the oldest on the team. It wasn\u2019t appropriate for him to act spoiled. The teenagers didn\u2019t speak and it was up to Xie Shurong to break the awkward atmosphere. \u201cIt is normal for teams to change between old and new players. Since the three of them have made plans, we shouldn\u2019t stop them. Don\u2019t be too depressed. Cat God should have a plan.\u201d He glanced back at Li Cangyu and asked, \u201cCat God, I think you should have a plan for what comes next?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, the captain will be Ah Shu. You are the oldest and have played abroad. Your competition experience is very rich and I believe you can bring Canglan up. As for the other players, I have already spoken to Liu Chuan and he will pick a few talented newcomers from the training camp.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d Xie Shurong promised. \u201cI will do my best to lead the team well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu nodded and patted Gu Siming and Li Xiaojiang\u2019s head. \u201cDon\u2019t cry. I have retired but that doesn\u2019t mean I am leaving the club. I will continue to stay and watch your training.\u201d</p><br/><p>This reassuring sentence made them feel a lot better.</p><br/><p>Gu Siming raised his head. \u201cThen Cat God will stay as a coach?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang also looked at Li Cangyu with red eyes. \u201cReally, really continue to stay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Li Cangyu smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will also come over often.\u201d Zhang Jueming laughed heartily. \u201cMy studio is running smoothly so call me whenever you need me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay as well.\u201d Bai Xuan smiled gently. \u201cI plan to settle in Changsha in the future. I can come to see you at any time and will cook for you when I\u2019m free.\u201d In fact, he had another reason for staying. He was reluctant to leave Xie Shurong.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong glanced at him and smiled, causing Bai Xuan to look away with a bit of embarrassment.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu looked at Zhuo Hang. \u201cThe vice-captain will be Zhuo Hang.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang was startled before his senses returned and he replied seriously, \u201cRest assured Cat God. I will work with Brother Shu and study hard. If I don\u2019t understand anything then I will ask you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled. \u201cYes, that\u2019s good.\u201d</p><br/><p>This teenager still looked a bit immature but he was committed.</p><br/><p>The reason for giving it to Zhuo Hang was because Zhuo Hang was calmer in front of his reporters and his progress in his season was obvious to all. Xiao Han was very talented in the game but his Chinese standards were a bit worrying. Let him adapt for a while and once Ah Shu retired in the future, Xiao Han would directly serve as the captain.</p><br/><p>However, Li Cangyu couldn\u2019t predict a few years later. He could only make the best arrangements now.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The atmosphere in the meeting room was heavy but in the afternoon, Li Cangyu brought them good news. Liu Chuan had carefully selected three talented newcomers from the training camp. They happened to be a summoner, healer and assistant.</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan obviously had long-term vision and expected Li Cangyu, Bai Xuan and Zhang Jueming to retire at the end of the season. After all, they only signed for one year. Liu Chuan had prepared the candidates to replace them in advance.</p><br/><p>The three teenagers were all around 18 years old. Along with Gu Siming, Xiao Han, Zhuo Hang and Li Xiaojiang, Ah Shu would have a hard time playing with many players. However, once they grew up, Canglan would be able to maintain the status of a strong team for a long time in the future.</p><br/><p>A team of all young people might lack experience but they could last for a long time.</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan\u2019s goal of entering Miracle had a perfect start. Li Cangyu\u2019s dream of winning the championship had also been fulfilled. From the time of the initial cooperation, Li Cangyu knew they would be strong together and wouldn\u2019t be defeated.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu watched the young and energetic people in the training room and smiled happily.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

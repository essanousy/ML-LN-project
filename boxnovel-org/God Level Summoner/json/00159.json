This was their first home game in Changsha and many fans came to the venue. They saw the eight members appear and the audience stood up, deafening applause and screams filling the venue. Many fans raised the fluorescent cards that they specifically made.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu looked at the crowd and the shiny fluorescent cards with the player IDs. He smiled and took the microphone, saying simply, \u201cThank you for the support and for coming to watch this match!\u201d</p><br/><p>More than 80% of the audience members willing to buy tickets were iron fans. No matter which team members came, the warm atmosphere of the venue made the team members feel that this was a real home match!</p><br/><p>At an away game, the audience were cheering for the other team. At Changsha, it became the world of the Canglan team! Canglan might be a new team just set up this season but the enthusiasm of fans were undiminished. This made Li Cangyu feel very moved.</p><br/><p>The former Canglan team didn\u2019t have so many fans and their results were bad. Sometimes a home match would only have half the seats filled. Had it ever been as full as today?</p><br/><p>It was the first time he experienced the strong supporting atmosphere of a home match.</p><br/><p>He had taken full advantage of the home game mode and map selection and was able to score 2:1 against a first-tier team in the Miracle League. Li Cangyu was actually very satisfied.</p><br/><p>The fans were obviously happy as well and game the team members a standing ovation.</p><br/><p>The applause and cheers lasted a long time. Li Cangyu had everyone bow to the audience and then moved backstage, ready to be interviewed by the reporters.</p><br/><p>Of course, it was customary for the losing team to be interviewed first.</p><br/><p>On the Flying Feathers side, Su Guangmo took Yu Pingsheng and Xiao Mu with him. Yu Pingsheng sat next to him and listened from beginning to end. The Flying Feathers fans had been long accustomed to this. Yu Pingsheng would become part of the background in interviews.</p><br/><p>The focus of the reporters\u2019 questions was naturally the captain of Flying Feathers Su Guangmo. \u201cCaptain Su, what do you think about Cat God\u2019s arrangement of three arena games today?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo be honest, I wanted to vomit out blood when I saw it.\u201d Su Guangmo replied very honestly. \u201cBefore the match, we worked hard preparing for a team battle. The result was completely unusable. I can only say that\u2026 Cat God is too playful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Many reporters laughed. Captain Su was always straightforward when being interviewed. He wanted to say that he was miserable today due to Cat God and frankly told the reporters.</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo paused for a moment before continuing, \u201cOf course, Cat God\u2019s idea is correct. I think this match will certainly provide new ideas to the captains of major teams. I have to learn to dig a pit for others at Flying Feathers\u2019 next home match. Flying Feathers\u2019 next opponent is Time. I have decided to choose three team battles so that Tan Shitian and Cheng Wei can\u2019t appear in the arena together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei immediately jumped up in front of the TV. \u201cDamn Su Guangmo, do you really want to be like this? Why are you retaliating against us because of Cat God?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian hurriedly patted him on the shoulder. \u201cHe is just talking nonsense. Do you really believe it? It is impossible to expose the mode selection before the match.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei froze and felt that his IQ had been insulted.</p><br/><p>Then a reporter asked, \u201cCaptain Su, today the score was 1:2 in the away match. Is this what you expected?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo smiled helplessly. \u201cThere were too many unexpected factors in the game. I\u2019m not satisfied with the score. Of course, this is the fun of competitive gaming. If we win then we can also lose. There is no need to fret over a score of 1:2.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng nodded.</p><br/><p>The reporter handed the microphone to Xiao Mu. \u201cXiao Mu, how did you feel when you were killed in seconds by Cat God\u2019s wind spirit?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Xiao Mu touched his nose. \u201cI can probably use the phrase \u2018messy in the wind\u2019 to describe it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters laughed but Xiao Han thoughtfully watched the broadcast and wrote down \u2018messy in the wind\u2019. He planned to go back and ask Qin Mo about the usage.</p><br/><p>The reporter asked, \u201cAre you satisfied with your performance in today\u2019s match?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Mu replied, \u201cThis is the first time I played in the arena. I wasn\u2019t comfortable and didn\u2019t have an understanding with my teammates. I feel that many of our members only played with 80% of their strength today. I hope that the next Flying Feathers match can make everyone more excited.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng nodded again in agreement.</p><br/><p>The reporters, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Vice-Captain Yu, he was a really dedicated background board. He would also nod in agreement!</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo saw that Yu Pingsheng was nodding and handed the microphone to him, instructing him to say a few words. Yu Pingsheng thought for a while before saying, \u201cWe will refuel.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters saw his serious expression and wanted to laugh. The vice-captain took so long just to say such a sentence!</p><br/><p>Fortunately, a witty reporter immediately changed the topic and continued to ask Su Guangmo, \u201cCaptain Su, how do you evaluate the performance of your younger brother Xie Shurong in today\u2019s match?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think that Ah Shu has improved a lot compared to when he was in Flying Feathers. He still has some impulses but he has become very calm and patient. He knows how to cooperate with his teammates and how to adjust the rhythm. I think he played very well today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo was very generous. Yu Pingsheng sat quietly beside him and nodded from time to time. Gradually, the reporters treated him as a ghost. He seemed use to it and continued to be in the background.</p><br/><p>Some newcomers to Flying Feathers wanted to ask, \u2018If Vice-Captain Yu doesn\u2019t like to talk, why does Captain Su take him to every interview? Isn\u2019t it embarrassing to sit next to him?\u2019</p><br/><p>Flying Feathers\u2019 veteran fans would definitely say, \u201cIt is because Vice-Captain Yu is Captain Su\u2019s sidekick and follows him everywhere!\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact, only people who knew the inside story knew that Su Guangmo took Yu Pingsheng everywhere because he was worried that if Yu Pingsheng was left alone, his symptoms would get worse.</p><br/><p>He took Yu Pingsheng with him everywhere so that Yu Pingsheng could communicate with others. After many years, Yu Pingsheng\u2019s communication disorder symptoms had improved. At the very least, he wasn\u2019t afraid of photographer\u2019s camera and wouldn\u2019t hide fearfully.</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo finished answering questions and left the interview room with Yu Pingsheng and Xiao Mu.</p><br/><p>On the way back, Su Guangmo watched the silent Yu Pingsheng and couldn\u2019t help holding his hand and asking, \u201cThere were many people in the room. Was it a bit stuffy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng was silent for a moment before nodding softly. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo smiled and placed an arm around his shoulder. \u201cIt is our first time in Changsha. I will take you for a walk.\u201d He turned back and said, \u201cAh Mu, go to the team and tell them it is a break tonight. Everyone is free to play but pay attention to safety.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Mu seemed used to the captain sneaking away with the vice-captain and nodded calmly before walking away.</p><br/><p>The Shu Yu duo was walking when they suddenly saw Ah Shu and Bai Xuan coming around the corner. Xie Shurong was talking and laughing with Bai Xuan. He saw his two brothers and immediately walked over. \u201cBrothers, are you going back to the hotel?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo replied, \u201cWe aren\u2019t going back yet. We want to explore Changsha. Are there any places you would recommend?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong said, \u201cI\u2019m not familiar with this place.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan smiled and recommended several places. He also told them a few restaurants with good reviews. \u201cIf you want to eat authentic Hunan cuisine, you can go to the places I mentioned. There is also delicious crayfish. Is Captain Su interested?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo answered, \u201cForget the crayfish. I will go and try Hunan cuisine. Thank you!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them walked away and Xie Shurong smiled. \u201cVice-Captain Bai, you are really considerate. Thank you for recommending places to eat for my brothers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong laughed. \u201cIt is better to hug you as thanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he hugged Bai Xuan with a cheeky expression. Bai Xuan was dumbfounded. \u201cI don\u2019t want this way of thanks!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong had to let go, his deep eyes watching Bai Xuan closely.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan felt puzzled and couldn\u2019t help reaching out to touch the young man\u2019s forehead. \u201cDo you have a fever again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong smiled slightly and thought, \u2018I don\u2019t have a fever. I just like you and want to hold you, so I found a shameless excuse.\u2019</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan would definitely want to kill Xie Shurong if he knew these crooked thoughts.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong didn\u2019t say anything before smiling in a handsome manner. Then he whispered into Bai Xuan\u2019s ears, \u201cI was just testing my charm to see if your heartbeat will speed up when I hug you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan rolled his eyes. \u201cYou can roll out of here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong immediately squatted and held his head. He looked up at Bai Xuan and asked sincerely, \u201cShould I rolls sideways or the other way?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He really couldn\u2019t be helped! How on earth did he become so shameless?</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Li Cangyu came over with the others at this time. Bai Xuan immediately turned and greeted him. Li Cangyu said, \u201cWe should go quickly. We can\u2019t let the reporters wait too long.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han found Ah Shu crouching on the ground and asked curiously, \u201cWhat happened to Ah Shu?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong stood up and patted his trousers while explaining, \u201cThere was something on the ground. I picked it up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han continued to ask, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong said, \u201cMy thick face.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He was quite self-aware!</p><hr/><br/>\n</div>"}

The strength of the Chinese team was stronger than he imagined. The more terrifying thing was that regardless of whether they were Cat Bai, Lou Zhang, Tan Cheng or Su Yu, all combinations players quite well in today\u2019s match and there were no obvious mistakes.</p><br/><p>This low error rate made the French team\u2019s idea of turning over the disadvantage became a luxury that couldn\u2019t be achieved at all.</p><br/><p>In any case, Stein couldn\u2019t take the initiative to surrender and could only send the French team\u2019s third pair.</p><br/><p>On the big screen, the guard combination appeared. The team\u2019s vice-captain, swordsman Lemande and the black magician Jacob. This was one of the most powerful combinations in the French team and Stein placing them in the guard position showed his trust in them.</p><br/><p>The French audience was still expecting the two of them to reverse the situation but Stein had lost confidence in this game. Unless the Chinese team deliberately threw the game or suddenly dropped the chain, there was no way the Chinese team could lose with such a great advantage.</p><br/><p>Facts proved that Su Guangmo and Yu Pingsheng couldn\u2019t throw the game.</p><br/><p>After taking care of the second combination, Su Guangmo still had half blood left while Yu Pingsheng\u2019s blood was above 80%. The berseker had high defense and his high blood would make it harder to fight.</p><br/><p>The third stage started. Yu Pingsheng took the initiative to protect his brother. The moment the other swordsman came close, he didn\u2019t hesitate to raise his knife and use Mountain Chop.</p><br/><p>This skill made a deep gully in the ground and isolated the French team\u2019s swordsman from the black magician. Yu Pingsheng left the swordsman for his brother and quickly rushed to the black magician.</p><br/><p>Yu Bing explained, \u201cVice-Captain Yu is obviously separating the two French players to maintain the advantage. Captain Su is ranked higher in the world than the French swordsman Lemande and isn\u2019t afraid of him in 1v1. Meanwhile, Vice-Captain Yu has extremely high defense and can drag things out a while against the black magician.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kou Hongyi was excited. \u201cVice-Captain Yu is actually very smart! Ignore the fact that he doesn\u2019t like to talk. On the field, his carefulness, sensitivity and excellent tactical awareness are no worse than Su Guangmo\u2019s!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng\u2019s practice of splitting the battlefield coincided with Su Guangmo\u2019s thoughts. The brothers shared a heart and split the French team up into 1v1.</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo aimed for the French team\u2019s vice-captain, Lemande and his swordsmanship dazzled the eyes.</p><br/><p>The gorgeous swordsmanship collided with each other and the skill life effect blinded people. Su Guangmo replied on his flexible movements to avoid Lemande\u2019s key control. He used Light and Shadow Rotation before folow up with three moves to force Lemande down to half blood.</p><br/><p>Next to him, Yu Pingsheng wasn\u2019t willing to show any weakness. He might\u2019ve lost a lot of blood due to the black magician but he used a key opportunity to open a big move. He jumped in front of the black magician and the axe in his hand moved decisively. The magician\u2019s skills were interrupted and he followed with Cut Through Thorns, Breaking Bone and Spitting Wind Chop to cut the opponent\u2019s blood in half!</p><br/><p>The Su Yu combination\u2019s fierce play really surprised the two players of the French team.</p><br/><p>In the domestic live broadcast room, fans of Flying Feathers were crazily commenting to encourage the Su Yu combination.</p><br/><p>[Captain Su is teaching the French team\u2019s Lemande how to be a man!] [They are both swordsmen. Why is the gap so big?] [Vice-Captain Yu is domineering and mighty. The black magician can\u2019t take care of his health!]</p><br/><p>The Su Yu combination had always been tough. They weren\u2019t afraid even when their blood was behind the other side and would rush to the other side to play a beautiful combo.</p><br/><p>The Chinese team\u2019s advantage in the arena was further expanded.</p><br/><p>Kou Hongyi couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cSurely this game won\u2019t be another four against six? It would be too humiliating for the French team\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Bing calmly told him, \u201cThe possibility isn\u2019t big since Su Yu don\u2019t have much blue left.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kou Hongyi looked closely at their remaining blue and agreed. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Lemande also hasn\u2019t opened his big moves yet. It is estimated that Captain Su won\u2019t last much longer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Captain Su might not have much blue left but he still had his ordinary attacks.</p><br/><p>Using ordinary attacks to create combos was the signature style of his younger brother, Xie Shurong. The effect when Su Guangmo used it wasn\u2019t bad. He waved the sword in his hand and achieved five consecutive combos, lowering Lemande\u2019s blood to 30%.</p><br/><p>Lemande was almost breathless under the attack from the other side.</p><br/><p>This was the pressure from the world\u2019s strongest swordsman!</p><br/><p>Finally, Su Guangmo\u2019s swordsmanship stagnated and Lemande found an opportunity. He unleashed a wave of counterattacks to kill the bloody Su Guangmo.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, it was too late\u2026</p><br/><p>It was almost impossible for the French team to make a comeback in this residual blood state.</p><br/><p>Lemande looked at the situation of his teammate and felt even more desperate. Yu Pingsheng\u2019s berserker had half his blood left while the black magician fell from full blood to half blood.</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng saw that his brother was killed and didn\u2019t hesitate to use his last big move, World Without Justice!</p><br/><p>The ultimate move of the berserker consumed all his remaining blue but it also caused considerable damage. The black magician\u2019s health was cut to 25% from this move!</p><br/><p>Lemande no longer hesitated. He moved closer and released a set of moves to reduce Yu Pingsheng to residual blood. Jacob also used Death Mantra and Shadow Winding to curse Yu Pingsheng to death!</p><br/><p>The Su Yu combination was sent off while the domestic audience wrote \u20186666\u2019 to cheer for them.</p><br/><p>Their performance was truly very powerful. Not only did they successfully kill the French team\u2019s second combination, they forced the guard combination to a bloody state. This laid a solid foundation for the Chinese team\u2019s victory.</p><br/><p>The Chinese team\u2019s guard combination would determine the outcome of the game. As long as the Chinese team didn\u2019t make any catastrophic mistakes, they would definitely win this game.</p><br/><p>The audience started speculating. [Who will be the guard? Could it be the Yan Guo double magicians?] [Not necessarily, it could be the Jiang Zhou double hunters!] [No matter who you are, don\u2019t throw the game! Win well, thank you!]</p><br/><p>The moment the IDs of the Chinese team\u2019s guard combination appeared on the screen, the audience let out a serious of ellipses.</p><br/><p>\u2014Ling Xuefeng and Qin Mo!</p><br/><p>Out of the 22 members of the national team, even if everyone else\u2019s IQ dropped, Ling Xuefeng absolutely couldn\u2019t make mistakes. The rigorous and calm man never made two mistakes in a game since he debuted. On the contrary, he led Wind Colour to victory many times. He wouldn\u2019t give any opportunities to the opponents and would seize advantage of the opponent\u2019s gaps to deal a fatal blow!</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng was sent as a guard and it could be seen that Li Cangyu thought this arena was inevitable.</p><br/><p>The live broadcast room celebrated the Chinese team\u2019s victory in advance. [Congratulations on the Chinese team for winning two games!] \u201c[Congratulations to the national team for winning two arena games!] [Congratulations to a good start!] [Congratulations to Captain Ling for holding the arena!]</p><br/><p>This arena game had no results yet but the audience was celebrating. It was clear that in everyone\u2019s mind, there was absolutely no suspense once Ling Xuefeng appeared as the guard.</p><br/><p>The always calm Yu Bing said, \u201cWe can celebrate the victory of this game in advance. Cat God is obviously trying to get rid of the French team today. He sent a luxurious lineup to both arena games!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe French team\u2019s confidence will probably collapse after this game.\u201d Kou Hongyi gloated. \u201cCaptain Ling can directly collect heads while Qin Mo can act as soy sauce and watch the fun next to his master.\u201d</p><br/><p>It turned out that Qin Mo didn\u2019t play as a soy sauce.</p><br/><p>In the final round, Ling Xuefeng and Qin Mo refreshed outside the woods. Ling Xuefeng looked at the position of the French team on the map and ordered simply, \u201cEnter stealth and kill them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mo nodded. \u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wind Colour\u2019s little prince quickly lurked through the woods. Ling Xuefeng didn\u2019t follow and moved his own way forward.</p><br/><p>The audience thought that the teacher and apprentice would act from the left and right. However, Ling Xuefeng didn\u2019t do anything when Qin Mo moved behind the swordsman and broke out.</p><br/><p>He was standing and watching the excitement?</p><br/><p>Compared with Ling Xuefeng\u2019s calm, Qin Mo was very active. As soon as he reached the swordsman, he summoned a blood spider to set the other person in place, followed by the blood spider.</p><br/><p>In any case, the other swordsman wasn\u2019t a rookie. He immediately broke out but could only escape from the blood spider\u2019s control. He had already been bitten to three layers of bleeding by the blood snake.</p><br/><p>The black magician in the distance didn\u2019t react slowly. He turned to throw Death Mantra, Shadow Winding and Hell Flames at Qin Mo. The swordsman also used Light and Shadow Rotation and Qin Mo was jointly besieged by the two people. His blood fell to 50%.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng still didn\u2019t act.</p><br/><p>The domestic audience was dying. [Captain Ling is just watching the fun?] [Isn\u2019t he going to help his apprentice?] [Captain Ling, wake up! Can you play soy sauce in the World Competition?]</p><br/><p>No matter how anxious the audience became, Ling Xuefeng maintained his \u2018not blinking an eye at Mr. Tai collapsing\u2019 attitude. He stood calmly as a spectator while guiding his apprentice on the voice channel. \u201cPay attention to your position and find a way to kill them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Qin Mo knew his master was giving him a chance at 1v2 and his expression became serious, his eyes staring sharply at the dark screen. At this time, the black magician cast Dark Fear to cause Qin Mo to feel fear. The swordsman would also follow up with a control skill. Then Qin Mo would face the attacks of the two people and was likely to be beaten.</p><br/><p>Qin Mo no longer hesitated and used Combat Stealth, forcibly avoiding this wave of control. He quickly walked behind a big tree and used Blood Bat Festival!</p><br/><p>The angle of release for this skill was very clever and just covered both players of the French team.</p><br/><p>The vampire bats\u2019 big move caused the French team\u2019s swordsman and black magician to fall to 10% while Qin Mo sucked up blood and his blood returned to 70%.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng praised him. \u201cVery good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mo was so excited that his fingers were hot. In the World Competition, his master actually stood by and watched the battle, letting him face the opposite side. It could be said that his master was too bold or perhaps too trusting in Qin Mo?</p><br/><p>In any case, Master valued him and gave him this rare opportunity. Qin Mo was very moved and he was determined not to disappoint his master.</p><br/><p>Qin Mo grabbed his mouse and the blood kin summoner on the screen made a beautiful S-shaped displacement. He successfully escaped the swordsman\u2019s Breaking Bone Sword and called the blood kin knight, defeating the black magician with a wave of damage.</p><br/><p>These series of moves could really be called \u2018flowing water!\u2019</p><br/><p>A young player under 18 could do such a smooth operation in the World Competition, making the domestic audience full of confidence for the future of the Chinese Miracle League.</p><br/><p>[The little prince\u2019s positioning is 666, it is literally 6!] [Captain Ling is too much. Taking the World Competition as training?] [Captain Ling said, \u201cI will watch you quietly.\u201d] [The French players were in a residual blood state and Captain Ling said, \u201cI won\u2019t bother with two residual blood players!\u201d] [Captain Ling didn\u2019t act but he still crushed them in strength!]</p><br/><p>The audience watching the game praised Ling Xuefeng. Li Cangyu couldn\u2019t help smiling at the sight and said, \u201cXiao Qin played very well and could resist the pressure of 1v2.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han nodded seriously. \u201cYes, he\u2019s making great progress really very quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu hadn\u2019t heard his apprentice make a grammatical error in a while. He couldn\u2019t help touching Xiao Han\u2019s head and told him, \u201cIf there is a chance later, I will also take you to practice.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han\u2019s eyes brightened and he immediately nodded. \u201cYes! Master, I will go back and prepare!\u201d</p><br/><p>On the field, Ling Xuefeng still didn\u2019t act. Qin Mo had decreased the French players\u2019 blood to 10%. His blood snake and blood spider were on cooldown but he still had the knight. He relied on the protection of the knight and his flexible positioning to drag things on for half a minute until the cooldown of his blood snake ended.</p><br/><p>Qin Mo summoned the blood snake and had it bite the black magician, applying three layers of bleeding. Then he summoned the blood spider and set the swordsman Lemande in place!</p><br/><p>The bleeding state caused a large loss of blood and the black magician directly bled to death!</p><br/><p>Qin Mo followed with two ordinary attacks and took care of the bloody swordsman fixed in place.</p><br/><p>Double kill!</p><br/><p>Deafening screams and applause filled the venue. No one thought that the 18 year old summoner of the Chinese team could complete a double kill in the World Competition.</p><br/><p>The opponents might be in a residual blood state but Qin Mo could stabilize his mentality in a 1v2 situation. The connection of skills was smooth and the timing was just right. This type of strength was enough for the world Miracle fans to remember Qin Mo\u2019s name.</p><br/><p>Qin Mo was very excited. He released his mouse and looked at his master. \u201cMaster, I won!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng smiled as he stood up and patted Qin Mo\u2019s shoulder in encouragement. \u201cYou played well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng didn\u2019t shoot from beginning to end yet he and Qin Mo still won the game.</p><br/><p>This was the highest level of world-class players. He didn\u2019t need to act at all. His apprentice could easily abuse them!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

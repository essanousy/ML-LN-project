The members of the Australian team had to chase after them. If they didn\u2019t chase, it would be harder to play after the cooldown time.</p><br/><p>Everyone aimed at the black magician Yan Ruiwen, who was furthest away from the milk dad. The summoner Jamie released a banshee, wanting to pull Yan Ruiwen over. However, Yan Ruiwen had long been partnered up with the world\u2019s best demon summoner, Ling Xuefeng. How could it be that easy for him to be hit by a banshee\u2019s Charm?</p><br/><p>He jumped flexibly to the side and cleverly dodged the skill. The desperate James had to go close and used Breaking Bone Sword and Devouring Soul Sword to slash Yan Ruiwen into residual blood!</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan wanted to save him but Su Guangmo decisively said, \u201cNo, Vice-Captain Yan will wait for us at the upper blue resurrection point.\u201d</p><br/><p>His teammates understood this decision. After all, many of their skills were on cooldown. If Bai Xuan was caught by the control of the other side, the Chinese team\u2019s situation wouldn\u2019t be good. It was better to let Yan Ruiwen consume their big moves and then resurrect.</p><br/><p>Yan Ruiwen didn\u2019t mind the command to give up on rescuing him. Rather, he admired Su Guangmo\u2019s calmness and decisiveness.</p><br/><p>While being attacked by the four enemies, Yan Ruiwen showed the tenaciousness of the vice-captain of Wind Colour. He relied on moving around to consume many of the opponents\u2019 skills. Before he died, he used his final blue to cast a black magic curse. After a black magician died, they could use powerful black magic to hit their enemies.</p><br/><p>This was the legendary \u2018drag you with me when dying\u2019\u2026</p><br/><p>James was hit by this black magic curse and fell to residual blood. Xie Shurong was nearby and used Breaking Bone Sword to take away his head!</p><br/><p>The heads changed to 2:1.</p><br/><p>James looked at the grey screen and thought for a moment. \u201cWe will gather at the upper red resurrection point. The mechanisms in the corridor should transfer us to the upper floor. Jamie, try and step on one!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jamie went over and stepped on it. A bunch of arrows were fired from the wall, turning him into a hedgehog.</p><br/><p>James, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Why didn\u2019t the Chinese team play according to common sense?</p><br/><p>Why could the upper mechanisms transfer people while the lower floors fired a bunch of arrows?</p><br/><p>Jack was turned into a hedgehog and laughed. He was inexplicably beaten to 10% of his blood and frightened to death by the arrows that suddenly fired. It seemed that the mechanism in the Mechanical City couldn\u2019t be casually touched!</p><br/><p>\u201cGather in the middle of the stairs!\u201d James was forced to have everyone change their route.</p><br/><p>At this time, the four Chinese players came up to the upper level.</p><br/><p>The berserker Bruno was the first to die and he had just resurrected. He took the axe to the centre of the stairs to protect his other three teammates. Yu Pingsheng also walked in front to protect the other players. The two sides gathered at the red and blue resurrection points.</p><br/><p>The five second cooldown soon ended. Yan Ruiwen and James were resurrected one after another. The other players also recovered their blood and blue at the resurrection point. The five people gathered together.</p><br/><p>This time the group battle was in the middle of the upper corridor. It wasn\u2019t the deliberate choice of both sides but they happened to meet here.</p><br/><p>As a melee in the front row, Yu Pingsheng didn\u2019t hesitate to use Mountain Chop the moment he saw the other side.</p><br/><p>The big axe directly stunned the berserker Bruno in the front row!</p><br/><p>They were both berserkers but Yu Pingsheng\u2019s reaction speed was much faster than Bruno. Even so, the Australian players weren\u2019t discouraged at all. After all, they had four outputs and the control skills of the two demon summoners.</p><br/><p>Jamie immediately called his banshee and used the big move\u2014Witch Demon\u2019s Curse!</p><br/><p>The big move finally hit!</p><br/><p>After several consecutive control skills missed, he felt a bit relieved for one to finally hit\u2026</p><br/><p>Then he wanted to cry in his heart.</p><br/><p>The Witch Demon\u2019s Curse happened to bring MOMO, YUYU and XIEXIE to the front row of the Australian team!</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong really wanted to thank the summoner at this time. Pulling with the banshee saved him from running forward. Su Guangmo and Yu Pingsheng also had the same mind. After being pulled over, Su Yu joined hands to open the group attack\u2014Light and Shadow Rotation and World Without Justice!</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo\u2019s Light and Shadow Rotation covered the area with a white light and the bloody demon summoner and white magician started to fall down.</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng\u2019s big move \u2018World Without Justice\u2019 was one where the axe in his hand swept 360 degrees. The golden light and shadow instantly covered the top of their heads!</p><br/><p>The power of Su Yu\u2019s joint outbreak was quite shocking. Meanwhile, Xie Shurong controlled the white magician in the back who was trying to cast a skill.</p><br/><p>The understanding between the two people was high. The two older brothers joined forces to attack while the younger brother was responsible for interrupting and controlling. Australia\u2019s back row was beaten and they had no way to read the skills.</p><br/><p>The resurrected Yan Ruiwen also used a black magic spell, Hell Flames!</p><br/><p>Black flames appeared under their feet. The Australian team stood in the middle of the move and only had 30% residual blood left!</p><br/><p>James was desperately trying to use big moves on the Chinese team but due to the existence of Bai Xuan, everyone\u2019s blood volume actually remained above 80%.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan added blood in an orderly manner. The healing buff, Healing Language was constantly applied to his teammates. Whoever lost health would receive a single target healing skill. If the group lost blood then he would open a healing array. This milk dad seemed to have no sense of existence but in the chaos of combat, he moved around and took care of the blood of all his teammates.</p><br/><p>James was astonished. This blood-adding technique didn\u2019t lose to the US team\u2019s vice-captain, Winfrey?</p><br/><p>Winfrey was a famous name in the world\u2019s Miracle Circle and she had fans all over the world. She was called a world-class god milk but he had never heard of the player called White Fox before.</p><br/><p>As if responding to James\u2019 doubts, Bai Xuan immediately released a healing chain\u2014Holy Star!</p><br/><p>The white light chain flashed to the side and front with the priest as the centre. It managed to add blood to the distant Xie Shurong and Su Guangmo, restoring their original 80% blood to full blood.</p><br/><p>James, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He could actually predict this teammate\u2019s position to increase blood. This dad was too good!</p><br/><p>Australia had five outputs while the Chinese team only had four. The Australian team should be dominant in terms of output. However, reality was the opposite. The two demon summoners were repeatedly interrupted and couldn\u2019t use their skills!</p><br/><p>James was going crazy. Once the team battle actually started, he discovered that the Australian team\u2019s fierce attacks were being covered by the milk dad on the other side. The front row defense had been charged through since the beginning. The rear white magician\u2019s skills couldn\u2019t be cast. The remaining summoners were also being beaten!</p><br/><p>This map was a pit and the game was too hard!</p><br/><p>James had never felt so tired. It had been simple to play in Australia. Why did he feel his brain wasn\u2019t enough to fight the Chinese team?</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Australia was completely defeated in this wave and the five people destroyed!</p><br/><p>The Australian team tried their best to kill Yan Ruiwen and take another head. In the end, the Su, Yu and Shu trio joined forces and quickly cut into their back row, killing both summoners and the white magician.</p><br/><p>10:2!</p><br/><p>The Chinese team took the lead in getting 10 heads and won death racing!</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong dropped the keyboard with excitement and directly hugged Bai Xuan next to him. \u201cYou really give me strength! Playing with you here is just like a team battle!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan wasn\u2019t comfortable but Ah Shu\u2019s embrace wasn\u2019t particularly tight and had a warm sensation.</p><br/><p>In any case, it was a winning celebration and Bai Xuan didn\u2019t think too much. He smiled and said, \u201cYou are also very powerful. You killed three people in this game.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong laughed and said, \u201cOf course, how can your boyfriend not be good? I\u2019m amazing in every way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan\u2019s face turned red. \u201c\u2026Shut up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Next, Su Guangmo stood up and smiled at the teammates around him. \u201cEveryone has worked hard and won all three games. We lived up to this pitted map!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng thought for a long time before nodding. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo looked at his appearance which was different from the berserker on the field. He couldn\u2019t help hugging his little brother. \u201cThe opening is very good. It is worthy of our Yu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng thought about it and said, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo smiled and touched his head. \u201cYou still aren\u2019t talking. Look at you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng didn\u2019t speak and silently followed behind his brothers.</p><br/><p>The five players emerged from the soundproof room and received warm applause from the others. Tan Shitian, Li Cangyu and the others stood up and clapped to celebrate them winning the third game.</p><br/><p>This game was really smooth. It was the first match of the World Competition and they even won all three games. It was the perfect opening for the Chinese team!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

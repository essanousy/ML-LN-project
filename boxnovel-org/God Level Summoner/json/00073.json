Xiao Gu wanted to go to the legendary biggest Miracle store in the world. Xiao Han didn\u2019t express an opinion but once the surrounding stores were mentioned, his eyes turned bright. Li Cangyu decided to take everyone to the stores.</p><br/><p>The World Carnival attracted Miracle fans from all over the world. Once Li Cangyu arrived at the shopping centre, he found that there were crowds of people here, with some well-known shops having long queues.</p><br/><p>The third floor contained the largest Miracle Square, with six racial status with realistic appearance at the entrance. These status were over two metres tall and many tourists stood with the statue to take a group photo.</p><br/><p>Gu Siming tugged Xiao Han and rushed into the surrounding stores. He faced a large row of game models in the window and finally decided to buy a model of a paladin. He was just about to pay when Zhang Jueming patted the back of his head. \u201cYou are stupid. Coming all the way to buy this stuff when the domestic Taobao stores have it at almost the same price and even do home deliveries!\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Siming, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan also came over and smiled at Xiao Gu. \u201cYour Uncle Zhang is right. These globally distributed models don\u2019t need to be bought in New York. Their prices are unified and they can be bought domestically. If you want to buy something, you might as well buy the limited editions that aren\u2019t available in China.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Siming suddenly realized. \u201cOh, that\u2019s right!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan had a collecting hobby. His eyes quickly locked on a glass counter and he walked Xiao Gu over to it, pointing to a display of exquisite goods. \u201cThese are all limited editions.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Siming wanted to take the entire glass counter back with him. Unfortunately, the limited editions goods were expensive. He brought a lot of money but he could only buy a few pieces. What should he buy? Gu Siming lowered his head and carefully selected.</p><br/><p>Xiao Han also walked to the limited edition area and his eyes lingered on a box of bookmarks. Bai Xuan walked over to him and smiled. \u201cThis set of bookmarks is to commemorate the sixth season, including all the current classes in Miracle. The metal is well preserved and it won\u2019t fade for several years.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han nodded at Vice-Captain Bai\u2019s comments. \u201cThe physical bookmarks are better than the online photos.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to buy it?\u201d Bai Xuan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Xiao Han looked at the price. This set of bookmarks was particularly expensive and he didn\u2019t have that much money on him. Buying the limited edition items was too extravagant. Perhaps he could buy a set of paper as commemoration. Xiao Han thought this and looked up. \u201cI won\u2019t buy it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he reluctant removed his gaze to other areas.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan looked at the teenager\u2019s upright back and smiled slightly. Li Cangyu was coming this way so Bai Xuan immediately pulled him to a corner and said softly, \u201cXiao Han obviously doesn\u2019t have much money when he came to New York this time. He just looked at a limited edition bookmarks set and wasn\u2019t willing to buy it. Do you want to buy it for him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, there is little meaning.\u201d Li Cangyu used his credit card and bought the bookmarks set that Xiao Han was just looking at. Then he walked to the teenager and patted him on the shoulder, saying, \u201cXiao Han, this is for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han turned and found that Li Cangyu was holding the item he had been paying attention to for a long time but wasn\u2019t willing to buy. He felt touched but protested, \u201cI\u2026 I can\u2019t accept you gift\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo polite.\u201d Li Cangyu laughed. \u201cIt is a good thing to accept. I am older than you and have earned more money than you. If you don\u2019t mind, it is better to become my apprentice.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Gu\u2019s ears were very sharp. When he heard this, he rushed over and said, \u201cQuickly agree! Cat God has never taken an apprentice before! If Cheng Wei knows this then he will definitely be jealous to death, hahaha. You can be out team\u2019s little prince! You will be on par with Qin Mo!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Who was Cheng Wei? Who was Qin Mo? He could never understand the little madman\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu saw Xiao Han\u2019s stunned expression. He patted the boy on his shoulder and said, \u201cI want to accept you as an apprentice because you are very talented. If you really want to be good at playing Miracle, you can follow me. I have played in competitions for many years and my experience is richer than yours.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cat God was actually being humble because his level could already be considered world-class. Xiao Han was a rookie without professional training. The most powerful proof was that he was killed down to his underwear in the online game.</p><br/><p>Xiao Han didn\u2019t know how strong this person was. He only knew that the other person was a \u2018professional player\u2019. He didn\u2019t know much about the domestic Miracle League and never heard the name of Cat God.</p><br/><p>However, Li Cangyu\u2019s sincerity moved the teenager.</p><br/><p>He was just a small and inconspicuous player. Forget Cat God putting him into his fixed team in the online game. Cat God personally ran to Boston to see him and today he bought such a valuable item and wanted to accept him as an apprentice\u2026</p><br/><p>This treatment made Xiao Han feel flattered and particularly warm.</p><br/><p>He looked at Li Cangyu in front of him and found that this man\u2019s smile was really handsome!</p><br/><p>How could he hesitate to recognize such a master?</p><br/><p>Xiao Han thought this and immediately nodded. \u201cOkay, I will acknowledge you as my master!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled with satisfaction. \u201cGood, I promise that you won\u2019t regret it.\u201d</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t planned to accept Xiao Han as an apprentice. Then he talked to Ling Xuefeng on the street last night and Ling Xuefeng mentioned that it was rare for a killer to surpass the Lou Zhang combination in the domestic Miracle League. Xiao Han had been abroad and wasn\u2019t affected by the style of killers in the domestic league. He was a piece of white paper and how he grew in the future depended entirely on him.</p><br/><p>If Li Cangyu could one day bring this mixed-race boy back to China, maybe he really could become the most distinctive killer on the stage of the Chinese Miracle League?</p><br/><p>Besides, Ling Xuefeng had Qin Mo as an apprentice so Li Cangyu couldn\u2019t fall behind.</p><br/><p>He looked at the young boy who felt lost after having no money to buy the surrounding goods and softened. This Xiao Han might\u2019ve experienced some things, leading to a more rebellious and arrogant nature than the average teenager. Li Cangyu wanted to raise this boy and his strong desire to protect this boy made him not hesitate. He decided to accept Xiao Han as an apprentice.</p><br/><p>At this point, the teenager\u2019s black eyes were full of emotions. Li Cangyu\u2019s smile couldn\u2019t become wider as he patted the young boy\u2019s head and stuffed the bookmarks set into his hand. He said, \u201cThis is Master\u2019s gift to you. I want to buy you something so you don\u2019t have to be polite. Just accept it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Xiao Han was happy enough to faint.</p><br/><p>It felt good to be fostered by a local tyrant!</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu opened the buying mode of a \u2018local tyrant\u2019. He bought many goods for Xiao Han and Xiao Gu, making the two youngsters extremely happy.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu didn\u2019t expect that he would actually encounter Ling Xuefeng in these stores.</p><br/><p>The eyes of the two men met in the crowd. Ling Xuefeng immediately walked over and said, \u201cWhat a coincidence. Why are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m bringing my friends to buy something. What are you doing here?\u201d Li Cangyu looked at him doubtfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was idle today and decided to help Qin Mo buy something for Yan Ruiwen.\u201d Ling Xuefeng glanced behind him and say Bai Xuan and Zhang Jueming. He took the initiative to greet them first. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan came forward with a smile. \u201cCaptain Ling is well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming exclaimed, \u201cThis is Ling Xuefeng? I haven\u2019t seen you in so long. You\u2019ve changed a lot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng said, \u201cYou have also changed a lot, Old Zhang.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming laughed and touched his chin. \u201cI have a beard. I\u2019m getting old!\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Siming heard Captain Ling\u2019s name and immediately ran over. \u201cCaptain Ling!\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, he didn\u2019t dare to directly pounce on this man. After all, Captain Ling was too serious and showed an indifferent expression to everyone apart from Cat God.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng looked at the baby-faced boy in front of him and immediately thought of the paladin in Cat\u2019s team\u2026 his own black fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you Xiao Gu?\u201d Ling Xuefeng nodded to him.</p><br/><p>Gu Siming was excited. \u201cAh, I didn\u2019t expect Captain Ling to know my last name! Hehe! I am Gu Siming!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming rubbed his head. \u201cHurry and ask Captain Ling for a signature.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, yes!\u201d Gu Siming opened a packet of freshly bought posters and handed one to Ling Xuefeng. \u201cCaptain Ling, can I get a signature?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng was polite and signed \u2018Undead Demon\u2019. This was his registered ID in the Miracle Professional League and he was called a devil by fans. Gu Siming was very excited and cautiously put away the signed poster.</p><br/><p>Xiao Han didn\u2019t know who Ling Xuefeng was but after seeing everyone come over to say hello, he came and stood behind Cat God.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng saw this blond, black-eyed mixed-race youth and couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cWho is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu replied, \u201cThe assassin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng suddenly realized. \u201cOh, Frost Descends?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han\u2019s eyes widened with surprise. \u201cHow do you know my game ID?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Steamed Bass and I previously fought with you in the new district.\u201d Ling Xuefeng said.</p><br/><p>Xiao Han couldn\u2019t help thinking, \u2018This is the one Cat God called the weakest among his friends?\u2019</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu took the initiative to say, \u201cHis name is Xiao Han and I just accepted him as an apprentice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that right?\u201d Ling Xuefeng looked at Xiao Han and found that this young boy looked very cold and stubborn. He seemed a bit like Ling Xuefeng\u2019s arrogant apprentice Qin Mo. However, Ling Xuefeng believed that this little guy would become obedient after a week of training with Li Cangyu.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng thought up to here and said, \u201cTrain him well and I will let him play with Qin Mo later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu laughed. \u201cThat is what I intended.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han was very confused when he heard the name Qin Mo but refused to ask. Gu Siming actively came over and explained, \u201cQin Mo is a rookie in the domestic Miracle League and Captain Ling\u2019s only apprentice. Captain Ling is our Cat God\u2019s strongest opponent so you and Qin Mo will definitely be opponents in the future!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han was very dazed. Didn\u2019t his master say that this person was the weakest among all his friends? How come he was the strongest opponent?</p><br/><p>Gu Siming gently patted Xiao Han\u2019s shoulder and said in the tone of a senior, \u201cYoung man, you have to refuel!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Xiao Han darkly glared at him. \u201cGu Siming, aren\u2019t you a few months younger than me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Gu Siming pretended not to know.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Xiao Han ignored him while his heart was full of curiosity about China\u2019s Miracle League.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have to go first.\u201d Ling Xuefeng looked down at his watch and said. \u201cThe official delegation of Chinese reporters will be here soon to film the stores. In order to avoid being recognized, I suggest that you get out of here as soon as possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go after buying something.\u201d Li Cangyu replied. \u201cGo first and have a good afternoon rest. The Carnival will open tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, I understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng turned away. Li Cangyu moved through the stores with his teammates before also leaving.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>On the afternoon of the same day, Li Cangyu took everyone to visit a few well-known attractions around the city. They also ate authentic Western food.</p><br/><p>It was already dark when they came home and they had to get up early to go to the Carnival venue tomorrow. Li Cangyu suggested that everyone go to bed early.</p><br/><p>Xiao Han had a shower and sat on his bed to sort through today\u2019s harvest. Then he heard a knock on the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome in.\u201d Xiao Han put away the surrounding boxes and Li Cangyu opened the door. Xiao Han quickly got up. \u201cMaster.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Han, sit down. I have something to say to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu walked over and sat down next to him. After the shower, the teenager\u2019s skin appeared whiter and his golden hair fell softly over his ears. He looked very cute but always had a cold expression, making Li Cangyu think of a beautiful Persian cat with noble blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, did something happen?\u201d Xiao Han asked as he looked up.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled and stared at him earnestly. \u201cXiao Han, I used to be a professional player and I plan to return to the Miracle League next year. If you are interested in playing the professional league, I can bring you back to China. Our team belongs to the well-known Dragon Warriors Club in China. The accommodations, training and eating conditions are all good. The players are also easy to get along with. You will certainly adapt if you live there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu added, \u201cOf course, if you don\u2019t want to then I won\u2019t force you. After all, you are young and playing in the league isn\u2019t as casual as the online game. You have to think carefully.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han was stunned. \u201cAt my level, can I really play in the professional league?\u201d</p><br/><p>He played an assassin in the game because he liked hiding in the darkness to kill people. Xiao Han didn\u2019t feel that he had the ability to compete with professional players. The proof was when he fought with Xie Shurong who was a god.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt your current level, you can\u2019t enter the league.\u201d Li Cangyu patted his apprentice on the shoulder and continued, \u201cBut you have many advantages. As long as you receive professional training, you level can definitely improve. I am interested in your great potential.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu looked at the teenager. \u201cXiao Han, I will ask you a serious question. Are you interested in the Miracle Professional League?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course! I always wanted to play but many clubs in the United States aren\u2019t openly recruiting.\u201d Xiao Han made tight fists as he said this. If he wasn\u2019t interested in the professional league, he wouldn\u2019t pay attention to this side of Miracle or have the Chinese player Tree as his idol. Just\u2026 Xiao Han scratched his head with hesitation. \u201cMy father might not agree.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu said, \u201cAs long as you have a firm attitude, do you want me to help convince your father?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han\u2019s eyes suddenly lit up. \u201cGreat!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled and rubbed his apprentice\u2019s head. \u201cDon\u2019t rush to make a decision. Playing in the league isn\u2019t a simple matter. Once you become a professional player, you must undergo harsh and cruel training. You must also bear failure and embarrassment. I\u2019ll give you a week to think about it and then let me know your decision. You are young and have to think responsibly before making a decision. You can\u2019t be impulsive, understood?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d Xiao Han nodded.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was only a few years older than him but this man\u2019s experience made him seem calm. Every sentence was very reasonable. Even if Xiao Han was in his rebellious period, he admired and respected his newly recognized master.</p><br/><p>Master was right. He couldn\u2019t make a hasty decision. He would soon be 18 years old and must be responsible for his future. Xiao Han decided to calm down and think about whether he truly wanted to become a professional player.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

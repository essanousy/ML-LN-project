If they one day became battle cards in the Star Card Master game, what type of skills will they have.</p><br/><p>Thus, a number of character gods were designed.</p><br/><p>The first is naturally the biggest winner of the male gods series, Liu Chuan.</p><br/><p>In the beginning, he led the Dragon Song team to win the championship and created the Dragon Song e-sports club. After signing Li Cangyu, Cat God led the team to fight the great gods in the professional league. After winning the domestic championship, they also won the world championship. As a result, Cat God\u2019s apprentice and Qin Mo emerged and signed to the Dragon Song Club.</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan smiled and said: It doesn\u2019t matter what you do, the championship belongs to my club.</p><br/><p>Everyone: Get out of here!</p><br/><p>[Liu Chuan</p><br/><p>Card Level: 70</p><br/><p>Evolution Star: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</p><br/><p>Skill 1: Taunt with your face (Liu Chuan smiles and taunts all hostile targets in range to attack himself).</p><br/><p>Skill 2: Invincible mouth (Liu Chuan enters a rapid fire mouth gun mode, attacking enemy players in range and causing 300% sonic damage to the targets).</p><br/><p>Skill 3: The ultimate winner (Liu takes out the championship trophies of the three teams Dragon Song, Canglan and Mojue. The golden light of the trophies illuminates the whole game, improving the combat power of allies by 200% and increasing the hatred of all enemy forces by 500%).</p><br/><p>After the card production was finished, Liu Chuan was very confused. \u201cI like the ultimate winner skill but why does it increase the enemy\u2019s hatred?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone else, \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan spoke innocently, \u201cPerhaps my Dragon Song Club is a treasure land of feng shui. Every team that enters or club are champions. Ah, we won too many prizes and there is almost no place left to leave the trophies.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone, \u201c\u2026Join forces to destroy him!\u201d]</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan came out so there naturally needs to be his CP, Wu Zewen.</p><br/><p>[Wu Zewen</p><br/><p>Card Level: 70</p><br/><p>Evolution Star: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</p><br/><p>Skill 1: School tyrant\u2019s database (automatically analyze all card data on the field and generate the best attack scenario).</p><br/><p>Skill 2: Map expert (if the field map is complex, Wu Zewen can automatically find the best attack location).</p><br/><p>Skill 3: Pets with 10,000 poisons (summons snakes, spiders and other poisonous pets to cause 300% group damage to targets within range).</p><br/><p>Wu Zewen pushed up his glasses and said, \u201cIf you need me to design a 3D labyrinth for the game, you can ask me to work part-time.\u201d</p><br/><p>The school tyrant would never refuse part-time work to make money.]</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Next is the protagonist of God Level Summoner, LI Cangyu.</p><br/><p>Cat God is an upright Cat God. He isn\u2019t as shameless as Liu Chuan and wasn\u2019t contaminated by the shameless toxins of the Dragon Song Club. After experiencing a downturn in the Wulin period, Cat God returned to Miracle to stop the gods. He used the protagonist mode to go all the world to the World Competition, winning it.</p><br/><p>The upright Cat God has card skills that are slightly less upright.</p><br/><p>[Li Cangyu</p><br/><p>Card Level: 70</p><br/><p>Evolution Star: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</p><br/><p>Skill 1: Loves to eat fish (if there are fish on the field, Li Cangyu\u2019s basic combat power will increase by 300% after eating fish).</p><br/><p>Skill 2: National team captain (Li Cangyu has an impact on all cards from the Miracle Professional League and will absorb 10% of the attack power of the Miracle League\u2019s national team character cards.)</p><br/><p>Skill 3: Cataclysm (Summons the water, fire, wind and thunder spirits and instantly explode them, inflicting 300% group damage to all targets in range).</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled. \u201cThe skill of eating fish is designed very well. If you feed me more fish, my combat effectiveness can double again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng, \u201cOf course, I have to feed you.\u201d]</p><br/><p>[Ling Xuefeng</p><br/><p>Card Level: 70</p><br/><p>Evolution Star: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</p><br/><p>Skill 1: Fish expert (Can make steamed bass, braised fish, squirrel mandarin fish, west lake vinegar fish and other fish dishes.

The two sides were equal at 1:1. The onlookers might be joking about both captains but the fans of the two teams were extremely tense. The third game was crucial. Whoever won the third game would take the lead and match point.</p><br/><p>According to the rules of the home and away rotation, the third game would be Wind Colour\u2019s home and Ling Xuefeng would decide the game mode and map. This was naturally very beneficial for the Wind Colour team.</p><br/><p>In the soundproof room, Li Cangyu summoned the players together and spoke quickly. \u201cIn the team battle just now, Ling Xuefeng used the 3, 2, 1 split mode to build more advantages in the early stage. The next game at home, he has a high probability of choosing a team battle. Our lineup is unchanged. Xiao Zhuo and Xiao Gu needs to be extra careful. Even if you miss a few mobs, you have to pay attention to the positioning of the enemy and don\u2019t be caught by them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang and Gu Siming immediately nodded seriously.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu continued saying, \u201cIn the first wave against the ice dragon, Xiao Zhuo and I will use Flying Feather Steps to set up a trap. Once the people of Wind Colour arrive, we will set fire to kill whoever steps into the trap first. The task of controlling the sacrifice will be handed over to Old Zhang and Ah Shu will disturb their distance casting.</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming and Xie Shurong immediately exclaimed, \u201cUnderstood!\u201d</p><br/><p>Vice-Captain Bai Xuan suddenly reminded softly, \u201cThe probability of Wind Colour choosing a team battle at home is very high but you should remember that you guess wrong every time you encounter Ling Xuefeng\u2026 is it possible he will choose the arena?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan was right. Wind Colour\u2019s tactics in the second game were quite beautiful but Ling Xuefeng might not necessarily choose a team battle. The possibility of the arena had to also be considered.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu kept this in mind and said, \u201cIf Ling Xuefeng chooses the arena then we will play according to the arrangement already decided. The partners that will cooperate with each other\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The intermission time soon ended and the captains of both sides sat in the command position again.</p><br/><p>\u201cAudience members, welcome back to the finals of the seventh season! In the previous two games, Canglan and Wind Colour\u2019s score is equal. The third game is Wind Colour\u2019s home game. Let us see how Captain Ling will choose!\u201d Kou Hongyi quickly explained in an excited manner. Yu Bing sat calmly next to him, eyes fixed on the big screen.</p><br/><p>Finally, Ling Xuefeng\u2019s submitted choices popped up on the big screen.</p><br/><p>The third game was the arena, the map was the Space-Time Tunnel!</p><br/><p>There was an uproar in the audience and many Canglan fans didn\u2019t look good. It was because Space-Time Tunnel was a super difficult seven star map. It wasn\u2019t a death map or a status map, it was a large maze!</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei immediately spat out, \u201cWhy is Captain Ling choosing such difficult maps today? In addition, he didn\u2019t choose a team battle?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian responded politely to Cheng Wei\u2019s question. He heard this and softly explained, \u201cCaptain Ling has continuously commanded two team battles. This is very energy intensive. He might choose the arena to adjust his status. Wind Colour isn\u2019t bad in the arena and there is the home game advantage. Their chance of winning is still very big.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei couldn\u2019t help blushing and suddenly felt that he was a lot stupider than Tan Shitian.</p><br/><p>The moment Su Guangmo saw this map, he couldn\u2019t help getting a headache. It was because it evoked unpleasant memories. The Flying Feathers team had been smashed on this Space-Time Tunnel map, which wasn\u2019t good for melee classes.</p><br/><p>The always silent Yu Pingsheng suddenly grabbed his brother\u2019s arm and whispered, \u201cCanglan is in danger.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo looked over at him and smile. \u201cYes.\u201d The players of Wind Colour are very good in the labyrinth. Previously, Wind Colour have never lost an arena game when playing with this Space-Time Tunnel map. They haven\u2019t uses this trump card map in this season and finally selected it today. It seems that Ling Xuefeng is bound to win this game.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng nodded seriously and moved his eyes to the big screen.</p><br/><p>After submitting the game mode and map, Ling Xuefeng followed up by submitting the lineup\u2014Qin Mo and He Qun.</p><br/><p>This combination had appeared in the regular season. Qin Mo\u2019s explosive power was very impressive while He Qun could protect Qin Mo and counter the opponents. Both of them were blood kin players who could absorb the opponent\u2019s blood while attacking. They could go invisible and were the super blood cow combination of the Wind Colour team.</p><br/><p>The away team could choose the map but they could some people to target the home team\u2019s lineup. After seeing that Ling Xuefeng sent the Qin Mo and He Qun blood cow combination, Li Cangyu sat at the command post and thought for a moment. Then he submitted the first lineup, Xiao Han and Zhuo Hang.</p><br/><p>The audience cheered on the live broadcast. [The small prince is on again!] [This is a bit like the regular season but Xiao Han isn\u2019t with Old Zhang?] [Cat God let Xiao Han and Zhuo Hang appear. He should be wanting to play fast.]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu\u2019s idea was obvious. Hit quickly.</p><br/><p>The two blood kin players were capable of delaying the battle and it would take time to move around the labyrinth map. If Canglan didn\u2019t send fast attackers then time would drag out and it would be more disadvantageous.</p><br/><p>After submitting the list of people, Li Cangyu left the command post and walked back to the seats. He whispered to Zhuo Hang and Xiao Han, \u201cThe opposite side\u2019s blood kin will be invisible. Xiao Zhuo will act as protection while Xiao Han will be the main output. Think of a method to control the sacrifice and kill Qin Mo.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two people understood. They bumped fists to cheer each other on and walked towards the player seats.</p><br/><p>On the Wind Colour side, Qin Mo and He Qun were also ready. The referee lit up the indicator lights and the third game officially begun!</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The Space-Time map was very colourful. There were various bands of light flowing through the tunnel, with one colour a winding road. This was a great test for the players. Colour blind players and direction challenged players would completely lose their way.</p><br/><p>There was a road at both ends of the tunnel that led to a central area and the terrain of the central area was particularly complicated. The winding roads had four directions to the east, south, north and west. Each direction branched into small channels that connected to each other. If the opponent was interested in playing hide and seek, it wouldn\u2019t be easy to find them.</p><br/><p>Qin Mo and He Qun were invisible from the beginning. Xiao Han\u2019s blood kin assassin was only invisible. Zhuo Hang didn\u2019t have any stealth skills but he had Flying Feather Steps!</p><br/><p>At the beginning of the game, Zhuo Hang immediately flew forward with Flying Feather Steps. He reached the central area at the fastest speed and then placed the lowest-level setting traps at the forks in the four directions.</p><br/><p>The damage caused by the setting traps were very small and the effect only lasted one second. The advantage was its short cooldown time and that the amount of blue consumed was very low.</p><br/><p>As the preliminary trap for hunters, Zhuo Hang generally only used it to limit enemies in special terrain.</p><br/><p>Space-Time Tunnel was the ace map of the Wind Colour team. Li Cangyu would\u2019ve certainly had everyone train in it. Zhuo Hang was very familiar with the terrain here. After the low-level traps were arranged, he immediately retreated to the junction of two channels and waited for Xiao Han to come.</p><br/><p>The blood kin players moved slower than elves. Xiao Han only arrived at this time. He Qun and Qin Mo also came over. The audience held their breaths because the two people of Wind Colour were about to arrive at a fork and Zhuo Hang\u2019s traps were waiting for them!</p><br/><p>To everyone\u2019s surprise, Qin Mo arrived at a trap but didn\u2019t go straight. He summoned his blood snake to explore the road. The small prince\u2019s awareness wasn\u2019t bad. He knew the other side had a hunter and didn\u2019t go himself, letting his pets step into the trap!</p><br/><p>The blood snake moved forward and sure enough, it was set in place.</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang\u2019s trap was successfully broken and the setting effect wasn\u2019t applied, but at least he and Xiao Han knew that Qin Mo had come!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou hide first. I will drop the trap and blow them up before you start.\u201d Zhuo Hang ordered.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, be careful.\u201d Xiao Han spoke while turning the camera and staring sharply at the southeast where Wind Colour were located.</p><br/><p>The audience saw that after revealing the trap, the invisible Qin Mo let his blood snake move to the other side of the road which happened to be the direction of the hidden Xiao Han.</p><br/><p>The shocking thing was that both sides were in stealth yet Xiao Han suddenly used a backstab!</p><br/><p>He hit behind him and once the skill finished, Qin Mo appeared.</p><br/><p>Qin Mo was surprised and obviously hadn\u2019t expected Xiao Han to pop up.</p><br/><p>Kou Hongyi and Yu Bing were silent because neither of them could explain Xiao Han\u2019s magical intuition\u2014or was it not intuition?</p><br/><p>Only Li Cangyu knew that this was due to the complexity of the Space-Time Tunnel. During training, he had Zhuo Hang and Xiao Han practice together. Zhuo Hang went east, Xiao Han went west, Zhuo Hang went south, Xiao Han went north.</p><br/><p>At present, only the trap in the east had been destroyed by Qin Mo\u2019s blood snake. Qin Mo would definitely advance from the east and Zhuo Hang played a trap in the fork at the east. Since Qin Mo wasn\u2019t caught by Zhuo Hang\u2019s trap, he could only be coming from the north direction.</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang\u2019s traps weren\u2019t just for capturing people. He could also assist Xiao Han in making a judgment about the opponent\u2019s position!</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>On the second floor, Chairman Nan Jiangang of the Miracle Professional League saw this scene and couldn\u2019t help smiling. \u201cXiao Han\u2019s reaction surprised me. That child\u2019s growth rate is really too fast. Zhuo Hang\u2019s awareness is also good. He used the combination of traps and terrain to help his teammate judge the position. The two little ones know each other very well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. Look at the club they are in.\u201d The man wearing sunglasses and smiling was Liu Chuan, the owner of the Dragon Song Club. He came to watch the match today but he was also a member of the E-Sports Association.</p><br/><p>Nan Jiangang glanced over at him and asked, \u201cGod Chuan is very confident in them? Do you think Canglan can win this game?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan grinned. \u201cLi Cangyu\u2019s standards are absolutely first class and he is well aware of the Wind Colour team. Li Cangyu would have Canglan go through special training for this map and this game shouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>The colleague sitting next to him whispered, \u201cCan\u2019t you be less boastful?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan made an innocent expression. \u201cI\u2019m just being honest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact, the people of the China E-Sports Association were watching the finals of Wind Colour VS Canglan but they were also preparing for the formation of the national team.</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan was an executive director of the E-Sports Association. He used to be an e-sports god. Compared to the so called leadership who didn\u2019t understand e-sports, Nan Jiangang preferred this person. He was experienced and at least understood the game.</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan coming here was due to Chairman Nan Jiangang\u2019s proposal. Liu Chuan was naturally willing to see Cat God\u2019s performance.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>In the game, Xiao Han\u2019s sudden attack made Qin Mo passively appear. Qin Mo was shocked for a moment but he quickly reacted. He used the blood spider to set Xiao Han in place but Xiao Han responded quickly and used Pain Blade!</p><br/><p>This was the assassin\u2019s stun skill and the control time was slightly longer.</p><br/><p>Qin Mo was dizzy and couldn\u2019t release any skills. Xiao Han was fixed by the blood spider and lost blood but he could still attack.</p><br/><p>He ignored his blood loss and quickly aimed a series of big moves towards Qin Mo.</p><br/><p>\u2014Fatal Blow! Soul Stab! Death Strangulation!</p><br/><p>The blood kin assassin\u2019s dagger moved in the direction, creating a series of handsome light effects. Qin Mo\u2019s blood plummeted. The blood spider\u2019s attacks could give him blood but the amount of blood recovered wasn\u2019t enough when compared to Xiao Han\u2019s damage!</p><br/><p>The three seconds stun effect ended and the awakened Qin Mo immediately used Blood Bat Festival!</p><br/><p>However, Xiao Han suddenly disappeared in front of him.</p><br/><p>He used Combat Stealth!</p><br/><p>The use of this Combat Stealth was too clever and allowed him to dodge Qin Mo\u2019s big move. Qin Mo wanted to cough up blood. The thing that made him depressed was that He Qun was late.</p><br/><p>The direction cut the camera to the southeast road where He Qun was caught in Zhuo Hang\u2019s traps. Zhuo Hang madly pressed the keyboard to set off one trap after another. He Qun suffered from the wave of trap explosions.</p><br/><p>Under the stage, Bai Xuan couldn\u2019t help sighing, \u201cXiao Zhuo\u2019s style of play is really becoming smarter. He actually learnt to use the terrain of the maze to lay a chain trap to kill his opponent\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang whispered, \u201cI, I have seen him. He has been training in Space-Time Tunnel, sometimes until late at night.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan heard this and couldn\u2019t help smiling at Li Xiaojiang. \u201cI know Xiaojiang. Are you helping Zhuo Hang speak?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang blushed and stammered, \u201cHe, he is very serious.</p><br/><p>They were roommates so Li Xiaojiang had seen Zhuo Hang frequently practice and improve. In the beginning, Li Xiaojiang felt that the arrogant Zhuo Hang was too hard to get along with. Then after the two of them became familiar with each other, Li Xiaojiang discovered that Zhuo Hang didn\u2019t have a bad nature, he was just somewhat proud.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu listened to Bai Xuan and Li Xiaojiang\u2019s conversation and didn\u2019t express his opinion. He knew that Zhuo Hang\u2019s progress had been largely influenced by Xiaojiang. The fact that they absorbed each other\u2019s advantages to help themselves improve was consistent with Li Cangyu\u2019s original expectations.</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang and Xiao Han were both talented players. The fast attack combination was better than Li Cangyu expected.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>On the field, Qin Mo was suppressed by Xiao Han and He Qun lost a lot of blood from Zhuo Hang\u2019s serial traps. The two of them finally met in one place and He Qun was forced to open a big move to return blood. The blood volume of both sides didn\u2019t seem much different but the Wind Colour members knew that they suffered a great loss in the first wave.</p><br/><p>Qin Mo\u2019s big move had missed while Zhuo Hang only used small skills to consume He Qun\u2019s blood. Meanwhile, Zhuo Hang\u2019s big trap skills were still kept.</p><br/><p>In the skills exchange above, Canglan gained the advantage of two big moves.</p><br/><p>Qin Mo and He Qun\u2019s cooperation made a lot of trouble for Xiao Han and Zhuo Hang but Zhuo Han\u2019s cooperation on this map was extremely tacit. The narrow passages were covered with Zhuo Hang\u2019s traps and the two members of Wind Colour found it difficult to move!</p><br/><p>In the end, the two of them seized an opportunity to kill. Zhuo Hang used a silence trap to control He Qun while Xiao Han quickly took away the residual blood Qin Mo.</p><br/><p>[Frost Descends has killed Shepherd!]</p><br/><p>Once Qin Mo died, Xiao Han immediately turned to help Zhuo Hang. Zhuo Hang opened his big move, Trap Blast and killed He Qun!</p><br/><p>[Great Navigator has killed Surrounding Mountains!]</p><br/><p>In the first stage of the arena, the two newcomers of Canglan actually completed the double kill!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Xiao Han\u2019s bedroom door was closed, probably because he still hadn\u2019t recovered from the time difference.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu opened the bedroom door to take a look and found Xiao Han lying sideways on the bed. His blond hair covered his white forehead and his lips were slightly pouted, making him look like a little angel.</p><br/><p>He was reluctant to wake Xiao Han up but the training time was approaching. Li Cangyu had to walk over and gently touch Li Cangyu\u2019s hair. \u201cXiao Han, get up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han sat up in a daze, rubbing his eyes and asking with confusion, \u201cMaster\u2026 what time is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is almost 8 o\u2019clock. Get up and have breakfast.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Xiao Han quickly got dressed, washed his face and brushed his teeth. Then he followed behind his master.</p><br/><p>The four people headed to the dining room of the Dragon Warriors Club. The rectangular tables were neatly arranged with many players burying their heads to eat breakfast. They couldn\u2019t help thinking about the student canteens.</p><br/><p>The club had a special chef responsible for cooking for the team members. It was a buffet style and they didn\u2019t need to pay. Any member of the Dragon Warriors Club could take a plate and pick any food.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu walked to the breakfast window and saw the vice-captain Li Xiang holding a plate. He took many things in portions of two. Not far away, the coach Qin Ye was sitting and waiting. Li Xiang was obviously taking a portion of food for him.</p><br/><p>Li Xiang was very hospitable and walked over to say hello to Li Cangyu. \u201cCat God, you came!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled. \u201cGood morning Vice-Captain Li.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m not used to you calling me that.\u201d Li Xiang took the plates and walked forward, taking the initiative to introduce this place. \u201cThe dining place of the Dragon Warriors is excellent. The bread on that side is delicious. It was just made so Cat God can taste it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Li Cangyu walked with him to take a piece of bread, fried eggs and milk. Then he praised, \u201cThere is a lot of variety!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBreakfast is served daily with bread, milk, soy milk, etc. There will be even more dishes for lunch and dinner.\u201d Li Xiang continued, \u201cIf you aren\u2019t used to eating at the canteen, you can go out on weekends to buy food. There is a shopping centre opposite here and there is a fine food area on the seventh floor. There are the grilled fish and pickled fish that you love.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiang was like a guide NPC in the game for novices. He was too dedicated.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu\u2019s eyes lit up at the mention of fish. \u201cI will try the fine foods city another day!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then Bai Xuan and the others also arrived. Li Cangyu beckoned and let everyone find a table to sit down on.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong saw Li Xiang taking a plate to serve Qin Ye and laughed. Then he asked, \u201cVice-Captain Bai, what do you like to eat? I will go and help you get it.\u201d He decided to curry favour with Vice-Captain Bai so that he might not have to wash the dishes later.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan looked at the plentiful breakfast dishes and said, \u201cTake a bit of each one to see which is delicious.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d Xie Shurong quickly ran to grab the breakfast.</p><br/><p>The young teenagers entered a team canteen for the first time and looked at the window displaying all types of delicious foods with bright eyes. In particular, Li Xiaojiang had seen \u2018inclusive of room and board\u2019 when signing the contract yesterday. He thought he would have to eat fast food or boxed lunches. He didn\u2019t expect the club to have a special canteen.</p><br/><p>Everyone was a newcomer and they didn\u2019t dare mess around. Fortunately, Xiao Gu was familiar with this place and led everyone forward. \u201cGo up and get the food. There is no need to pay for it so don\u2019t hesitate.\u201d He was like a little master.</p><br/><p>The four young teenagers lined up for breakfast. Xiao Gu took the lead, Xiao Han and Zhuo Hang were in the middle and the shy Li Xiaojiang hung his head at the end. This scene made Li Cangyu\u2019s mood instantly improve.</p><br/><p>He saw these four little guys and suddenly had the sense of being a \u2018parent.\u2019</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Not long afterwards, Liu Chuan, Lan Weiran and Wu Zewen walked in together.</p><br/><p>Lan Weiran had his hands in his pocket and inspected the canteen like a leader. Once he finished turning around, he touched his chin and commented, \u201cThis canteen is good. The Dragon Warriors Club is becoming better and better.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan stated proudly, \u201cOf course! Look at who the boss is!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lan Weiran picked up a plate and consciously looked for Li Cangyu. They sat at a table and Qin Ye followed him. Then Qin Ye took the initiative to talk with Bai Xuan. \u201cVice-Captain Bai, if you have stomach problems then it is better to have a cup of hot milk in the morning. I used to have stomach problems and milk with bread is easier for digestion.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Bai Xuan nodded with a smile before yelling into the distance. \u201cA\u2019Shu, bring me back a glass of milk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong replied, \u201cOkay!\u201d</p><br/><p>The four long tables connected together sat more than a dozen people. Li Cangyu couldn\u2019t help thinking of the class committee sitting in a row in the dining hall.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu looked at Lan Weiran bending his head to drink milk and couldn\u2019t help wondering, \u201cSi Lan, where did you live last night? I didn\u2019t see you come back here after dinner.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lan Weiran replied, \u201cI\u2019m staying in the opposite hotel. This time, I mainly came back to see the situation of the club and the new team. I will be returning to Shanghai tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Ye asked, \u201cYou can\u2019t stay for a few more days?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lan Weiran spoke around a mouthful of bread. \u201cI have something else to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Ye made an expression like he understood. \u201cAre you going to travel again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lan Weiran nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan sat opposite Li Cangyu and smiled. \u201cCat God, the new players can keep eating in the dining hall. It is convenient and clean. The canteen chef is a local and is good at Hunan cuisine. Are you used to eating Hunan food?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu replied, \u201cI don\u2019t mind eating anything but Bai Xuan has stomach problems. Xiao Han is also from abroad and isn\u2019t accustomed to spicy food.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan said, \u201cThat isn\u2019t a problem. I will tell the chef to do more light meals.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, the Gu Siming quartet came back with food. Gu Siming saw Liu Chuan sitting here and asked with surprise, \u201cHow did Boss come to the canteen?\u201d</p><br/><p>Boss Liu didn\u2019t usually spend a lot of time in the team, let alone eat in the dining hall.</p><br/><p>\u201cI came to see how you are eating.\u201d Liu Chuan\u2019s gaze swept over Li Xiaojiang, who was sitting silently in the corner. He couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cXiao Li, you are too thin. You should eat more delicious food and build up fat within a year.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang was flattered about being called out and stuttered, \u201cI, I know. I will eat, eat more.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan smiled and touched the head of the young boy.</p><br/><p>Wu Zewen came over with a plate and sat next to Liu Chuan. He looked at Li Cangyu and said, \u201cCat God, I sorted out the information of the second division teams and the map library\u2019s data in the past few days. I will give it to you in the afternoon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled. \u201cThank you Captain Wu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan interjected. \u201cYou are welcome. My Zewen is an expert. He used to be a school tyrant and likes to organize information.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Zewen glanced at him. \u201cYou love to boast too much. Don\u2019t keep exaggerating things about me, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan laughed. \u201cI can\u2019t help it. Who told you to be born so good?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Zewen, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Ye frowned. \u201cI lost my appetite sitting next to Liu Chuan.</p><br/><p>Lan Weiran also said, \u201cIt is too early in the morning for such a cheap mouth. Zewen, quickly put an egg in his mouth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Wu Zewen took the initiative to shove a peeled egg into Liu Chuan\u2019s mouth. The hated Boss Liu had to eat the egg with an innocent face.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu looked at the scene and couldn\u2019t help laughing.</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan was often scorned by Qin Ye and Lan Weiran and they bickered from time to time. However, the friendship between these people hadn\u2019t changed for many years.</p><br/><p>He hated the intrigue between players so Li Cangyu hoped that the new team would be infected by the relaxed and warm atmosphere of the Dragon Warriors Club, with everyone being friends.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>After breakfast, everyone headed to the training room together.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu walked with Wu Zewen and asked in a concerned manner, \u201cThe playoffs for Wulin have already started, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Unlike Miracle which had one season a year, Wulin was divided into the spring and autumn seasons. March to July was the spring season while the autumn season was from September to December. December was when the most intense playoffs stage for autumn occurred.</p><br/><p>Wu Zewen nodded. \u201cYes, the players are busy training these days.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan added, \u201cCat God, I discussed it with Zewen last night. I think it is better to temporarily separate the training rooms of the two teams. It is more convenient for teammates to discuss problems without being afraid of influencing the other team. There is only one meeting room with a projector. The team who wants to use it will discuss it with the other side in advance so you don\u2019t clash.\u201d</p><br/><p>With so many newcomers, Li Cangyu definitely needed separation. If the old and new teams were put together, it was easy to affect the other side. There was no need to worry about this if they were separated. Liu Chuan was obviously being thoughtful.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is better.\u201d Li Cangyu asked, \u201cCan I use the meeting room today?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d Wu Zewen said, \u201cI have been meeting in the training room recently so you can have the meeting room.\u201d</p><br/><p>The group separated at the entrance of the training room. The players of Dragon Warriors started to nervously prepare for the playoffs while Li Cangyu took his team to the meeting room.</p><br/><p>There was an oval table in the meeting room and a podium connected to the computer and projector. Li Cangyu turned on the computer and inserted a USB. He flipped through files while saying, \u201cFind a place to sit. They will be your seats for the meetings after today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone quickly found a place to sit down. Li Cangyu opened a PPT document and said, \u201cToday, I will give you a basic course. Xiao Bai, A\u2019Shu and Old Zhang don\u2019t need to listen. The other four must listen carefully.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan saw the serious man on the podium and couldn\u2019t help smiling.</p><br/><p>Cat God\u2019s class finally started again.</p><br/><p>When Li Cangyu led the team in Wulin, every time there was an important event, Li Cangyu would stand on the podium and carefully analyze the lineup and formulate tactics. After half a year, Cat God once again stood on the podium as a teacher although the students had completely changed.</p><br/><p>Looking back, Bai Xuan saw that the four teenagers had their ears pricked to listen. Li Xiaojiang even took out a notebook to take notes.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu continued saying, \u201cIn today\u2019s lesson, we are going to talk about the basic features of the Miracle classes. Several of you might be knowledgeable and proficient in the class you are playing, but you don\u2019t know other classes very well. As a professional player, we must know the skills of all classes, including effects, timing of release and even the movements. You must keep all of this in mind when facing opponents on the field to know how to deal with them.\u201d</p><br/><p>He spoke as he opened a PPT. The title on the first page was: Miracle\u2019s Full Class Details.</p><br/><p>However, the author was written as: Wind Colour team, Ling Xuefeng.</p><br/><p>Everyone was stunned when seeing this name. Captain Ling\u2019s name actually appeared in the Canglan team\u2019s meeting\u2026</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan coughed and said, \u201cDid you directly take the data from Wind Colour?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled and said, \u201cTime is short so I borrowed the PPT from Ling Xuefeng.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Captain Ling was really generous to lend this to him!</p><br/><p>This type of basic data was also available on the official website but Captain Ling just made it more detailed. There were no secrets like tactics and lineups included. It was harmless to lend this to Cat God.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu pressed the laser pointer and changed it to the next page. This page listed all the classes and races of Miracle.</p><br/><p>There were a total of 12 Miracle classes. There were the four melee classes: the paladin, berserker, swordsman and assassin. The black magician, white magician, bard and summoners were the four ranged classes. There were the two healing classes of the priest and sacrifice. Finally, there were the auxiliary psychic and the hunters who relied on traps to attack.</p><br/><p>There were six races, mainly the beast species, terran, angels, demons, blood kin and elves.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu pointed the laser pointer at the race row and said, \u201cWe should all know the six races. The beast race has the highest defense, the terran are even overall, the elves have the fastest movement speed, the blood kin\u2019s advantage lay in stealth and attack, the demons have strong magic and give negative statuses, while the angels also have strong magic but they have more control abilities.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBased on the classes chosen by the different races, the final stats must be different.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter many years of verification, there are 20 different types of builds that can be played. I will give you a detailed analysis of each one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst of all, the paladin is the main defense for a melee class. The most popular builds are the beast paladin and terran paladin. The former has the strongest defense but their bodies are heavy and their actions will be slow. The latter\u2019s defense is slightly weaker and their advantage is their flexibility when it comes to actions. The most commonly used skills of the paladin are Guardian\u2019s Power and Protection Light\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s voice was like flowing water in the meeting room.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu\u2019s speech was very clear and every word was loud.</p><br/><p>He had a good voice and was tall and handsome. Once he stood on the podium to give a lecture, he had a calm and talkative style that made people look at him.</p><br/><p>The four young teenagers looked up and listened carefully, adoration filling their faces.</p><br/><p>The old players like Bai Xuan, Xie Shurong and Zhang Jueming had clearly mastered this knowledge but they still listened with relish to Cat God\u2019s lecture.</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan, the owner of the meeting room, saw the scene of Cat God giving a lecture to the kittens. He couldn\u2019t help smiling happily. He really didn\u2019t choose wrong when he chose to sign Cat God to the Miracle branch. This confident Cat God would surely take this brand new team step by step towards the throne that belongs to him!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

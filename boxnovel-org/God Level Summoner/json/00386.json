Last time, the presence of the parents meant Xie Shurong didn\u2019t dare explore Bai Xuan\u2019s house. Today, only Bai Xuan was at home and Xie Shurong didn\u2019t need to be scrupulous. He entered the house and asked with a smile, \u201cWhich room is yours? I want to see where you live?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis side.\u201d Bai Xuan opened his bedroom door. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing special.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong walked in and saw that the bedroom was as clean and tidy as he imagined. The wallpaper and bed were a soft beige tone, so that the whole room seemed extraordinarily warm. There was a photo frame on the table that showed Bai Xuan in his youth. His facial features hadn\u2019t fully developed and he looked young as he smiled at the camera.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have any photos of when you were a child? Xie Shurong looked back at Bai Xuan. \u201cCan you show me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so good about photos as a child?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey help me get to know you better.\u201d Xie Shurong smiled. \u201cIf you like someone then you want to know their past. I am especially curious about when you were young.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Bai Xuan smiled helplessly and turned to get a photo album. Xie Shurong sat on Bai Xuan\u2019s bed and casually watched it. As a child, Bai Xuan had particularly lovely white skin while his eyes were black and big. He was very fond of smiling. In most of the photos, he was smiling at the camera and this made Xie Shurong want to pinch Xiao Bai\u2019s face in the photos.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan saw that this person\u2019s smile had become darker and deeper and couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cWhat are you smiling at? Do I look funny when I\u2019m a kid?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were very cute, worthy of being the person I like.\u201d Xie Shurong took the photo album and kissed the child in the photo. Bai Xuan was embarrassed by this action and grabbed the photo album. \u201cYou can kiss the seven year old child!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong glanced at Bai Xuan. \u201cWhether it is seven or seventy, I am willing to kiss as long as it is you.\u201d</p><br/><p>His eyes were so earnest that Bai Xuan\u2019s heartbeat sped up. He didn\u2019t dare look at this person for a moment and turned to look out the window. The words \u2018seventy\u2019 made Bai Xuan imagine the two old men together. It wasn\u2019t beautiful but it made Bai Xuan feel warm. This type of feeling was light, like sweetened candy that seeped into the bottom of his heart.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>In the afternoon, Bai Xuan wanted to accompany Xie Shurong for a stroll. As a result, they had just walked out the door when they saw a girl standing at the door with several books in her arms. It was Bai Ning, Bai Xuan\u2019s cousin.</p><br/><p>This girl had listened to Bai Xuan\u2019s words yesterday. She returned home and sorted out a bunch of information about e-sports players. She wanted to ask her cousin about them only to see a tall and handsome boy standing next to him. Bai Ning was stunned and immediately put down the books as she threw herself at him. \u201cAh Shu! Are you Ah Shu? I like you the most!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong was frightened and glanced at Bai Xuan with confusion. Bai Xuan helplessly introduced them, \u201cThis is my cousin, Bai Ning.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong sighed with relief when he heard this and hugged Bai Ning. \u201cHello, I am Xie Shurong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Ning was excited. \u201cLooking closely, the real person is more handsome than the photo!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong wasn\u2019t modest and naturally replied, \u201cI also think I am more handsome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Bai Xuan was silent for a moment and glanced back at this sister. \u201cDid you come to find me for something?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh Brother, yesterday you said that I need the foundation if I want to be an e-sports player. I bought some books to ask you questions.\u201d Bai Ning smiled and handed the books to him. \u201cBrother, can you let Ah Shu be my teacher for a while? I also like to play a swordsman\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan hadn\u2019t managed to speak when Xie Shurong smiled and promised. \u201cNo problem, if you have any questions then ask me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it really okay?\u201d Bai Nine glanced at him expectantly.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong nodded and spoke gently, \u201cOf course, Bai Xuan\u2019s sister is my sister.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan\u2019s ears were hot when he heart this but since his sister came, he immediately called the two people into the house.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong thought that Bai Xuan\u2019s cousin was very cute. This little girl\u2019s character was lively and she had a clear mention state. She was different from Bai Xuan\u2019s gentleness and carefulness. Xie Shurong was the only child at home and naturally treated Bai Xuan\u2019s sister as his own sister, patiently answering her strange questions.</p><br/><p>For the afternoon, Xie Shurong patiently answered various strange questions and taught her how to play the swordsman. Bai Ning\u2019s excited laughter came from the study from time to time, mixed with Xie Shurong\u2019s explanations. This made Bai Xuan\u2019s heart feel a bit funny.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t expect that this childish Ah Shu could be so good when helping Bai Xuan\u2019s sister.</p><br/><p>In order to reward him, Bai Xuan personally cooked a sumptuous dinner. Xie Shurong and Bai Ning smelt it and came to the restaurant. They chatted while eating and had obviously become very familiar during the afternoon.</p><br/><p>Bai Ning asked curiously, \u201cBrother Shu, do you have a girlfriend?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Xie Shurong replied with a smile. He had a boyfriend and it was her brother.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what do you like?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI like\u2026\u201d Xie Shurong wanted to saw her brother but he saw Bai Xuan\u2019s stare and immediately changed his words. \u201cI like a gentle person with a good temper who is easy to get along with.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. \u201cBai Ning satisfied her curiosity and turned to ask Bai Xuan, \u201cBrother, what about you? What type do you like? Are you too busy to fall in love?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan almost choked. He coughed a few times before changing the topic. \u201cEat more. You are too thin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her mouth was blocked with a rib and Bai Ning stopped talking. She ate the food in the bowl and chattered with Xie Shurong for a while before leaving in a satisfied manner.</p><br/><p>Once she left, Xie Shurong spoke, \u201cYour sister is very talented. I think she is a good seedling and can perhaps become a female player later. I gave her my Q number and will teach her in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan wondered, \u201cWhy are you suddenly so kind?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong smiled. \u201cDidn\u2019t I say it? Your sister is my sister. Your family, I will treat as my own family.\u201d</p><br/><p>The simply sentence moved Bai Xuan.</p><br/><p>Bai Ning\u2019s personality was actually a bit annoying. Generally, men couldn\u2019t stand such girls pestering them with questions, especially when some of the questions were quite childish. Yet Xie Shurong patiently answered them all afternoon because of Bai Xuan.</p><br/><p>-Your family, I will treat as my own family.</p><br/><p>This sentence was lethal to Bai Xuan. It was actually stronger than \u2018I like you.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was only when a person really wanted to be with someone that they would attach so much importance to family. Falling in love wasn\u2019t the same as getting married. Once a loved one was brought to see the family, it meant there was a plan to live with them.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t until this moment that Bai Xuan discovered he was deeply trying to get along with Xie Shurong. Otherwise, who could he bring them back to meet his parents? How could he watch his mother give the jade pendant to Xie Shurong without objection?</p><br/><p>It turned out that unconsciously, his heart had already fallen completely.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan felt surprised but he was very calm.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong wasn\u2019t in line with his original ideal type but what did it matter? As long as the two of them treated each other sincerely, their days could be peaceful and beautiful.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan smiled softly as he watched Xie Shurong actively run to the kitchen to wash the dishes.</p><br/><p>He finally found the person he could sincerely entrust his heart to and was very satisfied. He decided to give Xie Shurong a promotion and salary increase this evening. As for the specific salary increase\u2026 he would let Ah Shu be willful and make a request.</p><br/><p>After sending away Bai Ning, Xie Shurong consciously went to the kitchen to wash dishes. By the time he came out, Bai Xuan had already taken a shower. He was sitting at the table and thinking carefully. Xie Shurong cheekily walked to him and hugged the other person, placing his chin on Bai Xuan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWhat are you thinking about? Is it me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan didn\u2019t refute him and smiled. \u201cYes, I was thinking about you. You\u2019ve been doing well recently and as the boss, I\u2019ve decided to give the regular employee a pay rise.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong excitedly hugged him. \u201cReally? What is the pay rise method? Is it a kiss or\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan reached out and touched his chin. \u201cGo and take a shower.\u201d</p><br/><p>The meaning of this sentence was obvious and Xie Shurong immediately smiled. \u201cI understand, Boss. I must wash myself clean.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan saw him rush like the wind into the bathroom with his toiletries. Bai Xuan was both amused and nervous at the same time.</p><br/><p>Did he really want to extend their physical relationship? Wasn\u2019t it a bit too soon? Then when he thought about it carefully, they time they dated wasn\u2019t short. From an internship to a formal relationship, it had been almost a year\u2026</p><br/><p>Since it was a mutual affection, it was normal to meet each other\u2019s physical needs. Bai Xuan took a deep breath and sat on the bed in the bedroom, thinking about what might happen next. He couldn\u2019t help his cheeks heating up.</p><br/><p>A while later, Xie Shurong came out of the shower and he was only wearing underwear.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan saw that this person was quite good when undressed. The muscles of his arms and thighs were strong but didn\u2019t look too rough. It was a well-balanced beauty. The eight pack was very eye-catching and the young and strong body approaching him made Bai Xuan\u2019s heart beat faster.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong sat down next to him with a smile and whispered, \u201cIs my body satisfactory?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan shifted his gaze and said, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong grasped Bai Xuan\u2019s hand, clasping their fingers together closely. He glanced seriously at Bai Xuan. \u201cI really want to go further with you but I don\u2019t want to force you. If you don\u2019t want to\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say I don\u2019t want to.\u201d Bai Xuan interrupted him with some embarrassment. \u201cLet\u2019s go with the flow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen shall we try it tonight?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Next part has been censored.
